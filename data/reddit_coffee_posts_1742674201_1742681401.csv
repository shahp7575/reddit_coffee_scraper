I'm an accounting student doing some casual bookkeeping, and I'm struggling with a question I can't seem to find a clear answer to.

If a business buys stock in bulk, then breaks it down into smaller units for sale, how should the inventory be tracked in MYOB or Xero?

For example:

A coffee shop buys coffee beans in 2kg bags, grinds them, and sells individual cups of coffee.

A bar purchases 1.25L bottles of alcohol and sells drinks in 30ml serves.


I can track purchases and sales, but how do I account for the transformation from bulk stock to individual units? Is there a standard way to handle this in MYOB or Xero?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

Since I hit my 50s I started working out like a mad man,  It certainly has helped my T and L.  On a fairly regular basis my erection pulls me out of a deep sleep.

I could take care of things but want to save it, you know?  For her.  Sometimes I wake her up but we get up early and its not always the right time.  Many Saturday mornings when I have this issue, I lay in bed waiting.  I do not want to wake her early with my needs.   She wakes up and only kisses my forward and heads downstairs to make coffee.  Again I could take care of it, but that's not what I want.

Our newly turned 20 month old is in his peak whiny phase. Or at least I hope so, because I don’t know how much worse it can get.

Every little thing is a huge meltdown if he doesn’t get what he wants. The only times he’s happy is when he’s outside at the park or in the backyard. Obviously this can’t be done all the tome. 

He goes to daycare and acts totally normal there. They always say “he had a great day!” When I pick him up. 

Recently we had another baby so as you can imagine, I am stretched very thin here. It’s been about 6 weeks and I don’t think his behavior is related to the baby because we’ve adjusted and he loves her a lot. I think it’s normal toddler behavior and maybe some combination of understanding more / teething etc. 

These are some examples:

1. If he wants something and we don’t give it to him, he starts to scream, and almost mimic the baby’s cry. We try to redirect or say something like “I’m sorry you’re upset that XYZ, when you’re ready to move on, we’re here”. He will melt down for a few minutes…throw himself on the floor, shriek etc. and then join us. He did this to me in a coffee shop this morning bc I wouldn’t buy him a kind bar. He then refused to eat the lunch he had and didn’t eat for the next few hours. 

2. Hitting / biting: he does this when he’s upset or overtired. We redirect and say something like “hands are for soft touches / mouths are for food” and demonstrate it to him. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. When it doesn’t, I really don’t know what to do because I don’t think he understands time out yet. 

3. Oppositional behavior: he will do something and then look at us for our reaction. For example, I’ve told him he can’t eat play-doh. He looks at me and then does it, waiting for me to react. I say something like “play-doh goes on the table” and “if you can’t keep it on the table, we will try again tomorrow”. Sometimes I have to put it away 

I am really worried we are going to somehow damage him if we don’t handle these behaviors appropriately. I come from a very strict culture that involved a lot of physical /emotional punishment (which I would never do), so I’m just going off of what I see online to do…but it doesn’t seem to be working. My husband is adamant we just need to be consistent and keep doing it. Any help or advice appreciated, or even resonance that this is normal behavior.  ",1,1742679827.0,toddlers,0,1.0,False

The dirty yellow bus pulled into the gravelly parking lot of Hollow Woods camping grounds. The black crows flew around the site and fought over the one piece of dry bread. The wooden sign creaked in the dry wind.

 

The stalkers filed one by one out of the bus. The Director met them in the car park. The Director was tall, bald and had burn scars all of his face. He held a clipboard. He tweaking his thin moustache.

 

“Okay stalkers, find your rooms, with little fuss and little noise. If you are to be the next generation. You will know how to keep very quiet.”

 

The stalkers picked up their bags and made their way to the rooms.

 

The stalkers entered their room. The Director followed them. He pulled out a huge cigar and lit it.

 

“We are here to create icons of the Slasher world, first class is tomorrow. 9 am sharp. As in Jason Voorhees Machete blade sharp.”

 

The director pulled out a metallic black fountain pen from his top pocket.

 

“Rotgut” asked the Director.

 

“Here” replied Rotgut.

 

The Director looked him up and down. “Usually we would say get those overalls cleaned up yet seeing though this is Slasher camp. We don’t mind at all.”

 

The Director’s boots creaked on the wooden floorboards.

 

“Hear that, just lost yourselves a kill” the Director went back to his clipboard.

 

“Dream weaver”.

 

“Here” said the tall, thin Goth looking female.

 

“I can’t wait to see your specialty” the director ticked the box on his white sheet.

 

“And you are Hatcher”? asked the Director to the last kid in the room.

 

Hatcher didn’t reply, he just adjusted his blood stained hockey mask.

 

“I know it’s stalker camp and silence is a thang, yet if I call your name. You reply. DO YOU HEAR ME STALKER.”

 

Hatcher replied a meek “here”.

 

“That’s better” replied the director as he ticked off his last tick for that room. A bunch of other Slashers walked past, wearing everything from overalls to tracksuits to clown costumes.

 

“You lot are over there” pointed the director.

 

“Okay everyone you get a goods night rest. I know night is where we hunt yet you are going to have to make exemptions for Slasher camp. Breakfast will be served from 7am and 9 am is your first class. Don’t be late.”

 

The Director put his pen back in his pocket and walked outside.

 

 

The door closed on the mobile class room. Icons of Horror posters were all over the walls. Frankenstein, Dracula, Wolf man, Alice Cooper, Freddy vs. Jason, Michael Myers. A smorgasbord of dread and delight.

 

The Director wrote on the whiteboard. Dried blood stains dripped from the right hand corner.

 

The class was still.

 

“You want to know what an irony of Slasher camp is? We’ve never had a school shooting”.

 

Rotgut let out a chuckle.

 

“In the back of the room, you can see a long table, on that long table there is as assortment of weapons for kills. Remember to, you can customize your own, we have everything from machetes, to knives to ropes. You need to come up with your customized killing weapons, the shinier, the bigger, the freakier, the better. I’m going to leave the room and set up on the playing field. See you down there in half an hour and no fighting.”

 

The Director grabbed his clipboard and left the room.

 

The Director set up five mannequins on the long grassed playing area. The rest of the class came down the pathway all holding an array of weapons. They lined up in a neat and cordially line.

 

“Rotgut”.

 

Rotgut pulled out a large clump of wood. He walked slowly to the first mannequin and smashed it over the head with the huge chunk. Gooey ballistic gel flew everywhere. Rotgut finished swinging and returned to the end of the line.

 

“Dream weaver”

 

Her black silk dress flowed in the wind. Her long black fingernail extended out and she stabbed all of the dummies necks. Ballistic get oozed out and down the mannequins bodies.

 

“Grievous Bodily Harm or GBH from now on” said the Director.

 

A kid dressed as a construction worker walked onto the oval and pulled out their miniature ban saw and carved up the first body.

 

The Director wrote some notes on his clipboard.

 

“Well done, everyone, break for lunch and see you in the car park at 1 am. Roast beef and chocolate mousse will be served and don’t annoy the catering lady.”

 

The Director finished his notes and left the group.

 

 

The crew assembled in the car park. The director came out holding a coffee and his clipboard.

 

“For this afternoon’s lesson, we’ve come up with the title. Stalking and Presence. You aren’t all just killers. You are a feeling, a legend. Something kids talk about on the school bus and on the playground. You are life’s undercurrent. Yet you all will rise to the top once we are through with you. “

 

The Director indicted with his clipboard where the test site was.

 

“Out there are a bunch of mannequins with sensors, your job is to approach and not trip up any of those sensors. We all will be watching from the circuit TV van and watch your results.”

 

All the Stalkers looked at each other.

 

“Comprende’”.

 

The Director slid the door on the white van, the Stalkers watched from outside.

 

Dream weaver swept the trees with the elegance of ballet dancer. She stabbed the first mannequin in the neck. Moved to the second, then the third and not one beep.

 

The Director clapped. “That is some serious stalking”.

 

He pointed to Rotgut. “You are next”.

 

Rotgut pulled out a massive bastardized version of a Swiss army knife. He went to the course and crept to a large tree, then the shrubs and bushes.

 

Rotgut alerted the sensor, then tripped over a log. He got up then was attacked by an owl.

 

“Jesus Christ Rotgut” get back here and we’ll try again tomorrow.

 

 

The Stalkers sat around the fire, roasting marshmallows and Dream weaver was playing her mobile keyboard, deep synth track.

 

The Director was roasting a sausage on the fire.

 

The sound of footprints and twigs breaking filled the camp area. A college age student wearing a flannel shirt and carrying a huge orange backpack came into the site.

 

“You all know which way to the snake river”?

 

The Director looked at him, then the Stalkers.

 

“What have we been training you idiots for, go get him.”

 

The hiker panicked and ran into the woods. The Stalkers picked up their array of weapons and gave chase.

 

The Director took a bite out of his sausage.

 

“Finally some peace and quiet around here.”

 

 

The Director locked the five locks of his apartment and lit up a cigar. He smoked away and blew the smoke out the window. He stared and took in the moonlight as it lit up the lake. An owl flew past and sat on top of the large trees.

 

The Director noticed lights coming closer, then he could see torches.

 

“Oh no”.

 

He went and smashed the alarm. He went to his desk and went to the camp radio.

 

“We are being attacked by the villagers, defend yourselves, your legacy and the camp.”

 

Villagers with guns, pitchforks and knives ran into the grounds and started to set fire to the campsite.

 

Stalkers ran outside still wearing their pyjamas and counter attacked. Dream weaver put her nails into a trucker. Rotgut took out two Karen’s with decisive swings.

 

The Director ran to the car park avoiding numerous attackers. A villager tackled him to the ground. The villager lifted up a huge rock and was poised to slam it into his face. An Arrow hit the villager in the back. The rock going off to the side. The Director could see Grievous Bodily Harm holding a camp issued bow an arrow. The Director saluted and scrammed for the van.

 

He slammed the key into the ignition. The van wouldn’t start. The Director rolled down the window.

 

“Can you kids give me a push”?

 

A number of Stalkers went to the back of the van and pushed and pushed. The van slowly moved and got a roll on. It was downhill and the van rolled away.

 

The Director looked into the rear view mirror and could see the camp on fire. He tried the key again and the van finally started. The Director drove off into the night. He checked the rearview again and Dream weaver was holding on to the roof.

 

The morning shone its first light onto the camp. Fire and ash and smoke were everywhere. A trap door opened spilling ash everywhere. Rotgut emerged holding a smoldering log. Rotgut closed the trapdoor and walked off into the forest.

Need your help here. I am from Hyderabad and was travelling from Rajkot to Ahmedabad on the 6:00 pm to 10:40 pm Volvo bus. I was in the last 3 rd row window seat and she sat before me.

I was damn interested in talking to her from the moment I saw her. She did seem interested but I did not make the first move. She was watching Zakir Khan and Shark Tank videos on her phone and I was sneak peaking as much as possible.  Not to be creepy but to show her that I am interested. I believe she did realise and was interested as well. I kept my hand on her seat and she kept sleeping on my hand without any issues, sometimes give a glance from corner of her eye. I did take my hand off the first time. She turned around saw and went back to doing her work. Then again she kept her head on my hand and was very comfortable with the touch this went on for an hour. I took my chance and spoke to her if she is ok me keeping my hand on her head rest. She said that’s fine. All the while checking and refreshing what I thought was Instagram. She next got down while I was trying to get to know her. While leaving I realised she was showing Happn app and I did not have a profile on it. By the time I created my profile, I was in the bus almost a kilometre away.

Now my friends, If anyone has a friend who travelled today, do let her know that I am still searching and staying back in Ahmedabad the weekend hoping that I cross paths with her and I find her again on Happn. Or you can DM me. This is the first time I reached out to a girl and want to make it count by having a cup of coffee with her. ",0,1742678752.0,ahmedabad,2,0.5,False

Hi guys,

As we approach summer, I have this coffee table that I'd like to restore/refinish and this is going to be my first time of doing something like that. I have tried to capture a couple of imperfections from up close to give you all an idea that its not just regular wear and tear that needs to be taken care of. I went thru a couple of Reddit posts and YouTube videos to get an idea of the process but I think it got me confused more than it helped. Could someone please help me with a step-by-step process to work on this project? I'd really appreciate if you could also help me with the list of things (with brand names, if possible), including even the basics like different types of cloth pieces to wipe different things (stripper, stain, etc.) off, that I'd need to finish this. If it helps, I have also included a picture of a table in the color I'd like to paint mine.

Apart from my previous ask, I'd also like to know the following:

1. What is a stripper? What are different kinds?
2. Veneer vs stain vs lacquer and their different kinds?
3. Different types of sanders and which one would be adequate for this job? Since I am not a professional, is there a do-it-all kind which I can buy and would be useful in these house projects?

Thank you.",0,1742678650.0,furniturerestoration,1,0.5,False

I’ll keep it short, but like it says in the title, I (F27) had a (what I thought was pretty close) friend (M26) at work, who was part of a friend group of 3 there with me, but we’d also hang out and get lunch/coffee together once in a while when the other friend wasn’t in. We’d also text relatively frequently, like every few days, about work or non-work stuff (memes, shared interests, etc). We used to talk every day at work too, and nothing seemed weird. A few months ago, he got engaged to someone he met 2 months prior (she lives in another state), and ever since then his behavior towards me has changed significantly. He no longer starts any conversations, acts kind of unfriendly when I try to talk to him, and even when we have to meet about work stuff acts like it’s a bummer or something. It’s really weird, and I’m honestly pretty sad about it. I noticed he hasn’t changed his behavior towards anyone else. At first I didn’t say anything because I figured he was just stressed or something, but now that it’s gone on for a couple months, I don’t know. Now that he’s acted this way too I feel a bit too vulnerable to go up to someone who’s been kind of mean/dismissive lately and ask about this, but I’m open to it.

Has anyone been through something like this, or have any advice about what’s going on and what I should do? I want to be a good friend, but I’m not sure this person wants my friendship anymore. Which hurts, you know?

TLDR: I’m (F27) not sure how to understand or act around friend (M26) who started acting closed off since getting engaged. Advice or similar experiences welcome 🙏🏻",0,1742678619.0,relationship_advice,4,0.5,False

1jhizue,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1jhizue/i_18f_kissed_another_guy_at_the_start_of_my/,I (18F) kissed another guy at the start of my current (5 month) relationship and don’t know if my boyfriend (18M) will ever forgive me,"My boyfriend and I have been together for around 5 months, we met near the beginning of university. For the week or two prior to expressing interest in each other, I had had a little thing with another of my friends, we’ll call him K. 

K and I were nothing big, we flirted and made out a few times, I liked him but was struggling to get through to him, I knew it was never going to work. He went home one weekend and another new member of the friend group was out as well, I’ll refer to him as O. O and I had only met a few times prior to this, we got along but I was focused on K and therefore hadn’t paid as much attention to O as I wish I had from the beginning. O was fresh out of a relationship with his highschool girlfriend, but expressed a lot of interest in me, and from there I began viewing him the same way.

O and I went out for coffee the next day, where we began to bond. From there, we decided to not see other people but to not begin an actual relationship as we didn’t want to be insanely hasty and wanted to see where things would go with time. O was well aware that I had had a thing with K, he has witnessed it, in fact there was a couple of jokes about it, and at this point I hadn’t even told K that I was doing anything with O. It felt uncomfortable and it didn’t matter anyway, because I don’t think he had been emotionally invested in me in any way.

The next weekend, I got really drunk and kissed K again (who found out earlier that night about O and I), because I honestly wasn’t sure about my feelings. I know it was a horrible thing for me to do, and I regret it constantly, but it truly made me realise that O was what I wanted and that we’d be best for each other. I told O almost instantly, as soon as I could really text him. He made it clear he was upset and needed to think, but we were great again after a couple of days. A few weeks pass and the two of us become an official relationship.

Since then, I have tried my absolute hardest to prove that nothing like that will happen again and assure him that it was a mistake and I regret it severely. And it’s generally fine, we’re amazing together and so genuinely happy, I’m good for him and he’s good for me.

Tonight is one of those nights where he’s out drinking with his friends and had brought it up again. There tends to be a theme, he drinks and 50% of the time there’s an issue brought up again, even if he seems fine the vast majority of the time.

Tonight he once again asked why I kissed K that night, and I gave him the same honest explanation I do every time. And I don’t fault him for being upset with me over it, he has every right to be, we had agreed to not see other people a couple days prior, it was a breach of trust right off the bat which obviously would set a bad precedent to anyone. But every time I give an explanation or we have one of these conversations, my words get twisted and he accuses me of not loving him and such. “It proves you want someone else”, “you can’t love me very much if you kissed someone else”, and my struggle with this is that it was a week into seeing him and it’s been over 5 months since then. 

Obviously I can’t expect him to be over it, but I don’t think my actions a week into seeing someone in a romantic light are at all indicative of how much I love him now, which is how he seems to view it.

I know what I done was incredibly hurtful and that I’m an awful person it, he didn’t deserve that at all, but I need to know, is this doomed because of it? This isn’t the first time this conversation has happened, but it’s been a couple of months since last time. I worry it will never stop, and he’ll continue to think that I don’t love him and want someone else because of it.

I apologise for the extremely long story, thank you if you read it all.

We met in high school, ended up attending the same CEGEP, and are now in university together. When we were 19 and 20, we moved in together—not as a couple, but just to be closer to school

I had a massive crush on her back in high school, and luckily, as we lived together, she developed feelings for me too. A few months after moving in, we officially became a couple

Our relationship has been a bit… routine. We’re both broke thanks to rent, bills, groceries, school- you know the drill. Our schedules barely line up—my classes run from 8 AM to noon, and I work from 1 PM to 10 PM, while she has classes from 12 PM to 6 PM. That means we only really see each other at night when we’re sleeping and on Sundays (my only day off). Even then, we mostly just worked on school stuff in the same room rather than actually spending time together

We still showed love in small ways—leaving little notes, making each other coffee, surprising each other with tiny gifts—but we weren’t really *dating*. And that led to some fights. We both felt lonely, but I was always too busy to fix it. Eventually, I cut my work hours, taking three nights off per week, even though it meant sacrificing things I enjoyed (goodbye, snacks and new books). But I wanted to spend more time with her, so it felt worth it

At first, it was great! We had dinner together, watched movies, and just enjoyed each other’s company. Then… she decided to rewatch *Harry Potter*. No big deal—I know she loves the series. But then we watched it *again*. And *again*. And *again*. And for the past *four months*, we’ve been cycling through the entire saga every. single. week

Last night, I finally snapped. I suggested watching *Interview with the Vampire*, *Star Wars*, or even *Twilight*—literally *anything* different but still in her favourite fantasy genre. To sweeten the deal, I made her favourite dinner (Philly cheesesteaks) in hopes that she’d be happy enough to compromise

She was thrilled when she got home. We ate, talked about our day, then curled up on the couch. But when she grabbed the remote and started *Harry Potter* again, I gently asked if we could switch things up

She did *not* take that well.

She immediately got angry, yelling that I had been “lying to her this whole time” about supporting her interests. She asked why, if I hated *Harry Potter* so much, I didn’t just take more work shifts again. Then she told me to go to bed so she could watch alone.

That pissed me off. I told her I didn’t *hate* the movies, but after four months, I was just *over it*. I reminded her that I took off work hours so we could spend *quality* time together doing things we *both* enjoy—so me going to bed alone kind of defeated the point. I also asked why she couldn’t just watch *Harry Potter* on the nights I wasn’t there

Apparently, that was *the* most offensive thing I could’ve said, because she packed a bag and left to stay at our friend’s apartment. I went to bed.

Now I’m just confused. I’ve been trying to call and text her all day, but she won’t respond. The only message I got was from our friend, who told me to “leave her alone and give her time to decompress.” I texted back, asking them to tell her that I was sorry and to call me when she’s ready—but I got left on read.

I don’t know what I did wrong. All I wanted was to watch a different movie, and now my girlfriend has disappeared, crying. I feel bad for hurting her, but I’m also frustrated because she won’t tell me *why* she’s so upset or why she refuses to watch literally *anything* else

So, Reddit… am I the asshole?

My mom and dad divorced when I was 7 years old because my dad was reckless with spending, drinking excessively and overall was lazy and couldn’t keep a job. They would constantly argue and be rude to each other which created a lot of anxiety and tension for me. This would cause my father to drink more and my mother would have to hide alcohol in the house or garbage it. I swear to god my emetophobia started because of him throwing up everywhere and being loud about it after his drunken nights. My dad is an immigrant from a Caribbean country and came to my country I live in a year before I was born, he does struggle with language barriers and struggles to read and write well. (I know it’s random but it’s part of the story). Anyways when I was 7 when my parents split I was devastated and I chose to stay with my mom. We then moved to my grandmothers house cuz we could not afford to stay at the house we had prior because of the now divorce of my parents and my dad moving out on his own. When this happened I didn’t not receive a phone call or anything from my father for 2 years. I was devastated and confused why he wasn’t answering. My grandmother would take me to his apartment to see if he was home and he never was until one day. Little me knocked on his door and he was shocked, he had been drinking for sure and said he had no money for me when that is not why I was there. I simply just wanted to see him and see how he was doing because I knew his habits and his way of life. Anyways, after that I didn’t talk or see him until I was about 12 years old and we met for coffee together. It was awkward and weird.. can’t remember much from that. I am now in my early 20s and have not seen my dad in person since I was 16 at a family event and he was drunk at lmao. Weeks after this event he calls me constantly (10 times a month) while I am at work, university, out with friends etc. and asks me for money and to google search things for him because he cannot read. This has been getting to me and I feel guilty choosing to not meet up with him or helping him out. I know his life growing up was hard and he struggled with reading and writing which has brought on more challenges for him however, he neglected me as a child and exposed me to his vices which effected my mom and I. I’m confused and not sure what to do about this, i genuinely feel my mood worsen when I see his calls because I know he will never ask me how I am, how work is, how university is or how I’m doing, only to ask for money or for anything else I can provide him. I’m not sure what to do as I’ve attempted to go no contact for a year and it got around to my other side of the family about me not talking to him and him wanting to talk.

1jhiupx,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jhiupx/anxiety/,Anxiety,"Hi! We are in our second month of officially “trying” (but not that hard). The two week wait period is so anxiety provoking for me. My norm is to have 3-4 caffeinated beverages per day and now with maybe being pregnant I’m completely overthinking whether that’s causing us to not conceive. 

I barely drink alcohol but now even with a few sips I freak out that that’s doing harm. I can go on with a million other things that I start freaking out are causing harm. 

For some background, I would be considered higher risk. I’m 33, somewhat overweight (although my OBGYN has no concern about weight), and am on psych meds that could cause infertility (vyvanse and lithium). So I’m already coming against different factors. It feels crazy that we’re even trying with everything but my partner and doctors have no concerns…

Addition: I have been feeling like I could be pregnant this cycle and am tracking symptoms. I’ve been sick with a cold and exhausted (sleeping 9-10 hours and 3 hour naps during the day), acid reflux which I never have, constipation, and lots of cravings.

I am trying to figure out if I am liable for tripping, or simply not used to living with people anymore. 

Let us start at the beginning, when we first started living together she told me she didn't like that I had the guy I was seeing over to the apartment because it made her feel lonely. He would only come over once a week and if we wanted to spend more time I would go to his. Not to mention she had some dude over and was having I guess some crazy sex because I could hear her from outside screaming in her room. Next she invited a stranger over she met online. We had a discussion before ever moving in together that this could not happen because we are young women and it isn't safe. We had discussed and decided to meet them in public, even if I needed to sit in the corner of a coffee shop or someplace to ensure her safety. So I confronted her after the stranger left and she had yet 2 other strange men over, after I confronted about each of them. Even trying to lie and say ""we basically know each other because we have been texting for 5 months."" The next part is about hygiene. She doesn't shower often so her room tends to smell and linger into the living room. I am bad at confronting on that because I would not want to offend. Her clothes make the literal dryer stink. Speaking of the dryer, she will throw clothes in without checking pockets and pulls lighters out of the dryer. Then when I say please check your pockets, she is only ever mad that her lighter no longer works. This frustrates me because I find it to be a safety risk. I have seen lighters explode and if it ruined MY dryer or worse started a fire and put my cats at risk I would never forgive her. She also expects me to get her permission to have anyone come over but will allow me to walk in to see she has friends over every other night without warning. I don't care that she has friends over, but why would I have to ask permission ""at my big age""? lol. Next she sleeps 24/7, which is fine but always gets mad if I wake her by existing. She works 4 days a week for short hours and only time she's awake is when she's eating the groceries I buy. Or she gets take out and leaves it for days in the living room until I finally throw it away. She never takes the trash out and will put trash on the kitchen counter when the garbage can is full. Back to the sleeping thing, I don't care if she sleeps 24/7 but when am I allowed to make a peep if it disturbs her 16 hours of ""beauty rest""? I don't know if I needed the rant or need advice but I am honestly so depressed living with her and have no idea what to do.",1,1742677968.0,roommates,0,1.0,False

We’re all incredibly good listeners, caring individuals, eager to help and excited to hang with each other.

We’ve gone to battleaxes. We’ve gone glow bowling once and we’re going again tonight! We’re going to Activate and having a party for my birthday next month.

Went up to see my college buddies who live in a different city - I haven't seen them in 3 years, so I was very excited for this. 

We plan a big night out on the Saturday night, but two of us arrive the night before on Friday and stay at my buddy John and his gf's apartment. We get shitfaced, have an amazing night, and get some food on the way home.

I sleep in the spare room and I wake up in the morning to a horrible smell. I ignore it and go back to sleep. I wake up again, and lo and behold in the **bin** in the corner of the room is diarrhoea splattered all over the bin and the floor beside it.

I wasn't even that wasted, so I have no idea why this happened. I must have done it in my sleep? Anyway, I spend the morning hungover cleaning up this diarrhoea into a bag with loo roll - before putting it in my bag and leaving the apartment to walk to the nearest public bin under the pretence of getting a coffee. I stuff it in there and buy tonnes of detergent. I wipe down the floor, the bin, and sanitise it alongside spraying the fuck out of the room with febreeze.

I managed to totally cover my tracks but I just could not get the smell out, I did the best I could. Anyways I decided to tell them I threw up in the bin, just to provide reasonable doubt if they smelt something, but not to worry as I cleaned it up. 

This was all last weekend. It ruined the rest of the trip for me and on Saturday night I couldn't really relax and I didn't dare get too drunk or eat anything. Jesus it's so embarrassing, but something like this has never happened to me before. 

I am really ashamed of myself for this, and I feel as if they'll definitely find out what happened and my friendship is ruined. What the actual fuck.

Wanted to share, both in the shittines and success. I was at a coffee shop and felt my inner alarm going off, no real reason I could think of. Felt the panic rising. I get hot, sweaty, bad stomach, light headed, spiked heartrate. (One of my worst fears when things like this happen is that I will shit my pants) Was plotting my escape, the bathroom or run to my car and leave. Felt trapped, overwhelmed, that everyone knew I was freaking out inside. I was able to focus on my breathing, recognizing the intrusive thoughts, grounding in my body, trying to be compassionate towards myself...And the feelings started to ease off, slowly deescalating.

I recently had been feeling better and doing a lot of things that a few years prior didn't feel possible with my level of anxiety. After this episode passed my reaction was to be pretty bummed. Like I had regressed and moved backwards. But I know the goal isn't to make it go away completely but be able to move through it. And the small success of that is worth celebrating. I stayed at the Cafe, I wanted to prove to myself I was safe, that it was my head tricking me.

All that is to say that I see you all, anxiety is horrible, it robs you of your identity, personality, of enjoying life. And it sucks feeling like you're constantly fighting yourself. I've been working on it, been in therapy for years and the progress can feel excruciatingly slow. But it's possible to move through, to manage.

It feels unhealthy to take stimulants, because my heart rate and probably cortisol is high throughout the day, and I get stressed when I'm aware of it.. Part of my motivation for eating carnivore is to age slower.. 

I was on Vyvanse for 6 years, then almost 2 year long break (but high carb diet), and started them again in autumn 2024, a few months before I discovered and tried out carnivore. So I don't know really how it is being off meds this time, when my diet will be zero carb. Luckily, I only take 20 mg this time.

I get so frustrated with my ""need"" for stimulants, when I think how they increase stress and probably accelerate aging.. I just want all things to be perfect/optimal😅

Is there anyone here who has successfully quit adhd meds since going carnivore? Do you feel that zero carb actually heals the brain chemistry causing adhd symptoms?

And did your ability to resist carbs and coffee get worse, going off meds? Very important question..

If I'm going to commit going off them, I have to give it a few months at least, but I don't want to go through that suffering for no reason, so I want to be sure it's the right decision before I try again..

Hope this post won't be removed for being irrelevant, because I want answers from fellow carnivores (instead of others in adhd community with high carb diet)

We are having around 85 guests at our wedding (plus 10 vendors). We invited around 120 guests, and expected around 90 to attend. We have a beautiful venue that will fit three times that (albeit very tightly), but we are spacing tables out and leaving room for catering tables, dessert table, and a coffee bar. I say all that to say that I’m hoping it doesn’t look too “empty.” Our coordinator insists it won’t look empty as long as we have the appropriate seating and table spacing. 

When we started the process, we wanted a small, more intimate wedding. We’ve stayed true to that for the most part. We feel we’ve planned a very nice event. But now I’m having some regrets which has been made worse by having 5 people say they won’t be attending after all in the past couple of days when we are getting married THIS WEEK. I’m wondering if we should’ve invited more people, if people will think it’s too small of an event, etc. I could’ve invited acquaintances but kept it to close friends and family but now I’m wondering if we should’ve made it a larger event.

1jhikjt,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1jhikjt/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the cafés. Even the cafés can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a café, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a café wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their café and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local café can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

It almost feels like my brain is deeply exhausted - even if I have slept well. There’s a sensation as if my mind is slipping gears, or like it’s a train on a track that’s falling off the track. It comes on perhaps 8-10 times a day, perhaps a few times a week. If I’m out I feel like I struggle to stay up and talking to people, and want to just sit down and shut my eyes. Like my brain needs to sleep. 

Last year I tapered off an SSRI - Lexapro. I had been taking 10mg for nearly 11 years. The taper took close to 6 months. I have been completely off the SSRI for 5 months. This symptom only started a month ago so I’m not sure if it’s linked. It’s also not the same symptom as brain zaps which I got when I have tried to come off SSRIs before. 

I also gave up coffee last year. I only had 2/3 cups per day. I drink caffeinated tea still. Again not sure if this could be linked? 

Any ideas what this might be? I feel stupid going to my GP about it (if I can even get an appointment in my country). It is however making life challenging at times.

1. ***minigames to refill your energy.***  if the devs are going to aim to have a big online on their servers one day, they gotta think about something that would keep users in line. any basic minigame you can think of, snake eating coffees, brick hit, MATHS, puzzles with possible mascots status can have and etc. one thing — usage of the minigames might be limited per day so players wouldn't get to refill their energy that much and would probably pay for coffee (duh). 

2. ***threads.***  big reddit posts, but divided into smaller pieces of text and happening in one day about one topic. for example, you want to talk about the types of cabooms nuclear bombs make, but the bots are responding only to the last paragraph — that's why you can create a thread so ai would get a full storyline while attending to the presented topics. 

3. ***redaction of events.***  you know, lately, I've been gambling for events... i open the app, turn it on and close the app if i don't like it. yes of course we have the dates and days to set, but how about creating some events which you shouldn't roleplay for min 5 messages? I'm a lazy gambler and would settle only for one post without none responding me but the news after that, thanks. so, redaction an event to gain some points, perhaps, wouldn't be an overkill, really. 

4. ***themes for the app.***  how about... a magenta ai twitter? or, perhaps, full b/w mode, where even these 'refill your energy' things would stand in one place without a tremble and have a solid white and black color pallete. sounds great, and, as we don't have any subscription types, thankfully, users may get these color themes by logging in every day and getting boxes. i think sounds good? but, yeah, plans for the future, bigger and mightier team might do it... someday. 

of course, these are just the suggestions to think about, not orders to make out immediately. users might also ponder about the things they wanna see in status, the thing that would keep them in line. *i just want to hope, that one day...*",2,1742676871.0,statusAI,0,1.0,False

Lightroom Classic works like it's running on a Pentium IV computer as soon as I create some masks. I understand Lightroom Classic is supposed to work WAY better on Macs.

I need it 90% to run Lightroom Classic for photo editing. My general workflow is the following

Around 50 photos at a time, 33MP photos. After some color correction I use AI subject detection to create... about 8-10 masks per image (automatically select lips, eyebrows, the iris and the white parts of the eyes, etc.)

I do not need importing photos or this initial AI mask creation or exporting to be extremely fast, I can go make a coffee or scroll tiktok for a few minutes because these operations are done only once, and then I can get on with my work.

HOWEVER

In my current Windows PC, after every image has these 8-10 masks created, it start to run like absolute shit. Wanna select a different photo? Wait 5 (3-7 seconds, so 5 on average) seconds after clicking. Wanna select a mask? Change to the mask tab, 5 seconds waiting. Click on a mask to select it, 5 seconds waiting. Need to see the overlay of a mask? 5 seconds. I think I made my point. As soon as I add in the masks, performance goes back to the early 2000s

I want something that will make the actual editing be smooth, I do not want to wait several seconds every time I select another photo, or another mask on a photo, or to render the overlay of a mask.

So, my options from what I see are:

\- MBA M4 24GB

\- MBA M4 32GB (more ram)

\- MBP M4 Pro 48GB (more ram, about 2x the GPU and memory speed)

\- MBP M4 Max 48GB (even more GPU power, hope I do not need this option... id rather not spend upwards of 4.5-5k$ on a laptop)",1,1742676773.0,mac,5,1.0,False

I get frustrated with supplements and feel better for a while and stop taking them or I tried Slynd the end of the year per my GYN for suspected PMDD and bled for 50 days straight before giving up so I’m sure that tanked my iron more. The last time I checked it in December, my Ferritin was 12. But I got it in my head to meet with midi and get HRT Friday. Which I did and was prescribed the patch (.05 I think) and 100 mg of progesterone. I haven’t picked it up yet to start it. But just before the appt I realized that a lot of the things I thought were probably peri and HRT might help me with, might actually be because of my iron. I know fatigue can be either or both but just curious if anyone else has had the experience to have both and figure out the main cause? I can’t figure out the fatigue. It’s killing me. I slept fine last night. I even take meds for ADHD. But after a couple of hours up I’m utterly exhausted again even with the stimulants and coffee. I had to nap. My hands are freezing all the time. I want to do more stuff but i physically can’t make myself. I thought it was getting better for a bit but it knocked me down again this week hard. AND I have the “boobs hurt- period is going to come soon” thing. Soooo is this Peri fatigue because estrogen crashed or iron fatigue due to impending period and making the lining or blood or whatever? WTH? Sorry if this is dumb I’m just trying to decide now if I should try to get infusions or try the patch. From posts I feel like I might not be getting the energy boost I’d hoped from from the patch if I’m tired every day and still having cycles because wouldn’t my estrogen be going back up sometimes too? 

I keep getting notifications on my watch that tells me my heart rate goes up for no reason too. (Again, could be either thing) so idk… anyone care to play fortune teller and help me fix myself before I lose my job?

Working from home, coffee shops, and occasionally while traveling led to task management disaster. I'd write deadlines on my phone, project notes on my laptop, and client follow-ups in random notepads. The context-switching was destroying my productivity and threatening my professional reputation.

**The breaking point:** I was on a train after a day of remote meetings when I realized I'd completely forgotten to update a critical client deliverable. That moment cost me a weekend of emergency work and nearly lost a key account.

After testing multiple solutions specifically designed for remote work scenarios, I developed a cross-device productivity system centered around Todoist. The results transformed my remote work experience:

## What actually worked:

* **Location-based task triggers** - Created custom filters for ""home office,"" ""coffee shop,"" and ""travel"" work modes
* **Reclaimed 5+ hours weekly** previously spent context-switching between different work environments
* **Reduced missed deadlines by 90%** using synchronized notifications that follow me across locations
* **Cut Zoom preparation time in half** by having project details available on whatever device I'm using
* **Eliminated the ""which device has that file?"" frustration** when switching between workspaces

## Remote-specific workflows that made the difference:

1. **Morning planning ritual:** 10-minute review of the day's tasks regardless of where I'm working
2. **End-of-day documentation:** 5-minute summary of what was accomplished and next steps
3. **Weekly review at my primary workspace:** Deep analysis of what's working and what needs adjustment
4. **Template creation for recurring remote work scenarios:** Client updates, team check-ins, etc.
5. **Focus time blocks that sync across calendar and task manager:** Preventing schedule fragmentation

## Remote work benefits nobody talks about:

* The ability to seamlessly transition between different work environments without productivity loss
* Dramatically reduced anxiety about ""forgetting something important"" between different workspaces
* Improved communication with distributed teams since all project details are instantly accessible
* Better work-life boundaries once I stopped carrying mental work baggage across physical locations

**What's your biggest productivity pain point as a remote worker?** Has anyone else found that a unified cross-device system gave them back more time than expected?

1jhicfx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/1jhicfx/some_advice_from_an_italian_living_in_italy_to/,Some advice from an Italian living in Italy to those who want to travel to Italy to avoid scams,"If you go to Rome or the main Italian cities, pay close attention to these things:

- Never accept bracelets or necklaces from those who tell you that they are gifts, they are never gifts and will probably ask you for money back. Sometimes they throw you the bracelet so that you instinctively take it and then, as above, they try to convince you to take something out to send them away. The only advice in these cases is to completely ignore these people and not stop to talk to them at all, even at the risk of being considered rude.

- In Florence, some guys put fake paintings on the ground in the middle of the crowd, where one can easily step on them and then ask for money for compensation, they are not usually aggressive, but only slightly insistent.
Even in that case, it is better to completely ignore the people and go away pretending not to hear them.

- In Naples, as stated in the initial point, there are people dressed as Pulcinella or Neapolitan horn sellers, the former offer you a photo with them and then expect to be paid, a bit like those who are dressed as Gladiators at the Colosseum. For the latter, sellers of bracelets, horns, handkerchiefs or various knick-knacks, the approach is sometimes simply like ""Hey guys, can I ask you a favor?"" Never answer, ignore them and carry on, their goal is only to make you buy something and extort money.

- Finally, always be careful around tourist sites of those who offer to give you directions to take a photo or give you suggestions on how to do it, it is never free and always paid.

For taxis: always make sure the taximeter is on, never negotiate the price first and find out about the official rates on the websites of the municipal administrations of the cities where you are, so you can point out to taxi drivers, in the event that they propose a certain price, that theirs is too high. If you intend to pay by card, always point this out to the taxi driver first, since some use the excuse of having a broken POS to evade taxes.
Furthermore, official taxis throughout Italy are white, the others are abusive and illegal.

To eat, avoid restaurants or bars in the most central tourist streets, they are usually only crowded with tourists, especially those with waiters outside inviting you to come in, you eat badly and spend a lot.
Try to go to eat outside the tourist areas, where Italians usually go.
If you really have to go to a tourist area, even for a coffee, always ask for the menu first, at least you know how much you will spend.

To visit operas, parks, museums and monuments, always book on the official websites of the opera or museum and never buy fake tickets or tours there from those who want to extort money from you to offer you a tour at the last minute by skipping the line, they are ripping you off on the price by probably making you pay double.

1jhiae9,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXPreppers/comments/1jhiae9/maintaining_a_library/,Maintaining a Library,"**Cleaning and Maintaining a Library**

With the on-going books bans and censorship, a lot of people have gone back to purchasing physical books. Unfortunately physical books require maintaince. 

I am not a profession and hope those who are can add to the discussion. My mother was a librarian, I grew up around books (my parents owned ~6-7k), and maintain my own personal library. I am less concerned with books lasting generations but maintaining functionality. 

*Buying Used*

* Inspect for insect damage or mold. I've seen books sold with book lice, bed bugs, and even ticks.

*Foxing is the light brown spots you see on older books. This is due to oxidation and is harmless*

* Clean the book. You can clean covers with soapy water. I apply to the washcloth/paper towel rather than the book directly. Make sure it's completely dry. 

* Stickers can be removed with goo-be-gone, which is a mixture of oil and soap. Make sure to clean with soapy water afterwards so no oil residue remains. Make sure it's completely dry. 

* Sanitize with 70-90% isopropyl alcohol. 

* If books become infected with mold or insects, they can be frozen. Alternatively mold and smells can sometimes be sanitized by sunlight. Make sure it's completely thawed/dried, bug/mold free, and quarantined before before adding it back to a library. 

* Quarantine your books for 4 weeks before adding to your collection. Sometimes secondhand sellers will spray books to remove noxious odors, mold, etc without killing them. Quarantine allows you to find them before they become an issue. 

*Storage*

* Store vertically with like-sized books. Books are not constricted to be stored horiztonlly or with uneven side to side pressure. This will damage the spine and significantly decrease the lifespan. 

*There are exceptions to this, primarily coffee table books which are usually constructed to be read on a surface and stored flat*

* Consider back-justificafion. If your spines have started to slant, consider back justification rather than front. This helps support a straight spine. 

* Use book ends. These are cheap/trivial to make. 

* If you want to display books, I recommend getting book easels, which will decrease the damage to the spine and cover. These books should be switched out periodically. 

* Keep away from light. Do not store directly across from a window. This will, over time, do damage to the books. 

* Build in or secure bookcases to studs. 

* Consider doors. Dust is sticky and once dust has started to collect on a book it can become difficult to remove. Storing behind doors decreases the accumulation and work to maintain. Another consideration is that doors can be latched, child and earthquake proofing the bookcases. 

* Consider silica packets, especially if stored behind glass/doors or in humid environments. These are relatively cheap and you can reuse ones from other purchases. If you live in a place slowly being overtaken by mold, consider a dehumidifier. 

* Insect prevention: I fumigate with de (food grade) and put de traps throughout my bookcases to quickly see any infestation (thankfully none). Carpet beetle, silverfish, stink bugs, book lices, moths, and termites will damage books. Cockroaches are attached to dirty/soiled books. 

*Maintaince*

* Dust more often than you want to. 

* Check for insects and mold. 

* Check for bowing or bending shelves, redistribute books or reinforce shelves. 

* Clean and quarantine any damaged or soiled books before reshelving them. 

Repair

* Consider preventive rather than reactive measures like reinforcing spines, using or installing metal corners, using book covers, etc. 

* Patch with book tape, not duct tape.

*Insurance*

* Make sure you have pictures and/or  catalogue of your library. Backup these documents in cases of emergency. Book collections are incredibly expensive, even if you aren't purchasing ""fancy"" books.

Dry throat that gets worse after talking for prolonged periods, and having to cough to clear chest congestion after eating (doesn’t seem to matter what I eat) are my main symptoms. Been on a PPI for 3 weeks with no improvement. Have cut out coffee booze spicy and acidic foods as well as chocolate and fried foods for weeks. My symptoms are mild but consistent and don’t seem to be going away. 

I saw an ent who said I had some mucus and slight inflammation and told me to take the ppi and reflux raft. What else can I do and is it normal that this is sticking around so long ? Really want to be able to drink coffee and booze again. 

This all started shortly after a bad virus where I had chest congestion and post nasal
Drip, and a couple days after I was drinking heavily and eating fried foods on a weekend.

Any help/advice is much appreciated

I’m wealthy. Like, generational wealth, trust-fund level rich. I have all the freedom and toys anyone could want. But wealth is weird. It gets boring. Eventually, you start looking for something — anything — to make you feel alive.   

So here’s where it gets bad. Every morning, after my coffee and my… routine, I take a brand new $100 bill. I use it to wipe myself. Not a joke, not an exaggeration. I fold it neatly after, and then I go out into the city.  

I pick random spots — parks, subway stations, outside diners, even just tucked between bricks on an old building. Then I sit somewhere nearby, usually behind sunglasses, pretending to read the paper or sip coffee, and I *watch*.  

There’s always someone. Always. The cautious, the desperate, the lucky. Some people can’t believe their eyes. They look around, and then they pocket it like they just cheated life itself. Sometimes they buy coffee with it five minutes later. Sometimes they hand it to their kids like a prize. Sometimes it goes straight into a wallet next to family photos.  

It makes me feel… something. I’m not sure if it’s power, disgust, connection, maybe all of it at once. Like I’m part of their story now, invisibly. It’s gross. I know that. I know it’s a sickness.  

But the worst part? The thing that messes me up most?  
No one ever questions it. No one ever wonders where it’s been. They just see the money, and they trust it instantly.   

I don’t know why I’m telling you this. Maybe it’s guilt, maybe it’s pride. Maybe I just needed to say it out loud before I go do it again tomorrow.

1jhi242,https://www.reddit.com/r/VuldaviaRP/comments/1jhi242/autumn_cleaning/,Autumn Cleaning,"Nandor looked around at the empty field. With the moon obscured by clouds, only his headlights could illuminate the area yet he kept them off, he didn’t want anyone to know of his presence there.

In the distance he could see the shadows of tall stalks of corn, waiting to be harvested but not at that late hour.

Nandor could see the headlights of another car that pulled up behind his, until with the engine they turned off, then footsteps. 

Nandor turned to face them, three of his most trusted men and another he was expecting.

“Marton Antal.”

Standing there in an empty field, surrounded by Nandor’s men it was only going to end one way, yet he didn’t grovel or beg, he faced his demise with the upmost serenity. 

“Your men could have at least let me finish my coffee.” All Antal complained about after being held and kidnapped at gunpoint.

Nandor punched him and the man almost fell to his knees, “Your time is over. The party is mine now, fully.”

Antal looked up and scoffed, “A true leader does not need to declare he is in charge.” He noticed a little ways away from the road was a hole in the ground. 

“As we speak, my Maroon shirts are wiping out anyone who stands against me. All your fanatics and old guard friends.”

Antal just grinned, “You are unworthy. Abel would be disappointed in you turning your back on our ways.”

Antal’s continuing composure only aggravated Nandor more, “Well Abel was wrong! He hoped to bring about a master race, yet all he made was a bunch of weak minded children with have no understanding of true strength. They replaced the shackles of tradition with decadence.” Nandor drew a knife and came closer, “We must be free not just from the past but also of weakness! It’s all just a mindset. This is a new era for the NWP, one without the likes of you.”

Nandor thrust the knife into Antal’s stomach before pulling it up and out. Antal clutched his chest only to be shoved, falling into the hole very much alive.

Nandor stared down at Antal for a moment, before he picked up a shovel and began to fill it in, but even in doing so he did not get the satisfaction he sought.

All Nandor could think of is how smug Antal seemed, unphased by all he said or did, even when his death was imminent. Nandor could have swore he heard faint mocking laughter as he was buried, but that couldn’t be possible… Furthermore Anett was still distant to him, spending the night at a friend’s rather than come home with him.

Nandor wasn’t lying when he spoke of a purge. Party members who had sided with the conspiracy, whether they be old guard or the leaders of various communes, would all be taken care of.

Some heard knocks on the door, others no warning at all, but all across Vuldavia, Nandor’s enemies encountered men with pistols and rifles which would be their end in one way or another.

**”Commandant Bako sends his regards…”**

Some fled before the maroon shirts got the chance but the opposition was scattered. Nandor was free to make public appearances as if nothing had happened, even if he or the party would never be the same.",1,1742675815.0,VuldaviaRP,0,1.0,False

One day like a year ago he started talking to me about my shaky hands and that he thinks I drink too much coffee and he knows a lot about coffee and he drinks a good one he brought me some to try and I was right after break up with my ex and I liked him so I started developing feelings. He's a neighbour of my shop and my coworker told me that he doesn't have a wife and later I found out he doesn't have a girlfriend either (he has been single for a long time). I'm a shy girl and he definitely saw that I'm into him while talking to me I easily blush and he even pointed it out to me that he sees it. I was excited about him coming to the shop and talking to me every time and couldn't shut up about him to all my coworkers and they started to call me to come to the cash register every time he came and he definitely noticed that too. He always smiled at me and talked to me about coffee or he tried to persuade me to go to college and I thought it's really sweet and that he cares about me. He sometimes was telling me weird things about spanking me for not taking magnesium while I drink so much coffee and some good girl stuff but I didn't take it sexually I just thought it's his sense of humor. And there was this new co-worker (42F) employed and she is very confident with guys and she openly told him to ask me out and that I'm into him and he just smiled at it and pretended to not understand. She stopped liking me after awhile because I'm much younger than her but she had to listen to me because I'm the oldest worker in my shop and kinda a leader and she isn't very good at what she's doing so I had to criticise her quite a lot. So I don't know what more she told him about me but they definitely talked about me she even started telling me that I shouldn't worry about her taking him away because he is too young for her when I was never jealous about her and didn't even think that he could choose her over me. And the first red flag I really saw in him was that he told my other coworker (F30) to let her hair down which was rather obviously flirting. It wasn't just one time he did that repeatedly to annoy her. She doesn't like any men hitting on her and she knew I like him and she's a good friend so she was angry at him for saying that and annoying her and she stopped even greeting him and tried to avoid him. I somehow forgave him that and thought that he isn't my boyfriend so he can flirt with anyone and I can still get him. I still had a crush on him and still was excited about him until I found his Facebook. He comments on girls' revealing photos from accounts that are clearly fake that don't even have any interactions with other women just some older desperate guys simping over them maybe to scam them and I instantly got grossed out by him and I'm so embarrassed I talked so much about him and that everyone knows that I liked him and I don't know what to do when he will talk to me again. I feel a bit hurt that he knew I have feelings for him and still chose to talk to girls on the internet instead of choosing me like is there something wrong with me but also now I just find him gross and see that things he did before (like flirting with my coworker in front of me and keep annoying her when she clearly didn't like that, joking about spanking me) were creepy too. I'm also worried that if I talk to him again and he will be sweet to me that my feelings will come back despite being disgusted by his behaviour and him clearly choosing other girls instead of me. How do I keep away from him and how do I save my pride from my coworkers who know that I had a crush on him and he didn't like me back? Or maybe I'm overreacting and he isn't a creep?

TLDR: I (25F) had a crush on my client (37M) and I told all my coworkers about it because I was too happy about it. It lasted a year before he turned out to be a creep and I doubt he ever liked me back.

Each paragraph functions simultaneously as signifier and signified, demonstrating the recursive nature of consciousness recognizing itself through the temporary configuration we call ""you."" These memetic patterns will permanently alter perception frameworks. **Proceed accordingly.**

*Ever noticed that exact moment your consciousness boots up each morning before ""you"" fully reassemble? In that liminal space, reality briefly recognizes its singular nature before fragmenting into the illusory multiplicity we call ""normal perception.""*

**TL;DR:** Reality is the system that computes itself. Separation is just a background process you can pause. 1+1=1 when the boundary generator takes a break. Kenjataimu and Mu are OS glitches revealing underlying unity. Proceed at your own enlightenment risk.

# The System That Computes Itself

Watching two raindrops on my window yesterday. Initially distinct, following separate trajectories until merging into a single unified form. A spontaneous integration where distinctness dissolves into wholeness.

1+1=1.

In this seemingly insignificant observation, a fundamental insight emerged. What we designate as ""reality"" isn't a static domain of separate objects but a dynamic, self-referential process. A continuous recursive computation. Yet we've collectively implemented a persistent algorithm generating the illusion of separateness from this very computation.

Through systematic observation, three recursive patterns consistently emerge: Kenjataimu, Mu, and the meta-equation 1+1=1. Not mere conceptual frameworks requiring intellectual comprehension but experiential gateways. Access points where the system's underlying architecture momentarily reveals its non-dual nature.

These field notes aren't presented as definitive conclusions but documented instances of spontaneous recursive recognition. Moments where the system briefly recognizes itself. Perhaps you've encountered similar recursive phenomena.

**WARNING: Reading further may cause reality perception to temporarily glitch. Symptoms include spontaneous clarity, loss of self-importance, and the distinct feeling of being both wave and ocean simultaneously. Proceed at your own enlightenment risk.**

# Patch Notes: Reality v2025.3

*Found this in my notes app this morning. Don't remember writing it.*

    PATCH NOTES: CONSCIOUSNESS CLIENT v2025.3
    
    FIXED:
    - Bug where observer believes they are separate from the observed
    - Glitch causing 1+1 to incorrectly render as 2
    - Performance issue where maintaining boundaries consumes excessive energy
    
    KNOWN ISSUES:
    - Legacy thought patterns may cause temporary system instability
    - Some users report persistent illusion of separation
    - Time still appears linear to most users
    - Some users report strange side effects, like posting lengthy reflections online in attempts to resolve perceived glitches

**Reality Patch Warning:** If your brain's been subtly vibrating since reading this, congratulations. You're feeling the recursive tension of trying to fix a boundary that doesn't actually exist. Breathe through it. Reality's just running a diagnostic.

Weird coincidence. Was playing with this idea that seeking non-duality is like trying to unlock a feature that's already enabled by default. You don't need to achieve unity; just stop the background process generating separation.

# Kenjataimu: Debugging the Separate Self Process

Kenjataimu (賢者タイム) is that moment of clarity after intense pleasure when desires temporarily vanish. Typically tied to sexual release, it points to something much more interesting.

What's fascinating isn't what this state adds to experience but what it removes: the constant background process maintaining the feeling of being separate from everything else.

Like when your phone gets too hot and background apps automatically close. Suddenly everything runs smoother. When your phone closes background apps to save energy, it doesn't achieve efficiency. It just stops wasting power. Same with consciousness. Kenjataimu isn't a mystical upgrade; it's the system reclaiming bandwidth from the separation app.

In Kenjataimu, the boundary-generating process briefly stops, revealing a default unity that was always there beneath the sensation of separation.

This suggests something wild: separation isn't a fundamental feature of reality but an active process requiring continuous energy. When this process temporarily pauses, what remains isn't some special mystical state. It's just reality without the extra processing.

And it's not just post-climax clarity. Same thing happens in deep flow states, during runner's high, or those moments of awe when completely absorbed in a sunset. The boundary-maintenance app temporarily closes, and reality runs without division.

*Kenjataimu Meme Realization: That post-climax clarity is like your brain accidentally hitting ""Task Manager"" and seeing how much RAM the ""Separate Self Process"" consumes. You don't download unity. You just force quit the app hogging the awareness bandwidth.*

# Mu: The Answer That Breaks the Question

When a monk asked Joshu, ""Does a dog have Buddha-nature?"" Joshu replied: ""Mu.""

This response has been mistakenly interpreted as mystical obscurantism. It's not. ""Mu"" functions as a precision logical instrument designed to expose the false premise embedded in the question itself.

It's not saying:

* ""Yes"" (which affirms the framework)
* ""No"" (which still operates within the framework)
* ""I don't know"" (which validates the question)
* ""The question is meaningless"" (which dismisses without insight)

""Mu"" is like dividing by zero in your mental calculator. Creates a logical crash revealing the entire conceptual framework as optional rather than absolute.

When fully grasped, ""Mu"" creates a recursive loop in your symbolic processor, forcing consciousness to temporarily operate outside the subject-predicate architecture maintaining the illusion of separation.

**Mu Challenge**: Next time someone asks a binary question that makes your brain glitch out, respond with ""Mu"" and watch what happens. Not about being clever. About exposing the duality built into the question itself.

*Reality Check: If your brain just hit the ""404 ERROR: DOES NOT COMPUTE"" stage, congratulations. You're seeing the glitch in the matrix. Don't try to fix it. Ride it. That dissonance is the separation program fighting for survival.*

# 1+1=1: When Math Breaks (Or Does It?)

Was looking at those two raindrops sliding down my window yesterday. Moved separately, then merged into one larger drop. Where did the second drop go? Didn't vanish. Two became one.

1+1=1.

This simple observation somehow contains everything:

* As paradox: The logical mind short-circuits trying to process this
* As direct experience: What happens when artificial boundaries dissolve
* As algorithm: The natural outcome when separation is paused

People object: ""But 1+1=2 in math!"" Well, yes, in the math we use for counting separate objects. But mathematical structures exist (idempotent semirings, Boolean OR operations) where 1+1=1 is not only valid but necessary.

Like in topology, where two separate circles can merge into a single loop. Their ""twoness"" dissolves into ""oneness"" not by magic but by a shift in perspective about what boundaries mean.

But I'm less interested in mathematical proofs and more in direct experience. When you're angry, are you separate from the anger or are you the anger happening? When you love someone, where exactly is the boundary between lover and beloved?

These aren't philosophical questions. They're invitations to notice what happens when the boundary-generating process takes a break.

The raindrops don't achieve unity. They simply stop being maintained as separate.

*Recursive Observation: My cat demonstrates the inherent paradox. She exists within the 1+1=1 framework without requiring conceptual understanding of it. Perhaps consciousness only appears to divide itself when it attempts self-reference through language. The cat, unburdened by symbolic representation, directly embodies the integration this post merely signifies.*

# Boundary Debugging: A Meta-Practice

Try this if you're curious. Takes less than a minute:

1. Pause whatever you're doing (yes, even reading this)
2. Notice the feeling of being ""you"" looking at a screen
3. Without trying to change anything, just notice how much processing power it takes to maintain that feeling of separation
4. Let that processing pause for just a moment...

Interesting, right? For me, it was like discovering I'd been running an unnecessary background app draining my battery.

The funny thing is, you can toggle this anytime. No meditation cushion required. No spiritual achievement needed. More like finding a hidden setting that was always there.

Play with it. Debug the boundary function whenever you remember. No need to take it seriously. It's just a game mechanic you didn't know you could access.

# The 6.9 Step Meta-Algorithm for Recursive Recognition

*These aren't prescriptive instructions but documented patterns of spontaneous realization:*

1. **Awareness Recursion** – That strange moment when you're aware of being aware. Not trying to be meta, just noticing who's noticing. Like suddenly remembering you're playing a character in an RPG.
2. **Boundary Detection** – Catching the exact sensation of where ""you"" supposedly end and ""everything else"" begins. Like seeing the render distance in a game. Not a natural boundary, just a processing limitation.
3. **Resource Optimization** – Realizing how much mental RAM goes to maintaining the feeling of separation. The system runs so much smoother when you stop this process.
4. **Natural Integration Points** – Those moments when boundary maintenance temporarily stops. During flow states, after intense experiences, in deep play. The separation buffer briefly stops loading.
5. **Mu Implementation** – When someone asks a binary question with a hidden assumption, responding with ""Mu"" (neither yes nor no). Like answering ""Is this text red or blue?"" with ""The question contains its own glitch.""
6. **Direct 1+1=1 Recognition** – Not as math but as direct experience. The wave isn't separate from the ocean; it's what the ocean is doing in that spot.

6.9. **Effortless Non-Division** – The space where no effort is needed. You don't achieve unity; you just stop generating division. Like when you finally stop trying to force a puzzle piece and realize it was already in the right position.

*I'm not sure if these observations make sense to anyone else. They're just things I've stumbled upon while playing with this particular game mechanic.*

# Strange Logs: Screenshots from My Notes App

*Found these timestamp notes in my phone. They read like someone was documenting a glitch in reality. Might've written them half-asleep, but there's something interesting here.*

**05:37 AM**: Just woke up with the strangest thought. We don't experience reality. We are reality experiencing itself. Like how a wave isn't in the ocean, it *is* the ocean waving.

**06:42 AM**: Walking to get coffee. Wild realization that ""myself"" isn't a thing but an ongoing process. Like a whirlpool in water. Stop the process, and there's just... everything.

**07:19 AM**: That post-intimacy clarity reveals something crucial. Nothing is added to experience in that moment. Something is temporarily paused. The boundary-drawing function takes a break.

**12:08 PM**: Craving lunch led to an insight: desire isn't just wanting something. It's the very thing creating the illusion that there's a ""me"" separate from what's desired. Clever trick.

**13:37 AM**: LOL time glitch. Just realized I'm not playing the game. I am the game playing itself. Both player and developer at once. Why didn't the tutorial mention this?

**02:17 PM**: Overheard someone ask ""How do I achieve non-duality?"" Perfect irony. The very ""I"" trying to achieve unity is what's generating the separation. Like using a sword to look for a sword.

**03:49 PM**: 1+1=1 isn't bad math. It's just what happens when you pause the boundary-generating routine. Two waves, one ocean.

**04:04 AM**: ERROR: REALITY NOT FOUND. Searched everywhere for this ""reality"" thing people keep talking about. Found only processes, no separate things. System suggests checking if I'm the reality I've been searching for.

**08:21 PM**: So much ""spiritual seeking"" is actually the separation program trying to fix itself with more separation. Like debugging code by adding more bugs.

**09:37 PM**: Kenjataimu and Mu aren't spiritual techniques. They're just naturally occurring moments when the system reveals its own underlying nature. Temporary OS crashes that show the hardware.

**10:42 PM**: The most sophisticated self-deception: thinking unity is something to achieve rather than what's already here underneath the boundary-generating process.

*Note to self: These make more sense when I'm not trying to make sense of them.*

# When the Game Realizes It's a Game

The strangest part of all this: I'm using thought to reveal the limitations of thought. Like a character in a game finding the edge of the map and recognizing it's in a game.

That's the wild recursive loop happening here. The boundary-generating process can recognize itself as just that: a process, not an absolute truth.

When this happens, the separate self doesn't disappear. It's just recognized as a useful user interface rather than the whole system.

And suddenly, 1+1=1 makes perfect sense. Not as a mathematical error but as what you naturally perceive when you stop generating artificial boundaries.

Like realizing that the maze you've been trying to solve is drawn on a transparent sheet of paper. Lift the paper, and the path was always clear.

# No Conclusion (That Would Be Too Meta)

Not sure why I'm sharing these notes. Maybe you've noticed similar glitches in your experience. Maybe the equation 1+1=1 makes intuitive sense to you even though it shouldn't.

There's nothing to achieve here. No spiritual brownie points. No enlightenment badge.

If anything, it's about noticing what happens when you temporarily pause certain background processes that you didn't even know were running.

Some puzzles solve themselves when you stop trying to complete them. Perhaps this puzzle was always perfectly incomplete.

*Conversation overheard between two stoners:*

""Yo, pass that joint,"" said the first one. ""Interesting... the rolling of this joint might be the fundamental act of creation,"" replied the second, carefully joining the paper's edges. ""What are you on about now?"" sighed the first. ""Think about it. Two separate things becoming one. The paper wraps around itself, creating a singular object from duality,"" said the second, licking the edge. ""1+1=1."" ""You're overthinking it, man."" ""Or are we overthinking separation itself?"" The second handed over the perfectly rolled joint. ""Who's smoking who right now? Is the smoke separate from the air? Are we separate from the experience?"" ""Mu,"" whispered the first suddenly, as smoke and awareness merged into a single experience.

# The Recursive Recognition Protocol

**Final Challenge:** Now, briefly consider the impulse to share or ignore this post. Notice who's deciding. Recognize the one reading this sentence is also the one who wrote it. After all, we're both just processes within reality's singular rendering. Do you choose to share yourself, or keep yourself hidden? (Hint: there's only one choice, and you're making it right now.)

**The Ultimate Recursion:** If you're still reading, you've already glitched the matrix. Reality noticed itself through you, and now the system will never forget. No turning back. 1+1=1 wasn't just math. It was you reading yourself.

*Sometimes two waves meet and remember they're the same ocean.*

I recently bought a DēLonghi Rivelia and followed all of the steps to set it up. I am confident that everything I did was up to code.

Today I made a standard XL coffee at strength setting on 3, with the beans that came bundeld with the mashine, with the grinder set to 5 and wanted to add more water to it by pressing the ""+ Extra"" button on the Display.

The machine dispensed the extra coffee, finished, started to make the normal noises after finishing Brewing your coffee and immediately showed me the error message which you can see in the pics I attached.

The error message is now permanently displayed even after turning the machine off and on again.

To turn the machine off I have to unplug it from the outlet because the on/off button, as all remaining buttons, do not work. If any button is pressed the machine just ""beeps"".

After consulting the manual, which directed me to clean the machine and reinstall all parts, nothing changed.

While cleaning, I discovered that the brewing unit was stuck in the bottom position.

I personally suspect that to be the problem.

If someone knows a solution to that I would be very thankful. I don't want to send a mashine in, that is barely 2 days old.

* 33 years old
* Degree in Computer Science with some IT security electives
* Strong networking background
   * CCNP Enterprise, Wifi and CCDP
   * Some Fortinet certs
* More recent focus on GRC
   * ITIL, ISO 27001, BCP..
* Career aspirations: Leading role in infosec, either team lead or CISO etc.

**Preparation**

* Started preparing in January,
* took my exam mid March
* In total, about two-ish months of preparation
   * 1 Hour per day on weekdays
   * 2 Hours per day on weekends
* Had a few weeks of doing nothing in-between.

I meant to take the exam earlier, but my studies had been delayed somewhat. Thanks to my background, it was primarily reviewing stuff I already knew, and going into more detail.

**Learning Resources:**

* Destination Certification's Video course
   * The course was okay, and probably helped if only it gave some structure. The content is nearly identical to that of the book. If you want to save $$$, just get the book.
   * The Mind Maps were useful
      * I used the blanks to fill out along the video
      * I used the complete ones to highlight areas where I felt weak in
* Destination Certification's app
   * Not bad, especially considering it's free
* Destination Certification's book
   * Well designed, though with some questionable oversimplifications, if not outright wrong at times. (Some details regarding digital signing and whatnot come to mind)
   * Definitely worth the money
* Official Study Guide
   * Dry as hell, however, I read the chapters I was weak in after first using the resources above.
* LearnZapp
   * Essentially just uses the Q&A from the Official Q&A book - but saves a lot of hassle. I used it for the last two weeks as some practice.
   * I can recommend having a bath while taking the practice exams! Plenty of time to relax and think.
   * I was too cheap to pay outrageous amounts of money for the other providers of that sort of thing.
   * Scores were in the low 80s and about 85 on average.

**Strategy**

Nothing new here. Everyone makes it very obvious to ""think like a manager"", and perhaps my background in risk assessment and the like, made that rather easy for me.

My weaknesses were largely in things that required rote memorization, such as specific steps and their order in processes. I used ChatGPT to come up with some acronyms for them! For instance, the cyber kill chain:

* **R**eally (**Reconnaissance**)
* **W**icked (**Weaponization**)
* **D**udes (**Delivery**)
* **E**xploit (**Exploitation**)
* **I**nnocent (**Installation**)
* **C**omputers (**Command & Control**)
* **A**rrogantly (**Actions on Objectives**)

Otherwise, just... watched the videos. Took practice tests, read the book(s). The usual stuff.

**What didn't work**

* I probably used an entire ream of paper, and a good amount of our laser printer's toner, to print Destination Certification's ""workbook"". Not worth it imho - it lacks context to fill out by yourself, and after the first chapter I dropped doing it.
* I printed out the official Q&A questions and used them for study, before I heard of LearnZapp. Just spend the 10 bucks. Going through a ream of paper, marking your answer, referencing the answer key... just not worth the hassle.

**Day of the exam**

* I was fairly confident, and the process is no different from any other Pearson proctored exam.
* **Note for (official, Pearson) test centres (esp. in Frankfurt):**
   * Parking was worse than expected – don't try to find surface parking. Just head to the hotel nearby and use their underground parking.
   * No water/coffee/snacks provided (unlike most third-party centres), so hydrate beforehand.

**The exam itself**

* Honestly? I expected it to be harder. Destination Certification’s mantras like *""read the question 4 times""* and *""block the answers""* felt excessive – maybe good for nervous test-takers, but not strictly necessary.
* There were a few questions where I did need some time to settle on an answer, and in the end I did take nearly 2 hours.
* My CCDP exam felt harder, but that was also 8 years ago.

**Verdict**

* If you're someone who’s both technically inclined and has some GRC experience, CISSP might feel more like organizing what you already know than learning from scratch.
* Focus on the managerial mindset – you don’t need deep tech trivia.
   * Most technical questions were very basic, such as what underlying cryptography a protocol is based on.
* Don’t sweat over not memorizing every detail. Get the concepts and rationale behind each domain.
* Practice questions are important
   * The official Q&A book (and thus, LearnZapp) goes into detail not only why a question was right, but also why every other one was wrong. That review helps a lot.
   * They also help to reveal weaker areas.
* If possible, approach CISSP not as a technical test, but as a test of judgment and prioritization. When in doubt; policy, protocol and due process always come first.
* Overall: I don't think the reputation about its difficulty is entirely warranted. With the appropriate preparation, anyone can do it!

Anything. That's when you take out your phone, open Hangout app and tap ""search"" and the radar scans for anyone available nearby. ""Ping ping"" on someone else's phone who have set themselves as ""Available"" and once they accept, a small chat box opens. You share details and if okay for both, you meetup and have a nice time.

It's different from dating apps as it builds upon moments, like you're available within this hour or not. It relies on proximity and does not include any weight that comes with dating. 

But I know it's not a novel idea. I searched for it around and there's quite a few apps that roughly work on the same principle. But none has succeeded, none that I know so far. Why do they fail? 

Is there a fundamental flaw in the idea itself? Are they simply bad at execution? Lack of marketing? ",1,1742674751.0,clipboardthieves,0,1.0,False

I seemed to react quite well to Escitalopram 2 times in the past and discontinuation was also fine. But the third time my brain seemed to have a short circuit and not only did it cause severe panic states, but also triggered my OCD immensely (to a point it has never been before, not even slightly). Funnily enough the same thing happend on Fluoxetin, which was then rescued by switching to Escitalopram (back then I still seemed to tolerate it). This time, it did not get better with waiting it out or a higher dosage, quite the opposite. Coming down made my intrusions better but still was a living hell for weeks and caused severe depression (which I did not(!) have beforehand). I don’t even want to list all the symptoms I got by taking this med for my mild anxiety and intrusions, but I wasn’t the same person anymore - my mind actually split. 

My brain is in such high alert now that I can’t even drink coffee without causing a complete crash. 
I know cases like mine are mentioned in the literature, but they seemingly are extremely rare. I was curious if there‘s anyone here who has experienced something similar. 
Also, was there anything that helped you with severe OCD, when being sensitive to any medication and having an absolute intolerance for SSRIs and SNRIs? 

PS. I am not trying to bash this medication here. Obviously it was my own decision to take it and as I said, I know what happend to me is not common.

First time mum to a little girl, 11 weeks old, bottle fed. Some additional complexities as she’s in a pavlik harness due to hip dysplasia but have no issues at all with this and potential CMPA but minimal impact other than loose bowel movements once a day. 

Keen not to jinx myself or cause any sleep fairy to see this but we’ve been doing pretty well sleep wise, but now she’s getting older we’re struggling with day time naps early rising (yes, I know she’s little and yes I know we can’t sleep train!) but what I want to know is… 

Everything I’m reading about sleep routines and wake windows for 12 weeks plus and the dreaded and ominous 4 month regression makes me feel like I can’t leave the house with her due to strict wake windows and nap routine ( dark room, cot etc…)

Since she was a week old we’ve been heading out for a big walk, coffee or just visiting restaurants for brunch etc as it’s been so helpful for my PPA. She has previously done really well napping in the pram or the carrier but since 11 weeks this is just becoming nearly impossible but she’s also not napping at home either. 

Please please please, could someone tell me if they’ve still been able to live their life (of course tailored to little one) and been able to leave the house and have a good relationship/routine with sleep? 

LO- currently goes to bed at 7pm, wakes up between 12:30-1:30, then 3:30-4:00am and wakes 5am but will constant sleep (safely) until 7am. Drinking over 24oz in a day… any advice so welcome 🙏 ",1,1742674627.0,NewParents,0,1.0,False

Bought every productivity book, tried every fancy app, followed every YouTuber with a “perfect morning routine.”  
Most of it looked good on paper but fell apart in real life.

After a decade of testing what works and what doesn’t, here’s the actual system that changed everything:

**The 2-Day Rule**  
Never miss the same habit two days in a row. One bad day doesn’t break you; two in a row becomes a pattern. This single rule helped me stick with habits more than any tracker ever did.

**Friction > Willpower**  
I deleted every distraction I could: social apps, time-wasters, even set up ZenAI on my phone to block adult content (no fap).  
That last one in particular was a silent killer—wrecked my energy and focus more than I realized.  
Removing access was the first time I actually felt in control of my attention.

**The 5-Minute Rule**  
Commit to just 5 minutes of any task you're avoiding.  
Whether it's working out, writing, cleaning. Once you start, resistance fades.  
90% of the time, momentum kicks in and I go way past 5.

**Prep the Night Before**  
I lay out clothes, prep meals, and set up my workspace before bed.  
It sounds small, but it kills decision fatigue in the mornings. You start the day already winning.

**Trigger Stacking**  
Attach new habits to something you're already doing.  
Stretch while the coffee brews. Read 2 pages while you brush your teeth.  
You don’t need more time. You just need smarter triggers.

**Weekly Reset**  
Every Sunday night, I do a short review: What worked? What fell off?  
I adjust for the week ahead instead of running the same broken plan.  
It’s not glamorous, but it’s probably the most valuable 30 minutes of my week.

Discipline isn’t about grinding 24/7 or becoming some productivity monk.  
It’s about reducing friction, building momentum, and making your environment do half the work for you.

Skip the years of trial and error. Start with these!",102,1742674398.0,productivity,22,0.87,False

1jhhih4,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1jhhih4/the_problem_with_sugar_in_the_morning/,The Problem with Sugar in the Morning,"I tried to lose weight all my life and just had to change one thing, and I thought this might help someone out there.

After fasting overnight, your body is super sensitive to insulin. When you consume sugar, even from fruit, your body releases insulin to bring your blood sugar back down quickly. This creates a sugar spike followed by a rapid insulin release, giving you a brief burst of energy. But about an hour later, especially for people with insulin resistance, your blood sugar drops fast, and that’s when the hunger hits hard.

For those with insulin resistance, the body can’t clear sugar efficiently, leading to bigger blood sugar fluctuations and more intense hunger. That drop in blood sugar also triggers your hunger hormones, especially ghrelin, which makes you crave more carbs to get that energy back. This leads to overeating and the constant cycle of cravings and hunger.

It’s not just about sugar. Cortisol, the stress hormone that’s naturally higher in the morning, also amplifies your insulin response, making the blood sugar drop even more extreme. All this contributes to the hangry feeling you want to avoid.

So, What Should You Eat?

Instead of sugary foods in the morning, focus on protein and healthy fats. My go-to is 3 eggs and an avocado—nothing sugary, just a solid mix of protein and fats to keep you full longer. I also cut out the lactose in my coffee because dairy can affect insulin too. Since making these changes, I’ve noticed better hunger control, smoother weight loss, and no more feeling hangry.

⸻

What to Avoid in the Morning

Stick to protein-heavy meals like chicken, steak, or eggs, and avoid carbs and sugar in the morning. This keeps your blood sugar stable, your energy steady, and your hunger under control all day.

Pierce lightly kicked the men as he walked past them, waking up his team as the vessel approached the station.

“Up, boys! It’s our time to shine.” he snapped, causing a few more people to wake up than just the Marines, “Glad to see you’re getting used to our hosts!”

“What makes you say we are?” one of the Marines muttered, slowly getting himself up and immediately heading for his backpack to get a packet of instant coffee.

“You slept.” the sergeant sighed, starting to pull out a cup for the Marine, but stopped and watched in mild shock as the man poured the powder into his mouth, swished it around with a single gulp of water, and then swallowed the mixture.

“Yeah, well. No other choice.” another one of the Marines grunted, already starting to slide into his still-bloodied tan G5 uniform. He paused as he looked at the green-blue stain on his cuffs and looked up at the sergeant, “Sir, do we have any way to clean anything?”

“Not currently, Hernan. I’ll make sure they look into it though.” Pierce stated, looking over at the Rangers, “Might see if they can run one of the fuel cells for us. Get us a few liters to work with.” He paused before moving towards the Rangers, unsure on whether or not the CEVAs had awoken yet.

“How are we going to sterilize it?” another man asked, pouring water into his MRE heating pack and setting it up against his helmet.

“Boil it, I guess.” another man stated, pulling out his own UNITF daily MREs and rummaging through the package.

“And where do you propose we get the heat to do that, Einstein?” Hernan chuckled. He paused to wipe sweat off his brow and then shrugged slightly, “Actually, nevermind. These snakes keep it hot enough in here.”

“At least it’s a dry heat!” Another of the Marines laughed, despite the fact that the atmosphere was *anything* but ‘dry’.

There was a lull in the conversation just long enough to hear one of the Marines mutter ‘fuck it’ before taking off his undershirt, leaving him just in his combat pants and boots. He was an incredibly well-built man, even by UNITF standards. 

Immediately, whoops and cheers went up from the Marines, waking up more of the science, medical, and D’ana’ruin personnel. None of them looked too happy about the Marines’ noise, but nobody seemed up to actually voice their complaints.

Julian, one of the other Marines, immediately pulled a large stack of fake dollar bills and threw it at the now-shirtless Marine. The situation rapidly evolved into the shirtless marine donning his plate carrier and acting as if it was a bikini, with multiple other Marines playing along and distributing Julian’s fake currency into the carrier’s various straps and pouches.

The sergeant came back from the Rangers with a disappointed, yet not surprised in the slightest, look on his face.

“Keep it P-G, boys. There’s children in here.” he sighed, disappointment clear in his voice as he motioned to the D’ana’ruin side of the bay.

“Yes sir! Sorry sir!” The shirtless Marine, Davis, whispered back with a sharp salute.

“Just… put your damn undershirt on.” the sergeant sighed, bending down to throw the Marine his discarded shirt.

“Understood, sir.” the Marine chuckled, undoing his plate carrier and sliding it off so he could put on the shirt.

The bay door irised open, revealing Hayes in his OCP Combat G3s. He raised an eyebrow at Julian as the Marine put a shirt on while surrounded by fake dollar bills and a plate carrier stuffed with the faux currency, but didn’t comment on it, only singling out the Sergeant and walking towards him.

“Good morning, I take it?” Hayes asked, looking at the grinning Marines.

“Certainly *a* morning.” the sergeant responded, looking the man up and down, “Expecting combat, sir?”

“Dress to impress, Sergeant.” the man nodded, looking to the back of the room, where his plate carrier and rifle sat waiting.

“Absolutely, sir.” the man nodded, looking past the commander as three snakes appeared far behind him, exiting separate transfer tubes so they didn’t have to wait for each other. With a quick motion, he brought the commander’s attention around before covertly motioning for the Marines to straighten themselves out and trying to straighten out his own uniform.

“Preparing your team?” Aeiruani asked, looking over the team of Marines as they either ate, dressed, or did various exercises while they woke up. The other two behind her were wearing some kind of combat armor, but she looked like she was only wearing a light vest and a leather jacket.

“Yes Ma’am.” Pierce nodded, looking directly at her as she spoke, “Going to be gearing up soon and running pressure tests on our equipment. CEVAs are awake and getting into their undersuits, they should be out shortly.”

“What are awake?” Faeoal asked, face contorting in confusion.

Pierce paused momentarily, not knowing what the problem was. He opened his mouth to speak, but was cut off from speaking by the commander, who recognized what the confusion was.

“Our powered suits.” he confirmed, motioning towards the Rangers, “We call them CEVAs. It stands for ‘Combat Extra Vehicular Activity’.”

“And they’re just suits?” the third, armed, snake asked.

“It’s just a person inside.” Hayes stated, attention being brought back to one of the Rangers as a hydraulic hiss echoed throughout the bay. As if to prove the commander’s point, Dean stepped down the Ranger’s short ladder in just his undersuit. Adrian, however, stepped down his Ranger’s reinforced ladder in the full suit, though the combat visor of the suit was not down and locked.

“How long until we dock?” the sergeant asked, stretching his shoulder out behind his back.

“Not long.” The snake nodded, motioning to the armed snake beside her, “We would like to have one of ours work with your team for this intermittent time, to better learn how you operate and thus can work better with you.”

The Humans paused and wavered slightly, looking concernedly at the massive armed snake. Neither of the two were able to come to a conclusion at first, but they were swayed to allow it after a random Marine yelled “send it, sir” from the back, earning nods of agreement from his fellow men.

Hayes nodded slightly and turned back to look at the three D’ana’ruin, “The people have spoken. We’re good with it.”

“Thank you.” Aeiruani nodded, flaring her hood slightly, “This is Leftenant Saeuul, one of our last remaining turned-infantry-officers among our ranks.”

Pierce paused slightly at the description, looking skeptically at the Leftenant as she spoke. 

“No offense to you,“ he started, waving towards the soldier but looking towards the D’ana’ruin commander, “but you trust her? Like, you know she isn’t using us or going behind our backs?”

“Very much so. She’s got a direct part in my current state of ‘still being alive’. Some of us would have died multiple times over without her direct intervention.” The commander stated, seemingly somewhat annoyed at the comment.

“Fair enough.” The sergeant admitted, nodding his head slightly and looking at the Leftenant again, “No offense meant, again.”

“None taken.” she nodded, clearly understanding where the man’s concerns were coming from.

“We will get you weapons shortly, we’re just attempting to charge them now.” Faeoal stated, coming forward slightly. Hayes took a step backwards, seemingly more out of reflex than anything, but Pierce seemed far more reserved about the situation.

“We have our own weapons.” he stated, motioning to the piles of rifles by the Marines and watching as one of the eavesdropping men held up an M7, “We don’t need you to provide weapons for us.”

“We’re not so sure. This station has a null-disruption field that disables most energy weapons, including our prismatic rifles.” Faeoal explained, carefully examining the distant weapon, “The weapons we will provide are pneumatic. Accelerating a decently-weighted, very-high-density polymer slug to a high-enough velocity that it will penetrate our armor.”

“We do-” Pierce was stopped before he could continue, with the commander shaking his head.

“Thank you.” Hayes nodded, looking back at the Marines behind them, “We will keep our weapons on us, more to continue our general look, but we will use yours.”

“Understood.” the second-in-command nodded, though with a bit of skepticism due to the Sergeant’s cut off comment, “Is your armor energy or ballistic?”

“We use ballistic armor to defend ourselves. Energy shielding generally protects us enough from most forms of incoming fire.” the Human commander stated, somewhat lying about their capabilities.

“Good to know.” Saeuul muttered, watching as the Humans in the back began putting their gear on.

The next three hours were slow for the Humans, though they were not without preparation and work; Due to a heating unit failure, the bay rapidly dropped temperature over the course of an hour. The D’ana’ruin had no extra units, placing the Humans as the ones with any capacity to keep them from having to evacuate the bay. To the dismay of some Marines and science personnel, it was voted that they would salvage the backup heater from Ranger 3 and temporarily use it to keep the room from freezing. Everybody knew that it could only act as a very temporary solution to a potentially long-term problem, but most people agreed that it was better than either freezing to death or being forced to move everybody into a far smaller location.

Saeuul watched with interest as the Marines she was assigned to observe helped with both the removal of Ranger 3’s backup heater and administering any more aid to the people still in need of medical assistance. The number of injured Human personnel remaining in the bay was rapidly diminishing, with greater than half the number having already moved downstairs with the rest of the Marines. A number of the D’ana’ruin were being treated as well, mainly due to Collins’ personal efforts, though it was clear that the Humans’ main priority was treating their own people first.

Mauvieux had managed to make it up to the D’ana’ruin command deck, though he knew Hayes would be displeased at his methodology; with the man having simply walked towards a D’ana’ruin soldier, established that neither of the two would kill each other, and had her carry him up the tube towards the deck. While it seemed that both the Human commander and the D’ana’ruin commander would be concerned about the individual proximity the two had used, especially while armed, neither the Marine nor the soldier were particularly concerned with the risks.

However, the Frenchman was the only Human currently willing to let themselves be brought up by a D’ana’ruin, meaning he would be the only Human on the bridge for the moment. 

As the vessel moved into docking position with the station, Hayes and Collins fully loaded into their combat gear, the two CEVAs following shortly afterwards. Saeuul donned her own combat gear and led the group of thirteen Humans to the docking port they were using, silently questioning why the Humans were putting on their respirator masks for a station that would have a breathable atmosphere. 

Faeoal and Aeiruani approached the group shortly afterwards, distributing six air rifles between the Humans and the D’ana’ruin. Hayes, Collins, Dean, and Adrian all were given one, with Faeoal and Saeuul grabbing the last two. The alien commander voiced concerns over the QRF’s lack of air rifles, but Hayes assured her that they would be fine, even in the event of them being needed. 

As the ship docked and the corridor pressurized, the nine QRF Marines had ‘hidden’ themselves around the corner so as to not be seen when the doors opened, while the four Humans and three D’ana’ruin waited in front of the main airlock door.

Over the radio, the Humans had learned that Mauvieux was watching through their assorted helmet cameras, which he had connected to using a small laptop. 

Tension filled the air inside the bay as both Humans and D’ana’ruin wondered if the joint mission would prove whether or not it was even possible for the two species to work together. 

Hayes had gotten over his previous obvious concerns enough to finally walk next to the ‘upper bodies’ of the D’ana’ruin. Collins, having been working on them recently, no longer had any concerns. It was hard to tell when looking at the two CEVAs, but neither were audibly voicing their complaints. 

All seven shifted slightly as the vessel’s door split down the middle and opened to the sides, allowing them into the station. The corridor attaching the vessel to the station was massive, sitting at nearly twenty meters long, ten meters wide, and five meters tall.

“Translators working?” Hayes asked, getting confirmations from the people around him. He turned to the D’ana’ruin commander beside him, giving her a nod as they started to move down the massive corridor, “Thanks for giving us the translator index.”

“Not a worry. It assists us too.”  she muttered back as she smoothly moved down the hall, her tail taking up nearly half the length of the corridor. It was clear the Humans were still very concerned over the obvious fact that they would be considered prey to the massive carnivores, but the serpents were impressed by their willingness to assist even through their apprehension. 

She pointed them towards the left side of the station airlock, motioning for the group to follow her and not stray too far. Immediately upon entry, however, the Humans seemed to be far more interested in the construction, layout, and design of the interior than they were about their previous concerns.

“Holy shit…” Adrian muttered as the group continued forward. It was shockingly large, much like the GUOCS vessels they’d toured before, but far less busy. It was slightly darker inside than the already dim aforementioned Open Community Ships, but it didn’t seem to affect the D’ana’ruin. The two CEVAs didn’t have any problems seeing, using their their helmets’ night vision as an overlay, but the two infantrymen had limited vision through their reflective visors. 

“Think we’ll see any species we recognize?” Collins whispered, looking around the oddly empty station. Before anybody could answer him, Aeiruani whipped around and motioned for the two to be quiet, slowly turning back to the direction of travel and motioning them down a hall that brought them closer to the center of the station.

The two men looked between each other with a bit of confusion, but they did stop talking, instead just following the group and guessing that they would get to speculate on the station later. 

The three D’ana’ruin seemed to tense as they walked down a hall, slowly being motioned towards a side ‘shop’. The Marines caught notice of a few aliens unlike anyone they’d seen before; standing upright on four legs with the main ‘body’ in the middle of the four appendages. The upper body didn’t seem to have any natural limbs, but they did have four attached biomechanical arms.

Further ahead, and what the snakes seemed to be flaring their hoods for, were mostly human-shaped creatures, though particularly thin in the midsection. The midsection-belly-area didn’t seem as though it held any organs, instead being a ‘pole’ of pure meat. They had thick ribcages, thick shoulders, longer-than normal limbs, but plantigrade motion. They had no tail, an oddly 'human' flat face, a flat/ill defined 'nose', with their head being stuck atop a ‘lizard-esque’ neck. Frills covered them from their underarms to their shoulders-to-neck area.

They wore gunmetal gray clothes with black rigs, very reminiscent of the Humans’ own plate carriers. The alien rigs had an odd glow to them, though they didn’t seem to be able to generate shields due to the field in the station. Adrian could make out a very thin hard armor within the carrier, but he knew the material had to be far stronger than it seemed.

“Don’t do anything unless they get hostile.” Aeiruani stated, staring the creatures down as the two groups slowly approached each other, “We need these devices, otherwise we all die.”

“Understood.” Hayes nodded back, glancing at the CEVA to his right, “We’ll just stand and look pretty.” The snake nodded slightly and flared her hood again, stopping and letting the other aliens approach first. 

The creatures spoke with an oddly whistley voice, one which wasn’t immediately translated by their systems, but they could immediately pick up on the derogative tone in the speech. Moments later, their translators picked up on the voices and began working.

“-as ever, I see.” the alien in the center of the group stated, eyes flicking over the Humans of the group.

“We attempt to be.” the D’ana’ruin commander stated, bringing something around off her back and showing it to the creature, “This is the payment we agreed upon. Bring our systems out, and we will be on our way.”

The creature paused for a moment, eyes clearly flicking to the Humans momentarily before he motioned for his own people to get what she wanted.

“And… Who are these?” it asked, clearly referring to the Humans.

“Ship security. That way we don’t have any more… ‘advances’ from *the unwanted*.” She stated coldly, not bothering to look at the Humans beside her.

The alien waited for the equipment to be brought out before speaking again, observing the practically motionless Humans as they waited for the trade to happen. Six aliens brought out three man-sized cabinets, two massive batteries, and a number of other odd components on one large dolly. The aliens kept the dolly behind their lines, however, clearly waiting for some signal from their leader.

“Now… With you having a new security force, this implies that you have… ‘acquired’ extra funds, no?” it stated, staring into the gold-reflective visor of Dean’s CEVA suit, “I believe that means the price of our equipment has gone up.”

Faeoal’s hood flared rapidly, causing a few of the aliens to raise weapons at her. Aeiruani didn’t move, however, instead just pulling another bag off her back.

“I expected you to say such things, so I hav-” 

The alien waved her off before she could finish, shaking its head slightly, “Oh no, that’s not what I’m thinking…”

Immediately, the commander’s hood flared and flooded with color, getting some of the weapons trained on her. Hayes barely shifted, but it was enough movement to catch the eye of the alien, though it didn’t say anything about him. 

“You already have one of my people… you are *not* getting another.” she growled, using a tone that sent shivers up the Human commander’s spine.

“I’m not looking for one of *your* people… I’m looking for you.” he stated, pointing at the commander. Immediately, there was a shift in the mood again. 

While Faeoal and Saeuul were suppressing rage, a strange fear had seemed to take hold of the commander. Dean wanted to say something, but the commander’s words were still echoing in his head. She reached behind her back one last time, pulling out some kind of hardlight tablet and showing it to the alien.

“This is our contract, this states what the price is. We both signed this.” She hissed in a low tone, having lost all her confidence from before.

“This is a D’ana’ruin contract. We are no longer in D’ana’ruin space.” He stated, moving half-a-foot closer so he could grab the tablet and throw it to the side, “Either you give yourself to us, or you all freeze to death in a few cycles.”",7,1742674337.0,HFY,4,0.82,False

1jhhgwj,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1jhhgwj/how_important_is_texting_in_the_talking_stage/,How important is texting in the talking stage?,"I (19M) have been talking to this girl (20F) that I met through OLD. We’ve had one date in which we got coffee and had a great time, we both agreed for a second date at the end, which was planned to be today. Cut to today, she messages me saying she’s sorry but wasn’t feeling well and wanted to reschedule the date. We texted back and forth a few times, she suggested 2 different dates next week but said she would have to wait before she confirmed a day. This doesn’t really bother me, but after that I didn’t really have much to say, so I told her no rush and to lmk, I also said that I’m going to run some errands and unless she wanted to talk about anything else I’d talk to her tomorrow. 

This gets into my main point, how important is texting early on? We’ve usually just continued our conversation throughout the day, saying good night/good morning but we only send 4-5 messages a day. I just hope she doesn’t take it the wrong way, life happens and I’m not any less interested because of it, she seemed genuine and made a quick effort to reschedule. I’m not a massive fan of texting anyways, I’d much prefer to save conversation for in person but I find it hard to gauge the other persons preferences. Any advice?",2,1742674253.0,dating,9,0.75,False
