1oq9koe,https://www.reddit.com/r/novelsfree/comments/1oq9koe/need_free_link/,Need free link,"By my third year of marriage to Dominic, I had been tormented 99th times by his so-called nemesis, Abrielle.
The first time, Abrielle hit me with her car, leaving me in a week-long ICU coma.
The second time, Abrielle locked me in an abandoned factory’s cold storage, nearly freezing me to death.
On the third attempt, Abrielle stuffed me into a commercial oven.
Each time I begged Dominic to act, he only said softly, “Abby’s just joking. Don’t take it to heart.”
But the ninety‑ninth time, while I was unconscious, she nearly drained all my blood by medical equipment!
I clung to Dominic, tears streaming.“Dom, it’s the 99th time. Please send her to jail before she ki lls me.”
He gently wiped the blood from my cheek and shook his head. “Be understanding, okay? Don’t mind her.”
In that moment, my heart completely broke.
If you can’t bear to part with her, I thought, I’ll leave, and never return.
By the third year of her marriage to Dominic Caldwell, Evelina Jennington had been tormented ninety-nine times by his so-called arch-nemesis, Abrielle Waldron.
The first time it happened, Abrielle hit Evelina with her car. Evelina ended up with broken ribs and internal bleeding, leaving her in a week-long coma in the ICU.
Dominic gathered the world's finest medical team to save her. But when she begged him to take action against Abrielle, he said softly, ""Abby was just joking around. Don't take it to heart, all right?""
The second time, Abrielle locked Evelina in the cold storage of an abandoned factory, nearly freezing her to death.
After Evelina was saved, Dominic held her in his arms all night to keep her warm, but said, ""Abby's just acting out, jealous of how happy we are.""
On her third attempt, Abrielle stuffed Evelina into a commercial oven.
Dominic rescued Evelina in time and kissed her with concern. But he also brushed it off, saying, ""Abby's used to having things her way. I apologize on her behalf.""
On her ninety‑ninth attempt, Abrielle tied Evelina to the bed while she was unconscious.
Then she hooked Evelina up to the medical equipment she'd obtained and almost drained all the blood from Evelina's body!
Outside the operating room, Dominic's voice was devoid of any warmth as he warned the doctors, ""If you lose her, you'll pay with your lives, too!""
Evelina held onto him with all her strength, crying. ""Dom, this is the 99th time already... Please throw her in jail, or I'll eventually die in her hands...""
He wiped the blood off her face and shook his head helplessly.
""Be more understanding, all right? Don't mind her.
""Abby's parents divorced when she was young. She's largely insecure and is always paranoid. Once, she said she only found joy in the process of going against me.
""We even made a business when we were kids: we'd keep fighting each other for life, and neither of us could ever get married.
""But I broke our promise. I fell in love with you at first sight. That's why she went after you.
""Those were just pranks. She never meant to ki ll you—she knew I'd save you.
""For my sake, let this slide, too, okay?""
Evelina's heart was completely shattered.
When she woke up in the hospital the next day, she immediately reached for her phone on the bedside table and called Dominic's father.
Her voice was terrifyingly calm. ""Sir Caldwell, I know you think I'm not good enough for Dominic, and you've been hoping I'd leave him. I'll do it. I'm willing to divorce him and disappear forever.""
On the other end of the line, Calvin Caldwell seemed rather surprised, but he quickly regained his composure. ""Glad that you've finally thought things through. I'll have someone send the divorce papers over right away. Just sign it, and I'll handle everything else. Once the divorce is finalized, leave Dominic and never come back.""
""Okay,"" answered Evelina decisively. She then ended the call.
Not long after, the Caldwell family's butler arrived, handing over the document respectfully. ""Please take a look at the agreement, Mrs. Caldwell.""
Evelina took it, her fingers cold; the document felt impossibly heavy.
Tears blurred her vision, and she couldn't help but think of the first time she'd met Dominic.
Back then, she was just an ordinary TV reporter sent to interview him, a rising star in the business world.
He sat behind the large desk, cold and handsome, exuding a powerful presence. During the interview, he barely spared her a glance.
But after the interview, as she was gathering her things, Dominic suddenly asked, his deep eyes fixed on her, ""May I know your name?""
After that, he pursued her intensely and unreservedly.
He showered her with gifts—flowers, jewelry, even a luxury car—and took her on romantic candlelit dinners...
Due to the vast difference in their status, she repeatedly turned him down. ""Mr. Caldwell, we aren't equals. We are from two different worlds. And you deserve better.""
But he always looked at her with longing, his gaze so intense it made her heart race. ""Evelina, the only person I want is you.""
From then on, Dominic, a high-and-mighty man used to giving orders, dedicated himself entirely to wlnning her over, putting aside his pride.
Over time, his deep love broke through her defenses, and she fell in love.
Throughout the three years after their wedding, he loved her as always, doting on her and attending to every detail.
But when it came to Abrielle, he threw all principles aside.
Evelina had heard about Abrielle—the heiress of the powerful Waldron family.
It was well known that Dominic and Abrielle were rivals, clashing since childhood and never seeing eye to eye.
Yet, Dominic let her have her way in nearly everything, practically spoiling her. They said it was because their families had known each other for generations, and he saw Abrielle as his own sister, who had been spoiled rotten.
At first, Evelina didn't really take it to heart, thinking that the others were exaggerating. But later, she realized they were simply telling the truth.
When Abrielle visited Evelina for the first time, she humiliated Evelina harshly and even poured coffee on her new dress.
After Abrielle's first attack, Evelina cried and begged Dominic to teach her a lesson, but he simply hugged Evelina, delivering cruel words in a gentle voice.
""Eve, Abby's only spoiled; she's not really a bad person. You're fine, so let's just not make a big deal out of it, okay?""
The same thing happened ninety-nine times.
Each time she got hurt, Dominic simply brushed it off as Abrielle acting spoiled.
Evelina could no longer bear it. She would end this marriage he had once promised would never fail!
She clutched the pen, her hand trembling.
Tears finally burst out, falling onto the signature line of the divorce papers, leaving wet stains behind.
She took a deep breath and signed her name firmly on the wet patch.
The butler put away the agreement and said, ""Please be patient, Mrs. Caldwell. I will send you the divorce certificate once it is ready. Until then, please keep this under wraps.""
After the butler left, Evelina was all alone in the silent ward.
Just then, the door swung open again.
Evelina assumed the butler had forgotten something and looked up, only to find Abrielle walking in with a smile, carrying a bouquet of lilies—flowers usually given to the dead!
Evelina was so frightened that her whole body trembled instantly. She instinctively shrank back, her voice shaking. ""What are you doing here?!""
Abrielle threw the lilies to the ground, smiling sweetly yet viciously. ""What do you think? I nearly drained all your blood, but you still survived. Guess I'll have to finish you off this time!""
After saying that, she lunged onto the bed, grabbed a pillow, and pressed it against Evelina's face with all her strength!
 
Chapter 2
Evelina struggled desperately, but she was so weak after having just undergone a major blood transfusion operation that she had no strength at all. As she struggled to breathe, her vision darkened.
Just as she was about to lose consciousness, a nurse on duty entered. Seeing this, she screamed and quickly pushed Abrielle away. ""What are you doing? Someone, help!""
In the chaos, Evelina used her last bit of strength to grab the nurse's hand and uttered with great difficulty, ""Call... Call the police...""
With that, she passed out completely.
When she woke up again, she spotted Dominic's handsome but cold face.
Instead of being worried about her, Dominic said with subtle reproach, ""Why did you call the police, Eve? Because of you, the cops came to take Abby away.""
Evelina's heart was crushed in an instant, and the pain was so severe that she could hardly breathe.
She looked at him. ""Why not? She was suffocating me with a pillow! Why shouldn't I have called the police?"" she replied hoarsely.
Dominic frowned, as though she was being unreasonable. ""Haven't I told you already? Abby's just a kid at heart. Yes, she's a spoiled child who does things without thinking of the consequences, but she didn't actually mean for you to die...""
""Are you sure about that?"" Evelina interrupted him at once. She unleashed the fear, grievance, and anger that had been building up for the past three years. ""She hit me with her car! She locked me in the cold storage! She stuffed me in the oven! She drained my blood! Earlier on, she'd been trying to suffocate me with a pillow! Dominic, which attempt wouldn't have ki lled me? If the nurse hadn't appeared in time, I'd be dead by now, do you understand?!""
Seeing her hysterical and desperate outburst, Dominic seemed a little moved. He hurried forward and wanted to hold her in his arms to comfort her, saying, ""Calm down, Eve...""
""Don't touch me!"" Evelina flung his hand away. She burst into tears, but they stung her eyes. ""I won't give in this time, Dominic! I'll make her pay the price!""
Dominic met the determination in her gaze and fell silent. Slowly, his expression hardened, the warmth in his eyes disappearing.
""Abby and I grew up together. She's just a little spoiled and willful. I've been too indulgent with her over the years. I'll discipline her strictly from now on, but no matter what, I won't let her go to jail.""
Evelina looked at him in disbelief. ""What did you say?""
Dominic signaled for the bodyguard beside him to hand over a document.
""Here's a letter of forgiveness."" Dominic's voice was calm. ""Sign it.""
Evelina looked at the so-called letter of forgiveness, finding it ironic. She shook her head and refused. ""I'm not signing this.""
Dominic pressed his brows together, seemingly losing his patience. ""Abby's a spoiled child who won't last a day in prison. Eve, be a good girl and sign it.""
""I said no!"" Evelina nearly screamed.
Dominic's expression was cold. ""In that case, don't blame me for this.""
""What do you want to do...""
Before Evelina could finish, the bodyguard stepped forward, grabbed her arm, and snapped it in half!
""Ah!"" Evelina's shrill screams echoed throughout the ward.
Severe pain instantly swept over her! The bodyguard grabbed her trembling hand expressionlessly and forced her to sign the letter. He then held her hand, dipped the pen in ink, and guided her hand to mimic her signature!
During the whole process, Dominic stood aside and watched indifferently.
Evelina was sweating from the pain, her face as pale as paper. She raised her head, tears blurring her vision as she looked at the man she had loved for years, her voice breaking. ""Dominic, how dare you treat me like this because of her...""
A hint of pain flashed across Dominic's eyes, but it was gone in a second.
He approached, reaching to touch her cheek, but she turned her head away.
He sighed. ""I don't have a choice, Eve. If I could, I'd hurt myself instead of you. Still, Abby cannot go to jail.""
He turned to his bodyguard and ordered, ""Get the best doctor to heal Mrs. Caldwell's arm. Make sure you take proper care of her.""
After saying that, he picked up the stained letter and left the ward without looking back.
Evelina looked at his resolute back, as if struck by thunder. She froze in place, her tears flowing silently and uncontrollably.
 
Chapter 3
Dominic didn't show up again for the next few days, only texting her every now and then.
""I have some work to do at the company. I'll come visit you when I'm done,"" he texted.
""Don't be mad at me. I'll make it up to you later,"" said one message.
Another wrote, ""Does your hand still hurt? Rest well.""
Each message stabbed at Evelina's heart.
Every time, Abrielle's messages would follow next, and she attached photos of Dominic taking care of her.
He fed her oatmeal, peeled her apples, and even fell asleep by her bedside...
Seeing Dominic's focused, gentle expression in the photographs, Evelina felt a sharp ache in her bosom that quickly turned to numbness.
It turned out his so-called company matters meant taking care of another woman in every possible way!
How could Abrielle be his nemesis? She was obviously someone he cherished deeply!
The day Evelina was discharged happened to fall on her birthday.
Dominic came to pick her up in person.
He seemed to have completely forgotten what had happened and threw a grand birthday party for her.
The venue was lavishly decorated. He stayed with Evelina throughout the party, taking care of her attentively. Dominic even gifted her an expensive necklace, which attracted countless envious gazes as he put it on her.
He seemed to have turned back into the loving and perfect husband he was.
However, Evelina wasn't moved.
Was he doing this out of guilt? Or did he think she'd forget the pain he'd cause her and continue to tolerate Abrielle's childish actions?
Halfway through the party, she needed some fresh air and stepped away to use the washroom.
As soon as she rounded a corner, someone blocked her path.
""Well, well... Isn't it the lovely Mrs. Caldwell?""
Evelina raised her head and saw Abrielle leaning against the bathroom door, arms folded across her bosom, with a sarcastic smile on her face.
Evelina's heart sank suddenly. Not wanting to have anything to do with her, she turned around to leave.
""Are you so proud that you can't even speak?"" Abrielle stepped forward quickly and blocked her way. ""Dom must love you a lot for throwing such a grand party and giving you such an expensive necklace. You must be proud that everyone's envious of you, right?""
Evelina looked at the beautiful but distorted face in front of her, feeling sad.
Was this love?
Where Dominic let Abrielle hurt her repeatedly without any consequences?
Where Dominic simply told her not to take it to heart when Abrielle nearly drained all her blood?
Where Dominic broke her wrist and forced her to sign that humiliating letter of forgiveness?
She didn't want this kind of love!
Hearing no response, Abrielle stepped closer. ""You'd better not be too proud! Who cares if Dominic loves you now? Last time, you called the cops and had me jailed, but didn't he immediately make you sign a letter of forgiveness to get me out? After my release, he kept me company and comforted me, leaving you all alone at the hospital! You'll never mean as much to him as I do!""
Abrielle's words were like blunt knives, stabbing Evelina's already scarred heart.
Her face turned pale, and she bit her lower li p. Evelina turned around, wanting to ignore her and walk away.
""Are you deaf, Evelina?! Can't you hear me talking to you?!"" Abrielle was completely enraged by her disregard. She suddenly grabbed her wrist with astonishing force, her nails almost digging into her flesh. ""Since you're not listening to me, I'll have to teach you a lesson! It's a shame I didn't finish you off last time! Let's see if you're just as lucky this time.""
As soon as she spoke, two tall men suddenly appeared from the shadows and grabbed her from each side!
""Let go of me! What are you doing?"" Evelina struggled in fear, but her strength was nothing compared to the trained bodyguards.
Abrielle sneered, unlocked the utility room next to her, and winked at the bodyguard. ""Let's put her inside!""
Evelina was thrown into the dark utility room, almost tumbling onto the ground. The sharp smell of fuel filled her nose, making her nauseous. She was horrified to see several empty gasoline barrels in the corner, and the wet ground covered in fuel!
""Abrielle! Are you crazy?"" Evelina screamed, rushing toward the door.
But Abrielle was faster. She stood at the door with a crazy and cruel smile on her face and a metal lighter in her hand.
At once, she set fire to the room.
""Enjoy, Mrs. Caldwell."" Abrielle grinned, threw the lighter in, and then slammed the heavy iron door shut.
""Help! Help! Open the door!""
The fire spread quickly. Evelina choked on the thick fume and coughed. She banged on the door desperately but received no response.
The fire spread rapidly, and the scorching air seared her skin. She didn't know how long she had been inside. Amid her despair, she found a small ventilation window in the corner.
She used all her strength to smash the glass, endured the severe pain from the burns, and desperately climbed out of the window!
Covered in burns and bruises, she staggered on her feet, trying to leave the hotel and heading to the hospital.
She passed by a guest lounge with its door ajar. A man and a woman could be heard making love inside, their moans and low gasps sounding awfully familiar.
Evelina didn't want to pay attention, but the man sounded like...
She looked through the crack in the door as if possessed by a ghost, and saw Dominic and Abrielle tangled together on the bed!
 
Chapter 4
Evelina's mind went blank, and the whole world suddenly became silent. The only thing left was the scene in front of her that made her heart tremble!
She felt like she was nailed to the spot, her whole body cold and shaking. She subconsciously stepped back, but accidentally knocked over an antique vase placed in the corridor!
The vase crashed to the floor with a loud thud.
At once, movement in the room stopped.
Dominic turned around suddenly and saw Evelina outside the door, looking like a mess, her face pale.
His expression suddenly changed, and he immediately got out of bed.
After wrapping himself in a bathrobe, he rushed out and grabbed Evelina's arm, saying, ""I can explain, Eve!""
""Abby was drvgged—she was in danger, and she wouldn't let anyone else touch her, so I had no choice but to help her myself... But don't worry, I took precautions. She won't get pregnent. I...""
Evelina looked at his moving li ps, listened to his extremely absurd explanation, and felt a wave of nausea rushing up her throat!
Drvgged? Had no choice? Don't worry?
Was he even listening to himself? This was hands down the most heartless, absurd explanation ever!
She shook off his hand, her eyes filled with despair and disbelief.
She no longer looked at him or Abrielle, who'd been watching them smugly from the bed. She turned around and ran toward the end of the corridor like crazy!
""Eve!"" Dominic subconsciously wanted to chase after her.
""Don't go, Dom. I feel so uncomfortable, and I need more... The drvg hasn't worn off yet..."" Abrielle moaned just then, got out of bed exposed, and hugged Dominic's waist tightly from behind, pressing her warm body against his. ""I will die if you leave me now... Please...""
Dominic stopped in his tracks. He turned around to look at Abrielle, who had a dazed look in her eyes, and looked toward the corridor where Evelina had disappeared. With his brows furrowed, he struggled to decide.
In the end, he gritted his teeth, turned around abruptly, picked up Abrielle, and threw her back on the bed. ""Let's make it quick!"" he growled hoarsely.
He couldn't bear to see Abrielle in trouble.
Meanwhile, Evelina rushed out of the seaside hotel in a daze. The night wind blew, and the burns on her body were so painful that they were excruciating.
Pain and despair overwhelmed her completely. She couldn't even see the road ahead and just ran forward blindly.
A huge billboard on the hotel's facade suddenly broke free, its corroded screws giving way after years of sea-breeze erosion, and it plummeted downward.

1oq9hs1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oq9hs1,White2tea Alienist raw puer,"1 “mini”/90mL, just off boil

Wash (30s) - aroma of roasted coffee, ash

Steep 1 (flash) - heavy bite up front, layered with heavy-roast yancha notes, ashy note in finish, very espresso-like, roast is primary aspect in this steep, hint of fresh-pressed apple juice in the finish, but no real sweetness of note yet

Steep 2 (flash) - bitterness hits with the roast giving the impression of heavy roast coffee, charred meats, fleeting bacon smoke, cacao nibs, hint of baked apples

Steep 3 (flash) - I keep hoping that the roast will start to back off, but it keeps building on previous steeps. Like drinking weak espresso out of an unwashed ashtray. Overcooked bacon, grill grates. Not getting much from the tea itself outside of fleeting yancha-like apple notes that are quickly extinguished, faintest hint of apple sweetness in the finish

Steep 4 (5s) - Drying ashtray notes still in the lead, but finally sitting back to allow more pleasant aspects to show up, roasted peanuts combine with sweetness left on the gums to give a peanut brittle flavor, apples cooked directly in hot coals, sweetness starting to coat gums, but tongue and cheeks with more astringent coating 

Steep 5 (10s) - ash, peanuts, chewing on a cacao nib/espresso bean, apple peels, sweetness low/moderate in finish, but that ashtray never quite goes away

Steep 6 (15s) - char up front, candied roasted nuts, peanut-heavy Zongzi

Overall Impression - I'm not sure what I was expecting coming into this session, but it wasn't this. I really enjoy Airing the Linens, but this is so much more roast-heavy. It's like a cross between espresso and yancha, but that roast is to the level of being charred. The sweetness does develop with time, but by the time it started to take more of a lead role, I had already had enough of this session. I can see how some people might enjoy this, and I think I would actually like this better brewed Western-style, but it is just too ashy up front for my liking.",4,1762459822.0,puer,0,1.0,False

Recently I lay up at night and got so annoyed by Spotify raising their prices that I decided to unsubscribe. Then wondered how best to listen to audio books, if I should get a library pass (I did it) ... anyway, spent hours of just thinking and I decided I want to get back to the medium of CDs.

I used to collect CDs, I don't have that many but a few I really love, been listening to them on my PC or XBOX and want to get a good CD/vinyl player when I've saved some money. They also sell CDs at my favourite bookstore (it's super cozy and you can actually have them unpack them for you so you can give them a try whilst drinking your coffee), but I don't really see any CDs anymore in any other stores, unless it's specifically aimed for older people.

When Spotify really became a thing among everyone I know people laughed at me for still buying CDs, I said it's nice to actually own something and no one ever got it. Now I see how companies can do whatever they want with their 'customers' because they bascially built monopolies, and you don't even really support your favourite artists while listening to them.

My son owns a ""toniebox"" which is a player which you can buy figurines for which play music or stories. Every child here has one and the figurines cost 17€ each and aren't compatible with any other device. Honestly I found it really cool for a while but now thinking about it it blows my mind. He's getting a CD player now like the one I had as a child, but I found the CD market for kids is really limited too.

It’s one of those slightly chilly nights where the playlist is too good, the lights are dim and the air feels heavier than usual, like it’s hinting you to pause and think a bit.
Somewhere between a quiet evening and another round of late work, it hit me that I’ve spent the last few years focused on everything except the space that truly matters.

A few good relationships in the past taught me a lot about how to listen, show up, and how not to lose yourself while doing both. But lately, it’s just been me, my work, and Spotify algorithms that now know me too well.

By day, I’m a Creative Strategist, which basically means I spend half my time turning clutter into ideas and the other half pretending that coffee counts as a meal. I love cooking (it’s my therapy), reading about psychology (because people are endlessly fascinating), and getting lost in long conversations about anything and everything.

I’m not looking for instant fireworks or an over-scripted “connection.” Just someone real, someone who’s also out there trying to make sense of this strange, beautiful mess of being an adult.

I'm 22 I recently moved out of my moms house and into one with my partner were gay we were staying at my m house for a few while we saved up to move out i was paying $400 for rent she said it includes all of my utilities food and everything there when my p mildly moved in, she was just staying with me because I felt uncomfortable at my m house, my p's mom wasn't letting her sleep there unless she was thier maid and paid rent so that wasn't happening. When we moved in I let my p know that my m is very christian so we tried to keep our relationship in our room only going out for the bathroom food and water my pets were in a different room so id leave to care for them every other day I've got reptiles and breed for baby snakes there were cats in our room, there were times we left after everyone had left the living room and kitchen so we would not bother them making ourselves as small as possible. Our step brother came over a couple days in a row and I went out to use the bathroom he stopped me and basically demanded to see my snakes so I went into the room and picked up the baby I was the most excited about she costed about $1300 and was a total sweetheart I wanted to believe that they were safe he said he wanted to buy one and he really likes reptiles just wanted me to sell him a really frendly one and was not willing to trust other reptil breeders opinions and they might sell him a ""aggressive"" he left when it was becoming night and the next morning I went to feed my snakes and the baby I pulled out was crushed to death I don't have the finances to take legal action and am forced to move on since the police station said it wasn't their jurisdiction and I can't afford to get fingerprints done I told my m and she came to the same conclusion that I did but my step brother was back two days later and I moved my reptiles into my room I didn't before because we're in the smallest room and my m has all non neutered male cats and I had three non neutered female cats a mom and two of her kittens that grew up my m used to kidnap the mom cat when she was a kitten up till she got pregnant and I had to deal with the kittens the mom was dropped off at an animal control my p didn't believe we could care for three cats and the mom had some serious indoor issues there were causing us all health issues there wasn't enough filtration with the windows closed and in the space I didn't feel it would be best to kick the cats into the room the reptiles were in and take them as then the door can accidentally pop open and let my girls out to mingle with my M cats.
I put all my reptiles in my room and after a month my mom complained about the electric bill going up $300 the service she uses raised prices about 200-300 and she's got a two story house but blamed me for the bill we covered all the vents to divert the air and she had suggested to cover the vents and crack the window because it was hot with the reptiles she suggested it then proceeded to be mad and said that my p staying here was very manipulative and that when she said that my p being here was okay it actually wasn't they had the week before bonding literally doing puzzles together while I was asleep everything was okay until she got that bill I had stayed in my room continuing my distance and avoidance but went to get a cup of coffee and she followed me coming out of her room and sat on a step stool in the kitchen blocking my path to my room and proceeded to tell me that she loves me but this is a Christian household and gay shit isn't welcome and me and my p need to start looking for a place and I can't really remember the rest of that interaction but I def cried otw back too my room.

I also don't know where to put this it happened after the snake like three days before the no gay shit

I had put some paper in the trashcan and was in my room her trash costs about $1 a bag and recycling is free she had yelled my name and to get my ass in here I came in she pointed at the trash and yelled recycling in the recycling my p came out and said too could we maby say things a little nicer in a clam cautious tone and my m yelled this is my house and that's my daughter of you don't like the elway I talk to my daughter you can get the fuck out of my house I fixed the bag and we went back to our room

I had moved out not too long ago and we've been going back while my m is at work to get my stuff I had came by a hour before she had to go to work and went in with my p we started loading p car up and my m stormed out opened the door to the room we were in saw my p and went back too her room when we're about done p went outside and I went to go grab a few thingss m exited her room glared at me I assumeed she was mad and opened my arms for a hug she sneered turned her head away and begrudgingly gave me a hug started storming off and started to yell about how my p was manipulating me and shes isolated me and to think of how much I see my friends and family and how much I see her friends and family not knowing that ps mom is a lot like my m really similar I'm incredibly happy with p and it wasn't the first time she's. Tried to instill negative feelings between me and p there was one morning p went to visit her mom's and decided against it feeling like driving wasn't safe and sat in her car for about 15 min to detox before coming back into my ms house my m proceeded to insinuate that p could be cheating on me p literally has no time to do that.
After her explosion I left in the middle of it she's not allowed to yell at me anymore I texted her saying ""p is not manipulating me you hurt me when you said gay shit wasn't welcome I'm gay I'm not wanting to hide myself I'm trying to get comfortable in my new situation that time you screamed at me when I put something in the trash can that shouldn't have been in the trash can you said that you can treat me however you wanted to treat me because I was in your house I am out of your house I'm trying to become my own person It's just taking time to get my stuff over to the new place I love you but I'm still working through things.

She responded 
I love you, and I will always welcome you! I'm sorry that I hurt your feelings! Avoiding your family and friends is not the way to work through things. I just see you going through the same roads I went through and don't want to see you going through it alone. I'll leave you be, but always know that I am here whenever you need me.

*Gesten, western Denmark, November 21 1957.*

It was a Thursday afternoon in late autumn, and a man named Hans Haugaard Hansen was driving his car from Gesten to Egholt to pick up supplies for his grocery store. As he got closer to the Gesten forest area, he saw a strange machine over a nearby turnip field owned by Robert Andersen, about 150 – 200 meters away (164 – 219 yards).

At first, Hans thought it was a tractor with a transparent glass cabin, but as he got closer, he saw that it was a 3 meter (10-foot) high pyramid-shaped flying object, which radiating a faint red-orange glow. He stopped the car and let it idle. He then discovered that he could not hear any engine noise from the machine hovering above the field. The object was made of a material that Hans thought resembled semi-transparent plexiglass. Inside, he could see two people facing each other sitting still on chairs at some controls. It then flew on at 60 – 70 km/h (37 – 43 miles/h) towards a hill in the nearby field where it looked as if it landed for 1 minute, but they could just as easily have hovered low above the ground on the hill without landing, according to Hans. It was difficult to tell. After that, the pyramid-shaped glass object flew away at treetop altitude towards the marshland near Gesten and disappeared from sight.

[The surprised man could see a strange pyramid shaped machine hover above the field. Inside where two men. \(CGI interpretation\)](https://preview.redd.it/r56eu2grwozf1.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f767d461d16ccf20427660bc169c8d1a4c1f13ed)

When Hans returned from his errand in Egholt, he stopped at the site of the sighting and went out into the field to look for physical traces of the now gone craft, but he found nothing. He then contacted the police and told them what he had seen. They in turn asked the Danish Air Force at the base in nearby Karup if they had seen anything on radar or if they had been flying in the area at the time, and they had not. However, the police were contacted by other witnesses who had also seen strange things that afternoon.

[The Gesten craft as interpreted by a weekly magazine.](https://preview.redd.it/sdlcg3u2xozf1.jpg?width=981&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6819469ede4f171916dea2e6bba4c6f3d66dd524)

At almost the same time in the nearby village of Jordrup, two people had just stepped out of a barn on their farm when they saw a pyramid-shaped object hovering low over the ground. The witnesses described the craft as flying slowly above the ground at a low altitude and when it came to a fence it increased in height just enough to pass over the obstacle. It also seemed to follow all differences in the terrain in a similar way. They could not hear any engine noise from the craft other than a faint humming sound. It also had some kind of light or glow on its underside that illuminated the ground below it.

In yet another South Jutland town, Vorbasse, three people also saw a UFO at 4 pm on the 21st of November 1957. The office manager Niels Poder, his wife and a woman named Amalie Nielsen saw a glowing object shaped like a T or a cross flying at a very low altitude. This sighting lasted roughly 10 minutes. The three witnesses described the UFO’s vertical bar as glowing but the horizontal bar being dark.

**The large mothership in the fjord.**

*Kågsund, northen Norway, August 21 or 22 1963.*

Helge Mikalsen was going out fishing on a Saturday evening with his boat. He left the harbor in the village of Skjervøy at about 5:00 pm. Half an hour later he was at the fishing spot at Kågsund straight. The weather was nice and it was calm and clear. After fishing for a while without results, he moved on to another place, a small shallow area at the Skjervøy reef. He aimed his gaze to use Arnøy island as a reference point to find the place where he knew there used to be fish.

It was now 6:30 PM, and as he looked west again towards Arnøy, he saw a flame from what he thought was a rocket, launched from the mountain on the island. He thought it might be the navy that was having an exercise, but if so, it was something new and strange they were testing. The flame he saw was 2 meters wide (6.5 feet) and it was orange. He sat in the boat and watched it as it went up into the sky, and he noticed that the speed was not as high as when a flare or New Year's rocket is launched. But when it got about 2000 meters (6500 feet) into the sky, it disappeared. Instead, he saw something large and gray in the sky, which he at first thought was a balloon or parachute. But he soon saw that it was a large craft of some kind.

There was a slight breeze from the east and large grey clouds were now heading towards him from the landward side, but the craft was heading from the sky towards the wind down towards the sea surface. The object was getting closer and closer all the time and Helge sat in his boat and stared at it fascinated. It passed over Singlatinden and Mikkeby at the same height, but then started flying lower and turned around from land and came out towards the sea again where Helge sat in his boat.

[Helge in his boat watched as a smaller craft was heading towards the larger craft. It docked with the mothership and then disappeared inside. \(CGI interpretation\)](https://preview.redd.it/z21tisukxozf1.jpg?width=1312&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bc639cf45234dc2d35fdfb681425a48809f4a341)

Now he could also see that there were two objects, one small one that was heading towards the larger one. The larger craft had several large oval windows on the top, about 10 m (33 feet) in size, and five or six of these were facing the witness. He estimated the distance to the larger ship to be about 150 meters (493 feet) and it was now hovering about 15 – 20 meters (50 – 65 feet) above the water surface. Suddenly, two rails or steel beams or something similar came out of the larger UFO and the smaller craft flew down and landed on them. Then the rails with the parked mini-UFO went into the larger craft and disappeared. The smaller craft was oval in shape and about 2 meters high and 3 meters wide (6.5 x 10 feet). The witness noted that he could not hear any noise, see any flames or smoke during the whole event.

It was now 6:40 PM and Helge felt himself starting to get both scared and nervous as he sat watching the unexplainable thing that was happening. He looked around to see if there were other people out there who could have also seen everything, but there wasn't a single boat out in the fjord at that time. Maybe it was because it was a Saturday night, because otherwise there used to be a lot of boats out fishing all day. It had started get a little more windy now, and the sea was getting darker with some white peaks, but under the big UFO the water was completely calm and still.

[Suddenly a bright green light came on in one of the windows and at the same time shapes of people could also be seen inside. \(CGI Interpretation\)](https://preview.redd.it/mnqz0pfgxozf1.jpg?width=647&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3f277cd2fc18c2ab017cd742b7dbfdff4b40069e)

Suddenly, Helge saw a green light coming towards him from one of the large windows of the big craft. The light was about 30 cm (12 inches) and round, and it changed color from light green to dark green. He could also see what looked like figures or dark shapes moving in the windows behind the light. The witness only now noticed that he had caught a fish and tried to pull it up but could not. It was as if he had become paralyzed. Whether it was because he was tense or if it was due to something else like the green light, he did not know.

The witness estimated the large mothership to be about 10 meters high (33 feet) and 35 – 40 meters wide (115 – 131 feet), he thought it was round, but it could also have been oval, as he only saw one side of it the whole time. It was flat at the bottom with a small rise in the middle at the top. The color of the ship was aluminum gray. The small craft that had previously docked with the large mothership had the same color. Helge also thought it was a bit strange that the big craft was hovering above the wreck of a German cargo ship that sank in 1944, loaded with iron ore and mercury.

[Suddenly small object emerged from the water surface and got sucked up into the belly of the large craft. \(CGI interpretation\)](https://preview.redd.it/khj4debixozf1.jpg?width=634&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=be31434eb409d7fe720cfa55b52bfb40e26e3c6a)

But now the witness saw something even stranger. Some dark objects (he was unsure how many) came up from the sea under the large craft, or if it was releasing something. Here he is not entirely sure, but it looked as if the objects (crafts?) raised out of the sea and floated up to the large ship and were sucked into it.

The large mother ship had now been standing in the same place for 10 minutes, when it began to tilt slightly to the side and then slowly lift upwards. Suddenly it increased its speed silently and disappeared towards the Kvenangen fjord at incredible speed. Then it was gone. Helge Mikalsen quickly pulled up the fishing lines and went home towards Skjervøy village very shaken and disturbed.

This story was told many years later and the witness must have remembered the date incorrectly because August 21 1963 is a Wednesday. August 17 was a Saturday.

**The strange craft at the shore.**

*Lake Näsijärvi, western Finland, July 1966.*

It was mid-day and just around 1:00 – 1:30 PM and a man had been out fishing in the large Lake Näsijärvi. He was lying with his boat along side the north side of the island of Pikku-Hormu. Having finished the fishing job for today he was now taking a well deserved one-hour lunch-break in the sun on the northern shore of the lake. He was eating a sandwich and drinking coffee when he heard over the gentle lapping of the waves of the shore, an increasing rushing noise from the south of the island. He thought that it was another boat coming towards the island and soon after a sound resembling someone dropping an anchor was heard. Then a very loud hammering noise began and the man assumed the other boat needed repairs. After this the noise faded, but then he heard footsteps from behind, first from one person, then two persons. As he expected that they would come forward and talk to him, he did not turn around. When nothing happened, he rose and packed his things and walked over to his boat and lifting the line into the boat and then he jumped onboard and began to slowly rowing away from the shore in in his boat.

The man then thought he wanted to see what the other boat looked like and soon he reached the southern side of the island and he saw it from a distance of about 30 meters (98 feet). He was surprised to see that it had a row of oval windows, through which a faint light was shining. After a while he looked again and was even more surprised when he noticed that the ship was actually standing on the shore and over the surface of the island and not in the water. In the area between the ship and the island he could see someone walking about. The “ship” was standing on four telescopic legs, two of which were shorter as the slope of the shore was quite steep. On the island side of the ship a ladder with three or four steps was clearly visible.

[A strange craft had landed at the shore and humanoids were seen around it. \(CGI interpretation\)](https://preview.redd.it/m1i0gjlbyozf1.jpg?width=1120&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c2c784892832f8c97544b121dfb0b763d7fa7dd4)

The fisherman now felt that there was something strange about this ”ship” and that it might not come from this world, but he was curious and he continued to observe it, approaching it even further. Apparently someone onboard the ship did not appreciate this and they shone a bright beam of light towards him as he tried to come closer. This ceased after a while however, and he could now see some persons or humanoids around the ship. Altogether he could see five humanoids, three tall and two smaller. As they were most of the time behind the ship, he could not see many details, but the could notice that they were clad in blue overalls of some sort.

Finally all humanoids got into the ship, which then began to ascend. The telescopic legs, which had rounded plates on the bottom, retracted into black holes on the bottom of the ship, which was oval shaped, some 2.5 meters high (8.2 feet) and 6 meters (19.7 feet) in width. After it had ascended to an altitude of several “tree heights” it accelerated at a great speed towards the northwest sky. It then disappeared into the distance.

**Tall humanoid freightened cyclist.**

*Skara, south-west Sweden, July 2013.*

The date was Monday, July 1. It was early in the morning and bright outside as the sun had already been up for a while and for “Thomas” it was the last working week before a long-awaited summer vacation. The witness, who wanted to remain anonymous, took his bicycle to work as usual as he lived relatively close by. To get there he had to cycle through the central parts of the town of Skara. He started his job at seven, but since the door at work was locked before that time, he did not cycle so fast so that he would not have to stand and wait too long at the door when he arrived.

“Thomas” always took the same route to work, which was a combination of roads, cycle paths and footpaths in a densely built-up residential area. When he approached the Djurgårdsvägen/ Gällkvistgatan intersection, he slowed down and took his mobile phone out of his pocket to check the time, which showed 6:42 PM. He was a little ahead of schedule, so he continued to pedal relatively leisurely because he was in no hurry. After a minute, he turned off towards a park area. In front of him was a paved cycle path that went over a bridge with a small stream running underneath, and a little further on, the path split. Here, “Thomas” was to turn right onto a gravel path that went over a small meadow.

[When the nervous man on the bike came closer to the intersection the tall humanoid also slowly walked closer. \(CGI interpretation\)](https://preview.redd.it/yxtr8lpnyozf1.jpg?width=1040&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8510f417dd7adfffb6014ab06000c8341757e074)

But as he cycled towards the T-junction, he suddenly heard a loud bang. 30 – 35 meters (98 – 115 feet) further ahead, next to a street lamp, “Thomas” saw someone or something. It looked like a tall person and the witness got the impression that it just appeared out of nowhere, as if it had landed there. The figure was about two meters tall (6.5 feet) and very broad across the shoulders. “Thomas” now became a little nervous but slowly rolled closer with his bike. *“What kind of weird guy is that?”* he thought. At the same time, the figure also started walking towards him quickly and jerkily, with heavy steps and with his arms hanging straight down at his sides. He could hear the shoes dragging on the ground.

Now the figure was much closer to the witness and he could clearly see that it was not a human. It was some kind of being and it had no ears, no nose and it was bald on its pear-shaped head. The face was completely smooth and rigid and he thought it almost looked like a baby if it hadn't been for the distinctive eyes. They were large, black and square and had yellow, brightly colored irises with black pupils in the middle. ""Thomas"" could see how the being's eyes moved and followed him with his intense gaze as he cycled towards it. The mouth, however, was small, just like a line and it looked almost like a fine-meshed net. On the body, the humnoid had clothes made of a wrinkled and rough blue reflective fabric that almost resembled tarpaulin. The jacket had wide sleeves and the trousers too. On its feet it wore very strange shoes that were black and quite high and looked like upside down bowls. The being walked towards “Thomas” without lifting its feet and its arms hung motionless down by its sides. Despite its shuffling gait, it walked quickly. Finally, after 10 - 15 seconds, it was only 2 meters (6.5 feet) from the witness. Now “Thomas” was very scared and felt that the hairs on his body stood up, but still it did not feel as if the being was threatening. Just then “Thomas” was at the intersection and turned to the right with his bicycle in front of the being.

[Recontruction of the event by the UFO researchers: The tall humanoid was standing in the intersection staring at the bicyclist as he drove away in the same manner as the man in the picture. \(photo: UFO Aktuellt\)](https://preview.redd.it/n7svzb5uyozf1.jpg?width=1097&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6f95511a10d16de02e9376bf9f949f83ab83d74e)

When he turned from the larger path and cycled 10 meters (33 feet) onto the smaller gravel part, he looked back and saw that the humanoid had stopped and was standing there staring at him with its intense gaze. “Thomas” also noticed that it was starting to become transparent, as he could now see the large bushes and trees behind the being. It was as if it was about to disappear. At the same time as it was about to dissolve into thin air, an egg-shaped white light began to shine in the middle of its body. The light flowed out to all directions and became bigger and bigger and then the being was gone. “Thomas” cycled on, wondering if it was an angel he had just seen. The observation of the being lasted about 1 minute.

When the witness arrived at work, he told his boss what he had experienced and when he got home, he told his family about the incident. After this, “Thomas” no longer dared to cycle through the park to work anymore, so he started driving his car instead. He was afraid that the being would be waiting for him. It would be a long time before he dared to return to the place and he often wondered what otherworldly creature he had encountered on the bike path in the park that fine summer morning.

1oq95x4,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlyChild/comments/1oq95x4/am_i_acting_like_too_much_of_an_only_child_when/,Am I acting like too much of an only child when it comes to my roommates' messiness and clutter?,"Obviously, since I'm posting this here, I am an only child. I am so scared of having like only child syndrome or something and getting annoyed by things that are just normal in households with siblings and more people. I try to be conscious about it but I just truly don’t know where that line is drawn. 

I’m a junior in college and I live in a house with 4 other girls who are seniors. Unfortunately, our space is not very big, as you might expect in a college house. We only have one small fridge and almost no counter or cabinet space, as well as no dining room (we eat at the coffee table in the living room). I wouldn’t say I’m the most organized or cleanliest person ever, but I do like to keep shared living spaces clean because I don’t want roommates to be frustrated with my clutter or anything like that. I also don’t really cook a lot, so I almost never any dishes or pans. If I need a plate or silverware, we have paper plates and plastic silverware that I’ll use. I know disposable stuff is an extra cost and not super great for the environment, but I don’t want to add more clutter to the kitchen.  

My roommates tend to leave a lot of stuff in the shared living spaces like the kitchen, bathroom, and living room. Our kitchen, specifically, is what irritates me the most. Even though I don’t really cook, all of my roommates do cook a lot. But, when they cook they leave their pots/pans on the stove and their dishes either on the coffee table or piled in the sink. I get that it’s annoying to clean up right after cooking or like when you’re in the middle of a show, so I get not cleaning it up right away. But, a lot of times it will stay there overnight, 24 hours, and sometimes longer. Sometimes the sink is filled up so bad I can’t even use the faucet. Even though I don’t cook a whole lot, sometimes I do want to, but all the pans are dirty, or the sink is so full that I can’t put the dirty pans that are on the stove into the sink so the stove is clear. And there are times where their plates will be sitting on the counter in the kitchen or in the living room and still have food on them from the night before. And I know college fridges are crazy, so I’m not as irritated by the overcrowding in the fridge, but it’s gotten to a point where I can’t buy anything refrigerated because there’s no room in the fridge for it. All I have in there right now is a little container of chicken salad and a little container of watermelon, and I have no room for anything else. We loosely designated sections of the fridge at the beginning of the year, and mine has just kinda been taken over. There’s constantly blankets, pillows, shoes, and other random clutter all over the living room floor and table. I’m the only one that changes the toilet paper in our shared downstairs bathroom because I’ll go to the bathroom and there’s an empty roll on the holder (our rolls are literally directly beneath the holder on a cart). There’s also constantly makeup residue all over the bathroom, dripping down the sink and on our handtowel. One weekend, all my roommates went home, and I had to do all the dishes in the sink because they left food in them when they went home. 

I’ve been pretty passive about this since the beginning of the year and haven’t mentioned it to them, just because I know it’s such a small house and we’re all busy with classes and work and stuff. But a couple weeks ago for homecoming, I baked for a party, and got some batter on the stove. I didn’t realize it because I avoid the stove because of everything stated above. 3 days after the party one of the roommates texted and said to make sure we’re cleaning the stove after we use it. One of my other roommates responded and asked me directly to clean up the batter off the stove. I immediately responded and apologized for not seeing it and i would clean it up once i got home from class. The original roommate that texted said she already cleaned it and to just remember next time. It just kind of frustrated me because I would say I’m the least messy out of anyone in this house and that was the first time anybody has messaged our group chat about messes in the house. Like, when they went home that weekend there was literally leftover meat in the sink I had to clean up. It just kind of sucked that the one time I leave a mess because I didn’t realize it was there, that’s the time someone gets called out in the groupchat for a mess when I’ve cleaned up their messes on multiple occasions. 

So am I overreacting to this or being a super annoying only child?

Dear \[Agent\]

I’m seeking representation for *At-Will*, a 93,500-word (complete) work of literary fiction that explores corporate exploitation through dark comedy and moral ambiguity.

Nathan, a British-American marketer, is laid off during the pandemic. His father suffers the same fate. With no health insurance and six figures of medical debt after his mother’s COVID hospitalization, Nathan lands a new remote role. Then he realizes: if companies can fire employees *at will*, why can’t he work *at will* for multiple employers? One job becomes two. Then three. Then four. At one point, he’s juggling seven full-time jobs. Meanwhile, his father - after decades of loyalty and always playing by the rules - remains jobless.

With the help of coffee, his partner’s ADHD meds, and a bowl of strawberries, Nathan’s job juggling works. For a while. But when his secret work life falls apart, Nathan is forced to decide what he’s really fighting for, and what it will cost to win.

*At-Will* is a darkly funny novel that questions the increasingly cold realities of corporate America, and asks whether fighting a corrupt system makes you a rebel, or just another exploiter. In an age when profitable companies lay off thousands while executives collect record salaries, it captures the moment workers stopped pretending the system was fair. It will appeal to readers of Joshua Ferris’s *Then We Came to the End* and Paul Beatty’s *The Sellout*; novels that blend absurdist humor with moral unease to illuminate modern work and identity. It will also resonate with anyone who’s been laid off, survived layoffs, or found solidarity in online spaces like r/antiwork or r/overemployed.

I’m a British \[my career path\] who moved to the U.S. twenty years ago and have spent fifteen years inside corporate America, at startups, agencies, and tech companies including \[XYZ\]. I’ve been laid off twice. My professional experience shapes the novel’s world, where the line between absurd fiction and reality is blurred. This is my first novel.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

With half a pill every day, and calorie deficit/working out, I lost 20 pounds, but what I noticed enjoying the most was the focus and energy I got every day. Man, even my boss noticed I procrastinated less, I get more done at home when I am on it. My doctor left her practice and I had to see a new person and she is VERY against Phentermine. Fair enough, but I no longer take it for weight loss. I have stayed the same weight for two months now to prove it wasnt for weight loss in hopes she would keep me on it but it appears that is not the case and getting my prescription refilled has become a MAJOR hassle.

So my question is, has anyone found an energy and focus equivalent to Phentermine? I have stopped taking the pills for a week now to save them for when the lack of energy gets really bad, but I am up to three cups of coffee a day and I am still dog ass tired and my focus and ability to get stuff done is absolute crap.

1oq92gm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oq92gm,Important announcement from Discord about the future of the app,"I’m not a mod or a dev, please do not direct your anger at me.

I saw this announcement on the Status official discord 2 hours ago, and considering it still hasn’t been posted yet and discord is kind of a closed community, I decided to post the announcement here.

Here’s the full text of the announcements of the screenshots aren’t working for you:

“Hey everybody -

Some of you might have followed the discussion I had with members of the Discord yesterday. We had an internal team discussion and have decided to share a bit more with you guys so everyone can understand why we are taking the current steps.

These points are meant to build on top of our previous announcement, and everything said there still applies.
First, it's important to understand that a free app is ""financed"" by its paying users. The more free stuff we give out (number of free actions per day), the more paying users have to pay to have the app as a whole breakeven (revenue >= cost).

Second, here are our rough costs and revenues. I'll preface by saying our COSTS are in USD$. Some people have mentioned that where they live X$ is a lot. Yes, we understand that, but at the end of the day our costs are in USD$ and that's not something we can change. Therefore, we have to base our prices in USD$ to cover our costs in USD$.

As of last month, **the average cost per user is about 5x higher than the average revenue per user.** This means the app is running at a loss. Users who use many actions a day, or across multiple accounts, cost much more to support. As a reference, only a small portion of users actually use more than 20 actions per day.

Third, we are more and more weighting towards making the app pay-to-play, period. Making it so would mean paying users would get more actions per $ they spend because they don't have to ""finance"" the free users.

-

Fourth, following our drop from 50 actions to 20 actions/day earlier this week, our overall costs have decreased while our revenue has increased, down to about 3.5x the cost versus revenue (1x = breakeven). This is progress, but still not enough to reach breakeven. Our plan now is to gradually decrease the number of daily actions until we reach sustainability. This is a quick immediate step we can take: adding a subscription-based system is more complex as it requires app changes to support.

In summary, we will most likely be moving to a pay-to-play model gradually. We had already polled the Discord in the past around this discussion, and in general a small amount of users are ready to pay to play. Unfortunately for users that cannot afford to pay, they won't be able to play anymore. Fortunately for users that can afford to pay, it will be less costly at that moment to have a subscription than to pay for coffees. 

What's coming up:
- Starting tomorrow, the number of free actions will be reduced by an additional 2. This process will repeat every 2 to 5 days as we track our cost -vs- revenue.
- In the coming month, we will decide on the best long-term course of action: most probably a subscription based system. This requires more time to develop and implement in the app which is why we can't simply do it right now.”


Again, I am not remotely affiliated with the Status devs in any way, I just felt like it was kind of scummy not to have posted this VERY important announcement on any social media for everyone to see.",4,1762458873.0,statusAI,2,1.0,False
1oq910u,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestructiveReaders/comments/1oq910u/742_cuffed/,[742] Cuffed,"I’ve always wondered if they paint interrogation rooms in that sickly yellow eggshell shade and blast the greenest fluorescent light they can find for some psychological reason–or if it’s just a cruel design choice.  
Either way, it feels like the room itself is trying to squeeze the truth out of you.

I’ve actually considered offering to repaint it. Maybe something soft, like sage green. Anything that doesn’t make me feel like I’m about to puke the moment I walk in.  
But I guess I should get used to it. These little trips to the room of nausea are about to become part of my daily routine.

Honestly, the entire building could use divine intervention–or a bulldozer.  
If it were up to me, I’d say tear it down and start from scratch. But hey, small victories: someone replaced the fifth-floor coffee machine two years ago.  
It still makes the worst coffee known to mankind.

John used to say, *“We’re not here for the gastronomical experience,”* every time I complained.  
But John’s gone now. And without him, I don’t feel bad admitting the truth–the coffee tastes like burned dirt.

You’d think cops would at least get their coffee and donuts right. Isn’t that, like, the universal stereotype?  
But no. Even that we can’t manage.

So instead, I go to Panera on 5th every morning before work.  
Bagels are just fancier, more cultured cousins of donuts.

They open at five, and by five-thirty, I’m there with my hazelnut coffee and two cinnamon raisin bagels with cream cheese.  
Before you say it–yes, it’s excessive.  
And no, I don’t care.  
I like my bagels, I like my coffee, and I care more about them than I ever will about your opinion.

The metal doors screech across the linoleum – that ungodly sound that means my “project” of the day has arrived.  
 John used to say it’s not exactly *protocol* to call interview subjects *projects*. But then again, John’s not my mentor anymore.

If life hadn’t gotten the best of him, he’d be sitting here in my place right now, probably sipping the same cup of liquid disappointment we call coffee.  
So, am I glad he quit? I don’t know. Time will tell.

I liked John more than most people in this building, but I never really saw him as an authority.  
And one Friday evening proved me right.

He came over to my desk with a box of chocolates and that guilty smirk. Said he’d just turned in his resignation.  
I’m still not sure why he thought a handful of overpriced candy could make up for keeping his plans a secret from the person he’d been calling his *favorite protégé* for two months straight.

But I didn’t ask.  
He was too good at manipulation – I’d seen him twist murderers, traffickers, even sociopaths.  
So I figured if I asked, he’d just do the same thing to me.

Two Marshals with their funny little hats brought him in.  
The first thing I noticed was that he had the exact same build as them — broad, stiff, regulation-issue posture. But that’s where the similarities ended.

Hard, Slavic jawline, the kind that looked like it could cut through the glass without shattering it. Eyes a shade of cold, clear gray — sharp, assessing, and absolutely devoid of warmth. Just a compact block of muscle and barely contained violence. The kind of face you instinctively don’t trust… but damn if it wasn’t striking.

I’ve never seen a Marshal with a thought behind his eyes.  
 Actually, I’ve never seen a Marshal who looked capable of forming a coherent thought.

“We’re starting record number 35221 – interrogation of federal prisoner number 889212, Mikhail Frolov. November eighth, 2026,” I said, not bothering to mask the irritation in my voice as they sat him down.

The scrape of metal against metal rang through the room — sharp, echoing, and grating enough to make anyone listening to this recording suffer.

“Hello, Mr. Frolov,” I greeted. “I’ll be conducting your interviews from now on, since Agent Mayers is no longer available for this case.”

“Yeah, I know, hun. He told me he’s opening a private practice.”  
 His accent was faint, barely there – just enough to scratch the edges of his words.

And yeah, way to go, John. Telling a federal prisoner about your life plans before telling *me* – classic.

“Well, anyway,” I said, keeping my tone sweet enough to rot teeth, “I’m Agent Ella White. From now on, I’ll be continuing our cooperation.”

Blinding Lights

I stared up at the ceiling fan slowly spinning overhead, a single imperfect speck of missing paint on one of the blades orbiting the center like a moon around a planet. I wasn't sure when I had opened my eyes, or when I had closed them to go to sleep. I could only remember plopping onto my bed yesterday, and then I was looking at the fan. I really only knew I had slept, and that it was morning, because I could see the dim sunlight through the stormy cloud cover in my window. I continued to just lay there and listen to the rain and thunder as I watched the dizzy dance of the speck on the fan. Enough time went by that the little light penetrating the clouds from the sun had changed angles, no longer shining directly in my window. My stomach groaned in protest of my lethargy, I needed to get up and eat.

Dragging each foot out of bed like they were weighted down by steel shoes, my knees and back snapping, crackling, and popping like a cereal commercial. I meandered into my kitchen, shuffling past the mess to open the fridge. A single can of coke and half of a gallon of milk. A look into my pantry didn't show much better with a jar of peanut butter and a bag of rice. My stomach rumbled again, upset at the lack of food readily available. I let out a sigh, grabbing my hoodie, wallet, and keys as I head out the door.

The police tape outside a grim reminder of Beth, I pulled my hood up over my head. More to hide the sight of it from my view than to shield me from the rain. An image of Beth hanging from a rope with black sludge pouring from her mouth flashed in my mind like lightning in the sky, gone as fast as it came but bright and vibrant. Illuminating the gray clouds in my thoughts long enough for me to see for a moment the horrors within. I shook my head, as if to Etch-A-Sketch away the picture seared into my thoughts. I looked up to my car as I walked into the parking lot, and my shoulders slumped. All four of my tires were flat, a gash carved into the side of each of them. I paced around my car, looking around for any signs of anyone nearby who might have seen anything. Scanning around towards the complex, I thought I saw someone dart out of sight in a window as the curtain closed.

There was no one around, and my stomach was now rolling like a cement mixer. Who would do this? Why? I looked back at my car as if the tires would magically be full of air again, and let out a single ""fuck"" before deciding to start walking to the store. It wasn't all too far, maybe a quarter mile outside the complex. Trying to find a bright side in it, I thought maybe a walk would be good for me. I enjoyed rainy weather, and the occasional thunder sending tremors across the sky was soothing to me. I was still perplexed by my tires being slashed, but I wasn't going to solve that problem on an empty stomach. One problem at a time, one step at a time, one foot in front of the other.

It was on this thought it occurred to me I could hear another set of footsteps behind me. I slowed down for a bit, and so did they, an unsettling feeling clawing down my neck. I shot a glance back, at an empty sidewalk. I kept walking and the following footsteps persisted behind me, every so often looking back to the same vacant space on the pavement behind me. I pulled my hood strings nervously, tightening my hood like a child hiding under the covers from a monster in the closet.

Just ahead, a back alley shortcut between the apartment complex and a neighborhood lead to the shopping center. A dog in a backyard barked as I walked by, startling a cat hiding behind a trashcan and sending it running down the alley behind me. I traced it with my gaze, following it back until my eyes land upon something that stopped me in my tracks.

At the center of the alleyway stood what looked like a bear swathed in a veil, an open maw dripping black saliva, and eyes like hurricanes. Swirling dark clouds that warped the alley into dueling singularities. The ground beneath me pulled like the concrete had been turned to liquid, flowing like a river into the teeth of this creature. I tried to look away but it was like my vision was anchored in the murky fathoms of the beast, and simply averting my eyes felt like I was tearing them from their sockets. The instant it took me to finally look away from it dilated into hours. It felt I was tidally locked with it as it tried pulling me in as I tried pushing away. I could see the rain drops that fell between us slow to a hovering halt, all crashing down together as I finally escaped its gravity.

Then it was gone, and I was alone in the alley. I frantically looked about, expecting some animal to lunge out of nowhere, before I remembered what I was doing in the first place at the sound of my gut preparing to devour the rest of my organs.

My feet following the command before my brain fully clicked back into place, I was still drawn in by what I had just seen. As if though it was gone, I had seen it long enough for some part of me to have been sucked into it and I could still perceive it through that consumed component. I could suddenly recall seeing something like it in my dreams, that it had been stalking me from the dark recesses of my consciousness and leaving before I could fully witness it. I felt empowered at the thought of it having made a mistake, having gotten greedy and stayed too long to feast upon me that I could finally see it after it had left. If I could identify it, find its patterns, maybe I could figure out what was wrong with me and overcome. I was so in my head with this revelation, it wasn't until I heard the ding of the bell at the door did I realize I made it to the store.

The small general store had a limited grocery section and a cafeteria kind of eatery attached to the gas station convenient store, a perfect one stop shop that I had been a regular at since I moved into my apartment. The owner, Marvin, could usually be found behind the counter or in the kitchen. He employed his two sons, Joshua and Joseph, and the three of them ran the store.

""Mikey! Good to see you man!"" Marvin's warm, booming voice always filled the store. ""You're in early. You want breakfast? It's on the house, Joey cooked way too many eggs this morning I'd be throwing them out anyway.""

I could have cried with joy at the offer. My hunger having me feeling like I had crawled through the desert and he just offered me water.

""That'd be great, Marv.""

I sat down at one of the two tables as he brought out a plate with two eggs, and a few pieces of bacon, and a cup of coffee.

""I know you don't usually drink coffee, but you look like you could use it.""

Marvin said, eyeing me up and down. I know he meant it sincerely, but a piece of me felt like it was a jab. Who was I kidding? I looked like shit, I couldn't blame him. While shoveling through the breakfast, I saw a woman in rags outside looking at me. She seemed familiar somehow, but I couldn't put my finger on it. I could tell she was looking more at my food than at me.

""Hey Marv, what's with her?""

""Who? Oh, her. Just one of the bums that hangs out around here. I had to eighty-six her after she came in all strung out one time."" He said, kind of lowering his voice. ""Feel bad for her, but I got a business to run, ya' know?""

""Yeah, I get it. Would I be able to take some food out to her? I'll pay for it.""

""Well, I suppose you could. Here take the rest of these eggs out. I gotta make space for lunch prep anyway.""

He put a heap of scrambled eggs on a paper plate and hand it to me, and I took it outside. The woman had been watching me the whole time, and seemed uneasy as I approached her.

""Hey, I saw you and thought you looked hungry. Here.""

I said as I thrust the plate towards her. She looked stunned that I wasn't telling her to go away, and looked at the plate as if to evaluate it, expecting it to contain some kind of threat.

""Its just eggs, I ordered way too much and thought this was better than throwing them away.""

With that kind of gesturing the plate towards the trashcan by the front of the store.

""No! No, I'll take it, thank you.""

Her hands jumped as if to catch the plate if my gesturing had thrown it, exposing her desperation for food. I gave her the plate, and she started digging into it with her fingers as soon as I did. She was surprisingly attractive, all things considered. Though her face was dirty, it was pretty, and as her feral demeanor dropped while she ate she looked back at me with beautiful blue eyes.

""Thank you, really. I haven't eaten in awhile.""

She said after finishing the eggs, I only then just realizing I was still standing there rather awkwardly kind of watching her eat.

""Would you like a cigarette? I always like one after I eat."" She said, pulling out a pack.

I don't know what came over me, perhaps some kind of mourning of Beth, as I said ""Yes.""

""Here, need a light?""

""Yeah, I don't usually smoke. Thanks""

I said as I put the cigarette in my mouth and lit it. I had smoked before in college, usually at a dorm party with a night of drinking or something like that, but I never really picked up the habit. It was strangely refreshing. Something about standing under the awning of the store in the rain, just having a pleasant encounter with another human and having a cigarette, it was nice. I coughed as I inhaled the smoke.

""I'm going to get going before Marvin gets mad I'm out here, thanks again."" She said, and before I even thought about what I was saying, words came out.

""Mind if I join you? I've got time to kill.""

What the hell was I doing?

""Uh, sure, yeah if you want to. I was just going to ride the bus for a bit to get out of the rain."" She seemed equally unsure and excited about my company, I somehow felt the same. After everything lately, a chance to not be alone was alluring.

We sat together at the bus stop, and I thought this was the longest I had been around someone without a cubicle divider between us in years. In the minutes it took for the bus to arrive, I had spaced out. I snapped out of it to the sound of her voice.

""You coming?""

A simple question, but as I looked up at her she looked like an angel with her outstretched hand and the light from the bus outlining her silhouette.

""Yeah. Yeah I am.""

I stood up and hopped on the bus. There was only a few other riders, an elderly couple in one row, and some teenager with their headphones on in another. As I took my seat, it dawned on me that no one was looking at me. Everywhere I had gone recently it felt like everyone was watching me, but here they were all just minding their own business. I looked over to see the woman in rags lean her head against the window and close her eyes. I wondered if she had been up all night, and with a full stomach could finally sleep.

Just taking in the scenery out the bus windows, I rode around town for hours. At some point the woman's blonde head changed sides to be resting on my shoulder, and I rest mine upon hers as I fell asleep.

Chapter 8

Dancing In The Dark

Out the window, the sky was a pearlescent array of pinks and purples. The clouds swirled like a Van Gogh painting, spiraling around windows through the shroud to a starry sky beyond. I looked down the walkway of the bus, to find it empty. It was just me and the blonde woman with her head resting on my shoulder.

In the window beside us, my reflection was smiling back at me. I shivered as it winked, stirring the woman awake. She looked up at me but I couldn't see her face, just a blank slate where her eyes, nose, and mouth should have been. I went to stand up but tripped backwards landing in the seat across and my head whipping to view the opposing window. Through it I could see myself, but from the other side, as if looking from the reflection. There I was, head on her shoulders, looking up with a smile. She stirred, looking away from where I was and up to my reflection. I watched them kiss, then looked down to a sudden sensation of falling.

I went down for a long time before going through what looked like an alter, light now cast all around me but warped as though I were looking through curved glass. Above me I could see myself and the woman in wedding clothes, before her hand reached towards me as if to go through me.

Then I was in a hospital room, looking at myself from an odd upside-down angle in a gown. There was a doctor beside me with a baby in his hands, passing it over to me. As my hands took it, I tried to reach out to my reflection, finding a metallic mirror as a barrier. I punched it, warbling the entirety of the space I was in.

In the confusion of it all, a clear thought rang out to me. A recollection of sequences of three. I hit the mirror again, shaking the space even greater this time. I took a deep breath, unsure of what would come next. As hard as I could, I struck the mirror once more.

My surroundings shattered like glass, the world around me dividing like window panes and flying off and away from me. I was in a hallway, at the other end of it a mirror image of myself. I stepped towards it, but it stood still. I began running, but the hallway between us stretched on, keeping just beyond my reach. Stopping and trying to assess the space I was in, three knocks echoed in my mind. My reflection smiled as I stomped a foot down three times, catapulting me towards my doppelganger. My eyes grew wide as I launched into my own face.

Chapter 9

Mirrors

I shot up out of my slumber like a rocket, to find I was back in my bedroom. Was any of that real? Had I ever even left my apartment? I could remember being on the bus with a woman, before that I was at the store, and before that...

That thing, it had been stalking me. I could see it in my minds eye, like it was right in front of me. Then, the light all around me flickered. Not from a bulb or electric light source, but as if the sun itself sputtered out of existence. Everything went pitch dark for a fraction of a second, and when the world lit up again it was there. Standing at the foot of my bed pouring black shadows of itself, onto the floor and into the air, spreading like oil in water.

The walls seemed to bend as I stood up, compelled by the force of gravity pulling me into it. I refused to run or shy away from it this time. I was tired of hiding, I would face my fears, running head first as if to tackle the monster hiding in the dark.

I was falling. Down, down, down I went until I landed on my hands and knees. I felt something wet on the back of my neck, and then again like something were dripping onto me. Turning my head to look up, I saw a gaping maw closing in upon me, dripping dark, viscous saliva. The black ooze webbed over me like it was being strung along by an invisible spider, belting around as the teeth closed in.

It felt like I was wrapped in a blanket on a soft mattress, but I couldn't open my eyes. As I struggled to do so, the texture of the fabric became coarse, tightening more and more as I fought to open my eye lids to an almost suffocating pressure. I could scream if not for the lack of air, but with what felt like every fiber of my being I willed my eyes to open, feeling like I was tearing stitches that had sewn them shut.

I was standing in a hallway, mirrored walls showing a cascading image of myself rolling infinitely into oblivion. To my left and right, millions of myself looking back at me, a myriad of expressions on each of their faces.

After what could have been an eternity, they all looked ahead of where I was, and all our eyes landed upon the writhing mass of shadows on the other end of the hall. It stood there like a bull ready to charge a matador, huffing and puffing clouds that blot out the edges of its form.

The hallway shrank, the distance between us closing in to the point I could feel its breath billowing hot air over me. I looked straight into its eyes, the endless tornadoes of ebony storms coalescing into a singularity light-years away within its cosmic depths. I was being pulled in, soon to be devoured whole by the beast. My mind fracturing as it divided my being into digestible pieces, it took all I had to focus on a thought long enough to act upon it. Three knocks, every time it came and went there were three knocks. I could banish it from here if I could just muster the strength to move.

It was like trying to free myself from quicksand. I wrenched and twisted, dislocating my arms from my shoulders as I tugged my body to move, until finally I threw my fist into the mirror on the wall. With the first strike the glass shattered and the pieces floated away, suspended in the air around me. With another the very hallway itself splintered, and I thought I saw a smile crack across the creatures face. With a third and final thrust of my fist, everything fade to black. A hysterical laughter echoing maniacally. I was floating in a void, with nothing but that insidious laughter all around. A white light drew closer and closer like a train at the end of a tunnel, and as I was bathed in the light, I woke up.

Chapter 10

Damocles

A single ray of light shone through the window as the sun peaked into the clouds, landing right on me as I stir in the sheets. I opened my eyes with a yawn, a hefty breath of air filling my chest. I felt as though I had the most fantastic dream, but it was slipping through my fingers faster than I could recall it.

It felt odd, being in my apartment, like I was supposed to be somewhere else. What day was it anyway? I got up to check my phone and saw it was Sunday. Had I slept a whole day? I couldn't remember doing anything yesterday, I must have. I just remembered falling flat on my face into my bed Friday night. It had been such an exhausting week, I wasn't surprised that I slept through a whole day.

Nature called, demanding me to get out of bed and go to the bathroom. I stood, taking in the mess my room was. A pile of clothes on my desk chair and a pair of pants out on the floor in the hallway to the bathroom. I typically cleaned up after myself as I went, I must have really been out of it. I told myself I would clean it all tomorrow, that today I would just be a vegetable on the couch and watch cartoons or something. Turning on the shower and sitting on the toilet, I let the steam build up in the bathroom for awhile, just taking in the sound of the water as the mirror fogged up. It was too cloudy for me to tell my reflection was just a shadow, too sleepy eyed to be able to notice it standing still watching me as I got in the shower.

I wiped away the moisture on the mirror, ignoring the feeling of being watched as I brushed my teeth. My half-opened, dreary eyes looking back at me, still glazed over with forgotten dreams from the night before. The feeling that there was something I was forgetting haunted me like a ghost as I went to the kitchen. The smell of old spaghetti filled my living room, another sign of my apathetic state. The lingering haze in my brain only clearing to the thought of food as my stomach growled.

I opened the refrigerator door and grabbed two eggs out of the fresh dozen and cracked open the orange juice. Over easy eggs were the quickest road to sustenance, and I shoveled them down sitting on the couch watching Looney Tunes. With a full stomach the brain fog cleared and I shrugged off the anxious paranoia.

One of my last thoughts Friday was that I needed rest, and I certainly felt much better after a full day of rest. I remembered my boss giving me an extra day off, and before I had felt like it was a punishment but now appreciated it for what it was. Time off, to regroup myself and regain my composure. It was a vacation, which I never took. If I hadn't been going through a mental breakdown I might have traveled or something. I was, however, quite content to just sit on the couch in my underwear watching the road runner fool the coyote into running off the cliff for the hundredth time. It was so obviously a trap, and yet over and over again it was like the coyote forgot the trickery of the bird, running right back into the same canyon. I chuckled with a mouth full of food as I watched him plummet once again.

I sat there all day, until the window in my living room went dark from the setting sun. I had drifted off on the couch, ignorant to the looming penumbra standing in my living room watching me sleep. It walked around my apartment after I fully fell succumb to slumber, stepping in synchronization with the rise and fall of my chest. With each breath, it danced around my home, leaving smoke barrel rolling in its wake. It delighted itself as it looked in the mirror in my bathroom, taking in its own visage.

Hunkering down to my height, it concentrated its mass until the formless edges took on the likeness of a hazel eyed, red haired man. It leaned in closer to the mirror, focusing on different aspects until refining into my likeness. An ethereal laugh echoing out from itself, modulating its voice until it sounded like mine. It winked at itself in the mirror, seeming quite pleased with its work, before turning on its heel and walking out my front door as I lay snoring on the couch.

1oq8xod,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1oq8xod/one_last_try_i_keep_restarting_every_morning/,One last try - I keep restarting every morning. Struggling with binge eating and long days.,"I have been struggling with binge eating since Fall 2022 and I have gained about 10 kg since then. My weight keeps going up and down. This year, for example, I went from 69 kg down to 63 kg and then back up to 67 kg between August and now.  
For reference: I am 162 cm and I felt most comfortable around 54 kg.

I am very familiar with calorie tracking and I do not struggle with accuracy. Every kilogram I gained makes sense. The challenge is staying in a deficit long enough to see change. Every morning I wake up calm, motivated, and convinced that today will be different. By evening, I lose control.

I have tried so many approaches: strict deficits, gentler deficits, exercise with more calories, volume eating, “eat what I love but in moderation.” The result is always the same: without a consistent deficit, one binge erases the week. I know from experience that I lose weight around \~1100 calories per day on average. I have had full blood work done, including hormones, and everything is normal.

My days are long (8 am to 1 am). I take 8 courses and I am performing at the top of my class. I feel like food is the thing that keeps me going emotionally and mentally.

My meals are structured:

* Breakfast: iced coffee with skim milk (\~100 cal) + protein bar (\~250 cal)
* Lunch: chicken or steak sandwich with vegetables (\~550 cal)

The issue begins when I get home. I change into comfortable clothes and I try not to rush to the fridge (which used to be my automatic habit). I try to slow down and be mindful. But the moment the appetite opens, I go for whatever is in the fridge: grilled cheese, pasta, chicken and rice, anything that is cooked. And I always have my binge trigger foods in the house: lotus spread, halva, peanut butter, chocolate, mixed nuts, dates. I keep thinking I should learn to coexist with them, but right now I just binge on them. I live with my family and they are supportive of me btw.

When I am in a deficit, I cannot sleep. I get wired and mentally alert at night. Then the next day I am exhausted and vulnerable to bingeing again. When I binge, I can physically feel my thighs gain softness and I immediately feel uncomfortable in my body. It is a very fast mental and emotional shift.

What makes this harder is the comparison I constantly see around me. Those girls who sit in class with a lightweight backpack and sip on coffee all day, barely eating, still sharp, still functioning, still slim. I cannot convince my brain that I can be one of them. I believe I will faint. I believe I will lose my cognitive capacity. And that fear keeps me from maintaining a deficit when I need to.

I keep waiting for a calmer period in life to fix this, but realistically there will never be a completely calm period. I graduate in June 2026 and I do not want to spend these years uncomfortable.

I am aware CBT exists, and I know some people benefit from therapy. But I want to be honest: I tend to analyze therapists instead of participating. I catch the structure of their questioning and mentally “solve” their approach rather than letting it help me. This is another issue I am not looking to unpack here, but I want to acknowledge it upfront.

I do not know if this post will hold me accountable. I just want to feel like myself again.

If anyone has been in this position — long academic days, high performance, food as emotional and mental fuel — how did you break the binge cycle? How did you learn to trust yourself around food again?",1,1762458570.0,loseit,5,0.67,False
1oq8xe3,https://www.reddit.com/r/penpals/comments/1oq8xe3/25f_looking_for_penpals_anywhere/,[25/F] Looking for penpals anywhere!,"Hi! I'm a 25 y/o female in the PNW seeking my first long-term penpal of any age or gender. I love philosophy, art, and just human connection in general. I’m okay with email, but I really prefer snail mail—I have super cute handwriting, and I find it a shame not to use it in a digital age ;)

I’m seeking a penpal because I think this could be a fun new hobby. I want someone who can see the good in the world but also think about the bad parts critically, but still with a bit of hope. I’m seeking someone real and honest about themselves and their interests. I loathe cringe culture; I’m looking for a pal who also embraces the differences in every person.

Right now, I wanna try writing a trashy romantasy novel. In general, I love to write. I’m a bit of a serial hobby-hopper. I love country swing and line dancing, and most recently have been getting into waltz and two step.

I’m super into early 2000s romance animes like Ouran or Fruits Basket. I’ve got a pet frog and a cat and I’m currently working on Marie Kondo-ing my space. I’m a little interested in astrology, but admittedly, I don’t know quite enough to be passionate about it. I love to cook; maybe we could exchange recipes?

As far as music, I’m all over the place. I love EDM, indie, and pop, mostly. My favorite artists are Between Friends, Fall Out Boy, Elina, and Marvin Gaye. I’m chill with K-Pop, but I wouldn’t say I stan any specific groups besides maybe Twice or SNSD.

I usually spend my time hanging out with my friends. We love to hit coffee shops, hike, or go soak up the sun at wineries. If I’m not hanging out with my friends, I’m probably hanging out at the zoo, working on my book, or working on my Stardew Valley farm.

Thanks u/Theorev for sending me additional images!

I found that if you peel off one of the paper layers of corrugated cardboard the remaining piece will easily go around curves. I glued the loose sheet back on at the end, which makes the resulting structure quite strong.

The rock pillars are paper mache, the bridge is made of coffee stirring sticks.

Three of the tall pieces sit on cardboard cubes that can be removed and folded up. It all fits in a small paper bag, easy for storage and travel (and also for bringing it out piece by piece as the adventurers explore).

Actually no. Space is neither hot nor cold... mostly. Heat energy transfer best through a medium and thus a vacuum is not great a moving heat along a gradient. In fact heat management is one of the biggest issues of any long term space habitation. 

So onto my question. Astronaut A leaves the ISS with a sealed thermos of piping heat coffee. We are talking a proper 60's vacuum glass lined thermos; not the modern kind that bleed heat out of a few hours. Anyway, Astronaut A decides for giggles stake unseal his might vintage thermo during his space walk and tosses the contents out. -it wasn't very good coffee anyway- Other than forming a liquid sphere of coffee, what happens?



I get that good portion immediately starts to evaporate. The last of air pressure dramatically boiling point after all. That rapid expansion cools it somewhat. I know that some heat energy is lost as infrared radiant energy. But how quickly should it take to freeze? Hollywood would have us believe that is should be near instant but we all know at least a little better.

First day back this girl starts talking to me. She was curious about the college I go to and we connected over both being in school. Over the weeks we continue to talk and eventually I get the balls to get her socials and ask her to hangout outside of work. She says yes and we get coffee, it went great and she said she’d wanna hangout again. 

Once I started texting her outside of work the conversation literally never ended. She would put in just as much effort as I did when texting. We would talk about everything and she quickly became best friends. I knew I was getting feelings, but I was uncertain about her. She told me a-lot about her personal life, openly told me I became one of the few people she texted everyday, told her family about me and we even flirted a bit. She became so comfortable with me she literally told me about her body if you catch my drift, she even said she never told people about that except past partners. Every time i came into work she came up to me before I clocked in and we talked. It was great.

I have self sabotaging tendencies and I couldn’t believe she would like me based on her past boyfriends, I am not her type at all. I started planning my escape, I thought university would separate us but it only brought us closer. Things got a bit flirty and she said she missed me. This really threw me over the edge and I crashed out. A few days later we’re hanging out and I ask her if she ever thought I liked her, she said at one point but not anymore. And for whatever reason I say to her, i thought I did but I never thought about sleeping with you. This upset her understandably and asks for a break. She said I needed to get over her and that is the only way.

About a week later I ask her to block me because I wanted to completely move on. She didn’t want to but did. That’s where everything settled in. She’s gone, I gone fucked up. I tried to move on and it was okay after one week but then my friend ran into her at a party. When drunk my coworker tells my friend she loves me and cares about me so much. Either this meant I was so deep in the friendzone or she actually liked me. I had my friend text her asking her to unblock me, she said she’d think about it. She decided to not and asked for me to continue to respect the space which I’m doing.

I have not been the same person since. I lost a perfectly good friend possible girlfriend due to a fear of rejection. I’ve tried talking to other girls but it just doesn’t feel the same. I’ve restarted therapy and actively want to stop self sabotaging, I still am here or there but damn it’s crazy how much a single person can influence your life. Since going back to school she’ll work one or two days a week and I heard she stopped talking to basically anyone, but she did talk to our mutual friend who’s a coworker. She does still care about me, she told my friend she woudn’t cause any issues at work and I already told her I woudn’t either. It just sucks man, I deserve to lose this great friend but she didn’t deserve to get hurt again. She has already gotten hurt by so many other people, I told myself I woudn’t be one of them but here we are. I’m a fucking loser. 

  
I have to see her in a few weeks. I'm planning on not saying a word to her unless I have to but sometimes i wish I could sit her down and just explain myself because I found out so much within these last two months. ",1,1762458171.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

1oq8p2e,https://i.redd.it/ttrcsvwkwozf1.jpeg,The end of an era,"I had to join so I could post about this. My mother is alive and fine, just upset. 

My mother first started playing Adopt Me in 2019. She used it as a way to have fun and “hang out” with her 5 grandchildren in a fun virtual world. She played daily, especially when any of the kids were online as well. She got to a point where she wanted to keep her login streak alive. She was very proud of it, and her grandkids would often say she should try to look into whether she had the longest active streak ever for the game and “get it in the records books.” 😂 she could not tell me the exact count other than her streak recently passed 2300 days in the game. I don’t know if that is any kind of record, but if not at the top, I’m sure she was close to it. 

Unfortunately, that streak is going to end today. When she got on her iPad with her morning coffee today, she went to open the game and somehow she was logged out of Roblox. She attempted to login multiple times and it was no use. She tried to reset the password, but she never got the code in her email. I tried to assist, but it proved futile. She tried multiple times to contact Roblox support, but she repeatedly received a form response that they could not do anything and she can create a new account. 

I wish there was more I could do to help, but more than likely she never tied the game to the proper recovery methods that she should have. It may have been tied to an old deactivated email account from an old ISP. She’s old and not tech savvy enough to know certain things needed to be backed up. She never paid for robux, so there is no kind of purchase history, just her years of hatching and raising pets and sharing them with her grandkids. 

Obviously, I’m not expecting anything from this post. I just wanted to share one of the many examples of these fun little games bridging the gaps between multiple generations and allowing a grandmother to spend some extra quality time with her grandchildren. 

I guess I could pose the question. Does anyone know who has/had the longest streak? What’s everyone’s current streak? ",1,1762458025.0,AdoptMeRBX,3,1.0,False

There’s a guy…at work. I know, I know. We spoke when I joined the company a year ago. I don’t remember all the details as I spoke with many people when I joined. He always smiles and seems pleasant. 

We work in the same unit but separate teams so our work lives don’t cross unless it’s non-project calls eg if the unit’s director has a meeting with everyone or if we do drinks for the entire unit (this happens maybe twice a year - summer and Christmas). We work on the same floor so if we’re both in office we see each other. He sits close to my work friend so usually when I stop to chat with my friend, I’m looking right at him. 

Anyway, I’ve started taking more notice of him - largely because I am open to having a longterm partner and I’m not on dating apps. He’s a handsome man and well, the smiles have been reeling me in. I added him on LinkedIn one day then as I was passing his desk, he did the usual smile and I told him I added him. I know, that’s my move 😂

The next day after he’d accepted my request, he sent me a Teams message asking what the initial stands for in my name. I use an initial for my first name eg M. Kimberley Brown. I then joked I’d blow my cover if I told him and that we can grab coffee when next in office for the big reveal. He said he thought Kimberley was my first name and that he had asked another colleague who “Berley Berley” is in the work FPL table and that the other colleague said it was me. He then said if he has to bribe me with coffee to find out so be it. 

We finally had a 25-min coffee chat today (a week after that Teams exchange) and we had a great chat. He actually remembered the first chat we had when I joined the company. We spoke about work a bit and what we each did before joining the company. But it wasn’t all work. We joked around about FPL and how horribly I’m doing - he also knew who I captained last gameweek which means he checked my team. We learned each other’s ages and birthdays - he’s a year older than I am. He told me where he’s from and why he loves living in London. 

Then the convo ended abruptly because we both had to head to other meetings. It ended with him saying the type of music he likes. And I went “Ouu, I want to hear more” and he said it was a good chat and we should do it again.

So obviously I’m now thinking…what next? We ran into each other a number of times for the rest of the day and I’ve been thinking about him since. I am thinking to wait and see if he reaches out or says something when we next run into each other in office. Or worst case, I could make an appearance at the unit’s Christmas party and hope we can chat there so I can assess if he’s just being polite or there’s something more. 

I couldn’t tell from the coffee chat if he has a partner - all he said was part of the reason he loves London is his friends are here. 

TLDR: I like a guy at work - we had a coffee chat and spoke about work and a bit about personal life but chat ended abruptly. Unsure if there’s something there or he’s just being a friendly coworker. Should I reach out or wait and see if he does?",2,1762457558.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

1oq8g60,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1oq8g60/my_27f_friend_and_coworker_37f_invites_me_to/,My (27F) friend and coworker (37F) invites me to family activities over inviting her boyfriend?,"I (27F) have been close friends with my coworker “Georgina” (37F) for about three years. She’s straight, has a long-term boyfriend, and two young kids under 5.

I’m single, don’t really like kids, and I’m openly lesbian.

She’s usually pretty private, but over time she’s opened up to me a lot about her life, her kids, and her relationship. Her children know me by name and she talks about me to them all the time. I’ve gone out with them a few times, like to cafés or playing tennis together, and most recently I went trick-or-treating with them.

She doesn’t have a lot of free time outside her kids, but they always seem to be involved when I’m around even though I know she meets other friends without them.

Here’s where it gets confusing. She told me she wouldn’t take her kids trick-or-treating unless I went. It was their first time, and she said she felt a little embarrassed because English isn’t her first language and she wasn’t sure what to say at the doors, even though she’s basically fluent. I’d already told her what to say, but she still wanted me there. Her boyfriend was at home, but we went together.

The night was really sweet, but it also felt kind of intimate. At one point she asked her son, “Who do you want to go with, Mummy or Luce?” (me). Later she said she really enjoyed it and wants to do it again next year, and that I could come over to do her and the kids’ Halloween makeup next time.

At work, people always comment on how close we are. We take coffee breaks together, tease each other, have nicknames for each other, and there’s a lot of eye contact that people notice. She’s told me she doesn’t like her boyfriend, sometimes compares him to me, and even jokes that she’s my type. She’s also physically playful, like sneaking up behind me and pulling my hair, then pretending it wasn’t her. People gossip about us and we’re both aware of it. But whenever we bring it up she just says, “So?”

One time I said, “What happens to your kids when you die?” and she said her kids would have “Luuuuce” (said in her kid’s voice). It was lighthearted, but it made me stop and think. She’s said things before like one of her kids is “your baby girl,” and we refer to them as “the kiddies.” She knows I don’t like kids but always says, “But you like miiiiine.”

Recently we talked about how her boyfriend treats her. He told her to “learn English better,” and she said to me that she wanted to reply, “Fine, I’ll learn English with my private teacher.” The “private teacher” is me. This is an ongoing joke between us, since I help her with English and she teases me about being a bad influence for teaching her slang. I told her maybe she was being too harsh on him and should be nicer to someone she cares about. She said, “Arron? I don’t care about Arron! I’ll learn English and he can fuck off.”

I told her that I noticed them arguing once when I was at her house, and she said, “Yeah, you should have told him to shut the fuck up.”

She also keeps telling me that her kids miss me and are always asking, “When can we see Lucy? Are we going to Lucy’s house?”

I’ve realized I’ve developed a big crush on her in the last couple of months. I really care about her and her kids, but the closeness has started to feel confusing. I also feel kind of out of place, like I’ve overstepped. I don’t want to intrude, but I’m not sure where the line actually is anymore. I don’t know if I’m just misreading things because of my feelings or if there’s actually something mutual happening. Either way, I want to be respectful.

TL;DR:
My (27F) straight friend and coworker (37F) with a boyfriend and kids keeps blurring the line between friendship and something more. I’ve developed a crush on her, but I don’t want to intrude on her relationship or overstep. I can’t tell if I’m just reading too much into things or if there’s something romantic going on. How do I step back without making things weird at work or damaging the friendship?

I was homeless in Nebraska since May and my aunt up here had a spare bed so I moved away from everyone and everything. I detoxed fully and I now have a good job with benefits and everything. I'm waiting for my first paycheck.

I had signed up for MN SNAP when I got here because I had lost my NE SNAP and didnt want a fraud charge. I had SNAP for September and Oct.

I feel like without that first paycheck and no SNAP that im being a fiscal burden on my elderly aunt who needs to eat herself. We usually only drink coffee for breakfast and we always have at least sandwiches for supper. Fortunately I work in a kitchen and get lunches at no charge.

It's not having lunches on my days off I need some help with. A sandwich supper never fills me up and by 11p my stomach is rumbling again. I can stand to lose the weight. Alcohol abuse caused me to gain 75lbs. I dont think I'll die from hunger but its really hard to feel comfortable or like a worthy human with tummy rumbles.

I dont know where to go. Food pantries? Or even restaurants that will help SNAP card holders with a hot meal? Is there a website with this info? Google is next to useless now. Back home we have a group of friendly anarcho-communists that feed the people that need a free hot meal.

We now have a baby, and I’m still figuring out how to talk about it.","I met my husband when I was 23, working my first real job at a design magazine in New York. He’s in that world too, came in for an interview, what was supposed to be a quick Q&A turned into a long conversation.

He emailed afterward to thank me, then sent a book rec, then another. It turned into late-night talks, coffee meetups, and before I knew it, it was something.

He was just turning 60, divorced. I was just starting out. Somehow it balanced.
Five years later, we’re married, splitting time between New York and Europe, and have a little girl.

I get how it might sound, but living it feels different. He’s funny, gentle, endlessly curious. He treats me as an equal. We share a love of architecture, travel, and food. People stare sometimes, or assume things. I used to care more. Now I mostly just try to focus on the life we’re actually building.

Sometimes I still feel shy talking about it, but finding this sub reminded me that love doesn’t always follow a script, and that’s okay.

1oq8cz3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1oq8cz3/aita_for_wanting_to_break_up/,AITA for wanting to break up,"So I’ve always wanted to meet someone organically as it feels more natural and not rushed. I met this guy and we talked on chat and calls for a bit before actually meeting. We vibed instantly, but also I have a very outgoing and friendly personality so I do talk to everyone easily, but he did seem different and nice from the rest as well so I liked him initially. 
I’m 25F, he’s 6 months younger. 

Then later after a few weeks of talking when we met, each time he bought me flowers. 
Now the problems start when he asked if I wanna have sex that night, and I said “I don’t have sex with just friends” to give him the hint that he has to ask me out as well (since we had been going out for a 2-3 weeks but hadn’t officially made it clear). That night itself he asked me out (even though it was his plan all along I believe) but in my head, the timing was so dependent on what I had said. Then again that night itself, after asking me out, he asked if I wanna have sex with him, and I said “no, I wanna wait till we’re comfortable” and he said - he’s comfortable so why not, so I said - I wanna take some time, and he just kept asking “why, so I can get more clarity and understanding”, and that felt like a very awkward conversation to have. I told him it was too fast and I wanna wait it out to see if he’s not there just for sex, and he got really really upset and angry. Pre context of this is, he had not gone down on me even once, while he had received alot of bjs and came multiple times, so to me it just seemed unfair to directly rush into sex. Eventually in that conversation I did tell him the above as well more softly so it doesn’t come out rude but it was a very awk convo to have honestly from my end since I’ve never had to have this convo before. 

Then, he also seems to think about himself more than he thinks of others, and I am more of a giving person, like I do like to care of the people close to me and just do anything for them to make them happy. But this guy doesn’t seem that and that also bothers me a bit. 

One time he asked me to come to a place which would be close to where he’s going, so when he gets free we can have coffee there. Sounds fine, but it was 15 kms away from my house and would have taken me 1 hr to reach just to have coffee with him? And then he had to go somewhere else, so it’s not like we could’ve spent the remaining time together. Just have coffee and leave?? And later he anyway had to come close to my area itself so he could have offered to meet somewhere there but no?

And not even a single time he has offered to pay the bill. Whenever the bill comes, I pay him instantly the split. But in my head I thought - okay we are dating now so we can do 1 place me, 1 place him. I ended up paying in 3 places consecutively and he didn’t pay me back. I didn’t ask thinking he will pay someplace else. I let him pay someplace else and he goes like - btw I got the split from the place we had gone to so can you pay me. And he had ordered wine from Goa (Goa is supposed to be super cheap with alcohol) and we had thought we can have it together but we hadnt opened it yet. So he was asking me the split of all (which would have been less than what he owed me for the 3 places) so he could’ve left the asking for money thing also if he wanted to since he owed me for a while and I didn’t ask. But he chose to ask, so I also balanced out mine and it turned out to be equal. But he could’ve done it mentally that oh I’ve paid here, she has paid there blah blah. That’s what I do because I don’t wanna owe anyone any money so I clear it that time itself or make sure next time I cover it up properly. But is that not a norm? 

Now the good things are- 1. He gets me flowers each time we meet. 
2. He is caring in terms of what I did in a day he would ask me. 
3. He makes good plans of going out to a restaurant to eat. 
4. He is also punjabi, so am I so we do vibe 
5. He looks attractive
6. For my birthday when we had in fact just met once, he got me a bracelet, small tiny minimalistic one but that’s so sweet!??
7. Each time he gets me flowers, he writes a note in it. The note can be very simple but that’s also sweet 
8. He tells me whatever I feel like is wrong, I can tell him and he’ll fix it in himself 
9. He’s a great boyfriend - makes plans, pampers 

Bad things - 1. he doesn’t seem v warm natured 
2. I see a lot of narcissistic traits 
3. His family is based in Kolkata and I’m from Gurgaon, so I’m thinking from marriage perspective it might be a problem later idk?
4. I ideally wanted someone with good health, he has diabetes hereditary so he may get it. Which honestly is fine by me, but I wanted my kid to have a good health genes and thinking from that perspective it scares me. Since I have good health touchwood 
5. His father and father’s side have hair baldness issue. So he is going to be bald when he gets older as well. He’s 25 now and I can already see 
6. He also mentioned he has some family issues that he didn’t mention what it was 


Now I feel I have been out of dating culture since 2 years, so I may be missing out on something’s or would’ve forgotten how it’s done, so pls remind me and let me know if I’m doing something wrong too. But I do feel this is not it, right? There’s something wrong with it. Pls tell me AITAH for wanting to breakup since he doesn’t give me husband vibes? But he’s a great boyfriend! What to do?

Over the last 9 months, I’ve gone through more than 600 coffees across 35 roasters.

Right now, the subscription is $36.36 ($6 shipping included). But honestly, I’ve been losing money on every order because I’ve been putting in wild, high-end coffees similar to the à la carte lineup.

I’ve got a ton of ideas for where to take this next, but I want to see how many hundreds of people are genuinely interested first.

Different tiers aren’t an option yet there just aren’t enough subscribers to make that work.

My first thought is to cut off 1 coffee, so it would be to just raise the price about $7-9 bucks, 2 towards shipping and 6-7 /4 coffees.

I think i have to go back to bagging in house to keep the flow and momentum. Requiring roasters to do it just took too much time and coordination if they’re unwilling to do so. 

Another option is to ship in 100g bags of 3 coffees, but then im in the same threshold as other similar subscription.

Pictures 1-4 are the room, as it currently is - green, and as the tenants before last had it - off white. The fireplace, and two doors off the room are dark wood. I'm not sure what colour to do the walls since the wood is dark already and the fireplace tiles are green. 

Picture 5 is the size of the room. 

Pictures 6-9 are looks I like. I like eclectic, cozy, vintage looks. 

Picture 10 is my current desk and picture 11 is the round wooden dining table and small coffee table I can get for free from family member. 

I'm not sure where to start, but the first decision that needs to be made is painting since the landlord wants to do that soon. I don't want to go with plain white since this is a rare opportunity to do something different with a rental. Would one darker accent wall plus three lighter walls prevent it from being too dark?

Born and raised in deep east Texas, but have lived in Houston, Dallas, and austin for the last 8 years. I want to move for a change of environment, new experiences, and maybe better opportunities or lifestyle fit. But I’m really struggling with two big things: deciding where to go and how to handle the emotional side of leaving.

I’m close-ish with my family, and all of them live here. My relatives are getting older, and I’m the only one who’s even considering moving away. I feel this heavy guilt about leaving, like I’d be abandoning them or missing out on precious time, especially with my grandparents who helped raise me when my mom was sick when i was a child. But at the same time, I can’t shake the feeling that I’m ready (and maybe even need) to experience something different for myself.

To make things more complicated, I’d be doing this solo. I don’t have a partner, nor do I have friends anywhere else im considering moving to, and as an extrovert, that thought really scares me. I love being around people and feeling connected.

How do you decide where to move when you’re open to different possibilities but unsure what’s best? For further info, I'm a 27F, liberal, attorney. I have two dogs.

1oq82wp,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1oq82wp/was_that_bpd_my_coworker/,Was that BPD my coworker?,"Hi all.

I'm a lady in her 30-s. My coworker is a lady in her 50-s. There was an accident at work where she had to defend me from an attack of a crazy one (bullying). I never asked her to come to my help, but she did (she is a manager in a way). 

She gave a great speech. She stood for all the good things, for comradery and respect. She is a lil crazy, and I knew it. She screamed sometimes (for no reason) and I saw her have a terrible anxiety attack at least once, she was barely breathing (someone was trash-talking her in whispers and she couldn't leave. Some people think she's nuts, and I was sure she was batshit until that day she stood up for me.

I heard her speech and I melted. I thought she was beautiful inside, just going through hard times. She spoke of suicide once, just droppped it in convo, nothing personal. I'm an empath, I fell for her completely that day. I hated that my previous opinion of her was very low. She defended me and then got bullied harshly by two other coworkers harshly, they pointed fingers at her. She never came to me to ask for warmth and friendship, but next time she saw me she screamed to my face ""where have you been!!"" *while she was being bullied. Later she would come around and drop lil things to  my ear, like ""I had to go to church"" (bullying affected her), ""I was so miserable, they pointed fingers"". I thought she tried to connect with me.

I was devastated. I really fell for her and realised I've been a lesbian my whole life. Just a coincidence that she helped me understand it (I'm reading a lot of Jung and trying to find my real self). I realised my first ever crush at school was a girl and that men were always like bros to me. I cried a lot. I really knew I was a lesbian now. I was so grateful to her for this, and I was madly infatuated. I found her phone number and messaged her. She is avoidant and has panic attacks, so I asked her to hang out at a coffee shop next to work before asking her on a real date. I bought her a gift and asked if I could bring her a gift. She said yes. She messaged me back, she was weird, she tried to ""test"" me in different ways so I could prove myself not to be a scammer (wut lol), not to be a rumor spreader and a snitch. She was paranoid. Of course I'm not. She gave me tonns of compliments, like what a great dress and how smart I was. All in all, she never cut the communication big way.

Yes, I wanted a relationship with her. I saw she was like me in many ways (autism). The relationship didn't have to be romantic, it could have been anything, I just wanted to have her in my life. Bring her gifts, make her day. Whatever she says, just to know she's okay. I cared for her, she was my first ""woman love"", you know. I never told her. I never wanted to pressure. I just wanted her like a soul, maybe later if she says ""yes"", but for now - anything. She looked unhappy. 

So we met. And she stormed off after the first minutes seeing me. She started running away after she asked a silly question like ""how much is the bus with your discount card?"", and I said ""I don't know"", loll. I brought her the gift that I put all my heart and time into, so I followed her and gave it to her. She screamed at me that she didn't need a 3rd kid, maybe if something else, but no, something else no too cause she had kids. She stormed off. At the same time she was dropping hints that she wanted to go to the park with me (take me out?). Two opposite things - push and pull in a minute. I was so confused. I just wanted to make her feel appreciated. She was cruel. I never messaged her after, but I saw with the corner of my eye how she looked at me at work since. So much passion. But at the same time the minute she sees me there, she runs away. I think she's spreading a rumor that I'm a stalker (lolll, I'm like a gorgeous looking lady). I never followed her anywhere, I just needed to give that gift. This whole situation just irks me. I really fell for her deeply. I think she drove her husband to suicide (hints) earlier. I think she talked to bosses saying that I'm a stalker cause they were giving me hard times. But I stood through, and she not so well. I see her a few months later sometimes, she changed for the worse (lookwise), she looks so sad and empty, dissociated, like a ghost. Many people at work think she's not so well in the head. Bosses probably laugh at her for thinking I'm a stalker (she's paranoid).

I don't know what that was, but that broke my heart for a while. She was my ""first"" and I saw how bad she was. I just wanted to cheer her up, people do that to me sometimes and I am always grateful.

Our apartment was VERY obviously haunted. 

The windows would open and shut on their own, posters and pictures would randomly fall and turn on the walls , the tv would randomly switch channels , and the door to my parents room would constantly slam shut

 (extremely loud! I still remember the sound)

My sister told me when we were younger that she would see a woman walking in our hallway and sometimes sitting in the chair.

Which was crazy because my mom tried to get the house blessed , and invited some people over to pray. One of the woman who was praying told my mom that there was a woman living in our house. 

(Sadly this prayer lady died a little after)

They asked the spirit to leave but it didn’t of course. 

I would have very scary nightmares , and feel the presence of someone watching me in my room. My sister felt the same thing…

I would hear voices in the house sometimes it would be my mom’s voice calling my name when she wasn’t there. 

Though I never seen the woman , I did see what looked to be a man. 

I was taking a shower and seen a huge (above 6ft) shadow figure walk past the curtains. I remember saying “mom , dad?” I wasn’t scared and continued showering as I assumed it was one of my parents. Then I heard shuffling in the cabinets as if someone was looking for something. 

I turned off the shower and peaked through the curtains but nobody was there. Being a kid though I still thought it was my parents. When I got out the bathroom I went to my parents room (they were both on their bed) I asked if they came into the bathroom and of course they did not. 

I told them about what I saw but they didn’t have much of a reaction and told me not to be scared. 

A few months later , they told my sister and I that the person who lived in the apartment before us was an old man who had a heart attack (I believe) and died in the bath tub. They said they didn’t tell us because they didn’t want to scare us. 

Now looking back at it , I heard the bathroom open but I never heard it close. 

When I peaked through the curtain though the bathroom door was closed (meaning it never actually opened)…

We’ve moved now and no longer stay in Oregon

 (probably the most haunted state I’ve ever lived in , I have sooo many stories)

And the apartment building has been turned into a coffee shop. 

I honestly wonder if anyone has experienced any hauntings in the shop. If you live in Portland go to 1724 NE Alberta , Roseline Coffee shop and let me know haha ",1,1762456618.0,Paranormal_Evidence,0,1.0,False

AH = Austro-Hungarian empire

K.u.K. = The AH's state railway.

The AH Panzerzugs used Roman numeral designations. 

Much can and has been said about the problems and failures of the Austro-Hungarian military in ww1, however they did make some SEXY armoured trains, many of which saw significant post war service under new ownership.

So let's start first with the original beautiful Austro-hungarian Panzerzugs. Broadly speaking, they had 3 types: the improvised types, and later on the Light and Heavy Panzerzugs which where high quality factory builds ordered after the need for armoured trains became clear on the eastern front.

The borderlands between the AH and Russian Empire was very poor and often deliberately underdeveloped due to its status as a buffer zone between the AH and Russian Empires. Due to the much smaller population density and much less developed infrastructure everything on the eastern front was much more dependent on railways or rivers to get anywhere or do anything especially in large numbers. 

The wide open sparsely inhabited spaces with limited rail networks also meant that the trench warfare that made armored trains useless on the western front failed to develop and a war of mobility was the rule, with huge amounts of territory traded regularly as armies advanced and retreated, generally following either the railways or rivers for obvious logistical purposes.

This in turn meant that capturing train stations was very important and major battles frequently revolved around them. These battles often started with an armoured train storming into a station with guns blazing. 

To prove better protection and mobility for troops on the railways, especially in the partisan riddled Baltic's and Italian fronts, improvised trains were built by railroad engineering companies using whatever was on hand. One of the first was ""Captain Shumans"" train, named after it's designer. The success of these units let to state orders for more impressive factory built models. 

The one main problem that the AH panzerzugs had was their terrible underpowered 377.116 locomotives, meaning that in most trains, these locomotives had to be paired up, complicating operations.

SO: first some photos of the Austro-Hungarian panzerzugs of the three categories:

[ Panzerzug X, Tarvis Tarvisio, Italian Front, 21 May 1916.  One of the original more improvised Panzerzugs built by railroad engineers at a local depot. it had no artillery armament and relied completely on the rifles and MGs of the infantry it carried for firepower.](https://preview.redd.it/x58ii5eycozf1.jpg?width=1680&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ff8790f3fec54444d3ae89e7787208e9b5f08684)

The improvised armoured trains proved effective but lacked real firepower and their home spun designs were less efficient. However the K.u.K. made some truly beautiful panzerzugs all with integrated artillery. The surprisingly futuristic streamlined design of the ""light"" panzerzugs their artillery had a limited firing arc as can be seen. Both designs used the same style of infantry/machinegun wagon.

[ this is an \\""Light Panzerzug\\""  Panzerzug II in Kolomea 1916 photo credit: Ulster Irish ](https://preview.redd.it/mjr1my84dozf1.jpg?width=1978&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=235136cc33ee9e4023c923010da00ef592dc28e4)

and the much more steampunk looking riveted rail battleships the ""Shwere Panzerzug"" or heavy armoured trains that were armed with 75mm guns as standard in turrets with much wider firing arcs on unique looking artillery cars at each end of the train. 

[Austro-Hungarian Shwere Panzerzug No. VIII, these were the more powerfully armed of the two main types of panzerzug.](https://preview.redd.it/ch7eyz16dozf1.jpg?width=920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7dc50f7da0b1dd8181dac6cd2d677be0e2a27a79)

and the self-propelled coffee pot looking contraption known as the ""MotorKannonWagon"" which was almost always seen with Pz No. IX  in photos

[close up of the Shobet Motorkannonwagen](https://preview.redd.it/g3sk89zvoozf1.png?width=978&format=png&auto=webp&s=427b404944a75239580c8878e753c781254c7288)

Anyways now unto some of their known fates after the empire was broken up:

Hungaria: Hungaria got a mixed bag of the more improvised units such as PZ No. Ix and it's MotorKannonWagon with some of the state designed trains. 

Some were modernized and went on to live a surprisingly long life despite being stuck with the underperforming 377.116 locomotives.

Czechoslovak Republic (not the Czeck and Slovak legion, the guys who ruled the Trans-Siberian). 

They got mostly the light panzerzugs:

[This one seen unfortunately after capture by Nazi Germany. Czeckslovak republic armoured trains are easily identified by a distinct three color splinter como schem. the design of the artillery car is essentially unchanged.](https://preview.redd.it/rv5gdetiqozf1.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6d21102216ed8150e568cb950fed32c372e406a)

Poland: probably the most famous and well photographed former Ah Panzerzug was SMIAŁY a former Shwer Panzerzug.

[front half of P.P. No. 2 SMIAŁY with the crew, no locomotive as far as i can tell. The platforms are from an Austro-Hungarian heavy armoured train.](https://preview.redd.it/7cblb51k4ozf1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7ffc7738567386e1ea8190c5b71f5a16fe2b1fce)

[P.P. No. 2 SMIAŁY with an odd looking tank locomotive, the more improvised wagons can be seen on the left side.](https://preview.redd.it/cv0m9wrw4ozf1.jpg?width=2579&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eb438f947ea317ecf6a579e8fff657901195aee7)

[same photo from further away, giving a better view of the safety wagon carrying rails.](https://preview.redd.it/o9la2p5g5ozf1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=60c2076dd0720a79b8d89ff2172186ba2ca84cf3)

what makes these photos so interesting is that it shows in very good detail the front cars, a infantry/MG wagon and modified artillery wagon from a former Austro-Hungarian ""Shwerer Panzerzug"". However more interesting are the other platforms behind the locomotive, which are clearly of a more improvised character. Given that Poland inherited two complete Austrian ""Shwerer-Panzerzugs"" it is safe to say they split the better quality cars from those trains up among their other more improvised units to spread them around more instead of concentrating it all in just two trains. 

[the quite odd looking P.P. No. 1 Piłsudczyk - Sept 1920, with a polish built 122mm artillery platform.

August, 2015



Golden sweet corn rained onto my tray with a salty butter shine. Green beans dipped  into their shallow pool of chicken broth, garlic, diced onion, and bacon. The beans made their presence known with a mouthwatering steam. A mound of potatoes plopped onto the tray and was pressed into a caldera with the back end of the cook's spoon. The divot was filled till it overflowed with a heavenly brown gravy. Last came the pork. A pork with the tenderness of a pudding and the taste of Hawaiian basted honey. Each cut of meat was so fresh it caused rumors that the meat was butchered in the kitchen. I believed them too. Lunch was the best part of St. Jude Catholic School. Unfortunately, it was followed by the worst.



Once our bellies were stuffed to the brim we were banished to the school yard for recess. Fresh cut grass poisoned the air. Summer still burned at the beginning of the school year and the sun blasted a bright sting to the back of my eyes. The day wasn’t made for me. My days were when it rained and we could go to the library to enjoy the silence while the talking boys released their energy into the gym. But days like this were ruled by the talking boys. They squealed and screeched as kick balls and whiffle balls torpedoed through the air. The other girls that weren’t interested in joining the boys usually huddled by the school building telling jokes and updating each other on the latest gossip. I would listen with my back to them. Whenever I heard something especially juicy I would sign my response close to my chest so they didn’t see. I wished I could turn and share all of the gossip I overheard, the benefits of not being noticed. I knew Darren found his dad's booze and planned to bring a bottle to school that week. I knew Bianca got into it with her mom the night before because she was failing math. I imagined they would get a kick out of that. Maybe they'd even be my friend if they understood me but they wouldn't, no one would.



The school yard became unusually quiet. A group of boys huddled at the fence that separated us from the woods. What they saw captured their attention and sewed their mouths shut, at least until they scurried away to giggle in small groups. Not all of them were so amused with the subject beyond the fence. Most looked confused but some even looked concerned. Piece by piece the huddle of children broke back into their daily play until I could get a peek at what it was they were so interested in. On the other side of the fence, crouched beneath the shadows of the woods, was a boy.



He looked each boy in the eye when he asked them to play. It felt like a plea, a desperate attempt to find a friend. The boys didn’t care though, how could they? The boy in the woods spoke in a tongue they didn’t understand. Like me, he spoke with no tongue at all. It was a lonely way to speak in this school. Alone was a hard place to be in eighth grade. After seeing him I felt we could be there together.



When the last boy peeled away I walked to the fence. With each step I felt more emboldened, more hopeful to finally have a friend.



‘I can’t talk to you, I need normal friends.’



The words echoed from moments I had the same urge in the past. But this time had to be different. He was like me, he would understand me.



‘Aren’t you contagious, Holly?’ I shook my head and tried to keep the past away like a swarm of bees, but they kept stinging.



‘What are you doing with your hands, weirdo?’



‘Go away, people will think I’m weird too if you’re next to me.’



‘Did God make you broken on purpose?’



I was stuck half way to the fence. All the sounds of the school yard vanished behind the words. This was a stupid idea. No one wanted to be my friend. Why did I even walk this far? What a waste. I turned around to go back and pretend I was like the other girls. I wanted to smile when they smiled and laughed when they laughed without the embarrassment of having them see me, but my mom’s voice cut through the swarm.



‘She’s just shy.’



I knew she wasn’t our supervisor that day. The girls wouldn’t have talked quite as loud and the boys wouldn’t have played quite as hard if she was. Chipper, as the other kids called her in whispers, held the reputation of a drill sergeant when she wore the habit. The type of nun to crack a ruler across your knuckles if you misbehaved during her prime years. Though, the main reason she earned the brand ‘Chipper’ was the small chip missing from her front tooth.



‘She’s just shy.’ Her voice replayed in my head.



Her catchphrase when anyone asked about me. Why doesn’t she talk? She’s just shy. What happened to her? She’s just shy. It was a simpler explanation than the truth. A less shameful statement than the truth, I was born like this. But I’m not shy, or at least I refuse to be. I closed my eyes and took a first step towards the boy. The yard got a little quieter as the other kids vacated the area around the boy in the woods. When I felt the beating sun disappear behind the shade of the trees I stopped and waited for a moment.



‘I’m not shy.’ I thought to myself but before I had the courage to open my eyes, the fence rattled.



The clatter of the chain-linked fence stopped with the stomp of feet meeting the ground. Step by step he came closer until I heard his heavy, phlegm-rattled breath just in front of me. With one final reassurance I opened my eyes. Immediately, I knew why the other kids avoided him.



He was big. Much bigger than the other boys in our grade. Most of the boys were just sprouting the first seedlings of hair on their forearm while his forearms were already coated. A leather canteen dangled from his belt. His chest and shoulders stood at my eye level and were noticeably broad even under his tattered gray jacket. Hair even started to sprout on his neck just below his white mask, a detail I hadn’t noticed across the yard. An elephant mask made cheap and pressed to his face with a single elastic string that ran in an eroded divot around his head before it vanished into the cave of his gray jacket’s hood. In the center where the trunk should be was only a hole. The jagged edges of the plastic hole encircled a void too deep to see any detail of his face through. My breath stuttered. This person could hurt me, or take me, or do anything else he wanted and I would be helpless. I could scream at the top of my lungs for help but only a strained whine from my over tightened vocal cords would escape. No one would hear that. Hell, I wasn’t even sure he would hear it. I knew my only option was to run but when I took a glance behind me to plan my escape he raised his hand.



He exposed the dry, callused skin of his palm to me. It stayed suspended in the air for a moment before he slowly brought the tips of his fingers towards me. Gently, they landed on my throat. Each of his five fingerprints carefully scraped up and down. I wanted to say something but I couldn’t get my hands to move. I tried to get something to escape my mouth, but I only felt my throat strain under his touch. Finally he removed his hand and signed a single word. A word that I hadn’t heard anyone say to me. A word that turned off all the alarms blaring in my head. 



“Beautiful.” He signed.

  


October, 2023

 

The pond was no wider than twelve feet and smelled like frankincense and sweet licorice. Grass around the pond grew high, and hid something on the other side of the water. Between tufts of grass, a smokey gray shape laid still on the ground. I thought it was a discarded fur coat until I noticed its two beady eyes fixated on me from its white, cone-shaped head.



“What is that, Holly?” Abigail asked.



I loved the sound of her voice. The way it stumbled from one note to the next without guidance. She only used it when we were alone so I knew her brother already ventured beyond earshot. Still, it was conflicting. While I loved our secret it was too wonderful to not be shared, something she stiffly refused to do.



“I think it is an opossum."" I signed.



“Geez. Do you think it’s sick? Should we help it?” Abigail asked. Her hands anxiously scratched at her jeans. 



“Maybe it is just playing dead?” I signed. As if on cue a crow landed just behind the opossum's head and disappeared behind the grass. When the crows head resurfaced, it did with a string of red, slick entrails. It clapped its beak around the guts until it cut a bite out and let the rest flop back to the ground. Abigail’s lip turned in a shocked disgust.



“Method.” I signed. Abigail gave me a jab from her elbow and a laugh, the most wonderful secret of all.



“Holly! You two are supposed to stay close! Get Abigail and follow the sound!” Abigail’s older brother Lucas called before a metallic rattle screeched through the air. He was about twenty three, two years older than Abigail and I. He wouldn’t get any older if he kept up the racket. Abigail watched the annoyance on my face and waited for me to relay the message.



“Your brother is being an idiot.” I signed to her before I held her hand. We rushed through the woods to Lucas. As we ran I kept thinking about the opossum. Even after the crow ripped at its entrails, I swore it blinked.



When we emerged from the woods, Lucas had the chain link fence clutched in both of his fists and was shaking it rapidly. He only stopped when I hit him with a swift slap to the shoulder.



“Hey, what the hell!” He said.



“You know this is illegal right? Are you trying to get caught?” I signed. He glanced at Abigail briefly who was focused on our lips.



“By who? No one is here. Are the birds going to rat us out? Or maybe the squirrels."" He said and signed.



For the first time in years I looked beyond the chain linked fence. Across the overgrown schoolyard was the husk that was once called St. Jude Catholic School. As a kid I always thought the school was shaped like a stale, square bagel. A barren courtyard of a hole was encircled by the depressing corridors and classrooms. It was divided into four sections, each with their own special landmarks. The south side had the main entrance. The East Section had the cafeteria and library. The West Section had the pool and gymnasium and the north, the section we were facing, had the theater. A tiny access door peaked over the edge of the theater’s roof like a timid child.



After the incident, the school tried to reassure the parents by hefty investments in security. All glass was reinforced and every window was fortified with steel bars, but it was too little too late. The parents and their precious tuition money already migrated with their kids to the rival Catholic school upstate. St. Jude was left to succumb to the vines and weather. The corpse looked more like an abandoned prison than a school



“Or maybe the rats will.” Lucas whispered. The thought made my spine wriggle.



“I hope whatever you’re looking for is worth it.” Lucas said as he stomped a path for us through the waist high grass.



We walked around the school building to get to the entrance. At the entrance was a figure. It sat against the front door cloaked in a gray jacket. I felt every muscle in my body constrict at once. Abigail turned to ask what was wrong and all I could do was gesture towards the figure. She immediately tapped Lucas on the shoulder to point his attention towards the mysterious man. The figure eased itself to its feet when it saw us. It waved. A wild wave with arms flapping like the tube men at car dealerships. Then he dropped his hood. To my relief, there was no mask. Only a face, a boyish face. A face I had never seen before and judging by the look on Abigail’s she hadn’t either. Lucas turned to us with an eye roll and motioned us to the boy.



He couldn’t have been older than sixteen. His brunette hair waved chaotically at the top of his bean-pole body. His skin was still plagued with the red specs of puberty, and atop his lip was his most prized possession. A crown of ten scraggly hairs.



“Lucas!...Ladies.” He said with all the charm a boy drowning in supermarket cologne could muster. Abigail took the hearing aids from her ears and stowed them away in her pocket. ‘They don’t even help that much’ she would say if I asked why, but I knew that wasn’t true. I stopped asking and just assured her with a touch on the back.



“Stevie, where’s your brother?” Lucas shot at the kid.



“He got called into work tonight but don’t worry. I’ll get us through safe, I’m like the Outdoor Boys of buildings.” Stevie said.



“I don’t see the gear. Your brother was supposed to bring the gear.” Lucas asked.



“Eh, who needs it anyway. It can’t be that hard.” Stevie proclaimed. Lucas pinched the exhaustion from his brow.



“You have your license?” Lucas asked.



“I got it a couple months ago, thank you for asking.”



“Then drive home.” Lucas said. He put a shoulder to the door.



“I can’t-” 



Lucas heaved the metal door open with a creek followed by the clatter of aluminum cans on the concrete stoop.



“I’ve been drinking.” Stevie finished.



The smell of stagnant, musty water filled the building. Puddles spotted the tile floor and grew with a rhythmic drip. The entryway ran perpendicular to the south section hallway. At their intersection was a trophy case with only smashed glass to show.



The last couple of weeks before the school closed were a blur. Teachers at first tried to maintain the illusion of safety but as the halls grew more and more empty, they gave up the act. Everyone was scared except for me. I just went through the motions, a passenger in my own body. As I reentered the remains of the school I could only wonder if it really was worth it. Where had I even had it last? Maybe my locker? It was as good a place to check first as any. I just wanted to get out of there as soon as possible. I wasn’t a passenger anymore, I felt the fear.



“What are you thinking?” Abigail signed to me as we walked down the hallway. She always seemed to know the answer, she read plain as day on my face. Still, she wanted to know what I would say.



“It is just like I remember.” I signed to her with a smile. As we passed locker after locker I noticed that each one had a dent. A softball size dent near the latch that left them ajar by the thinnest crack. The further we went the more I noticed a splotch or a smear of brown stained blood in the dents. When we turned the corner to the East Section when I heard a rattle come from behind us. I snapped my head around to see nothing besides the damp floor tiles and busted lockers we’d passed since we turned the corner.



“-right ladies?” Stevie shouted before he spun around to look at us while he walked backwards. To that moment, I almost forgot he and Lucas were blubbering to each other ahead of us. He waited for a response while the alcohol that sloshed around in his pinky-thin body made him forget his land legs. Had they heard the rattle too? 



“Did he say something?” Abigail signed to me. Stevie was zapped into a panic. He blocked his mouth from our sight.



“Dude, you can’t bring deaf people. They’re gonna get hurt. What the hell is wrong with you?” He said to Lucas who jabbed him in the ribs with his elbow.



“Holly’s mute you dipshit, she can hear you.”



Stevie gathered his wind in a breath before giving a silent, bewildered chuckle to himself. He lagged behind Lucas to get out of his sight. He then raised his hand and mimed like he held something pointed directly at me. Then he popped his thumb down like he pressed the mute button on a TV remote. He winked and turned to catch up to Lucas.



‘She’s just shy.’ My mother’s voice echoed again. After the incident, I learned not to argue with it.



Abigail tugged on my shirt sleeve and pointed to the locker beside us. 



“It ends.” She signed.



Like the others before it, it was dented and stained in blood but each locker beyond it was strangely left untouched. Even stranger, this locker was mine. I opened it. 



“Did you find what you’re looking for?"" Lucas asked, but all that was in my locker were chilling words smeared in blood on the back wall that read ‘YOU PROMISED’.



I sprinted as fast as I could back the way we came. I cut around the corner, flew through the lobby and smashed my weight against the push-bar on the door but it didn’t budge. The doors were locked. A metal chain knotted around the door, sealed shut with a padlock.

  


May, 2016



Shelly was behind by the length of a grass blade and the finish line twig was only a couple inches away. It was still anyone’s race. Rain washed the school yard that morning.The smell of potting soil leaked from the bags stacked between the garden shed and the school yard fence.A colony of snails slid on the bags, ready to be drafted into the snail race. Mine was always named Shelly,as it always was. I thought of it like the lead in a broadway play, though they’re each their own actress, they all wanted to be Shelly. Trunkless didn’t give names to his snails. He never gave me his name either. So in my mind he became Trunkless for the hole in his elephant mask. It was fitting enough. Trunkless never gave his snails a name either. Instead, he gave them a crack. When he found a snail he liked for the day he popped a slit into the shell with his thumbnail. It was as casual to him as shaking a hand. The ease with which he split their shells made me nauseous. When we first started racing snails I asked him why he did it, but the answer was simple. Like the hole in his elephant mask and splits in his knuckles he just liked them better broken, like us.



After many snail races we developed a system. We took turns clapping for our snails, usually in two. I would clap twice. He would clap twice. It was a brilliant idea in concept. Chaperones would only hear the continuous claps of one kid, but we never got the timing right in practice. The awkward pause between our claps was hilariously obvious even after a full year of trying. We stopped trying to make it convincing and it became only a silly tradition while we watched the snails run their foot long marathon, I often got more consumed in the rhythm than the race itself



“Look.” He signed.



I came up with the idea of picking a juicy tomato slice off of my lunch sandwich and stowing it in my pocket to use as motivation beyond the finish line twig. As disappointing as it was to devolve my BLT into a BL, it was proving worth it. Not only were both snails participating, but it was a nail biter. Shelly surged into the lead with only an inch to go. I clapped and waved her forward frantically. He did the same for his snail that started to slip behind, but it was too late. Shelly slipped over the twig to take gold by the thinnest of margins. I jumped up and applauded for the whole yard to hear at the peak athleticism on display. I bent down to get a look at the little olympian as she climbed onto her delicious, red prize.



SQUELCH.



In an instant, Shelly and the tomato were beneath the stubby heel of a black leather shoe. My mother’s shoe. I looked up her habit to see her face, I was shocked to see she didn’t seem angry in the slightest. Her cheeks were flushed with fear. She snatched me by the arm in a vice grip. Her finger tips dug into my skin deep enough to bruise but still I tried to fight it. I knew we would be forbidden from going behind the garden shed. With no other place to hide in the open school yard, I didn’t think I’d ever see him again. That meant no more snail races, no more picking honeysuckles from the bush that grew through the fence, no more friends. I would be back to being an outcast. The quiet kid that no one understood. The broken girl. So I kept fighting which only made my mom’s grip tighter. She blew the whistle around her neck.



“Everyone get inside now! Get inside!” She screamed. I fought until I was pulled back into the school building and the door slammed shut behind us. The only person that brought me any joy was sealed behind it.



The school felt like it was on lockdown for the rest of the day. Nuns monitored the halls between classes and no one was allowed to use the restroom without an adult escort. When the day came to an end I laid on the bleachers by the pool. It was an indoor pool attached to the gymnasium by a single set of double doors. The stinging stench of chlorine cleansed my soul after a particularly taxing day. After school events were canceled that afternoon so there was no splashing from the swim team or shrill tennis shoe chirps from the gym. It was just me and the soothing hum of the pool jets. I spent most of the time looking up through the sunroof. Clouds, birds, and airplanes eased in and out of the glass frame. If I wasn’t looking at the sky I admired the abomination on the wall. A mural, painted with the artistic vision of a blind ape, stained the pearlescent white paint. I assumed it was supposed to be a collage of professional swimmers, but I only thought that because the center-most figure had a vague resemblance to a picture of Michael Phelps I saw once.



“What are you still doing here?” a creaky voice called from the doorway to the gymnasium. A janitor with a spindly gray beard and age-spotted scalp hunched over his trach bin on wheels like a walker. He wasn’t any of the regular janitors I saw throughout the school day. He must have been part of the evening crew.



“What time is it?” I signed, but he kept glaring at me. Of course he didn’t understand. I could practically hear the accusations banging around in his head. I threw my hands up and walked past him. I heard the squeak of his trash bin trailing behind me through my walk of shame to the main entrance.



“I know your face, little girl!” He spat as I swung the door open.



The front of the school was empty. Aside from the occasional bird song it was silent. It was a sticky heat with the smell of rain starting to roll in. stepped out and walked around the building to the parking lot. The lot was empty aside from one car. My mothers. Was she waiting on me? The thought of making her wait this long made me dread getting in the car to receive my scolding. As I stepped into the parking lot I caught a glimpse of a figure standing in the schoolyard. It was Trunkless with his canteen at his hip. He waved me to come towards him.



“I have to show you something.” He signed. I was ecstatic. All day I thought I may never get to see my friend again. Without hesitation I hopped the fence and went to him.



“Where is it?” I signed.



“Just behind the garden shed, but you have to promise me something.”



“Anything.” I signed with a smile.



“You can not tell anyone about this.” I hesitated, but promised with a smile. He nodded and popped the cap off of his canteen. Then he led me behind the shed.

  


October, 2023



“What the fuck, dude? You all got to stop fucking with me man this isn’t funny!” Stevie whined. I was in disbelief. We were just there, we opened the door only a few minutes ago and in that small amount of time, we were chained in. I held the padlock against my palm. It was warm. Someone locked us in. He locked us in. The thought made my head spin as it wrapped around the danger we were in. Abigail’s touched my shoulder.



“Is there another way out of here?” She signed. I swallowed the sick feeling when I saw her and kept it down long enough to think. Each of the three other sections had at least one exit. The cafeteria and library in the East Section each had one. The theater in the North Section had one, and the pool and gymnasium in the West Section had one each. I stood and turned to the group. Lucas racked his brain for some kind of plan. Stevie paced and swore to God that he'd quit drinking if he got out of there in one piece. I signed to Abigail and Lucas about the other exits. Stevie was desperate to know but Lucas only told him to follow. We crept back down the hall. Lucas led the pack with Abigail and I behind him. Each of us kept a careful eye on each door we passed. Stevie stayed behind us as he was told and kept his mind occupied by tight-rope walking a strip of blue tile on the floor. It wasn’t a helpful task but anything to keep his mouth shut was useful to me.



Lucas peeked through the slim glass window on the first classroom door beyond my locker and winced away from it.



He looked back at Abigail and I and shook his head. I couldn’t resist though. I cupped my hands over my eyes and looked in. The rat’s paw scratched at the tile floor. Not a desperate scratch, but an unfolding and refolding of its paws to a steady rhythm. The tile just seemed to get in the way of its claws. Blood stained the corners of the rat's mouth. Its ear flicked away the hoard of flies convinced of its death, and they should have been right. The rat was severed in half. The open wound spilled the animal’s entrails into a hole behind it. All that jutted from the hole was a bear trap’s exposed metal teeth in a crimson-stained grin. Despite the grizzly sight and the unmistakable scent of death oozing from beneath the door, I couldn’t look away from rat's paw. Its distress signal. I wanted to put it out of its misery immediately. The suffering was the worst part. I mustered the courage to bury my nose and do it but just before I turned the doorknob.



SNAP.



A piercing scream came from behind me. Stevie’s foot was gone. It broke through a brittle, blue tile on the floor and sunk its teeth into the boy’s shin so deep it could taste the marrow. The iron scent of blood erupted from the hole. Stevie gripped his calf with white knuckles and screamed hard enough to slice his vocal chords to ribbons, but even over the screams I could hear something. The sound echoed from the school's entrance and ricocheted to me from around the corner. Thick, deliberate footsteps.



I dropped to my knees at the hole and tried to pry the trap open. Once I saw a gap in the trap's jaws, my hands slipped in Stevie’s blood and it snapped shut on the wound sending another scream through his throat. Still, the footsteps got closer, until a figure turned the corner. The white elephant mask with a missing trunk was still strapped to his face. He stood as tall as the door frames. His chest was as broad as a truck grill. With the force of a buffalo he charged directly at us. The same leather canteen swung violently at his hip. I yanked the trap again and again. I didn’t care if I had to work the trap's jaws until it chewed Stevie’s foot off. He had to get free, we had to get out of there. 



Abigail tugged at my shirt and screamed with terrified tears streaking down her cheeks. The monster of a man was only a few feet from us when Lucas grabbed my shirt and slung me away from Stevie's leg. By the time I got to my feet, Trunkless was standing right behind the boy. The black eye slits in the mask aimed right at me. He raised his hand in the air and waved a subtle hello. I was frozen. Everyone, even Stevie, was still for an instant. Trunkless was the first to move. He gently wrapped his hand around the side of Stevie’s head and gouged space for his middle finger into his eye socket. Stevie squealed for him to stop but all the begging did was give him an opening to stuff the mouth of the canteen in. He dumped the liquid down Stevie's throat then jerked it back out. As Stevie coughed and sputtered the man wrapped his fingers around Stevie's bottom teeth and strained as he pulled on the mandible.



“We have to go” Lucas yanked me out of my paralysis and we sprinted down the hallway through the muffled pleading of Stevie and dipped into the first doorway that didn’t seem like a classroom, but before we could close the door the shrill screams were abruptly quieted by a pop.



I laid sprawled on the floor and ran my hands over the itchy carpet. The scratchy texture was enough to remind me that I could feel, that I was breathing. The ceiling above me was tiled. Some had protruding bellies of water.  Most were splotched brown like coffee stains. I counted the stains on beat to the thunderous metronome behind my ribs. One two three, four, five, six. Seven. Eight. Nine… ten…



Lucas already gathered himself enough to survey the room. His footsteps and the rattle of chained exit doors were the only sounds. I pinched my eyes shut and took a deep breath before I sat up to look around. Computers were spaced out on two long tables in the far corner of the room. Just expensive dust collectors without power. A cluster of organized tables and chairs stood close by. The rest of the room was books. Isles and isles of sturdy wooden bookshelf each stuffed with the bane of the school's former attendees. All of which had acquired the pleasing smell of aged paper. There was an indention in the carpet at the end of the nearest aisle. The distinct print of a bookshelf where there wasn't one to be found. Lucas chuckled like he'd figured out the punchline to an unfunny prank.



“He waved at you.” He said. I didn't have to look at him. I could feel his burning eyes on me.



“Fist your locker and now he waves at you.”



“I didn't know.” I signed. I tried to suck the tears back but they already started to pool.



“Who is he? I'm sure you know that, don't you?” He snarled. I could only glance at him. His anger burned, but his quivering lip showed that the fire was fueled by fear. I couldn't say anything. Of course I had no idea he would be here but if I told them who he was, would they leave me? The only other friend I ever had was stalking the halls covered in a kid's blood. I would be alone again. Such an awful place.



“You convinced us to come here. You wanted to get something and you sure as shit got it didn't you? What did we do to deserve this, Holly?” I shook my head violently to dodge his accusation. The pools in my eyes overflowed before Abigail saw what was happening and jumped between us.



“Lucas. We are stuck here. All three of us and if we want to get out, we can't be an asshole. We need some trust. Okay?” Abigail signed to him. Lucas swallowed some of his hatred and thought. His sister was always his soft spot.



“Okay, but she needs to give me a reason to.” He looked past Abigail and back at me.



“Why are we here?” He asked. The truth sounded so absurd now. I'm supposed to tell them I got us locked in with a murderer and got a boy killed over a dumb class project from over a decade ago? I couldn't make my hands say anything.



‘She's just shy.’ My mother's words echoed in my head. The only words I remember her saying. Lucas scoffed and walked away from us. Abigail sat next to me and rested her shoulder and head against mine.



“I’m sorry about him. You don’t really know that monster do you?” She signed. I wanted to tell her everything. I always wanted to tell her everything, but I couldn’t shake the knot of dread that formed in my stomach at the thought of doing so. Alone, such an awful place.



“I didn’t know. I didn’t know.” was all I could sign.



“I'm here.” She repeated to me in a calming whisper.



“Holly. Get Abigail and come here.” Lucas demanded. I composed myself the best I could and brought Abigail over. Lucas was standing at an open door. What was on the other side of the door was too dark to be an exit. Far too dark. Just enough moonlight came through the windows of the library to see stairs leading down. The concrete stairs ended abruptly at a waterline so calm it could've been mistaken as frozen.



We were concerned at first but realized whatever microscopic horrors swam around in the flooded basement were nothing compared to the one lurking in the halls. Abigail went down first. She kept her hearing aids in a tight fist above her head and used her other hand to grab Lucas’. He then offered his free hand to me. I hesitated.



“Trust.” He said. The word made me nauseous, but I took his hand and covered our tracks by closing the door behind us.

  


The water swallowed us from feet to naval. Darkness was all around us. All of my existence was a frigid chill soaked up through my spine, the sloshing of legs, and Lucas’ grip around my wrist. All I could do was follow his pull. I fluttered my free hand through the air to find some clue as to where we were until it collided with a massive tank. It rang a hollow twang after my knuckle blindly hit  it. Lucas gave my arm a stern jerk and at the same time, something coiled around my foot and tripped. I thrashed my arms beneath the water to keep my head from submerging beneath the disease festered water. Once I regained my balance I kicked the thing that tripped me into my hand. With the all-consuming darkness taking my vision, I ran my fingers over it to learn what it was. The unmoving serpentine shape ended in an open mouth with rivets for lips. A hose, I realized. I also realized that I wasn’t being pulled anymore. There were no fingers wrapped around my wrist. Lucas let go.



Hinges squealed from further inside the room and ended with a door closed. My first instinct was to splash. To shoot my audio flare for rescue but just as I raised my arms I heard something else. Two claps. I knew it wasn’t them, the sound was too thick, too expecting. Trunkless waited for me to fill in my part. I stayed silent. My feet were anchored to the floor and I hoped that Abigail and Lucas did the same, wherever they were. Something stepped into the water and I pinched every muscle in my face to keep a yelp from escaping. The water stilled after a moment.



Clap… clap…



My nerves prodded every muscle in my body to flee. My resolve was failing but before it completely caved, I escaped in thought. I thought of Abigail and I finding a way out of this school. I thought of leaving this place in a cloud of dust behind our tires and going to a concert. Abigail loved concerts. The crowd pounded the beat into the ground, the speakers blasted the music until it rattled in her chest. The sound was all-encompassing, to the point that even without ears, she could hear it. I imagined dancing with her in the crowd. It was one of the places we felt included. Like the world was made to fit us in. Like I wasn’t alone.



CLAP, CLAP.



The sound snapped me out of thought with a boom to my eardrum. I shrieked and tried to run but his hands quickly crushed my upper arm. He dragged me behind him through the water. I struggled to get my mouth above the water for air. Drowning became my biggest worry until I heard the thud of his boot hit a stair through the splashes. He hoisted me out of the water like I weighed nothing. The hinges squealed again and just before he threw me into the unknown I caught a glimpse of Lucas as he pulled Abigail back into the moonlit library.

1oq7x62,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1oq7x62/shocked_at_how_poorly_designed_the_1zpresso/,Shocked at how poorly designed the 1ZPresso J-Ultra is,"Let me start off by saying that as far as grind quality, this is truly an end-game grinder. I upgraded from a K4 and the increased precision of the clicks allows much more range to play around with. Shots have much less channeling and can go a lot finer before choking. Taste is noticeably improved.

That said, wow, there are some poor design decisions with this grinder. 

**1) Magnetic Catch Cup is Terrible**

The magnets on the catch cup are far too weak. They are also slightly recessed, so coffee grinds get into the gaps and over the magnets, making them even weaker. This means you can't hold the grinder from the base, and your hand can't be touching it AT ALL when you grind, or it wobbles and threatens to fall off. I instead have to grip the grinder around the skinny column on the top half, giving me less leverage, and unless you have small hands, less grip strength. This is too much of a tradeoff to save a few seconds unscrewing it.

**2) The bottom edges of the catch cup are smooth and rounded.**

Why, just why? This thing is already top-heavy, even moreso with the handle attached, and with rounded bottom edges it tips over if you set it on anything other than a perfectly flat level surface. Even if you set it on a towel, or if you bump it the tiniest bit, it tips. My K4 is flat-bottomed with straight edges and nice heavy catch cup, so it almost never got knocked over.

**3) It grinds very slowly.**

This things feels like it's feeding beans in one at a time, and often has a couple of ""false endings"" to the grind as the last few beans trickle in. I get that this is a tradeoff to make grinding less strenuous, but it's a good 30 seconds longer to grind a dose than my K4 took. 

Rant over. Still very happy with the grinder, but for $200 you'd think it would be at least as well designed as a $90 grinder. Is anyone else struggling with this design, or am I being too critical and picky?",1,1762456273.0,espresso,3,0.56,False

**What is Cranksgiving?**

Cranksgiving is an annual charitable bike ride that combines elements of a group bike ride, scavenger hunt and food drive. Originating in New York City in 1999, Cranksgiving invites cyclists of all ages and skill levels to participate in a fun event aimed at helping local communities. Participants ride through their cities, stopping at designated grocery stores to purchase specific food items. These items are then donated to local food banks, shelters, or other charities to support those in need during the holiday season.

The event usually occurs in November, around Thanksgiving, and has spread to cities worldwide. It’s often organized by local cycling communities or non-profit organizations. Cranksgiving emphasizes community building, giving back, and showcasing the power of bikes for good, with a light-hearted spirit that makes it accessible and enjoyable for everyone.

I need your help in letting me know how good my resume is in its current state and what tweaks can I do to make it even better.

I also would be very grateful as to what other things can I do than just apply online to make my chances better of getting into IB? I went through some posts on this sub and a lot of them advise attending networking events or just cold emails. Would that be the proper approach?

I can also ""feel"" the Vyvanse when it kicks in. On the flip side, it quiets my brain and calms me down. I am able to focus in on things I need to do, but only for a certain period of time after taking it. 

Switched to Concerta at the lowest dose (18mg?) and experienced flu like symptoms. Most notable was the eye pressure/headache. It just constantly felt like a headache in my eyeballs, I for a second there thought I had COVID. I switched back to the Vyvanse and it is now causing the same eyeball issue, but I didn't experience this with it before.

My doctor is unavailable for 2 weeks and I have an appointment scheduled for 2 weeks after she comes back. I'm not sure if this is a situation where I should just stop taking it, or if I should continue to take it and try different things. I was only diagnosed around 2-3 months ago and I am in my 30's. I don't have anyone in my life diagnosed and medicated that I can discuss it with to understand what is normal and what isn't, so I am constantly feeling a bit lost and would appreciate some tips or similar experiences. 

Some notable things that may be contributing are:

I am not eating as well or as frequently as I should be, but I am drinking enough water.

I am taking it on an empty stomach (before my morning coffee) because I cannot physically eat in the morning, it turns my stomach. 

I am highly sensitive to some medications while being seemingly unaffected by others (like local anesthesia). It tends to be either extreme. Additionally, if there is a super rare side effect for a medication, I am the person who always experiences it. 

I metabolize medications quickly. 20mg Vyvanse taken at 7:30AM will hit me at 8AM and I will start crashing around 10-10:30AM. ",2,1762456125.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

I live in the UK and am very new to coffee. I recently invested in a Dedica EC865 but even after following expert advice from this subreddit, I have failed to make a consistently decent espresso, so I'm sending it back. 

I would like to buy something else in its place, and I'm swithering between a semi-automatic option (Sage Barista / Express / Impress / Pro) or separate grinder and espresso machine. We enjoy espresso, Americano, and flat whites. I hope to buy something that comes in around £750 full price but hopefully much less with the upcoming Black Friday sales.

I would like to say I am keen to get deep into the process of espresso-making, but with small kids running about and the house generally in chaos, the opportunities to geek-out will be at a premium. The reality is I probably need something that allows me to produce high quality, consistent results fairly easily on a busy morning. If it can also let me do more of the manual process when I've time, that would also be great. But perhaps that's asking for too much?

Given my situation you can see why the Sage machines have some appeal, but I also like the option of separate grinder and machine, largely because they seem capable of producing better coffee. Moreover, I have read conflicting reports about the quality of the inbuilt Sage grinders. I'd be willing to go with a standalone setup if the general view is that the process is 'quick enough' once you get into the habit of it.

Hoping you can retrieve me from my overthinking and offer some advice and recommendations for both options: semi-automatic with inbuilt grinder and standalone.

by midweek, I’ve usually hit my rhythm. working on client automations, tuning a report, or taking on a new art project. I take a walk with my dog, maybe have a chat with my mom... maybe not. dinner is whatever I feel like. sometimes eggs and toast, sometimes sushi because I can.

For those who care enough to listen or enjoy misery

I wish I could go back. Back to before that day. Back to when I had a family. A home. Something to live for. But it’s too late for that now. There is no going back. The events that have transpired have made that perfectly clear. So here I sit contemplating continued existence. In my mind I am dead my body just doesn’t know it yet. Some might say I’m being dramatic but once you’ve been what I’ve been through, seen what I have seen, lost what I have lost then you might just agree with me.

I once had a family, a loving husband, Swisstopher, and a darling baby boy, Parmeshawn. We lived in a small cottage slightly outside of the town Provolonst. Provolonst was a small and endearing town. One in which your neighbor was your grade school teacher and you’ve known the mail man for as long as you can remember. I worked as bank teller at the National Queso and Swisstopher owned his own small painting company. Life was happy and loving. I could have never imagined the decay that was brought to the town

It began when our little town was wrote about in the newspaper for the big city about a hundred miles north. The reporter praised our little sanctuary calling it peaceful and an excellent respite from the hustle and bustle of the city life. Of course this brought in the tourism. If I’m being perfectly honest the town could have used some new money but the locals, including myself, where not keen on the inrush of new faces. Some of these tourist went as far as moving into town. Provolonst, although slightly larger now and somewhat more prosperous lost the charm it once had and the new residents brought with them something far more sinister.

Being in a small town the local government reflected the size of the town. Our town hall was being enough to seat 30 but was more often used as a venue for barbeques and volleyball games than it was for its intended political purposes. We had had the same mayor for close to 11 years. He was a portly old man who preferred everyone refer to him by his first name, Chetdar. Chetdar was beginning to feel the longing of retirement and soon announced his resignation from his political office. A grand party was thrown in his honor on his last day and the assistant mayor, Montyray, filled in as interim mayor. A short campaign later there were two major runners, Montyray and Muenster who was one of the new comers from the big city. In a surprise win, which looking back was no doubt a rigged election, Muenster won and took his seat as the mayor of our city.

Another benefit of the small town lifestyle is that a lot of the issues that would face a larger town our near nonexistent here. Crime was unheard of as everyone knows everyone else and an act against another would result in a metaphorical exile. The police department consisted of two people who both doubled as the fire department and were last called out when dear old Feta Ann thought someone was breaking into her house. The break in turned out to be the wind knocking a door open. The towns finances had been stable, if not small, for the last 75 years and there simply weren’t enough people for many of the social issues known to bigger cities. Sufficed to say there wasn’t a whole lot for the mayor to do and often the person holding the position would have another job. However this wasn’t the case with Muenster. The mayor had a small office in the town hall and he would stay in there with the door closed for upwards of 10 hours a day without making any sound. On the rare occasions that he was out and not cast away to his office he greeted people with a smile and wave. People talk and news spread of our polite but strange mayor.

The first act as mayor Muenster made was to build a church. Church was normally held in the town hall and between the coffee set out for the parishioners and podium for the priest one was hard pressed to find some free room. Naturally the residents were very happy with this decision and Muenster, being quite well off before coming to live here, even offered to donate the majority of what it would cost to build the church. Our town was quite self-sufficient and all the companies required to build the church could be found in Provolonst. Instead of finding companies from other cities which might have been cheaper Muenster hired all local companies. This went over well with the towns inhabitants and for a short time it seemed that life would be alright with Muenster as our mayor. Even Swisstophers company was hired to paint the church. I remember that day well because once he was done painting the church was opened and evil began.

In a surprise to the town Muenster announced he would be holding the services. I myself am not religious so I didn’t plan on attending however Swisstopher went taking Parmeshawn. The service last alittle over an hour and Swisstopher came home with Parmeshawn to find me writing a letter to my mother.

“How was it? Was Muenster a good pastor?”

“It was good. You should go. I think you’d like it” He replied. Then walked off.

This was strange coming from him because he knows I’m not religious and we had had a big fight about it when we were first dating. Since then he has let me have my lack of religion as I’ve let him have his religion. From Monday to Saturday life remained normal. We worked, ate, slept, talked, played with Parmeshawn and did everything a normal family would do. However on Sundays Swisstopher would get up, go to church, come home and would tell me…

“It was good. You should go. I think you’d like it”

Swisstopher himself had his oddities so I wrote it off as a quirk but it left me wondering.

Over the coming weeks the general mood of the town changed. People had an unfriendly aura about them. Their lips curved into the smiles that I had come to know and love but their eyes remained dull and listless. They rushed around with a sense of urgency but had no destination. The Provolonst which I loved and cherished was gone. In its place was a demon that greeted you with a hug then stole your soul.

Muenster was by far the most disturbing though. He would run through the streets giving salutations to everyone and asking if they were attending church this weekend. He had also begun to have midweek congregations but these took place at the lake a mile outside of town. It was on one of his maddening treks through town that I had my first interaction with him.

“Goudiola!” He exclaimed.

I was taking a stroll through the town with Parmeshawn and he grabbed me by the ear.

“I’m so glad I could finally meet you! You see I’ve met this little one…” He said as he reached out and touched my sons hair. “But I’ve yet you meet you! I talked to your husband many many times. Fantastic fantastic job he did with the painting of the church. Just excellent. Who would have thought that such a humble man could do such a masterpiece. Excellent.”

He said all of this in the span of one breath. His eyes crazy with what I could only recognize as excitement. The kind of excitement that a man gets when he is near accomplishing a task he has worked so very hard for.

“Yes he is quite the painter. The color just….”

“Yes the color!” He interjected “Yes the color is superb. Now Goudiola why haven’t I seen you in church. You husband and little Parmy here quite devout followers. We would love to have you as part of the fold and next week’s midweek sermon will be a special one!”

His smile was genuine but his eyes gave him away. There was something wrong with him but I couldn’t figure it out. He knew that I knew that he was corrupt but that’s as much as he was willing to reveal of himself.

“Im not quite the church going type”

“Are you sure my dear? You should go. I think you’d like it”

And with that he nodded his head and took off with the same manic energy he possessed earlier. I noticed as he walked away that I had had chills down my neck for the duration of the conversation. I had to see inside the church. There was something going on.

I knew when I was going to see the church. I had it planned out. I didn’t know anyone who hadn’t bought into Muensters ministries so I knew that when they had their midweek sermon at the lake that’s when I could check out the church.

Come Wednesday I kissed goodbye to my husband and son then watched as he walked the mile to the lake. After a half hour I took off to the church. By the time I arrived the sun was setting and cast an ominous glow all about. I tried the front door and to my surprise it was unlocked. I eased into the church, moving swiftly to avoid making any noise. The blinds were closed and with the sun nearly set I could barely peer into the church. I reached out to the wall to try and find a light switch and felt wax. I thought I must have just reached out to a candle but I found a lightswitch and illuminated the room. To my horror and confirmation I had felt wax. But to touch a wall it was impossible not to touch wax. The entire room was coated in a red wax. On the wall above the podium was a large sign that read “The Babybel Congregation” and underneath it burned into wood the words “We welcome the coming” stood clear. I gasped and turned to run out of the church. I had to talk to my husband. This was madness. What was going on here. My son is a part of this! As I spun on my heels towards the door Muenster blocked my way. His smile which could previously be called pleasant was now nothing more than malicious. It finally matched the monster I saw in his eyes.

“Im glad you could make it Goudiola. I think you’ll enjoy our sermon”

I hadn’t noticed the club he had in his hand until it was speeding towards my face. If I had better reactions or was stronger and more athletic I could have dodged the club. Much to my dismay I wasn’t and my world turned black.

My sense of hearing brought me to before my vision. In a loud chant I kept hearing the foods “FON DU, FON DU, FON DU….” I opened my eyes and I was sitting on the ground against a tree. The town was gathered around the lake chanting in unison. Muenster stood at the middle of them. He watched them chant smiling that manic smile and shouted out to them…

“This is the night of the coming! This is the night we have been waiting for! This is our purpose! Chetdar, Feta Ann, you are worthy! Montyray, Swisstopher you are worthy!” He lowered his tone and he turned to me. “Goudiola, Parmeshawn, you. Are worthy”

It was then that I noticed the heat. It had been a cool fall evening when I left to venture to the church but now it was hot. The humidity clung to the air. It felt like the middle of summer during a heatwave. The ground was hot. The tree I was resting upon was hot. And the lake was boiling.

The night sky separated into a burst of light which was then blocked by a two pronged fork.

“It is time! Enter the lake and accept the higher power.” Screamed Muenster.

The residents of Provolonst ran into the lake. Screams filled the air and the nightmarish scene in front of me was only amplified by the smiles on the residents faces as I watched them melt to their death.

“Swisstopher it is time!” proclaimed Muenster as he turned his gaze to my husband who was hold Parmeshawn. Swisstopher faced away from the lake to lake to look at me against the tree.

“It is time my love. Our purpose is calling”

He began walking into the lake. The pain of the heat painted across his face. Parmeshawn began crying. As Swisstopher ventured further into the lake I could see his flesh begin to melt away. The pain was finally too much and he gave into the signals being sent to his brain tearing across his neurons. His screams mixed with the crying of Parmeshawn echoed across the lake. He scalding water reached his waste and he was no longer able to control his functions. Son in hand he fell forward into the water and was completely submerged. As much as the screams burned inside my ears the silence burned louder.

“Your husband has shown his devout following. You may not accept our way but you shall join us” Muenster said as he walked toward me. The pleasure across his face was near orgasmic as I sat frozen in shock.

“Your little paradise has been the perfect foundation.” He said as he stalked towards me. “You shall join us. You will like it” He repeated. Words that have since left a haunting memory in my mind.

Muenster grabbed my foot and began pulling me towards the lake. I noticed the tears streaming across my face only when the dirt rubbed against my cheek.

“NO. NO. NOOOOOOOOOO!” I screamed. We were near the waters edge now and with death in my view I used my free leg to kick him. He shrugged off my first attempt to free myself which only fed the fear within me. I kicked harder. Again and again.

“Stop resisting! You will be among us” Muenster shouted but I was of a primal mind. I rolled and broke his hold on my ankle. I rolled up to stand before he could recover from my escape and pushed him into the boiling depths.

Muenster melted away into the heat of the lake with a smile upon his face. The monstrous fork delved into the depths of the lake which was now more person than it was water.

I turned and ran. I ran until I was past the lake. I ran until I was past the town. I stopped to vomit from the mix of terror and exertion then I ran some more. I ran until I was in the next town over. I screamed and banged on the first house I found. I bellowed my story to a perplexed homeowner the words coming out as more incomprehensible than I could have imagined.

I never went back to Provolonst. From what the police have told me the town was completely deserted and the lake from which the sacrifices occurred is entirely gone and in its place lies a dry bed.

I live each day now contemplating my own existence. What is life without that which you once loved. I hope you have taken something from my experience. I fear that with each coming day my will to live withers.

  Recently went to fatburger for breakfast, and like everything else price has gone up.

 You can still get 2 eggs, hashbrowns and 2 toast for 7.99. But I went 2 sausage, and 2 bacon plus coffee came out to $17 before tip, which isn't terrible but theres better options our there if youre gonna break the $20 mark.

Toast was stone cold and butter was unmelted and thick. The rest was ok. Sausage is very savory, bacon is maple, hashbrown portion was minimal. Coffee was fkn strong! (So if you like strong coffee maybe try it here?) Staff was super nice though and willing to fix anything.

I’m a 30 year old male from the UK, had a rough last couple of years health wise but this year after months of checks I got diagnosed with AFIB

I Actually had the symptoms unchecked for nearly two years, I’m a sufferer of gastrointestinal issues / IBS and have been since my late teens / early 20’s. Have suffered with acid reflux as well, but in the last two years what I thought was symptoms of those things seemed to get worse with severe heaviness of my chest, what felt like palpitations, seemed more or less triggered eating or drinking most of the time but noticed other things would trigger it as well.. anyways stupidly for ages I just wrote these episodes off as bad bouts of indigestion and things similar I get with my GI issues.

Fast forward to like 4/5 months ago and I just so happened to get the latest Apple Watch with my new phone contract and within a day of using it I had another one of these episodes and my watch flagged up with AFIB warnings and safe to say it sent me to pure panic. 

To shorten the story for the 3 months after that I had immediately contacted my doctors, had multiple blood tests, multiple ecg’s which came back normal until I finally had a 24 hour ecg which was luckily on me whilst I had an episode during sleep which lead to my formal diagnosis of AFIB, from there I had more blood tests and was prescribed the beta blockers and blood thinners Bisoprolol and Apixaban, and I’m due to have an echocardiogram in the next two weeks to check my heart.

Unfortunately I am an overweight man, not so much due to eating badly, I don’t drink tea, coffee, alcohol or drugs, and keep on top of my food diet as best as possible. my only vice is vaping. 

But anyways, two years ago I got diagnosed with compressed discs in my spine causing “sciatica” which was actually misdiagnosed and turned out to be Cauda Equina, leading to emergency discectomy surgery, which then also left me in recovery for the best part of a year, and in that time my mobility was greatly reduced and I still have chronic back pain from the whole ordeal still leaving me with reduced mobility and ability to excercise enough to greatly reduce my weight. On top of this now I’m worrying about the root cause of the AFIB. I’m unsure if it’s related to my family history of blood and heart issues or if it could be a Vegus nerve irritation issue or if it’s due to sleep apnea (still trying to get help with this from my doctor but there yet to still offer me a sleep study)

On top of that I now have all these horrible symptoms I get during an episode, which almost always include sweats, hot flushes, phantom pains, chest tightness and heaviness, palpitations, headaches, breathlessness, fatigue, stomach aches, constipation. Sometimes all of the above and sometimes selections of a few. it weirdly seems to make the back pain I already have ten times worse as well which is odd to me.. but these episodes also debilitate me from wanting to do anything and they just make me feel so awful. Sometimes they can last a day. Sometimes more, so far the longest I have been in AFIB is 5 days before it started to let up and even in the day or so after I felt so exhausted from it 

The doctors help I won’t say was good by any means as my GP is bad, but they were very proactive in the two months they were testing me and diagnosing. But since being put on the meds my doctors have more or less clocked out. I tried asking about finding a root cause to the AFIB and that’s when they said about maybe a sleep study, and referred me to echo-cardiology, but when I tried to tell them how bad the symptoms were they more or less said if I want them to stop it’s lifestyle changes like losing weight which I’m already finding incredibly difficult. My diet isn’t bad. I’ve tried reducing even more of the bad parts of my diet. My issue is mobility more than anything but I still had these symptoms before I put all the weight on when I thought it was still a gastrointestinal problem so I’m not even confident losing weight would stop those symptoms.

I just hate the way these episodes make me feel and will try and do anything to reduce them at the very least so advice will be greatly appreciated, I’ve even felt them get worse in the last week or so, not only lasting a lot longer but also being triggered indiscriminately. Doesn’t matter what I eat or drink or even if I don’t out of fear. Absolutely anything and everything is triggering it at this point. I even had an episode today triggered by laughing🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
 
But yeah… that’s my story and how I got my diagnosis, not sure why I’m even putting it here, maybe just to not feel alone with it, maybe here some tips on how you guys deal with your episodes? Or your stories living with AFIB in general, anything really to help someone who’s very newly diagnosed and overwhelmed with it all as I don’t feel overly supported by my doctor anymore now I’m on meds, as long as I don’t stroke or have a heart attack they don’t seem to care about the rest and the quality of life aspect of having the episodes 

But yeah if you read all the way here thanks for reading, I appreciate it a lot and sorry for the rambling!

I posted a month or so ago that I was re-exposed to mold and my numbers were OFF the charts (1062 when 37 is high on the one that my LLMD said is the most dangerous). They are attached.

(Me: I'm late stage, chronic Lyme with 5 co-infections. I was bedridden for 1.75 years and had Severe neurological problems.)

I've been treating my mold with all of the things I posted in the image as well as Hyperbaric Chamber, IR sauna, my amazing vibration plate and eating tons raw butter like that's a normal thing to do (mold is fat soluble....that's why my body was craving it!). 

Research autophagy. I know, I know, your body can't do it, you'll get dizzy, you have this reason. I had ALL the reasons. 

@sickguy777 posted about fasting for mold (Thank you!!!) and it changed my life. I'm doing Intermittent Fasting everyday and Extended fasting as often as I can. I'm down 15 lbs and have way more energy. I'm flabbergasted. I was bedridden again by mold almost two months ago. My LLMD's eyes Lit Up when I told him I was fasting. 

My tips (I'm nowhere close to a doctor. This is what worked for me. Talk to your doc): 
-Hunger comes in waves. Ride the wave; it will pass. Most stop being hungry after 48 hours. This was Not the case for me (maybe because of my insulin resistance?). But I made it. I kept telling myself that I was doing it for healing, kept praying and reminded myself that if it was easy, everyone would do it. 
-Coffee and tea make you feel like you're eating/full. Allegedly organic stevia is okay. 
-Some supplements stop your autophagy! Avoid!  -Tons of electrolytes. Headache: more electrolytes 

Extended fasting: on day 4 and day 5, I added 1/2 tsp. of coconut oil to my decaf (mold free !) coffee to make my gallbladder release bile. It can build up, get disgusting and cause gallstones. Apparently this amount of coconut oil does not really affect autophagy.

I’ll be in Guwahati on the 9th and Kolkata on the 13th, doing the usual founder shuffle – branch offices, back-to-back meetings, everyone saying “sir, just 2 minutes” for things that take 20.

By 10 PM, I’m done being “sir” and “boss.”
That’s when I switch lanes: coffee if the day was kind, wine or a good drink if the day was… productive in a painful way.

A bit about me (non- LinkedIn edition):
I run a growing business with offices in multiple cities, spend too much time in airports, and have a soft spot for honest conversations, and people who bring a calmer, warmer energy than the all-day boys’ club I sit in meetings with.

If you know late-night spots in Guwahati or Kolkata –
cozy cafés, wine places, bars where you can actually hear each other –
and you enjoy unhurried, real conversations after a long day, I’m happy to swap stories and let your city show off a little.

No drama, no pressure, no weirdness – just a founder off-duty, a drink, and maybe a night both of us will remember fondly when we’re back to real life.",1,1762455266.0,SFWr4rIndia,0,1.0,False

“Copy, Bradley.” Johnson's static voice came prelude by the trill of a walkie-talkie.

August, 2015

Golden sweet corn rained onto my tray with a salty butter shine. Green beans dipped  into their shallow pool of chicken broth, garlic, diced onion, and bacon. The beans made their presence known with a mouthwatering steam. A mound of potatoes plopped onto the tray and was pressed into a caldera with the back end of the cook's spoon. The divot was filled till it overflowed with a heavenly brown gravy. Last came the pork. A pork with the tenderness of a pudding and the taste of Hawaiian basted honey. Each cut of meat was so fresh it caused rumors that the meat was butchered in the kitchen. I believed them too. Lunch was the best part of St. Jude Catholic School. Unfortunately, it was followed by the worst.

Once our bellies were stuffed to the brim we were banished to the school yard for recess. Fresh cut grass poisoned the air. Summer still burned at the beginning of the school year and the sun blasted a bright sting to the back of my eyes. The day wasn’t made for me. My days were when it rained and we could go to the library to enjoy the silence while the talking boys released their energy into the gym. But days like this were ruled by the talking boys. They squealed and screeched as kick balls and whiffle balls torpedoed through the air. The other girls that weren’t interested in joining the boys usually huddled by the school building telling jokes and updating each other on the latest gossip. I would listen with my back to them. Whenever I heard something especially juicy I would sign my response close to my chest so they didn’t see. I wished I could turn and share all of the gossip I overheard, the benefits of not being noticed. I knew Darren found his dad's booze and planned to bring a bottle to school that week. I knew Bianca got into it with her mom the night before because she was failing math. I imagined they would get a kick out of that. Maybe they'd even be my friend if they understood me but they wouldn't, no one would.

The school yard became unusually quiet. A group of boys huddled at the fence that separated us from the woods. What they saw captured their attention and sewed their mouths shut, at least until they scurried away to giggle in small groups. Not all of them were so amused with the subject beyond the fence. Most looked confused but some even looked concerned. Piece by piece the huddle of children broke back into their daily play until I could get a peek at what it was they were so interested in. On the other side of the fence, crouched beneath the shadows of the woods, was a boy.

He looked each boy in the eye when he asked them to play. It felt like a plea, a desperate attempt to find a friend. The boys didn’t care though, how could they? The boy in the woods spoke in a tongue they didn’t understand. Like me, he spoke with no tongue at all. It was a lonely way to speak in this school. Alone was a hard place to be in eighth grade. After seeing him I felt we could be there together.

When the last boy peeled away I walked to the fence. With each step I felt more emboldened, more hopeful to finally have a friend.

‘I can’t talk to you, I need normal friends.’

The words echoed from moments I had the same urge in the past. But this time had to be different. He was like me, he would understand me.

‘Aren’t you contagious, Holly?’ I shook my head and tried to keep the past away like a swarm of bees, but they kept stinging.

‘What are you doing with your hands, weirdo?’

‘Go away, people will think I’m weird too if you’re next to me.’

‘Did God make you broken on purpose?’

I was stuck half way to the fence. All the sounds of the school yard vanished behind the words. This was a stupid idea. No one wanted to be my friend. Why did I even walk this far? What a waste. I turned around to go back and pretend I was like the other girls. I wanted to smile when they smiled and laughed when they laughed without the embarrassment of having them see me, but my mom’s voice cut through the swarm.

‘She’s just shy.’

I knew she wasn’t our supervisor that day. The girls wouldn’t have talked quite as loud and the boys wouldn’t have played quite as hard if she was. Chipper, as the other kids called her in whispers, held the reputation of a drill sergeant when she wore the habit. The type of nun to crack a ruler across your knuckles if you misbehaved during her prime years. Though, the main reason she earned the brand ‘Chipper’ was the small chip missing from her front tooth.

‘She’s just shy.’ Her voice replayed in my head.

Her catchphrase when anyone asked about me. Why doesn’t she talk? She’s just shy. What happened to her? She’s just shy. It was a simpler explanation than the truth. A less shameful statement than the truth, I was born like this. But I’m not shy, or at least I refuse to be. I closed my eyes and took a first step towards the boy. The yard got a little quieter as the other kids vacated the area around the boy in the woods. When I felt the beating sun disappear behind the shade of the trees I stopped and waited for a moment.

‘I’m not shy.’ I thought to myself but before I had the courage to open my eyes, the fence rattled.

The clatter of the chain-linked fence stopped with the stomp of feet meeting the ground. Step by step he came closer until I heard his heavy, phlegm-rattled breath just in front of me. With one final reassurance I opened my eyes. Immediately, I knew why the other kids avoided him.

He was big. Much bigger than the other boys in our grade. Most of the boys were just sprouting the first seedlings of hair on their forearm while his forearms were already coated. A leather canteen dangled from his belt. His chest and shoulders stood at my eye level and were noticeably broad even under his tattered gray jacket. Hair even started to sprout on his neck just below his white mask, a detail I hadn’t noticed across the yard. An elephant mask made cheap and pressed to his face with a single elastic string that ran in an eroded divot around his head before it vanished into the cave of his gray jacket’s hood. In the center where the trunk should be was only a hole. The jagged edges of the plastic hole encircled a void too deep to see any detail of his face through. My breath stuttered. This person could hurt me, or take me, or do anything else he wanted and I would be helpless. I could scream at the top of my lungs for help but only a strained whine from my over tightened vocal chords would escape. No one would hear that. Hell, I wasn’t even sure he would hear it. I knew my only option was to run but when I took a glance behind me to plan my escape he raised his hand.

He exposed the dry, callused skin of his palm to me. It stayed suspended in the air for a moment before he slowly brought the tips of his fingers towards me. Gently, they landed on my throat. Each of his five fingerprints carefully scraped up and down. I wanted to say something but I couldn’t get my hands to move. I tried to get something to escape my mouth, but I only felt my throat strain under his touch. Finally he removed his hand and signed a single word. A word that I hadn’t heard anyone say to me. A word that turned off all the alarms blaring in my head. 

“Beautiful.” He signed.

October, 2023

 

The pond was no wider than twelve feet and smelled like frankincense and sweet licorice. Grass around the pond grew high, and hid something on the other side of the water. Between tufts of grass, a smokey gray shape laid still on the ground. I thought it was a discarded fur coat until I noticed its two beady eyes fixated on me from its white, cone-shaped head.

“What is that, Holly?” Abigail asked.

I loved the sound of her voice. The way it stumbled from one note to the next without guidance. She only used it when we were alone so I knew her brother already ventured beyond earshot. Still, it was conflicting. While I loved our secret it was too wonderful to not be shared, something she stiffly refused to do.

“I think it is an opossum."" I signed.

“Geez. Do you think it’s sick? Should we help it?” Abigail asked. Her hands anxiously scratched at her jeans. 

“Maybe it is just playing dead?” I signed. As if on cue a crow landed just behind the opossum's head and disappeared behind the grass. When the crows head resurfaced, it did with a string of red, slick entrails. It clapped its beak around the guts until it cut a bite out and let the rest flop back to the ground. Abigail’s lip turned in a shocked disgust.

“Method.” I signed. Abigail gave me a jab from her elbow and a laugh, the most wonderful secret of all.

“Holly! You two are supposed to stay close! Get Abigail and follow the sound!” Abigail’s older brother Lucas called before a metallic rattle screeched through the air. He was about twenty three, two years older than Abigail and I. He wouldn’t get any older if he kept up the racket. Abigail watched the annoyance on my face and waited for me to relay the message.

“Your brother is being an idiot.” I signed to her before I held her hand. We rushed through the woods to Lucas. As we ran I kept thinking about the opossum. Even after the crow ripped at its entrails, I swore it blinked.

When we emerged from the woods, Lucas had the chain link fence clutched in both of his fists and was shaking it rapidly. He only stopped when I hit him with a swift slap to the shoulder.

“Hey, what the hell!” He said.

“You know this is illegal right? Are you trying to get caught?” I signed. He glanced at Abigail briefly who was focused on our lips.

“By who? No one is here. Are the birds going to rat us out? Or maybe the squirrels."" He said and signed.

For the first time in years I looked beyond the chain linked fence. Across the overgrown schoolyard was the husk that was once called St. Jude Catholic School. As a kid I always thought the school was shaped like a stale, square bagel. A barren courtyard of a hole was encircled by the depressing corridors and classrooms. It was divided into four sections, each with their own special landmarks. The south side had the main entrance. The East Section had the cafeteria and library. The West Section had the pool and gymnasium and the north, the section we were facing, had the theater. A tiny access door peaked over the edge of the theater’s roof like a timid child.

After the incident, the school tried to reassure the parents by hefty investments in security. All glass was reinforced and every window was fortified with steel bars, but it was too little too late. The parents and their precious tuition money already migrated with their kids to the rival Catholic school upstate. St. Jude was left to succumb to the vines and weather. The corpse looked more like an abandoned prison than a school

“Or maybe the rats will.” Lucas whispered. The thought made my spine wriggle.

“I hope whatever you’re looking for is worth it.” Lucas said as he stomped a path for us through the waist high grass.

It was.

We walked around the school building to get to the entrance. At the entrance was a figure. It sat against the front door cloaked in a gray jacket. I felt every muscle in my body constrict at once. Abigail turned to ask what was wrong and all I could do was gesture towards the figure. She immediately tapped Lucas on the shoulder to point his attention towards the mysterious man. The figure eased itself to its feet when it saw us. It waved. A wild wave with arms flapping like the tube men at car dealerships. Then he dropped his hood. To my relief, there was no mask. Only a face, a boyish face. A face I had never seen before and judging by the look on Abigail’s she hadn’t either. Lucas turned to us with an eye roll and motioned us to the boy.

He couldn’t have been older than sixteen. His brunette hair waved chaotically at the top of his bean-pole body. His skin was still plagued with the red specs of puberty, and atop his lip was his most prized possession. A crown of ten scraggly hairs.

“Lucas!...Ladies.” He said with all the charm a boy drowning in supermarket cologne could muster. Abigail took the hearing aids from her ears and stowed them away in her pocket. ‘They don’t even help that much’ she would say if I asked why, but I knew that wasn’t true. I stopped asking and just assured her with a touch on the back.

“Stevie, where’s your brother?” Lucas shot at the kid.

“He got called into work tonight but don’t worry. I’ll get us through safe, I’m like the Outdoor Boys of buildings.” Stevie said.

“I don’t see the gear. Your brother was supposed to bring the gear.” Lucas asked.

“Eh, who needs it anyway. It can’t be that hard.” Stevie proclaimed. Lucas pinched the exhaustion from his brow.

“You have your license?” Lucas asked.

“I got it a couple months ago, thank you for asking.”

“Then drive home.” Lucas said. He put a shoulder to the door.

“I can’t-” 

Lucas heaved the metal door open with a creek followed by the clatter of aluminum cans on the concrete stoop.

“I’ve been drinking.” Stevie finished.

The smell of stagnant, musty water filled the building. Puddles spotted the tile floor and grew with a rhythmic drip. The entryway ran perpendicular to the south section hallway. At their intersection was a trophy case with only smashed glass to show.

The last couple of weeks before the school closed were a blur. Teachers at first tried to maintain the illusion of safety but as the halls grew more and more empty, they gave up the act. Everyone was scared except for me. I just went through the motions, a passenger in my own body. As I reentered the remains of the school I could only wonder if it really was worth it. Where had I even had it last? Maybe my locker? It was as good a place to check first as any. I just wanted to get out of there as soon as possible. I wasn’t a passenger anymore, I felt the fear.

“What are you thinking?” Abigail signed to me as we walked down the hallway. She always seemed to know the answer, she read plain as day on my face. Still, she wanted to know what I would say.

“It is just like I remember.” I signed to her with a smile. As we passed locker after locker I noticed that each one had a dent. A softball size dent near the latch that left them ajar by the thinnest crack. The further we went the more I noticed a splotch or a smear of brown stained blood in the dents. When we turned the corner to the East Section when I heard a rattle come from behind us. I snapped my head around to see nothing besides the damp floor tiles and busted lockers we’d passed since we turned the corner.

“-right ladies?” Stevie shouted before he spun around to look at us while he walked backwards. To that moment, I almost forgot he and Lucas were blubbering to each other ahead of us. He waited for a response while the alcohol that sloshed around in his pinky-thin body made him forget his land legs. Had they heard the rattle too? 

“Did he say something?” Abigail signed to me. Stevie was zapped into a panic. He blocked his mouth from our sight.

“Dude, you can’t bring deaf people. They’re gonna get hurt. What the hell is wrong with you?” He said to Lucas who jabbed him in the ribs with his elbow.

“Holly’s mute you dipshit, she can hear you.”

Stevie gathered his wind in a breath before giving a silent, bewildered chuckle to himself. He lagged behind Lucas to get out of his sight. He then raised his hand and mimed like he held something pointed directly at me. Then he popped his thumb down like he pressed the mute button on a TV remote. He winked and turned to catch up to Lucas.

‘She’s just shy.’ My mother’s voice echoed again. After the incident, I learned not to argue with it.

Abigail tugged on my shirt sleeve and pointed to the locker beside us. 

“It ends.” She signed.

Like the others before it, it was dented and stained in blood but each locker beyond it was strangely left untouched. Even stranger, this locker was mine. I opened it. 

“Did you find what you’re looking for?"" Lucas asked, but all that was in my locker were chilling words smeared in blood on the back wall that read ‘YOU PROMISSED’.

I sprinted as fast as I could back the way we came. I cut around the corner, flew through the lobby and smashed my weight against the push-bar on the door but it didn’t budge. The doors were locked. A metal chain knotted around the door, sealed shut with a padlock.

May, 2016

Shelly was behind by the length of a grass blade and the finish line twig was only a couple inches away. It was still anyone’s race. Rain washed the school yard that morning.The smell of potting soil leaked from the bags stacked between the garden shed and the school yard fence. A colony of snails slid on the bags, ready to be drafted into the snail race. Mine was always named Shelly, as it always was. I thought of it like the lead in a Broadway play, though they’re each their own actress, they all wanted to be Shelly. Trunkless didn’t give names to his snails. He never gave me his name either. So in my mind he became Trunkless for the hole in his elephant mask. It was fitting enough. Trunkless never gave his snails a name either. Instead, he gave them a crack. When he found a snail he liked for the day he popped a slit into the shell with his thumbnail. It was as casual to him as shaking a hand. The ease with which he split their shells made me nauseous. When we first started racing snails I asked him why he did it, but the answer was simple. Like the hole in his elephant mask and splits in his knuckles he just liked them better broken, like us.

After many snail races we developed a system. We took turns clapping for our snails, usually in two. I would clap twice. He would clap twice. It was a brilliant idea in concept. Chaperones would only hear the continuous claps of one kid, but we never got the timing right in practice. The awkward pause between our claps was hilariously obvious even after a full year of trying. We stopped trying to make it convincing and it became only a silly tradition while we watched the snails run their foot long marathon, I often got more consumed in the rhythm than the race itself

“Look.” He signed.

I came up with the idea of picking a juicy tomato slice off of my lunch sandwich and stowing it in my pocket to use as motivation beyond the finish line twig. As disappointing as it was to devolve my BLT into a BL, it was proving worth it. Not only were both snails participating, but it was a nail biter. Shelly surged into the lead with only an inch to go. I clapped and waved her forward frantically. He did the same for his snail that started to slip behind, but it was too late. Shelly slipped over the twig to take gold by the thinnest of margins. I jumped up and applauded for the whole yard to hear at the peak athleticism on display. I bent down to get a look at the little olympian as she climbed onto her delicious, red prize.

SQUELCH.

In an instant, Shelly and the tomato were beneath the stubby heel of a black leather shoe. My mother’s shoe. I looked up her habit to see her face, I was shocked to see she didn’t seem angry in the slightest. Her cheeks were flushed with fear. She snatched me by the arm in a vice grip. Her finger tips dug into my skin deep enough to bruise but still I tried to fight it. I knew we would be forbidden from going behind the garden shed. With no other place to hide in the open school yard, I didn’t think I’d ever see him again. That meant no more snail races, no more picking honeysuckles from the bush that grew through the fence, no more friends. I would be back to being an outcast. The quiet kid that no one understood. The broken girl. So I kept fighting which only made my mom’s grip tighter. She blew the whistle around her neck.

“Everyone get inside now! Get inside!” She screamed. I fought until I was pulled back into the school building and the door slammed shut behind us. The only person that brought me any joy was sealed behind it.

The school felt like it was on lockdown for the rest of the day. Nuns monitored the halls between classes and no one was allowed to use the restroom without an adult escort. When the day came to an end I laid on the bleachers by the pool. It was an indoor pool attached to the gymnasium by a single set of double doors. The stinging stench of chlorine cleansed my soul after a particularly taxing day. After school events were canceled that afternoon so there was no splashing from the swim team or shrill tennis shoe chirps from the gym. It was just me and the soothing hum of the pool jets. I spent most of the time looking up through the sunroof. Clouds, birds, and airplanes eased in and out of the glass frame. If I wasn’t looking at the sky I admired the abomination on the wall. A mural, painted with the artistic vision of a blind ape, stained the pearlescent white paint. I assumed it was supposed to be a collage of professional swimmers, but I only thought that because the center-most figure had a vague resemblance to a picture of Michael Phelps I saw once.

“What are you still doing here?” a creaky voice called from the doorway to the gymnasium. A janitor with a spindly gray beard and age-spotted scalp hunched over his trach bin on wheels like a walker. He wasn’t any of the regular janitors I saw throughout the school day. He must have been part of the evening crew.

“What time is it?” I signed, but he kept glaring at me. Of course he didn’t understand. I could practically hear the accusations banging around in his head. I threw my hands up and walked past him. I heard the squeak of his trash bin trailing behind me through my walk of shame to the main entrance.

“I know your face, little girl!” He spat as I swung the door open.

The front of the school was empty. Aside from the occasional bird song it was silent. It was a sticky heat with the smell of rain starting to roll in. stepped out and walked around the building to the parking lot. The lot was empty aside from one car. My mothers. Was she waiting on me? The thought of making her wait this long made me dread getting in the car to receive my scolding. As I stepped into the parking lot I caught a glimpse of a figure standing in the schoolyard. It was Trunkless with his canteen at his hip. He waved me to come towards him.

“I have to show you something.” He signed. I was ecstatic. All day I thought I may never get to see my friend again. Without hesitation I hopped the fence and went to him.

“Where is it?” I signed.

“Just behind the garden shed, but you have to promise me something.”

“Anything.” I signed with a smile.

“You can not tell anyone about this.” I hesitated, but promised with a smile. He nodded and popped the cap off of his canteen. Then he led me behind the shed.

October, 2023

“What the fuck, dude? You all got to stop fucking with me man this isn’t funny!” Stevie whined. I was in disbelief. We were just there, we opened the door only a few minutes ago and in that small amount of time, we were chained in. I held the padlock against my palm. It was warm. Someone locked us in. He locked us in. The thought made my head spin as it wrapped around the danger we were in. Abigail’s touched my shoulder.

“Is there another way out of here?” She signed. I swallowed the sick feeling when I saw her and kept it down long enough to think. Each of the three other sections had at least one exit. The cafeteria and library in the East Section each had one. The theater in the North Section had one, and the pool and gymnasium in the West Section had one each. I stood and turned to the group. Lucas racked his brain for some kind of plan. Stevie paced and swore to God that he'd quit drinking if he got out of there in one piece. I signed to Abigail and Lucas about the other exits. Stevie was desperate to know but Lucas only told him to follow. We crept back down the hall. Lucas led the pack with Abigail and I behind him. Each of us kept a careful eye on each door we passed. Stevie stayed behind us as he was told and kept his mind occupied by tight-rope walking a strip of blue tile on the floor. It wasn’t a helpful task but anything to keep his mouth shut was useful to me.

Lucas peeked through the slim glass window on the first classroom door beyond my locker and winced away from it.

He looked back at Abigail and I and shook his head. I couldn’t resist though. I cupped my hands over my eyes and looked in. The rat’s paw scratched at the tile floor. Not a desperate scratch, but an unfolding and refolding of its paws to a steady rhythm. The tile just seemed to get in the way of its claws. Blood stained the corners of the rat's mouth. Its ear flicked away the hoard of flies convinced of its death, and they should have been right. The rat was severed in half. The open wound spilled the animal’s entrails into a hole behind it. All that jutted from the hole was a bear trap’s exposed metal teeth in a crimson-stained grin. Despite the grizzly sight and the unmistakable scent of death oozing from beneath the door, I couldn’t look away from rat's paw. Its distress signal. I wanted to put it out of its misery immediately. The suffering was the worst part. I mustered the courage to bury my nose and do it but just before I turned the doorknob.

SNAP.

A piercing scream came from behind me. Stevie’s foot was gone. It broke through a brittle, blue tile on the floor and sunk its teeth into the boy’s shin so deep it could taste the marrow. The iron scent of blood erupted from the hole. Stevie gripped his calf with white knuckles and screamed hard enough to slice his vocal chords to ribbons, but even over the screams I could hear something. The sound echoed from the school's entrance and ricocheted to me from around the corner. Thick, deliberate footsteps.

I dropped to my knees at the hole and tried to pry the trap open. Once I saw a gap in the trap's jaws, my hands slipped in Stevie’s blood and it snapped shut on the wound sending another scream through his throat. Still, the footsteps got closer, until a figure turned the corner. The white elephant mask with a missing trunk was still strapped to his face. He stood as tall as the door frames. His chest was as broad as a truck grill. With the force of a buffalo he charged directly at us. The same leather canteen swung violently at his hip. I yanked the trap again and again. I didn’t care if I had to work the trap's jaws until it chewed Stevie’s foot off. He had to get free, we had to get out of there. 

Abigail tugged at my shirt and screamed with terrified tears streaking down her cheeks. The monster of a man was only a few feet from us when Lucas grabbed my shirt and slung me away from Stevie's leg. By the time I got to my feet, Trunkless was standing right behind the boy. The black eye slits in the mask aimed right at me. He raised his hand in the air and waved a subtle hello. I was frozen. Everyone, even Stevie, was still for an instant. Trunkless was the first to move. He gently wrapped his hand around the side of Stevie’s head and gouged space for his middle finger into his eyesocket. Stevie squealed for him to stop but all the begging did was give him an opening to stuff the mouth of the canteen in. He dumped the liquid down Stevie's throat then jerked it back out. As Stevie coughed and stuttered the man wrapped his fingers around Stevie's bottom teeth and strained as he pulled on the mandible.

“We have to go” Lucas yanked me out of my paralysis and we sprinted down the hallway through the muffled pleading of Stevie and dipped into the first doorway that didn’t seem like a classroom, but before we could close the door the shrill screams were abruptly quieted by a pop.

I laid sprawled on the floor and ran my hands over the itchy carpet. The scratchy texture was enough to remind me that I could feel, that I was breathing. The ceiling above me was tiled. Some had protruding bellies of water.  Most were splotched brown like coffee stains. I counted the stains on beat to the thunderous metronome behind my ribs. One two three, four, five, six. Seven. Eight. Nine… ten…

Lucas already gathered himself enough to survey the room. His footsteps and the rattle of chained exit doors were the only sounds. I pinched my eyes shut and took a deep breath before I sat up to look around. Computers were spaced out on two long tables in the far corner of the room. Just expensive dust collectors without power. A cluster of organized tables and chairs stood close by. The rest of the room was books. Isles and isles of sturdy wooden bookshelf each stuffed with the bane of the school's former attendees. All of which had acquired the pleasing smell of aged paper. There was an indention in the carpet at the end of the nearest isle. The distinct print of a bookshelf where there wasn't one to be found. Lucas chuckled like he'd figured out the punchline to an unfunny prank.

“He waved at you.” He said. I didn't have to look at him. I could feel his burning eyes on me.

“Fist your locker and now he waves at you.”

“I didn't know.” I signed. I tried to suck the tears back but they already started to pool.

“Who is he? I'm sure you know that, don't you?” He snarled. I could only glance at him. His anger burned, but his quivering lip showed that the fire was fueled by fear. I couldn't say anything. Of course I had no idea he would be here but if I told them who he was, would they leave me? The only other friend I ever had was stalking the halls covered in a kid's blood. I would be alone again. Such an awful place.

“You convinced us to come here. You wanted to get something and you sure as shit got it didn't you? What did we do to deserve this, Holly?” I shook my head violently to dodge his accusation. The pools in my eyes overflowed before Abigail saw what was happening and jumped between us.

“Lucas. We are stuck here. All three of us and if we want to get out, we can't be an asshole. We need some trust. Okay?” Abigail signed to him. Lucas swallowed some of his hatred and thought. His sister was always his soft spot.

“Okay, but she needs to give me a reason to.” He looked past Abigail and back at me.

“Why are we here?” He asked. The truth sounded so absurd now. I'm supposed to tell them I got us locked in with a murderer and got a boy killed over a dumb class project from over a decade ago? I couldn't make my hands say anything.

‘She's just shy.’ My mother's words echoed in my head. The only words I remember her saying. Lucas scoffed and walked away from us. Abigail sat next to me and rested her shoulder and head against mine.

“I’m sorry about him. You don’t really know that monster do you?” She signed. I wanted to tell her everything. I always wanted to tell her everything, but I couldn’t shake the knot of dread that formed in my stomach at the thought of doing so. Alone, such an awful place.

“I didn’t know. I didn’t know.” was all I could sign.

“I'm here.” She repeated to me in a calming whisper.

“Holly. Get Abigail and come here.” Lucas demanded. I composed myself the best I could and brought Abigail over. Lucas was standing at an open door. What was on the other side of the door was too dark to be an exit. Far too dark. Just enough moonlight came through the windows of the library to see stairs leading down. The concrete stairs ended abruptly at a waterline so calm it could've been mistaken as frozen.

We were concerned at first but realized whatever microscopic horrors swam around in the flooded basement were nothing compared to the one lurking in the halls. Abigail went down first. She kept her hearing aids in a tight fist above her head and used her other hand to grab Lucas’. He then offered his free hand to me. I hesitated.

“Trust.” He said. The word made me nauseous, but I took his hand and covered our tracks by closing the door behind us.

The water swallowed us from feet to naval. Darkness was all around us. All of my existence was a frigid chill soaked up through my spine, the sloshing of legs, and Lucas’ grip around my wrist. All I could do was follow his pull. I fluttered my free hand through the air to find some clue as to where we were until it collided with a massive tank. It rang a hollow twang after my knuckle blindly hit  it. Lucas gave my arm a stern jerk and at the same time, something coiled around my foot and tripped. I thrashed my arms beneath the water to keep my head from submerging beneath the disease festered water. Once I regained my balance I kicked the thing that tripped me into my hand. With the all-consuming darkness taking my vision, I ran my fingers over it to learn what it was. The unmoving serpentine shape ended in an open mouth with rivets for lips. A hose, I realized. I also realized that I wasn’t being pulled anymore. There were no fingers wrapped around my wrist. Lucas let go.

Hinges squealed from further inside the room and ended with a door closed. My first instinct was to splash. To shoot my audio flare for rescue but just as I raised my arms I heard something else. Two claps. I knew it wasn’t them, the sound was too thick, too expecting. Trunkless waited for me to fill in my part. I stayed silent. My feet were anchored to the floor and I hoped that Abigail and Lucas did the same, wherever they were. Something stepped into the water and I pinched every muscle in my face to keep a yelp from escaping. The water stilled after a moment.

Clap… clap…

My nerves prodded every muscle in my body to flee. My resolve was failing but before it completely caved, I escaped in thought. I thought of Abigail and I finding a way out of this school. I thought of leaving this place in a cloud of dust behind our tires and going to a concert. Abigail loved concerts. The crowd pounded the beat into the ground, the speakers blasted the music until it rattled in her chest. The sound was all-encompassing, to the point that even without ears, she could hear it. I imagined dancing with her in the crowd. It was one of the places we felt included. Like the world was made to fit us in. Like I wasn’t alone.

CLAP, CLAP.

The sound snapped me out of thought with a boom to my eardrum. I shrieked and tried to run but his hands quickly crushed my upper arm. He dragged me behind him through the water. I struggled to get my mouth above the water for air. Drowning became my biggest worry until I heard the thud of his boot hit a stair through the splashes. He hoisted me out of the water like I weighed nothing. The hinges squealed again and just before he threw me into the unknown I caught a glimpse of Lucas as he pulled Abigail back into the moonlit library.

August, 2015



Golden sweet corn rained onto my tray with a salty butter shine. Green beans dipped  into their shallow pool of chicken broth, garlic, diced onion, and bacon. The beans made their presence known with a mouthwatering steam. A mound of potatoes plopped onto the tray and was pressed into a caldera with the back end of the cook's spoon. The divot was filled till it overflowed with a heavenly brown gravy. Last came the pork. A pork with the tenderness of a pudding and the taste of Hawaiian basted honey. Each cut of meat was so fresh it caused rumors that the meat was butchered in the kitchen. I believed them too. Lunch was the best part of St. Jude Catholic School. Unfortunately, it was followed by the worst.



Once our bellies were stuffed to the brim we were banished to the school yard for recess. Fresh cut grass poisoned the air. Summer still burned at the beginning of the school year and the sun blasted a bright sting to the back of my eyes. The day wasn’t made for me. My days were when it rained and we could go to the library to enjoy the silence while the talking boys released their energy into the gym. But days like this were ruled by the talking boys. They squealed and screeched as kick balls and whiffle balls torpedoed through the air. The other girls that weren’t interested in joining the boys usually huddled by the school building telling jokes and updating each other on the latest gossip. I would listen with my back to them. Whenever I heard something especially juicy I would sign my response close to my chest so they didn’t see. I wished I could turn and share all of the gossip I overheard, the benefits of not being noticed. I knew Darren found his dad's booze and planned to bring a bottle to school that week. I knew Bianca got into it with her mom the night before because she was failing math. I imagined they would get a kick out of that. Maybe they'd even be my friend if they understood me but they wouldn't, no one would.



The school yard became unusually quiet. A group of boys huddled at the fence that separated us from the woods. What they saw captured their attention and sewed their mouths shut, at least until they scurried away to giggle in small groups. Not all of them were so amused with the subject beyond the fence. Most looked confused but some even looked concerned. Piece by piece the huddle of children broke back into their daily play until I could get a peek at what it was they were so interested in. On the other side of the fence, crouched beneath the shadows of the woods, was a boy.



He looked each boy in the eye when he asked them to play. It felt like a plea, a desperate attempt to find a friend. The boys didn’t care though, how could they? The boy in the woods spoke in a tongue they didn’t understand. Like me, he spoke with no tongue at all. It was a lonely way to speak in this school. Alone was a hard place to be in eighth grade. After seeing him I felt we could be there together.



When the last boy peeled away I walked to the fence. With each step I felt more emboldened, more hopeful to finally have a friend.



‘I can’t talk to you, I need normal friends.’



The words echoed from moments I had the same urge in the past. But this time had to be different. He was like me, he would understand me.



‘Aren’t you contagious, Holly?’ I shook my head and tried to keep the past away like a swarm of bees, but they kept stinging.



‘What are you doing with your hands, weirdo?’



‘Go away, people will think I’m weird too if you’re next to me.’



‘Did God make you broken on purpose?’



I was stuck half way to the fence. All the sounds of the school yard vanished behind the words. This was a stupid idea. No one wanted to be my friend. Why did I even walk this far? What a waste. I turned around to go back and pretend I was like the other girls. I wanted to smile when they smiled and laughed when they laughed without the embarrassment of having them see me, but my mom’s voice cut through the swarm.



‘She’s just shy.’



I knew she wasn’t our supervisor that day. The girls wouldn’t have talked quite as loud and the boys wouldn’t have played quite as hard if she was. Chipper, as the other kids called her in whispers, held the reputation of a drill sergeant when she wore the habit. The type of nun to crack a ruler across your knuckles if you misbehaved during her prime years. Though, the main reason she earned the brand ‘Chipper’ was the small chip missing from her front tooth.



‘She’s just shy.’ Her voice replayed in my head.



Her catchphrase when anyone asked about me. Why doesn’t she talk? She’s just shy. What happened to her? She’s just shy. It was a simpler explanation than the truth. A less shameful statement than the truth, I was born like this. But I’m not shy, or at least I refuse to be. I closed my eyes and took a first step towards the boy. The yard got a little quieter as the other kids vacated the area around the boy in the woods. When I felt the beating sun disappear behind the shade of the trees I stopped and waited for a moment.



‘I’m not shy.’ I thought to myself but before I had the courage to open my eyes, the fence rattled.



The clatter of the chain-linked fence stopped with the stomp of feet meeting the ground. Step by step he came closer until I heard his heavy, phlegm-rattled breath just in front of me. With one final reassurance I opened my eyes. Immediately, I knew why the other kids avoided him.



He was big. Much bigger than the other boys in our grade. Most of the boys were just sprouting the first seedlings of hair on their forearm while his forearms were already coated. A leather canteen dangled from his belt. His chest and shoulders stood at my eye level and were noticeably broad even under his tattered gray jacket. Hair even started to sprout on his neck just below his white mask, a detail I hadn’t noticed across the yard. An elephant mask made cheap and pressed to his face with a single elastic string that ran in an eroded divot around his head before it vanished into the cave of his gray jacket’s hood. In the center where the trunk should be was only a hole. The jagged edges of the plastic hole encircled a void too deep to see any detail of his face through. My breath stuttered. This person could hurt me, or take me, or do anything else he wanted and I would be helpless. I could scream at the top of my lungs for help but only a strained whine from my over tightened vocal chords would escape. No one would hear that. Hell, I wasn’t even sure he would hear it. I knew my only option was to run but when I took a glance behind me to plan my escape he raised his hand.



He exposed the dry, callused skin of his palm to me. It stayed suspended in the air for a moment before he slowly brought the tips of his fingers towards me. Gently, they landed on my throat. Each of his five fingerprints carefully scraped up and down. I wanted to say something but I couldn’t get my hands to move. I tried to get something to escape my mouth, but I only felt my throat strain under his touch. Finally he removed his hand and signed a single word. A word that I hadn’t heard anyone say to me. A word that turned off all the alarms blaring in my head. 



“Beautiful.” He signed.

  


October, 2023

 

The pond was no wider than twelve feet and smelled like frankincense and sweet licorice. Grass around the pond grew high, and hid something on the other side of the water. Between tufts of grass, a smokey gray shape laid still on the ground. I thought it was a discarded fur coat until I noticed its two beady eyes fixated on me from its white, cone-shaped head.



“What is that, Holly?” Abigail asked.



I loved the sound of her voice. The way it stumbled from one note to the next without guidance. She only used it when we were alone so I knew her brother already ventured beyond earshot. Still, it was conflicting. While I loved our secret it was too wonderful to not be shared, something she stiffly refused to do.



“I think it is an opossum."" I signed.



“Geez. Do you think it’s sick? Should we help it?” Abigail asked. Her hands anxiously scratched at her jeans. 



“Maybe it is just playing dead?” I signed. As if on cue a crow landed just behind the opossum's head and disappeared behind the grass. When the crows head resurfaced, it did with a string of red, slick entrails. It clapped its beak around the guts until it cut a bite out and let the rest flop back to the ground. Abigail’s lip turned in a shocked disgust.



“Method.” I signed. Abigail gave me a jab from her elbow and a laugh, the most wonderful secret of all.



“Holly! You two are supposed to stay close! Get Abigail and follow the sound!” Abigail’s older brother Lucas called before a metallic rattle screeched through the air. He was about twenty three, two years older than Abigail and I. He wouldn’t get any older if he kept up the racket. Abigail watched the annoyance on my face and waited for me to relay the message.



“Your brother is being an idiot.” I signed to her before I held her hand. We rushed through the woods to Lucas. As we ran I kept thinking about the opossum. Even after the crow ripped at its entrails, I swore it blinked.



When we emerged from the woods, Lucas had the chain link fence clutched in both of his fists and was shaking it rapidly. He only stopped when I hit him with a swift slap to the shoulder.



“Hey, what the hell!” He said.



“You know this is illegal right? Are you trying to get caught?” I signed. He glanced at Abigail briefly who was focused on our lips.



“By who? No one is here. Are the birds going to rat us out? Or maybe the squirrels."" He said and signed.



For the first time in years I looked beyond the chain linked fence. Across the overgrown schoolyard was the husk that was once called St. Jude Catholic School. As a kid I always thought the school was shaped like a stale, square bagel. A barren courtyard of a hole was encircled by the depressing corridors and classrooms. It was divided into four sections, each with their own special landmarks. The south side had the main entrance. The East Section had the cafeteria and library. The West Section had the pool and gymnasium and the north, the section we were facing, had the theater. A tiny access door peaked over the edge of the theater’s roof like a timid child.



After the incident, the school tried to reassure the parents by hefty investments in security. All glass was reinforced and every window was fortified with steel bars, but it was too little too late. The parents and their precious tuition money already migrated with their kids to the rival Catholic school upstate. St. Jude was left to succumb to the vines and weather. The corpse looked more like an abandoned prison than a school



“Or maybe the rats will.” Lucas whispered. The thought made my spine wriggle.



“I hope whatever you’re looking for is worth it.” Lucas said as he stomped a path for us through the waist high grass.



It was.



We walked around the school building to get to the entrance. At the entrance was a figure. It sat against the front door cloaked in a gray jacket. I felt every muscle in my body constrict at once. Abigail turned to ask what was wrong and all I could do was gesture towards the figure. She immediately tapped Lucas on the shoulder to point his attention towards the mysterious man. The figure eased itself to its feet when it saw us. It waved. A wild wave with arms flapping like the tube men at car dealerships. Then he dropped his hood. To my relief, there was no mask. Only a face, a boyish face. A face I had never seen before and judging by the look on Abigail’s she hadn’t either. Lucas turned to us with an eye roll and motioned us to the boy.



He couldn’t have been older than sixteen. His brunette hair waved chaotically at the top of his bean-pole body. His skin was still plagued with the red specs of puberty, and atop his lip was his most prized possession. A crown of ten scraggly hairs.



“Lucas!...Ladies.” He said with all the charm a boy drowning in supermarket cologne could muster. Abigail took the hearing aids from her ears and stowed them away in her pocket. ‘They don’t even help that much’ she would say if I asked why, but I knew that wasn’t true. I stopped asking and just assured her with a touch on the back.



“Stevie, where’s your brother?” Lucas shot at the kid.



“He got called into work tonight but don’t worry. I’ll get us through safe, I’m like the Outdoor Boys of buildings.” Stevie said.



“I don’t see the gear. Your brother was supposed to bring the gear.” Lucas asked.



“Eh, who needs it anyway. It can’t be that hard.” Stevie proclaimed. Lucas pinched the exhaustion from his brow.



“You have your license?” Lucas asked.



“I got it a couple months ago, thank you for asking.”



“Then drive home.” Lucas said. He put a shoulder to the door.



“I can’t-” 



Lucas heaved the metal door open with a creek followed by the clatter of aluminum cans on the concrete stoop.



“I’ve been drinking.” Stevie finished.



The smell of stagnant, musty water filled the building. Puddles spotted the tile floor and grew with a rhythmic drip. The entryway ran perpendicular to the south section hallway. At their intersection was a trophy case with only smashed glass to show.



The last couple of weeks before the school closed were a blur. Teachers at first tried to maintain the illusion of safety but as the halls grew more and more empty, they gave up the act. Everyone was scared except for me. I just went through the motions, a passenger in my own body. As I reentered the remains of the school I could only wonder if it really was worth it. Where had I even had it last? Maybe my locker? It was as good a place to check first as any. I just wanted to get out of there as soon as possible. I wasn’t a passenger anymore, I felt the fear.



“What are you thinking?” Abigail signed to me as we walked down the hallway. She always seemed to know the answer, she read plain as day on my face. Still, she wanted to know what I would say.



“It is just like I remember.” I signed to her with a smile. As we passed locker after locker I noticed that each one had a dent. A softball size dent near the latch that left them ajar by the thinnest crack. The further we went the more I noticed a splotch or a smear of brown stained blood in the dents. When we turned the corner to the East Section when I heard a rattle come from behind us. I snapped my head around to see nothing besides the damp floor tiles and busted lockers we’d passed since we turned the corner.



“-right ladies?” Stevie shouted before he spun around to look at us while he walked backwards. To that moment, I almost forgot he and Lucas were blubbering to each other ahead of us. He waited for a response while the alcohol that sloshed around in his pinky-thin body made him forget his land legs. Had they heard the rattle too? 



“Did he say something?” Abigail signed to me. Stevie was zapped into a panic. He blocked his mouth from our sight.



“Dude, you can’t bring deaf people. They’re gonna get hurt. What the hell is wrong with you?” He said to Lucas who jabbed him in the ribs with his elbow.



“Holly’s mute you dipshit, she can hear you.”



Stevie gathered his wind in a breath before giving a silent, bewildered chuckle to himself. He lagged behind Lucas to get out of his sight. He then raised his hand and mimed like he held something pointed directly at me. Then he popped his thumb down like he pressed the mute button on a TV remote. He winked and turned to catch up to Lucas.



‘She’s just shy.’ My mother’s voice echoed again. After the incident, I learned not to argue with it.



Abigail tugged on my shirt sleeve and pointed to the locker beside us. 



“It ends.” She signed.



Like the others before it, it was dented and stained in blood but each locker beyond it was strangely left untouched. Even stranger, this locker was mine. I opened it. 



“Did you find what you’re looking for?"" Lucas asked, but all that was in my locker were chilling words smeared in blood on the back wall that read ‘YOU PROMISSED’.



I sprinted as fast as I could back the way we came. I cut around the corner, flew through the lobby and smashed my weight against the push-bar on the door but it didn’t budge. The doors were locked. A metal chain knotted around the door, sealed shut with a padlock.

  


May, 2016



Shelly was behind by the length of a grass blade and the finish line twig was only a couple inches away. It was still anyone’s race. Rain washed the school yard that morning. The smell of potting soil leaked from the bags stacked between the garden shed and the school yard fence. A colony of snails slid on the bags, ready to be drafted into the snail race. Mine was always named Shelly, as it always was. I thought of it like the lead in a Broadway play, though they’re each their own actress, they all wanted to be Shelly. Trunkless didn’t give names to his snails. He never gave me his name either. So in my mind he became Trunkless for the hole in his elephant mask. It was fitting enough. Trunkless never gave his snails a name either. Instead, he gave them a crack. When he found a snail he liked for the day he popped a slit into the shell with his thumbnail. It was as casual to him as shaking a hand. The ease with which he split their shells made me nauseous. When we first started racing snails I asked him why he did it, but the answer was simple. Like the hole in his elephant mask and splits in his knuckles he just liked them better broken, like us.



After many snail races we developed a system. We took turns clapping for our snails, usually in two. I would clap twice. He would clap twice. It was a brilliant idea in concept. Chaperones would only hear the continuous claps of one kid, but we never got the timing right in practice. The awkward pause between our claps was hilariously obvious even after a full year of trying. We stopped trying to make it convincing and it became only a silly tradition while we watched the snails run their foot long marathon, I often got more consumed in the rhythm than the race itself



“Look.” He signed.



I came up with the idea of picking a juicy tomato slice off of my lunch sandwich and stowing it in my pocket to use as motivation beyond the finish line twig. As disappointing as it was to devolve my BLT into a BL, it was proving worth it. Not only were both snails participating, but it was a nail biter. Shelly surged into the lead with only an inch to go. I clapped and waved her forward frantically. He did the same for his snail that started to slip behind, but it was too late. Shelly slipped over the twig to take gold by the thinnest of margins. I jumped up and applauded for the whole yard to hear at the peak athleticism on display. I bent down to get a look at the little olympian as she climbed onto her delicious, red prize.



SQUELCH.



In an instant, Shelly and the tomato were beneath the stubby heel of a black leather shoe. My mother’s shoe. I looked up her habit to see her face, I was shocked to see she didn’t seem angry in the slightest. Her cheeks were flushed with fear. She snatched me by the arm in a vice grip. Her finger tips dug into my skin deep enough to bruise but still I tried to fight it. I knew we would be forbidden from going behind the garden shed. With no other place to hide in the open school yard, I didn’t think I’d ever see him again. That meant no more snail races, no more picking honeysuckles from the bush that grew through the fence, no more friends. I would be back to being an outcast. The quiet kid that no one understood. The broken girl. So I kept fighting which only made my mom’s grip tighter. She blew the whistle around her neck.



“Everyone get inside now! Get inside!” She screamed. I fought until I was pulled back into the school building and the door slammed shut behind us. The only person that brought me any joy was sealed behind it.



The school felt like it was on lockdown for the rest of the day. Nuns monitored the halls between classes and no one was allowed to use the restroom without an adult escort. When the day came to an end I laid on the bleachers by the pool. It was an indoor pool attached to the gymnasium by a single set of double doors. The stinging stench of chlorine cleansed my soul after a particularly taxing day. After school events were canceled that afternoon so there was no splashing from the swim team or shrill tennis shoe chirps from the gym. It was just me and the soothing hum of the pool jets. I spent most of the time looking up through the sunroof. Clouds, birds, and airplanes eased in and out of the glass frame. If I wasn’t looking at the sky I admired the abomination on the wall. A mural, painted with the artistic vision of a blind ape, stained the pearlescent white paint. I assumed it was supposed to be a collage of professional swimmers, but I only thought that because the center-most figure had a vague resemblance to a picture of Michael Phelps I saw once.



“What are you still doing here?” a creaky voice called from the doorway to the gymnasium. A janitor with a spindly gray beard and age-spotted scalp hunched over his trach bin on wheels like a walker. He wasn’t any of the regular janitors I saw throughout the school day. He must have been part of the evening crew.



“What time is it?” I signed, but he kept glaring at me. Of course he didn’t understand. I could practically hear the accusations banging around in his head. I threw my hands up and walked past him. I heard the squeak of his trash bin trailing behind me through my walk of shame to the main entrance.



“I know your face, little girl!” He spat as I swung the door open.



The front of the school was empty. Aside from the occasional bird song it was silent. It was a sticky heat with the smell of rain starting to roll in. stepped out and walked around the building to the parking lot. The lot was empty aside from one car. My mothers. Was she waiting on me? The thought of making her wait this long made me dread getting in the car to receive my scolding. As I stepped into the parking lot I caught a glimpse of a figure standing in the schoolyard. It was Trunkless with his canteen at his hip. He waved me to come towards him.



“I have to show you something.” He signed. I was ecstatic. All day I thought I may never get to see my friend again. Without hesitation I hopped the fence and went to him.



“Where is it?” I signed.



“Just behind the garden shed, but you have to promise me something.”



“Anything.” I signed with a smile.



“You can not tell anyone about this.” I hesitated, but promised with a smile. He nodded and popped the cap off of his canteen. Then he led me behind the shed.

  


October, 2023



“What the fuck, dude? You all got to stop fucking with me man this isn’t funny!” Stevie whined. I was in disbelief. We were just there, we opened the door only a few minutes ago and in that small amount of time, we were chained in. I held the padlock against my palm. It was warm. Someone locked us in. He locked us in. The thought made my head spin as it wrapped around the danger we were in. Abigail’s touched my shoulder.



“Is there another way out of here?” She signed. I swallowed the sick feeling when I saw her and kept it down long enough to think. Each of the three other sections had at least one exit. The cafeteria and library in the East Section each had one. The theater in the North Section had one, and the pool and gymnasium in the West Section had one each. I stood and turned to the group. Lucas racked his brain for some kind of plan. Stevie paced and swore to God that he'd quit drinking if he got out of there in one piece. I signed to Abigail and Lucas about the other exits. Stevie was desperate to know but Lucas only told him to follow. We crept back down the hall. Lucas led the pack with Abigail and I behind him. Each of us kept a careful eye on each door we passed. Stevie stayed behind us as he was told and kept his mind occupied by tight-rope walking a strip of blue tile on the floor. It wasn’t a helpful task but anything to keep his mouth shut was useful to me.



Lucas peeked through the slim glass window on the first classroom door beyond my locker and winced away from it.



He looked back at Abigail and I and shook his head. I couldn’t resist though. I cupped my hands over my eyes and looked in. The rat’s paw scratched at the tile floor. Not a desperate scratch, but an unfolding and refolding of its paws to a steady rhythm. The tile just seemed to get in the way of its claws. Blood stained the corners of the rat's mouth. Its ear flicked away the hoard of flies convinced of its death, and they should have been right. The rat was severed in half. The open wound spilled the animal’s entrails into a hole behind it. All that jutted from the hole was a bear trap’s exposed metal teeth in a crimson-stained grin. Despite the grizzly sight and the unmistakable scent of death oozing from beneath the door, I couldn’t look away from rat's paw. Its distress signal. I wanted to put it out of its misery immediately. The suffering was the worst part. I mustered the courage to bury my nose and do it but just before I turned the doorknob.



SNAP.



A piercing scream came from behind me. Stevie’s foot was gone. It broke through a brittle, blue tile on the floor and sunk its teeth into the boy’s shin so deep it could taste the marrow. The iron scent of blood erupted from the hole. Stevie gripped his calf with white knuckles and screamed hard enough to slice his vocal chords to ribbons, but even over the screams I could hear something. The sound echoed from the school's entrance and ricocheted to me from around the corner. Thick, deliberate footsteps.



I dropped to my knees at the hole and tried to pry the trap open. Once I saw a gap in the trap's jaws, my hands slipped in Stevie’s blood and it snapped shut on the wound sending another scream through his throat. Still, the footsteps got closer, until a figure turned the corner. The white elephant mask with a missing trunk was still strapped to his face. He stood as tall as the door frames. His chest was as broad as a truck grill. With the force of a buffalo he charged directly at us. The same leather canteen swung violently at his hip. I yanked the trap again and again. I didn’t care if I had to work the trap's jaws until it chewed Stevie’s foot off. He had to get free, we had to get out of there. 



Abigail tugged at my shirt and screamed with terrified tears streaking down her cheeks. The monster of a man was only a few feet from us when Lucas grabbed my shirt and slung me away from Stevie's leg. By the time I got to my feet, Trunkless was standing right behind the boy. The black eye slits in the mask aimed right at me. He raised his hand in the air and waved a subtle hello. I was frozen. Everyone, even Stevie, was still for an instant. Trunkless was the first to move. He gently wrapped his hand around the side of Stevie’s head and gouged space for his middle finger into his eye socket. Stevie squealed for him to stop but all the begging did was give him an opening to stuff the mouth of the canteen in. He dumped the liquid down Stevie's throat then jerked it back out. As Stevie coughed and stuttered the man wrapped his fingers around Stevie's bottom teeth and strained as he pulled on the mandible.



“We have to go” Lucas yanked me out of my paralysis and we sprinted down the hallway through the muffled pleading of Stevie and dipped into the first doorway that didn’t seem like a classroom, but before we could close the door the shrill screams were abruptly quieted by a pop.



I laid sprawled on the floor and ran my hands over the itchy carpet. The scratchy texture was enough to remind me that I could feel, that I was breathing. The ceiling above me was tiled. Some had protruding bellies of water.  Most were splotched brown like coffee stains. I counted the stains on beat to the thunderous metronome behind my ribs. One two three, four, five, six. Seven. Eight. Nine… ten…



Lucas already gathered himself enough to survey the room. His footsteps and the rattle of chained exit doors were the only sounds. I pinched my eyes shut and took a deep breath before I sat up to look around. Computers were spaced out on two long tables in the far corner of the room. Just expensive dust collectors without power. A cluster of organized tables and chairs stood close by. The rest of the room was books. Isles and isles of sturdy wooden bookshelf each stuffed with the bane of the school's former attendees. All of which had acquired the pleasing smell of aged paper. There was an indention in the carpet at the end of the nearest isle. The distinct print of a bookshelf where there wasn't one to be found. Lucas chuckled like he'd figured out the punchline to an unfunny prank.



“He waved at you.” He said. I didn't have to look at him. I could feel his burning eyes on me.



“Fist your locker and now he waves at you.”



“I didn't know.” I signed. I tried to suck the tears back but they already started to pool.



“Who is he? I'm sure you know that, don't you?” He snarled. I could only glance at him. His anger burned, but his quivering lip showed that the fire was fueled by fear. I couldn't say anything. Of course I had no idea he would be here but if I told them who he was, would they leave me? The only other friend I ever had was stalking the halls covered in a kid's blood. I would be alone again. Such an awful place.



“You convinced us to come here. You wanted to get something and you sure as shit got it didn't you? What did we do to deserve this, Holly?” I shook my head violently to dodge his accusation. The pools in my eyes overflowed before Abigail saw what was happening and jumped between us.



“Lucas. We are stuck here. All three of us and if we want to get out, we can't be an asshole. We need some trust. Okay?” Abigail signed to him. Lucas swallowed some of his hatred and thought. His sister was always his soft spot.



“Okay, but she needs to give me a reason to.” He looked past Abigail and back at me.



“Why are we here?” He asked. The truth sounded so absurd now. I'm supposed to tell them I got us locked in with a murderer and got a boy killed over a dumb class project from over a decade ago? I couldn't make my hands say anything.



‘She's just shy.’ My mother's words echoed in my head. The only words I remember her saying. Lucas scoffed and walked away from us. Abigail sat next to me and rested her shoulder and head against mine.



“I’m sorry about him. You don’t really know that monster do you?” She signed. I wanted to tell her everything. I always wanted to tell her everything, but I couldn’t shake the knot of dread that formed in my stomach at the thought of doing so. Alone, such an awful place.



“I didn’t know. I didn’t know.” was all I could sign.



“I'm here.” She repeated to me in a calming whisper.



“Holly. Get Abigail and come here.” Lucas demanded. I composed myself the best I could and brought Abigail over. Lucas was standing at an open door. What was on the other side of the door was too dark to be an exit. Far too dark. Just enough moonlight came through the windows of the library to see stairs leading down. The concrete stairs ended abruptly at a waterline so calm it could've been mistaken as frozen.



We were concerned at first but realized whatever microscopic horrors swam around in the flooded basement were nothing compared to the one lurking in the halls. Abigail went down first. She kept her hearing aids in a tight fist above her head and used her other hand to grab Lucas’. He then offered his free hand to me. I hesitated.



“Trust.” He said. The word made me nauseous, but I took his hand and covered our tracks by closing the door behind us.

  


The water swallowed us from feet to naval. Darkness was all around us. All of my existence was a frigid chill soaked up through my spine, the sloshing of legs, and Lucas’ grip around my wrist. All I could do was follow his pull. I fluttered my free hand through the air to find some clue as to where we were until it collided with a massive tank. It rang a hollow twang after my knuckle blindly hit  it. Lucas gave my arm a stern jerk and at the same time, something coiled around my foot and tripped. I thrashed my arms beneath the water to keep my head from submerging beneath the disease festered water. Once I regained my balance I kicked the thing that tripped me into my hand. With the all-consuming darkness taking my vision, I ran my fingers over it to learn what it was. The unmoving serpentine shape ended in an open mouth with rivets for lips. A hose, I realized. I also realized that I wasn’t being pulled anymore. There were no fingers wrapped around my wrist. Lucas let go.



Hinges squealed from further inside the room and ended with a door closed. My first instinct was to splash. To shoot my audio flare for rescue but just as I raised my arms I heard something else. Two claps. I knew it wasn’t them, the sound was too thick, too expecting. Trunkless waited for me to fill in my part. I stayed silent. My feet were anchored to the floor and I hoped that Abigail and Lucas did the same, wherever they were. Something stepped into the water and I pinched every muscle in my face to keep a yelp from escaping. The water stilled after a moment.



Clap… clap…



My nerves prodded every muscle in my body to flee. My resolve was failing but before it completely caved, I escaped in thought. I thought of Abigail and I finding a way out of this school. I thought of leaving this place in a cloud of dust behind our tires and going to a concert. Abigail loved concerts. The crowd pounded the beat into the ground, the speakers blasted the music until it rattled in her chest. The sound was all-encompassing, to the point that even without ears, she could hear it. I imagined dancing with her in the crowd. It was one of the places we felt included. Like the world was made to fit us in. Like I wasn’t alone.



CLAP, CLAP.



The sound snapped me out of thought with a boom to my eardrum. I shrieked and tried to run but his hands quickly crushed my upper arm. He dragged me behind him through the water. I struggled to get my mouth above the water for air. Drowning became my biggest worry until I heard the thud of his boot hit a stair through the splashes. He hoisted me out of the water like I weighed nothing. The hinges squealed again and just before he threw me into the unknown I caught a glimpse of Lucas as he pulled Abigail back into the moonlit library.

Thank you for sticking by me over the years. For the hugs, listening when I ramble during coffee, always letting me sit at your table.

I know we don’t talk outside of [group name] but our last conversation really stuck with me.

No one has ever looked at me after listening to my story (of how I got here in life) and followed up with a question the way that you did.

I usually feel like motherhood is more of a life sentence than just one aspect of my life. It feels like I always have to put everyone’s wants, needs, and interests above my own. And knowing you’re thinking like this even when you do it all on your own is incredible. 

You are an inspiration. 

Thank you for challenging me to be more for myself. To do more for myself.

I made a game plan. Suddenly, it seems so feasible because I’m just focused for fun, not for a specific timeline and not for a career but just to make myself happy. It’s attainable. It’s in my grasp. 

I’m doing it. I may not be where I thought I would be but maybe this was why? 

If I had followed that original path I would have never met you. We would never have had these amazing coffee conversations. We wouldn’t laugh or cry together with all the girls at [group name] and I’m so glad that everything happened this way.

I know for a fact that the relationships we have made over the past 3 years are more genuine than I would have ever encountered if I had stayed on my original path.

- the cheap gear that works fine (i use a $5 plastic       thingy)

- the one fancy step you actually gotta do (let the coffee fart)

- what to do when your brew tastes like regret:

problem: tastes sour? -> solution: grind finer, you coward.

problem: tastes bitter? -> grind coarser, you maniac.


if you’re a coffee pro this will make you cry.
if you’re a normal person who just wants better coffee, this is for you.

1oq74ta,https://i.redd.it/hnodpawxkozf1.jpeg,The Asian server is borderline unplayable.,"Regular multiplayer on the Asian server is filled with probably 80-90% bots in regular official server lobbies, that never get fully populated. If you try to play REDSEC, it will take you 10-20 minutes for a lobby to fill, and most are just MORE Chinese bots who spam a link to whatever this website is, and as soon as the game starts they all just leave the lobby so their accounts can't get reported.

For context, I have only ever used a Nespresso or AeroPress at home so I have pretty much no knowledge on how to use an espresso machine, but am willing to learn. I work from home so I have time to make my coffee, and I prefer a latte with cashew milk! My fiancé also used to be a barista so he’s familiar with machines. 

I’ve seen many recommend the Bambino Plus and getting a standalone grinder to go with it, but the Express Impress does pique my interest since it has everything available in one. I don’t expect having to make back to back cups often, maybe just 2 for myself and my fiancé each day if we happen to want our coffee at the same time. 

Any suggestions on which I should go with? Pros and cons of one vs the other? Trying to figure it out so I can take advantage of any Black Friday sales. Thanks in advance!!",2,1762454462.0,BrevilleCoffee,3,1.0,False

August, 2015

Golden sweet corn rained onto my tray with a salty butter shine. Green beans dipped  into their shallow pool of chicken broth, garlic, diced onion, and bacon. The beans made their presence known with a mouthwatering steam. A mound of potatoes plopped onto the tray and was pressed into a caldera with the back end of the cook's spoon. The divot was filled till it overflowed with a heavenly brown gravy. Last came the pork. A pork with the tenderness of a pudding and the taste of Hawaiian basted honey. Each cut of meat was so fresh it caused rumors that the meat was butchered in the kitchen. I believed them too. Lunch was the best part of St. Jude Catholic School. Unfortunately, it was followed by the worst.

Once our bellies were stuffed to the brim we were banished to the school yard for recess. Fresh cut grass poisoned the air. Summer still burned at the beginning of the school year and the sun blasted a bright sting to the back of my eyes. The day wasn’t made for me. My days were when it rained and we could go to the library to enjoy the silence while the talking boys released their energy into the gym. But days like this were ruled by the talking boys. They squealed and screeched as kick balls and whiffle balls torpedoed through the air. The other girls that weren’t interested in joining the boys usually huddled by the school building telling jokes and updating each other on the latest gossip. I would listen with my back to them. Whenever I heard something especially juicy I would sign my response close to my chest so they didn’t see. I wished I could turn and share all of the gossip I overheard, the benefits of not being noticed. I knew Darren found his dad's booze and planned to bring a bottle to school that week. I knew Bianca got into it with her mom the night before because she was failing math. I imagined they would get a kick out of that. Maybe they'd even be my friend if they understood me but they wouldn't, no one would.

The school yard became unusually quiet. A group of boys huddled at the fence that separated us from the woods. What they saw captured their attention and sewed their mouths shut, at least until they scurried away to giggle in small groups. Not all of them were so amused with the subject beyond the fence. Most looked confused but some even looked concerned. Piece by piece the huddle of children broke back into their daily play until I could get a peek at what it was they were so interested in. On the other side of the fence, crouched beneath the shadows of the woods, was a boy.

He looked each boy in the eye when he asked them to play. It felt like a plea, a desperate attempt to find a friend. The boys didn’t care though, how could they? The boy in the woods spoke in a tongue they didn’t understand. Like me, he spoke with no tongue at all. It was a lonely way to speak in this school. Alone was a hard place to be in eighth grade. After seeing him I felt we could be there together.

When the last boy peeled away I walked to the fence. With each step I felt more emboldened, more hopeful to finally have a friend.

‘I can’t talk to you, I need normal friends.’

The words echoed from moments I had the same urge in the past. But this time had to be different. He was like me, he would understand me.

‘Aren’t you contagious, Holly?’ I shook my head and tried to keep the past away like a swarm of bees, but they kept stinging.

‘What are you doing with your hands, weirdo?’

‘Go away, people will think I’m weird too if you’re next to me.’

‘Did God make you broken on purpose?’

I was stuck half way to the fence. All the sounds of the school yard vanished behind the words. This was a stupid idea. No one wanted to be my friend. Why did I even walk this far? What a waste. I turned around to go back and pretend I was like the other girls. I wanted to smile when they smiled and laughed when they laughed without the embarrassment of having them see me, but my mom’s voice cut through the swarm.

‘She’s just shy.’

I knew she wasn’t our supervisor that day. The girls wouldn’t have talked quite as loud and the boys wouldn’t have played quite as hard if she was. Chipper, as the other kids called her in whispers, held the reputation of a drill sergeant when she wore the habit. The type of nun to crack a ruler across your knuckles if you misbehaved during her prime years. Though, the main reason she earned the brand ‘Chipper’ was the small chip missing from her front tooth.

‘She’s just shy.’ Her voice replayed in my head.

Her catchphrase when anyone asked about me. Why doesn’t she talk? She’s just shy. What happened to her? She’s just shy. It was a simpler explanation than the truth. A less shameful statement than the truth, I was born like this. But I’m not shy, or at least I refuse to be. I closed my eyes and took a first step towards the boy. The yard got a little quieter as the other kids vacated the area around the boy in the woods. When I felt the beating sun disappear behind the shade of the trees I stopped and waited for a moment.

‘I’m not shy.’ I thought to myself but before I had the courage to open my eyes, the fence rattled.

The clatter of the chain-linked fence stopped with the stomp of feet meeting the ground. Step by step he came closer until I heard his heavy, phlegm-rattled breath just in front of me. With one final reassurance I opened my eyes. Immediately, I knew why the other kids avoided him.

He was big. Much bigger than the other boys in our grade. Most of the boys were just sprouting the first seedlings of hair on their forearm while his forearms were already coated. A leather canteen dangled from his belt. His chest and shoulders stood at my eye level and were noticeably broad even under his tattered gray jacket. Hair even started to sprout on his neck just below his white mask, a detail I hadn’t noticed across the yard. An elephant mask made cheap and pressed to his face with a single elastic string that ran in an eroded divot around his head before it vanished into the cave of his gray jacket’s hood. In the center where the trunk should be was only a hole. The jagged edges of the plastic hole encircled a void too deep to see any detail of his face through. My breath stuttered. This person could hurt me, or take me, or do anything else he wanted and I would be helpless. I could scream at the top of my lungs for help but only a strained whine from my over tightened vocal chords would escape. No one would hear that. Hell, I wasn’t even sure he would hear it. I knew my only option was to run but when I took a glance behind me to plan my escape he raised his hand.

He exposed the dry, callused skin of his palm to me. It stayed suspended in the air for a moment before he slowly brought the tips of his fingers towards me. Gently, they landed on my throat. Each of his five fingerprints carefully scraped up and down. I wanted to say something but I couldn’t get my hands to move. I tried to get something to escape my mouth, but I only felt my throat strain under his touch. Finally he removed his hand and signed a single word. A word that I hadn’t heard anyone say to me. A word that turned off all the alarms blaring in my head. 

“Beautiful.” He signed.

October, 2023

 

The pond was no wider than twelve feet and smelled like frankincense and sweet licorice. Grass around the pond grew high, and hid something on the other side of the water. Between tufts of grass, a smokey gray shape laid still on the ground. I thought it was a discarded fur coat until I noticed its two beady eyes fixated on me from its white, cone-shaped head.

“What is that, Holly?” Abigail asked.

I loved the sound of her voice. The way it stumbled from one note to the next without guidance. She only used it when we were alone so I knew her brother already ventured beyond earshot. Still, it was conflicting. While I loved our secret it was too wonderful to not be shared, something she stiffly refused to do.

“I think it is an opossum."" I signed.

“Geez. Do you think it’s sick? Should we help it?” Abigail asked. Her hands anxiously scratched at her jeans. 

“Maybe it is just playing dead?” I signed. As if on cue a crow landed just behind the opossum's head and disappeared behind the grass. When the crows head resurfaced, it did with a string of red, slick entrails. It clapped its beak around the guts until it cut a bite out and let the rest flop back to the ground. Abigail’s lip turned in a shocked disgust.

“Method.” I signed. Abigail gave me a jab from her elbow and a laugh, the most wonderful secret of all.

“Holly! You two are supposed to stay close! Get Abigail and follow the sound!” Abigail’s older brother Lucas called before a metallic rattle screeched through the air. He was about twenty three, two years older than Abigail and I. He wouldn’t get any older if he kept up the racket. Abigail watched the annoyance on my face and waited for me to relay the message.

“Your brother is being an idiot.” I signed to her before I held her hand. We rushed through the woods to Lucas. As we ran I kept thinking about the opossum. Even after the crow ripped at its entrails, I swore it blinked.

When we emerged from the woods, Lucas had the chain link fence clutched in both of his fists and was shaking it rapidly. He only stopped when I hit him with a swift slap to the shoulder.

“Hey, what the hell!” He said.

“You know this is illegal right? Are you trying to get caught?” I signed. He glanced at Abigail briefly who was focused on our lips.

“By who? No one is here. Are the birds going to rat us out? Or maybe the squirrels."" He said and signed.

For the first time in years I looked beyond the chain linked fence. Across the overgrown schoolyard was the husk that was once called St. Jude Catholic School. As a kid I always thought the school was shaped like a stale, square bagel. A barren courtyard of a hole was encircled by the depressing corridors and classrooms. It was divided into four sections, each with their own special landmarks. The south side had the main entrance. The East Section had the cafeteria and library. The West Section had the pool and gymnasium and the north, the section we were facing, had the theater. A tiny access door peaked over the edge of the theater’s roof like a timid child.

After the incident, the school tried to reassure the parents by hefty investments in security. All glass was reinforced and every window was fortified with steel bars, but it was too little too late. The parents and their precious tuition money already migrated with their kids to the rival Catholic school upstate. St. Jude was left to succumb to the vines and weather. The corpse looked more like an abandoned prison than a school

“Or maybe the rats will.” Lucas whispered. The thought made my spine wriggle.

“I hope whatever you’re looking for is worth it.” Lucas said as he stomped a path for us through the waist high grass.

It was.

We walked around the school building to get to the entrance. At the entrance was a figure. It sat against the front door cloaked in a gray jacket. I felt every muscle in my body constrict at once. Abigail turned to ask what was wrong and all I could do was gesture towards the figure. She immediately tapped Lucas on the shoulder to point his attention towards the mysterious man. The figure eased itself to its feet when it saw us. It waved. A wild wave with arms flapping like the tube men at car dealerships. Then he dropped his hood. To my relief, there was no mask. Only a face, a boyish face. A face I had never seen before and judging by the look on Abigail’s she hadn’t either. Lucas turned to us with an eye roll and motioned us to the boy.

He couldn’t have been older than sixteen. His brunette hair waved chaotically at the top of his bean-pole body. His skin was still plagued with the red specs of puberty, and atop his lip was his most prized possession. A crown of ten scraggly hairs.

“Lucas!...Ladies.” He said with all the charm a boy drowning in supermarket cologne could muster. Abigail took the hearing aids from her ears and stowed them away in her pocket. ‘They don’t even help that much’ she would say if I asked why, but I knew that wasn’t true. I stopped asking and just assured her with a touch on the back.

“Stevie, where’s your brother?” Lucas shot at the kid.

“He got called into work tonight but don’t worry. I’ll get us through safe, I’m like the Outdoor Boys of buildings.” Stevie said.

“I don’t see the gear. Your brother was supposed to bring the gear.” Lucas asked.

“Eh, who needs it anyway. It can’t be that hard.” Stevie proclaimed. Lucas pinched the exhaustion from his brow.

“You have your license?” Lucas asked.

“I got it a couple months ago, thank you for asking.”

“Then drive home.” Lucas said. He put a shoulder to the door.

“I can’t-” 

Lucas heaved the metal door open with a creek followed by the clatter of aluminum cans on the concrete stoop.

“I’ve been drinking.” Stevie finished.

The smell of stagnant, musty water filled the building. Puddles spotted the tile floor and grew with a rhythmic drip. The entryway ran perpendicular to the south section hallway. At their intersection was a trophy case with only smashed glass to show.

The last couple of weeks before the school closed were a blur. Teachers at first tried to maintain the illusion of safety but as the halls grew more and more empty, they gave up the act. Everyone was scared except for me. I just went through the motions, a passenger in my own body. As I reentered the remains of the school I could only wonder if it really was worth it. Where had I even had it last? Maybe my locker? It was as good a place to check first as any. I just wanted to get out of there as soon as possible. I wasn’t a passenger anymore, I felt the fear.

“What are you thinking?” Abigail signed to me as we walked down the hallway. She always seemed to know the answer, she read plain as day on my face. Still, she wanted to know what I would say.

“It is just like I remember.” I signed to her with a smile. As we passed locker after locker I noticed that each one had a dent. A softball size dent near the latch that left them ajar by the thinnest crack. The further we went the more I noticed a splotch or a smear of brown stained blood in the dents. When we turned the corner to the East Section when I heard a rattle come from behind us. I snapped my head around to see nothing besides the damp floor tiles and busted lockers we’d passed since we turned the corner.

“-right ladies?” Stevie shouted before he spun around to look at us while he walked backwards. To that moment, I almost forgot he and Lucas were blubbering to each other ahead of us. He waited for a response while the alcohol that sloshed around in his pinky-thin body made him forget his land legs. Had they heard the rattle too? 

“Did he say something?” Abigail signed to me. Stevie was zapped into a panic. He blocked his mouth from our sight.

“Dude, you can’t bring deaf people. They’re gonna get hurt. What the hell is wrong with you?” He said to Lucas who jabbed him in the ribs with his elbow.

“Holly’s mute you dipshit, she can hear you.”

Stevie gathered his wind in a breath before giving a silent, bewildered chuckle to himself. He lagged behind Lucas to get out of his sight. He then raised his hand and mimed like he held something pointed directly at me. Then he popped his thumb down like he pressed the mute button on a TV remote. He winked and turned to catch up to Lucas.

‘She’s just shy.’ My mother’s voice echoed again. After the incident, I learned not to argue with it.

Abigail tugged on my shirt sleeve and pointed to the locker beside us. 

“It ends.” She signed.

Like the others before it, it was dented and stained in blood but each locker beyond it was strangely left untouched. Even stranger, this locker was mine. I opened it. 

“Did you find what you’re looking for?"" Lucas asked, but all that was in my locker were chilling words smeared in blood on the back wall that read ‘YOU PROMISSED’.

I sprinted as fast as I could back the way we came. I cut around the corner, flew through the lobby and smashed my weight against the push-bar on the door but it didn’t budge. The doors were locked. A metal chain knotted around the door, sealed shut with a padlock.

May, 2016

Shelly was behind by the length of a grass blade and the finish line twig was only a couple inches away. It was still anyone’s race. Rain washed the school yard that morning. The smell of potting soil leaked from the bags stacked between the garden shed and the school yard fence. A colony of snails slid on the bags, ready to be drafted into the snail race. Mine was always named Shelly, as it always was. I thought of it like the lead in a Broadway play, though they’re each their own actress, they all wanted to be Shelly. Trunkless didn’t give names to his snails. He never gave me his name either. So in my mind he became Trunkless for the hole in his elephant mask. It was fitting enough. Trunkless never gave his snails a name either. Instead, he gave them a crack. When he found a snail he liked for the day he popped a slit into the shell with his thumbnail. It was as casual to him as shaking a hand. The ease with which he split their shells made me nauseous. When we first started racing snails I asked him why he did it, but the answer was simple. Like the hole in his elephant mask and splits in his knuckles he just liked them better broken, like us.

After many snail races we developed a system. We took turns clapping for our snails, usually in two. I would clap twice. He would clap twice. It was a brilliant idea in concept. Chaperones would only hear the continuous claps of one kid, but we never got the timing right in practice. The awkward pause between our claps was hilariously obvious even after a full year of trying. We stopped trying to make it convincing and it became only a silly tradition while we watched the snails run their foot long marathon, I often got more consumed in the rhythm than the race itself

“Look.” He signed.

I came up with the idea of picking a juicy tomato slice off of my lunch sandwich and stowing it in my pocket to use as motivation beyond the finish line twig. As disappointing as it was to devolve my BLT into a BL, it was proving worth it. Not only were both snails participating, but it was a nail biter. Shelly surged into the lead with only an inch to go. I clapped and waved her forward frantically. He did the same for his snail that started to slip behind, but it was too late. Shelly slipped over the twig to take gold by the thinnest of margins. I jumped up and applauded for the whole yard to hear at the peak athleticism on display. I bent down to get a look at the little olympian as she climbed onto her delicious, red prize.

SQUELCH.

In an instant, Shelly and the tomato were beneath the stubby heel of a black leather shoe. My mother’s shoe. I looked up her habit to see her face, I was shocked to see she didn’t seem angry in the slightest. Her cheeks were flushed with fear. She snatched me by the arm in a vice grip. Her finger tips dug into my skin deep enough to bruise but still I tried to fight it. I knew we would be forbidden from going behind the garden shed. With no other place to hide in the open school yard, I didn’t think I’d ever see him again. That meant no more snail races, no more picking honeysuckles from the bush that grew through the fence, no more friends. I would be back to being an outcast. The quiet kid that no one understood. The broken girl. So I kept fighting which only made my mom’s grip tighter. She blew the whistle around her neck.

“Everyone get inside now! Get inside!” She screamed. I fought until I was pulled back into the school building and the door slammed shut behind us. The only person that brought me any joy was sealed behind it.

The school felt like it was on lockdown for the rest of the day. Nuns monitored the halls between classes and no one was allowed to use the restroom without an adult escort. When the day came to an end I laid on the bleachers by the pool. It was an indoor pool attached to the gymnasium by a single set of double doors. The stinging stench of chlorine cleansed my soul after a particularly taxing day. After school events were canceled that afternoon so there was no splashing from the swim team or shrill tennis shoe chirps from the gym. It was just me and the soothing hum of the pool jets. I spent most of the time looking up through the sunroof. Clouds, birds, and airplanes eased in and out of the glass frame. If I wasn’t looking at the sky I admired the abomination on the wall. A mural, painted with the artistic vision of a blind ape, stained the pearlescent white paint. I assumed it was supposed to be a collage of professional swimmers, but I only thought that because the center-most figure had a vague resemblance to a picture of Michael Phelps I saw once.

“What are you still doing here?” a creaky voice called from the doorway to the gymnasium. A janitor with a spindly gray beard and age-spotted scalp hunched over his trach bin on wheels like a walker. He wasn’t any of the regular janitors I saw throughout the school day. He must have been part of the evening crew.

“What time is it?” I signed, but he kept glaring at me. Of course he didn’t understand. I could practically hear the accusations banging around in his head. I threw my hands up and walked past him. I heard the squeak of his trash bin trailing behind me through my walk of shame to the main entrance.

“I know your face, little girl!” He spat as I swung the door open.

The front of the school was empty. Aside from the occasional bird song it was silent. It was a sticky heat with the smell of rain starting to roll in. stepped out and walked around the building to the parking lot. The lot was empty aside from one car. My mothers. Was she waiting on me? The thought of making her wait this long made me dread getting in the car to receive my scolding. As I stepped into the parking lot I caught a glimpse of a figure standing in the schoolyard. It was Trunkless with his canteen at his hip. He waved me to come towards him.

“I have to show you something.” He signed. I was ecstatic. All day I thought I may never get to see my friend again. Without hesitation I hopped the fence and went to him.

“Where is it?” I signed.

“Just behind the garden shed, but you have to promise me something.”

“Anything.” I signed with a smile.

“You can not tell anyone about this.” I hesitated, but promised with a smile. He nodded and popped the cap off of his canteen. Then he led me behind the shed.

October, 2023

“What the fuck, dude? You all got to stop fucking with me man this isn’t funny!” Stevie whined. I was in disbelief. We were just there, we opened the door only a few minutes ago and in that small amount of time, we were chained in. I held the padlock against my palm. It was warm. Someone locked us in. He locked us in. The thought made my head spin as it wrapped around the danger we were in. Abigail’s touched my shoulder.

“Is there another way out of here?” She signed. I swallowed the sick feeling when I saw her and kept it down long enough to think. Each of the three other sections had at least one exit. The cafeteria and library in the East Section each had one. The theater in the North Section had one, and the pool and gymnasium in the West Section had one each. I stood and turned to the group. Lucas racked his brain for some kind of plan. Stevie paced and swore to God that he'd quit drinking if he got out of there in one piece. I signed to Abigail and Lucas about the other exits. Stevie was desperate to know but Lucas only told him to follow. We crept back down the hall. Lucas led the pack with Abigail and I behind him. Each of us kept a careful eye on each door we passed. Stevie stayed behind us as he was told and kept his mind occupied by tight-rope walking a strip of blue tile on the floor. It wasn’t a helpful task but anything to keep his mouth shut was useful to me.

Lucas peeked through the slim glass window on the first classroom door beyond my locker and winced away from it.

He looked back at Abigail and I and shook his head. I couldn’t resist though. I cupped my hands over my eyes and looked in. The rat’s paw scratched at the tile floor. Not a desperate scratch, but an unfolding and refolding of its paws to a steady rhythm. The tile just seemed to get in the way of its claws. Blood stained the corners of the rat's mouth. Its ear flicked away the hoard of flies convinced of its death, and they should have been right. The rat was severed in half. The open wound spilled the animal’s entrails into a hole behind it. All that jutted from the hole was a bear trap’s exposed metal teeth in a crimson-stained grin. Despite the grizzly sight and the unmistakable scent of death oozing from beneath the door, I couldn’t look away from rat's paw. Its distress signal. I wanted to put it out of its misery immediately. The suffering was the worst part. I mustered the courage to bury my nose and do it but just before I turned the doorknob.

SNAP.

A piercing scream came from behind me. Stevie’s foot was gone. It broke through a brittle, blue tile on the floor and sunk its teeth into the boy’s shin so deep it could taste the marrow. The iron scent of blood erupted from the hole. Stevie gripped his calf with white knuckles and screamed hard enough to slice his vocal chords to ribbons, but even over the screams I could hear something. The sound echoed from the school's entrance and ricocheted to me from around the corner. Thick, deliberate footsteps.

I dropped to my knees at the hole and tried to pry the trap open. Once I saw a gap in the trap's jaws, my hands slipped in Stevie’s blood and it snapped shut on the wound sending another scream through his throat. Still, the footsteps got closer, until a figure turned the corner. The white elephant mask with a missing trunk was still strapped to his face. He stood as tall as the door frames. His chest was as broad as a truck grill. With the force of a buffalo he charged directly at us. The same leather canteen swung violently at his hip. I yanked the trap again and again. I didn’t care if I had to work the trap's jaws until it chewed Stevie’s foot off. He had to get free, we had to get out of there. 

Abigail tugged at my shirt and screamed with terrified tears streaking down her cheeks. The monster of a man was only a few feet from us when Lucas grabbed my shirt and slung me away from Stevie's leg. By the time I got to my feet, Trunkless was standing right behind the boy. The black eye slits in the mask aimed right at me. He raised his hand in the air and waved a subtle hello. I was frozen. Everyone, even Stevie, was still for an instant. Trunkless was the first to move. He gently wrapped his hand around the side of Stevie’s head and gouged space for his middle finger into his eyesocket. Stevie squealed for him to stop but all the begging did was give him an opening to stuff the mouth of the canteen in. He dumped the liquid down Stevie's throat then jerked it back out. As Stevie coughed and stuttered the man wrapped his fingers around Stevie's bottom teeth and strained as he pulled on the mandible.

“We have to go” Lucas yanked me out of my paralysis and we sprinted down the hallway through the muffled pleading of Stevie and dipped into the first doorway that didn’t seem like a classroom, but before we could close the door the shrill screams were abruptly quieted by a pop.

I laid sprawled on the floor and ran my hands over the itchy carpet. The scratchy texture was enough to remind me that I could feel, that I was breathing. The ceiling above me was tiled. Some had protruding bellies of water.  Most were splotched brown like coffee stains. I counted the stains on beat to the thunderous metronome behind my ribs. One two three, four, five, six. Seven. Eight. Nine… ten…

Lucas already gathered himself enough to survey the room. His footsteps and the rattle of chained exit doors were the only sounds. I pinched my eyes shut and took a deep breath before I sat up to look around. Computers were spaced out on two long tables in the far corner of the room. Just expensive dust collectors without power. A cluster of organized tables and chairs stood close by. The rest of the room was books. Isles and isles of sturdy wooden bookshelf each stuffed with the bane of the school's former attendees. All of which had acquired the pleasing smell of aged paper. There was an indention in the carpet at the end of the nearest isle. The distinct print of a bookshelf where there wasn't one to be found. Lucas chuckled like he'd figured out the punchline to an unfunny prank.

“He waved at you.” He said. I didn't have to look at him. I could feel his burning eyes on me.

“Fist your locker and now he waves at you.”

“I didn't know.” I signed. I tried to suck the tears back but they already started to pool.

“Who is he? I'm sure you know that, don't you?” He snarled. I could only glance at him. His anger burned, but his quivering lip showed that the fire was fueled by fear. I couldn't say anything. Of course I had no idea he would be here but if I told them who he was, would they leave me? The only other friend I ever had was stalking the halls covered in a kid's blood. I would be alone again. Such an awful place.

“You convinced us to come here. You wanted to get something and you sure as shit got it didn't you? What did we do to deserve this, Holly?” I shook my head violently to dodge his accusation. The pools in my eyes overflowed before Abigail saw what was happening and jumped between us.

“Lucas. We are stuck here. All three of us and if we want to get out, we can't be an asshole. We need some trust. Okay?” Abigail signed to him. Lucas swallowed some of his hatred and thought. His sister was always his soft spot.

“Okay, but she needs to give me a reason to.” He looked past Abigail and back at me.

“Why are we here?” He asked. The truth sounded so absurd now. I'm supposed to tell them I got us locked in with a murderer and got a boy killed over a dumb class project from over a decade ago? I couldn't make my hands say anything.

‘She's just shy.’ My mother's words echoed in my head. The only words I remember her saying. Lucas scoffed and walked away from us. Abigail sat next to me and rested her shoulder and head against mine.

“I’m sorry about him. You don’t really know that monster do you?” She signed. I wanted to tell her everything. I always wanted to tell her everything, but I couldn’t shake the knot of dread that formed in my stomach at the thought of doing so. Alone, such an awful place.

“I didn’t know. I didn’t know.” was all I could sign.

“I'm here.” She repeated to me in a calming whisper.

“Holly. Get Abigail and come here.” Lucas demanded. I composed myself the best I could and brought Abigail over. Lucas was standing at an open door. What was on the other side of the door was too dark to be an exit. Far too dark. Just enough moonlight came through the windows of the library to see stairs leading down. The concrete stairs ended abruptly at a waterline so calm it could've been mistaken as frozen.

We were concerned at first but realized whatever microscopic horrors swam around in the flooded basement were nothing compared to the one lurking in the halls. Abigail went down first. She kept her hearing aids in a tight fist above her head and used her other hand to grab Lucas’. He then offered his free hand to me. I hesitated.

“Trust.” He said. The word made me nauseous, but I took his hand and covered our tracks by closing the door behind us.

The water swallowed us from feet to naval. Darkness was all around us. All of my existence was a frigid chill soaked up through my spine, the sloshing of legs, and Lucas’ grip around my wrist. All I could do was follow his pull. I fluttered my free hand through the air to find some clue as to where we were until it collided with a massive tank. It rang a hollow twang after my knuckle blindly hit  it. Lucas gave my arm a stern jerk and at the same time, something coiled around my foot and tripped. I thrashed my arms beneath the water to keep my head from submerging beneath the disease festered water. Once I regained my balance I kicked the thing that tripped me into my hand. With the all-consuming darkness taking my vision, I ran my fingers over it to learn what it was. The unmoving serpentine shape ended in an open mouth with rivets for lips. A hose, I realized. I also realized that I wasn’t being pulled anymore. There were no fingers wrapped around my wrist. Lucas let go.

Hinges squealed from further inside the room and ended with a door closed. My first instinct was to splash. To shoot my audio flare for rescue but just as I raised my arms I heard something else. Two claps. I knew it wasn’t them, the sound was too thick, too expecting. Trunkless waited for me to fill in my part. I stayed silent. My feet were anchored to the floor and I hoped that Abigail and Lucas did the same, wherever they were. Something stepped into the water and I pinched every muscle in my face to keep a yelp from escaping. The water stilled after a moment.

Clap… clap…

My nerves prodded every muscle in my body to flee. My resolve was failing but before it completely caved, I escaped in thought. I thought of Abigail and I finding a way out of this school. I thought of leaving this place in a cloud of dust behind our tires and going to a concert. Abigail loved concerts. The crowd pounded the beat into the ground, the speakers blasted the music until it rattled in her chest. The sound was all-encompassing, to the point that even without ears, she could hear it. I imagined dancing with her in the crowd. It was one of the places we felt included. Like the world was made to fit us in. Like I wasn’t alone.

CLAP, CLAP.

The sound snapped me out of thought with a boom to my eardrum. I shrieked and tried to run but his hands quickly crushed my upper arm. He dragged me behind him through the water. I struggled to get my mouth above the water for air. Drowning became my biggest worry until I heard the thud of his boot hit a stair through the splashes. He hoisted me out of the water like I weighed nothing. The hinges squealed again and just before he threw me into the unknown I caught a glimpse of Lucas as he pulled Abigail back into the moonlit library.

Now usually when I make this order, I'm eating in and can explain to them that I add protein shake to my cold brew in lieu of creamer and it's no big deal.  However, this morning my husband reported that the worker was concerned about serving just plain cold brew and then said to my husband ""Please don't drink this straight. Will you be adding something to it?"" which threw my husband through a loop. He explained what I do, got approval from the employee and went about bringing me my order.

But now I'm intrigued. Why can't one simply drink the cold brew straight? What witchcraft is in this this coffee that needs to be diluted with a creamer? I appreciate their concern for my obvious caffeine dependency; I guess that's just part of the Chic Fil A customer service we all know and love. Anyone else have an interaction similar to this?

UTICA, N.Y. -- The Bosnian American Community Association is set to unveil the Sebilj, a traditional Bosnian fountain, in Utica.

The grand opening ceremony will occur at 1 p.m. on Saturday, Nov. 22, at 1304 Albany St.

The Sebilj, inspired by the historic fountain in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, symbolizes community, heritage and unity.

Hanka Grabovica, president of the Bosnian American Community Association, said, ""The Sebilj is more than a monument—it’s a piece of our soul.""

“It honors our heritage, celebrates our contributions to this City, and symbolizes the friendship between the Bosnian community and the people of Utica,” she added.

The celebration will feature guest speakers, a ribbon-cutting ceremony and traditional Bosnian coffee and desserts.

When I went inside they were preparing for the service. Me and my dad sat at the back, and shortly before starting a man walked up to us. He explained some stuff about the church that we might need to know as newcomers and gave us the opportunity to ask questions. I commented on the stained-glass windows at the back by the altar. He allowed me to come closer and explained a bit about them. One of the windows was brought back to the USA from a French church during World War II. The other one he told me about was commissioned by a local industrialist a few decades ago. The church was small and felt cozy. There weren’t many people, but I think it helped ease the stress. There was a nice man behind us who’d help me and my father if we ever lost track and provided us with any papers we might’ve missed (such as the service schedule since we accidentally grabbed the wrong one 😅). I really enjoyed the structure of the service. It’s a nice change from the megachurch I grew up in and reminded me and my father of a Catholic mass (neither of us are Catholic, but the last church we visited was a Catholic church so it was easy to notice the similarities). When the service was over they invited us for coffee hour, but I declined since we had limited time and neither me nor my father are a fan of coffee.
Overall, everyone there was welcoming and kind. This is probably one of the most welcoming churches I’ve ever been to in my town. I’m not Christian, but I’ve already asked one of my family members to take me again sometime!",17,1762453049.0,Episcopalian,5,1.0,False
1oq6guo,https://www.reddit.com/r/BigLawRecruiting/comments/1oq6guo/foreign_lawyer_coffee_with_bl_partner_vibe_check/,Foreign lawyer coffee with BL partner- vibe check please,"Hi all. This post is a hot mess as I work out what to do.

A BL partner has agreed to a coffee with me next week because I worked with one of his siblings overseas. I'm a foreign lawyer here on a green card, taking the bar in Feb26 without the need to do an LLM. My experience overseas was mostly in niche government areas but in a common law country, and I was quite senior. I am aware cracking into any area of law, let alone BL, is an uphill battle for me, but this person is my only potential connection to the legal industry in nyc. 

From looking at the sub post history it seems coffee chats here are purely to make connections, and not sell yourself. I have already been upfront that the reason I reached out was to get help or tips on cracking into the legal market in this extremely competitive market (nyc), so I assume I dont raise it again when we meet  and I keep it informal? Also, how long does a coffee chat here usually go-  under 30 minutes given he's a partner? I'm the same age as the partner but basically ripped up my career when moving here for family, so I am sure we can chat family/age appropriate small talk for a while. Does this kind of stuff really help in the job hunt?  

Also, he knows I'm unemployed/studying for the bar  so I assume showing up in a tidier version of my normal outfit is acceptable ( jeans but smart sweater/coat/bag).
