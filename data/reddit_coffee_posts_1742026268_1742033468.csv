Hey, MaximizeMe family! 👋 Ever find yourself staring at the clock, wondering where your day just vanished? 😅 Well, that was me...until I stumbled upon a *game changer*. I like to call it the ""Time Freedom Combo"": daily rituals + time blocking. Here's how it gave me back 10 glorious hours a week!

**It all started with a cup of coffee...** ☕ Imagine this: Every morning, I sat with my steaming cup, thinking, ""Today will be different!"" Yet, by lunchtime, I'd be lost in emails or whatever distraction popped up. Sound familiar? Yup, same here. That's when I realized I needed more than good intentions—I needed a strategy.

**✨ Step 1: Embrace the Power of Daily Rituals**  
- **Magic Mornings:** These aren't just for Instagram. I carved out 30 minutes daily for things that *ignite* me—reading, journaling, or a brisk walk. It's less about the specific activity and more about starting the day on **my terms**.
- **Midday Mindfulness:** A 5-minute meditation before lunch? Total game-changer. Helps avoid the dreaded afternoon slump and keeps my mental gears oiled.

**💡 Step 2: Master the Art of Time Blocking**  
- **The ""3-Must-Do"" Method:** Each night, I jot down **three** absolute musts for the next day. I block out dedicated times to tackle these, avoiding the tempting pull of multitasking.
- **Theme Your Days:** Ever spent an entire day firefighting random tasks? Cue endless frustration. Instead, I started dedicating themes—e.g., Mondays for meetings, Thursdays for deep work. This minimizes task-switching overload.

**Lessons Learned & Tips**  
- Start small. I was super ambitious at first (like, planning my entire life in an Excel sheet). Spoiler: It didn’t go well. 😬
- Be flexible. My first instinct was to defend my schedule like a dragon guards its treasure. But life happens—gotta adapt.
- Reward yourself! Completed your time block? Celebrate with something you love. It's about progress, not perfection.

Honestly, combining rituals with time blocking isn’t just about productivity; it’s about freedom. 🕊️ It's freeing up time to do more of what you love, less of what drains you.

So, what’s your secret sauce for reclaiming your time? Looking forward to hearing your insights or any wild stories of scheduling bravery! Keep thriving, everyone! 🌟",1,1742032668.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False
1jbrpl3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1jbrpl3/quick_bitcoin_order_book_market_analysis_with/,⚡ Quick Bitcoin Order Book & Market Analysis with Your Morning Coffee ☕ 15 March 2025,"
Bitcoin is currently moving between two liquidity zones. Yesterday, we cleared the strong seller wall at $84,500, meaning this resistance no longer exists.

Now, we can see that institutional buyers have set up strong buy walls over the weekend, indicating a potential accumulation phase before the next move.

⸻

📉 Order Book & Key Liquidity Zones

🔹 Support Zones (Buy Orders):

✅ $83,000 – $83,200 → ~700 BTC in buy orders

✅ $82,500 – $82,800 → ~1,000 BTC in buy orders

✅ $81,500 – $81,800 → ~1,500 BTC in buy orders (largest buy wall)

💡 These are likely set by institutional players, not retail traders’ limit orders.

🔹 Resistance Zones (Sell Orders):

🚩 $87,500 → Massive sell wall with ~1,500 BTC

🚩 $88,000 → More than 1,000 BTC in short stop-loss orders

📌 Potential scenario:

If Bitcoin bounces from strong support zones, it will likely squeeze liquidity from short sellers at $87,000+ and possibly spike through $88,000 to clear stop losses.

⸻

📊 Trading Plan for Today

🎯 Strategy:

	•	Entering a short-term long from $83,500 – $82,500
	•	Targeting $87,000 – $88,000
	•	Exiting with a limit order, since a wick and sharp retracement are likely in that range

💡 Be cautious: Institutional players have set a “trap” around Bitcoin, holding it in their controlled liquidity zones. Weekends are highly manipulative—either range-bound or suddenly spiking up/down to liquidate both sides.

⸻

📢 Final Thoughts

In my opinion, Bitcoin remains bullish for now. However, expect potential market manipulation over the weekend.

Wishing everyone a great day, solid profits, and a strong cup of coffee! ☕🚀
And remember—never stop believing in Bitcoin and financial independence! 💪🔥

Hi, after a good week of asking around I've seen almost nothing but positive comments about Shobi.

So thanks to this sub I came across Shobi, I went to visit their website although the design leaves something to be desired the prices are simply crazy we are 8 euros on perfumes.
I didn't want to add any extra petrol (should I have?!)

I then simply ordered 6 perfumes.
For a total of 71 euros, with shipping and FedEx Europe, I ordered on 07/03/2025 and received it on 15/03/2025. 
So it only took 8 days

I am sitting at a coffee shop.

I am taking some time to myself before the client arrives because I have a meeting in an hour.
A couple is seated directly in front of me, they are so close that I can see the wallpaper on their phone as well.

I have no doubt that they were enjoying themselves. They appeared stunning and incredibly elegant as they held hands and giggled.Anyway, there wasn’t a lot of rush at that hour and we were pretty much the only people along with a few waiters.Suddenly, the girl bangs on the table.It was so quiet that it felt like a bomb had dropped.
I didn’t look up. I wanted none of them to feel embarrassed. So I keep staring at my coffee's artwork.As the argument grew more heated, the girl began yelling.

The man has not spoken yet. He appears disgusted and angry, but he is very different from a girl.I am not sure what the argument was about, but this is what I interpret it to be.

""An intelligent person knows so much that it knows nothing, leaves you hanging upside down, mouthing knowledge as your heart falls out of your mouth - Anne"".

But,A wise man knows when to use his intelligence. He knows when to be silent.To me the guy is wise. He could have said anything and made the scene more dramatic.Instead, he thought one of us should be silent and since she is not I will be.

It’s hard to be a wise person. Intelligent anyone can be.",3,1742031246.0,nairobi,1,1.0,False

We see each other quite often, about every two weeks. Our relationship started like a fairytale, but very soon, reality set in.

I think all these things have just built up over time: whenever we try to have a deep conversation, he provokes a discussion just for the sake of it. After every meaningful talk, I feel drained.

He also views many things purely in terms of logic and logistics, rarely considering how his words might affect me.

On top of that, he is quite insecure and controlling about almost everything. He'll say things like, ""You can't drink more than one coffee per day,"" or ""Why are you ordering a second glass of wine? That's excessive,"" or even ""Why did you post this video on Instagram? It puts me off."" 

And there are many other examples like this.

Probably the worst part is that if I imagined raising a son like him, I would hate myself.
And yet, when he does his puppy voice and puppy face, I could cry. 

He has a weak heart, and that's what makes it so hard for me to break up with him. However he call himself “egocentric” and it’s truth.

1jbrdc7,https://www.reddit.com/r/FartFetishExperiences/comments/1jbrdc7/a_special_week_with_my_aunt_was_amazing/,A special week with my aunt (WAS AMAZING),"
A gust of smell floods you you wake up and notice that your aunt is still on top of you but immediately after she gets up and leaves, probably in the kitchen drinking her coffee.

Then you get out of the mattress and go to the bathroom shortly after you go out and go down to the living room but there she is drinking her first coffee of the morning and tells you:

M: oh but look who woke up!

(Then he makes fun of you a little by continuing the sentence saying) The champion of his Aunt Mary's farts!

You just smile and keep going down the stairs to get down to the kitchen to make your breakfast with chocolate milk and cookies.

Then Mary goes back to the kitchen to put her glass in the sink and then wash it, she approaches you and pulls down her underwear then takes your glass with chocolate milk and brings it close to her ass and farts terribly then gives you back your glass and tells you

M: drink it all and then when you're done having breakfast smell the glass well and then wash it! I recommend!

T: ok....

You taste some of that milk modified by your aunt and it was terrible then you finally finish that special milk and wash it.

You're going to the guest room but your aunt stops you right away telling you to get ready because she didn't feel like cooking so you would have gone out to eat

Then you go to your room and get ready after about half an hour you come back down and see your aunt dressed in a gray sweater, comfortable shoes and super tight leggings

M: come on let's go in the car

T: OK

Go to the car Mary with the car keys opens it and goes up to the driver's seat then you get on the passenger seat, as soon as you have closed the car door Mary blocks them and makes a 30 second fart super smelly and persistent in the car then starts starting.

M: Thomas I was thinking of going to some fast food, what do you say

T: it's fine with me as long as I eat.

M: ok

Then you continue the journey and your aunt makes other terribly mature and persistent farts then after an hour of smelling only her farts you arrived at TacoBell (Mary's favorite place), then you get out of the car and set off to get inside the fast food.

You approach the board to order

You get a salad and a taco with meat and spicy sauce instead Mary took three burritos all with meat and extra cheese and extra spicy

Look for a place and find one in the lower left corner (and you also had the place on that kind of sofas).

When you sat down Mary beckoned you to go under the table for a moment,

When you lowered yourself using the excuse that you had to tie your shoes Mary took you and brought your head closer to her ass and farted in your face then she told you in a low voice to smell it all that the others must not know that she farted.

Shortly after you get up and sit in your seat,

After about ten minutes your dishes arrive and you start eating after an hour and a half Mary had finished her meal instead you had finished it not even after twenty minutes

Then you clear everything out and go throw away what you had to throw away and Mary tells you to follow her so you do it,

Go into the bathroom then close the door behind you, then Mary pulls down her leggings and underwear and tells you to stick your head inside that she has one that she can't hold back

You get down and put your face there in his rotten ass.

Then you hear a bubble coming from her belly and she stiffens then suddenly a loud and rumbled noise comes out of her asshole and immediately after a strong smell so mature and rotten hits you

M: ahhhh it just took, SMELL IT ALL! That this stinks so much.

When you're done sniffing you get up and leave the bathroom then get into the car and Mary grabs your head and brings it close to her ass and then makes another powerful and rotten fart and then pushes your head deeper and then rubs it on the bottom of her ass and then lets you go.

Then start the car and start going to a park to take a walk to get rid of some lunch after half an hour you arrive at the park, get out of the car and go to the park for the walk.

After about ten minutes your aunt stops and leans slightly forward and tells you to get down immediately and smell then shortly after a super loud, long and smelly fart

M: ahhhh I got rid of it, I needed it, you my little fart slave have you smelled?

T: yes yes and it didn't smell good at all

M: hahahaha!

After half an hour you sit on a bench for a moment and Mary sits with her legs open and tells you to put your face between her legs that she has to fart, you run and put your face between her legs and you start to smell and shortly after a wet fart, long, noisy, bubbly and that smells like a rotten egg.

Then go back to the car and go home, as soon as you get home you go to your room and train listening to music with headphones.

Since you're training by listening to music with headphones at almost maximum volume you don't realize that Mary has entered your personal bathroom and lost your toothbrush (the one you use to brush your teeth) and comes out right away.

Then Mary goes to her bathroom and pulls down her pants and mutants and starts using your electric toothbrush to clean her asshole and also makes some farts some wet and smelly some silent and lethal and others simply mature and super smelly Bbbllrrrrr,Pfttttt,Brrrrrtb

Then go back to your room and put your toothbrush back in its place shortly after he calls you at dinner and you start eating after one then you're done Mary goes to wash the dishes and you go to your room to brush your teeth and you realize that your toothbrush is not very well put it's all dirty and smelly, the only thing that stinks like that in that house is just Mary's ass, so run to her for information.

T:Mary why is my toothbrush in this condition?

M: well.... I needed something with very soft bristles to clean my asshole and the only thing that had those characteristics was your toothbrush so....

T: so what??! No you can't use my stuff, do you understand?!!

M: How dare you, little and insignificant, my fart filter, talk to me like this and with this high tone? Huh?

Mary takes you by the hand and takes you to the living room she puts your head on the couch and you gets her body on the floor then she pulls down her pants and underwear and stands up with her ass in front of your face then she suddenly sits on it.

M: NOW SMELL EVERYTHING! Small and insignificant filter, and from now on you will call me ""Mistress Mary"" clear ?.

After he told you these words he released a series of straight farts straight into your mouth.

M: it's time to clean my ass with that tongue!

Then he started farting again and in the end you gave in

I'm not mad at him- I'm sure he was being nice and im ngl my thighs are the fattest part of me so like he's not wrong but it just pmo because a few months ago he always used to compliment my waist

It just feels like I can never reach my dream body and be healthy at the same time. When I was at my closest to dream body I was vaping 24/7, chugging coffee and OMADing junk food and genuinely felt like dog shit all the time, but I was snatched and actually enjoyed wearing revealing clothes.

And now that I've been trying to quit vaping and eat healthier because I hate having this 24/7 brain fog, it's SO hard to not eat everything in sight. And it feels like i've been trying so hard these past few weeks to maintain my weight only for my thighs to look 'thick'. I'm honestly laughing at how pathetic this all is.

[800€],"Hi, so my machine is an ECM Classika, grinder 1ZPresso J-Ultra. I think I am consistent with my puck preparation at least I hope I am (use various distributors and leveling tampers.

Now the thing is I sometimes have problems dialing the grinder to get the right shot - for example setting 1.1.3 leads to a 20s espresso and 1.1.4 leads to a 35s shot. So I use like 10 turns with 1.1.3 and 10 turns with 1.1.4 setting... after which I get what I want.

Is this normal? I thought the J-Ultra is good enough. Now I am looking at a Kinu M47 grinder that is stepless and probably would solve this issue.

I would like to stay with handgrider due to the counter space - cannot afford to have a big coffee machine and a big grinder. I do not care much about the price unless its some crazy manual device I saw once for 1500EUR :-)

1jbr5eg,https://i.redd.it/03amvp7zktoe1.jpeg,Joined the team. Very pleasantly surprised by the first results!,"First post here. So I’ll start with a little bit about my coffee journey.

Got my first ‘espresso’ machine after university somewhere mid 2000s. A Philips Saeco fully automatic. Served me well for years, never amazing, but pretty reliable nonetheless. Then my journey really started in 2013, when I started doing some projects with Coffee cooperatives and smallholders in Kenya and Uganda, working on climate projects. It was there that the love, dedication and character that is put into our dear berries and beans came to light. I knew nothing about specialty coffee, but discovered step by step, roasting my own green beans (very badly I might add, turns out roasting ain’t easy) at the local coops to test the beans. Started bringing some bags home after the projects. Awesome times. 

Then upgraded to a Quickmill 3035 that I was given as a housewarming gift by a buddy. Loved it. Integrated grinder was good, and made some decent espressos. Steaming was crap, so bought a stand alone milk frother. 

Loved playing around with different beans and roasts, but after almost 10 years really reached the limit of what the machine could give me. Quite inconsistent, and grinder neared its due date. 

So here we are, La Marzocco Micra and Atom W65. And seriously: wow. From the second shot I’ve been amazed by the step-up in taste and consistency that I can pull with this combo. So much better. The GBW is fantastic, fast too. And the milk is silky smooth in no time with the micra. Couldn’t be happier with the choice.

1jbr44t,https://www.reddit.com/r/ScaryCampfireStories/comments/1jbr44t/if_you_think_you_saw_something_no_you_didnt/,"If You Think You Saw Something, No You Didn't","That’s the first rule they teach you in these woods, especially as a forest ranger. It’s not some quirky saying, it’s the rule. You learn fast that the things you think you see are better left buried deep in the back of your mind. Because when you start asking questions about those things, when you start telling people about them, bad things happen. Real bad.

I’ve been a ranger for almost five years now, and I'd like to say that I have a handle on things. The forest is peaceful, a place to lose yourself, to think. Sure, there’s the occasional weird noise in the distance, the rustling of leaves in the dead of night when there's no wind, the flicker of movement out of the corner of your eye. But that’s just nature, right?

Well, two weeks into my job, I found out firsthand why we have that rule.

I was doing my regular rounds, checking the perimeter, making sure the trail markers were still intact, and that the cabins were locked up tight. The usual stuff. There’s a trail about five miles into the woods that people like to hike, a perfect place for a little solitude and quite picturesque. It’s calm out there, quiet. You don’t expect anything to happen in a place like that.

But that day, something felt off. The trees felt taller, the air heavier. It was a late afternoon, and while the sun should’ve been setting soon, it felt like it was setting faster than usual. I shook it off, focused on the job. As I was picking up an empty bag of chips from the trail the wind picked up, making the trees sway and creak. But then... something caught my eye. Just off the path, I saw movement. A figure. It wasn’t a person, but it also didn't look like any animal I've seen. A silhouette, shifting behind the trees, far enough that I couldn’t make out details but close enough that I knew it was there. 

My heart skipped a beat, but I forced myself to think it was just some lost hiker, maybe an animal moving in the underbrush. I called out, but the forest swallowed my voice, the wind carrying it away. I stepped off the path and approached the area where I thought I’d seen it, but when I reached the spot, there was nothing. Just woods, silent and empty. I searched for a few seconds but found no footprints, no signs of anyone or anything being there just a few moments ago.

I started walking back toward the trail, and then I heard it. Footsteps behind me, light, as if someone was following just a few paces behind. My pulse quickened. I turned to see who, or what, it was. Nothing. I’m not an idiot. I knew better than to ignore it, so I quickened my pace. I tried to convince myself it was the wind, a trick of the mind, but the footsteps didn’t stop. They stayed right there, shadowing mine, perfectly in sync. And then it stopped. The sudden silence, minus the crunch of my boots on the trail, made the whole situation even more terrifying.

I paused for a moment, too scared of what may happen if I turned around now. So many choices ran through my head until I decided on one. Well, I wouldn't say I decided, more like my body chose for me. A surge of adrenaline pushed me to start speed walking back to the ranger station; something in me screaming that if I started running, I'd be dead. My heart pounded as if I was in a marathon, with each stride goosebumps formed. The crisp wind moving my hair to my face and carried the scent of vanilla through the air. The smell reminding me that any animal could find where I am, especially the thing following.

I reached the station and locked the door. After a few minutes of nothing, I sat behind the desk, chuckling at myself for getting all worked up, and for believing the other rangers' stories. A couple of them even went as far as to claim they saw stuff. At first, I thought they were just trying to mess with the new guy and get him all scared before the first watch. In that moment of giggling at their stories, I realized one of them is lining up exactly like what happened outside. The following footsteps, the feeling of being stared down, the shadow. Even the time of year is exactly when they said it happened. Trying to clear my mind from that, I decided to examine the trail cam footage on the old monitor. It was the most peaceful part of the job, just stare at the footage and take notes of the animals. A bit too peaceful given the fact I fell asleep in front of the screen for a little.

A loud noise jolted me out of my sleep, causing me to fall out of the chair. I picked myself off the floor and walked over to the window to investigate. Flipping on the floodlights outside the cabin, a large branch lying just in front of the porch. At first, I brushed it off, it's a forest and branches break all the time, only to immediately remember the fact the station is in the middle of a small clearing. The only way a branch that size would end up here is during a hurricane, and it most certainly was not raining. A multitude of reasons raced through my head, anything that could rationally explain how this hunk of wood got there. I walked away from the window over to the coffee bar, landing on the reason being a giant gust of wind flinging the branch to its spot. Taking a sip of my coffee and quietly humming to myself, I situate myself back into the semi-comfortable computer chair. A few more reports later and I'm back to watching the cameras and naming new faces. A sow, Moon, gave birth earlier in the year and the rangers fell in love with the two cubs due to their fur making it look like Light has eyebrows and Shine has a little mustache. So, one of my duties tonight is to try and spot them and update their information. 

After 3 hours I almost gave up hope, but then I saw movement around the cave Moon had chosen as her home for four years in a row. But it wasn't her. It looked almost like a deer, only the deer was trying to act human. Standing on its two hind legs and with a hunched back, it walked around the flattened area. Its eyes glowing bring in the night vision lens every time it looks in the direction of the camera. Then it paused. Sniffed in the air and looked straight at the camera. I jumped back, shocked at the accurate eye contact made through the screen. I readjusted my chair and continued to watch whatever this thing was, writing down every detail I could get while it was still visible.  The creature started walking towards the tree that the camera was perched on, its steps slow and deliberate. Once it reached the trunk the thing raised its front hooves to the bark and started shoving. Each push causes the tree, and therefore the camera, to shake immensely.

I stood up and pushed the chair back, the fear truly setting in. Quickly grabbing the walkie on my belt, I call into the closest station near me. Surely someone else is seeing this. The only problem was all the channels I tried were off, or at least that's what I assumed. At the time it didn't make sense. When the 5th station was also static I gave up that plan. I looked back at the screen and see the creature's shoving had only gotten more aggressive. By the looks of it the poplar was rocking back and forth at this point. Then just in the distance the loud sounds of groaning, cracking, and popping cut through the air. Moments later a loud crash followed and the camera was no longer in signal. With no other plan in mind, I scribble the events unfolding into the notebook. Semi-worried no one would believe me, semi-worried this will be the pages that the police would find for evidence.

The chaos didn't stop there. Not even ten minutes later another trail cam, the one filming the trail I checked earlier, showed movement. This activity was different though. The dark shape moving quickly, too quickly, back and forth in front of the camera. As if it was playing with it. I continued my notes until I glanced up and saw it staring right at me again. It's face closer than before. Close enough that I could truly see what creature was out there. It wasn't a deer, not completely anyway. It's head was shaped like a German shepherd's and eyes sat too close at the front of its face, once again glowing in the night vision. The sight of this thing making me scream. I slap my hands over my mouth and stare at the computer screen. The creature was now looking in the direction of the cabin. 

My eyes clench shut as a few tears run down my face. The fear taking complete hold of me. Quiet sobs left my mouth as I checked the camera once again.

It's gone.

You'd expect my reaction to be relief. It was not. To the depth of my core I knew it wasn't really gone. All I could think was, 

""It's coming here. It's coming for me.""

I started rummaging through the drawers of the desk, wincing at every squeak of the steel as they open. In the left bottom drawer I found an spiral notebook with no cover page, the first thing written talking about specific animals to avoid due to temperament, I almost tossed it aside but the loose cover page at the bottom of the drawer caught my eye.

'In Case of ALL Emergencies'

At this point anything could help, plus this should count as one of the emergencies...right? Thank God for whoever was looking out for me because the 2nd page in the notebook I learned there is a specific flare gun behind the antique picture of the forrest. I run over to the wall and take down the picture, setting it on the mantel of the fireplace. And just like the notebook said, a small recessed shelf hidden behind the picture held a red flare gun with three rounds sitting next to it. Realizing I neglected to read what to do with the flare, I hurry over to the book again and see at the bottom in red,

""In the case of Unique Emergencies: fire three shots into the sky.""

The sound of leaves crunching loudly catches my attention and breath. I stand there, paralyzed in terror, unsure of what to do. I can't go outside. I can't fire it in here. If I open a window to fire it will definitely get to me before I could shoot the second let alone the third. The lack of options getting to my head, I began to pace back and forth. Then the steps outside stilled, replacing the sound with jagged breathing. Through the monitor I can see the creature was standing in the middle of the small gravel parking lot, staring at the station with its head tilting ever so slightly. 

I run into the back office, flare gun and cartridges in hand, and lock the doorknob and the two deadbolt locks. I always thought these were for bear attacks. But it seems situations like these have happened before. Looking around the tattered office, I hoped to find anything that could help me. I noticed that the light hadn't been turned on and look up to see a skylight with a small black handle. I grab the step ladder and reach for the handle to see which way it opens. Twisting it slowly, I gently push up and it doesn't budge. The bookcase in the office was at the perfect height and spot to sit with your foot on the step stool for balance, so I did just that. I pushed a little harder but it still didn't budge, on a whim a tried pulling it open and it worked! 

Pulling the cartridges out of my pocket, I open the window just enough to aim the flares at the sky. I load the first one and aim it at the moon.

One down.

With the other two in my hand I quickly reload another cartridge and squeeze the trigger.

Two. One more to go.

The sound of a loud stomp from the roof almost caused me to drop the last round. I quickly caught it a shoved the round into the flare gun, the sound of heavy footsteps nearing me raising my adrenaline and causing me to shake. I aim at the moon again and pull. 

Last one,  help is coming.

I slam the window shut and twist the handle to lock just as the creature jumped into view. It stared at me through the glass, it's eyes wide enough to see the whites. The thing open it's mouth into to what I can only assume was a smile, revealing unnaturally sharp teeth, opened its mouth and let out a scream I would describe as a shrieking whistle. I cower and end up falling off the bookshelf, my landing cushioned by the scattered reports and other papers. Groaning, pull myself into the fetal position and wait for one of two things.

1. Help comes and somehow rescues me
2. This thing makes me it's next meal

The sound of hooves slamming on the glass had me leaning toward the latter being more realistic. I rock myself,  each slam of its hooves making me wince. It didn't take long for the sound of the glass starting to crack to fill the air. I hold my breath, unprepared for what horror lay in store.

Then I heard it. The sound of multiple vehicles from all around the cabin swiftly pulling up and the stomping stopped. Sounds of car doors slamming and three gun shots rang in the air. I looked up at the skylight and the creature was gone. The rangers from the other station banged on the front doors, it took me a minute to compose myself then I let the in. Immediately they asked me what happened, I told them everything that happened as best I could and showed them my notebook for my details. I asked what that thing was and they said it's best if I don't ask things I don't want to know. 

""Next time, ignore it."" A ranger chuckled out and playfully threw his arms on my shoulders, ""remember the golden rule, if you think you see something,  no you don't. ""

Anyway, aside from rumination, emotional dysegualtion, constant burn out, I'm starting to wonder about my day to day physical sensations.

Namely, constant brain fog and a low level numb/pain across my forehead and around my eyes. I drink coffee, which clears this feeling very well, and I smoked years ago, which instantly resolved this head aensaiton like  a genuine flood of tingly relief.

A friend of mine M21 ended up working in the same branch of our company. This of course led us to spend more time together before being called work husband and wife and eventually he had caught feelings for me. I do want to say that I felt a little cautious about dating again but I thought what the heck, we were practically making love with each other eyes closed.

As we began talking there was a lot of opening up, he confessed to me that in the past he’d be an alcoholic and I asked how long he’d been sober, he said 2 years. That’s great, right? Surely a mark of success he’d wanna keep? Well apparently not.

Long story short, he wanted to ask me to be his girlfriend by week 2, meet his parents month 1, asking for my passwords to all my social media platforms and my Apple ID information as well by month 2 of us talking, and telling me he was going to marry me by month 3. Don’t let me forget he had me listed as an emergency contact.

He was moving at a pace I could not keep up with, a pace i didn’t even bother trying to. We argued a lot because of this. I set up boundaries and he refused to accept it. I know, it was bad. I so badly wanted it to work because if it didn’t I could lose a friend, disrupt our office life, and also ruin his 2 years sober judging by how obsessive he was. I felt an immense pressure that I was literally creating in my own head to stay, which he then took advantage of. Every argument he’d post alcohol on his story or mention partying or doing acid somewhere on his social media, and I would beg him not to ruin his sobriety. 

My dad was an addict and I really did not want to be this man’s relapse. So yes, I begged him to get his shit together. And he said he would, but only if I took him back. So time and time again I would take him back and time and time again I’d feel miserable. Until I vented to a friend about it and eventually realized I was basically becoming his mother lol. So I told him I needed some time apart to think (which he surprisingly took well)

A week of silence goes by and he stops showing up to work. I had texted asking where he was and he said he dislocated his shoulder in an accident, and I freaked out. I asked which hospital he was at and he denied to tell me. I asked to see his dislocated shoulder and he showed me images from a surgery. I figure he wasn’t faking it because he’d dislocated it about 3 years prior, so it’s plausible to get the same injury twice I guessed. 

But then less than a week later he’s back at work. No cast in sight, just an arm sling. Odd but not appalling. He spent that day mostly trying to talk to me in meetings and even tried following me to my regular coffee shop for lunch. It was irritating, I almost went to HR but again, broken shoulder, broken heart, did I really want to break his ego next? 

So I sat with it and just ignored it.

But a few days later he’s gone again, this time his legs broken. I ask for pictures, none. What hospital? He wouldn’t share. All I could do was wish him the best but I felt frustrated with how little I knew. 

He comes back, does the puppy eyes and stalking and again, is gone in a few days.

This time the head of our department is asking and prodding me about him. And all I can say is “bad accident, idk what hospital, idk when he’ll be back, sorry”

He returns to work with what he claims was a concussion and broken ribs and when our department head asked for paperwork to prove his hospitalization he looked like he was gonna shit himself. 

He was in accident after accident and never told me what hospital he was in and continued this cycle until eventually I stopped playing along. And I think this is when he really lost his mind.

You guys, this man lied to me about bone cancer. He sent me a picture of his leg (which was supposed to be broken) and said “can you see the tumor” and yall, I’ve never seen a knee so healthy in my life. 

He said he had tumors in his leg, said he’d had an aching bump on his knee and got it checked and it came back as cancer. The photo was a normal knee cap, no lump no nothing. Not even a bruise.

Here’s where I may be the AH

I sent him a series of sarcastic messages, blocked him, called him from a friends number, and prank called that I’d been in an accident and had listed him as my emergency contact. 

At first I thought it was funny but then I felt those thoughts in my head, what if this was real? What if he had cancer and I did all this out of spite? What if this and that? And I wonder if I really should have taken it so far. 

On top of that, he hasn’t been back in two weeks so I’m starting to feel insane here. My friends have told me i should not have taken it so far and should have left it be at the block button. They say I never know what’s going on in his life and should have been a more supportive friend.

So, am I the asshole here?",6,1742028129.0,AITAH,19,1.0,False

First week was brutal (headaches, brain fog, tired), but after that my focus and energy became more stable. Productivity improved, sleep got way better, and I feel less anxious. Don’t think I’m going back.

Like a lot of people, I’ve been pretty dependent on caffeine for years. Coffee in the morning, maybe an energy drink in the afternoon, felt like the only way to function. But I started wondering: am I actually more productive, or am I just running on fumes?

So I decided to quit caffeine for 30 days. No coffee, no tea, no energy drinks. Cold turkey. Here’s what happened:

1. Week 1: Absolute hell.
Headaches, fatigue, brain fog. Felt like I was walking through molasses. My mood tanked, and I honestly considered giving up more than once. Sleep got deeper almost immediately, but waking up was brutal.


2. Week 2: The brain fog started lifting.
The headaches were mostly gone, but my focus was still shaky. Interestingly, I started feeling calmer. My energy wasn’t high, but it felt more stable. Less jittery, less anxious. The main thing I noticed was that my stress levels plummeted, despite a more hectic schedule and increased workload with deadlines approaching.


3. Week 3: Natural focus kicked in.
My brain started working again but differently. My energy felt smoother and more consistent throughout the day. I stopped getting that afternoon crash. Sleep quality kept improving too.


4. Week 4: No desire to go back.
I felt clearer. More in control. My productivity didn’t tank like I thought it would, it actually improved. I wasn’t riding the caffeine rollercoaster anymore.



Biggest takeaway: Caffeine was masking my tiredness, not fixing it. Without it, I had to confront why I was so tired in the first place (bad sleep habits, stress, etc.). Fixing that made a bigger difference than coffee ever did. I think I'll still go back to one coffee in the morning occasionally (no more than two or three times a week), but never again to the same level as before.",16,1742027385.0,DecidingToBeBetter,3,1.0,False

1jbqf6i,https://www.reddit.com/r/satisfactory/comments/1jbqf6i/changes_id_love_to_see_to_power_transmission/,Changes I'd love to see to power transmission,"I feel like somewhere the game feels really short is power management. Switches, batteries, generation, these are all awesome these days! But I'd love to see some more thought around how power is delivered. 

**1. I'd love to see structures transmit power**  
Specifically, foundations, hypertubes, train tracks. The tracks kinda do sorta but I'd really like to be able to deliver power to a single point on connected foundations and have it power buildings from there. I hate having to wire every building up individually, or run parallel power lines along every tube path. Let me land power at a single point (scaled as per the below!) and anything physically connected will receive power. As much as I know we all love hiding cables and power outlets inside the floor....

**2. Capacity limits rather than connection limits on power poles**  
At the moment you can transmit whatever amount of power you want through any size cable, you just have limited connections. Instead of limiting connections, use the poles to limit transmission. The entire game is about scaling up logistics but the power infrastructure kind of ignores this entirely. Pick some arbitrary limit, I dunno - 1MW, 10MW, 50MW for the level 1, 2 and 3 poles, and beyond that you have to use the large towers. 

I don't like that the only meaningful reason to use the big towers is aesthetic - you can always just run a single line of Mk. 1 towers as far as you want and transmit the entire grid worth of your 200 nuclear plants...  
Change the way these work so you have to use big towers for major infrastructure, then scale back for smaller factories etc.

  
I'm not sure of the details, it's not something I've done any math around, but I would love to see a more thoughtful implementation of power transmission, considering how complex and detailed the implementation of power \*generation\* is in this wonderful game.

1jbqf4b,https://www.reddit.com/r/IMGreddit/comments/1jbqf4b/my_experience_at_ahmedabad_prometric_centre/,My experience at Ahmedabad prometric centre,"Ambience was peaceful and calm.There was also TOEFL test takers whose typing can disturb if ur someone not that tolerant better use noise cancellation headphone provided there itself.

It had breakfast stalls few yards away but if you are someone having reporting time early in morning ( mine was 7.30 am but entered the centre 15-20 min before it )they are not going to cater you breakfast this early .( it’s better to have your breakfast from your ambience only or pack some).
Test centre also allows food to be given in between exam but coordinating is hard.
Lockers were large enough to accomodate regular backpack and there were also facility of microwaving, coffee brewing and ofc water .
Transparent water bottle were allowed ( remove sticker pls if any :)… many of test takers had to remove there itself).
Temperature was just fine inside centre.otherwise it’s mostly hot and sunny in Ahmedabad 🌞


Dress code - any thing is acceptable but if you want to save your break time by undergoing quick check mind these:-
1. Shirts with no collar and pockets
2. T shirts and tops with not even a fold ,sleeves greater than present in a normal tee and stitched pocket .
3. Tied hair ( better in a bun for girls) with no fancy hairtie.
4. No socks
5. No accessories.
6  bottom wear ankle length with no pockets.

Even if u have something in your attire mentioned above it’s takes less 1 min to get them checked every time you go for a break.so don’t stress too much :)

And even for mild stretching and standing in a break you have to go out in waiting area after get checked along with your locker keys and passport.
(I wasn’t anticipating this ;( )

They keep your scheduling permit with them at the beginning of test and towards the end gives a printed page about its completion with test centre code on it.

And I got to know there you can give free 120 there ( wish I had known this before -.-).
All the best !!

The city had changed.

Mumbai’s skyline stretched higher, its streets pulsed with life, and yet, as Aarav stepped out of his sleek black car, he felt like he had stepped into a memory rather than a place. The bookstore café stood just as it had years ago—tucked into a quiet corner of Colaba, filled with the scent of old pages and freshly brewed coffee.

Aarav had built an empire of words—his name was stamped on bestselling novels, his media house dictated headlines, and his words had the power to shape narratives. But today, none of that mattered. Today, he wasn’t the celebrated **Aarav Malhotra**. He was just a man walking toward a past he had never truly left behind.

And there she was.

Meera sat by the window, lost in her sketchbook. Her dark hair was tied in a messy bun, strands falling loose around her face. She still had the same quiet intensity, the same way of disappearing into her own world. But there was something else—a weight in her eyes, an absence in her presence.

Aarav stood frozen at the doorway, a thousand unsaid words pressing against his throat.

She hadn’t seen him yet.

A part of him wanted to turn back, to leave before she looked up and shattered whatever illusion he had carried all these years. But another part of him—the part that had regretted letting her go—knew he couldn’t.

Not this time.

Because some stories don’t end.

They pause.

Waiting for the right moment to begin again.
