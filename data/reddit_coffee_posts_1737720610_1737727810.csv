The indian food package included two desserts (gulab jamun and mango or orange kulfi served in an orange peel half üçä). Then there was also our wedding cake (two kinds) and the hotel also provided seasonal fruits with the tea and coffee. 

Helping a friend plan her wedding now. When you attend or had your wedding (everything from more lavish to modest), did you have multiple desserts? Since she‚Äôs trying to save money I told her just having the wedding cake is fine but she‚Äôd like to know what is most common. Thanks.

I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

As its online description states, it‚Äôs hard to tip, which is excellent when you are a klutz like me, lol. It also comes with a non-skid bottom, which I benefit from for the same reason: my extra helping of klutz genes. ü§£

I originally got one for a dear friend, as a Christmas gift. He has a movement disorder which results in a lot of body movements and, as his condition progresses, a lot of spills. I spotted this mug while looking at Stanleys on their Amazon page, and immediately thought of my friend. This is definitely something that will NOT tip over if there‚Äôs a movement misfire while reaching for the mug! It won‚Äôt tip, it won‚Äôt slide away if it‚Äôs bumped while he‚Äôs reaching for it, and if it falls, it won‚Äôt break easily.

The one caveat: while drinking, the closer you get to emptying the mug, the farther back you have to tilt your head. My friend uses straws to drink, so this won‚Äôt be a problem for him. I already have several silicone reusable straws, and I just carry one when I take the mug with me.

1i8w1lv,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleAndFaith/comments/1i8w1lv/faith_as_a_compass_making_tough_decisions/,Faith as a Compass: Making Tough Decisions,"Alright, let‚Äôs dive into this concept of prayer and scripture guiding decision-making in business‚Äîbecause, let‚Äôs be honest, if you think navigating the world of business is easy, you haven‚Äôt tried figuring out if you should expand your team or just hire a really competent goldfish to hold the fort.

Picture this: You've got decisions looming over you like a storm cloud on a sunny day. You‚Äôve got numbers dancing in your head and projections that look more confusing than a squirrel running in circles. And then it hits you‚Äîwhat if I took a moment to breathe and chat with the Big Guy upstairs? Prayer, in all its simple beauty, opens the door to clarity we often overlook in our hustle and bustle.

It‚Äôs amazing how a few moments of prayer can settle those racing thoughts. It‚Äôs like hitting the reset button on your mental computer. You might find yourself pondering the story of Solomon asking for wisdom‚Äîa dude who could have asked for anything and chose the ability to make smart choices instead (not a yacht or a giant cupcake factory). Now that‚Äôs a decision-making hack I can get behind. We often want the quick fix, but sometimes the best course of action is rooted in patience and seeking divine guidance. 

Then there‚Äôs the scripture‚Äîthe real treasure map in all this chaotic decision-making. You know, when you stumble across verses like Proverbs 16:3‚Äî‚ÄúCommit to the Lord whatever you do, and he will establish your plans.‚Äù That‚Äôs not just nice fluff; it‚Äôs a full-on invitation to recognize that we‚Äôre not in this alone. Each verse is like a friendly nudge, reminding us that our businesses are not merely driven by profit margins but also by purpose. 

One of the most beautiful things about integrating faith into your business decisions is that it fosters a sense of community. When you bring prayer into the mix, it invites others‚Äîteam members, mentors, even clients‚Äîto join you in seeking greater wisdom. It transforms a simple board meeting into a collective moment of reflection, where everyone feels part of something larger. You‚Äôre not just a lone wolf trying to navigate the corporate jungle; suddenly, you‚Äôve got a support network around you. 

And let‚Äôs be real, decisions made in isolation can lead to outcomes that feel about as stable as a Jenga tower on a wobbly table. When you involve scripture and prayer, those decisions become more than transactional‚Äîthey become transformational. You're attuning your heart to values that reflect a greater good, striving for ethics that align with your beliefs.

In the end, it‚Äôs about saying ""yes"" to a way of doing business that honors not just the bottom line but also the journey itself. Decision-making doesn‚Äôt have to feel like high-stakes gambling; it can be a guided experience where each choice propels you toward not just success, but also fulfillment in your mission. So, grab that coffee, drop a little prayer, and let the wisdom flow‚Äîthere‚Äôs a lot more than spreadsheets and profit margins when you step back and let faith in on the conversation.",1,1737727306.0,HustleAndFaith,0,1.0,False

Hey fellow AI enthusiasts! ü§ñ‚ú® Today, I want to take you on a thrilling ride into the future of transportation, where Artificial Intelligence is not just a passenger but the driver! Whether you're a tech newbie or a seasoned AI expert, buckle up as we explore autonomous vehicles and the exciting horizons beyond them.

---

### üöó Autonomous Vehicles: Not Just Science Fiction Anymore!

Remember the days when self-driving cars were something out of a sci-fi movie? Fast forward to 2023, and they're becoming a reality! Companies like Tesla, Waymo, and Uber are steering us into a world where cars think and react on their own.

**How Do They Work?**  
Autonomous vehicles rely on a symphony of AI technologies: computer vision to decipher the environment, machine learning to make split-second decisions, and sensors to stay aware of everything around them. Imagine combining all this with GPS navigation ‚Äì you get a car that knows the road nearly as well as a seasoned driver!

**Why Should We Care?**  
The impact of autonomous vehicles is massive! From reducing traffic accidents to giving us more time to enjoy our morning coffee, the perks are plenty. It's not just about convenience; it's about transforming our urban landscapes and economic systems.

### üöÜ AI Beyond Cars: A Revolution on Rails and in the Skies

But wait, there's more! AI's magic isn't limited to the road. Picture this: AI-operated trains reducing human error and increasing efficiency, or AI in aviation revolutionizing air traffic control and flight operations.

**On the Rails:**  
AI systems help trains operate more efficiently and safely by predicting faults before they happen and optimizing schedules. It's like having a living, breathing assistant in the conductor's cabin.

**In the Air:**  
AI dramatically enhances aircraft safety by providing predictive analytics for maintenance and transforming air traffic systems, making our skies safer and less congested.

It has a safeguard where the machine shuts off if the level goes too low (using a simple magnetic floater), but since don't always check the water level before pulling a shot, it happens that it shuts off in the middle of a shot, wasting coffee and annoying me.

I've bought a simple water leak sensor that I've put inside the tank, allowing me to warn me in advance through my smart home. However, since this sensor is submerged most of the time, I was wondering about the safety of this. It's a white plastic extension with two metal conductive pins.

1i8vtim,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i8vtim/be_very_wary_of_certain_massage_parlors/,Be Very Wary of Certain Massage Parlors....,"I‚Äôve never been one to indulge in self-care. Life as a young professional in a bustling city left little room for such luxuries. But after months of grueling hours at work, my body ached for relief, and my mind desperately needed a break from the chaos.

So, when I heard about Elysium Touch, the new massage parlor that had opened just down the street, I was intrigued enough to give it a try.

As I stepped inside, the receptionist greeted me with a warm smile, and a delicate aroma of essential oils wafted through the air.¬†

Instantly, it felt as if I had entered another world‚Äîone where stress simply melted away.

Minutes later, I was introduced to my masseuse, Nina. She was strikingly beautiful, tall, with an athletic build that suggested she took great care of herself. .

Her long, dark hair fell in soft waves down her back, glistening under the parlor‚Äôs gentle lights, accentuating her high cheekbones and delicate jawline.

As she led me to the massage room, her captivating green eyes sparkled with warmth and kindness, instantly putting me at ease.¬†

The deep tissue massage I‚Äôd chosen unfolded like a carefully choreographed symphony.

Every movement of her hands was deliberate, soothing, expertly targeting the knots that had lodged themselves deep in my muscles. The oils she used filled the room, their aroma wrapping around me like a warm embrace, drawing me deeper into relaxation.

The rhythmic, melodic music in the background was almost hypnotic. Time seemed to disappear as my worries dissolved, replaced by a serenity I hadn‚Äôt felt in years.

Soon, I became a regular at *Elysium Touch*, visiting at least once a week. Each session felt like a mini escape from reality. I even took advantage of their enticing discount packages, and on my last visit, I received nearly 75% off‚Äîa deal that made no business sense to me, but who was I to complain?

However, when I visited Elysium for the fourth time, I had no idea what awaited me that night.¬†

The management called my number, offering a complimentary massage as a reward for my loyalty, saying I only needed to pay for refreshments. In hindsight, that should have set off alarm bells in my head, but all I could think about was Nina.  
  


Over the weeks, I had begun to feel an unexpected connection with her.¬†

Nina listened, laughed at my terrible jokes, and even shared snippets of her own life. Nina‚Äôs also the curious sort; she likes to learn more about her clients, and I for one am always happy to share. I told her about where I worked, what I did for a living, and that I had no family to speak of and lived alone, not far from here.¬†

Sometimes, I even seriously considered asking her out on a date so that I could get to know her better.¬†

But that night, something was off. Really off.¬†

As the massage began, everything felt familiar at first‚Äîher touch, the soothing oils, the gentle music. But this time, the oils had a stronger scent, almost overwhelming. A strange fuzziness started to creep over me.¬†

I tried to stay awake, to focus, but the effort felt ultimately futile. My grip on consciousness was slipping, and before I knew it, I was being pulled into a deep, inescapable sleep.

When I finally woke up, bright white lights hurt my eyes, and a coldness seeped into my bones. Panic clawed at my throat as I tried to move.

I realized quickly that I was strapped to a cold, metal operating table.¬†

My heart raced, pounding against my chest like a caged animal. The last thing I remembered was Nina‚Äôs touch, her smile.¬†

Where was she now?

And who were all these people?

I looked around, my pulse quickening as masked figures surrounded me, their faces obscured by surgical masks. A deep, unsettling chill settled in my gut as I tried to comprehend the situation.

¬†‚ÄúAh, you‚Äôre awake,‚Äù a voice said, smooth and eerily calm.

¬†It belonged to a man dressed in scrubs‚Äîhis eyes gleamed with a sadistic glint. ‚ÄúWelcome to my operating table. My name is Dr. Harrow, and I‚Äôll be your surgeon today.‚Äù¬†

My mind raced. ‚ÄúWhat... what‚Äôs happening? Let me go!‚Äù I screamed, but my voice sounded weak and distant.

Dr. Harrow picked up a scalpel, holding it delicately between his fingers, letting it glint menacingly under the bright lights.¬†

‚ÄúThis little tool will help us acquire what we need from you, Alex. Thanks to your sacrifice, you'll save a lot of lives and also help us make a lot of money,‚Äù he said, as those gathered around him‚Äîalso dressed in scrubs‚Äînodded in unison, their eyes fixed on me.

‚ÄúDo you want to know what we‚Äôre going to take from you Alex?‚Äù he continued, smiling as he slowly traced the blade over my body‚Äîlingering over my kidneys, lungs, heart, throat, and finally resting just above my eyes.

At that moment, the horrifying realization hit me‚ÄîI had just fallen victim to an organ trafficking ring.¬†

I recoiled in terror, frantically trying to free myself, but my hands and feet were bound tightly to the table.

‚ÄúNow, let‚Äôs get you ready, shall we?‚Äù Dr. Harrow spoke, signaling to one of his assistants, who approached me with a syringe in his hand.¬†

I recognized it was anesthesia. They were going to put me to sleep again.

¬†Fear clawed at my insides as I thought of being trapped in this filthy, makeshift underground clinic.

¬†The reality of what was happening‚Äîthat my body was about to be sliced apart for its organs‚Äîhit me like a sledgehammer.¬†

My heart pounded in my chest, the weight of my own impending death pressing down on me.

Just as the needle pricked my skin, I heard a loud bang from outside the room.

¬†The doors of the operating room suddenly flew open, and a group of police officers stormed in.

‚ÄúPolice! Hands in the air!‚Äù they shouted, guns drawn.¬†

Panic swept through the room. Dr. Harrow reacted quickly, yanking my head back and pressing the scalpel to my throat. ‚ÄúStay back, or I‚Äôll slit his throat!‚Äù he yelled, his voice cracking, his eyes wild.

I could barely breathe. The cold edge of the scalpel dug into my neck, and every muscle in my body froze.¬†

Then, in a flash, a single gunshot rang out. Harrow‚Äôs body jerked violently, his head snapping back as blood sprayed across my face. He crumpled on top of me, his dead weight pressing me into the table.

I screamed, choking on panic as gunfire erupted in all directions between the police and the remaining goons.¬†

The operating table jolted, tipping over, and I crashed to the floor. The impact knocked the wind out of me, and before I could process what was happening, everything went dark.

When I opened my eyes again, I was in a hospital room, a warm blanket draped over me. Officer Reed sat beside my bed, relief softening the lines on his face.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre safe now, Alex,‚Äù he said, his voice steady. ‚ÄúWe got there just in time. They were about to operate on you, steal your organs.‚Äù

I blinked, trying to process the whirlwind of events. ‚ÄúThe massage parlor‚Ä¶ Nina‚Ä¶ was she part of this?‚Äù

Reed shook his head. ‚ÄúNo, Nina‚Äôs an undercover agent. We‚Äôve been investigating Elysium Touch for weeks. They specifically target individuals who live alone and have no close living relatives. It‚Äôs a massive organ-smuggling ring. They research their clients, choosing those who fit their profile. That‚Äôs how they‚Äôve stayed under the radar for so long. You were almost their next victim.‚Äù

His words sank in slowly. ‚ÄúSo Nina‚Ä¶ she ‚Ä¶saved me?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù he confirmed. ‚ÄúHer undercover work brought us to you just in time.‚Äù

The weight of betrayal still settled heavily on my chest even as I learned the truth about Nina.

¬†‚ÄúI thought she cared‚Ä¶ I thought she was different.‚Äù I said finally.¬†

Reed‚Äôs expression suddenly¬† softened as he let out a deep sigh. ‚ÄúNina did what she had to in order to maintain her cover. You‚Äôre lucky to be alive, Alex. These are dangerous people, constantly moving to avoid detection. They‚Äôve gotten away with it for too long, but this time, we‚Äôll make sure they face justice.‚Äù

I spent a few more days in the hospital, my body slowly healing, but my mind remained trapped in that cold, sterile operating room. Nightmares plagued my sleep‚Äîvisions of Dr. Harrow looming over me, scalpel in hand.

Despite the lingering fear, I forced myself to return to some sense of normalcy, pushing through the unease that clung to me now like a second skin.¬†

I had been given a second chance, and I wanted to make it count even though it was difficult to find peace in the chaos.

Then, one evening, I saw her‚ÄîNina‚Äîwalking along the sidewalk. For a moment, I hesitated, unsure of what to say. But gratitude pushed me forward.

""Nina,"" I called out, my voice a little shaky.

She turned, her eyes meeting mine. ""Thank you, for saving my life"" I said.

She gave a small nod, her face softening just slightly.

After a beat, I blurted out, ""Would you‚Ä¶ maybe want to grab coffee sometime?""

She paused, considering, then nodded. ""Sure,"" she replied, her voice calm but sincere.

A brief, tentative smile passed between us, and for the first time, I felt a flicker of hope.¬†

Maybe this was the beginning of healing. Maybe, despite everything, I could find a way to move forward with a happy ending, no pun intended.

After completing my  bachelors degree I took a year off to figure out my masters study field. I never liked the hustle and bustle of the cities and my home is in very quiet suburbs. 

I used to wake up in the evening, have some breakfast and go to the gym, workout really hard, then visit a ""khau gully"" (street food plaza of sorts) Where my favorite dishes were loni dosa (70‚Çπ, less than a dollar), cut pav bhaji (80‚Çπ, a dollar), cold coffee (50‚Çπ, 60 cents), shawarma (90‚Çπ, a little over a dollar), chai/tea (12‚Çπ, ~15 cents) and hot coffee at one of the canteens near the gym (25‚Çπ, less than 25 cents) where I used to go just to cool off after the the gym but coffee was still good. My expenses were virtually null since I stayed with my parents. 

After that go home and study/research all night. Rinse and repeat. 

Tbh life was boring but very peaceful, used to go to nearby cities to visit friends sometimes. And go on long unplanned bike rides once in a month or so.

I live in the south so we don‚Äôt get a lot of cold but the last few weeks it‚Äôs definitely been colder with some small snow and ice storms. Totally out of the norm for us.

**Chapter IV**

**One For Sorrow**

Astral sat on the train next to the young girl, Ariane, as she munched on some of his newest candy cigarettes. He pulled out his cell phone and texted Ukiko, her response was an automated text to call if it was important. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre worried.‚Äù Ariane smiled, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all right, I‚Äôm fine. I have friends and a safe place. I mostly make sure nothing and no one stays lost.‚Äù 

Astral smiled, ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm not lost.‚Äù 

‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre lonely.‚Äù Ariane said in as simple and innocent a tone as he had ever heard. 

Astral‚Äôs heart lurched in pain, but he smirked to try and shrug it off. ‚ÄúAdults get lonely sometimes.‚Äù He dialed Ukiko, ‚ÄúI gotta talk to a friend real quick.‚Äù 

Ariane smiled and turned back to munching on the candy.

‚ÄúWhat do you want, you moon-faced assassin of joy?‚Äù Ukiko asked with a groan as she picked up. Astral knew the sound of someone deep in a bottle, and he also respected the insult.

‚ÄúI need working pants on Ms Kanade.‚Äù Astral said seriously, he almost heard her shift gears over the phone. ‚ÄúI found a kid, no family. She has powers and I don‚Äôt know how to handle that here. I just want to make sure the Church doesn‚Äôt get her.‚Äù 

Ukiko audibly wiped her nose. ‚ÄúLet me get some coffee and call you back.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThanks, and Ukiko.‚Äù Astral smirked as he felt her pause, ‚ÄúGreat sling. Keep that on file for people you really hate.‚Äù 

He heard her snort as she hung up.

‚ÄúYour friend‚Äôs lonely too.‚Äù Ariane said. ‚ÄúI can tell. The lost, the forgotten. I know them when I hear or see them.‚Äù 

Astral put his phone away. ‚ÄúHow do you know?‚Äù He wanted to make sure he wasn‚Äôt dealing with some poor psychic kid who didn‚Äôt know she was reading minds.

Ariane thought as she munched on the candy, her nose scrunched a bit. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really know, it‚Äôs like I feel it in my heart and then I remember we‚Äôre supposed to find and help each other.‚Äù 

Astral smiled, she was at least being taught the right things. ‚ÄúWho taught you that?‚Äù 

‚ÄúThe nice glowy man.‚Äù Ariane shrugged, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs all I remember before I woke up here.‚Äù 

Astral nodded, ‚Äúglowy man‚Äù wasn‚Äôt much to go on, but someone was at least a good teacher to her.  He sighed and shook his head.

‚ÄúHe asked me to help him find his voice!.‚Äù Ariane nodded and smiled as she munched on the candy. ‚ÄúBut he had a nice voice so I don‚Äôt get it...‚Äù 

‚ÄúMaybe he meant finding someone to speak for him?‚Äù Astral asked.

‚ÄúLike you?‚Äù Ariane asked, ‚ÄúYou have a nice voice too!‚Äù 

‚ÄúNah, kid, I don‚Äôt speak for people. I use my fists mostly.‚Äù Astral laughed. ‚ÄúGlad to know whoever taught you, taught you well.‚Äù Astral patted her head. ‚ÄúYou got some cool powers kid.‚Äù 

Ariane smiled and handed him his candy back, ‚ÄúThanks. I can do a few other things, but it‚Äôs mostly to protect me. I can summon ghosties out of a storm when I need someone.‚Äù 

‚ÄúGhosties?‚Äù Astral smiled, ‚ÄúLike Casper?‚Äù 

Ariane shook her head, ‚ÄúSometimes the nice older guy comes, sometimes it‚Äôs some angry yokai who want to help me. The ghost mamas are the kindest but they get angry fast.‚Äù She giggled, ‚ÄúAnd sometimes I make Teddy bigger. He's my teddy bear.‚Äù

Astral nodded and smiled, ‚ÄúWell my friend and I want to help you stay safe.‚Äù 

He got a text from Ukiko telling him where to get off. It was coming up soon, so he knew he was close to home.

Ariane smiled, ‚ÄúOthers have tried, but I always get lost in the paperwork. Or the paperwork gets lost. Or just walks away.‚Äù 

Astral frowned, that didn‚Äôt sound normal to him. He was about to speak again when a darkness crept along his spine like a boa constricting a victim. Every angelic sense told him a daemon was near, and not a weak one. He looked about and saw the car two lengths back had a flickering set of lights. Several men stood, distorted as if he was looking through foggy glass. He stood up and stepped forward, tossing his coat to his seat.

‚ÄúAre they bad men?‚Äù Ariane asked, ‚ÄúThey feel wrong.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre very bad monsters.‚Äù Astral pulled a crucifix from his pocket, it was made of solid silver and he put it on her neck. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt take this off.‚Äù 

Ariane nodded, ‚ÄúWe should go to the front.‚Äù 

Astral looked towards the forward end of the train. There were more people that way, he couldn‚Äôt risk the beasts getting to actual people. 

He smiled and nodded. ‚ÄúGet off at the next stop. If I'm not with you, call Ukiko...‚Äù He handed the girl his phone.

‚ÄúBut...‚Äù Ariane tried to argue.

‚ÄúAriane, I know you want to help. Good people always do, but my job is to make sure these things don‚Äôt hurt more people.‚Äù He looked up, they were in the next car, about halfway through. ‚ÄúGo, please.‚Äù 

Ariane nodded and grabbed his coat and rolled it up. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll keep this safe too!‚Äù She ran off.

Astral turned and focused, his wings grew out but were quickly cramped. He counted the ‚Äúmen‚Äù as they passed into the car. Three daemons wearing human skin and a daemon incarnate entered. His skin crawled in fear and revulsion, a daemon hadn‚Äôt been incarnated on Earth in over two centuries and that one took a small army to take down. What hell had he just walked into? 

‚ÄúWell. Well. Well.‚Äù The lead daemon, the incarnated one, grinned, he was dressed in a cheap denim outfit, his human form barely looked human and his voice was like oil lit on fire and tossed into a deep cavern. 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs deep boss.‚Äù One of the walkers snickered. ‚ÄúNot as deep as this shit head is in it though.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou know I think I know you.‚Äù The leader smirked.

‚ÄúGo fuck yourself.‚Äù Astral growled.

‚ÄúYeah...‚Äù The shortest possessed man snickered, ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre right, boss.‚Äù 

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs gotta be him.‚Äù The last one added. ‚ÄúThe one who sent Mammon packing.‚Äù 

‚ÄúMust have been a hell of a fight.‚Äù The leader commented, ‚ÄúCost that other halfie her life as I understand it. Hope she wasn‚Äôt special to you.‚Äù The daemon sat down a few feet away, then laid down on the seats. ‚ÄúFuck him up.‚Äù 

Astral took a breath, he knew they were provoking him. He knew they had every advantage over him. Space, numbers, power and likely even skill. But in that singular moment, it didn‚Äôt matter. All that mattered was putting their sick faces into the ground as hard as he could. 

Astral lashed out and sent the shortest daemon possessed man sailing back into the door for the car. He smashed into it and it bent outward, holding him for a short time. The car behind him reacted by screaming and moving forward.

‚ÄúFresh meat.‚Äù The tallest of the possessed moved forward, but caught a series of jabs to his ribs.

Astral was then pulled back by the other possessed man. The daemon wearing the man‚Äôs skin hissed and bit into Astral‚Äôs neck. Astral screamed and dropped himself back and forced his elbow into the possessed man‚Äôs stomach. He was let go and sprang forward, grabbed the tall daemon and threw him backwards. He collided with the shortest one and put him back into a position where he was once again stuck in the metal door.

The second daemon stood, grabbing his stomach and lurched forwards as claws exploded from the man‚Äôs hands. They were long and black covered in blood and ichor and Astral barely dodged the slash and ripped a standing pole out from its position, then he rammed it through the daemon‚Äôs chest. The creature hissed and vomited at Astral.

The acidic slime coated his mouth and chest and Astral wanted to scream, but he bit down and forced himself to charge forward. He pushed the daemon and the pole straight into the backs of the other daemons. They writhed as he then bent the pole and forced it into the floor and locked them in place. Then he began to recite a prayer, it didn‚Äôt need to be latin or anything special, just a true invocation of faith. 

‚ÄúHeaven be thy guide...‚Äù Astral started, ‚ÄúTo return to realms you are not meant to leave!‚Äù 

‚ÄúShut him up boss!‚Äù The three shouted.

‚ÄúWell you should have won!‚Äù The incarnated daemon stood up and glared, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre all lucky I need you.‚Äù He rushed forward and drove a clawed hand right into Astral‚Äôs back.

Astral knew it was coming, but he couldn‚Äôt react fast enough. He roared in pain, the daemon‚Äôs toxic influence seemed to pour into his own body and it burned worse than anything he had ever felt. He went limp as if he had lost every ounce of fight in him. The daemon threw him towards the front of the car, then ripped the pole out of his subordinates. 

‚ÄúLook at you halfie...‚Äù The leader scoffed, ‚ÄúThinking you‚Äôre hot shit because you took out the tulpa. Got your first taste of an incarnated daemon though. Bet that sucks. Well sucked, cause it ain‚Äôt lasting long.‚Äù 

Astral forced himself to stand, ‚ÄúI still have breath in my lungs.‚Äù 

‚ÄúBrave. Courageous. Halfie.‚Äù The daemon laughed, ‚ÄúI am a knight, you had no chance here.‚Äù 

Astral‚Äôs fear grew, a daemon knight had incarnated. It was the second worst case scenario. The only thing worse would be a daemon prince or lord.  

‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm bringing my boss here.‚Äù The knight grinned and a scaled tail lashed out and pierced Astral‚Äôs shoulder. 

Astral grimaced but held strong, but he barely had the strength to stand.

‚ÄúWell, you are stubborn.‚Äù The Knight headbutted Astral. 

Astral collapsed to a knee and shook his head. He hated headbutts, he just didn‚Äôt have the skull for them.  Then he noticed the fog rolling in from the door behind him. 

‚ÄúNo...‚Äù Astral forced himself to stand once again. ‚ÄúYou can kill me, but I‚Äôm the only one...‚Äù 

The knight chuckled, ‚ÄúAnd you think you can stop me. You already stopped us once, not again.‚Äù 

The tattoos across Astral‚Äôs chest began to come into view and glow brightly as he focused on standing, ignoring the daemon-knight‚Äôs taunts. 

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs got scripture on him.‚Äù The tall daemon noted as the three underlings stepped back.

‚ÄúIdiots, it‚Äôs not blessed, they‚Äôre just words.‚Äù The Knight snarled.

Astral grinned, ‚ÄúYeah, but now I‚Äôm warmed up.‚Äù He lashed out and cracked a fist charged with energy into the knight‚Äôs jaw. 

The daemon stumbled back a step and glared at Astral, Astral took a step forward and planted himself firmly. Then the door opened and fog filled the room. He felt some strength surge back to him and slowly begin to trickle in, but it wasn't enough, he could still barely stand.

Then someone pushed past him. He was tall and slender, curled locks seemed to roll down his head like inky coils.  He wore a simple top hat, of all things and sat it on the nearest seat. Astral was uncertain who the man was, but terrified for his life and tried to move forward.

The well worn grip of the man‚Äôs decorative cane smacked into Astral's chest. The half angel looked down as he realized The man was holding him back.

‚ÄúRest and watch.‚Äù The man turned his head and his eyes gleamed with satisfaction, an English accent rode the Japanese he spoke nearly fluently. ‚ÄúThe toxins should be hitting you now anyway.‚Äù

Astral felt his legs wane in strength, but he wouldn't fold again. He watched the four daemons glare at the man, but even the knight seemed to regard this stranger with caution.

‚ÄúRun along.‚Äù The man grinned. ‚ÄúThese are now under my watch.‚Äù He gestured back to Astral and Ariane.

Ariane crept in and held tight to Astral's leg. Astral forced himself to stand taller and took a defensive stance.

‚ÄúSit down.‚Äù The man said with a strange authority to his tone. Then he turned back to the daemons. ‚ÄúYou're still here?‚Äù He was clearly unimpressed with them.

The knight looked at the now wrecked door behind him and shrugged. ‚ÄúYou're in the way.‚Äù

The man held out his hand and a rosary fell and dangled. He began a chant in a language that echoed in Astral‚Äôs head, it was as if he understood the words without knowing them all. The words gave him a focus as he watched the daemons writhe against them. Astral was astonished, he was in the presence of an honest to God thaumaturgist.

The leader shrieked and rushed at the window and smashed it open with several quick headbutts. Then he leaped out, his cronies followed.

‚ÄúAlways such pests.‚Äù The man sighed as he turned around and gave a gentle smile as he picke something up. ‚ÄúMust be stalking high schoolers...‚Äù He flashed the school ID to Astral.

Astral relaxed the tiniest bit and his body failed him as he slumped forward. He felt the man catch him and set him in a seat.

‚ÄúCome on now nephilim, you‚Äôre stronger than that.‚Äù The man said gently.

Astral tried to speak but the pain was too great as he tried to reach for the ID that the man had dropped to catch him. He nodded to Ariane, but she seemed to not understand.

‚ÄúMister, we get off soon.‚Äù Ariane put her head on Astral‚Äôs leg and started to sob.

‚ÄúCome now, he'll be fine with a night's rest and treatment.‚Äù The man said as he patted the girl in the head. ‚ÄúTrust me, I'm a special doctor.‚Äù

Ariane smiled up at him and nodded, then smiled at Astral.

‚ÄúFocus on your breathing.‚Äù The thaumaturgist said, ‚ÄúHe gave you lungs for a reason.‚Äù 

Astral wanted to glare at the man, but focused. Daemon toxins were hard enough to deal with, and he had gotten a double dose. He reached his hand out to Ariane and she held it fast.

Then the signal for their stop came over the speaker. The thaumaturgist stood and helped Astral put on his coat. Astral couldn't even withdraw his wings and the man had to carefully fold them under the cloth.

‚ÄúTough as steel.‚Äù The man commented as he supported Astral's weight on the way out.

A station officer approached as they exited.

‚ÄúI'm a doctor, he's a hero and will be treated at his home.‚Äù The thaumaturgist brushed past the officer.

‚ÄúAstral?!‚Äù Ukiko's voice pierced the night as she approached. ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúDr. Mourning, thaumaturgist and daemon slayer.‚Äù The thaumaturgist nodded, ‚ÄúYoung Astral here needs some rest, if you're a friend could you show me to his home?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe needs a hospital!‚Äù Ukiko pointed to blood running down his arm.

‚ÄúBlast, the toxins are at the open wound stage.‚Äù Dr. Mourning sighed, ‚ÄúMiss, the wound cannot be healed at a hospital, even ones for heroes. He needs time and special care.‚Äù

Ukiko nodded and looked at Astral. His face was swollen from a powerful blow. She saw a red stain through his coat on his right shoulder and he had labored breathing.  Yet he held firmly to the small hand of a young girl next to him.

Ukiko smiled, ‚ÄúI'm Ms. Kanade, are you the child Astral is helping?‚Äù

‚ÄúI'm Ariane.‚Äù The girl wiped her eyes. ‚ÄúThe doctor said he should be fine, but now he's bleeding again...‚Äù 

‚ÄúHe will be.‚Äù Dr. Mourning said, ‚ÄúMs Kanade, Please take the girl, I'm going to need to carry Astral from here.‚Äù

Ukiko nodded, but looked at the man incredulously. She took Ariane's hand and watched the man shift Astral into a fireman‚Äôs carry.

‚ÄúPlease lead the way! Time is of the essence!‚Äù Dr. Mourning shouted.

Astral smiled as he felt the world shift and blacked out.

**(\o/)-(\o/)-(\o/)**

When he woke up his room was dark, but the hall light was on and he heard three distinct voices. He recognized the first as Ukiko, she wasn‚Äôt in a happy mood by the sound of things. The other was less familiar, but he recalled the thaumaturgist. Occasionally the giggles of Ariane filled the hall. 

He stood, wobbly at first and using the wall to support himself, then made his way to his front room. Ariane was watching a show on a laptop plugged in next to a bean bag chair. The kitchen light and two shadows from within told him where the other two were.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt suppose a guy can get a meal.‚Äù Astral managed to cough out. Then he started a coughing fit. 

Ariane looked over her shoulder and got up and hugged his leg.

Ukiko rushed out and the thaumaturgist followed. Ukiko tried to get Astral to sit in one of his few chairs. He shook his head until the thaumaturgist also insisted with a simple gesture. Then the man pulled out a stethoscope and began to listen to Astral‚Äôs vitals.

‚ÄúPlease return to cooking the meal, Ms Kanade. I have this in hand.‚Äù The man said flatly.

Ukiko frowned but did so.

‚ÄúA good woman, if stubborn.‚Äù The thaumaturgist said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we got to exchange names, I‚Äôm Dr. Mourning, I got yours from Ms Kanade.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, a doctor and a thaumaturgist. I‚Äôm impressed.‚Äù Astral laughed and coughed.

‚ÄúYou took a beating and a hell of a dose of powerful daemon toxins.‚Äù Dr. Mourning said, ‚ÄúFrankly, I‚Äôm impressed that you survived, let alone that you're conscious now.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou said he would make it!‚Äù Ariane smiled, ‚ÄúYou were right.‚Äù 

At first the doctor went to argue, but smiled and nodded with a look a grandparent would give when tired of arguing.

‚ÄúYou drove them off.‚Äù Astral noted, ‚ÄúEasily.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI did.‚Äù Dr. Mourning nodded, ‚ÄúYears of experience, and trust me I am older than I look.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard that thaumaturgy has that effect.‚Äù Astral nodded. ‚ÄúSo why did the church send me here if they had you?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Church?!‚Äù The doctor scoffed, as if deeply offended.  ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt see eye to eye.‚Äù 

Astral nodded, ‚ÄúFair enough.‚Äù Astral tried to stretch. 

‚ÄúAnd how does a half angel get a name like ‚ÄòAstral‚Äô?‚Äù The Doctor smirked.

‚ÄúMom was a new-ager. Dad could never say no.‚Äù Astral shrugged, ‚ÄúExcept when it saved me.‚Äù 

‚ÄúDaemons?‚Äù Mourning asked.

‚ÄúDaemonic Cult.‚Äù Astral nodded, ‚ÄúWorse in my opinion.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThey usually are.‚Äù Mourning nodded and stood up. ‚ÄúNow, you‚Äôve been out of it for two days, I want you resting for two more. Painkillers should work now, but rest is the most important part. I‚Äôll be back in two days to check on you.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù Astral nodded, ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt believe there was an incarnated knight here.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThere are worse on the streets of Tokyo and her surroundings these modern nights.‚Äù Mourning sighed, ‚ÄúPerhaps you are providence, or perhaps you will simply join the lost.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWe have each other. We‚Äôre not lost!‚Äù Ariane said, ‚ÄúYou can be a friend too!‚Äù 

The tall Englishman looked down at the girl and gave a weak smile, ‚ÄúI am mostly unwelcome wherever I find myself.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre welcome here.‚Äù Astral said, ‚ÄúAnyone willing to step in against a daemon is. Regardless of their power against them. Though I‚Äôd love to learn that trick.‚Äù 

The man looked at Astral and blinked, ‚ÄúWere you never taught to pray or to seek guidance? To use your angelic heritage?‚Äù 

‚ÄúNot really, only ever could get it to work in a fight.‚Äù Astral smirked, ‚ÄúSo they just taught me to hit things. It's how we were all taught.‚Äù 

‚ÄúOf course the bloody church forwent the most important lessons...‚Äù Mourning sighed and pressed his hand to his chin in thought while tapping his foot. ‚ÄúFine, I‚Äôll teach you. It seems someone has to if we are to expect you to survive.‚Äù 

Astral blinked, ‚ÄúReally? You can teach me that, I‚Äôm pretty dull when it comes to learning.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThen I shall hammer it in with a ruler and your knuckles.‚Äù Mourning leaned down with a sadistic grin and Astral felt like his soul had just been eclipsed by the power of the odd thaumaturgist. 

‚ÄúI punched the last teacher that did that.‚Äù Astral smirked, though he was shaken at the deepest part of his core.


‚ÄúThen when I come back, I will bring the first lesson.‚Äù Mourning grinned. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll leave my card with Miss Kanade if you need me.‚Äù He then saw his own way out.  

Ukiko peeked around the corner, ‚ÄúI set Ariane up out here. She had to go to her ‚Äòhome‚Äô to check with her friends and get her stuffed Teddy.‚Äù

Astral blinked and stood up. ‚ÄúAriane, thank you.‚Äù He smiled at the young girl. ‚ÄúI need to talk to Ukiko.‚Äù 

‚ÄúOkay, I still got more Moon Warrior Lunalia to watch!‚Äù Ariane smiled. ‚ÄúWe will fight for everyone‚Äôs heart!‚Äù She then rushed back to the bean bag chair. 

Astral smiled and walked over to the kitchen. He stared at the pots and pans in the sink and the new utensils being used to cook a small meal of rice and fish. 

‚ÄúYou went all out.‚Äù Astral smiled, ‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWell you weren‚Äôt going to be going anywhere and I wasn't going to order every meal for a child.‚Äù She smiled, ‚ÄúOn the plus side, the doctor did teach me how to scramble eggs.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI mean...‚Äù Astral shrugged, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs fair, both of us seem to be tragedies in the kitchen.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYeah...‚Äù Ukiko nodded and put some of the food together. ‚ÄúFor her.‚Äù She nodded. 

Astral stepped aside.

‚ÄúAriane, I have dinner for you.‚Äù  Ukiko smiled.

‚ÄúThank you Miss Ukiko.‚Äù Ariane got up and sat at the table and quickly began to eat. 

Ukiko returned to the kitchen and looked Astral up and down. ‚ÄúYou do look much better, and your wings went back in after a few hours...‚Äù 

‚ÄúYeah, takes effort to bring them out and put them away.‚Äù Astral nodded, ‚ÄúI had nothing left. Incarnated daemons are tough enough, but that was a knight. I should be dead. Everyone on that train should be dead. We lucked out with a thaumaturgist being there.‚Äù

‚ÄúThaumaturgist, a wizard?‚Äù Ukiko asked.

‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs the term the Church uses. Humans that channel the angel's powers directly as a tool or weapon. Powerful and dangerous to piss off.‚Äù Astral sighed, ‚ÄúEven starting ones are powerful, if they survive the training.‚Äù 

‚ÄúOh.‚Äù Ukiko nodded, ‚ÄúYou were lucky.‚Äù 

Astral nodded again. ‚ÄúThank you, again. Really.‚Äù 

Ukiko nodded, ‚ÄúYou needed help. Even if you‚Äôre a client, you were also in need of help.‚Äù 

Astral smiled, ‚ÄúGood. Now what can we do to help Ariane?‚Äù 

‚ÄúI looked into her. She doesn‚Äôt exist.‚Äù Ukiko sighed, ‚ÄúA few social workers remember her, but they can‚Äôt ever keep paperwork on her and their bosses force them to move on.‚Äù 

‚ÄúSo she really is alone and forgotten.‚Äù Astral sighed, ‚ÄúAnything we can do?‚Äù 

‚ÄúI‚Äôve amended my lease and I can amend yours to have a plus one.‚Äù Ukiko sighed and watched his smile spread. ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt ignore her and she needs a real home. Not the streets.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou got a good heart.‚Äù Astral nodded, ‚ÄúGet mine amended...‚Äù He paused, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let the Chruch know why.‚Äù 

Ukiko blinked and nodded, ‚ÄúYou hate them so much. You really should just leave. They sent you here to die after all.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAnd now I‚Äòm where I need to be. Between a daemon-knight and his prey.‚Äù Astral nodded, ‚ÄúI just need to get a lot better very fast.‚Äù 

‚ÄúCan I do anything?‚Äù Ukiko asked.

‚ÄúIf you see a daemon-knight?‚Äù Astrals hook his head. ‚ÄúRun. Hope Ariane can hide you in the fog she makes.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI saw her use rain.‚Äù Ukiko nodded, ‚ÄúShe makes ghosts or apparitions in them. They were like memories moving in the droplets..‚Äù 

‚ÄúNeat, the fog can heal and likely hide.‚Äù Astral advised, ‚ÄúShe probably has more tricks she doesn‚Äôt even know.‚Äù  

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs more.‚Äù Ukiko looked worried, ‚ÄúDr. Mourning said she had low to nonexistent vital signs. I couldn‚Äôt hear a heartbeat.‚Äù 

Astral blinked, ‚ÄúThat narrows down possibilities, but it‚Äôs possible if she‚Äôs a mutant that she doesn't have the same vitals as us. But I‚Äôll look into it. I just need actual stuff to do so.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI‚Äôll get a computer and desk here tomorrow. And a child‚Äôs setup for both of our places. She can stay with me when you‚Äôre out and vice versa.‚Äù 

‚ÄúTrying to put her all on me?‚Äù Astral snorted, ‚ÄúNah, I get it. This is gonna be rough for both of us.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why, but she grows on you very fast.‚Äù Ukiko blushed a little, ‚ÄúI want to help her.‚Äù 

Astral nodded and smiled, ‚ÄúThe doc mentioned a business card?‚Äù 

‚ÄúOh!‚Äù She went over to his refrigerator and grabbed a black business card with an eclipse in the center and handed it to him. ‚ÄúInteresting name too.‚Äù 

Astral smiled and took the card, read the name and felt his pulse quicken. ‚ÄúThis is a joke, right?‚Äù 

Ukiko blinked in confusion, ‚ÄúIf it is, I‚Äôm not aware of it.‚Äù 

‚ÄúDr. Star Mourning?‚Äù Astral blinked in shock that she didn‚Äôt get it. 

Ukiko shrugged, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a traditional name, I know,  but he‚Äôs English.‚Äù 

‚ÄúFuck, he‚Äôs gonna be smug.‚Äù Astral flicked the card and it buried itself into the ceiling.

‚ÄúAstral!?‚ÄùUkiko tried to jump and pull it out. 

‚ÄúUkiko. Say that name in the traditional Japanese method.‚Äù Astral said with his tone heavy in seriousness. 

‚ÄúDr. Mourning Star.‚Äù She said it then paused and her eyes widened in fear. ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù Astral laughed, ‚ÄúFun fact, he‚Äôs not in Hell. He‚Äôs on Earth with all the other Fallen Angels.‚Äù 

Ukiko blinked again, ‚ÄúBut he helped you.‚Äù 

Astral laughed, ‚ÄúAnd he‚Äôs willing to train me.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so confused.‚Äù Ukiko sighed. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôll explain it all, but first I need food.‚Äù Astral nodded and looked at the kitchen. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll order out for us.‚Äù 

Ukiko nodded, ‚ÄúGet wine.‚Äù 

Astral laughed, ‚ÄúYeah. You‚Äôll need it.‚Äù He went back to his room to grab his phone.

I started 2025 at 255 lbs, and I've been on strict Carnivore since the new year, resulting in my weigh-in this morning at 237.8 lbs.  Woohoo!  To give a little more context, I've done Carnivore before with great success, but stopped and ended up gaining back more (255 is the heaviest I've ever been).  My BP still isn't falling as quickly as I would hope, but in general it seems to be... although this morning was a bit elevated, likely from waking up way later than I needed to and having to scramble for work...

My daily intake is pretty simple: one 20oz tumbler of black coffee and a 64oz jug of water in the AM, another 64oz jug of water throughout the afternoon/evening as well as a roughly 16oz ribeye steak pan-seared in ghee once I get home from work.  This is often plenty enough to keep me satiated without many cravings.  If I do get them, I may have either another small steak,  or a Jack Link's beef and cheese snack stick, but I still try to stay away from those if I can manage.

Here's my question: Is this too fast?  I'm only concerned because of the expressed concern of a good friend (who, admittedly, is naturally very thin, and doesn't do much ""dieting"" anyway, I just value his opinion/concern).  I've done Carnivore once before, also with great results, and am now committing to do something a bit longer term than the month or two that I did last time.

TLDR;  I'm losing a ton of weight quite quickly, and am personally very happy about it; but also mildly concerned I shouldn't be losing it so fast...",1,1737725866.0,carnivorediet,1,1.0,False

Equipment: origami air with cafec t92 paper. Felicita square kettle. Sansui kitchen scale.

Coffee: natural processed caturra from Miro Family bonita springs, Panama 

Observations:
Apart from obvious grind inconsistencies, both brews are generally nice given the good bean quality.

Timemore expresses sweetness and aroma massively, almost as if it‚Äôs off balance. Notes of red apple more prominent in taste and patchouli overly prominent in aroma. For someone starting their journey, the intensity would be very appealing and I‚Äôd probably recommend sticking to this level of grinder 

1zpresso blends those together in a more balanced way. Also, some extra notes of mixed berries expressed along with better aroma clarity of jasmine, rose and patchouli. Nothing too overly prominent nor muddled. Closer to cupping notes by roaster of: forest berries, orange and butter biscuit. For someone starting their journey, the notes are too clear and almost analytical / well separated.

It‚Äôs similar to cheap speakers focusing on non neutral coloration like say higher bass or higher treble. And expensive ones focusing on neutral coloration with great imaging / separation.

1i8v7cu,https://www.reddit.com/r/coldplunge/comments/1i8v7cu/preventing_afterdrop_with_sole_water/,Preventing afterdrop with Sole Water,"I‚Äôve been experimenting this week after I noticed that when I consumed about a liter of water with Himalayan salt, the normal after drop I got after plunging was nonexistent. Anyone else try/notice notice this?

Normally, I get into the plunge with only coffee in my system, and noticed that I would suffer from a lot of shaking as the blood from my core returned to my extremities. This week, I began a regimen of drinking about a teaspoon of Himalayan salt in water immediately upon waking, and noticed that my afterdrop was gone. It‚Äôs definitely not due to any external warming, as the weather has been chillier than normal this week. When I went online to find out why salt and hydration may affect the severity of an afterdrop, I found this info:

Drinking sole water (water saturated with Himalayan salt) before or after a cold plunge may help prevent an afterdrop‚Äîthe continued cooling of your core body temperature after leaving cold water‚Äîfor a few reasons. Here‚Äôs the breakdown:

1. Electrolyte Balance

Himalayan salt contains a mix of essential minerals like sodium, potassium, and magnesium, which help maintain electrolyte balance. Cold exposure can trigger your body to lose electrolytes through stress responses like increased urination (a phenomenon called cold diuresis). Electrolytes are crucial for proper muscle function, including the contraction of blood vessels that helps keep warm blood circulating to your core after a plunge.

2. Improved Circulation

Salt supports vascular health by encouraging the expansion and contraction of blood vessels. After a cold plunge, the body works hard to redirect blood from your extremities back to your core to warm up. Sole water may help this vascular adjustment occur more efficiently, reducing the risk of an afterdrop.

3. Hydration and Thermal Regulation

Proper hydration is essential for maintaining body temperature. Cold plunges increase fluid loss, so drinking sole water can replenish both water and electrolytes, ensuring your body has the resources to generate heat and maintain circulation. The minerals in Himalayan salt also help water absorption at a cellular level, keeping you optimally hydrated.

4. Nervous System Support

The minerals in Himalayan salt support the nervous system, which regulates thermoregulation during and after cold exposure. Sodium, for example, helps with nerve signaling, ensuring that your body reacts efficiently to the stress of the cold by maintaining homeostasis.

By combining hydration and mineral replenishment, sole water helps your body stay ready to handle the cooling effects of a cold plunge and prevent an excessive drop in core temperature after you exit the water.

1i8v4zt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i8v4zt,What should my next steps be?,"I need some advice on next steps for finishing this veneer coffee table. I bought it for 10 euros about a year ago. It was already in used condition with some mug stains so I didn't bother that much about how I used it which resulted in many more mug stains and candle wax etc. Yesterday I spontaneously started removing the lacquer that was left with a scraper since I was bored and had time on my hands. The table already looks a lot better but you can see on the second picture that there are some stain which still show up. That brings me to three areas I could use some advice on: 

1. Should I apply oxalic acid to try to lighten some of the stains? 
I have seen this in some videos by dashner design and restauration and it seems to be effective but I don't know if there are any risks or wether it's worth it. Again, my standards for this table are not too high and my main goal is to finish it to such a degree that no new stains will show up. Which brings me to my second point. 

2. What finish should I use to make the table last me a couple more years? (ideally without having to worry about how I use it too much) The only product I have on hand is a linseed/beeswax/carnaubawax mixture. I read that this should benefit the wood, but I don't know how much protection it would offer. Any Eu/Netherlands available product recommendations would be great. 
I also haven't removed the finish of any other part than the top because the rest still seems to be in good condition. I'm hoping anything with a clear coat will have the colours come out matching but thats just my guess right now. 

3. What should my order of operation be? 
This is my first time tackling such a project so I feel a bit in a dark about something I might be missing. This is what I'm currently thinking: 

1. Start (hand) sanding from 100 to 300 grit
2. Wipe clean with white spirit
3. (Potentially) Apply oxalic acid
4. Wipe clean with white spirit
5. Apply finish I have on hand
6. (Potentially) Apply second protective clear coat finish

Please let me know if I am missing anything! Thanks :)

The first thing to note is this: the Palestinians did not bow or surrender even as they stood there, practically defenceless, under the ceaseless onslaught of one of the deadliest military machines in the world. Israel on the other hand, with its jets, bombers, missiles, tanks, drones and the support of the US military and other western militaries, did not manage to enforce any of its stated war aims.

1i8uw5m,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1i8uw5m/can_athome_teeth_whitening_make_a_difference/,Can At-Home Teeth Whitening Make a Difference?,"Teeth whitening is one of those things you think about but never seem to get around to trying‚Äîat least that was me. I‚Äôd see ads and before-and-after photos and wonder if they were real or just edited for marketing. I‚Äôve tried whitening strips and ""whitening"" toothpaste in the past, but nothing seemed to make a noticeable difference. When I finally decided to give **Laughland teeth whitening** a shot, I wanted to approach it with realistic expectations. Here‚Äôs how it went and what I learned along the way.

# Why I Decided to Try Laughland

Like a lot of people, I love my coffee and tea, but over time, those drinks took a toll on my teeth. I noticed dullness and some stubborn stains that my regular toothpaste just couldn‚Äôt fix. Professional whitening at a dentist's office felt way too expensive, and I wasn‚Äôt up for the sensitivity that whitening strips caused me in the past.

Laughland caught my attention because it uses a **dentist-designed whitening gel** paired with an **LED mouthpiece**, which seemed more advanced than typical over-the-counter solutions. It promised noticeable results in just six days, which felt reasonable compared to products that claim instant results (but rarely deliver).

# What‚Äôs in the Laughland Whitening Kit?

When I opened the box, I found:

1. **Whitening Gel Pens**: These are easy to use and help apply the gel evenly to your teeth.
2. **LED Mouthpiece**: A device that activates the gel and boosts its whitening effect.
3. **Simple Instructions**: The step-by-step guide made everything easy to follow.

The whole setup felt simple yet professional. I didn‚Äôt feel overwhelmed by multiple steps or a messy process.

# How the Whitening Process Works

Each whitening session took only 10 minutes, which made it easy to fit into my routine. Here‚Äôs how it goes:

1. **Clean Your Teeth**: Start with clean, dry teeth for the best results.
2. **Apply the Gel**: Use the pen to apply the gel evenly across your teeth.
3. **Insert the LED Mouthpiece**: Pop it in, turn on the light, and let it work for 10 minutes.
4. **Rinse and Clean**: After the session, rinse your mouth and clean the mouthpiece.

It‚Äôs quick and easy‚Äîno mess, no hassle. I usually did mine while scrolling on my phone or watching TV.

# What I Noticed Over Six Days

* **Day 1**: No visible change yet, but my teeth felt super clean.
* **Day 3**: By the third session, I saw a subtle brightening, especially on the surface stains from coffee.
* **Day 6**: By the end of the cycle, my teeth were about 6‚Äì7 shades whiter. The change was noticeable but still looked natural.

The most surprising part? **No sensitivity.** I was really impressed by how gentle the process was, considering my past experiences with whitening strips that left my teeth aching.

# Why Laughland Stands Out

After trying several teeth whitening products before, I noticed some key differences with Laughland:

1. **Dentist-Formulated Gel**: This isn‚Äôt your average whitening gel‚Äîit‚Äôs designed to be effective but gentle, lifting stains without damaging enamel.
2. **LED Light Activation**: The LED mouthpiece enhances the gel‚Äôs performance, speeding up the whitening process and ensuring even results.
3. **Temperature-Controlled Ingredients**: Laughland‚Äôs gel is stored in a temperature-controlled facility to maintain its potency, unlike many drugstore products that degrade over time.

**Curious to see if it works for you? Check out the details** [**here**](https://getlaughland.com/offer-01/?lpid=1039&source_id=DL&utm_source=8928&utm_medium=&utm_term=1039&aff_id=8928&sub_id=&req_id=&oid=1039&device_type=&country_name=&oid=1039&affid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HealthProductsNatural)**.**

# How Laughland Compares to Other Whitening Methods

Here‚Äôs how Laughland stacked up against the other products I‚Äôve tried:

* **Whitening Strips**: Affordable but often uneven and caused major sensitivity.
* **Whitening Toothpaste**: Good for maintenance but doesn‚Äôt remove deep stains.
* **Professional Whitening Treatments**: Very effective but expensive and left me with sensitive teeth for days afterward.

Success Stories: Real Experiences from Total Life Changes Distributors
----------------------------------------------------------------------

In the world of multi-level marketing, personal stories can inspire new distributors and potential customers alike. Total Life Changes (TLC) is known for transforming lives through its health and wellness products, but it is also noteworthy for the positive experiences shared by its distributors. Learning from these real-life success stories can motivate you to consider joining this growing community.

One success story comes from Sarah, a mother of three who initially joined TLC seeking extra income. After starting her journey, she discovered a supportive community that encouraged her to develop her business skills. Within just a year, Sarah was able to replace her full-time job income by focusing on TLC's products and sharing her experiences. Now, she travels across the country to connect with other distributors, sharing how TLC changed her life.

Another inspiring story is that of Mark, who joined TLC as a side hustle while working a demanding 9-to-5 job. He was skeptical at first, unsure if he could make a real profit. However, Mark‚Äôs determination to succeed led him to actively participate in product training and promotional events. By leveraging social media, he built a strong personal brand, showcasing the benefits of TLC products. Fast forward two years, Mark could resign from his job and devoted himself fully to TLC, achieving financial freedom and flexibility.

Linda, a former healthcare worker, turned her passion for health and wellness into a successful TLC business. She emphasizes the importance of education and attends every training session TLC offers. Linda utilized her background in health to effectively communicate the benefits of the products to potential customers. Her unique perspective helped her build a loyal customer base, resulting in significant earnings through commissions and bonuses. She believes that staying committed to personal growth and learning is crucial for anyone in the MLM space.

Many distributors share how personal connections have played a pivotal role in their success. For instance, Jamie used her network from her previous job to promote TLC products. By hosting home parties and sharing product samples, she created a buzz in her community. She found that tasting the products firsthand made a significant impact on her sales. Jamie‚Äôs story reflects how leveraging existing connections can lead to increased visibility and sales.

Some distributors have also highlighted the immense support available through TLC‚Äôs network. For many, the community is a key factor in their achievements. For example, Michael recalls how joining a local TLC team helped him gain confidence and knowledge. He was able to learn directly from experienced distributors and apply their strategies. This collaboration not only helped Michael grow his team but also resulted in increased sales for everyone involved. Working alongside others allowed him to share challenges and celebrate victories, creating a sense of camaraderie.

**written with help from our good friend ChatGPT given I am too lazy and got a B in English Lit** 

For the past four months, I‚Äôve been on 50mg Elvanse, which I take in the morning with protein (avoiding vitamin C). It has significantly improved my productivity, helped me lose 3‚Äì4kg, curbed binge eating, and allowed me to maintain a strong work ethic while working from home.

However, a series of poor lifestyle choices recently culminated in a severe health scare. Here‚Äôs what happened:

*Background*

Initial Success: Elvanse improved my daily routine, but I developed a habit of supplementing it with coffee, especially on days I felt tired.

Back Injury: A few weeks ago, I injured my back and had to take 30mg co-codamol. While continuing to work from home, I stopped exercising, and my routine deteriorated.
	‚Ä¢	Irregular Sleep: I began staying up late, playing games from 8 pm to 2 am. My sleep dwindled to 5‚Äì6 hours a night, interrupted by my children in the morning.
	‚Ä¢	Caffeine Use: To combat sleep deprivation, I relied on coffee. This escalated to 3 cups a day (~400mg caffeine) on top of Elvanse.

*The Incident*

Two days ago, after my usual routine of Elvanse and coffee, I experienced sudden and severe chest pains that felt like a heart attack. The pain grew worse, and I became hysterical, fearing for my life because of my family and financial responsibilities.
	Symptoms:
	‚Ä¢	Chest pain
	‚Ä¢	Breathlessness
	‚Ä¢	Inability to speak or move properly
	‚Ä¢	Panic and a feeling of impending doom
	‚Ä¢	Emergency Visit:
	‚Ä¢	At A&E, I underwent tests (X-rays, ECG, bloodwork), all of which showed normal results:
	‚Ä¢	Heart rate: ~70
	‚Ä¢	Blood pressure: 120/80
	‚Ä¢	Diagnosis: A severe panic/anxiety attack combined with central nervous system overstimulation‚Äînot life-threatening but triggered by poor lifestyle habits.

*Key Takeaways*

This incident was a wake-up call. Despite working out, eating healthily, and using the sauna regularly, my sleep deprivation, excessive caffeine use, and sedentary routine had taken a toll.

Since then, I‚Äôve made immediate changes:
	1.	No Caffeine: I‚Äôve completely stopped drinking coffee.
	2.	Prioritising Sleep: I now aim for 8‚Äì9 hours of sleep each night.
	3.	Recovery: I‚Äôve taken time off work to focus on rest and proper nutrition.

Your lifestyle choices matter, far more than you might realise. Even with medication that supports productivity, neglecting fundamental habits like sleep, movement, and moderation can lead to severe consequences. My experience was terrifying, and while it wasn‚Äôt life-threatening, it felt like it could be.

If you‚Äôre using medication like Elvanse or managing a high workload, take this as a reminder:
	‚Ä¢	Respect your body‚Äôs limits.
	‚Ä¢	Avoid excessive caffeine or stimulants.
	‚Ä¢	Prioritise rest and recovery.

1i8ufjz,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1i8ufjz/lazy_persons_nofrills_recipe_for_incredible/,Lazy person's no-frills recipe for incredible coffee with minimal equipment,"I have the most unfortunate personality type combination of being a perfectionist while having zero motivation to actually put in the work required for perfection. However, once in a while, I get lucky and stumble on something that's nearly perfect with minimal effort. This recipe is one of those.

I'll provide the recipe for two kinds of people. One who has nothing else except access to hot water, a timer/phone and ground coffee (good, complex coffee that's relatively fresh, can't do much otherwise). While the other is for someone who has a scale, electric kettle and other modern equipment for brewing coffee.

**Level 1 (no equipment)**

* Get access to ground coffee from a good specialty roaster. Use a medium / medium fine grind. One they sell for filter or Moka e.g. If you can get them ground yourself, then make sure they're using a good grinder and purge out whatever amount of previous coffee was stuck in the grinder. 
* In a vessel of your choice put between 3-4 tablespoons of ground coffee.
* Prepare two timers. One for 4 minutes and another for 10 minutes. There's no free lunch, a chill recipe like this takes time. Don't start the timer, just get it ready.
* Now add slightly less than 1 cup of off the boil hot water to the grounds. It's probably better if you wait a minute or two after water has started boiling. But it may not be a big deal
* Start both timers.
* At 4 minutes, your coffee will have formed a crust, slowly break the crust with a spoon. don't agitate too much. Just the top part where the crust and foam hangout. If you are an impatient prick, take a few spoonfulls and taste the coffee. More importantly, if your coffee hasn't formed a crust at 4 minutes. It's not fresh, pull out a laptop and write an angry email to whoever sold you the coffee. 
* At around 10 minutes, your coffee should be done brewing and as a bonus reward for your patience, the coffee grounds would have sunk at the bottom as well. Gently pour off the brewed coffee in a drinking vessel, making sure you don't disturb the settled grounds. If you are clumsy or uncomfortable with this step, borrow your mother's chai ki channi and pass the brew through that.
* You're done. Take a loud slurp, keep it in your mouth long enough to enjoy all the beautiful flavors before gulping it all down.

**Level 2 (French Press/Inverted AeroPress/Channi)**

* Grind14 grams of medium fine, fresh, good quality coffee (around 23 on comandante or 600-micron burr gap, use this [Coffee grind size chart | Honest Coffee Guide](https://honestcoffeeguide.com/coffee-grind-size-chart/) to convert to your grinder). 
* Add 93-96 degrees of 225 ml water.
* At 4 minutes break the crust gently.

* You're done. Enjoy the brew, you should feel all the fruity notes as well as the full body of the coffee. There should be no astringency or unpleasant bitterness.
* Because you have access to a grinder, play around with the grind size. Finer should give more body and a lingering after taste at the cost of the acidity and fruitiness, while coarser grinds will have the opposite effect.

I‚Äôm F22 and usually pretty gassy and always have been, and it really turns me on. It really doesn‚Äôt matter what I eat sometimes I just can‚Äôt help them slipping out‚Ä¶

Yesterday morning was particularly bad whilst I was in work however. I stack shelves in retail and my gas is usually at its worst in the mornings and to make things worse I had coffee that morning too. About an hour into my shift I could feel my stomach starting to bubble and I just knew I was about to stink the place up. I bent down to pick up a box and a small bubbly fart slipped out. Luckily no one was close enough to hear, but the smell was instant, like rotten eggs and shit. But there was so much more to come out. It felt like so was ripping farts non stop for about 5 minutes straight with them slowly getting a little louder each time, each one rumbling out of my work pants. I decided to head upstairs to the staff bathrooms and see if I could push out the rest, by this point I so wet and could see customers look of disgust as they walked through my fart cloud as I left. When I got into the bathroom I kept farting for around another 10 minutes, most of them loud and little wet too, but I loved every second of it.

I (21F) have always had a good relationship with my mother (46F) and that didn't change after my parents divorced for personal reasons. However, things took a turn when my stepfather (37M) entered our lives. My mother has always been a bit eccentric, but she was never hurtful, and she always made sure my older sister (23F) and I felt loved. 

That changed when she started dating my stepfather. While I got along with him and he respected my privacy, my mother started acting differently. At first, it was subtle things like, ""You two spend a lot of time together,"" and ""You‚Äôre getting really friendly."" I brushed it off, mostly because I didn‚Äôt thought much of it. My stepfather and I only spent time together when I visited my mom. Yes, we joked around, but it was harmless and never inappropriate‚Äîjokes like, ""Looking like death today, huh?""

As time passed, my mother‚Äôs comments became more aggressive. I started to distance myself from both of them to avoid ruining the good relationship we had, though I didn‚Äôt know what I was doing wrong. One day, my mother invited me over for coffee and cake, and during our conversation, she suddenly asked if I had feelings for my stepfather. I was caught off guard, shocked, and mostly confused. I told her no and asked why she thought that. She said it was because we were too close to just be friends, and she noticed the way he looked at me.

I reassured her that, while we got along well, I only saw him as a father figure and didn‚Äôt feel anything romantic toward him. I also reminded her that she‚Äôd always wanted us to get along. But then she got angry, accusing me of lying and insisting she wasn‚Äôt blind. The conversation escalated, and I stood up, telling her that the whole thing was ridiculous. I left, and she began texting me things like, ""I can't believe my own daughter would betray me,"" among other hurtful things. 

I didn‚Äôt respond and talked to my older sister about it. She advised me to not engage with our mother for a while, saying that she thought our mom was acting completely out of character. So, I took her advice and stopped visiting and talking to my mother.

It‚Äôs been two months of no contact, and today I received a message from her asking if we could meet up to talk about what happened.

And this is kind of a vent and I‚Äôm not really looking for advice, but I would be intrigued by any similar experiences. 

I think these better quality, roasted within the last week coffees either have more caffeine or maybe it‚Äôs just not degraded by sitting on a shelf for a month. Before, with grocery store coffee, I could count on a reasonable bump of 20-30 points and it would level off. 

You might think this is foot to floor, which I do experience but I‚Äôve tailored my basal to account for it and I start to get a significant increase in basal about an hour before I actually get out of bed at 6am. I do, however, have coffee in my hands within 15 minutes of getting up. And the mornings when I get up later, or the rare occasions I run out of coffee and have to wait until I get to the office, this just happens at the office. 

I typically don‚Äôt bolus for coffee because I find the caffeine to be quick in my system and I don‚Äôt put creamers or sugar or anything in my coffee except a little splash of half and half. This morning I tried half a unit right when I got up to try and counteract this to no avail, and what you‚Äôre seeing is only half of my mug, if that. The other issue is because it‚Äôs caffeine and I‚Äôm on an automated system, my pod tried to correct this and I end up driving to work 69‚ÜòÔ∏è and then rollercoaster all day.

SQ is my org‚Äôs preferred airline and the policy is we are afforded business class seats for flights > 3 hours.

I‚Äôve now flown 8 business class flights in total - something I could never justify on trips for pleasure with friends and family!

So as someone still very new to the experience, here are some things I have noticed and appreciated about SQ business class, perhaps things regulars have take for granted! Are these uniform across most airlines?

- They greet and address you by your name each time.

- They welcome you with warm, lightly scented towel and your choice of champagne, orange juice, or apple juice.

- Meals are full course, with white linen table covers and silverware. Appetizers, bread rolls, entree, dessert, and coffee/tea, in that order. Always so delicious!

- Toilets too are better appointed, with towels, higher end personal effects, and full length mirrors.

- Noise cancelling earphones! 

- Need I mention the obvious: lounge access, fully reclinable seats, thicker blankets, larger pillows

What are some things I failed to mention vis a vis other airlines? How can I better maximize and enjoy this rare opportunity? :) ",12,1737721802.0,singaporeairlines,9,1.0,False
1i8u9cl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1i8u9cl/aio_to_my_boyfriends_female_best_friend/,AIO to my boyfriend's female best friend?,"To preface, I am now separated from that boyfriend for completely unrelated reasons but would like to get a perspective on things that happened during our relationship. The post will be written as if things are currently happening right now. 

I (25F) have been dating Jay (34M) for 2.5 years now, and for a while (~2 years) he has had a female best friend who's also one of his coworkers, Alice (26F). She works part time while he works full-time. 

Alice and Jay have become quite close over time, sometimes calling each other late at night and texting each other ""good night"". One time I saw that she texted him lots of ‚ù§ emojis just as he was replying to one of her texts, and he told me that she's ""like that with everyone"", but he said he would tell her to cut it out to avoid making me uncomfortable. 

They don't seem to have a lot of boundaries between them and as such they know about each other's deepest secrets and their respective sex lives. Jay has also told me that he finds Alice attractive (to be fair, she is, and I am not asking him to be blind lol), especially when she wears a specific item that I know he likes on women. 

He gives her a lot of rides to her place because she doesn't have a car and spends one-on-one time with her sometimes. When we're the three of us together I sometimes feel left out because they have so many inside jokes and neither of them can stop laughing when around the other... it's slightly awkward for me and I have felt like a third wheel in my own relationship at times when she's there. 

The thing that worries me even more is that Alice has had a tendency to go after taken people in the past, twice, and ofc this has been on the back of my mind a lot. She also has a tendency to want men's validation and has exhibited that behavior with other coworkers too, and that coworker's wife got mad at her and it created a lot of drama. 

I'm trying my hardest not to be the typical ""jealous girlfriend"" archetype here and to cut Alice and Jay some slack, but something seems fishy here on my end. 

I don't think there's any physical cheating going on but from my perspective I feel like it's awfully close to emotional cheating. 

AIO ? I feel like I'm going crazy sometimes. 

By the way, my boyfriend has other female friends, but NONE of them are as close. At most he will meet them for coffee here and there or text them sporadically.

I went to a spa for a Green coffee enema yesterday, and within two minutes of insertion the nervous system attack I was having at the time dropped significantly. I stopped reacting to things and places I previously reacted to since then. I was able to sleep about 4 hours last night without meds(a rarity for me). I sometimes would take Nystatin to help slightly curb symptoms. Some weirdly shaped things came out I must say. I'm not sure what to think of this significant dropoff in symptoms/reactivity due to the enema.
Could it be parasites? Cleansing candida? Cleansing toxins buildup in colon? 
It's truly significant the change I feel in the last 30 hours or so.

Instead, what I found was a newly refurbished Ramada Inn (literal past property use) where the heat was literally off in the room- 58 as I entered (the hallway was also unheated; at night towels were placed by the hallway door and adjoining room-connector door to conserve heat). Asked for another room, and this time received the suite I should have, as a Titanium member, started with, however the heat was also off, so it was also 58! After more than an hour, the temperature was less than 70 (68). As it was a long day, and I was hoping to warm up, I turned on the shower, and after 30 minutes the temperature near made it past luke warm (though it worked fine the next morning). 

In the morning, walking thru the sub-60 hallway, while getting to-go coffee with no kids, and seeing non-operable fitness equipment, multiple staff confirmed the property was going through ‚Äòteething pains‚Äô. 

A few days later I wrote to tell the GM about my experiences, praise a staff member and make some suggestions (e.g. provide a voucher for free breakfast, not a dollar limited voucher that would not cover one item and coffee). She was understanding, but said some clearly unacceptable BS like, the HVAC is turned off ‚Äòfor the environment‚Äô (it‚Äôs a pretty basic, and not unreasonable expectation that a guest walk into a room that is not 58!) and avoided other issues like how to-go coffee could be offered with no lids (sounds like a potential lawsuit as well if you remember the McDonald‚Äôs case hot coffee spill from years ago). Anyhow, after a follow-up saying how unhappy I was with the experience, she offered  2,000 points ($14 value). 

How do I effectively express my disappointment about this to Marriott?

TLDR: Booked Tribute hotel for relaxing getaway, received freezing room and cold (not hot enough to be useable) shower. Management made excuses not amends.

I wanted to share my blind shaker experiments.
I was on the verge of buying a shaker and decided to try the workflow out first with what I had at home.
I just put a lid on my grinder's cup, shook it up, dumped into the basket, tapped, tamped, and done.

Surprise surprise, this works better than my elaborate WDT dance routine xD
Using this I never get any channelling, versus minor channelling in ~25% of my WDT shots. However, it did change the taste, my shots are more acid (which I don't like) with the shaker. I corrected this by grinding finer and have found my perfect tasting shots again.

So I will not buy a gadget to do what an old cup & a lid do just fine. I'll be using this method for the time being, I'll report back if I stumble on any new findings.
I made a video of the process in case some of this was not clear, but really all I'm trying to say is that the blind shaker method works better than WDT for me, without expensive gadgets.

1i8u0jb,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThailandTourism/comments/1i8u0jb/thailand_beginner_itinerary_feedback/,Thailand Beginner Itinerary Feedback,"Hi everyone!

I‚Äôm planning my first trip to Thailand this April and would love some feedback on the itinerary I‚Äôve put together. I‚Äôm feeling pretty confident about the first leg of the trip but am torn about the second half, and I could use some advice from seasoned travellers.

# Planned Itinerary (First Leg):

1. **Bangkok (3 Nights)**: Exploring temples, markets, and enjoying some rooftop bars. This leg feels solid, and I‚Äôm excited to dive into the culture and vibrant city vibes.
2. **Chiang Mai (3 Nights)**: Planning to experience Songkran Festival (April 13), visit an ethical elephant sanctuary, and check out the temples and Old City.
3. **Krabi (4 Nights, Ao Nang)**: Focusing on activities like the Four Islands Tour, a trip to Railay Beach, and exploring the Emerald Pool and Tiger Cave Temple.

# The Dilemma: Khao Lak vs. Koh Tao

For the last segment of the trip (3 nights), I‚Äôm torn between staying in **Khao Lak** or making the effort to travel to **Koh Tao**:

# Option 1: Khao Lak

* My plan here would be to use Khao Lak as a base for:
   * A day trip to **Khao Sok National Park** (Cheow Lan Lake).
   * A snorkelling trip to the **Similan Islands**.
* It‚Äôs much easier logistically from Krabi (just a \~2.5-hour drive). I can then head to Phuket for my flight back to Bangkok.

# Option 2: Koh Tao

* I‚Äôd love to spend a few days on Koh Tao because the vibe seems more aligned with what I enjoy‚Äîwalking around, finding cool coffee shops, and sipping a cocktail while watching the sunset.
* BUT‚Ä¶ getting there is a hassle:
   * It would require a flight or long transfer to Surat Thani, followed by a ferry (\~6-8 hours total).
   * Leaving Koh Tao for Bangkok would also be time-consuming (ferry + flight), meaning I‚Äôd lose 1-2 days of the trip.
   * It's also much more expensive to fly to Bangkok from Koh Samui than it is from Sarut Thani, Krabi or Phuket (3-4x the price).
   * I‚Äôd likely have to skip **Khao Sok National Park**, which I‚Äôm keen to visit.

# Alternative Idea: Island Stay in Krabi?

If I decide against Koh Tao, I‚Äôm considering spending a night on an island while in Krabi‚Äîmaybe Railay Beach, Koh Phi Phi (non-party areas), or Hong Island. My vibe is super chill: I love sunsets, cocktails, and relaxing music. I *despise* party scenes like Magaluf or the Ibiza strip, so I‚Äôm looking for something quieter and more serene but still a nice atmosphere.

# Questions for You:

1. **Khao Lak vs. Koh Tao:** Which would you recommend based on my itinerary and vibe? Is Koh Tao worth the logistical hassle, or does Khao Lak offer enough for a fulfilling end to my trip?
2. **Island Stay in Krabi:** Is it worth spending a night on an island like Railay Beach or Koh Phi Phi to make up for skipping Koh Tao? Are there quieter areas that fit my vibe?
3. **Any Other Suggestions?** If there‚Äôs something I‚Äôm missing that would balance this trip better, I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts!",0,1737720860.0,ThailandTourism,0,0.5,False
