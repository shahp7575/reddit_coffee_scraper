1ht9q19,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ht9q19,BTS with Lumix S1h Rig my first Short Film where I was the DoP / Gaffer ,"A guy asked me via Email if I want to be the DoP for his Short film. 2.5 days of shooting. 
One day in a empty flat
One day in a bakery
One day in a park
Friend of mine joined second day for bts pictures and help :)

Total Length of the movie will be maybe 10 Minutes. 
Some love Story and time travel I didnt got it completely ^^
We shot in proRes HQ and internal 6k with the S1h. 

Some scenes look like crap. 
Some scenes look fantastic 💪
Fantastic because we took enough time to prepair my light setup. 
Light setup Was 1 Nanlite Forza 300 Bi Color 
2 x 60 Watt Godox
1 Zhiyun 60watt Rgb light <<~~~~~ Saved our ASS! 

This little light with battery is SO HANDY!
I used it so much it is fantastic. 

Mostly it was fun. 
But some of the directors Vision was in my opinion crap and made the Film worse.
But I didnt complain because it was his 2. time beeing a director for his own project. 
Passion project. 
My Payment Was energy drinks and Pizza as much as I needed lol.

Was a nice experience to shoot something different from commercials or Events. Working with actors is interesting. You need a good amount of Empathie what the director didnt had. But Overall Was a good mood on the Set I think. 
Maybe I make a little bts Youtube Video about this experience :) ",3,1735977783.0,Lumix,0,1.0,False

1ht9m15,https://i.redd.it/gcziiutunxae1.jpeg,"This door in the I guess, FBI, nyt exclusive crime scene walk through.","It's a terrible picture but that's part of the problem I'm pointing out. You don't have to look closely to prove it wrong.

Ive had my home searched by the police before. Not for bombs but my brothers ex called and said he had a gun. They didnt close a single cabinet door. Everything was on the floor or a nearby flat surface so that things could be opened and inspected. There were no books left on shelves. There was nothing left in the cabinets. It was on the floor or a counter top where they inspected anything that might hold a bic lighter. Every bed was flipped up against the wall and the sheets taken off as they looked for hidden holes in the mattress itself. 

The place in the video was not searched by police for evidence.

As a carpenter. Ive installed thousands of doors. Commercial and residential. Those are glass pannels. They hit the door hard enough to apparently take the door off the hinges but it didnt break the glass? Why is it still in the doorway? if theyve searched it and had forensic teams in and out, bomb squad probably cleared the place. No one would leave the door in the way. Why break the door off the hinges? Break a glass panel and unlock it.

Look at the door. The door swings out. Why is that fence right by her knees. Shes outside walking into the bomb makers house. Thats why the weirdly placed fence is hanging out on the front porch like my buds and i back in the day. The fence can't be inside the house. I mean it can but youd have a hard time finding a contractor to do it. They would have had to smash the whole door through the jamb. Look at the jamb and the strike plate. Then the door. They rammed it? Without breaking the glass? But why not just break the glass and unlock it? Why are the deadbolt and door knob missing if they kicked it in. Why is the door jamb damaged if they didnt? As an experienced tradesman, I can ALLKey any door knob or deadbolt on the market. I can open this door without kicking it in and setting off a potential bomb. This is a bomb guy remember?

If this is fake why isn't the government disputing it?

Its like the FBI hired CNN to make evidence backing up their theory but CNN didn't have anything but college graduates to stage the scene. 

Or am I crazy?

I know this isn't a standard feature, but I'm considering using an Arduino to create a macro. This would trigger a single shot, wait for the machine to signal readiness by the way of the green LED, then repeat three times.

My main concern is integrating this solution aesthetically. I want it to look clean, as the coffee machine is on the counter in a visible place.

I RAN to the GI next day and got a endoscopy last week, and got diagnosed with “moderate gastritis with shallow ulcerations, erythema and some granularity to gastric body” and I’m still waiting for pathology results.

My biggest symptom is nausea, especially at night when I lay down to sleep. This is extra annoying because I already have hard time sleeping. I’m also worried because this was my first semi invasive exam and the result is BAD. I have severe health anxiety and Im scared this will develop to something worse.

Below are my plan and vent to heal from gastritis, please feel free to advice me.

1. Have breakfast (I didn’t eat breakfast before, just coffee)
2. Have a single shot Americano after food (I know I should cut it out, but it is impossible so I’m cutting down from 3 shots to 1)
3. Be more lenient with Invisalign wear time (I started Invisalign 4 months ago and I can take it off 2 hrs a day for cleaning eating drink hot bev etc. I’ve realized that I now just shoved the food down to my throat in order to meet the e time limit)
4. No spicy foods, no instant noodles, no alcohol (I’m Korean so it is very hard)
5. Walking around after dinner to help digestion 
6. Added cabbage, bananas, alkaline water, slippery elm supplement
7. Pantoprazole 40mg every morning; if my night nausea gets bad I take a Pepcid AC or 15ml pepto as needed 
8. Stacked pillow to sleep but it hurts my back after a while

1ht9eps,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodylanguage/comments/1ht9eps/my_friend_was_behaving_weird_in_front_of_his_gf/,My friend was behaving weird in front of his GF and straying her away from me at an event. ,"My friend R and I are good friends from university. It's been years we know each other and many a times everyone joked around that we might get married because we are so close. That never happened though. 

Now he has a girlfriend and has been in a relationship since 4 years so I never bought up anything. I am currently single and he knows every detail of my breakup. 

He stays very close to my place and we regularly bump into each other and meet up for coffee and catch ups too which are very long talk sessions. 

There was a house viewing recently which R and I were interested in. Alongside we have a common friend who was the one initially inviting me for the  viewing. I knew R was going to be there but he never mentioned that he will bring along his GF. 

When I was at the viewing I met V, R's girlfriend. This was our first ever meeting and he never introduced me to her before. 

R was uncomfortable and was moving V away physically from the area I was in constantly. The viewing consisted of two plots so he took her to another one and I was with our other friend at another area. 

There was a point where the agent was explaining something and I wanted R's opinion so I turned back and he didn't even look at me and just gave a very cold answer. It's not just him, even our common friend was trying to seperate us constantly and was trying to distract me. 

This made me a bit anxious and I got on a call with another friend for an opinion because I have limited knowledge about houses. 

So I was busy on a call and in front of me these three sat and R was looking away from me all the time.

I ended the call, discussed with agent seperately and left. It was late at night and R didn't even offer to walk to the car and instead put his arms around his GF and exited from another area all together. Our common friend walked with me and then he seemed like he was trying to distract me too with random questions.

Even though I had not met V before I was excited to see her and now I don't even know what she must be thinking of me and I don't know why R and our common friend were acting this way. 

After this incident, R didn't speak to me for a good few days and things are back to normal now. He still meets me, we still talk a lot. I didn't bring up this incident because I didn't understand what's going on. 

Also, recently he hosted a new year's party where all our friends were invited but he never mentioned it to me and didn't invite me. I got to know from our common friend about it. When that friend asked R if he should invite me, R mentioned No he doesn't want to. 

Why is R trying to hide me? When its just us he is a different person, more relaxed and joking around and helping me with everything. He constantly even comments on how my hair are stylish and my clothing choices. 

TLDR: My friend behaves awkwardly around his girlfriend and tries to avoid me.

After feedback from this community I bought a step-ip transformer and got it to turn on.

It was sitting unused for probably 8-9 years, collecting dust. I cleaned it thoroughly and put water-vinegar through it twice and then just pure water twice again.

It seems to work mostly, however it is sputtering through the portafilter a lot. Whether it's with coffee or without.

Video:

Just water / coffee shooting out the two portafilter outlets at high speeds painting my kitchen walls.

Any idea why, what this is? Do I need to replace the gasket? But it's not leaking from the portafilter / machine connection, just sputtering out the sides.

I've heard of a two-way pin for the portafilter, would that solve the issue?

Also the coffee that came out was very bitter and acidic, almost burnt, slightly stale. Is that the beans that I'm using or did I not clean the machine well enough?

Thank you in advance!

EDIT; Double-checked, both portafilter inserts I have are pressurized. So I just bought the crema pin on Amazon, hopefully it'll work to fix the sputtering!",1,1735976370.0,gaggiaclassic,0,1.0,False
1ht9e7y,https://www.reddit.com/r/cf4cf/comments/1ht9e7y/33_m4f_seattle_wa_looking_for_a_kind_and_caring/,"33 [M4F] #Seattle, WA - Looking for a kind and caring long term partner","Hello, thanks for stopping to read my post. I really am hoping to find a childfree partner in my area. I have posted here before and wanted to updated my post since it has been a while since I posted.

* myself :

I am 33yo, tall (6’1”), ~170lbs (slim/average build), handsome black male. I have dark brown eyes. My hair is black and so is my beard. I normally keep my hair pretty short. I am happy to exchange photos early on to ensure there is a mutual attraction. I am college educated and I work as a software engineer. 

I consider myself to be kind, caring, and communicative. I have a pretty easy going and go with the flow kind of personality.

My interests are mostly of the nerdy variety; video games, computers, new technology, Marvel/DC stuff, pop culture stuff in general, etc. When it comes to video games I am mostly a pc gamer. I play a lot of Overwatch 2 with friends, but I mostly like single player games .Recently I have been playing ton of Marvel Rivals it so broken and fun right now lol. I am really looking forward to Monster Hunter Wilds next month. Some of my favorite games are Zelda (pretty much all of them), Fallout (NV, 3), The Witcher 3, Transistor, Bastion, Final Fantasy 7, Hollow Knight, and much more.

If I’m not playing games I’m usually steaming something to watch. Community, Parks and Recreation, Futurama, and Avatar: TLA are among my favorite shows. I am currently watching Silo on Apple TV+ and I am really excited for the season Severance. I like anime as well, but I don’t watch it as much as I use to. Dan Da Dan was my favorite anime of 2024.

On weekends I like to go out with friends. Usually to a chill bar/brewery or some event that is happening around the city. I’m not a super outdoorsy person, but I don’t mind a hike or going on a day trip somewhere. I love the rain, so I will go for a walk when it is raining some times. Its been so rainy recently and i have been loving it. I love to travel, but who doesn’t? My favorite travel destination so far has been Japan. There are many other places I want to visit, like South Korea, the UK, the Netherlands, and many more.

I don’t think I have to say this, but just in case I do NOT want kids. I have known it for a very long time and I recently got a vasectomy. I am non-religious and left-wing politically. 

I am currently located in Seattle near downtown and I live on my own. I do not smoke, or do drugs. I socially drink and I usually keep it to the weekends with friends.

* What I am looking for:

I am hoping to find a nice girl (cis-female) around my age (but preferably younger than myself). Someone that is kind/sweet, open minded, easy going, and communicative. 

I want there to be a mutual attraction and it is important to me. If you don’t feel attracted to me for some reason I just ask that you be honest about it. I will give you the same courtesy in return. I would say appearance-wise I prefer women with longer hair. I also tend to prefer women that are White or Asian. It’s not necessarily a deal breaker though.

Playing video games is one of my biggest hobbies and while it would be nice to have that in common with my partner it is not a requirement. If you aren’t into video games I just ask you aren’t opposed to me playing them. 

Please be drug and disease free. Alcohol and weed are both ok. I don’t like cigarettes, so no cig smokers please. 

This is where I might lose some of you, but that’s okay. I want us to be able to discuss our sexual preferences/interests. I don’t want it to be a guessing game. Sex is a huge part of an intimate relationship, and it would be great if we could have an honest conversation about it at some point. If we aren’t a match in that area then we can both move on. Without being too graphic I would say I am NOT vanilla in this regard. Having a conversation to see if we align would be great.

I would like someone I can see face to face. I in no way want a long distance relationship or a pen pal. If you are not in greater Seattle area then please do not reach out.

If you closely fit what I am looking for, please reach out and send me a chat. I would love to exchange photos and chat a bit. If things seem like a good fit I would love to meet for a casual coffee date somewhere in the city. 

I appreciate you reading my post and I hope to hear from you. If you made it this far and feel we aren’t a match then best of luck in your search.",2,1735976360.0,cf4cf,0,1.0,False

i feel like im stressing about it too much but im scared of losing her if she gets diabetes or falls or something happens because i love her and shes my biggest role model. shes the prettiest woman i know and all i want as her daughter is for her to be healthy :(

she gets starbucks coffee every morning and if anyone has any at home recipes for something that tastes like a double tall iced mocha with whip (yes thats her order lol, fancy ik) PLSSS lmk :,)

shes said she wants to get healthier for the past year but she hasnt committed to it and since its a fresh year i want her to start getting back into shape for her mental and physical health. being overweight really messes with her brain and whenever she has a panic attack because shes gained weight it makes me sad to see because i dont want my mother to be sad over something she can fix with commitment. 

am i overreacting when i say im concerned or is it concerning?

ive been asking for a gym membership so i can use the treadmill bc i love treadmills lol, and shes said we can do the PF near our house since its affordable... but she asked if itd be ok if my dad comes with instead. which yeah i love my dad but like hes already doing the stuff at home and honestly hes said he doesnt like gyms, so i wouldnt want to put that on him. 

also she could be on the treadmill next to me and just like walk for an hour, right? go at her own pace? idk maybe im just going crazy but i want her to be happy and healthy

1ht9c10,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ht9c10/i_think_my_husband_has_been_replaced/,I think my husband has been replaced,"Something's going on with my husband and I need help!

My husband’s family has always been weird, but I never really went out of my way to pay any attention to it. When we turned 16 my now husband, Gabriel, proposed. I was extremely hesitant, I mean what 16-year-old is actually ready to get married? I wanted to argue, but both our pushed for me to agree.  I knew deep down it was wrong but I figured my parent knew what was best so I trusted them blindly. However, I see now that my parents only wanted the extreme wealth that came with our marriage. A month after our marriage his family shipped us off to his dad's old cabin in the mountains. Though I personally think it's too big to be considered a cabin. I didn't want to move here, we’re almost an hour away from civilization in any direction, but again his family insisted on it. 

They claimed this house was more important than any family heirloom. Though I think it was just because it was so far from anyone I couldn’t go anywhere when my husband lost his temper. I am now 19 and have grown to love this house, Gabe on the other hand, hates it. At first, he was excited to live here, but after his family came over earlier this year, he’d just wanted to leave, but never actually did. When they came over, his parents and sister said something that made him uneasy. I left to get some more food from the kitchen when I saw they were saying something to him, they all seemed to be excited but it seemed to shake him deeply, he seemed scared, or on edge. I asked him what was wrong, but he just lashed out at me. Since then his behavior had been getting increasingly more, violent, but the last week has been the weirdest. 

I woke up to cold air blowing on my face. I opened my eyes to see the windows were open, I sat up confused when I noticed Gabe wasn’t in bed. I threw the blankets off of me and closed the windows before walking down the stairs. Each step seemed to get colder and colder. I held my arms close together, it was dark, but I could still see a little from the moonlight. The doors were wide open, and I could see someone was standing outside, looking away from me, entranced by whatever was deeper through the tree line. I timidly walked out to the porch where I could clearly see it was Gabe. I rushed out into the snow, the icy ground stung my feet the deeper I got into the woods. When I reached him I called his name gently and placed a hand on his shoulder, he turned his head to me slowly, and looked me in the eyes. He looked as if he didn’t even know me. He looked around and saw the house behind him. He looked at it for a while, his eyes squinted. I asked him what was wrong but all he said was “Sorry.” before walking back inside. 

I tried to get him to communicate further but to no avail. When we made it inside I noticed he wasn’t wearing any shoes or even socks. He must’ve been freezing, but he seemed unbothered, still I urged him to take a warm bath. I watched as he walked upstairs before I started preparing him some soup. I stirred mindlessly wondering if he had been sleepwalking. He’d never sleepwalked, he’d never even sleep-talked, why would he be doing it now? I reached for the bowl next to me and poured some soup. I turned around to see him sitting at the island. Startled, I dropped the soup all over me and the floor, I cowered on the floor, expecting him to scold me, but he didn’t. I looked up to see him wiping the soup off the floor quietly. When he noticed I was looking at him he smiled and helped me up. 

He felt my hands shaking and asked me why, but not in his usual taunting tone, he meant it. My brows furrowed in confusion. Why was he acting like this? Did he have a concussion? I was so lost. I took my hand away slowly and said I was just worried he’d be upset. He looked at me perplexed. I didn’t know what to say, I just got up and poured him another bowl. He finished cleaning the floor before even thinking about touching the bowl. As he ate I told him I would be going to bed. I rushingly changed and plopped myself onto the bed before drifting off to sleep.

I woke up early in the morning to see Gabe standing over me. I sat up quickly, he smiled shyly and said he wanted to thank me for last night. I asked what he meant by that, but he just smiled wider and led me downstairs and that’s when I saw he had prepared breakfast for both of us. I looked at him baffled. I asked him why he would make us breakfast. He simply shrugged, repeated that he wanted to thank me, and ushered me to eat. We ate at the table in silence, I glanced over at him occasionally, but he didn’t seem to notice, he was too busy eating, he must’ve been hungry because he had almost three different stacks of pancakes. After I took our plates he walked up behind me and asked if I liked the food I smiled sheepishly and said that I did.

He nodded with satisfaction and walked upstairs to the shower. It’s been like this for almost a week now. He hasn't lost his temper once, he’s been talking with me instead of locking himself away, helping me with meals, laughing, smiling, and he’s been so soft with me. I just don’t understand this sudden change. I tried to do some research to see if he had a concussion, but It just doesn’t seem right. I don’t know why he left the house, why he was standing out there in barely any clothes, or what the hell he was looking at, but after his family came over to talk last night, it just brought me more questions. When his family arrived, you might've thought it was a damn holiday with the number of people, over 25 family members chatting in my living room.

I rushed upstairs and told Gabe his family was here. He looked at me confused a small smirk creeping on his face as if I was lying, I reminded him, that we had planned this for a while. He nodded and we walked down to the dining room and hugged his mother tight, he’d never done that, he usually just sits right down and waited for them to speak first. I could see the look of surprise on everyone's faces. After everyone was done getting their fair share of my husband's love, we all sat down and ate dinner. His father, cousins, and sister were talking nonstop until his mother spoke up randomly.

“Gabe is something the matter.”

Gabe was just staring out the window, he obviously hadn’t noticed his mother was talking to him until I lightly tapped his hand and glanced over to his mother. He shook his head and smiled up at everyone, before looking down at his food and taking a bite of his mashed potatoes. His parents looked at each other before his sister leaned forward.

“Do you remember when you turned 15 and we all went on that skiing trip?”

Gabe looked at her blankly for a second. “Uh…Yeah, I do.” He said smiling.

His sister laughed in relief and practically jumped up in her seat. Everyone did the same, except for his niece who sat in silence playing with her food. Everyone else was so joyful, that his Uncle and Father ran out to grab some drinks from the car. I looked over at Gabriel, who was being aggressively hugged by his mother and other relatives. Dinner was awkward after that, his entire family seemed so giddy, but I felt I was the only one left out. After cleaning the table with his nephew, I noticed Gabe and his father talking outside. I looked at them closer, they looked like they were arguing. Gabe looked more sad than upset while his father was practically fuming with anger. I looked back at his nephew who simply pretended not to notice. After Gabe and his father walked inside Gabe just walked to the kitchen in silence.

I was about to walk after him when his mother approached me and for the first time, asked if everyone stay the night. I agreed and went to set up the guest rooms. I was wiping down the side tables when Gabe walked in. He was quiet but I could feel his eyes watching me. I sat up and tuned to him. He simply walked next to me and took the cloth from my hand before wiping down the table himself. His eyes looked sad and on the verge of tears.

This was not my husband.

Well it was, it had to be unless my husband has a doppelganger who’s identical to him down to his broken nose, it had to be him, but why was he acting so different? I took his arm and pulled him to look at me. His green eyes looked at me with such softness I hadn't seen for years. It was so strange, to see these eyes I’ve seen for so long look completely different. He asked me what I wanted to say but nothing came to mind. Later that night I passed the room his parents were sleeping in when I heard them talking. His mother said something about never telling me because I would never be able to understand, and how Gabe knew it was for the best. His niece seemed angry, saying that everyone knew Gabe didn’t want to do it…Do what? I pressed my ear to the door. His dad spoke up saying.

“We just want what's best for Micheal, everyone agreed he had more potential than anyone else.”

Who the fuck is Micheal? I knocked on the door, and his father opened it smiling.

“What’s going on?” I asked concerned.

His mother glanced at her husband before speaking up. “Nothing dear, just head to bed.”

I raised an eyebrow. His mother looked increasingly stressed before Gabe walked up behind me. He asked what was wrong and she just smiled at him. 

“Nothing, we’re just talking…Gabe” His father said a look of frustration washing over his face.

I turned to Gabe who was just looking at his father with disdain.

He looked at his parents and then at me. “Let’s just go back to the room.” He took my hand and pulled me back to our bed. I quickly stood back up and put my hands up frustrated.

“Gabe, why have you been so different, did something happen that no one’s telling me about?”

He looked away before climbing into bed.

“Don’t ignore me, I can’t pretend like you and your family haven't been acting weird, I can’t keep looking the other way!”

He just laid there, not saying a thing. Eventually, I gave up and walked to the bathroom. I put my hair up and got into the shower. Eventually, I heard the door open and close.  I waited for him to say something but he didn’t. I pulled the curtain aside and popped my head out. He was just staring at the mirror, it was foggy so he wiped a circle to see himself. He smiled, then frowned, then went blank, then smiled again. I got freaked out and pulled my head back. I looked at the blue tiles infront of me focusing on any sign of movement, I got impatient and turned the shower off. I reached for my towel wrapping it around me before I opened the curtain to see him still looking into the mirror, He turned to see me before turning around again his eyes wide. I wasn’t even naked. I scoffed a little and stepped out infront of him.

“Look at me.” I said flatly.

He turned to me slowly. He looked like he’d never seen a woman before.

“What is wrong with you?” I asked concerned

He looked at me then at the floor. “I’m sorry.” He said sheepishly.

I looked at him surprised, I didn't even know what to say. 

“I don’t want an apology I want an explanation,” I said softly

He looked me in the eyes, avoiding anything else. “I just…don’t feel like myself.”

He smiled at me weakly. I squinted my eyes a little, I was left unsure by his words. I looked past him and grabbed my toothbrush and he awkwardly grabbed his as well and we stood in silence with nothing but the sounds of our toothbrush filling our ears. Afterward, I walked past him changed, and went right to bed, though I couldn’t really fall asleep, Gabe was up for a while just sitting up in bed in the fetal position. I flipped over in bed looking up at him. I told him to go to bed, he looked down at me and I could see streaks of tears shining in the moonlight. I sat up and tried my best to comfort him, but he wouldn’t talk to me, eventually, he just apologized and laid down. I didn’t want to push him further so I wished him a good night and went to bed as well.

With all this, I haven’t even gotten into the most damning thing, which is what happened this morning. Everyone was sitting in the living room talking, pretending as if everything was normal. Gabe got up to get a drink of water when his sister called out to him a few times and as usual he didn’t turn around, she waved her hand in defeat and turned back around to her family and continued to talk. In their fits of laughter, suddenly I got an idea and stood up and said. “Micheal.” in a low talking tone. He instantly turned around. Everyone went dead silent. He looked me in the eyes. I looked around me and everyone looked like they had just witnessed a murder. His mother stood up and looked at me, Gabriel, and her husband in desperation before she laughed nervously. 

I looked back at Gabriel who was stunned, I couldn’t tell if his eyes reflected fear, relief, or both. His family didn’t talk much after and soon left. I sat in the living room and looked out to the endless forest in front of me. I turned to Gabriel who was making coffee in the kitchen. He walked over to me and passed me a mug We sat in silence for a while. I looked up at him.

“Who’s Micheal?” I asked softly.

He was quiet for a minute before responding quietly. “My twin brother.”

I raised an eyebrow. “I didn’t know you had one.”

“Yeah.” He said stirring his coffee.

I brushed a hand through his hair, which he pulled back a little. I sat down next to him looking out to the snow falling slowly. We didn’t talk about it much after, we put on a movie and spent the rest of the day on the couch. I’m writing this out in my office right now. I don’t know what to think, I’m not much of a supernatural believer, so I don't have much knowledge about it, but this is freaking me the fuck out.",2,1735976088.0,nosleep,0,0.75,False

To begin with I would really like to thank this community for all the information and helpful feedback available, it helped me a lot in my brief coffee journey. I have recently joined the Flair world and I'm absolutely delighted with the taste of the coffee I'm brewing. Coming from N€spr€sso world, I didn't even know that coffee could taste as good as l'm tasting right now. But as I'm starting, I didn't want to invest too much money, so I bought the very inexpensive Flair Neo Flex (2024 edition with pressure gauge). Contrary to the most expensive Flair products it doesn't come with a mirror to control the extraction of your coffee. Having a little spare mirror at home, I used a ball joint 3d model I've found in thingiverse and designed a support that I can print and adhere to my mirror with double sided adhesive tape.

1ht98oh,https://www.reddit.com/r/adultingph/comments/1ht98oh/to_people_who_are_ahead_in_their_career_level/,"To people who are ahead in their career level than their partners, how do you make your relationship work? ","Seeking for mature advice in this Adulting sub. I (F22) am a graduating Financial Management student finishing my internship and building my portfolio. I am two graduation years ahead of my boyfriend (M20), who is a sophomore Engineering student. Tbh we are strong and healthy as a couple, nagkakaroon ng maliliit na away na nareresolve agad kasi open kami in communication and he is very gentle and sweet in handling my mood swings. We are together for 1 year na, and honestly we don't see the two year gap a problem at first.

Not until nagkaroon kami ng tampuhan because I was near his universityfor a internship-related coffee meeting, and inaya ko sya to go out after his class and he refused. I assumed it's because he doesn't wanna see me and tinoyo ako for 2 days. Then he opened up na it's because sakto pera nya that day for his lunch and transpo, kaya nahihiya sya na pag nagkikita kami hindi nya ako malilibre. Ayaw nya daw mag KKB kami or  ilibre ko sya since naniniwala daw sya na responsibility ng guy na magprovide. Then I told him na dapat maging open sya to me about sa pera lalo na I'm older than him and mauuna ako magka stable job so darating talaga sa point na ako ang sasalo ng bill sa dates. And he said na everytime na naiisip nya yon na mauuna akong magka-career nanliliit sya sa sarili nya kasi naalala nya yung opinions ko abt relationships before we dated, and nag-aalala sya sa magiging opinion ng family ko.Nasaktan ako na naiisip nya na pala mga ganong bagay. 

For the context, nung getting to know each other palang kami, we opened up about sa ideal partner and relationship dynamics namin. I opened up na prefer ko na lalaki pa rin ang main financial provider, and secondary provider  lang ako since sa observation ko sa mga cousins ko and family friend na pag girl ang main or sole provider, madalas magulo at toxic dahil parang hindi sila masaya pareho. I opened up na standard ko sa lalaki ang smart, hardworking and successful sa career. Smart si bf (consistent president lister) and hardworking (working student sya before but nag-quit bcs of academic workload and orgs). I told him na since smart and hardworking na sya, and yung pagiging successful sa career ay darating din sa kanya at hihintayin ko yon. Pero tinatanong nya ako abt sa pressure sa family ko. 
Panganay ako and i have 2 younger siblings (shs and jhs) and as expected in a Filipino family magiging breadwinner ako kaya pinagmamadali akong magtrabaho. While my boyfriend is bunso in a family of 7. Their family is financially stable. All of his siblings are already successful and parents have retirement plans and passive income streams. There was no pressure for my boyfriend to work and yung pagiging working student nya before is his own will to gain experience in his field

Nung nalaman ng mom ko recently na I'm 2 years ahead than my boyfriend, nakita kong may disapproval on her part. Initially , my mom likes my boyfriend kasi laging may pasalubong pag bumibisita. But after that, she started lowkey criticizing the things my bf do. I feel like she is becoming less appreciative sa mga pasalubong ni bf and she will start asking if baka daw maging katulad ako ng mga pinsan na sugar mama sa boyfriend or baka ako pala gumagastos sa date kahit naman alam nya na never naging ganon si bf sakin. 

Pakiramdam ko this 2 year graduation gap would possibly be a challenge in our relationship kaya ngayon palang I wanna seek advice on how to make our relationship stand nonetheless. What can I do to remain strong for our relationship, and encourage my boyfriend na there is nothing to be shamed about.  ayaw kong Ilet go si bf sa gantong dahilan kasi malaki ang tiwala ko sa kanya.Alam kong mahal nya ako, and naniniwala akong malayo ang mararating dahil sya na yata pinaka hardworking and resourceful na lalaking nakilala ko ",1,1735975675.0,adultingph,1,0.67,False

I met this girl in one of my classes and we quickly became good friends. She is from LA and she had asked me if I wanted to go to the Americana  mall with her during winter break. When winter break came around, she never brought it up and I didn’t either as I assumed she would since she made the plans. I didn’t think too much of it and just moved on thinking she was busy. When the quarter was over, I never had class with her again but we followed each other on Instagram and occasionally we would dm (I pretty much started the conversation every time) or like each other’s stories/posts (which I would mainly do). Around February, she invited me for coffee out of the blue which I was happy about because we weren’t speaking as much as before. The following day, she invited me for this event that was happening at our school. This event was with a club filled with people I dislike because I got bad vibes from them and I always found their events boring, something I had told her before about. But for the sake of her not going alone, I went with her. A part of me knew she was just inviting me for herself, not bc she necessarily wanted to hang out with me, again didn’t think too much about it. I just decided to go bc I also felt that it would just be a college experience to look back on in the future. She even offered me a ride, which I thought was so sweet and decided to accept after she insisted when I originally said no. The event was okay, we went to a party afterwards which was fun. 


After that event, I started to notice her shifting away from me. We would still talk on IG but it wasn’t the same energy as before. My birthday came up two months after and I invited her which in the end, she said she couldn’t make it for whatever reason. I was a little upset but I understood. I also noticed she had stopped liking my stories, something she was frequently doing up until this event. I then noticed that she went to dinner with some girl from that event, and that’s really where she genuinely started acting different towards me. She never texted me about anything other than wishing me a happy birthday and when I graduated in May, she congratulated me. As for my graduation, I remember she had told me that she wanted to come (this was before winter break when we were closer) which is why I wanted to invite her to my graduation dinner or at least take some photos. When the time came, she came up with another excuse. A part of me was relieved because I genuinely didn’t really want to invite her and only did so bc she brought it up but another part of me was upset bc this was the second time she had rejected my invite when I attended her’s even though I didn’t want to. Mind you, I have also brought up Americana again during the spring break and she said that we should wait till the summer. 


Summer came along, never brought it up. Now she has pretty much completely ignored me. She never likes my stories or comments under my photos. I originally thought this was something she did with everyone but she has been doing that with her new friend from that event, treating her how I would’ve hoped she would’ve treated me in return. She also only dm’s me when I start the conversation. I get that instagram and real life are different but the way she treats me on instagram is the same way she treats me in real life. I wished her a happy birthday, telling her that I miss her and she just said “thank you so much” with an emoji. I also dm’d her for Thanksgiving, saying that I am thankful to have met her (which was stupid of me) and she completely ignored that part. I know for a fact that if it was her new friend saying this, she would’ve responded differently. 


I feel that I have tried to put so much meaningless effort in our friendship and never get anything in return. I didn’t want to believe it was  true, but jealousy has to be the only reason bc I’ve been nothing but a good friend and treat her way more than she deserves. I often get angry at myself for still trying to reach out to her even after treating me like this, but I really need to stop. I have gotten better and have reduced the way I’ve been nice with her but occasionally I still mess up and start being too nice. For Christmas, I decided to see if she’ll message me “Merry Christmas” but she never did. I’m proud of myself for being strong and not falling into this weak trap but it was still painful on her part and it shows that she’s not a real friend at all. 

My question is: “Am I right about her being jealous of me or is it something else?” “Am I overthinking?” This has been driving me a little crazy for a while now and I need to know what it is. I really want to confront her about it but it just shows me as a weaker person. Should I block her or just continue on with treating her the same way she treats me?",3,1735975487.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False

We very slowly got to know each other, he started coming to my cubical to talk. All my co workers were like “I think he likes you!” but I didn't think he did. We get closer and hang out at work all the time for hours and have really deep philosophical talks but also play silly games with each other. We always made a 1 person job a 2 person job, got food together, ran errands, laughed a lot, and texted all day if we weren't together at work. He was also bringing me coffee’s all the time and my co-workers said he would come looking for me looking like a lost puppy when I wasn't there. We started texting more and more but I still had doubts he liked me. 

I leave for christmas holiday and he asks if he can just sit in my cubicle to feel safe when i'm gone and texts me texts me saying he missed me while i'm gone. I finally admit I am starting to like him. I rarely like people so I didn’t really know what to do.

We hang out outside of work but always in a group setting and thats what made me think he didn't like me more than friend. Our co worker always asked questions while i wasnt there and he basically tells her he would ask me out but didn't want to make it weird at work and he's still getting over his ex. I'm frustrated but can't help but still get closer to him.  

We start carpooling to work and make each other coffee’s the way we know each other likes multiple times a week. He starts just driving us to work instead of taking turns like we used to. We are very flirty with sooo much eye contact, we could have convo across the room. All my co-workers, even ones that dont see us very often started asking if we were dating. I finally get so annoyed I bring it up with him and he admits he's scared to date me and he's not ready to be a good partner. I say I understand but i feel like im going insane. 

THREE WEEKS later he goes out with a girl and i find out through a mutual friend. I bring it up with him and he says he doesn't remember saying all those things to me and starts to get very defensive when I bring out the receipts. He eventually kind of apologizes but things are weird between us but I choose to forgive him partially and ask if we can still be friends. We move forwards and a few months later this girl he went out with is now his girlfriend. 

Now they’ve been dating 6 months but things at work are back to how they used to be, we still hang out all the time and text all the time. We still have intense eye contact all the time but it feels so comfortable. He is a good friend and is there whenever i need him, but now we dont text on the weekends or hang out outside of work/check in with each other like we used ot and it hurts so bad. He’s planning on leaving to follow his girlfriend in the summer and I feel like I'm never going to see him again. 

He’s done me so wrong but I still have feelings for him and get so upset and its honestly preventing me from pursuing other people. I don't know how to let it go, I don't even feel like we would work in a relationship but he has so many qualities i was looking for i have never felt so comfortable with a man. 

I've tried to distance myself and suck so bad at it. I know him leaving will probably be good for me but i just want to not have these sad feelings anymore.

I left my mouse on the table and went home(just 2mins drive from the shop) around 5pm yesterday, dropped my bag, and then went out again. Came back at 11pm, took my laptop out from the bag, but couldn't find the mouse anywhere (I even searched my bike).

Today I went to that shop again to see if they find my mouse, nothing, and they don't have CCTV on the 2nd floor. I am pretty sure the staffs didn't take my mouse, so it might be taken by some other guests in the shop yesterday.

But come on, here is Thao Dien, most of the guests are expats/foreigners and normal local people, was one of them really that poor? My mouse was just a cheap Logitech wireless mouse, why didn't they just give it to the staffs? ",0,1735975415.0,VietNam,11,0.22,False

1ht95vd,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1ht95vd/angelface/,Angelface,"In conclusion, the problem and solution both end with my name.

It reads:  
""Child, I'm sorry you were.""
""Signed, God."" Probably.  

A stagnant father,  
deafened by mother.  
A replacement for his melting witch  
helps him feel so much stronger.  

They bring nothing but grimaces,  
a plate of sedatives,  
trying not to look upon me as a carcass.
But I am the furthest thing from still.  

When he dies,  
where will she be?  
Home to her new children?  

When his blue eyes lose the red behind them,  
when his blank stare isn’t pity but dead indifference—
where will I be?  

Home to my family?  
Home to my stained carpets and sticky walls?  
Would I prefer the cell?  
Concrete or cotton?  

What are the carpets made of?  
Do I really want them gone?  
They smell of roses,  
fertilized by the putridity of death’s home.  

The bodies beneath them give birth to rotten beauty.  
I dig my heel into the thorn  
until I am painted by the beautiful red petals.  
My faith is fulfilled.  

---  

Who will thank me when I take myself?  
Who will wonder  
what lies behind my dead eyes?  

And the stains on the floor of my bedroom—  
the ones I can’t remember,  
the ones I can’t deny.  

Who will feel guilty for my lies  
when I’m doing nothing but lying?  
In soil?  
Through my rotting teeth?  

When the yellow stains erode from my bones,  
when the scars on my flesh are eaten by the earth—  
why would anyone look for me?  

What am I, if not my stains and scars?  
I am a slate of sheer bone and sockets.  
Nothing broken,  
but all of it empty.  

Taken to a place  
that might love it  
like I never did.  

---  

Dying now.  
What difference?  
How family?  
How love?  

How does it continue to defile me—  
sickly?  
Sweetly?  

The angelface he sees,  
the ghost of my past I find reflected in his eyes.  
He layers it upon my rotting potential  
like a projector upon a crumbling wall.  

I am pulp by comparison.  

Could she really do this much?  
Could I still love her if she did?  
Never her, always she.

Always the hunt for the weak bend of my neck.  
The drop of blood—  
under my eye, across my cheekbone.  

It wasn’t mine.  

She is my blood,  
done damage only a mother could.  
If her blood stains my face,  
it can’t run cleanly through my veins.  

My vessels will never see  
anything but the blue of her mania,  
the red of the tears she left in me.
A memorable legacy,
if ever there was

---  

Thank you for your spite,  
spirit,  
spit,  
spice—  
the spider queen.  

You destroyed yourself,  
inspired me to do the same.  
Loathed me  
when you saw yourself staring back.  

But what was left of your brain  
when I decided to replicate it?  
When but an eroded shell  
saw itself in me?  

Waiting to die?  
The intoxication destroyed You.  
There was nothing left in Your Eyes 
when I left You,  
and there will never be anything again. 

They beat you to your grave;  
they await you beneath forgotten soil, 
severed and forsaken.  

The light went out when you saw yourself,  
saw what you had become.  
It won’t come back  
because you never take a second glance.  

---  

Where did the family go?  
Is the stain coffee or blood?  

She always needed someone to hit.  
I don’t blame her.  
I don’t blame anyone for anything.  

Live eye to live eye.  
Stain sees stain.  
Fair trade and unrecoverable loss.  

Fortune tells me not.  

Assist me, Hunger.  
Tell me I can,  
for I wish her dead  
as strongly as you do.  

I starve for her.  
And she kills me,  
tiredly.

 so im 19 and ive wanted to move out for sooo long im just very independent and want freedom. my home life has always been really weird it wasn't  until a couple years ago i was allowed to sleep in my own room and still she gets upset when i go to my room at all unless its for bed shell get sad and say i never spend time with her (im constantly in the living room with her) and that i must hate her. if i ever go out she calls be about 12 every time with some excuse for me to come home its like a non specified cerfew and its always a lie that she knows will get me home like my cat ran away.

 my moms so codependent on me she wont really eat or sleep if im not home to make her food and i help pay bills and i get groceries do most of the cooking and cleaning  and buying of most of the nessities and her wants so i waste alot of money with her. she wastes her extra money on coffee  and cigarettes every  day so she couldn't afford to live without me. 

i know its a backbone issue and over the years ive gotten soo much better at telling her no and standing up for myself  but i really  want to move out and i know that will really upset her and possibly put her in a bad financial position. i feel like it would help me grow and save more money and make me happier. less fighting and manipulation and feeling like a live in maid. 

my boyfriend offered  for me to move in with his family. i want to do it as soon as possible, so probably next month. I could bring my cats and snake. I'd have my own room and living room and my own bathroom to share with him. Wed have most of the basement to ourselves.
 I've known him and his family for about 4 years, and i spend most of my time there anyway.

 My boyfriend is very loving and really  enjoys taking care of me we make a great team in everything we do together  hes my best friend and other half so i think it will go well plus it would give us an idea on how well we work together  when we are sharing a space for a longer period of time.

 i just dont know how to even begin to tell my mom or if i even should. either way ill have to deal with guilt trips and crying. and idk if im a bad person for wanting  to leave when she needs my help im just so tierd of helping i want teamwork and equality which my boyfriend also yearns for. what do you guys recommend i do?",1,1735975128.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
1ht92qy,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1ht92qy/the_best_furniture_for_small_spaces_maximize/,The Best Furniture for Small Spaces: Maximize Every Inch,"When living in a compact home, every piece of furniture must pull double duty, combining functionality with style. Selecting the right pieces from a trusted [home furniture shop](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/) can transform even the tiniest space into a stylish and efficient haven. Whether you’re furnishing a studio apartment or adding functionality to a smaller room, here’s your guide to choosing the best [house furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/) to maximize every inch without compromising on design.

# 1. Multifunctional Furniture: The Small-Space Hero

In a small home, versatility is key. Invest in furniture that serves more than one purpose, such as ottomans with hidden storage or foldable dining tables that expand when needed.

* Stylish Side Table with Storage: A [stylish side table](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/side-tables) that doubles as storage is a small-space essential. Use it to tuck away magazines, remotes, or other essentials while keeping your living area clutter-free.
* Convertible Sofas: Opt for a sofa that can transform into a bed for guests, saving you from needing a dedicated guest room.

# 2. Choose Compact and Sleek Pieces

Bulky furniture can overwhelm small spaces. Instead, opt for sleek, compact designs that fit proportionally within the room.

* Metal Coffee Table: A [metal coffee table](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/coffee-tables) with a minimalist design can add a touch of modern sophistication while taking up less visual space. Choose one with an open base to maintain an airy feel in the room.
* Wall-Mounted Shelves: These free up floor space and provide ample storage for books, decor, and more.

# 3. Furniture That Makes Use of Vertical Space

When floor space is limited, think vertically. Tall bookcases, wall-mounted desks, or cabinets that reach toward the ceiling make excellent use of available space.

Pro Tip: Consider modular furniture from a reputable house furniture retailer. These pieces are designed to fit snugly into tight spaces while providing maximum storage.

# 4. Foldable and Stackable Furniture

Foldable and stackable furniture pieces are lifesavers in compact homes. Folding chairs, extendable dining tables, and nesting tables can be used when needed and stored away to free up space.

* Stylish Side Tables: Nesting side tables are perfect for entertaining. Use them as extra surfaces for drinks or snacks and tuck them away afterward.
* Folding Dining Tables: Perfect for small kitchens or dining rooms, these tables expand for larger meals and contract when not in use.

# 5. Mirrored and Transparent Furniture

Mirrors and transparent furniture create the illusion of more space.

* Acrylic or Glass Side Tables: These are functional and nearly invisible, making the room feel larger and less crowded.
* Mirrored Cabinets: A mirrored piece from a home furniture shop can add both storage and a reflective surface to brighten and visually expand the room.

# 6. Compact Dining and Workspaces

If your dining or work area needs to share space with other functions, choose compact, dual-purpose pieces.

* Wall-Mounted Drop-Leaf Tables: These are perfect for dining or working, folding away completely when not in use.
* Compact Desk Options: A slim desk that doubles as a console table can create a functional workspace without overwhelming the room.

# 7. Storage-Savvy Solutions

Storage is always a concern in smaller spaces, but smart furniture choices can help.

* Under-Bed Storage: Invest in beds with built-in drawers to maximize hidden storage.
* Storage Ottomans: These can serve as extra seating or a footrest while holding blankets, books, or other items.

# Why Shop at a Trusted Home Furniture Shop?

When designing a compact home, selecting high-quality, well-designed pieces is crucial. A reliable home furniture shop offers curated options specifically tailored to small spaces, from multifunctional pieces to stylish designs like metal coffee tables and stylish side tables. Whether you're looking to furnish a modern apartment or add functional elements to your home, the right store can provide expert advice and high-quality furniture to suit your needs.

# Final Thoughts

Furnishing a small space is an art that balances practicality and style. By choosing versatile, sleek, and storage-friendly house furniture, you can make every inch of your home functional and beautiful. Whether you're browsing for a metal coffee table, a stylish side table, or multifunctional furniture, start with a trusted home furniture shop to find pieces that suit your space and reflect your personality.

Small spaces don’t have to feel cramped. With the right furniture, they can feel cozy, inviting, and entirely your own.",1,1735974975.0,u_homeandsoul,0,1.0,False
1ht91wh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1ht91wh/advice_on_pursuit/,Advice on pursuit,"I (F20) may have scared off a guy I like by being too forward in front of his friends.
I met this Christian guy (M22) through our campus ministry during my first semester of college. He's a sophomore, I'm a freshman, and we're in the same major. I was drawn to his humor and personality, and we'd talked a few times about classes and ministry, mostly in groups. I planned to ask him out for coffee next semester after spending time together at a 4-day conference.

At the conference, things started great. The first night, we hung out with another couple from our school, and he was friendly, even mentioning he felt ready for his ""woman of God."" The next day, I walked past him I touched his shoulder as I said hi and that I would see him later, being more forward. He responded positvely at the moment but later that day he got more distant. Giving short answers when I asked about mission trips that we were learning about but he was not really looking at me and abrubtly walked away from the convo. 

On the last day, I complimented his shirt in front of his guy friends, and later, when I asked if he'd dress up for the NYE party, he dryly said, ""Plans changed."" At the party, he danced more with his friends (and even other girls) than with me. Which was crazy because I never noticed him approach other girls unless they were in a group or joined in the convo! Even when we were jokingly dancing, he barely made eye contact or matched my energy. He interacted normally with others, dancing with the back and matching their energy. I haven't seen or reached out to him since.

Did I come on too strong, and how can I fix this? I really like him and want to get to know him better.

1ht8vyn,https://www.reddit.com/r/RoleplayPartnerSearch/comments/1ht8vyn/m4a_seeking_a_wholesome_romance/,[M4A] Seeking A Wholesome Romance ,"
Hi there! I’m looking for a writing partner to collaborate on a heartwarming, slow-burn romance between two new neighbors. This will be a simple, feel-good story with a focus on personal connection, quiet moments, and the kind of chemistry that builds over time.  

### The Concept  
The story revolves around two people who find themselves as next-door neighbors in a quiet suburban neighborhood. While their lives are different, they gradually form a bond through small encounters, thoughtful gestures, and shared moments.  

Here’s the basic setup:  
- **The Male Neighbor:** A few years younger, he’s recently moved in and is adjusting to life in a new place. Whether he’s a young professional, a freelancer, or starting over after a life change, he’s friendly, genuine, and a little unsure of how to fit into this new setting.  
- **The Female Neighbor:** A kind and approachable woman who’s lived here longer or moved in around the same time. She’s independent, has a warm heart, and is always willing to lend a helping hand when needed.  

Their age difference will be present but subtle, serving as just one detail of their dynamic rather than the focus of the story.  

### Themes and Story Ideas  
This story will center on:  
- The beauty of small, meaningful interactions—like morning chats over coffee, helping with groceries, or tending to a shared garden.  
- Learning about each other’s pasts, dreams, and insecurities as their connection deepens.  
- Moments of quiet humor, vulnerability, and the occasional spark of romantic tension.  

The tone will be warm, optimistic, and heartfelt, with an emphasis on creating a cozy, realistic romance.  

### My Writing Preferences  
I’m looking for **novella-style roleplay** with thoughtful, detailed responses. Replies should be **3-5 paragraphs long**, and the focus will be on character development and emotional growth rather than anything physical.  

### How to Reach Out  
If this sounds like a story you’d enjoy, please send me a DM with:  
1. Your **literacy level**  
2. The **role** you’d like to play  
3. Your **age** (for comfort and compatibility)  
4. Any **ideas** or adjustments you’d like to suggest for the story  

Let’s bring this charming romance to life together!


**I am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+**

1ht8uuf,https://v.redd.it/ay3q6784exae1,Hibrew G4B Review,"So, I recently received the hand grinder from fix coffee India to review, the grinder feels really premium in finish and has a 38mm Concial Burr set along with external grind size adjustment. 
Things I like: 
-The external grind size adjustment
-Ease of zero Calibration post cleaning
-The additional rubber wrap to give that extra grip while grinding
-No wobble in the shaft

Things which I did not like too much:
-The grind size adjustment click difference it’s a huge difference of 33 microns in each click.
-They specify it grinds espresso but only will work with pressurized baskets as it cannot grind fine enough for creating resistance in non pressurized baskets
-Even after zero calibration if the grinder is moving freely on a spin then I think the burrs are not actually touching and it’s not the true zero.

My verdict it’s good for pourovers and manual brews but espresso won’t recommend it! 

Overall a good feel, good grip and consistent grinds for manual brews! ",12,1735974061.0,IndiaCoffee,4,0.93,False

1ht8se6,https://www.reddit.com/r/NightOwls/comments/1ht8se6/is_it_weird_to_just_walk_around_the_casino_at/,Is it weird to just… walk around the casino at night?,"Lately, I’ve just been following my body’s natural wakefulness/sleepiness flow. I’ve always been nocturnal, and wouldn’t be surprised if I had DSPD. I’m an unemployed online student with basically no schedule, so there’s really been no use in forcing myself to sleep and wake during hours that don’t feel right for my body. 

While it’s been nice to not have to worry about getting enough sleep, I’ve been feeling very bored and restless at night. Like, right now, it’s almost 2am, and I reeeaallly want to get out of the house. However….. night walks are out of the question, as I live in a shady area, I’m a girl, and it’s cold. 24 hour gyms, diners, and Walmarts are non-existent now. The only place open at this hour is the casino.

Honestly, sometimes I think about driving over to the casino at night, just to walk around, maybe grab a coffee or a snack, and just people watch and look at the lights. Maybe even sit in one of the food courts and doodle in my sketchbook or get some studying done. I don’t like gambling; I just feel like if I’m going to be up, I want to at least go *somewhere* and do *something* instead of just rotting away in my room. I guess social anxiety has me convinced that going there to just chill and walk around would be weird, or look shady.

I also worked there in one of the food court restaurants for a couple of years, so there’s also that vague fear of seeing an old coworker or smth.

Idk y’all, would it be a weird thing to do? Should I follow my whims, or just stay home? I’m overthinking this, yeah?",5,1735973804.0,NightOwls,5,1.0,False
1ht8s5i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1ht8s5i/a_bad_date_experience_with_a_foreign_guy/,A bad date experience with a foreign guy,"I recently had a disappointing dating experience that I need to share. I installed the dating app Badoo and matched with an American man. We exchanged numbers and began communicating via WhatsApp. He mentioned that he was in my city, so we decided to meet.

**First Meeting:**

We met shortly after Christmas and walked around the park for about an hour before entering a coffee shop. During our conversation, he avoided making eye contact, which felt odd to me. However, I dismissed it, thinking it was too early to judge. The meeting was pleasant; we spent time in the coffee shop getting to know each other.

**Second Meeting:**

We continued texting and decided to meet again on New Year's Day. We met at a mall and walked around for hours. When I asked why we were walking in circles, he said it was to burn calories. I found this strange but chose not to overthink it. During our walk, I mentioned his profession, and he suddenly asked about my school, indicating he hadn't remembered even the smallest details about me. This was disappointing, but I let it slide.

After hours of walking, he suggested getting drinks at Thirsty and bought one for me. By this time, I was very hungry and expected him to suggest we eat, especially since it was dinner time, but he didn't. I was unsure how to bring it up, as this was only my second date, and I wasn't familiar with dating etiquette. I let it go, but he became increasingly touchy, giving me kisses on the cheek that led to a kiss on the lips. I didn't mind, as it was my first kiss, and I liked it.

Around 8 PM, he abruptly said it was time to go home. I felt disappointed because I had expected a dinner date. I wouldn't have minded paying for my own food, but I expected him to at least ask. I went home feeling self-pity and disappointment, believing I deserved to be treated better. I never ask for money or take advantage of anyone.

**The Revelation:**

Later that night, he messaged me. I expressed my disappointment about him not asking if I wanted to eat and forgetting important details about me. He explained, and I thought, ""Okay."" He asked to meet again, and while I had second thoughts, I wanted to give him a second chance. To ease my mind, I asked if he could send me an identification card bearing his name, and I would do the same. I sent mine, but out of nowhere, he apologized and confessed that he had been lying to me about his name and profession. He had claimed to be a lawyer and landowner, but that wasn't true.

I was shocked and couldn't help but cry because I felt so betrayed. He said he did it because, in America, women didn't pay attention to him, but in the Philippines, he received a lot of attention, especially with a fake profile. He admitted to feeling insecure. I don't care about someone's profession, but why did he have to deceive me? It's painful to be deceived when you have no bad intentions. Perhaps dating isn't for me, and maybe dating foreigners isn't either. I'm very disappointed. I'm just glad he confessed before I became emotionally attached, or this situation would have been even more hurtful.

**Lessons Learned:**

I realized that dating insecure and dishonest individuals leads to disappointment. As a woman, it's important to have the means to pay for your own expenses on a date. Next time, if I date again, I need to be more vocal about my expectations.

I won't share this with my friends because I'm too embarrassed. Writing it here is my way of coping. Thank you for reading. ",5,1735973777.0,Vent,0,1.0,False

1ht8q5e,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1ht8q5e/small_changes_big_impact_quick_home_decor/,"Small Changes, Big Impact: Quick Home Decor Upgrades for Any Budget","Transforming your home doesn’t always require a major overhaul. Sometimes, the smallest changes can make the biggest impact, giving your space a refreshed look without straining your wallet. Whether you’re a fan of modern home decor or love the charm of [boho decor](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor/decorations), these quick and budget-friendly ideas will help you upgrade your interiors effortlessly.

# 1. Add Texture with Rattan Accents

A simple yet effective way to breathe life into your home is by incorporating natural elements. A [rattan basket](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/decoration/baskets) is a versatile piece that can be used for storage, as a planter, or even as a decorative accent. Its earthy tones and textured look add warmth, making it perfect for [natural home decoration](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/).

**Quick Tip:** Place a large rattan basket in your living room to hold blankets or magazines, or use smaller ones in the bathroom to organize toiletries.

# 2. Layer Your Textiles

Layering textiles is a key trend in both boho decor and [modern home decor](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/decoration). Swap out your old throw pillows and blankets for ones with interesting patterns, textures, or colors. For a bohemian vibe, mix and match pillows with tribal prints, tassels, and earthy tones. For a modern look, opt for sleek, minimalist designs with bold colors or geometric patterns.

**Budget-Friendly Upgrade:** Update your rugs or add a smaller throw rug to create visual interest and comfort.

# 3. Upgrade Your Wall Art

Walls are often overlooked, but changing what’s on them can make a world of difference. Replace outdated art pieces with new ones that match your style. For a natural touch, consider botanical prints, framed dried flowers, or woven wall hangings.

**Pro Tip:** Wall shelves are an excellent way to display a mix of small art pieces, plants, and rattan basket decor, blending functionality with aesthetics.

# 4. Incorporate Greenery

Adding plants to your space is one of the easiest ways to make it feel vibrant and alive. Indoor plants not only purify the air but also enhance natural home decoration. Pair plants with unique planters, such as ceramic pots or woven rattan baskets, to complement your decor style.

**Low-Maintenance Options:** Snake plants, pothos, and succulents are perfect for those with less-than-green thumbs.

# 5. Revamp Your Lighting

Lighting can transform the mood of a room instantly. Replace standard light fixtures with something more decorative, like pendant lights, or use string lights to add a cozy ambiance. For a boho decor vibe, try lamps with textured shades or lanterns made of natural materials like bamboo or rattan.

**Quick Fix:** Swap out old lampshades for ones in neutral tones or woven designs to create a softer, more natural glow.

# 6. Rearrange Your Furniture

Sometimes, the biggest impact comes from zero-cost changes. Rearrange your furniture to improve the flow of your space. Focus on creating cozy corners by pairing a chair with a side table and a rattan basket filled with books or blankets.

**Small Touch:** Add a mirror to reflect light and make your room appear larger and brighter.

# 7. Swap Out Hardware

An often-overlooked upgrade is replacing cabinet knobs, drawer pulls, and doorknobs. Choose materials that align with your decor style, such as sleek metals for modern home decor or aged brass and ceramic for a more rustic, bohemian feel.

# 8. Introduce Boho Decor Accents

To achieve a laid-back yet stylish vibe, introduce boho decor elements like macramé wall hangings, tasseled throws, or patterned floor cushions. These small additions can instantly add character and charm to any room.

**Styling Idea:** Pair boho accents with natural home decoration items like wooden bowls or rattan trays for a cohesive look.

# 9. Declutter and Curate

A clutter-free home feels instantly more inviting. Take time to declutter and focus on displaying only items that truly bring you joy. Use rattan baskets or storage boxes to organize items while keeping them accessible.

**Design Tip:** Create vignettes on surfaces like coffee tables or consoles using a mix of books, candles, and small decor items.

# 10. Refresh with Paint or Wallpaper

A fresh coat of paint or peel-and-stick wallpaper can dramatically change a room’s appearance. Choose colors that complement your decor style: neutral tones for a natural aesthetic or bold hues for a modern, striking look.

**Budget-Friendly Option:** Paint just one wall for a feature wall effect or use wallpaper on the back of shelves for a subtle yet impactful upgrade.

# Final Thoughts

With a mix of creativity and a few well-chosen pieces, you can transform your home without breaking the bank. Whether you lean towards the earthy charm of boho decor, the sleek lines of modern home decor, or love incorporating natural home decoration elements like a rattan basket, these quick upgrades are sure to make a big impact.

I’ve always been curious about diving into water chemistry for coffee, and maybe doing my own water recipe pero mejo naooverwhelm ako sa dami ng info 😆 

So I decided to start with pre-mixed packets muna. I recently got Alon ng Kape specialty water, and using Absolute Distilled Water to mix it, I did a side-by-side comparison with the regular mineral water I get from my refilling station. The difference was immediately noticeable.

The mix really brought out the acidity in my coffee, making it more vibrant and pronounced. I also noticed the texture of the brew felt smoother, almost silky(?) compared to my usual mineral water. 
It’s subtle but definitely there! 

I’m really looking forward to testing it out with other coffees to see how it affects different profiles.

Has anyone here tried Alon ng Kape and compared it with other pre-mixed options like Third Wave Water or Aquacode? I’d love to hear your thoughts or observations!",7,1735973532.0,CoffeePH,6,1.0,False

1ht8otf,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ht8otf/i_learned_the_hard_way_to_never_expect_for_a/,I Learned the Hard Way to Never Expect for a Perfect Partner,"As a wife, I often engaged in casual conversations with my friends, who were also wives, about the ups and downs of married life.

It wasn't solely positive or negative; every aspect had its own blend of good and bad. However, sharing the less favorable aspects of marriage with my fellow wife helped maintain the strength of my own marriage while relieving stress from my mind.

At one point, I confided in my best friend Amelia about my husband Randy.

Over the course of our four-year marriage, he had undergone significant positive changes, for which I should have been grateful. Yet, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss.

""What? Your husband has become more romantic, sweeter, and more attentive, and you suspect him because of that? Many women would desire such qualities in their husbands, in case you didn't notice,"" Amelia responded, with a hint of humor in her voice.

""Or... could it be that you suspect his change in behavior is because he's hiding something, like an affair?"" she whispered to me.

""No, no. I mean, I did suspect that at one point, but there were no signs of anything like that,"" I replied, sipping my coffee. ""That's not what I meant.""

""I mean, physically, he looked the same down to the smallest details: the birthmark, the scars from his college days, even the way he spoke. But deep down, I felt like he wasn't the man I married five years ago,"" I explained.

""How so?"" Amelia asked. ""I don't know, Ames. I just feel it.""

""When did you start feeling this way?"" she inquired again.

I paused for a moment, gazing at the ceiling of my house, trying to recollect my memories.

""About three years ago,"" I responded.

It was true. Three years ago, I sensed something different about him. He seemed slightly uncomfortable, as if he wasn't accustomed to certain things he used to be experienced with. However, as time went by, things appeared to return to normal. Nothing else struck me as peculiar, aside from the occasional uneasy feeling.

I did try to confront him about his apparent change, which resulted in a heated argument. However, none of our arguments provided evidence to support my suspicions. Perhaps I was overreacting, but I asked him about our shared moments, even the smallest details that only we knew.

Surprisingly, he answered everything flawlessly.

Despite his successful efforts to prove himself, I still felt uneasy. With each passing day, my uneasiness grew stronger, fueling my thoughts.

Apart from my uneasy gut feeling, he transformed into an ideal spouse rather than the opposite.

You could call me ungrateful or anything, but as much as I wished for a perfect partner, I have come this far to realize that there is no such thing as a perfect partner.

Then, one fateful day, I received the answer I dreaded.

It was early morning when my husband left for the office, and I bid him farewell with a kiss at the door. A few hours later, there was an abrupt knock on my door, followed by police officers presenting a search warrant for my house.

""What? What is this about? I haven't done anything,"" I exclaimed frantically.

""We are looking for your husband,"" the detective informed me. ""But he's still at the office,"" I responded, my heart racing at the detective's unsettling reply.

""No, not that one,"" the detective clarified.

‘Not that one?’ What the hell is that supposed to mean??

They instructed me to sit and wait on the couch while they combed through the house. Horror struck me when I witnessed some of the officers emerging from the basement, carrying a body bag in their hands.

""Wait, what? A body bag? Is there a dead body in the house? Who is it?"" I stammered in panic and horror.

""We have confirmed it. It's your husband,"" the detective announced.

I was shocked. It felt like my heart had stopped for a brief moment.

""No, that can't be. He's still at the office. I saw it with my own eyes when he left the house and got into his car earlier this morning,"" I pleaded once again with the detective.

The detective beckoned me closer. ""He was well-preserved, due to mummification, so it's safe for you to see and verify,"" the detective explained as he unzipped the body bag, revealing the lifeless face of Randy, my husband.

""Have you ever felt that something was off about your husband lately?"" the detective asked me when I finally managed to gather myself.

""Well, to be honest, yes. But whenever I confronted him with personal questions, he always had the right answers,"" I explained.

""He was an expert. It seems he diligently followed your every move before deciding to assume your husband's identity. He studied your husband's scars, learned to mimic his speech and gait—everything. This man is a deranged stalker. It's nearly impossible to distinguish the two apart, except for your intuition,"" the detective revealed.

I sank back onto the couch, burying my face in my hands. I had no idea how to react or what steps to take next.

""I wonder how long he has been impersonating my husband,"" I mumbled.

""Based on our medical examiner's findings and our investigation, we can roughly estimate the duration,"" the detective informed me, pausing for a moment.

""I'm sorry, ma'am, but did you perhaps live with your husband before you got married?"" he asked politely, sitting next to me on the couch.

""No,"" I replied. ""I moved in with him after we got married.""

""Regarding the questions you asked during your confrontation, when did the events related to those questions occur?"" the detective inquired.

I stared at the detective, consumed by disappointment and anger at myself. I was certain my face turned crimson with embarrassment.

""Oh... dear God..."" I murmured as I forcefully slapped my own face with both hands.

""Ma'am?"" the detective tried to console me.

""Three years..."" I responded. ""It all started three years ago with those events. No wonder...""

Suddenly, the detective reached into his pocket and pulled out a vibrating cell phone.

""Yes, Detective Roberts speaking,"" he answered the call. After listening for a moment, he ended the call with disappointment evident in his face and voice.

""Great,"" he muttered.

""What is it?"" I asked.

""The other half of my team was rushing to your husband's office at the same time I rushed here. We were attempting to apprehend him,"" he explained. ""My team just reported that he isn't in the office. It appears we were too late,"" he continued.

""Only God knows where he'll be and who he'll transform into next.""",2,1735973403.0,nosleep,0,0.67,False

Since I WFH, my day to day social interactions can be pretty limited. Lately, I've been feeling the need for some more consistent connections - people to chat and pass the work days with, and occasionally hang out in person. I don't just want penpals but I love having friends who have time to chat as well! 

I'm into dancing (various styles), my dog, crafts, gaming (xbox, switch, PC - currently playing Far Cry 6, Slime Rancher 2 and ToTK), strength training, animals, lego modulars, grabbing a coffee/brunch, personal growth, archery, geocaching and generally just casual hangs. 

I'm really looking for friends who don't frequently ghost for weeks on end. I get everyone has things going on, and I respect the need for space and gaps in communication (seriously we don't need to talk every day), but I'm getting too old for unbalanced friendships 😊

Get in touch!

Edit: I am very happily engaged so not looking for hookups. I would prefer to meet other women, but I'm open to male friendships (the odds aren't great though). Couples would be amazing too!

Edit 2: If you don't live in Brisbane you're wasting your time messaging me, there's zero chance I'll respond.",2,1735972777.0,BrisbaneSocial,1,0.67,False

I’m looking for recommendations for a men’s haircut where the hairstylist can suggest and execute a different style or a makeover, instead of just maintaining the current look.

I recently went to Walking on Sunshine after seeing recommendations on Reddit, but unfortunately, it didn’t work out. I booked a senior stylist (J), hoping for a fresh new style. However, she told me my hair “looks good for now” and suggested I just trim it short to maintain it. I told her I hate my current outlook because it makes me look too old, but she insisted it was “good.”

I left feeling disappointed—$60+ spent, and all I got was a free coffee and a good hair wash. :(

I really want a stylist who listens to what I want and is willing to help me experiment with a new look. If you know of any good salons or stylists in Singapore who are great at giving makeovers for men, please share!

Thanks in advance!",1,1735972775.0,askSingapore,1,1.0,False

Let’s break it down and get straight to the answers.

# How Much Can You Earn with Google AdSense?

Earnings from Google AdSense are all over the map, but here’s the range: **$0.20 to $2.50 per 1,000 views**.

Sounds low?

Well, it gets better if you’re in a lucrative niche. For example:

* Sites in **finance or tech** often earn $2–$4 per 1,000 views.
* Got traffic from the U.S., Canada, or Europe? Expect higher payouts because advertisers bid more for these audiences.

**Ad Placement and Engagement Matter**

* Ads buried at the bottom of your page? Say goodbye to clicks.
* High click-through rates (CTR)? Your earnings rise fast.

# Why Selling Products Can Be a Game Changer

Let’s compare.

With AdSense, you’re making coffee money. Selling products? You could earn **$300 per 1,000 views** or more.

Here’s why:

1. **You control the price**. A $50 product with a 1% conversion rate (10 sales per 1,000 views) = $500 in revenue.
2. **Zero middleman cut**. AdSense takes a slice; selling products puts more profit in your pocket.
3. **Niche Power**. If your content aligns with your product, visitors are already primed to buy.

**Example:** Someone running a fitness site might sell:

* Workout guides
* Supplements
* Fitness gear

Even if only 1 in 100 buys, the earnings stomp all over AdSense.

# The Sweet Spot: Combine Ads with Products

Why pick one when you can do both?

Stacking Google AdSense with your products can maximize your revenue potential. 

Here’s the play:

1. **Use AdSense as background income.** Ads fill space and make passive cash.
2. **Sell products through funnels.** Tools like **ClickFunnels** guide visitors to a purchase like magic.

**How to Set This Up:**

* Run display ads to earn passive income.
* Add product banners to highlight your offerings.
* Use a funnel to capture leads and upsell.

**The Result?**

Diversified income streams that balance steady ad revenue with product sales’ high margins.

# Real Numbers from Real Users

Here’s what people are saying about earnings:

* **$10 to $30 per 1,000 views** is typical for AdSense in competitive niches.
* Selling products directly? Earnings skyrocket to **$300 or more per 1,000 views** if your product is dialed in.

One Reddit user shared how they shifted focus to product sales after realizing their time spent optimizing AdSense wasn’t yielding enough returns. 

With products, the payoff was immediate.

# Final Thoughts: What’s the Best Move?

If you’re just starting out, AdSense can bring in consistent, low-effort cash. 

But the real money is in selling products.

**Here’s the game plan:**

* Start with AdSense to get familiar with monetization.
* Add products once you’ve got steady traffic.
* Use tools like ClickFunnels to boost conversions.

Remember: **more streams = more stability.** 

Don’t rely on just ads or just products. Combine them, and let your website work smarter, not harder.",1,1735972569.0,cliobra,0,1.0,False

1ht8emh,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsReadOfficial/comments/1ht8emh/antartica/,Antartica,"Have you ever felt like everything you do and think is somehow pre-programmed? Like it's all been decided for you? Well, I think my friend might have stumbled upon some evidence of that. 

A few days ago, I got a file from a journalist friend of mine who teaches at a private university in Montevideo. I've known her for years, and our countless nights out chatting over drinks really inspired me to dive into journalism myself. Once I started my career, we grew even closer and often discussed our worries about how information is changing, the impact of social media, and the strange numbness we've developed to cope with it all.

Let’s call her Valeria. She entered a state scholarship to join a small scientific expedition to the Uruguayan Antarctic base. Her thesis focused on how people receive information in remote and isolated areas. I skimmed through it, but the gist is that she aimed to show how information flows differently among unfamiliar groups living under extreme weather and isolation, like life on submarines or military bases in Siberia, and this Antarctica trip gave her a chance to see those ideas play out firsthand.

In the end, she was selected for the trip and flew with the research team from Montevideo to Santiago de Chile therefore heading off to Punta Arenas and finally flying down to the Antarctic base.

The last thing I heard from her, before she sent me the nearly 90 photos of the Journal, was on March 15, 2024. 

We had a phone chat about the weather in Montevideo. It just won’t stop raining, and cars are nearly floating down the streets. She mentioned that their transport back was having some mechanical issues, and they might have to order parts for the plane all the way from Punta Arenas. Then she went on about how freezing it is there and how her colleagues are pretty lame. Apparently, no one has any whisky for the evenings. We both chuckled at that because I suggested she should sneak a bottle of Grappa in her purse.

Before we hung up, she told me they’d found some old metal structures south of the base. The soldiers assured her it was safe to check them out, so she planned to explore. Those structures weren’t there when they first arrived; apparently, this unusual heat wave must have uncovered them. I reminded her to be careful before we said our goodbyes.

Three days later, I got an email saying “Valeria shared a file with you” Just as I started checking it out, my phone rang, she was calling me. 

—Mauro? MAURO! Can you hear me?-Her voice was a mix of nerves and excitement.

—I can barely hear you! What’s going on?-I asked, still half-asleep and lying in bed.

—Listen carefully—don’t talk, just listen.

I could tell she was really agitated; she sounded like she was either walking quickly or maybe even running. In the background, I could hear her footsteps crunching in the snow and a distant siren blaring like something out of a disaster movie.

—Are you okay? What’s going on? What’s that noise?- I asked, sitting on the edge of my bed.  

—I sent you a file. You need to transfer it to a flash drive, delete your browser history, and reset your phone, computer, and email. I’ll explain everything later; trust me, it’ll be worth it. 

—What? Val, what are you talking about? Why? Just tell me what’s happening!-I shouted, feeling a wave of panic wash over me.  

—Listen carefully—I found something that shouldn’t exist. It’s all in the diary. I’m heading back to base; I think someone might be following me or I triggered an alarm or something. Just hold onto that file for me until I get there and remember… 

Suddenly, there were two loud bangs followed by the sound of water flooding through the call. A choked bubbling and cracking noise echoed like ice breaking apart. My friend had fallen into the water, in the fucking south pole.

—¡HEY! Are you alright?! What happened?!-I yelled frantically until the call dropped.

I stared at my phone for a moment, hands trembling as I tried calling her again, but it was dead. Glancing at the compressed file made my heart race; I jumped up and dashed to the dining room furniture, rifling through drawers for a white flash drive that had to be around somewhere. No luck there, so I rushed back to my desk. In my haste, I yanked open a drawer so hard it came off its track and crashed to the floor. There I was—digging through coins, papers, cards—nothing! Frustration hit me as I struggled to recall where in the world I'd put that damn thing.

Finally, I spotted my backpack peeking out from behind the desk chair. I dove for it and found a cheap white 16G flash drive in the second small pocket. I plugged it into the PC, downloaded the file right there, pulled it out, and then restored the whole system on the computer. I did the same thing with my cell phone like Valeria suggested. At that moment, I didn’t even stop to think if those steps would actually keep me from being tracked, but just the thought of it sent panic coursing through me like electricity. Sitting on my bedroom floor amidst the chaos, my body felt tense and numb all at once. After a few seconds, I rebooted my phone to try calling Lucia, her sister.

—Hello?

—Lucia? Is that you? Something’s wrong with Val; when I heard her over the phone, it was like she fell into water or something—it was all this rumbling noise. I don’t know what happened; she must've gotten into some kind of trouble or ended up somewhere she shouldn’t be- Realizing I was rambling and not making much sense, I suddenly decided not to mention the file.

—It can't be Mauro; I just talked to her! She was at Santiago de Chile airport in the boarding lounge. We chatted for about half an hour! She mentioned bringing back some fancy bourbon to share...

I stopped listening; none of this added up. How could that be? What on earth is going on?

—Mauro, are you okay? Is something wrong? It’s way too early for this. Are you sure you didn’t dream it?”

—You spoke with her? Half an hour ago? But…- I blurted out without thinking—Are you... really sure it was her?

—Of course, you idiot! It's my sister! Did you smoke some weed again on an empty stomach? 

—Okay, okay, you're right. Forget I asked. Thanks, Lucia. Talk soon.

I ended the call before she could even say goodbye.  

Had that been a dream? I wiped everything from my devices, how would I know if it was real? It felt so ridiculous to hesitate like this.  

This is just bizarre, I thought as I stared at the flash drive in my hand. Shaking off the confusion, I headed up to the attic to dig out my brother's old laptop he left behind before moving to Spain. It was pretty much useless, but it might be enough to check the file. I powered it on and waited for that ancient Windows XP to boot up, then plugged in the flash drive. I opened the compressed folder and saw two files:  

“LabNotes.pdf”  

“PersonalDiary.pdf”  

I decided to dive into the diary first. Based on how it loaded, after reading through it, I found myself staring at the last page's image. Here’s what it said:  

*Day 243 of the 2nd mission 10:40 AM March 12, 2019.*

*I am the head researcher of the Psychological Area at the UN Antarctic base; I'm currently assigned to Project Sisyphus categorized as the highest classified rank.*

*This is going to sound crazy, but the person living with my family is my clone.* 

*It still surprises me when I say it out loud, but after being able to replicate the brain-muscular history (a perfect copy of our memory) of any person and having mastered replicating every cell of our bodies at any age, it was only a matter of time before the development of social biotechnology would emerge. Now and by worldwide agreement, as a complete secret.* 

*There is absolutely no shame or a shred of ethics in what we do, there is no longer any constraint on what we can do to the subjects for the sake of research. That haunts me every day.*

*It all went to shit so fast, I doubt anyone will come to our rescue. The protocol says so, the base in the face of an imminent security risk will erase itself. The structure was designed to collapse methodically following a protocol of incineration and sinking. The immediate perimeter has underwater mines that make the ice collapse almost imperceptibly, but deadly to anyone who tries to leave.* 

*No one can escape from the base, neither the research staff nor the subjects. Our place in the world is already taken.*

*I only hope that this journal along with my lab notes will be found at some point. I managed to construct a small insulating gasket for it so I trust it will survive in case this part of the building collapses as well.*

*Please use this data to let the world know what happened here and don't let perversity define us once again.*

*To my family: I love you and miss you every minute.*

*B.*

At the exact moment I ended the reading I received a video call that made me jump with fright, it was...Val.

With my pulse shaking, I answered the call.

—¡Hey! Can you believe my flight got delayed? This has to be one of my top three worst trips ever. I'm starving, and everything here costs a fortune. What’s going on with you? Seriously, tell me something—I'm sooooo bored!

I stared at her, feeling a bit lost for words. Just as I was about to say something, she cut in.

—What’s up, Mauro? Are you on mute or something? Is the connection good? HELLO! Can you hear me? Can you see me?-She started pacing around the boarding lounge, trying to find a better signal.  

—Yes, yes, Valeria, I can hear you.

She chuckled and gave me that mix of a flirty and serious look she does so well. “Do you miss me?” she asked while lifting her phone in that playful selfie pose she loves. 

—Valeria, didn’t you call me earlier today?

—¿called you? Nope! Why? Oh! By the way, did you know there are penguins in Tierra del Fuego? I'd love to go see them

She rambled on in her usual carefree style, waving her hands and playing with her hair. 

—Well, finally!-She suddenly interrupted herself and jumped out of her chair—They’re calling us to board! Catch you in a couple of hours!

Her goodbye was bright and cheerful as she headed toward the gate. But just before hanging up, her expression shifted completely. She locked eyes with the camera, her face turning cold and emotionless as she whispered almost robotically

—I’m going to retrieve that diary.

My stomach sank, and I felt a chill of fear wash over me. I could not shake the awful and eerie feeling that this person, who was returning, whom I had never in my life called by her full name, was not my friend.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I was completely drawn to transcribing the rest of those crucial diary entries. It’s hard to explain why, but it felt like a mix of moral obligation and just plain curiosity. So, here’s what I picked out.

Lab notes. day 96 of 1st mission 08:00 am December 22, 2016.

Subject JON X012:

First physical assessments: Normal, alert and inquisitive, exhibits some alteration to screens. 

We place 100 cc of sedative in room air. The subject attentively follows the narrative of scenario B5 “The last mission”. 

The subject responds positively to the premises of the story, where he is asked to address an audience threatened by a natural disaster, convincing them to choose a certain path out of the city.  

He offers to collaborate but fails to articulate the message with the power to overcome the simulation.

We resort to pouring 125cc of concentrated Psilocybin into the air as stipulated in the protocol sheet.

The vocal frequency and body language reading receptors in the observation room are activated. The subject manages to formulate a series of premises articulately and with discursive power, circulating around the observation room.

Successful reaction.

We move on to the next stage.

Case is filed under the label “Jobs Project.”

Diary entry: Day 96 of the 1st mission 21:30 pm. December 22, 2016.

Today they transferred subject JON X0012 for psychological evaluation, several in the lab were very anxious about this arrival. I was never the religious type, but I can understand why. Truth be told, 

I always imagined Jesus would be taller.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Day 106 of the 1st mission 08:00 am January 02, 2017

Today we received a new lab assistant for the night shift. Much needed as I was covering these shifts myself and am really burned out. The underground operates at full power at those hours, the hum of the machinery becomes unbearable. This must be why the rooms have an insulating structure.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Day 112 of the 1st mission 19:00 pm January 08, 2017.

The new integration is not very bright. He labeled the transcripts wrong again yesterday and doesn't seem to fully understand the importance of these. I'm going to have to go through the whole method with him again. I don't have much patience lately, it's not his fault, he seems like a nice guy and it's a fact that I need a second pair of hands. I Better start training him myself. Maybe start a sketch of a short explanatory document.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Small introductory guide.

Tim, this is an informal guide to try to simplify your life at the beginning, you will thank me later.

When the subjects conclude the incubation and breeding process (pages 19 to 52 of the manual), that is to say, that they have at least remembered speech and with it, depending on the time in which they lived, reading and writing, they generally begin to perceive themselves. Just before situational curiosity is when the psychology department comes into action. Either to run the “stand by” simulation or the main tests.

In each subject's file is the target of their cloning, the era in which they lived, and the recommended scenarios to trigger the desired response. If the file has X amount on the cover, this corresponds to the generation of the subject, whether it is the first or 10th time it is incubated.

Generally, it takes between 2 and 5 attempts to generate the correct simulation, and administer the appropriate drugs. 

It took 5 attempts to come up with the correct amount of methamphetamine that subject AH X005 (Hitler) needed to function in the scenario, as the correct amount bordered on the overdose.

Simulations are much easier since the implementation of multisensor AI. We managed to generate almost any scenario including temperature, smells, lights and sounds. We tried not to use familiar ones, as human smells are impossible to replicate. We found this out in a complicated way. We tried to recreate a conversation between RR subject X003 (Reagan) and his mother, but he recognized the fakery by the absence of body odor. His mind collapsed and we had to move him to the Underground. The people in Area C (Private Clients) almost lost a very large Chinese account because of that.

After calibrating the subject, we ran both psychological and behavioral tests, scanned retinas, analyzed blood, as well as vocal and body language. But what has really yielded surprising results are the free interviews. It is amazing what some minds are capable of with the right environmental and chemical stimulation. That's why transcription is vital (!!)

Our area develops BAs (Behavioral Algorithms) which are then bought by the private sector, and some government agencies. 

To give you some examples: Twitter was an idea of subject JO X008 (Orwell).

Bots in social media and the use of big data was an idea of JG X002 (Goebbels) and KM X014\`s worst nightmare (Marx) was bought by Amazon.

It is an arduous process and the success rate is low, but when we achieve the goal per subject, well, these results are a mein part of the latest revolutions of mankind.

So follow the lab rules, never refer to subjects by their actual historical name, and always remember, they are assets, not people. 

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Day 117 of the 1st mission 16:30 am January 12, 2017.

Today is a rest day all over area D. I miss many things from the old days that I thought I would never miss, taking a bus, standing in line with strangers and today, I miss Sundays. We only have one on the month. So as usual we gather in the rest area to listen to a liberated jukebox that tries to lighten the mood. I know, right? Why I wrote about this “Saturday” photocopy, well besides the same nostalgic drunks, I was approached by a person I didn't recognize. 

From what I understood he was a rehabilitated alcoholic, maybe that's why I didn't see him on “Saturdays”. He must be in his 50's, portly and wore thick black-rimmed glasses. He seemed to have a slight limp, I noticed it when he went to refill my beer. 

I am a very reserved person and find it hard to talk to people. Truth be told, I've lost the desire to talk to people here. What can you actualy fucking talk about here, if it's not about the same thing. Everything revolves around work and some inter-area gossip, which never escalates much. 

But yesterday was Clara's birthday and to hide the remorse and sadness of only having shared with her the first 3 years of her life, I had a few too many beers. 

We chatted about banal aspects of life in isolation, and the things we miss. For him it was going to the stadium to watch soccer with his grandchildren. I think it was loneliness and nostalgia that brought us together that night.

His name was Sigfried, I don't know if I spelled it right, but it was clearly Nordic. I noticed because of some of the words he mixed up with English. He works as the underground level security manager. We all know that it is one of the most restricted areas and what we have learned in these almost 10 years in the project, is that the more restricted, the less questions you should ask. 

But that day, I think I felt the urge to hurt myself, to go off the rails, so I asked what we all suspected but no one knew for sure. I asked about the blenders. I wish I hadn't.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Day 126 of the 1st mission 08:00 am January 21, 2017.

I almost can't express how furious I am today, but I'm going to try because if I don't, I'm going to punch the new assistant in the face. He has nothing to do with this, he's just mildly irritating. 

Anyway, in Genetic Mapping or area A, they approved the incubation of another Anomaly. It seems to be an express request from a major shareholder and there is not much to say. Anomalies are very risky to reproduce, nature is wise, and for some reason it placed them in history moments where they had their limitations. 

It seems that after the crisis of 2010 with “The Russian Devil” it is no longer scary enough. New school morons... If they had been there they wouldn't even dare to think about it. I AM FURIOUS.

The arguments are that this case lived longer, that the clone would be in his 70s, and that he possessed noticeably more “civilized” traits. As if the court of the last Zar had not been somewhat civilized. 

Personally I think this is a big mistake. Since the discovery that some people possess unknown DNA components and with the 2010 background, they should draw the line. There are certain things, still beyond our ability to understand. But it is delusional of me to think that there are limits, someday the absence of them will consume us all.

Day 142 of the 1st mission 21:00 pm February 06, 2017.

Today was the last session with subject JON X012, I managed to extract the last retinal and body language readings, as usual before sending them to Underground level. We ran the dinner scenario, the truth is that is one of the best simulations we have achieved. The subjects are relaxed resulting in the best free interview environment. This one was no exception, I must say I understand the charm of the “messiah” turned out to be quite an entertaining subject. I hope his next generation will be similar.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Day 152 of the 1st mission 19:00 pm February 16, 2017.

I was tasked with the continuous monitoring of subject NT X001. I am not at all happy with this transfer. First of all, I know nothing about area B of engineering and technology. Secondly, I still think this is a really bad idea. 

One of the laboratories has been set up with the essential simulation equipment and personnel. Tomorrow we start with the calibration.

Lab notes day 153 of the 1st mission 08:00 am February 17, 2017.

First interview with subject NT X001, we run simulation scenario 54-A, “Signal from another planet.”

Subject is observed to be receptive at first but quickly changes to paranoid. We administer 30cc of MDMA via air, according to protocol. 

We introduce the reconstructed figure of a colleague in a cry for help speech.

The Subject laughs and doesn't believe a word, we move to a physical approach plane,

I volunteer myself with a room operator from the engineering area, we show him unfinished plans of an experimental vacuum propulsion engine.

He laughs again and tells us that we are not who we say we are.

We administer 50cc of DMT and move on to the next scenario. 

From the screen an astronaut with non-human features sends a distress signal and intergalactic coordinates.

The subject looks thoughtful, reassesses, picks up the plane and begins to shout out values and what appears to be mathematical formulas.

Air is charged with percentages of absolute sedation.

Audio recording is attached.

It is filed under the name “Project SpaceX.”

Day 153 of the 1st mission 21:00 pm February 17, 2017.

I'm not sure what happened today, this is the first time in 10 years that a subject overcame the deception of 3 simulations. We had to place absolute sedation in the air, as risky as we know it is. I recommended that we restart the process from scratch, but it was a resounding no, the client is in a hurry. 

I need to get more involved in this case to recalibrate the subject. I don't know if I want to. The words before full sedation still resonate with me. “Are you still using DC current? interesting...”

Day 154 of the 1st mission 21:00 pm February 18, 2017.

Something happened, I don't quite know what. The rooms have an emergency lockdown active. Outside hear security personnel mobilizing. I tried the intercom but it didn't work. The insulation prevents my shouts from being heard from the outside. If this goes on another day I'm going to break the lock. I'm going to set my backpack to the bare minimum.

Day 157 of the 1st mission 21:00 pm February 21, 2017.

Yesterday I heard explosions in the B area. I couldn't take it anymore and broke the lock. Whatever it was I had to go out and see. The corridors were dark, and the underground buzzer went on, at least that worked.

I went right to the north staircase, down the 4 floors in near darkness, the power was failing. The entrance to the underground area was barricaded but I managed to see a figure peeking out from inside as they felt me making noises. 

It was Sigfried, he pointed me in the doors direction and I entered through a heavily armored side door. I was surprised by the immensity of this section, it encompassed a large hall below almost all the sectors of the base. In front of us there were 4 large industrial pipes with switches and multiple smaller pipes coming out of their bases. These were repeated like mosaics throughout the area until they disappeared into the distance in the darkness. 

Leaning against one of them were 3 officers in formerly white coats and a nearly dead guard bloodied on the floor. Poor guy, his legs were crushed with his flesh in the open. He was lying in a pool of his own blood. He had a blank stare and it seemed from the pale of his skin, that his fate was imminent. 

My asthma began to pound in my chest sharply, so I reached into my bag looking for my inhaler. I told them between visible gasps of bad breath to please tell me what happened. 

One of the doctors had a badge from area B and another from area E which corresponds to bio-armamentistics. The latter burst into tears and said:

—We deserve it, every one of us. We deserve it.

I knew the other guy, he is an engineer in area B. I could hear him babbling almost nonsensically about, as to why they never thought about it, an issue with electrical power. 

He looked at me carefully as if recognizing me and grabbed me tightly by my jacket pulling me close to his face transfigured for the panic. 

—He let them out, all of them! but not only that, no no no no... He told them the truth. Nikola fucking Tesla hacked us and told them the truth.

He began to laugh frantically with a face of absurdity until he burst into a choked cry. At that moment everything went dark. The emergency lights activated, and from far away and getting closer, along with the emergency sirens that began to sound, we heard a large mass of people screaming and running through the corridors outside.

Sigfried looked at me as they started to pound on the shielded door and said:

—We're fucked.

*Day xx of the second mission, month xx of 2017*

*“()The industrial sounds of spinning blades, the cries for mercy followed by the thunderous, liquid crack down that big pipe, into the green barrels, with the Monsanto logo. Dripped down one side an elongated drop of pink paste ending in the letter E on the chemical label. FERTILIZER.”*

After finishing the transcription, my whole body began to want to flee. The walls of my house were tinged with a faint blue light as the cloudy dusk came through the window. The lights turned off by my abstraction at the computer gave way to the dark corridors that began to feel alien. As I gently closed the PC, my ears began to ring as if under pressure. My breathing became more present and the vibration of my cell phone interrupted my trance.

A call from the office. It was to tell me that I had a vacation week pending, that by schedule, I had to take it starting today.

Sons of bitches, now they even choose your time off - I thought at first. But at the same time, I found the voice on the phone very strange, and truth be told, the procedure itself.

The anger turned into confusion that only added to the paranoia. The sounds in the street began to seem erratic, a chaotic and strangely familiar feeling came over me. My senses seemed increasingly acute, and they screamed:

Go away. 

I grabbed the old laptop, the flash drive, and headed for the bus station. The short trip from my house seemed like a long journey. Faces on the street looked at me with strange expressions, the cell phone kept ringing with unknown numbers on the screen, and a strange idea began to formulate in my head that whispered, ""Them, Valeria is one of Them.""

Already on the platform, I rummaged through my backpack to confirm that I had the key to the family beach house in San Luis, 60 km to the east of Montevideo. I turned off my cell phone, got on a bus heading to another town called Treinta y Tres, which was much farther away. I sat near the last seat and slipped my cell phone into the front pocket of the seat in front of me. I got off and commented to the driver with a clueless expression, ""I got confused, I'm going to the coast.""

I almost jumped onto the steps of the correct bus to where I was heading, unable to avoid the gazes of the passengers questioning me about the last-minute change. I sat in my numbered seat and dissociated, trying to understand what I was doing. I was running away, but from what?

The images of the last transcriptions were engraved in my mind. The last paragraph repeated over and over again, causing me to shake my head from time to time in an attempt to push them away. The road was dark and I lost track of time. The digital clock within sight of the passengers kept ticking since we left, reading 10:40.

—San Luis Station!-I heard the bus driver shout in a low volume.

I staggered to my feet, hurried to get off, and with the same impulse, I entered the dirt roads. I zig-zagged through the dark, cold, and silent beach town. The moonless night and the smell of the sea calmed me down.

When I turned the corner to my family's gabled beach house, there she was, sitting on the steps of the front door, illuminated by a white light. She was waiting for me. I stopped dead in my tracks, and a chilling vertigo ran down my torso to my throat. We looked at each other for a short two seconds., until she stopped and started walking in sliding steps towards me, smiling and playing with her hands, crossing and uncrossing her arms. The growing sound of the wind through the trees covered us.

\-Darling, how are you? How nice is the summer house, I don't think we ever came here, did we? Is it the one your grandmother left you?

I felt the adrenaline rushing through my bloodstream, how could such a familiar attitude from such a familiar person transmit such panic to me? I had to answer something.

\-Yes, this is it. I came to clear my head for a while, they gave me a few days at work and I wanted to take advantage of it- I tried to excuse myself with failed dissimulation, since I stuttered in the middle of the words.

\-Yes, I know! We arranged it with them, so you can be more relaxed and as a gesture for taking care of the file. Ah! and another thing. I think someone stole your cell phone at the bus station-She looked at me with a smart-ass smile.

—Anyway, don't worry, they already found it on a bus on the way to ""Treinta y tres"". You can get it back later.

At this point, I opened my mouth to ask for explanations, but as terrified as I was, I only mumbled 

—Thank you.

All this dialogue left us half a body length away. Valeria looked at me, now a little more serious, and stood at my side. She took my arm, petrified, and I could feel a strong smell of neutral soap invading me, as if she had rubbed herself in it too much.

—Shall we go inside? It's getting cold-she said, finishing the sentence with a sweet gesture of pleading.

—Um, sure.

My trembling hands managed to hit the lock on the third attempt. We entered, turned on the lights, and from her backpack, she took out a red wine. Our favorite.

—Bring me some glasses, Mauro-she said to me as she sat down on the armchair against the window overlooking the gentle hills outside.

She poured wine until he almost filled the ex-cottage cheese glass, looked at me and in a toast gesture said.

—To... Dr. B?

I slid a little smile and raised my eyebrows. Then I took half a glass in one sip.

—Well! - she exclaimed, leaning over and resting the glass on the coffee table, and continued—You must be very confused, I understand, I saw it many times, the mind trying to adapt to a new, unsuspected reality and in your case all at once. It is not easy. First, make sure that no one is going to hurt you or anyone you know in any way. Second, what you read in that file, as you may have noticed, is not intended for public knowledge. Also to tell you…-I couldn't take the stress anymore, I exploded.

—You're not Vale, who are you? You're almost identical, but....”

—Ah yes, that one it's a tricky one to explain. Let's try, let's see:

—I'm a version of Valeria that she accidentally gendered when entered the lab. In one of the incubation rooms she touched a scan button that photographs her mind for 48 hours. It contains a micro needle that took her blood and thus generated me.

—The thing is that we were in a situation of self-destruction of the systems, and that part of the programming code of the protocol was cut off. So, instead of being a mere scan, I became a physical being. That's why I'm here, talking to you.”

—And Valeria? She 's... dead?”

—Well… yes and no. If she tried to leave the base she's probably dead. If she's still there, she's probably frozen to death or killed by the cleanup command, but basically, if I'm here, she's not anymore.

The coldness with which she answered me made me lose the little calm I had. I got up from the armchair and started to back away with my hands on my head, I couldn't stop repeating, 

—this can't be happening, this can't be happening.

—¡Hey! Mauro, calm down, it's going to be ok. I'm Valeria too. In every way, I'm still your friend, I know who you are and everything we went through, really, it's me, and when I finish managing the leak, the code, it won't work anymore, it will be erased from my mind and I'll be me. So don't worry. You only have to give me the flash disc and this issue ends here. We go back to normal and nobody will know about anything.

—¡I'm not going to pretend that my friend didn't die! ¡Alone!, fucking freezing to death, I'm not going to let you take her place, I'm not going to let you!-She interrupted me.

—Mauro, listen to me-she came closer to me and grabbed my hands. Her big, lined eyes looked at me with sweetness, like so many times before.

—I AM Valeria, I have the same fingerprints, the same blood, the same DNA, the same memories, the same scars, absolutely everything. Are you going to tell my mother that I died? and to my sister? Are you going to report me? Nobody is going to believe you at all. If anyone even wants to believe you, how would you prove it? I am an exact copy-she told me, smiling with real sweetness and empathy. 

I could only cry, for my friend, for the helplessness of the conclusion that she was right. I collapsed on the couch, and watched as the hills swayed in the night.

—Let's have the last glass of wine and I'm leaving.

—After I give you this, and that part of you disappears, ¿will you remember that you are not... really Valeria? 

—No, there is already a simulation on pause about Valeria's last week, she won't remember anything about this situation when she wakes up next morning because the memory is simply overwritten.

—So, ¿I'm going to be the only one to know about this?

—Take it as a gift Mauro, a glimpse behind the veil. And if you keep it that way, everything will be fine-The threatening tone was soft but evident.

—Okay, hand me your PC and the flash drive.

I looked at her evaluating all possible actions and if this decision was the right one, she stretched out her hand and smiled sympathetically. I gave her the old computer and the black 16G flash drive with the file. She inserted it, typed mechanically fast until the screen went black. 

—Perfect, That would be all - She took out the flash drive, threw it on the floor and stepped on it violently with the heel of her shoe, put on his backpack and headed for the door.

—Wait, the things that Dr. B wrote... about the underground…

—Yes, there are true, it was the only way to be self-sustainable and to be able to isolate the complex from the rest of the world. Even the most morally flexible scientists would question the work if they knew where the subjects ended up, and what we were doing with their bodies... Anyway, I'm going home, Lucia called me 5 times already. Talk to you tomorrow- she walked to the door and looked at me one last time—I love you, you know?- She smiled at me and closed the door behind her. I felt a car slowly drive away from the house.

I sat on the couch, motionless, trying to take in everything that had happened. From my pocket I took out the white flash drive and looked at it. Now I had a decision to make.",2,1735972244.0,LetsReadOfficial,0,1.0,False

Quantum computing is the center of a **technological arms race**. It is critical for **National security**, Economic leadership and supremacy. ***Rigetti Computing nor any other quantum company***, ***does not need to be profitable*** ***any time soon, as long as the Quantum arms race between countries remains and tensions flare.***

So please, do not give in to the doomsayers, this stock will not come crumbling down or get the rug pulled unless some substantial negative catalyst arrives in the news. Start doing your own research and really dig into the geopolitical climate and why quantum is currently propped up, I understand many work all day and don't want to come home and do more work so that's why I just pop these posts out every now and then.

As I've said in an earlier post, you have a bill getting ready to pass through senate floor which amounts to 2.5billion in funding for Quantum(which may increase substantially now that China announced Xiahong-504, exacerbating tensions). The industry as a whole is expected to grow past 125Billion within the next 5 years(I personally think it will blow significantly past that valuation).

***Rigetti holds many partnerships(And many more to come)***:  
**NIST**  
**NSF**  
**DOE**  
**NASA**  
**NVIDIA**  
**DARPA**

The Government desires Cryptography and Cybersecurity, Quantum offers a break on traditional encryption methods. The Government needs solutions, Rigetti has an answer with expertise in Quantum algorithms and computing.

\-Rigetti has proven the use of AI with Quantum, Rigetti's hardware and cloud-based solutions will be valuable for military advancements.

\-Rigetti specializes in superconducting qubits, it's considered scalable and practical which aligns with the U.S. Governments goal for commercial viability.

\-Rigetti does not rely on foreign technology, it is developed in-house in America.

On new years eve, Xi Jinping announced the **inevitable** **unification** of Taiwan and China sparking tensions even further.

**China has significantly increased its war against the U.S in the cyber space**, targeting critical infrastructure, defense contractors, technology firms and Government agencies. Aerospace, energy, telecommunications and financial services are major targets. The Government is taking extreme measure to increase defense against this and Quantum is definitely one of its major interests.

China and Russia have taken a keen liking to SCC's. NATO has taken a very decisive pre-emptive measure against this. It is called HEIST, a project to enhance the resilience and security of global internet infrastructure, particularly focusing on the vulnerabilities of submarine communication cables. This will shift power back to satellite based infrastructure for those who seek another stock to look at, VSAT.

And this my friends, is just a little tip of the iceberg on why the Quantum Sector is so hot right now.

Along with talking about our goals and aspirations in life, we also went over our fears, and one of her’s was being poor and having no future. She doesn’t want to worry about our life, living paycheck to paycheck. This is very understandable, which I want to ensure we will never have problems with.

My job is at a new coffee shop that is still trying to open, so I havent been able to make any money yet. She is upset, because Imve had time to start making money, but I haven’t put the effort in as she has. She started calling me a child, a mere boy for not putting in enough effort. She down for it, hitting some very sensitive spots. She said I’m no man, judt a boy. I understand where she is coming from, from her viewpoint, I’m not putting in too much effort.

1ht8bg7,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ht8bg7/the_thing_in_the_wetlands/,The thing in the wetlands,"I’m a wetland surveyor at a national wildlife refuge in the Pacific Northwest. Our refuge is remote; it takes about 40 minutes to get to the nearest small town by car. Because of this, we have a bunkhouse on site that employees can choose to live in, the rent is dirt cheap and the only downside is being far from civilization. It’s a rather nice place though, and during the summer is packed full of seasonal employees. But, in the winter it's just me, since everyone else has a place in town. Our office is very small, with only 7 other staff, though during this time of year it’s usually a skeleton crew as people make use of their stockpiled “use or lose” PTO hours. 

Anyways, since I live on site, walking over to the office takes about 5 minutes. Once there I unlock the doors and disable the alarm. I’m almost always the first one in, so I head over to the kitchen and make a pot of coffee. In the summer, I usually just pour a cup into my thermos and am out the door within 30 minutes, but in the winter I get more down time. The light takes about an hour to come out, so I just sit and peaceably drink my coffee checking emails. I check the weather to decide if it’ll be an office or fieldwork day. The forecast says there’ll be a bit of snow, but that doesn’t bother me. I usually only stay in if it says it will rain, I kind of like working in the snow and figure I can just head in early if it gets too crazy.

The light starts to break, so I sign out the keys to a government truck and mark down on a whiteboard that I’m “out,” anticipating to be back by end of day (around 4:30 PM). I don’t usually actually stay out that late, but when I do come in is extremely variable depending on how far into the refuge I’m going, so I just say end of day to avoid any stress when I inevitably come in much later than I’d put on the board. Plus, I’m typically in “SOS” cell phone reception areas so the only way to really contact me is by radio, which I have in case of an emergency. But I keep it turned off so I don’t have to listen to random chatter all day, not that the line would be all that busy at this time of year though.

Regardless, I pulled on my neoprene muck boots, packed my bag (with water, lunch, binoculars, and a first aid kit), and set off for the truck. The refuge is split up into a bunch of smaller named quadrants, visitor use is only allowed on a small portion of the east side, and only along marked trails. I’d already surveyed most of the eastern side, barring a spot in the northern part where we were going to start a logging operation. So, I decided to go to the western area, which was even more remote than the parts of the refuge I was most familiar with. I decided to start at the most southwest point and work myself across, describing wetlands as I went. Essentially, my job is to mark down a laundry list of things about each wetland, such as what type of plants are within the wetland and around it, and of course, if the wetland is currently “wet.” In the winter they usually are, this is the rainy season here. 

Typically, wetlands are surrounded by pine trees and occasionally aspen, and have cattail, bulrush, or reed canary grass (an invasive species) within the basin itself. For me, my primary interest is whether or not a wetland has aspen, as we are attempting to boost their numbers. They are slowly being choked out of the landscape by an increasingly dense forest of pine trees, so the only place we really see aspen anymore is alongside wetlands where they can get enough sunlight and water. Unfortunately, this also exposes them directly to our overabundant elk population, which find aspen to be particularly delicious, and love to bed down in the wetlands for shelter.

For the most part, I am the only person, at least among the current staff, but probably in total, who has ever visited most of these wetlands. When I started my position I was given a shapefile of rough polygons that someone had at some point digitized from aerial imagery. Over time I refined these shapes in the field and added my own, both spotted from aerial maps and found in the field. Suffice to say, staff have been to some of the larger wetlands on the east side extensively, as those are the public facing wetlands, but have probably never had reason to hike to anything this far out. I say hike because there aren’t any roads in this part of the refuge, just a wide enough space by the fence where I could park the truck off the main road.

As I got out of the car I zipped up my coat, put my iPad around my neck, then locked the truck and put the keys in the gas cap. It’s just what everyone does here, I’m sure there’s a good reason for it. The forest I was about to enter looked about the same as on the more public side. Pines spilling over the landscape jostling each other for space, only various unidentifiable types of dry yellow and brown grasses in between them. The ground is cold and hard, both because it is interwoven with a mosaic of dark basaltic rock from eruptions millions of years prior, and because the frost has locked the soils together. My iPad has a built in GPS, and shows me the way forward towards the first wetland. As a general rule when hiking alone you should always try and make noise so the animals know you’re coming. I was told to talk to myself, and sometimes I sing songs, but usually I just put on a podcast, which also does a better job of kicking the boredom I get hiking about for 6+ hours each day.

I hop the rusty barbed wire fence and venture into the woods towards my first wetland. Time moves faster in the woods it seems, I imagine because the memory of the same activity being accomplished over and over again for hours is compressed. My podcast has rolled over into its fifth episode, and after the sixth wetland I’ve been hiking for about 6 hours. It takes me half an hour to an hour at least to assess each wetland, depending on the size, but I’m certainly at least an hour or two's walk into the woods. The most notable thing that has happened in all that time was my startling of a moose bedding down in wetland number three. It was a cow moose and slowly lumbered away. As a rule if I see a moose in a wetland I simply walk the other way, but as she was intent on leaving I stayed and surveyed once she was farther off, and marked in my notes that I observed a moose using the wetland.

I still had plenty of time left in the day. In the summer I wouldn’t work outside past 1:00 PM because of the heat, but in the winter I could work outside all day if I wanted to, depending on the weather. I figured I was in a good position to start doubling back and hitting wetlands on my way to the truck. I started double checking I’d filled out all the data fields for my current wetland, but just then, I heard a rustling noise at the far end of the basin about 50 feet away. I immediately paused my podcast and hunkered down near some cattail. There was something moving in the wetland, I waited to see what it was. After about 30 seconds, I saw a massive pair of antlers rise out of the cattails. It was a Rocky Mountain elk, “the scourge of the aspens” I thought jokingly. I’d never really gotten close enough to see one for more than a few seconds, in my experience they are way more skittish than moose and bolt before you get anywhere near them. They really are beautiful animals. I sneakily took a photo on the iPad and marked that I saw a “bull elk bedding down in the wetland (see photo).” I watched it for a few moments before I realized that I should definitely take a photo on my own phone.

But by the time I got my phone out it had moved behind a pine, it seemed to be looking at something nearby. I followed its gaze and saw an aspen stand I had noted down earlier. It began to walk towards the congregation of trees, beautifully bright in summer, but in winter merely skeletal limbs reaching towards the sky. Aspen are white trees with dark, almost eye shaped, spots similar to birches, but when they grow new limbs they produce skinny red spears with tasty buds tipping each end. I considered revealing myself and scaring the elk away, all I’d need to do is rustle a few cattails and it would probably bolt. But, I also wanted a nice photo of a bull elk chowing down on some aspen. I figured it would be a great picture to use for a presentation on elk browsing at the refuge. So I waited, but I never got my photo. Right as the elk extended towards the aspen bud something dark as tar whipped out of a hole in the ground and gripped its throat. It happened in an instant. I heard the elk attempt to bark a warning call but it only got out a second before its body was effortlessly pulled downwards, its neck cracking brutally on some hard lip above the opening. 

For several minutes I heard cracking bones and the gooey sounds of crushing flesh. It was clear to me whatever I had just seen was breaking the elk down. I began to feel sick and covered my ears in an attempt to stop myself from puking, but to no avail. I began to retch and puked up the elk stew I’d eaten the night before. My boss had brought some in for a party a few days back, and allowed me the leftovers. I tried to be as quiet as possible as broth, vegetables, and chunks of half digested meat flew onto the cold soil. I could feel my stomach muscles contracting over and over again to push out every last drop of fluid until I sat on my side dry heaving and gasping next to a large puddle made up of the night before.

With tears in my eyes I pulled away from the acidic and meaty stench and regained my awareness. Vomit was still permeating my senses and I realized it was in my beard and on my clothes. The promised snow began to fall in heavy flakes as I looked over at the aspen stand, suddenly panicking. But there was no aspen stand, only a pile of red mush on the ground in its place. I hastily searched my surroundings and immediately saw a flash of white advancing to my left, immediately it stopped. It was the aspen stand, now only 20 feet in front of me. I heard a grinding sound coming from within it, and then it began to sway towards me. The stand was about 10 feet across, and on a mound of material 6 feet in height. I’m 5’ 8” in height, so it was just a bit taller than me. I stopped looking at the aspen, and looked at what it was situated on. It appeared to be on soil interlaced with basaltic rocks, exactly what I myself was standing on for the most part. 

But it was moving, ever so slowly, towards me. I took a step forward, and the grinding intensified, but the mound of rocks and soil and trees stopped. I considered trying to intimidate it, but I was too afraid to move any closer and didn’t want to start yelling just yet, so I began to back away carefully. It followed me but stopped when it reached my pool of vomit. The grinding stopped in tandem, and I was horrified to see multiple dark prong like pinchers extend out of what under normal circumstances I would have assumed to be a large coyote den. They covered themselves in the bile as much as they could and then retracted inwards. The mound shuddered and immediately grew ravenous, dipping more appendages into the liquid until there was nothing left visible. It may have taken a minute to do so, and I had continued to back away. I was terrified and knew that I was much too far away from the road, and that I had left my iPad by the pool of vomit. I had pulled it off my neck immediately once I started puking.

Regardless, I knew the way to go. Wetlands tend to form in somewhat straight lines here and I could get back as long as I followed the wetlands I had just surveyed back. Plus, I still had my phone in my jacket pocket if need be. I had regained about 20 feet on the mound when it began to advance on me, no longer as tentative as before. I saw the aspen stand rise up as glittering black legs extended underneath the mound. The aspen stand was now suspended by seemingly hundreds of prong-like appendages that began to rush the mound towards me, blasting through any pines in its wake. I booked it and ran as fast as I could but it was clear to me it would catch up quickly. I began sweating through my jacket and decided that I needed to do something or I wasn’t going to make it much farther. I wiped the sweat and vomit off my face and beard as best I could onto my coat and threw it to the side, immediately hearing a crash to my left that I assume meant it had taken the bait, and was much closer behind me than I had realized.

Immediately I felt the cold bite into me. It was about 30 degrees out but my body was sweating with exertion and adrenaline and I really didn’t feel it after a while. I kept running and running and running and running and running until eventually I hit a road. It must've taken hours, as I had almost immediately given up on running straight down the line of wetlands once the thing had begun to chase me. But I had found the road. My truck was nowhere to be seen. The sky was darkening, and I knew I must've been lost for a good deal of time. I knew I’d run more or less at a diagonal away from the wetlands that were supposed to guide me back and figured the refuge was probably closer than my truck. Plus, there was no chance I was going to head back in that thing’s direction, even if I had shaken it. 

I knew I wouldn’t have service but figured I’d try anyway, so I reached for my phone… only to remember I’d left it in my jacket pocket. I shrugged, I had had no intention of throwing out my jacket until the moment I’d done so. For whatever reason, I felt safer jogging along the road. So much so that I tried taking a break and walking, but realized I needed to keep moving my joints or I might stop moving altogether from the exhaustion and cold. I still had a few layers on, one of them thermal, but without my winter coat the cold had been steadily creeping into me. I had also lost my beanie at some point. It was at that moment I remembered I had a radio, I’d never once used it before but pulled it out eagerly. I switched it on, it was already preset to the refuge channel. 

“Hello! Anyone at HQ? I need someone to pick me up I’m on the main road heading… probably North towards the refuge entrance. I’ve been attacked by something and I’ve lost my jacket and cell phone. I’m very cold and I… need help.” 

I stopped. “Hello?” I said weakly. I sighed, left the radio on, and attached it back to my pack. I took a sip of my water bottle, still amazingly lukewarm from being inside my pack, and continued on the road. No cars ever passed me, but in the end it didn’t matter, because I found the refuge entrance somewhat quickly. It was still a 30 minute walk from there, but at last I knew I’d be okay. When I made it back to the office there weren’t any cars. In fact, I had no idea if anyone had even come into work that day. I probably should have waited longer to see before I headed out. I tried the office door but it was locked. I put my hands in my pocket and put my head against the small rectangular window, my breath fogging up the glass. I had lost my keys too, it seemed. But, before I could panic I remembered I always left the side door of the bunkhouse open, even though I’ve been expressly told not to do so for security reasons. 

“Just a little bit farther,” I told myself aloud. I shambled to the side door and opened it, immediately relishing the warmth I felt. I pushed the thermostat to maximum, pulled a blanket over myself, and fell asleep on the couch within minutes.

I woke up and felt soreness and hunger immediately. Sunlight was streaming in from the blinds and I reached for my phone, when suddenly my memories came rushing back to me. My head ached as I gathered my thoughts, and I tried to figure out what I would tell everyone. I’m sure I must look terrible so they’d have to believe some of it. I decided I’d just tell them the truth. If they thought I was crazy so be it, after all it's not like I’m going to continue working here. I figured that I at least needed to warn everyone there was something out there before I hightailed it. 

But before that, I needed a shower, some coffee, and a nice meal. I cleaned myself up and quickly scarfed down a whole tub of cold leftover pasta, not exactly a nice meal, but still filling. Then I set the oven to 400 degrees for a frozen pizza and put on a pot of coffee. I decided to see who was in today, and opened the blinds that pointed toward HQ. Immediately, I had to look away from the blinding white in front of me. When my eyes adjusted I collapsed to the floor.

“No… but I got away,” I said softly. “I made it home”

Surrounding me were bright white limbs stretching upwards towards the sky. I opened all the blinds in the living room, and they were behind every one. I was surrounded, in a great big aspen stand. There were so many stems I couldn’t even see headquarters, even though it was just a few minutes down the road. The trees were still, and I saw long abandoned bird nests in many of them. Strangely, despite being barren of leaves these were some of the most vibrant and tall aspens I had ever seen. I guess nothing ever got the chance to take even a single bite. Tears streaming down my face I went to my pack and pulled out my radio, went to turn it on but realized it was still on from yesterday night.

“Hello? Anyone at HQ? Or anywhere? Please…” I put the radio down. I left the living room and looked through the window in my room, and then in the laundry room. Aspen as far as the eye can see. I wondered if this is what portions of the landscape used to look like, once upon a time. The bunkhouse had windows in the living room, the laundry room, and in each bedroom. But, I only had access to my own bedroom, all the others were locked up. Only one more place to look. The front door doesn’t have a window, so I cautiously cracked it open to see outside, winter air pouring in and stinging my eyes. Directly in front of me was a gruesome sight. A pile of red, white, and brown mush was about 5 feet in front of the door. I knew immediately it wasn’t an elk, because I could see half of the Fish and Wildlife Service emblem amid the tattered brown of the uniform. But there was still more to see. 

I looked up to find myself staring at a ghastly Christmas tree. The aspen’s skeletal hands clasped my jacket, beanie, keys, and iPad, extending them towards me as an offering. I wondered about the intelligence of this thing, and assume it means to tempt me with these items. Whereas the iPad and jacket are useless, I consider the value of the cell phone weighing down the left pocket of the jacket, and my keys. If I got my cell phone I could call someone, but that would require waiting at least 40 minutes for reinforcements if they left immediately. And certainly whoever arrived would be ill equipped to deal with this, it’d be a death sentence. Though perhaps I would be able to escape in the chaos? I sigh and look at my keys dangling in front of the opening in the mound. The front door leads out to the parking lot and the keys to my personal vehicle are on that keyring. The mound of trees is directly in front of me, but alone, and if I could get my keys I could sprint over to my car and maybe just get away.

I’ve decided that I will wait till night to escape. Maybe the mound can’t see as well in the dark? Maybe it sleeps at night? All I know for sure is that they're active during the day. So I’ll wait for it to get dark. If nothing changes by then, my only chance is to get those keys. I’ll let my eyes adjust, and then I’ll silently pull them off the branch and get to my car. I’ll take the back road out of the refuge and make it into town and just keep on driving. 

While I was writing I heard short screams far off towards the trails. It seems a few people must have gone hiking. All the more reason to take the back road, hopefully these things won’t have any reason to be there. Outside I can still only see a forest of barren white trees staring at me, waiting. I've also been hearing lots of birdsong, much more than usual, especially for this time of year, and the sound of woodpeckers. The birds really love the aspen it seems, and listening to the sound of a happy forest almost makes me smile in spite of it all.",3,1735971896.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

1ht89u6,https://www.reddit.com/r/cuck_femdom_tales/comments/1ht89u6/timmys_new_roommates_part_8/,timmy's new roommates part 8,"The first morning after my mother decided to stay for the week—or was forced to by Brandy—I woke up early, as usual. The house was still, the faint hum of the refrigerator the only sound as I quietly crept out of the guest room, careful not to disturb my mother. The cot I’d slept on left my back aching, but that didn’t matter. I had things to do.  
I started the coffee, knowing Trent would expect it ready and waiting when he came downstairs. Then I prepared Brandy’s breakfast: a bowl of fresh fruit, a slice of multigrain toast with almond butter, and a green smoothie. When it was ready, I set it all neatly on a tray, my stomach tightening as I waited for the blank text from Brandy. It came moments later, and I headed upstairs, the tray balanced carefully in my hands.  
Her door was ajar, and I stepped inside to find her lounging in bed, scrolling through her phone. She didn’t glance up as I entered, her attention fixed on the screen. I moved to her side and placed the tray gently over her lap, the way she liked it: perfectly centered, with nothing out of place.  
Without waiting for instruction, I moved to the foot of the bed, where her feet were already uncovered, the soft blanket pulled back to expose her perfectly pedicured toes. The nail routine had become second nature to me since I’d started my leave of absence. Brandy had trained me to care for her nails with precision, and after weeks of doing it daily, I didn’t even have to think about it anymore. It was just part of my mornings now—automatic, like making coffee or preparing breakfast.  
Every morning, the process began with her feet. I would kneel on the small stool at the foot of the bed, smoothing the edges of her toenails with a fine-grit file. My strokes were light and precise, ensuring the shape remained perfect—flawless, just as she expected. Then came the cuticle oil, applied with careful dabs, followed by a small wooden stick to gently push back the cuticles. Her feet were always soft, her nails already impeccably shaped from her salon visits, but that didn’t mean I could skip a single step.  
Once I finished with her toes, she would hold out one hand, seamlessly switching her phone to the other as she continued scrolling, eating, or sipping her smoothie. Her fingernails required the same meticulous attention: filing, oiling, and pushing back the cuticles. Her fingers rested lightly in my palm, delicate and relaxed, while I worked in silence. She rarely glanced at what I was doing anymore—she didn’t need to. Her trust in my ability to follow her routine was implicit, and if anything were amiss, she would simply hold out the offending nail, expecting it to be fixed immediately.  
As I worked on her nails, she occasionally commented on errands she needed to run or tasks she wanted done around the house, her tone light and conversational,  
Her nails were flawless today, as always, painted a pale pink that matched the soft undertones of her skin. She insisted on weekly visits to a high-end salon, where they shaped them into perfection, but my job was to maintain that perfection in between.  
As I worked on her toenails that morning, I heard the faint rustle of movement downstairs. Brandy’s ears perked up immediately, and she glanced toward the door. A slow smile spread across her face, and she called out casually, her voice carrying through the house.  
“Carol!” she called out, her voice light and cheerful, carrying effortlessly through the house. “Come upstairs for a moment!”  
I froze, my hand tightening slightly on the file. My mother’s hesitant footsteps grew louder as she ascended the stairs. Moments later, she appeared in the doorway, her expression wary. She froze as her eyes fell on me, kneeling at Brandy’s feet, the file in my hand. I saw the flicker of shock in her eyes before she quickly masked it.  
“Oh, good morning!” Brandy said brightly, acting as though the scene before her was completely ordinary. “How did you sleep?”  
“Fine,” my mother said softly, her voice tight. She lingered in the doorway, unsure whether to step inside.  
Brandy waved her in with an easy smile. “Come in, come in. No need to stand there.”  
My mother stepped into the room cautiously, her hands clasped in front of her, her gaze flicking between me and Brandy. I kept my head down, focusing on the task at hand, though my hands shook slightly as I filed her nail.  
“Timmy is such a help with my nail care,” Brandy said conversationally, wiggling her toes slightly as I continued working. “We have our little routine every morning, don’t we, Timmy?”  
“Yes,” I murmured, barely audible. The humiliation I felt as my mother looked down at her 40-year-old son kneeling at the feet of this girl, just out of her teens, while I pathetically performed her daily nail care as she ate her breakfast, made me want to disappear.  
Brandy’s smile grew as she turned her attention to my mother. “I think Timmy likes it. He doesn’t have much contact with girls, so this is good for him. Builds confidence, don’t you think?”  
My mother shifted uncomfortably, her lips pressing into a thin line as she glanced at me again. I couldn’t meet her eyes, my face burning with humiliation. The tension in the room was thick, but Brandy seemed completely at ease, her tone light and cheerful.  
“Anyway,” Brandy continued, glancing at her phone as it buzzed on the nightstand. “I hope you don’t mind if I borrow Timmy this morning. He’s giving me a ride to yoga. But I’ll let you and him spend the afternoon together—plenty of time to catch up.”  
My mother nodded quickly. “Of course not,” she murmured.  
“Wonderful,” Brandy said, already picking up her phone. Her attention shifted back to the screen, her fingers scrolling as though the conversation were over.  
My mother lingered for a moment longer before retreating, her footsteps soft as she descended the stairs. I continued working on Brandy’s nails, my chest tightening with humiliation. She had orchestrated the moment perfectly, ensuring my mother saw me in this position, kneeling at her feet. It wasn’t enough for Brandy to control me—she needed my mother to witness it, to reinforce the hierarchy she had so effortlessly created.  
We returned to the house after Brandy’s yoga class, the quiet hum of the car ride giving way to the faint creak of the front door as I held it open for her. I carried her yoga mat under my arm, still damp and smelling faintly of sweat. She looked incredible in her skintight yoga pants and fitted sports top, her bare midriff toned and glowing from the workout. She adjusted her ponytail as she stepped inside, her confidence radiating with every movement.  
As we entered the living room, I froze at the sight of my mother. She was quietly dusting the furniture, her movements deliberate and efficient, the same way she’d worked for decades in other people’s homes. Brandy’s face lit up, a delighted smile spreading across her face as she spotted her.  
“Oh, Carol,” she exclaimed, her voice full of mock surprise. “You just couldn’t help yourself, could you? You just get right to work, don’t you?”  
I felt my face burn as she scratched behind my ear, her nails grazing my scalp in a gesture that felt both patronizing and dismissive. “Look, Timmy,” she said with a playful laugh, “you finally get some help around here. I feel bad—I keep him so busy sometimes. But he’s just so good at taking care of me, aren’t you, Timmy?”  
“Yes,” I muttered, my voice low and tight.  
Brandy turned her attention back to my mother, her smile widening. “Anyway, I was thinking, Carol—what’s the best thing you cook? How about you make that tonight? It’ll be lovely. We can surprise Trent with something nice.”  
My mother hesitated, glancing between Brandy and me. “Well,” she said cautiously, “I learned how to make a parmesan-crusted filet once, but I don’t make it for myself—it’s so expensive.”  
Brandy waved away her concern with an airy laugh, as though the very idea of expense were irrelevant. “Oh, that’s not a problem here, Carol. Timmy has Trent’s credit card, and I always tell him to buy the best ingredients. Don’t I, Timmy?”  
“Yes,” I replied quietly, the weight of her words sinking heavily into my chest.  
“Well then,” Brandy continued, clapping her hands together lightly, “Timmy, you’ll get whatever ingredients your mother needs—and make one for yourselves, of course. I don’t usually spoil Timmy with such fancy food, but since you’re visiting, Carol, you both should enjoy something good.”  
Her tone was bright and cheerful, but the way she spoke made it sound as though she were doing us a great favor, granting us permission to eat the meal we would spend hours preparing. It wasn’t lost on me—or my mother, judging by the brief flicker of discomfort in her expression.  
Brandy stretched, arching her back slightly before looking around the room. “Well, I’m going to take my afternoon nap,” she announced, her voice softening into a languid drawl. “Dinner around seven sounds perfect, doesn’t it, Carol?”  
My mother nodded hesitantly, her hands fidgeting with the dust cloth. “Of course,” she said quietly.  
“Wonderful,” Brandy said, already heading for the stairs. “Timmy, make sure my mat is cleaned thoroughly, please. And do keep the volume low while you both continue the chores. I’d hate for my nap to be disturbed.”  
“Yes,” I murmured, watching her ascend the stairs, her ponytail swinging with each step.  
My mother glanced at me after a long moment, her expression unreadable. I felt the humiliation pressing down on me again—the way Brandy had addressed her as though she were just another part of the household, the way she had casually assumed my role as a servant and made my mother complicit in it. Without another word, I turned and headed for the laundry room, Brandy’s damp yoga mat still clutched under my arm.  
After my mother had seen me kneeling at Brandy’s feet that morning, filing her nails like a devoted servant while she casually humiliated me about my lack of a love life, the rest of the day carried a heavy awkwardness. We didn’t speak about it, but the tension lingered. I don’t think my mother felt any better about her own situation—being essentially assigned the task of making dinner and guilted into staying another week. It was clear neither of us had much choice.  
The kitchen was silent except for the clinking of utensils and the faint sizzle of the filet in the pan. My mother worked methodically, slicing vegetables for the salad, while I basted the steaks with a butter and herb mixture. There was an unspoken understanding between us as we prepared dinner for Brandy and Trent. It was as though we were both pretending this was just a normal family dinner—one we were cooking together, rather than one we were preparing to serve.  
Around six, Brandy breezed into the kitchen, her presence immediately filling the space. She had changed into another pair of skintight yoga pants, this time in a pale pink, paired with a light sweater that clung to her slim frame. Her hair was tied back in a loose ponytail, and she looked effortlessly beautiful, as though she’d just stepped out of a fitness magazine.  
“How are my little chefs doing?” she asked, her voice light and playful. She leaned against the counter, inspecting the food with a casual air, not bothering to acknowledge the effort that had gone into it. “Everything on track for seven?”  
My mother stammered slightly, her hands still working on the salad. “Y-yes, Brandy. We should be all set.”  
“Good,” Brandy replied with a satisfied nod. “And after you serve Trent and me in the dining room, do make sure you both enjoy some yourselves. Once we’re finished, of course.” She smiled sweetly, her tone making it clear that this was not an invitation but an instruction. “Timmy, I’ll take some wine in the living room,” she added, already turning to leave.  
“Yes,” I murmured, setting down the spoon and wiping my hands on a towel before moving to pour her wine.  
To Brandy, assigning my mother serving duties was as natural as giving them to me. There was no hesitation, no acknowledgment that anything about this dynamic might be unusual. For Brandy, it was simply the way things were: she gave orders, and we obeyed.  
By the time dinner was ready, the table was set perfectly in the dining room. The steaks were plated, the asparagus roasted to a crisp perfection, and the salad dressed and ready to go. Brandy and Trent were already seated when we brought out the food. Trent looked relaxed, his tie slightly loosened, scrolling through his phone while Brandy chatted with him about her plans for the weekend.  
I carried out the main plates first, placing them in front of Trent and Brandy with quiet precision. Brandy gave me a quick glance and a faint smile, her approval subtle but unmistakable. My mother followed with the asparagus, moving carefully as she placed the serving dish on the table.  
As I began to serve Trent, carefully adding asparagus to his plate, he waved a hand to indicate when to stop. “Perfect, thanks, Timmy,” he said casually, already cutting into his steak.  
My mother followed with the salad, standing beside Brandy as she served. “That’s enough, Carol,” Brandy said lightly, her tone pleasant but dismissive as she waved her away.  
The rest of the meal continued like this. Brandy and Trent talked and laughed, completely absorbed in their conversation while my mother and I remained close by, ready to respond to their every need. A few times, Brandy called out for more wine, her tone so casual it was as though she were asking for the salt to be passed.  
“Timmy, another glass for Trent, please,” she said, holding her own glass out for a refill without even looking up from her plate.  
“Carol,” she added a moment later, glancing toward my mother, “do make sure the dessert plates are ready. I’m thinking we’ll want a little sweet after this.”  
The praise came near the end of the meal, just as they were finishing their last bites. Brandy leaned back in her chair, dabbing at her lips with a linen napkin. “This was lovely,” she said, her eyes flicking toward us. “Thank you, Carol. And Timmy, of course. Such a team effort.”  
Trent nodded in agreement, setting his fork down with a satisfied sigh. “That was amazing,” he said, looking directly at my mother. “Seriously, Carol, you outdid yourself. This is the best meal I’ve had in weeks.”  
Brandy smiled, reaching over to rest a hand on Trent’s arm. “See? I told you she’d be a lifesaver. We might have to make this a regular thing, don’t you think?”  
Trent laughed lightly as he stood, stretching his arms. “I wouldn’t complain.”  
Brandy stood as well, smoothing her sweater as she turned to us. “Well, thank you both again. We’ll be upstairs if you need anything. And don’t forget to enjoy the leftovers.”  
With that, they left the dining room, Brandy leading the way as Trent followed, his arm draped casually over her shoulder. The sound of their footsteps faded as they climbed the stairs, leaving us alone in the dining room.  
As the week went on, my mother slipped further into the routine. At first, it seemed like she was just helping out—wiping down a counter here, folding some towels there—but Brandy had a way of making everything feel expected without ever saying so outright. Her casual remarks about how nice it was to have my mother around to ""help out"" had subtly shifted into the quiet understanding that my mother wasn’t here as a guest. She was here to work, just like me.  
Brandy had made it sound like she wanted my mother to stay and visit, but the reality was far from that. She never commented on how things should be cleaned—she didn’t need to. Over the months, her expectations had become so ingrained that they didn’t have to be spoken anymore. Everything had to be spotless. If it wasn’t, I would get reprimanded or, on occasion, outright yelled at for failing to meet her standards.  
The daily routine had become overwhelming long before my mother arrived. Dusting, scrubbing bathrooms, changing sheets—it all had to be done every day. If Brandy left clothes on the floor after trying on half her wardrobe, they needed to be picked up immediately, or I’d find myself on the receiving end of one of her sharp comments. “Timmy, why is this still here? You know I hate messes.” Her makeup station was another constant responsibility—every brush, bottle, and palette had to be wiped down and lined up perfectly.  
And that was only part of it. There were meals to prepare, snacks to fetch, errands to run, and, of course, I had to drive her wherever she needed to go. Brandy treated it all as though it were perfectly normal, a full-time job that revolved entirely around her.  
My mother, though she’d only been here for a few days, had started to fall into the same rhythm. She dusted without being asked, cleaned windows without a word, and never once questioned the fact that Brandy expected these things to be done. As the week progressed, Brandy began treating us both as though we were interchangeable. Whoever was closest got the orders, delivered in her usual offhanded, almost pleasant tone.  
“Carol, see that the guest bathroom is tidied up. Elise might come over later,” she’d say with a flick of her wrist.  
“Timmy, I need a snack—just some fruit. Be quick.”  
“Carol, I’ll be wearing the red dress tonight with the nude heels. Make sure they’re ready.”  
Brandy’s commands carried no malice, no anger. To her, this was simply how things were supposed to be. We were here to make her life seamless, and she didn’t see anything strange about it.  
One mid-afternoon, my mother and I were both working in the living room. I was dusting the bookshelves while she cleaned the windows, the sunlight catching the faint streaks as she wiped them down. The sound of Brandy’s heels clicking on the floor announced her arrival before we saw her.  
She strolled into the room without hesitation, chatting on her phone in that soft, lilting voice she used when she wanted to sound charming. She was wearing a silk robe, the tie hanging loosely around her waist, leaving it open to reveal the delicate lingerie beneath. Her body was flawless—smooth, toned, and glowing as though she’d just stepped out of a photoshoot.  
She didn’t acknowledge us as she made her way to the couch, her phone conversation continuing uninterrupted. She lounged there, stretching out elegantly with one leg draped over the armrest, her robe slipping further open as she adjusted herself. It was as though we weren’t even there, as though the two people toiling around her—one dusting and the other scrubbing windows—were as insignificant as the furniture.  
For a moment, I froze, my hand tightening on the dust cloth as I glanced at her. The audacity of it was almost shocking, even after all this time. My mother, too, hesitated for just a second, her hand pausing mid-wipe before she continued cleaning the glass.  
Brandy’s laughter rang out softly as she chatted on her phone, her voice light and airy. “Oh, I know,” she said, her tone dripping with amusement. “It’s just exhausting sometimes. I swear, people can be so incompetent.”  
Her eyes flicked toward me for a brief moment, though she didn’t address me directly. The message was clear enough.  
The room was quiet except for the sound of her laughter, the swish of the cloth on glass, and the soft shuffle of my feet as I moved to the next shelf. Brandy’s state of undress didn’t seem to bother her in the slightest. Why would it? To her, we weren’t people; we were servants, invisible unless needed.  
When her phone call ended, she stretched again, her robe falling completely open as she reached for the remote to turn on the TV. She flipped through channels lazily, completely unconcerned with the way she was dressed—or undressed—in front of us.  
“Timmy,” she said finally, not looking up from the screen, “can you bring me a glass of water with lemon? And, Carol, make sure these windows are absolutely spotless before you’re done.”  
“Yes,” we both murmured, almost in unison.  
As I turned to head to the kitchen, I caught a glimpse of my mother’s face. Her lips were pressed into a tight line, her expression carefully blank, but I could see the faint flush of embarrassment creeping up her neck. She didn’t say anything, though. She just kept cleaning, her movements mechanical, resigned.  
For Brandy, this was all perfectly normal. She lounged in luxury, her flawless body on display, while we worked quietly around her, too humiliated to protest, too conditioned to resist. It was the natural order, as far as she was concerned. And the worst part was that, somewhere along the way, we’d started to believe it too.  
  
  
Late in the week, the reality of our situation sank even deeper.  
That night, after cleaning up from dinner, my mother and I retreated to the guest room—her on the bed, me on the cot. The space was cramped, and the air felt heavy, weighted by everything left unsaid between us. She hadn’t asked why I was sleeping here instead of in my old room, but the question lingered in her eyes. I knew she wanted to ask, but maybe she was too afraid of the answer—or maybe she already knew it.  
I lay on the cot, staring at the ceiling, my mind racing. Then, it started. At first, it was faint—just the occasional muffled laugh or the creak of a bed frame. But soon, the sounds became unmistakable. Trent and Brandy, loudly and unapologetically having sex in the master bedroom above us. They weren’t even trying to be quiet.  
I froze, my breath catching in my throat. My mother shifted in the bed, the creak of the mattress betraying her wakefulness. Neither of us said a word, but the humiliation in the room was suffocating.  
The sounds grew louder, Brandy’s voice carrying clearly through the floorboards. She sounded ecstatic, her laughter and moans blending with Trent’s deeper tones. They were utterly indifferent to the fact that we were just below them—or maybe they knew and didn’t care. To them, we weren’t family or even equals. We were just… there.  
The realization hit me like a punch to the gut: this was my house. This was the home I had built for myself, the place where I was supposed to feel safe, in control. And now, I was here—relegated to a tiny guest room with my mother—while Trent and Brandy claimed the master bedroom. My master bedroom. They had taken it, just as they had taken everything else. And I had let them.  
Brandy’s voice rang out again, her laughter rising with Trent’s groans. My mother and I lay there, side by side, listening to the unmistakable sounds of their lovemaking. It wasn’t just humiliating—it was pathetic. The woman who had raised me, who had worked tirelessly her entire life, now lay in the same room as me, commanded to stay by a beautiful girl 40 years her junior. And she had accepted it. Just like I had.  
We didn’t even argue. We didn’t fight back. Maybe deep down, we both just knew we were inferior. Maybe we recognized, on some primal level, that we didn’t belong in the same world as people like Trent and Brandy. She had always served people like them, and now, so did I. It wasn’t fair, but that didn’t change the truth of it.  
Either way, it was pathetic—both of us lying here, small and silent, as we listened to the sounds of their pleasure from our cramped little room.  
The sounds eventually faded, replaced by the soft creak of footsteps and muted laughter as they settled back into their room. I stared at the ceiling long after they stopped, the silence between my mother and me heavier than anything I’d ever felt.  
She didn’t say anything. Neither did I. What was there to say? We both knew the truth, even if neither of us could bring ourselves to voice it. I closed my eyes, but the weight of it all kept me awake, the reality of our place in the world pressing down on me like a stone.  
The end of the first week came and went without a word about my mother’s departure. Brandy never brought it up again, and neither did my mom. It was as though the unspoken expectation had settled over the house like a fog—Carol was staying. There was no formal agreement, no direct conversation, just Brandy’s casual remarks that quietly reinforced the assumption.  
“Carol,” Brandy had said one afternoon, her tone light and conversational, “I’ll be wearing the black cocktail dress with the gold heels for Friday. See that they’re steamed and ready, won’t you?” She didn’t wait for an answer, already moving on to the next thought as if Carol’s compliance was a given.  
The implication was unmistakable: my mother wasn’t going anywhere. Tasks and plans for the days ahead were spoken about as though her presence was permanent, woven seamlessly into Brandy’s expectations. And my mother, either too polite or too intimidated to argue, simply nodded and carried on, her silence as much an agreement as any words could have been.  
Throughout the first couple weeks, something else shifted, though I couldn’t pinpoint exactly when it began. It was subtle at first, a quiet transformation that seemed to creep into the fabric of our lives. I started to notice it in my mother—how she would respond to Brandy’s requests with a soft, “Yes, Miss” or “Thank you, Miss.” At first, it sounded odd to me, almost out of place, but my mother’s tone carried no hesitation, no irony. It was as natural as breathing.  
I wasn’t sure if it stemmed from her years spent in domestic work, where addressing people with titles of respect was second nature, or if it was just the effortless authority Brandy exuded. Either way, it became more frequent with each passing day. Brandy might ask for something simple—a cup of tea or a freshly folded towel—and my mother would reply without a second thought. “Yes, Miss.”  
The moment that solidified it came one evening. Brandy strolled into the living room, barefoot, her glass of wine empty in her hand, while my mother dusted the shelves. Without pausing, Brandy said, “Wine, please, Carol,” in that casual, breezy way of hers, as though she’d already expected the glass to refill itself. And my mother—without looking up, without missing a beat—responded, “Yes, Miss Brandy.”  
Brandy didn’t even acknowledge it. She didn’t smile, nod, or make any indication that she’d noticed. She simply turned back toward the couch, trusting the request would be fulfilled, and it was. My mother fetched the wine, poured it, and handed it to her with a quiet “Here you are, Miss Brandy.”  
I watched the scene unfold, feeling an odd discomfort settle in my chest. But even as I questioned it, I realized something strange: it didn’t feel out of place anymore. It just… fit.  
And then, without me even realizing it, I started doing it too. Maybe it was the way Brandy carried herself, so self-assured and unshakably certain that we were there to serve her. Or maybe it was the way my mother said it, her voice so calm and unquestioning, as if “Miss Brandy” had always been part of her vocabulary. But the next time Brandy asked for something and glanced my way, the words slipped out of my mouth almost instinctively. “Yes, Miss Brandy.”  
Just like that, it became the norm. There was no conversation, no agreement—we didn’t need one. It simply happened, an unspoken expectation that my mother and I would address her as “Miss Brandy.”  
She never commented on it, never asked or insisted. She didn’t need to. It was as though she’d known all along that we’d fall in line, that eventually, calling her anything else would feel unnatural.  
One event truly revealed that Carol was not considered a guest by any definition of the word but one of Brandy’s servants.  
One afternoon, Brandy had an argument over the phone with Trent. apparently he had to work late and they had to cancel dinner plans. The heated conversation ended with an angry scream, and Brandy stormed into the living room, her face flushed with frustration. Carol, unaware of the tension, was sitting quietly on the couch with a small snack on a plate in front of her—a rare moment of rest in an otherwise endless routine.  
Brandy stopped abruptly, her eyes narrowing as she noticed Carol seated. The sight seemed to ignite something in her, her frustration now seeking an outlet.  
“Carol,” Brandy snapped, her voice cutting through the room like a whip, “you’ve got time to sit there eating? There must be something that needs cleaning in this house! Find it—now!”  
Carol froze, startled by the sudden outburst. She quickly set the plate down and began to rise, but Brandy wasn’t finished.  
“And another thing,” Brandy continued, her tone sharp and unyielding, “I don’t want to see either of you sitting on the furniture again. If you have time to sit, you have time to work!” She paused, her eyes darting between Carol and Tim, who had just entered the room and stopped in his tracks, sensing the tension.  
“Is that understood?” Brandy demanded, her gaze cold and commanding.  
“Yes, Miss Brandy,” Carol said softly, her hands clasping the front of her apron.  
“Yes, Miss Brandy,” Tim echoed, his voice barely above a whisper, his face flushed with humiliation.  
Brandy let her gaze linger on them for a moment, as if daring them to challenge her, then spun on her heel and stormed off, slamming her bedroom door behind her. The room fell into an uneasy silence, broken only by the faint clink of the plate as Carol picked it up, holding it close to her chest as if to shield herself from further scorn.  
Tim stepped closer, his voice cautious. “What happened?”  
“Nothing,” Carol murmured, her eyes downcast as she busied herself clearing away the remnants of her snack. “She just… wasn’t happy about something.”  
Even though the house was still technically Tim’s, it no longer felt like it. The walls that once represented his independence now felt like barriers closing in, confining him and his mother to a life dictated by Brandy’s whims. First, he had been moved out of his own room to the guest room; now, he and his mother seemed to exist entirely at the mercy of his gorgeous young roommate’s mood.  
Trent and Brandy rarely fought, and the anger soon dissipated. But the idea that Carol was not there as a guest, but as a servant, seemed to solidify after Brandy’s firm reprimand and Carol’s obedience.",5,1735971719.0,cuck_femdom_tales,1,1.0,False

I met this Christian guy (M22 through our campus ministry during my first semester of college. He’s a sophomore, I’m a freshman, and we’re in the same major. I was drawn to his humor and personality, and we’d talked a few times about classes and ministry, mostly in groups. I planned to ask him out for coffee next semester after spending time together at a 4-day conference.)

At the conference, things started great. The first night, we hung out with another couple from our school, and he was friendly, even mentioning he felt ready for his “woman of God.” The next day, I walked pasted him iItouched his shoulder as I said hi and that I would see him later, being more forward. He responded positvely at the moment but later that day he got more distant. Giving short answers when I asked about mission trips that we were learning about but he was not really looking at me and abrubtly walked away from the convo.

On the last day, I complimented his shirt in front of his guy friends, and later, when I asked if he’d dress up for the NYE party, he dryly said, “Plans changed.” At the party, he danced more with his friends (and even other girls than with me. Which was crazy because I never noticed him approach other girls unless they were in a group or joined in the convo! Even when we were jokingly dancing, he barely made eye contact or matched my energy. He interacted normally with others, dancing with the back and matching their energy. I haven't seen or reached out to him since.)

Did I come on too strong, and how can I fix this? I really like him and want to get to know him better.",2,1735971543.0,ChristianRelationship,0,1.0,False
