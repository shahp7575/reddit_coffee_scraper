I just got a Linea Micra some days ago and this morning when I tried to prepare the milk I didn't get any spinning, it was getting hot very slowly and didn't get any foam.

When I pulled out and tried to turn the steamer on again, I realized it was mostly air going out instead of steam.

After a minute waiting I could use it normally again.

It was my first coffee of the day, the pressure was 1.5 bar and water tank was full.

Any idea ? Thank you. 🙏",1,1748059948.0,LaMarzocco,0,1.0,False
1ku2v3a,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1ku2v3a/22f_35lbs_down_am_i_doing_this_right/,"22f - 35lbs down, am I doing this right?","This is my first time posting about this, and I’m looking for some advice and perspective.

I’m 22F, currently 256 lbs (down from over 290), and I’ve lost about 35 lbs since the start of this year, most of it in the past month and a half after making big changes to my eating habits and finally starting to exercise consistently.

I have celiac disease (diagnosed at 18), so I’ve had to be gluten-free for a few years. That part of the diet came easy, but I still used to eat a lot of processed gluten free foods - like mac & cheese (with heavy cream), Vienna sausages, rice, and gf nuggets. I didn’t realize how calorie-dense heavy cream was until recently, and I used to put it in everything. I've since cut it down to just a splash in coffee.

I’ve also cut out sugar and most carbs. I don’t consider myself keto; I still enjoy things like cake or cookies during social events; but I don’t crave them like I used to. I actually used to eat a full-size Butterfinger or Snickers daily to help motivate water intake, but I dropped that completely in April.

Current diet:
• About 1000 to 1500 calories a day
• Low carb (30 to 50g a day), no added sugar
• High protein and healthy fats
• I feel full and have more energy than I used to

Since April, I’ve lost over 20 lbs, so something’s clearly working but I want to make sure I’m doing this safely and effectively, especially long-term.

Current gym routine:
• 30 - 45 min treadmill (walk/jog)
• Strength training (like using the leg press starting at 80 lbs and increasing weight every 15 reps until it’s too difficult)
• 30 - 45 min cycling

I usually spend 1.5–2 hours at the gym. I don’t feel exhausted afterward—just winded, then fine after a few minutes of rest.

My goals:
• Reach 185 lbs by next summer (might be too ambitious, but still)
• Lose fat, build muscle
• Work on core strength
• Find exercises that support my lower back (current routine already helps some)

What I’m looking for advice on:
• Am I eating too little or just right for sustainable fat loss?
• How can I avoid muscle loss or a slowed metabolism while still losing fat?
• Good beginner core exercises that are gentle on the lower back?
• Is my weight progression strategy (increasing every 15 reps) okay or should I be changing that?

Tbh I'm proud of how far I’ve come, but I still feel like I’m guessing a lot. Any advice, tips, or even encouragement would mean a lot. Thanks in advance! ",2,1748059704.0,loseit,0,1.0,False

Turns out, we both do. We start nerding out over our favorite characters and plot twists like it was the 90s all over again. Honestly, I might've even danced around my living room a bit... 🙈 Yeah, it was one of those happy-squeal moments you can't really fake.

We ended up planning a casual coffee meet-up to reminisce over our cartoon-obsessed childhoods, which quickly spiraled into a hilarious friendship fueled by retro TV shows and, oddly enough, cheese tastings (who knew munster could be so bonding?).

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/Sxl62a5lBd)  **Aug 18, 2024**

Okay, so this concerns me and a certain bully from a long time ago - I'll just name him ""Slam"".

In 1997 and 1998, when I was 13 and 14 respectively, for utterly no reason other than the fact that I was the only half-Australian boy in my school (in the city of Ipoh, state of Perak, country of Malaysia), and didn't speak Mandarin fluently, everyone in my class, and the class 1 year senior to mine, decided to pick on me.

I was literally the living definition of ""underdog"" and outcast. Any type of bullying, you name it, I suffered it. Pinned to the ground and punched? Got that. Water balloons on me out of nowhere? Truly well-versed in that kind of suffering. A fistful of chalk dust in my face? Yeah, nothing new.

Slam was, of course, one of my tormentors. He had a special bullying move of his own. Whenever we were playing basketball, none of the others bullied me on the court - except Slam. He made it his mission in life, when he got the basketball, to run to me, and throw the ball at my face as hard as he possibly could.

Sometimes I dodged the ball and got lucky. Other times, it left me with a very sore nose. Or watering eyes. Or a bleeding lip.

Slam did this to me anywhere between 30 to 40 times over the two years of torment. And I never managed to get back at him then. It reduced me to tears quite a few times, getting a basketball to the face.

Now, I am 40 years of age. Slam, being senior to me, would be 41. As luck would have it, as I was perusing a sports goods store in one of my city's malls, I saw Slam. Working as the manager for that store.

I know, ""Be the bigger person"", ""put it all behind you"", ""let bygones be bygones"", that's all excellent advice. But I couldn't help remembering how this person had made my life living hell in 1997 and 1998. The fury and hurt of the past just bubbled up despite 26 years of time separating it.

I walked up to him. Of course, he recognised me, and started acting all affable and friendly, asking me if there was anything I wanted. I calmly told him I'd like to see basketballs. Off he went and got a fine Spalding NBA ball for me.

Once it was in my hands, I calmly and clearly stated, ""Hey Slam. This is for '97 and '98,"" and with all my strength and a hatred I didn't know still existed in me, I flung the ball at him. It caught him full-force in the face.

To say he was shocked was the understatement of the year. I ran off as fast as I could and didn't stop until I got to my car.

I felt fulfilled - like I'd got back something I was owed after 26 long years. However, my mother calls me ""vindictive and evil"". My wife, meanwhile, chided me for ""not being able to let go of the past"". My aunt also said ""holding on to grudges like that will only kill you faster"".

So, Reddit, please tell me - AITAH?

>I mean this is fucking hilarious but not the best way to handle the situation. If you would have verbally confronted him, maybe he would have even apologized. We all did things we regret as kids.

**OOP**

>>Not sure if he would've apologised. Out of 23 tormentors... only 2 have ever apologised to me. One did so and even accompanied his apology with a gift - a bottle of red wine. The other just said his sorries, but I accepted it. The rest? The few times I bumped into them, they never seemed to recall that they were part of the group that rained hell down on me in 1997 and 1998.

>Not sure about AH, but certainly childish and a bit of a b*tch honestly.  
I mean, it'd have been one thing if you stood your ground and finished the confrontation, but you ran out of there like a frightened cat, so exactly what you proved to ""Slam"" is something you should ask yourself.

**OOP**

>>I admit, I probably should've stood there and took what was coming to me, and maybe even fight it out. But fight or flight response took me - and my brain decided on ""flight"". Cowardly? Now looking back at it, yes indeed. I agree with your response.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/8KY5CZhzrI)  **May 17, 2025 (9 months later)**

Alright, I know it's been almost a year, but I finally decided to go and resolve the situation. Opinions were divided on my original post. Some called me an AH for taking out my trauma for being bullied, so many years later. Others said while I was an AH, it was justified. Still others said, no excuses for bullying, my former bully who I named ""Slam"" in the post, deserved it.

Well, I decided to give the matter closure anyway. I decided to go and find Slam at the store, talk it out and resolve it earlier today.

I went to the store after lunch, and Slam was doing his rounds, inspecting the sports gear. He looked surprised to see me, and I raised my hands and told him I wasn't coming to cause trouble, but I wanted to talk things out.

I didn't mince my words, I started off with a direct apology. ""I'm sorry for hitting you in the face with that basketball almost a year ago. I have no excuse, I was angry and let past anger just overwhelm me. I failed to control myself, it was my fault.""

He shook his head and his response surprised me in turn, as he said, ""I have no excuse also. I remember what I did back then, and I really was a jerk. One hit in the face, I think I got off easy.""

Then the biggest shock of all - both of us laughed at that.

Slam then said, ""Look, come with me for a coffee. It's on me. I don't know how to patch up everything I did to you, me and the other guys, back then. But maybe we can have a coffee as a start?"" I accepted.

We went to a café in the mall after Slam instructed the supervisor under him to take charge while he was away, and we talked. I showed him some pictures of my family, and he showed me pictures of his. He was glad to know I was in the tutoring industry, and even said that he might send his oldest child (6f) to me for tutoring.

We also found out we enjoyed some games in common - namely, Borderlands 2, Diablo 3 and DOOM 2016.

After the coffee he went back to his work and I headed to my car, on friendly terms. So, yeah - nothing dramatic or surprising, but a dignified and polite resolution to the matter. I was finishing up preparing my tutoring notes tonight, and thought that I'd post this update, just in case anyone was wondering if the matter unfolded any further.

Well, it's done and over with now, and I'm glad to say the shadows of my past have grown a little less dark now.

1ku2pb2,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1ku2pb2/swarm_confessor/,Swarm Confessor,"The smell hit Teresa before she even opened the car door. Not the usual church smell of old wood and frankincense, but something sweet and rotting, like fruit left too long in the sun. She sat in the parking lot of St. Agatha's, watching the mourners file in for her mother's funeral, and tried to remember why she'd stayed away for fifteen years.

*Because you're a coward,* she thought, lighting another cigarette. *Because facing Mom meant facing what you did.*

The last time she'd been here, she was twenty-two and strung out, stealing from the collection plate to buy pills. Her mother had caught her red-handed, literally, her fingers still wrapped around the crumpled twenties. The look on Elena's face wasn't anger—that would have been easier. It was disappointment so profound it might as well have been grief.

""First Ana, now this,"" her mother had said. ""What demon has hold of you, mija?""

Teresa had laughed in her face. Demons. Everything was demons or angels with her mother. No room for human fuckups, no space for daughters who let their little sisters die because they were too high to remember pickup time.

Her phone buzzed. Marcus again. She let it go to voicemail. Her ex had been calling all week, ever since she'd told him about the funeral. ""You sure you want to go back there alone?"" he'd asked. ""That place fucked you up pretty good.""

""I'll be fine,"" she'd lied, already packing her bags. They'd been separated for three months, but he still worried about her like they were together. Sometimes she missed him so much it felt like missing a limb, but she'd burned that bridge. Easier to hurt him first before he realized what a piece of shit she really was.

The rental car's ashtray was already full. Teresa flicked the cigarette out the window and immediately lit another. Through the smoke, she watched Mrs. Vasquez from the old neighborhood shuffle up the church steps. The woman had to be ninety by now, but she moved with an odd fluidity, like her joints had been recently oiled.

Behind her came more familiar faces. The Kowalski twins who used to babysit her, both of them gray-haired now but walking in perfect step. Mr. Valdez from the corner store. The Nguyen family who ran the flower shop. They all had the same glassy look, like sleepwalking through thick syrup.

And then she saw him—Danny Medina, her high school boyfriend. He'd gained weight, gone bald, but she'd recognize that swagger anywhere. Except he wasn't swaggering now. He moved with the same eerie synchronization as the others, his wife and three kids trailing behind him like ducklings.

Teresa slumped lower in her seat. Danny had been there the day Ana died. He'd been the one driving her to his dealer's house when she should have been picking up her sister. ""Come on, T,"" he'd said. ""School doesn't get out for another hour. We got time.""

They didn't have time.

Her phone rang. She almost ignored it, then saw her cousin Carmen's name.

""Where are you?"" Carmen's voice was tight with panic. ""The service is starting.""

""Parking lot. I'll be there in a minute.""

""Hurry up. And Teresa? Don't... don't take communion, okay?""

""What? Why?""

""Just don't. Trust me. And if Father Matthias tries to talk to you alone, make an excuse.""

But Carmen had already hung up.

Teresa stubbed out her cigarette and grabbed her purse. The flask inside sloshed reassuringly. Time to play the grieving daughter.

The sweetness got stronger as she climbed the church steps. It coated her throat, made her want to gag. The sensation reminded her of the time Ana had hidden Easter candy under her bed and forgotten about it. They'd found it months later, crawling with ants, the chocolate turned white and strange.

""But I saved it for you, Tere,"" Ana had said, her gap-toothed smile proud. ""You said you wanted chocolate, so I saved mine.""

The church doors were heavier than Teresa remembered. Inside, everything looked wrong. She couldn't put her finger on it at first. Same stained glass windows. Same wooden pews. Same crucifix hanging above the altar.

But the light was different. Thicker. It moved like honey through the air, casting shadows that didn't match the objects that threw them.

Then she heard it. A low humming, not quite mechanical, coming from everywhere and nowhere. It seemed to rise from the floorboards, sink from the ceiling, pulse from the walls themselves.

""Teresa? Oh my God, Teresa Martinez?""

She turned to find Sophia Reyes, her best friend from high school, holding a funeral program. They'd gotten high together for the first time in the church basement, smoking weed during the youth group lock-in. Sophia had been the one to score the pot, proud of her older brother's connections.

But this wasn't the Sophia who'd snuck communion wine with her. This Sophia's skin had a waxy sheen, like someone had dipped her in paraffin. When she smiled, something dark glistened between her teeth.

""Hey, Soph."" Teresa accepted the awkward hug, trying not to breathe through her nose. Sophia smelled like honey and something else. Something animal.

""I'm so sorry about your mom. She was such a pillar of the community."" Sophia's eyes didn't quite focus on Teresa's face. They kept drifting upward, tracking something invisible. ""Father Matthias says she's with the swarm now.""

""The what?""

""You'll see."" Sophia leaned in close, and Teresa caught a glimpse of movement in her friend's ear canal. Something dark retreating from the light. ""She talked about you constantly. Every Sunday, lighting candles. 'Bring my Teresa home,' she'd pray. Well, you're here now. Prayer answered.""

The way she said it made Teresa's skin crawl. Like Teresa was a fish that had finally taken the bait.

""Soph, are you okay? You seem—""

""Better than okay. Perfect, actually. No more anxiety. No more insomnia. Did you know I hadn't slept in three years? Not since my miscarriage."" Sophia's smile stretched wider than should have been possible. ""But now I don't need sleep. The hive dreams for me.""

Before Teresa could respond, Sophia drifted away, taking her place in a pew. She sat next to a man Teresa didn't recognize, and they immediately began moving in sync—breathing, blinking, small adjustments happening in perfect unison.

Teresa noticed it then, how everyone in the church moved together. Hundreds of people, but only one rhythm. 

The casket lay closed at the front of the church. Elena Martinez's photo sat on an easel beside it—a picture from before the cancer. But it was the casket itself that made Teresa's stomach turn. It was moving. Just slightly, a rhythmic rise and fall like breathing. And from inside came a soft, persistent scratching.

She found a seat in the back. The pew felt sticky under her palms. When she looked down, she saw a thin film of something amber coating the wood.

The humming grew louder. Not just from the walls now, but from the mourners themselves. Their throats vibrated in harmony, creating frequencies that made her teeth ache.

Her phone vibrated. A text from Carmen: ""where r u?? don't let them see you checking phone. meet me in the cry room after communion.""

The cry room. Teresa glanced over and saw a shadow moving behind the glass. Carmen, pacing like a caged animal.

The funeral Mass began when Father Matthias emerged from the sacristy. Teresa remembered him vaguely—he'd arrived just before she left town. Young for a priest, with pale eyes that never seemed to focus. Her mother had gushed about him in one of her letters.

Now those eyes had an amber tint, and beneath his collar, things moved. Purposeful crawling, as if his neck was a highway for creatures that belonged in the dark.

""Dearly beloved,"" he began, and his voice had too many layers. ""We gather today to celebrate the transformation of our sister Elena.""

*Transformation?* Teresa shifted in her seat. Several heads turned toward her with perfect synchronization, necks rotating at the exact same angle.

Father Matthias smiled. Something black crawled out of his ear, walked across his cheek, and disappeared into his mouth without breaking his expression.

""Death, as we understand it, is an illusion,"" he continued. ""Sister Elena understood this. She embraced the truth that individual consciousness is a prison, while collective consciousness is paradise.""

He opened a book that didn't look like any Bible Teresa remembered. The pages were translucent, like insect wings, and they rustled as he read:

""And the Lord said unto Moses, 'Tell the people I am weary of their repetitions. The same sins, generation after generation. So I shall send new messengers, who speak in frequencies the human ear was not meant to hear.'""

The congregation murmured agreement—not individual voices but one voice from many throats. Mrs. Vasquez stood for the first reading, moving to the podium with that too-fluid gait. But instead of reading, she opened her mouth and released a stream of bees.

Teresa bit back a scream. The bees poured out like black water, more than could possibly fit inside one old woman. They formed shapes in the air—symbols that hurt to look at directly.

The congregation swayed faster now, humming from their throats but also from inside them, as if their bones had become tuning forks.

Her phone buzzed again. Marcus: ""get out of there now. googled your priest. three missing persons cases. possibly more. please T just leave.""

Before she could respond, a hand fell on her shoulder.

""Phone away during Mass, dear.""

Mrs. Vasquez stood behind her, though Teresa could have sworn she was still at the podium. She looked and yes—another Mrs. Vasquez remained there, mouth still open, bees still pouring out. This one smiled with too many teeth.

""I need some air,"" Teresa whispered.

""After communion. We all take communion now."" The grip tightened, fingers pressing through muscle to scrape against bone. ""Your mother insisted. 'Even Teresa,' she said. 'Especially Teresa.'""

""Let go of me.""

""She waited so long for you to come home. Fed her guilt to the hive every day, hoping it would call you back. And here you are."" Mrs. Vasquez's breath smelled like roadkill marinated in sugar water. ""The prodigal daughter, returned at last.""

The Mass continued. Each reading was delivered by bees, the swarm forming words that the congregation somehow understood. During the homily, Father Matthias spoke of transformation. Of leaving behind the prison of individual thought.

""Sister Elena came to me three months ago,"" he said. ""The cancer was eating her body, but it was the cancer of her soul that truly pained her. The knowledge that her daughter suffered alone, lost in guilt and addiction.""

Teresa's face burned. Even here, even now, her mother had to air their dirty laundry.

""She asked if God could forgive a daughter who let her sister die. I told her God does not forgive—He transforms. He takes our pain and makes it useful.""

The scratching from the casket grew louder. The congregation swayed in response.

""Sister Elena offered herself to this transformation. She became a bridge between the individual and the collective. Even now, she calls to her daughter. Can you hear it, Teresa?""

Every head in the church turned to look at her. Hundreds of eyes, all with that amber tint.

Teresa tried to stand, but Mrs. Vasquez's grip was iron. The old woman's fingers had somehow grown longer, wrapping around Teresa's shoulder like vines.

""Communion time,"" Father Matthias announced. ""Today, we share a special feast. Sister Elena's final gift.""

The congregation rose as one. Teresa found herself pulled to her feet, Mrs. Vasquez's hand now fused to her shoulder. She could feel the old woman's pulse through the contact, except it wasn't a heartbeat. It was humming.

They filed toward the altar in perfect lines. The amber light grew thicker, and Teresa could see things moving in it—tiny motes that might have been dust or might have been alive.

As they got closer to the altar, Teresa could see what Father Matthias offered the communicants. Not communion wafers. Something dark and segmented that writhed on his palm. The people ahead of her accepted these things onto their tongues, throats bulging as they swallowed.

Mr. Valdez was three people ahead. When he received communion, his face rippled like water. For a moment, Teresa saw something else beneath—geometric patterns, compound eyes—before his features settled back into place.

Danny Medina took communion without hesitation, and when he turned, he looked right through her. Whatever was behind those amber eyes, it wasn't the boy who'd promised to marry her.

""Next,"" Father Matthias said, looking directly at her. This close, she could see his pupils were gone, replaced by clusters of tiny eyes. Each one reflected a different moment—Ana's accident, her mother's tears, Teresa stealing from the collection plate.

""The body of Christ,"" he said, extending his hand. On his palm writhed something between a larva and a memory. It whispered in her mother's voice: ""Come home, mija.""

*Fuck this.*

Teresa drove her elbow into Mrs. Vasquez's ribs and twisted away. The old woman deflated like a punctured balloon, something wet and yellow dripping from the hole Teresa's elbow had made.

""Run all you want,"" Father Matthias called after her. ""The hive is patient. And your mother is waiting.""

Teresa burst through the side door into the hallway. The humming followed her, coming from the walls themselves. Beneath the paint, she could see movement.

The bathroom door stuck like always. She shouldered it open and immediately wished she hadn't.

The stalls were gone. In their place, hexagonal structures covered every surface. And in each cell, a face. Maria Santos, who'd gone missing three months ago. David Park from the hardware store. Others she didn't recognize, all suspended between life and death.

Their eyes moved. Tracked her. Maria's lips twitched, and a bee crawled out of her tear duct.

Teresa ran. The hallway stretched longer than it should have, doors multiplying on either side. From behind each one came sounds—scratching, humming, her mother's voice calling her name.

The old school building. If she could get to Carmen in the cry room, maybe they could figure out what was happening.

She yanked open the connecting door and found herself in the abandoned wing. The classrooms remained frozen in time, but wrong. Bulletin boards showed her childhood drawings. Math tests with gold stars. A photo of her first communion.

Room 201. Sister Catherine's classroom. The board was covered in elegant loops: ""Teresa is a good girl. Teresa takes care of her sister. Teresa would never let anything bad happen to Ana.""

Room 203 made her stop. Ana's second-grade classroom. Through the window in the door, she could see impossible things.

The desks were covered in honeycomb, and in each cell, something of Ana's. Her backpack. Her light-up sneakers. Her stuffed rabbit, still stained with blood.

But that wasn't what made Teresa's knees buckle. It was Ana herself, sitting at her desk in the front row. Eight years old forever, bent over a worksheet.

Teresa's hand was on the doorknob before she realized what she was doing. Ana looked up, and her face was exactly right. The gap between her front teeth. The scar on her chin.

""Tere!"" Ana dropped her pencil and ran to the door. ""You came! I've been waiting and waiting. Mrs. Vasquez said you'd come back for me.""

""I drew you pictures,"" Ana said, holding up pages covered in crayon. ""Look, it's us at the park. And this one's the day you're gonna pick me up from school on time.""

The last drawing showed two stick figures holding hands. No traffic. No broken bodies.

""Open the door, Tere. Please? I missed you so much.""

Teresa's hand tightened on the knob. One turn and she could have her sister back. One turn and—

""She's not real.""

Carmen stood at the end of the hallway, half her face normal, the other half translucent, revealing structures beneath that pulsed with their own rhythm.

""She looks real,"" Teresa whispered.

""That's what it does. The hive. It takes our memories and makes them into traps."" Carmen stepped closer. ""I tried to resist. We all did. But your mom... she made a deal.""

Ana pounded on the glass. ""Don't listen to her! I'm real! I'm your sister!""

""Three months ago, your mom was diagnosed. Terminal."" Carmen touched the transformed side of her face. ""But she couldn't die. Not with you out there, hating yourself. So when Father Matthias came to give last rites, she asked for a miracle.""

""And he gave her one?""

""He gave her a choice. Die alone, or live forever as part of something greater. Become the queen of a new hive, one that could call you home.""

In the classroom, Ana had started to cry. Perfect tears rolling down perfect cheeks.

""Those who agreed got communion. Special communion. The ones who didn't..."" Carmen gestured back toward the church. ""Storage. Their consciousness preserved until they're ready to join willingly.""

""Why aren't you fully transformed?""

""Because of you. Part of me is still fighting, waiting for you to come home. Your mother's love is too strong."" Carmen grimaced. ""It hurts. But I had to warn you.""

Ana's crying had become screaming. The glass cracked under her small fists.

""We should go,"" Carmen said.

""Where? They're everywhere.""

""The rectory basement. I'll show you what your mother's become. Then you can decide.""

They left Ana screaming behind the cracked glass. Each step away felt like tearing off skin.

The rectory stood behind the church, connected by a covered walkway. The stained glass had changed—instead of saints, it showed the life cycle of bees. In the final panel, a queen sat bloated on her throne.

Carmen led her through the kitchen, past counters covered in jars of honey. Each labeled: ""Grief,"" ""Lust,"" ""Shame,"" ""Rage.""

They descended to the basement. The smell hit Teresa like a physical force—sweetness so thick it coated her throat. The walls were covered in hexagonal structures, massive cells the size of doors.

""The faithful,"" Carmen explained. ""The ones who gave themselves completely.""

One cell contained Father Miguel, the old priest who'd baptized Teresa. His body had been stretched into something architectural—ribs spread like buttresses, spine curved into an archway. His eyes tracked their movement.

The basement opened into a vast chamber that shouldn't have fit. And in the center...

""Mom?""

Elena Martinez sat on a throne of living amber, but ""sat"" wasn't the right word. She had become the throne, her body split open and repurposed. Where her chest should be, a massive hive structure bloomed. Her arms had fused with the armrests. Her legs were gone, replaced by root structures burrowing into the floor.

But her face remained intact. Beautiful, even, in its horrible way. Her eyes were compound now, but they still held that familiar disappointed love.

""Teresa."" Her mother's voice came from everywhere. ""My beautiful, broken girl. You came home.""

Teresa couldn't speak. Could only stare at the thing her mother had become.

""Don't look so horrified,"" Elena continued. ""This is what love looks like when it transcends death. I couldn't leave you out there, drowning in guilt.""

Bees emerged from Elena's chest, each carrying a drop of golden memory. They swirled through the air, forming shapes—Ana laughing, Christmas mornings, all the good times before everything went wrong.

""I collected them all,"" Elena said. ""Every memory of our family. Preserved them. Perfected them. We can live in them forever, mija. No more pain.""

The bees coalesced into Ana, made of golden light and buzzing wings.

""She forgives you,"" Elena said. ""I forgive you. All you have to do is let us in.""

The swarm-Ana stepped forward. ""I missed you, Tere. It's lonely being dead. But here, I can be alive again.""

It would be so easy. Open her mouth, accept the communion, let the hive take away fifteen years of self-hatred.

""She's not real,"" Teresa said.

""What's real?"" Elena asked. ""The sister you killed? Or the one who can live forever in our love?""

The word ""killed"" hit like a slap.

""I didn't kill her. It was an accident.""

""An accident you caused. By choosing drugs over responsibility."" Elena's compound eyes reflected Teresa's face a thousand times. ""But I can take that away. Make it so you were there on time.""

The swarm-Ana reached for Teresa's hand. Her touch felt like summer sunshine.

""Please,"" the swarm whispered. ""I don't want to be dead anymore.""

Teresa looked at this perfect replica, then at her mother's transformed body, then at Carmen. She thought about all the years of running. The bridges burned. Marcus, who'd loved her despite everything.

Then she thought about Ana. Not this replica, but the real Ana. Who'd stolen her makeup and said ""I hate you"" that last morning because Teresa wouldn't let her wear her favorite dress.

The real Ana, who'd been human and flawed and absolutely irreplaceable.

""You're not her,"" Teresa said to the swarm. ""You're just Mom's guilt wearing her face.""

The swarm-Ana's face flickered.

""And you,"" Teresa turned to her mother. ""You don't get to rewrite history. Ana died. I fucked up. We don't get to pretend it away.""

Elena's throne pulsed with agitation. ""Ungrateful child. I'm offering you paradise.""

""You're offering me lobotomy with extra steps.""

The chamber shook. Bees poured from every surface. The swarm-Ana dissolved.

""Then stay broken!"" Elena's voice was thunder. ""But know that I'll be waiting. The hive is patient.""

The floor began to soften. Carmen grabbed her arm.

""Run!""

They fled up the stairs as the basement collapsed. Outside, the congregation had gathered, standing in perfect rows. Their mouths were open, bees emerging in steady streams that rose like smoke.

Father Matthias stood at their head, more bee than man now.

""Leaving so soon? But you haven't had communion.""

The bees descended. Teresa and Carmen ran for the church. Inside, the funeral continued. The mourners swayed while Elena's casket pulsed like a heart.

""Fire exit,"" Carmen gasped.

They ran down the aisle. The casket lid exploded open, releasing a mass of pupae. Each one contained a memory of Teresa—false versions where she'd been a good daughter.

""Join us,"" they whispered.

Behind them, the swarm burst through the doors. Above, Elena's roots punched through the ceiling.

Teresa grabbed a candelabra. ""Got a lighter?""

Carmen pulled one from her pocket. ""Smoking will kill you.""

""Not today.""

Teresa lit the candles and threw the candelabra into the nearest pew. The old wood caught immediately. Flames raced along the rows.

The swarm recoiled. The mourners' synchronized movements broke as survival instincts fought the collective.

""This way!"" Carmen yanked open the fire exit.

They stumbled into the cemetery. Teresa's car seemed impossibly far away. Between them and escape, the congregation emerged from the burning church, shifting between human and insect with each step.

But they moved slowly now, confused. The fire had disrupted their harmony.

They ran between headstones, past the angel statue where she'd hidden cigarettes, over the hill where Ana was buried. Teresa almost stopped at her sister's grave. Fresh daisies lay there.

No time.

The swarm was regrouping. Father Matthias led them, moving with inhuman grace.

""Your mother's love is stronger than fire,"" he called.

Teresa's car was twenty feet away. A wall of bees rose between her and the vehicle, forming Elena's face.

""Please, mija,"" the swarm said. ""Don't leave me again.""

For a moment, Teresa wavered. This was her mother, after all. The woman who'd loved her despite everything.

Then she remembered the thing in the basement. The roots burrowing deep. The perfect lies offered as love.

""I'm sorry, Mom. But you should have let me go.""

She pulled out her flask and sprayed whiskey at the swarm through her teeth. The bees scattered.

Teresa dove for her car, Carmen right behind. In the rearview mirror, she saw the congregation standing at the edge of the parking lot, watching with amber eyes.

""They're not following,"" Carmen said.

""They don't need to. The dreams will come.""

""Then don't answer.""

Carmen touched the patterns spreading across her cheek. ""Seeing you stand up to her... maybe I can fight it.""

They drove in silence. Three miles out, Carmen spoke.

""Pull over.""

At an abandoned gas station, Carmen got out and stared back at the smoke rising from St. Agatha's.

""I can feel it. The pull. It wants me to go back."" She turned to Teresa. ""But I'm choosing the pain. Like you did.""

""Carmen—""

""Go. I'll keep an eye on things. Make sure they don't spread.""

They hugged goodbye. Teresa drove through the night, stopping only for gas and coffee. By dawn, she was five hundred miles away.

She called Marcus from a motel parking lot.

""Jesus, T, where have you been?""

""I'm coming home. The funeral's over.""

""Are you okay?""

She thought about her mother split open like ripe fruit, about Carmen choosing to stay behind.

""No. But I'm alive.""

Three days later, the news reported that St. Agatha's had burned to the ground. No bodies found. The congregation had vanished.

A week later, a package arrived. Inside was a jar of honey with a note in her mother's handwriting: ""For when you're ready to come home.""

Teresa kept it for a month, staring at it sometimes, wondering what would happen if she tasted just a drop. Would it really be so bad to forget?

But then she'd remember Ana. Not the perfect replica, but the real girl who'd put gum in Teresa's hair and screamed ""I hate you"" on that last morning.

She poured the honey down the drain. It moved like it was alive, trying to climb back up the pipes. She ran hot water until it was gone.

She started seeing a therapist again. Told them about the guilt, though not about the bees. She and Marcus began counseling, trying to rebuild.

It wasn't perfect. She still woke up screaming sometimes. Still heard buzzing when the world got too quiet.

But she was learning to carry it. To live with the pain instead of letting it define her.

And somewhere, her mother waited. Patient as only the transformed can be.

The bees would find another queen eventually.

But it wouldn't be Teresa.

She'd rather live with the pain than become it.",1,1748059149.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

In 2018, seven years ago, my fiancé of eleven years surprised me by confessing he “needed” a new poly human he had been seeing in his life, just eleven days after proposing. Trusting our kitchen‑table approach, I invited her to our home: I cooked dinner, baked a two‑tier cake, and mixed cocktails. Instead of a cordial introduction and conversation, his new lover, over twenty years my senior, was openly rude and condescending. He spent the meal displaying overt PDA, never defending or apologizing to me. When they left together and I called him to come home, he refused and hung up. Already battling chronic mental‑health struggles, I was devastated, panicked, and began cutting myself, (I battle self‑harm) that sent me by ambulance to the ER and landed me in a psychiatric ward for a week. He apologized then and accepted full responsibility, but we didn’t begin couples therapy until 2023, five years later, allowing those wounds to fester far too long. 

Now, after years of healing work, (one step forward, two steps back) he insists that his prior lover and I share the blame for that night. I was furious: hosting someone in our shared home demanded basic respect, and the harm lay entirely with them. Yet he still refuses to introduce his latest partner, fearing a repeat of 2018’s mistakes, only to deflect accountability and deepen the trust wound. When I sensed he was catching feelings for his latest partner, I extended another invitation, standard practice for KTP.

She claims a decade of poly experience, yet never once asked to meet or connect with me, his primary partner, which I find peculiar as they have been getting to know each other for five months. Most recently, I discovered “Where Should We Begin?”—an intimacy‑building card game created by a therapist—lying on his coffee table. They’d been working through it together without any regard for my feelings or boundaries, a stark reminder that their bond was deepening while I felt disregarded. When I raised concerns about the game’s implications, he insisted I was placing more significance on it than he was and that she meant no ill intent. I strongly disagreed. After eleven years together, I’m left wondering whether I’ve been deluding myself all this time and whether my loyalty and patience were ever truly reciprocated.",5,1748058904.0,polyamory,4,0.78,False

Seriously focused on getting more quality sleep and enjoying juice and sugar in the morning and for energy but reduced fat.
Ive lived with anxiety for a very long time and have been bullied as well by family, school, work, social settings..

This week I had a crabby repeat client come in to see me for sports massage and he was rude and flat out disrespectful the minute he came in the door because he had to wait for the restroom and just complained about his back.  He was just gross and starting trouble and I hadn't even touched him and Im like ""Naw you can leave!""
And today the bossy old lady therapist at the day spa had a hissy fit because I wanted to work on a specific table with the client who requested me.  I had come in early and set up the whole room for the couples massage and drew the bath (luxury spa).  She was just being miserable and unprofessional because she's territorial but the front desk booked us together.. well I told her she was being disrespectful (she's a bully and nobody at the spa stands up to her) and I did!  Even talked to the manager after I saw her go complain just to let her know what happened and she was a snob about it too (she's like that with everyone) but even when she tried to say I can't make requests I put her in her place because I was being totally reasonable since I set it all up and the client requested me.  She backed down because she knew I was right.

So this happened yesterday, and I’m still trying to figure out how to stage a convincing disappearance.

For context, I work remotely, and my boss is a super serious guy—think ex-military turned software project manager. I had a weekly progress report due and, because I was walking my dog and juggling a coffee, I decided to send it via voice memo instead of typing it all out like usual. Efficiency, right?

Now, here’s where I F’d up.

I had two voice memos recorded on my phone that morning. One was the work update. The other was… a very personal rant I sent to my group chat about how I thought my “situationship” was ghosting me. It was five minutes of unfiltered, mildly unhinged, emotionally unstable whining about how “if he doesn’t text back by 5 p.m., I’m deleting his Hogwarts House from my brain” and “I KNOW I SAW HIM ACTIVE ON IG.”

I finish walking my dog, select what I thought was the work memo, and send it to my boss.

Not 30 seconds later, I get a Teams message from him:

“Hey… I’m not sure this was meant for me?”

I freeze. Check the file. Die inside.

I sent the ghosting rant.

TO MY BOSS.

I panic and send a follow-up message like,

“HAHA oops, wrong memo!! 😂😂 Ignore that!!”

And this man replies:

“Hope he texts back. Also, good luck with the Jenkins deployment. Let me know if you need anything.”

He brought up my emotional crisis and the Jenkins deployment in the same breath. I don’t know whether to cry or respect the hell out of his professionalism.

Anyway, now I have to find a new job. And possibly a new identity.

No inventory, no ads, no high tech website needed. Just pure middleman hustle.  

Here’s the dumb simple way it works:  

### **Step 1: Find Struggling Creators**  
I hunt down people selling eBooks, Canva templates, or PDF guides on Gumroad/Payhip. Most have like 2 sales total. I DM them: *""Hey can I resell your product? You keep 100% of what I pay you""*  

Shockingly, about 70% say yes because they’re desperate for any sales.  

### **Step 2: List Everywhere (Except Where They Already Are)**  
I throw their stuff on:  
- eBay (weirdly works for printables), your own site
- Etsy (under ""digital download"" categories nobody checks)  
- Random niche marketplaces like Creative Market or even Fiverr  

### **Step 3: Profit (Like $8 at a Time)**  
When someone buys from me:  
1. I buy the product from original creator at their price  
2. Download the file  
3. Email it to my buyer with some bs ""thank you for your purchase!"" note  

Margins are tiny ($5-$15 per sale) but it ADDS UP. Last month cleared $387 doing maybe 2 hours/week.  

### **Why This Works**  
- Creators don’t care because they get paid either way  
- Buyers don’t know/care they’re buying from a reseller  
- Platforms don’t police this unless you’re dumb about it  

**Pro Tip:** Focus on ultra-specific niches (think ""Bridal Hair Styling Guides"" not generic ""Instagram Templates""). Less competition, weirder buyers who don’t price compare.  

Not gonna lie—it’s not life-changing money. But for zero risk and almost no time? I’ll take free coffee money.  

Anyone else doing weird little side hustles like this? Or am I the only one exploiting the digital resale loophole? 😅

I’ve been using the **Surface Pro 11** for a few weeks now, and figured I’d share some thoughts for anyone who’s considering picking one up. I’m not a tech reviewer or anything — just a regular person using this for work, media, and some light creative stuff.

**The Design – This Thing Looks Good**

Honestly, the first thing that made me buy it was the way it looks. It’s clean, modern, and just different enough to stand out without being flashy. I’ve had people at the coffee shop ask me what it is. That’s never happened with my old laptop.

It’s super lightweight too. I can toss it in my backpack and barely feel it’s there. Great for commuting or just moving from room to room at home.

**Performance – Better Than I Expected**

I got the model with the Snapdragon X Elite chip. I was a little nervous about switching away from Intel/AMD, but honestly? This thing flies. It boots up fast, runs all my apps without a hitch, and stays cool and quiet.

I mostly use it for web browsing, Office, video calls, and a bit of photo editing in Lightroom. Everything runs smooth. I even played a few cloud games via Xbox Game Pass — no complaints at all.

**Battery Life – Legit All Day**

Battery life is solid. I’ve been getting around 10-11 hours on a single charge with my typical use. No more charger anxiety during the day. That’s a big win for me.

Speaking of which — the charging setup is *chef’s kiss*. I love the magnetic Surface Connect port. It snaps right in, and if I trip over the cord (which I do more often than I’d like to admit), it just pops out instead of dragging the device with it.

**Display and Pen – Great for Note-Taking**

The screen is sharp, bright, and the 120Hz refresh rate makes everything feel super smooth. I take a lot of handwritten notes during meetings, and the Slim Pen 2 works beautifully with almost no lag.

There’s this small moment that really sold me: I was sketching out some UI ideas on the couch one night, and my cat jumped up and knocked my old notebook onto the floor. I didn’t even flinch — just kept drawing on the Surface like nothing happened. Never going back to paper for this kind of stuff.

**Keyboard and Trackpad – Surprisingly Good**

I also grabbed the Surface Pro Flex Keyboard (the new one with the battery and Bluetooth). It’s way better than I expected. The keys feel nice, the trackpad is big and smooth, and you can use it detached, like a little wireless keyboard. Super handy when I’m projecting to my TV and want to kick back on the couch.

**One Weird Glitch (but not a dealbreaker)**

Only real downside so far? I had a weird moment where the screen didn’t auto-rotate when I flipped it into portrait mode. Restarting fixed it, and it hasn’t happened again, but still — kind of weird for a tablet-focused device. Hope a software update smooths that out.

**Final Thoughts**

Overall, I’m really happy with it. It’s not cheap, for sure, but if you’re looking for something that can do tablet and laptop duty without feeling like a compromise, this might be it.

Would I recommend it? If you value portability, design, and battery life — 100% yes. Especially if you’re a student, freelancer, or just someone who likes working in different spots around the house (or coffee shops!).

Not a good week. I had the long weekend so I drove up to a friend's place. For two nights and it honestly kicked me out of my routine entirely. I kept up with walking 10k those two days but everything else went to ...hell in a hand basket. 

I overate probably by 400kcal  but I didn't track and I also ate more than I wanted. It's hard when someone keeps pushing you to eat more and you are in the early days of relearning your relationship with food

 And of things I would usually try to avoid, It also messed up my meal times routine. I don't usually eat after 6 and here I was eating after 6 every day. And so the Monday I came back I got McD's after work. Only a sandwich but it was still late enough it messed with my morning blood glucose which made my ADHD worse in the mornings as well. I would eat normally all day and night time binging would just start. It all culminated in an Oreo cheesecake McFlurry last night that tasted off. I took two bites and I was good tbf but I kept eating it. And that is one rally positive. I find two to three bites of something I want are just as satisfying if not more than eating the whole thing. 


And so that resulted in this morning when I woke up with a very sore stomach, shivers and eventually I was giving praise to the porcelain god. I started to feel better at 2pm. So I made myself some sweet potato fries, avocado crackers with chili and a tiny packet of mini eggs and a Larabar. At the end before work I had a coffee with a bit of oat milk creamer and made an iron skillet brownie which was only 200 kcal, tasted like rubber but paired well with dipping into coffee. I like the effect of sticking a kit kat wafer into brownie batter so I think when I make healthy brownies next time I'll do that for fun. 

So now I'm here. Not much of a loss but this week will be better because.... I actually feel mild hunger before bed. First time in 7 days. Mild hunger is actually easier to ignore than stimulation seeking emotional eating lol. 

And I'm back to routines. Journaling , got 7k steps today  and went to Walmart and only bought what I need so less impulsive. The core of my success is a good routine which needs to be built back up. I think ADHD does make any angle off kilter cause a bigger avalanche to start to gain momentum. So it's so important to have a good backbone, base, habits to fall back on even when everything is overwhelming and dopamine is low. ",1,1748057713.0,FitChallenge,0,1.0,False

I was driving home from work, pretty normal day, and I was in the right lane on a two-lane road. Speed limit is 45 mph, and I was doing just that. Out of nowhere, this guy in a big SUV swerves in front of me with no signal and barely any space between us. Then slams on the brakes because of traffic ahead. Looks like the moron did not know what braking distance meant.

I had to brake hard to avoid rear-ending him, and my coffee spilled all over the passenger seat. Total adrenaline spike. My first reaction was to lay on the horn and flash my lights, and for a second I seriously considered pulling up next to him to yell or just give a not-so-nice gesture. But I caught myself, realized I was probably being *that* person, and just let it go after some deep breaths.

Still, it really messed with my mood. I was shaking for a bit and spent the rest of the drive mentally replaying the whole thing. I didn’t actually do anything aggressive, but I definitely *wanted* to in the moment. So am I overreacting for how angry and shaken up I felt?",1,1748057375.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False

1ku267e,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ku267e/aita_your_kid_cant_come_over_any_more/,AITA/ Your kid can't come over any more.,"We have pretty strict screen time rules for our kids.  Kids rooms are upstairs, and the rule in our house is that the screens stay downstairs (obviously if someone is sick in bed all day or something rules can be adjusted, but on the day to day) and all the phones and tablets go on the charger in the dining room at night.  

My kid befriended another child (both 11/12) they play sports with. We had frequent play dates after practice which usually involved one parent staying with the kids and the other making a coffee run and then we sit and let the kids play while we drink coffee.  I don't love hanging out with this mom, but it was fine. and the kids were worn out afterwards, so thats a plus!  

A few months ago, this mom asks if her kid can sleep over because she has to go out of town for a work thing on Thursday and school is out on Friday.  Sure. Whatever.  Kid came over, it was fine. The kid is a perfectly nice kid and was perplexed by our screen rules, but not upset about putting their phone downstairs.  Kid gets picked up friday evening, no issues.  Then, the next day at practice the mom says something about how she does not appreciate my taking her kids phone away.  I thought maybe the kid just told the story badly, so I clarified that I did have them follow the same rules everyone in our house follows and leave the phone downstairs, but I never said it was off limits. 

I thought that was the end of it, but about a month on from that incident I was asked to host a sleepover again, this time on a friday night.  After I agreed to the sleepover she says ""and no nonsense about the phone this time."" I assumed she was saying ""No silly misunderstandings about the rules.""  Sleepover happens, things go fine. I bring both kids to practice the next morning and had our guest call mom to say that they were up and getting ready for practice etc.. (secretly I wanted kiddo to call and make sure mom was AWAKE and also coming to practice because I had somewhere I needed to be right afterwards and did not have the spoons to drag an extra kid around with us.)  I hear the moms voice over the phone, things sound fine. Call ends with ""bye mommy, I love you too.""  Super normal. 

Mom shows up at practice about 10 minutes before it ends (so, good call on the wake up call lol), and chews me out in front of the other parents for taking her kids phone away again.   I'm not going to get in a fight at my kids sports practice, so I just said ""Yeah, thats not what happened. The kids had a fun evening and got a good nights sleep, something that would not happen if they had a phone up there with them. We can talk more about this, but not now, I have to be somewhere, call me after 8 if you want to"" and I left.    

While ive not been losing any sleep over this, I have been wondering how she even knows her kid did not have the phone in the bedroom overnight, since im pretty sure they only conversation they had before I got chewed out was the one that happened in front of me that morning.    
And then this morning I get a text asking if she can drop her kid off at practice tomorrow morning and stay with us ""for a few hours"" afterward.    
  
I said no.  Two weekends in a row, never offers to host, and the bullshit with the phones?  It's just too much.   ",21,1748057283.0,AITAH,10,1.0,False
1ku25kx,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1ku25kx/the_distinguished_mr_rose_chapter_24/,The Distinguished Mr. Rose - Chapter 24,"No sooner had the party arrived than they were greeted by rows upon rows of intricately laid tables covered in white tablecloth and polished silverware. A crystal chandelier hung from above, dousing everyone in a dreamlike glow, but Lucius had not the chance to admire the glamor before he was quickly whisked away by an attendant and onto a nearby seat. Marco and Mili both were similarly thrown to his side.

“Geez, these folks sure don’t waste time,” Marco grunted, trying to make himself comfortable. “Would’ve been nice if they let us change first. I stick out like a sore thumb, lookin’ like this.”

Marco was at least wearing a suit, even if he did look like an Italian mob boss. The black pinstripes clashed quite distinctly with the regal decor and light colors. On the opposite end, however, was someone much more flashy.

Mili gave him a glare and gestured to herself. “You think you stick out? My outfit’s practically screaming that I don’t belong here. I look like a yellow disco ball partying in the middle of the queen’s birthday bash.”

Marco laughed. “Did ya see how they were starin’ at us? Must’ve thought we were aliens or something.”

“We might as well be. Wherever the heck this place is, it sure ain’t anywhere near our galaxy. I’m surprised they even speak English here.”

Ah, now that was where she was wrong.

“Do you think so?” Lucius asked. “I am rather skeptical of that notion, myself.”

The duo tilted their heads in unison, confused.

“Do you remember the Archbishop’s speech? We were a bit far away, but I saw very clearly his appearance then. The man’s words did not match the movement of his lips.”

Lucius recalled a similar experience in the past. He used to peruse the local movie theatre and enjoyed watching films by foreign directors. The dialogue typically was in a different language, and so oftentimes companies would hire separate actors to voice over the original. The lines were in english, but the mouthed pronunciation noticeably clashed.

It wasn’t just in language Lucius and these other-worlders differed, but appearance as well. It was subtle, and at first glance the natives of this empire resembled that of early Germanic ancestry, but there were little details that didn’t match any genealogy that Lucius knew. Whatever their root heritage was, it never existed on Earth. It made the gentleman wonder if they were even of the human race, or were beings that simply shared common similarities: like the relationship between Homo Sapien and Homo Erectus.

It was an interesting thought experiment, but Lucius’s musings would soon come to an end. The doors of the hall burst wide open, and fanciful platters of food came pouring out by the thousands. Lucius couldn’t quite tell the contents since they were covered by a metal dome; however, if the delightfully fragrant smell was any indicator, then the meal must’ve been delicious.

Marco’s stomach growled, and he had to hold himself back from drooling. “Y’know, it might just be the hunger and all considerin’ we didn’t eat for two days straight, but good lord that smells more heavenly than anything I’ve ever had in my life.”

Mili *didn’t* hold herself back. She drooled with a wickedly gluttonous grin. “They better have more, ‘cause I’m stuffin’ myself so hard you’ll have to roll me outta here.”

The attendants set the plates down on the table. Steam rose up from the narrow splits, wafting for all to take in, and upon the grand reveal, Lucius was met with… a gigantic flower. It was stewed in some sort of cream sauce, the top sprinkled with peppercorns and fresh herbs, but no assortment of garnishes changed the fact that the main course was a flower. There were other, more familiar, fares spread about such as breads and soups, but where would ordinarily be a variety of meat was instead replaced by floral substitutes. Certainly not what he was expecting, but the gentleman was overjoyed nonetheless to discover new, unknown species. The others weren’t as pleased.

“Now that’s new…” Marco whispered. “It’s a meat-shaped flower. Looks like a fillet, but more green. ”

Mili stared at the dish as if doing so would somehow transform it into a sizable hunk of meat. Her wish, sadly, was in vain. “I dunno about this. I’m not a picky eater, but… it looks kinda funky. And I usually love my vegetables.”

All around her, people voiced similar hesitations. They poked and prodded the flower, and they recoiled as a vibrant green juice dripped from its side - flowing like blood. The liquid was slightly thick, a bit viscous to the touch. None dared to let it touch their lips.

Except for one person. A certain gentleman neatly unfolded his napkin, picked up his knife and fork, and gracefully cut apart a large piece of the flower as if it were a steak.

Marco and Mili winced at his apparent nonchalance. Others watched with bated breaths as Lucius lifted the meat-flower, and took a slow, deliberate bite. He chewed it. Let it roll around his tongue. He savored the flavor and indulged in its vast complexity, before swallowing it in one gulp.

“... Well?” Mili asked, leaning on the edge of her seat.

Lucius closed his eyes, let out a deep exhale, and clapped.

“I have had the pleasure of tasting many, many luxuries back in my day,” he began. “From artisanal French dishes to the bold and impactful flavors of Asia… I have sampled it all. And yet, it is not until this day that I can proclaim from the bottom of my heart that I have found the peak of culinary greatness.”

Marco stared at Lucius as if he was a madman. “Is it really that good?”

“Quite. The flower itself has a texture not dissimilar to a well-marbled cut of ribeye, but it has been softened even further so by what I assume must be some manner of marinade: fruity, a bit sweet, yet not overpoweringly enough to mask its natural flavor. Upon reaching your mouth, it melts away like butter, leaving behind these wonderful notes of richness and depth - which is only further compounded by the velvety, creamy peppercorn sauce that both lends a welcome kick of heat and a pleasant mouthfeel. Despite all distinct flavors, however, there is never a sense of greasiness or disharmony. The herbs mingle in the aftertaste - fresh, refreshing. One could feast on this dish all day without ever growing tired.”

Lucius was well and truly sincere in his review. The techniques and meticulous preparation required in the making of this gourmet ecstasy would make even the most veteran of cooks cry out in despair. To balance all these varying elements of flavor equally… only a master was capable of such a feat.

Lucius elegantly wiped his mouth and beckoned for an attendant. “Please give my compliments to the chef.”

The attendant's eyes lit up in delight, and for the first time after arriving in this world, Lucius was met with a heartfelt smile rather than a wary frown. “Of course, sir. To receive your praise would be an honor.”

A new mood settled in the hall. The hesitation and doubt that once mingled amongst the players was now replaced by a greater, inescapable curiosity. Those spurred on by Lucius’s words tried a small piece for themself, only to suddenly descend into a ravenous hunger as they ripped and tore into their meal with great enthusiasm.

Marco grimaced, reluctantly raising the flower to his mouth, but the look in the man’s eyes after he had tasted it for himself was nothing short of euphoric. “God help me, that’s even better than my nonna’s home-cured gabagool.”

Soon, there was hardly a soul seen not feasting on the grand spread before them. Mili however seemed to have something on her mind. She moved to pick up the fork, but then suddenly stopped and wistfully stared at the dish.

“Is something the matter, Miss Mili?” Lucius asked.

The musician’s cheeks flushed bright red. “Um… I don’t…”

“What was that?” Marco said. “Can’t hear anythin’ when you mumble.”

Mili sighed and dramatically waved towards her silverware. “I don’t know how to eat all fancy-like, okay? The only meals I was able to nibble on during my tours were stuff like day old sandwiches or cups of instant noodles. A gal like me’s too damn busy to learn this stuff. Like, why the heck are there three different types of forks? What’s with the big spoon and little spoon?”

Marco froze in place, utterly baffled, and then let out a loud laugh that came straight from the belly. “What, that’s what you’ve been broodin’ about? We don’t even know if the table manners here are the same as ours. Just do what you want. They’re not gonna nag you if ya get somethin’ wrong.”

“Yeah, but… I don’t want to be a *savage*, y’know? When in a fancy place, do as the fancy people do. I want to be a prim and proper lady.”

Lucius was just about to volunteer himself to help, when Marco stood up and begrudgingly gave her a surprisingly thorough lesson on dining etiquette.

“It’s really not that complicated,” he said, pointing to each individual utensil. “General rule of thumb is to work from the outside and make your way inward. The smaller fork is for salad, middle one your fish and sides, and the larger one your main entree. Spoons are kinda similar, but the bigger one’s on the outside ‘cause it’s for soups. You use the smaller one if they bring out coffee or tea.”

“Huh…” she muttered, and glanced up at Marco with a new, bewildered respect. “And the little small plate?”

“Bread. That’s what the miniature knife is there for.”

“Cool.” Mili gave him a big thumbs up. “I didn’t take you to be the type of guy to know all this sophisticated stuff.”

Marco cracked a smile. “Bah, not really by choice. Annoyin’ part of runnin’ a company is that the shareholders are always tryna drag you to a meeting at some steakhouse or glitzy club. I figured with a rough face like mine, I should at least know my manners so I wouldn’t be mistaken for a thug.”

“Annoying? That sounds amazing. I’d love to sip wine and eat food all day.”

“I thought so myself, at least the first couple of times. After a few hundred visits it started to get old real fast. Makes ya appreciate the more dingy and run-down spots: I’d figuratively kill for a greasy slice of ‘roni at Lenny’s Pizzeria - the original one. Was just fifty cents back then. Those were the days…”

Before the old mobster could regale them with the stories of his youth, a loud horn blared through the hall. At the very end entered the Archbishop, accompanied by a knight of much grander decoration and emblems than the others surrounding them - he was the second out of all Lucius had seen thus far to bare the mark of an eagle, which flaunted itself boldly on his pitch-black cuirass.

The knight was a giant of a man, a few inches taller than even Marco, but what drew the gentleman’s curiosity was his broad, imposing figure. Raw strength threatened to pour from his every surface, and though the knight expertly hid it from view, there was no fooling Lucius’s eyes. This one was even more dangerous than the monster of the maze.

The two men sat at a private table and motioned for silence.

“It warms my heart to see you all take such great pleasure in our humble cuisine,” Archbishop Turpin said, nodding his head and grinning despite the players’ slobbish decorum. “Before we begin, I would like to introduce you to my dear friend who shall oversee your stay in the castle. Fret not over his capabilities, for he is of the second-highest authority in the empire, leader of the Twelve Peers, and the most powerful paladin of the Holy Order. Please welcome, Sir Roland of Francia.”

Known each other for a year until she confessed to me, a few months after that we became a couple. We spent most of the time doing what most couples do. Coffee shops, cat cafes, movies, you name it, it was one of the happier moments in life. 

Classes were cancelled and on March 12 we went out to eat at a Japanese restaurant in a mall. I still remember us wearing our matching red hoodies and making out in the car after we had dinner. Then came calls from our families saying news broke that the Philippines was considering a lockdown state. We went home after, thinking we’d see each other in a few days when classes come back by monday. 

That was the last time we would see each other. 

The pandemic came and we didn’t see each other because of how strict it was to go out (she went home to a different city to be with her relatives). 

Then on July 2020, she went to the US to be with her parents. I was happy for her because she wouldn’t stay in this shitshow of a country and she could spend the majority of the time of online classes over there. Little did I know this was the beginning of the end.

We spent more than half of our 3 year relationship in an LDR setup. I’d stay up until 3am PH time just so I we could talk more, she’d stay up until 12pm to do the same. We were half the world away from each other and it was the most we could do. We were doing well around this time, never really had any fights and kept constant communication despite all the sleepless nights. To me, I’d rather spend a sleepless night talking to her than sleeping soundly, this was peace for me. 

On our 3rd anniversary we both dressed up all fancy in a video call and ate the same japanese food we ate when we last saw each other 2 years before. It meant the world to me to be able to do that kahit video call lang. 

A few days afterwards… she asked for a break up. It was followed by silence on both ends and tears running from my face. I always knew deep down, that fear of mine where she’d find life there would be better and I wasn’t a good enough reason for her to stay or come back. 

My fears became true.

She said she doesn’t plan to come back to the Philippines anymore. She would drop out of our college and she’d go to school there and start all over again. She asked me if she won’t come back, “where does that leave ‘Us’ in the equation?”. I didn’t say anything. I couldn’t say anything. I had nothing to say in the matter because no matter how much it hurt me, I understood her decision. I understood that life has different plans for us and it was time to go our separate ways. She told me that maybe in the future when we’re both single and we’d randomly bump into each other again we would give it another chance. Maybe, maybe not. 

We broke up and we ended our relationship. I haven’t heard from her since. 

That was 4 years ago. 

And ever since then, every single woman I’ve met and dated… isn’t her. 

It feels like I’m just filling a void in my heart that hasn’t been filled ever since she left. Every other woman tried to fill it but it hasn’t been the same. It won’t be the same. She was my greatest love and no one has come close to that.

1ku1np4,https://www.reddit.com/r/woodworking/comments/1ku1np4/is_a_basement_woodshop_a_terrible_idea_asking/,Is a Basement Woodshop a Terrible Idea? Asking Before I Regret It.,"Hi all,  
I’m a hobbyist woodworker with a well-equipped garage shop (cabinet saw, planer, jointer, bandsaw, dust collection, etc.). We just bought a home in the Midwest with two large unfinished rooms off the basement. One is about 22x19 with 10.5’ ceilings and open joists—it feels like it’s *meant* to be a shop.

There are no windows, but I could possibly add a vent to the outside later, if needed. The HVAC and utilities are in the *other* mechanical room, so I’m not worried about pulling dust through the house.

I typically build small projects, cabinets, and household furniture (side tables, coffee tables, dining table have been recent projects). I use the shop most weekends and some evenings. The idea of working year-round in a climate-stable space is very appealing—the new garage has no heat or AC, which limits things seasonally. My current shop has no AC/heat, and it can be a real bummer in the midwest climate during the winter and summer.

Power accessibility is decent: the room has 2 circuits with a few 15amp outlets, and the panel is also in the basement. No 220V yet, but access is straightforward if I want to run it. Honestly, it’s easier than upgrading the power in the garage, which has only one circuit and 2 outlets along the wall, plus a longer run to the panel.

A few concerns I’d love feedback on:

* **Dust**: Planning to replace the door with a sealed one, add filtration, maybe build an airlock-style entry? I have a large oneida separator, and a Jet air filtration unit. Would I need more than this?
* **Sound**: The room opens into what will be our den. I don’t plan to use the shop when anyone’s relaxing down there—my wife and I usually work on our own projects before hanging out together. But still - thinking about adding an additional layer of insulation to the shared wall (it's currently open and would be very easy to add to). 
* **Ventilation**: May add a duct to the outside? Is this necessary? 
* **Material access**: Stairs down are wide, and I already break down sheet goods in the garage with a track saw before bringing them in, so that workflow won’t change.

The floor is a dead-flat concrete slab, no vibration issues, and I’ll likely add rubber pads under tools. No signs of moisture—definitely more stable and dry than the garage will be. 

As a backup, the house also has a 3-car garage. I could convert one stall if needed, but again, no HVAC and worse electrical access.

Has anyone here made a similar move indoors? Did it work out long term? What should I plan for or avoid?

Thanks in advance—appreciate the collective wisdom of this sub.",2,1748055580.0,woodworking,16,1.0,False

1ku1iki,https://www.reddit.com/r/Aupairs/comments/1ku1iki/putting_things_away_reasonableness/,“Putting things away” Reasonableness?,"Our Au Pair has been with us for about six weeks now- we didn’t match through an interview process as we already knew her and her family from when we lived in her country. She has for the most part been a lovely addition to our family and seems to be settling in well and making friends. 

Her hours for the summer are:

Monday 9-5 (8 hours) 
Tuesday 9-5 (8 hours) 
Wednesday 9-2:30 (5.5 hours) 
Thursday 9-2:30 (5.5 hours)
Friday 9-2:30 (5.5 hours) 

So 32.5 hours, and we’re in the US. 

We don’t ask her to do weekends, but she is always welcome to join us for activities and we pay like she was one of our own kids when she does join us. It’s 70-30 whether she opts to come along, and no pressure either way. 

But I’m struggling with what may be a translation issue- which is assisting the children with “putting things away.”

Our au pair has jumped in very well to keeping the kids’ laundry going, which I really appreciate as I am back at full time work after ten years at home, and this is the ball I was most dropping. She does the wash/dry/fold for the kids, but I asked her to have them (all girls, ages 10/8/4) put the clothing into their drawers themselves. And it just isn’t happening. The laundry sits out for days no matter how many times I remind her or the kids, and I end up having to supervise putting away 2-3 loads first thing Friday when I get home. 

It’s a similar issue with meals- she’s been doing a lovely job helping the kids make breakfast and lunch. But the milk, leftover French toast, cold cuts, etc. aren’t making it back to the fridge and are sitting out all day. This is something it would be normal for her to have the big kids do also. And the dishes make it to the sink but aren’t washed -kids are also capable of this. 

And I don’t want the kids thinking she is their maid, but I do want her to supervise them cleaning up after themselves and helping the four year old as needed. 

Today too, she helped the girls brush their hair after swimming and made really cute braids. But the brushes, detangler, extra hair ties stayed scattered about the kitchen and coffee tables. 

“Please put things away” isn’t communicating what I need it too. But I’m not sure if I’m asking too much if the kids are fed, having fun, learning her language, and getting outside. ",5,1748055083.0,Aupairs,8,0.86,False
1ku1h08,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ku1h08,"Munchies Mafia in Daan, best pastrami on this side of planet","Munchies Mafia 4.8/5.0
Will be on ubereats soon
Posted to the Taipei Foodie Delivery group on Facebook 

While browsing the Taipei sub Reddit, I came across a review and announcement of a new sandwich place, that happens to be right around the corner from where I live. Then the owner replied on the Reddit post and shared their IG @muchiesmafiatw. So I went to take a look, pictures and menu looked amazing. Im always looking for a good Western style sandwich that's not covered in sweet mayo and strange meats with either overly soft or sweet bread. All my favorites keep closing up shop. My og favorite Bing had this amazing pastrami dip served on a real French roll, then later Liquid Bread made some good sandwiches and they too closed up. Taipei likes to serve paninis and loves using the sandwich press. I like the US deli type, good fresh bread with a dab of real mayo, sliced onions, crisp fresh tomatoes, and rocket instead of lettuce with a variety of different meats be it smoked turkey, honeyed ham, or rare roast beef. 

So apparently Munchies Mafia doesn't have a phone number, you're encouraged to use IG to contact the store. The owner said he signed up for UberEats already but not sure when they will be listed. The menu showed some real promise with some of my all time favorites like pastrami and roast beef, also a handful of Italian style, plus some cheesecakes and creative milk shakes and good coffee. 

IG lists the store as closes at 8pm, a little early for the East District but ok. They are located near the corner of Daan Rd and Civic Blvd, with a small first floor with counter, 2nd floor seating, and an nice outdoor patio with a couple tables. I tried to stop by this past weekend at around 6:30 and was told they are sold out and to come back another day. Other than Bogart's BBQ, Ive hardly ever heard of a spot anywhere that sells out. 

Couple days ago, before going home, I stopped by and picked up s couple sandwiches and a latte to go. Now I can understand why they were sold out, HOLY SHIT!! It's the best pastrami Ive had in a long time. Not overly salty, perfectly cooked, moist and not overly fatty either just the right amount of sauce and veggie mix beautifully presented on a focaccia, they were sold out of the sourdough. All these other spots in Taipei that boast the best smoked meat in town or Taipei's best sando, are all full of shit. Some are more edible than others, most are quite dry and no flavor except for being overly salty. 

The roast beef on focaccia was also quite good, beef was moist and pinkish rare, perfect for sandwiches. But that pastrami, my mouth still waters thinking about it. May have to go get one today and try one of their Italian options. Menu also lists some creative milkshakes which they also didn't have and a black mamba cold brew that sounds like a must try, that they also didn't have. Hope they get on Ubereats soon, so I can order everyday like I was doing at Bing. ",2,1748054934.0,Taipei,0,1.0,False
1ku1gah,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bushcraft/comments/1ku1gah/heat_transfer_in_cookware/,Heat Transfer in Cookware,"When using alcohol stoves, twig stoves or stoves with similar flame, the type of metal cookware is made of makes a huge difference in heating of contents.

Metal has a K rating.  The higher the K the faster heat will transfer through metal. 

Stainless Steel 14K

Titanium.       20K

Aluminum.       220K

Copper.         400K

Metal thickness varies in cookware so K rating is not a direct comparison.

I did a test in my shop where I make coffee for lunch. The cups used are the nesting cups for Nalgene bottles and identical in size. I used a anodized aluminum cup, a stainless steel cup, lid and an alcohol stove.

The anodized aluminum cup gave me the best result reliably over several weeks of testing. This was indoors with no wind.

The Stainless cup averaged 10 minutes to boil 12 ounces of water will the aluminum cup was 6 minutes. Times did vary but the anodized aluminum was 40 percent faster to boil on average.

The diameter of cookware makes big difference, with wider the pot the better the performance.

Before I start, let me be clear that we are still on our journey to become minimalists :)

My husband and I have been slowly but steadily decluttering, trying to be more intentional about what we keep and what we bring into our home. We (especially me) used to live as extreme maximalists. But at some point, we realized that a lot of our stress and sense of unrest came from the cluttered mess we were living in. Now, we’re reducing our belongings by selling and donating (throwing things away is our last resort, since many of our items are high quality and we hope they find new homes where they’ll be better used and appreciated).

Until recently, we lived with another roommate in a two-story apartment. Most of the belongings were ours, but the couch and coffee table were hers. Since we were close friends, we shared her couch without thinking much of it.

Then, at the end of last year, I got pregnant. Totally unplanned, but certainly that was one of the happiest moment in my life. However, one major change it brought was that our roommate would need to move out before the baby arrives, which was just yesterday.

So naturally, we thought that we need a new couch!
We immediately ordered one that *perfectly* fits our living room. The fastest delivery date was the Tuesday after Memorial Day, and we scheduled it without a second thought as if there were no other option.

But after she moved out and the couch and coffee table (we also removed a rug thinking we'll get the new one) was gone something unexpected happened. Our living room was empty, but it suddenly felt open. Breezy, fresh, and peaceful in a way it hadn’t for the past two years.

With nothing to sit on, my husband brought down his Barcelona chair from the corner of his home office and it worked beautifully. We also have a massage chair that’s also great just to sit and relax in. It turned out that this setup was more than enough for the two of us to rest, read, and spend time together in the evenings.

I used to believe a couch was an absolute must that you can’t have a real “home” without one. I never even considered the idea of living without it. But that belief was… just that, a belief. A fixed idea I never questioned.

Today, we called the furniture store and canceled our order.
Not only did we save thousands of dollars, we also gained something even more valuable. The freedom of letting go of the ""must"" and choosing what actually works for us.

Baddy, Casey, and Rhea sat in the living room, the air thick with emotions as they discussed Rhea's recent experience. Rhea's gaze wandered to her right hand, still wrapped in a healing bandage, the burn reminding her of the unknown threat lingering in the shadows.

Baddy leaned forward, her voice filled with compassion. ""Rhea, when you mentioned that mysterious woman, it sounded like she wasn't just there by coincidence. You know how things have been around here lately. Did you feel any kind of... connection?""

Rhea sighed, her brow furrowing as she thought back to that night. ""It's hard to explain, Baddy. When I saw her, it felt like she was there for a reason. There was this... powerful energy. I didn't feel afraid, but I felt like I was being watched, evaluated, almost like she was trying to decide if I was worth her time."" Rhea's voice trembled slightly, her eyes showing uncertainty.

Casey spoke up, her tone curious. ""And then she disappeared? Just like that?""

""Yeah,"" Rhea nodded. ""One second she was there, the next, she was gone. It felt like a dream—like she wasn't entirely real. But I know what I saw. There was something about her presence, something captivating. I can't shake the image of her standing there, with the moonlight behind her. I... I know it sounds strange, but it was beautiful.""

Baddy reached out, her hand resting gently on Rhea's knee. ""It's not strange at all. There's beauty even in the mysterious. But listen, we need to be careful. You were marked, Rhea, and now you've seen someone who might be connected to all this. We're dealing with forces that we don't fully understand. I just... I don't want you getting hurt.""

Rhea met Baddy's eyes, her expression softening. ""I know you're worried, and I appreciate it. I do. But I can't just sit around waiting for something to happen. If she comes back, I need to know why. I need to understand.""

Baddy squeezed Rhea's knee, her voice firm. ""We’ll figure this out together, Rhea. I promise. You're not alone in this.""

Casey chimed in, her eyes filled with determination. ""That's right. Whatever comes next, we'll face it together. And if that mysterious cowgirl wants a confrontation, she’ll have to go through us first.""

Rhea smiled, a flicker of warmth returning to her eyes. ""Thanks, you two. It means a lot.""

The three women sat in silence for a moment, the bond between them growing stronger as they silently vowed to face whatever challenges lay ahead together.

# Havenbrook City - Meeting with Old Friends

Yuri's eyes lit up when she saw Melissa King and B.A. Boom walking toward her on the bustling streets of Havenbrook City. They hugged each other tightly, and laughter echoed through the air as they reunited.

Melissa, affectionately known as M.K., pulled back, looking Yuri up and down with a teasing smile. ""Look at you, still as fierce as ever. How's life treating you?""

Yuri chuckled, shaking her head. ""Oh, you know, can't complain too much. Just hunting down a woman named Carmella. You heard anything?""

B.A. Boom’s brow arched, her expression turning serious. ""Carmella, huh? Not the easiest person to track. What's she done this time?""

Yuri sighed. ""Sold a car that wasn't hers for $2.5 million. Got a friend of ours, Mercedes, in some deep trouble. We've been trying to find her, but she seems to always be a step ahead.""

Melissa frowned, concern crossing her face. ""That’s rough. Havenbrook City's been buzzing lately with all sorts of shady stuff. I mean, the $500 million bank heist? People are saying the whole place is cursed.""

Yuri nodded. ""Feels like it sometimes. But that’s why I’m here—trying to get ahead of all of this before it gets worse.""

B.A. Boom put a comforting hand on Yuri's shoulder. ""Well, you know we're here if you need us. We’ve got your back, whatever it takes. And, hey, we’ve got some old contacts here who might know a thing or two. We'll ask around.""

Yuri smiled, a wave of relief washing over her. ""I appreciate that. I could use all the help I can get.""

Melissa grinned, giving Yuri a playful punch on the arm. ""Always, Yuri. We’re family.""

They stood there, the comfort of old friendships providing a moment of solace amidst the chaos surrounding them.

# Havenbrook City - Jennifer's Search

Jennifer, alone in a different part of the city, kept her focus on finding Carmella. She approached people cautiously, trying to gauge their reactions to Carmella’s name.

She ran into a man standing outside a small bar, his face hidden under a worn cap. Jennifer approached him with a friendly smile. ""Hey, excuse me, have you heard anything about a woman named Carmella? She's kind of been causing trouble around here.""

The man looked up, his eyes narrowing. ""Carmella, huh? You must be with the others. There are people looking for her, you know.""

Jennifer's heart skipped a beat, excitement mixed with tension. ""Yeah, I'm one of those people. We need to find her—for a friend of ours who’s in trouble because of her. Anything you can tell me?""

The man hesitated, glancing around before leaning closer. ""Word is, she’s keeping her head low. Meeting with some big players, but no one knows why. People are scared to talk about it.""

Jennifer nodded, her voice lowering. ""Thanks. If you hear anything more, here's my number. I'd really appreciate it.""

He took the paper, nodding. ""I’ll see what I can do. Good luck.""

Jennifer walked away, her mind racing. The pieces of this puzzle were coming together slowly, but she knew they were getting closer. She pulled out her phone and sent a quick message to Lady Hunter and Yuri, keeping them updated on her findings.

# Lyra's Meeting at the Bakery

The bakery smelled sweet, the scent of freshly baked bread and pastries filling the air as Lyra gathered everyone around the table. Liv, Rihanna, Michelle, and Tatum sat in a small circle, each of them with a coffee cup in front of them.

Lyra looked at her notes, her expression serious. ""We’ve all been feeling it, right? The shift in energy. Havenbrook isn’t just having bad days—something darker is brewing.""

Michelle nodded, her eyes narrowing thoughtfully. ""I’ve felt it too. It’s like there’s something—someone—pulling strings behind the scenes. And these attacks and incidents? They’re connected.""

Tatum frowned, leaning forward. ""The mark on Rhea’s hand, Carmella selling stolen cars, and that mysterious bank heist—it’s all linked somehow. We need to connect the dots before it’s too late.""

Liv glanced around, her expression hesitant. ""Do we even know what we’re dealing with? I mean, are we talking about something... supernatural?""

Lyra nodded slowly. ""It’s starting to look that way. There are people in this town with abilities—powers. Some of us here know that firsthand. Whatever is happening, it’s drawing out those who have a connection to things beyond the ordinary.""

Rihanna looked at Lyra, her expression curious. ""And what’s our role in all this? Why are we being drawn into it?""

Lyra smiled faintly. ""Because we care about this place. We care about each other. That makes us targets, but it also makes us strong. We’re not alone in this fight.""

They all nodded, a silent determination forming between them. Whatever was coming, they were ready to face it together.

# Judy Álvarez's Place

Judy and Alinity lay on the couch, cuddled up close. The two had shared a lot over the past few days, growing closer and closer as they spent more time together. Judy could feel her heart pounding, uncertainty lingering in the pit of her stomach as she glanced at Alinity.

“Hey,” Judy said softly, her voice barely a whisper. “Do you... think this is something real? Between us?”

Alinity looked at her, her eyes softening. “I do, Judy. I know it’s scary, and I know we both have a lot of baggage. But being with you feels right. Like it’s something worth holding onto.”

Judy sighed, a small smile tugging at her lips. “I think so too. It’s just... I’m scared. I’ve been hurt before, and I don’t want to mess this up.”

Alinity reached out, taking Judy’s hand in hers. “You won’t. And even if we stumble, we’ll pick each other back up. That’s what this is about, right? Trusting each other, even when it’s hard.”

Judy’s heart swelled at Alinity’s words, her fears slowly melting away. She leaned in, pressing her lips to Alinity’s, their kiss filled with a promise—of hope, of love, and of the courage to take a chance on each other.

# Alexa's Place - Deeper Conversations

Hendra and Andreja sat across from Alexa, the air in the room heavy with emotions. The journey they had been on was far from easy, but Alexa was determined to guide them toward understanding and healing.

Alexa looked at Andreja, her eyes kind yet piercing. “Andreja, what you did to Alinity—it was a betrayal that cut deeply. You told me before that you regret it, but I need to know what’s behind that regret. Is it guilt? Shame? Or is it truly a realization that you made a mistake?”

Andreja’s eyes filled with tears, her voice trembling as she spoke. “It’s everything, Alexa. I... I was lost. I didn’t know how to deal with my own pain, so I lashed out. I hurt someone who didn’t deserve it, someone I cared about. I was angry at the world, and I took it out on her. And now... now I see the damage I caused, and it tears me apart inside. I wish I could take it back.”

Hendra nodded, her eyes also glistening. “And for me, I stood by and watched it happen. I let my anger at the world blind me to the good things I had. I should have stood up for Alinity, for Andreja, for myself. But I was scared—scared of losing what little control I thought I had.”

Alexa reached out, taking both of their hands in hers. “Healing is a long, painful process. But the fact that you’re here, talking about it, willing to face it, means that you’re already on the right path. You both made mistakes, but you’re more than those mistakes. The key now is to keep moving forward—to learn, to grow, and to be better.”

Andreja wiped her eyes, her voice cracking. “Thank you, Alexa. I... I want to be better. For myself, and for the people I’ve hurt.”

Hendra squeezed Alexa’s hand, her expression softening. “Me too. We’re ready to face this, no matter how hard it gets.”

Alexa smiled, her heart filled with hope for both of them. “Then let’s take it one step at a time. Together.”

*The air across Havenbrook and Havenbrook City was charged with emotions, as everyone faced their fears, their pasts, and their uncertain futures. Amidst the tension, bonds were strengthened, friendships rekindled, and love found a way to blossom—giving them all the hope they needed to face whatever lay ahead.*",1,1748054689.0,u_SilverEnd1208,0,1.0,False

After a few days, Baddy and Casey decided to check on Rhea, who had been keeping mostly to herself since the incident. Baddy knocked on the door, and Rhea opened it, her face lighting up a bit when she saw them.

""Hey, Rhea,"" Baddy said with a warm smile, stepping inside.

""Hey,"" Rhea replied, ushering them in. ""Glad you guys came by.""

The three sat down, and Baddy looked at Rhea’s right hand, the burn mark still healing. “How’s the hand?” she asked softly, a look of concern in her eyes.

“It’s better,” Rhea replied. She glanced at Casey, then back at Baddy, deciding it was time to share something strange. “You know, a few nights ago, I was out walking. I saw someone—some woman standing atop a building. She was in this black leather cowgirl outfit, just staring down at me. It was... different. I don’t know how to explain it, but she gave off a vibe, you know?”

Baddy’s expression shifted, her eyes narrowing as she considered Rhea's words. “Did she seem familiar? Or threatening in any way?” Baddy asked, curious.

“No,” Rhea shook her head, still trying to make sense of it herself. “She looked... powerful. Not threatening, just... like she was watching me, and then she disappeared. It was like she wanted to be seen, but not approached.”

Baddy exchanged a quick glance with Casey. “That’s interesting. With everything that’s been going on—the mark on your hand, the demon business—it might be connected.”

Rhea sighed. “Yeah, it all feels connected somehow, but I can’t put my finger on it.”

Baddy nodded, determined. “Well, we’ll figure it out together. You're not dealing with any of this alone.”

Casey added with a smile, “We got your back, Rhea.”

# Havenbrook City

Meanwhile, over in Havenbrook City, Yuri was walking down a busy street when she ran into two old friends—M.K., also known as Melissa King, and B.A. Boom. Their eyes lit up as they recognized each other.

“Yuri!” Melissa called out, waving.

Yuri turned and smiled when she saw them. “M.K., Boom, it’s been a while!”

They exchanged hugs, catching up on their past adventures and exchanging updates. The atmosphere was light and filled with laughter, despite the tense reason Yuri was in Havenbrook—to track down Carmella.

Elsewhere in Havenbrook City, Lady Hunter moved stealthily through different areas, looking for any signs of Carmella. She kept in constant contact with Yuri and Jennifer, who were also on the lookout, each of them trying to piece together any clues about Carmella’s whereabouts.

Jennifer had split from the group and was combing through a different part of town, carefully asking questions and trying to dig up anything that might lead them to Carmella. The three of them were determined, staying in close communication to coordinate their efforts.

# Back in Havenbrook

In Havenbrook, the tension was much lighter. Sonya and Emiru were in the middle of an epic video gaming war in their apartment, with Cinna and Jenna watching. The screen flashed with bright colors, and the two gamers shouted at each other, both competitive and determined to win. Cinna cheered them on, while Jenna laughed, enjoying the friendly chaos of it all.

Across town, Lyra held a meeting at Thea and Ivy's Bakery. The bakery was cozy, filled with the smell of fresh bread and sweets. Liv, Rihanna, Michelle, and Tatum all gathered around a table as Lyra laid out some notes in front of her.

“Thanks for coming, everyone,” Lyra began. “We need to talk about what’s been going on in Havenbrook lately. There’s too much happening for it to be just coincidence.”

They all nodded in agreement, exchanging looks. Michelle spoke up, “We need to figure out what’s causing all this and how to deal with it.”

Tatum added, “The recent events are definitely connected. We need a plan if we want to get ahead of it.”

The conversation continued, ideas exchanged as they sipped on coffee and shared pastries. They all knew the stakes were high, but together, they felt more prepared to face whatever was coming.

# Shakira's Club

At Shakira’s club, the atmosphere was far more relaxed. The music was pumping, and C.C. was there, enjoying herself. She sipped on a drink as she leaned against the bar, chatting with Jazzy, who was also there, just chilling and taking in the scene.

“Nice to just take a breather, right?” Jazzy said, giving C.C. a smile.

“Definitely,” C.C. agreed. “Especially with all the chaos lately. It’s good to just... let loose a little.”

They clinked their glasses, both of them enjoying the moment of calm in the middle of everything that had been happening.

# Judy Álvarez's Place

Over at Judy Álvarez’s place, she and Alinity were spending time together, just enjoying each other's company. The two had grown close, and their bond was becoming stronger with each day. Judy still felt a little unsure about dating Alinity, nervous about taking that next step, but the way they clicked was undeniable.

They spent the evening laughing and talking, both happy just to be with one another.

# NJPW Style Wrestling Event

Judy Álvarez and Janie Styles had finally finished setting up the NJPW-style wrestling event. They were excited to see who would show up. Both of them knew that this event was not only a way to entertain but also a means to draw out people who they didn’t recognize—people who might be involved in the strange occurrences in Havenbrook.

# Alexa's Place

Alexa sat down with Hendra and Andreja once again, ready to continue their conversation. “Thanks for coming back, both of you,” Alexa said, giving them a warm smile. “I know last time was a lot, but it’s important for us to talk this through.”

Hendra nodded, and Andreja sighed, looking determined to continue their journey of healing.

“We're ready,” Andreja said, her eyes meeting Alexa’s. It was clear they were both committed to understanding their past and finding a way forward.

*The atmosphere across both Havenbrook and Havenbrook City was filled with tension, uncertainty, and hope, each group dealing with their own challenges, but all of them slowly working toward a common goal—to uncover the truth behind the chaos that had consumed their lives.*",1,1748054612.0,u_SilverEnd1208,0,1.0,False
1ku1cp6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ku1cp6,Nolli lived a great life,"This will be a lot of a rant. Not sure if it’s allowed here but I need to get this off of my chest. 

She was a rescue, one of our family dogs for 9 years. She came from a bad place, a breeder used her for litters only to throw her on the side of the street after. I remember the day she came home. She was so nervous, it took months but we were gentle and patient. It paid off so well. She was the most selfless dog I’ve ever met. So gentle and not a single drop of bad blood in her. We had so many adventures together. She was my escape and reason to get out of the house when I needed to. We’d go on walks or drives to the pond and my god did she love to swim. 

Her brother Macs passed in 2022. That was the single worst day of my life and I’ve been through a lot. He was my puppy, he was a rescue and a gift from my older sister, he was 10. Unfortunately the person who birthed me, let’s call her H, took away my grieving process from me. She hid his sickness and it took three years for me to find out he was cremated. I still don’t know where he is, I still can’t find a collar or tag of his for myself to hold onto. Monty was before, my true childhood dog. I was very young when he passed. He was sick and, you guessed it, she didn’t tell anyone until it was too late. 

Just quick context, I have no good history with H. She’s abused me all my life, I’ve never forgiven her for nor do I respect her. When she hid Macs from me…. I haven’t healed from it since. Don’t think I ever will. I never got to say goodbye. (Plus, she got a dog to “replace” him 4 months after. She swore he “sent her for H to heal” except her new dog Macy is the least like Macs and only caused a lot of problems in the house and family).

It’s relevant because she’s just done the same thing to me with Nolli. Luckily my father was there to tell me she was being rushed to the emergency vet. I woke up and it was the first thing I see, so I rushed out of the house (I live with my boyfriend now about 40-50 minutes away) and begged the entire time for her to confirm the hospital she was at. I cried the entire way there. She calls me when I’m 10 minutes away and tells me I have to say goodbye. 

The whole time there was horrible. I couldn’t grieve her, I couldn’t say goodbye. I spent any longer than 2 minutes holding Nolli, I’m being pushed away because it’s “her turn”. H didn’t even want to wait until my dad got there. I just wanted to hold her. The doctor comes in and explains to me why Nolli is here. Apparently my poor girl had cancer in her liver and she fell sick/limp that morning because of internal bleeding (?). Apparently H knew this for a week or two. She didn’t tell anybody, she didn’t accept medication for Nolli. She let her suffer during her last week. She knew and she didn’t tell me so that I could come home and spend her last days with her. Give her her last treat or peanut butter spoon. Last car ride to get coffee and a pup cup, last trip to the park, last bathe in the sun, cuddle, play, belly rub. It could have all been peaceful and scheduled for her. 

Nolli was being put down and H had her entire body wrapped around her the whole time, blocking me. I watched from a distance. I wanted to hold her too. I deserved to hold her too. I watched her eyes.

I’m sorry. I don’t mean to be so vulnerable. I had to sneak one of her collars home with me or else I wouldn’t have heard the end of it. God. I just can’t grieve right. I’ve been such a mess and it’s been a week. I can’t stop crying. I can’t stop being mad at H. I just don’t understand it. I feel forced to process through this anger before I can celebrate Nolli’s life. I just want to grieve. ",70,1748054533.0,dogpictures,3,0.99,False

No one on FB really cares about my hysterectomy. I don’t know anyone on there who gets the struggle to be listened to instead of dismissed, actually diagnosed and have a doctor willing to do a hysterectomy without a fight. I hope this helps someone in some way! If you are reading this because you are healing or you are scared to have a hysterectomy… you can do scary things. It will all work out in the end ❤️

4/23/25 - I made it through surgery. It was intense—truly unlike anything I’ve ever experienced. I’m sore, groggy, and in a lot of pain, but I’m alive ❤️Anesthesia felt like a fever dream, and I’m still not all the way here 😵‍💫🥴 Recovery is going to be a journey, and I’m just taking it one breath at a time. Grateful for the care I received and asking for prayers as I heal 🙏🏼

4/25/25 - ⚠️ Hysterectomy Recovery: Day 2 ⚠️

No amount of internet research—and I did a lot—could’ve prepared me for this pain. It feels like I’ve been cut in half, butchered, ripped open by a chainsaw. Everyone said the first two hours post-op were the most dangerous, and that I probably wouldn’t remember them. They were right—I don’t. Now I’m at the two-day mark. Still early, still vulnerable, still in absolute agony 😮‍💨 But, every day further out from surgery without suffering a risk or complication is a good day 🙌🏼

Is everything healing? God, I hope so. It feels like I’ve just been wounded, not recovering from one. Is the pain manageable? Barely. Percocet every four hours is just taking the edge off, but this is a type of pain I’ve never known before. On top of that, I’m fighting a fever, a urinary tract infection that started right after surgery, and thick phlegm from being intubated. Trying to cough that up to avoid pneumonia when your abdomen has been butchered is a nightmare 😩🥺

But… small victories. Urinary function has returned. I had my first bowel movement. I’m able to get out of bed, walk to the bathroom, and eat a little something. I can shower by myself. These are trophy worthy wins at this point 🏆

My 17-year-old daughter has been my angel. She slept beside me, woke up with me throughout the night, helped me in and out of bed, on and off the toilet, brought me meds, held my hand. I don’t have words for how grateful I am for her care and her presence 🩷

Please send prayers 🙏🏼 I feel absolutely wrecked, but I’m thankful for what I can do and the love that’s surrounding me. This is the hardest thing I’ve ever done physically—and I’m doing it 💪🏼

5/3/25 - First day outside since my hysterectomy, and there’s no better way to spend it than soaking up this Saturday with my girls. Grateful for healing, sunshine, and the sweet joy of being with them. I wasn’t sure we would be able to handle such a major surgery and recovery without another adult around to help us, but as always, we’re figuring it out together ❤️

5/4/25 - Sipping coffee while cooking breakfast this morning felt like a quiet miracle. I’m moving slower these days, healing with grace—but there’s something sacred about returning to the rhythm of feeding the people I love ❤️

5/7/25 - 💛 Two Weeks Post-Op 💛

I drove for the first time today. It wasn’t the most comfortable ride, but I did it, and I felt like me again while doing it 🥲

My pathology and follow-up with my doctor today confirmed what I already knew: it was never normal to live in that much pain. I had chronic cervicitis, cysts on everything, endometrial hyperplasia, adenomyosis, endometriosis, and pelvic adhesion disease. The silver lining? No cancer, and most of the organs causing my pain are now gone. That alone made every bit of this worth it 🙌🏼

The biggest post surgery risks are behind me. The pain is down to discomfort. My bladder and bowels work, thank God, but I’m still swollen, hormonal, and wiped out. I move slowly but frequently. The goal is still to rest and recover ❤️‍🩹

Also—fun fact: when your ovaries go into shock, no deodorant on Earth can help you 😅 I’m hoping that’s temporary🤞🏼

Healing is weird 🥴 It’s gross, hard, emotional, funny, and empowering all at once. But I’m doing it. Day by day 🙏🏼❤️

5/23/25 - 💛 One Month Post-Hysterectomy 💛

One month ago, I could barely move and didn’t know how I would survive the pain.

Today, I can bend down, sit in a chair, shave my legs, cook, walk semi long distances, and I’m back to working full-time. I feel like a warrior goddess 💪🏼

Recovery is lonely 😌 But here’s what I know: God carried me through it 🙏🏼 Prayer and Bible study kept me grounded when my body and mind were struggling ❤️

This is your reminder that you can do scary things. You can do the things that seem impossible at first 🙌🏼

One month down 🫱🏻‍🫲🏼

I’m still healing, still swollen, I get tired quickly, but I’m upright. I’m functioning. Things are improving by the day. I’m coming back to life ❤️‍🩹",6,1748054498.0,hysterectomy,0,0.81,False

I am still researching grinders, however I really like the look of this Astoria CKXE which I have found on marketplace. It appears to be in good quality. However I wasn't sure if this was a wise purchase given that age of the machine and my lack of experience (is this too much of a step up).

Does anyone have any experience with the reliability of these coffee machines? If any problems arise in the foreseeable future. How fixable would this be?

(Perhaps someone who struggles with fasts over 72 hours can benefit from my many experiments). 

So hold on to your depends and let me tell you what I found out a couple days back:

**My credentials:**  
Been fasting for 5 years on and off. (since 2020, thanks covid)  
Usually 3-5 day fasts. Longest fast was 6 days long.  
Done omad for years, done adf for months.  
I've rolled and unfold all the fasts. 

**During those extended fasts:**  
After day 3, life was always miserable: Horrible sleep. Cramping legs, low energy, low mood and awful hunger, always wanting to break after 72 hours, and pushing to get to 120).

  
**What's happening now?**  
Currently, I'm on day 7 of an open-ended fast, but... I'm feeling none of the above.

\-  On day 4 of this fast, I was feeling miserable - as usual- hungry and tired and I decided... why not add a little of ***milk*** to my coffee?

Lo and behold, it fixed everything. Zero hunger, zero misery. No cramps, good night sleep. Unheard of until now for a day 4 and beyond sleep.

  
Next day I felt perfect. Full of energy! (impossible!)  At night, I did the same, milk in coffee. The clarity of mind, energy and no-hunger continued. I don't know what to attribute this to. 

In the past, I had tried to extend fasts with vinegar, pickle juice, zero carb sodas (this is the worst idea ever for me), miso soup... unsuccessfully. Each of these would lead to 'ok, I'm hungry, let's eat'.

But milk... it fixed everything. 

I sleep well! No cramps! I have energy!

And YES, I take my electrolytes as recommended since always. In the past, I had up them a ton and nothing worked! I was always miserable by day 4. Before milk, I'd be cramping in the legs and having terrible sleep. Low energy, low mood. It never went away with just the electrolytes, coffee, vitamins, water and tea.

  
BTW -> We're talking 100-150ml of super low fat milk (around ***50-60 cals a day***), per day.

  
A few things I attribute this to:   
1. Phosphorus: For whatever reason, I can't find phosphorus as a supplement where I live and milk has phosphorus. Phosphorus is needed to make energy and what I'm having of milk is like 30% of the needed phosphorus per day (a lot more than the 0% my body had always gotten during fasts)

Alternatively, it's those 3g of carbs that go straight to the brain and other vital organs that can't feed off ketones.

So this is something ***between a dirty fast and a mimicking diet.*** (none of my vitamins have crazy calories, i don't take omega-3s . I did that in the past, it also didn't help.) I have maybe 20 cals of vitamins and 60 cals max from the milk per day)

  
The rest is normal: water, black coffee, tea, electrolytes as suggested.

  
I ALSO DON'T HAVE THE RUNS ANYMORE! You'd think the carbs in the milk would fuck you up? You would be wrong! I had a normal (NORMAL! but small) bowel movement after 2 days of the milk experiment.

Idk man, I feel like I've cracked a code. Found a magic key to extended fasting.

Life is good. If you struggle to extend your fast, can I recommend a little milk in your coffee before going to bed?

  
Also, if you have phosphorus in your vitamins, I would love to read in the replies what your experience with extended fasting has been. ",3,1748054337.0,fasting,8,0.8,False

I’m also posting because listening to her videos really helped me find my own closure & stop caring so much what others may think of this situation. I am changing names in this on the off chance someone I know reads it. Now buckle up cause this one is long & dramatic.

Background info: my best friend since 5th grade, let’s call her Becky & I have been through all the things together. We managed the weird transition from private school to public school together, we thankfully ended up at the same public high school. But we actually did not hang out at school together, like at all. We are so opposites attract type of friendship. Becky was the peppy extroverted cheerleader, while I was the quieter sporty one & did pretty much everything I could to not be in the popular crowd. She dated my brother fairly seriously in high school, that did NOT end well, but we still managed to keep our sister like friendship. She was there for me while I navigated getting married very young & being a military wife, she supported me when I became a mom. I gave her pep talks through the terrible dating & encouraged her in her schooling & later career goals. I drove 10 hours to spend a too short weekend with her when her mom passed far too young. She held my hand, wrote my bio, & took my pictures when I was finally ready to date again after a VERY messy divorce. In short we were each other’s rock. 

Fast forward to us as 28 year olds. It’s Halloween & unfortunately I am a last minute person (I know, believe me I have tried to change that, but I have now just accepted that that’s who I am). Becky being my best friend, she did a lot of holiday stuff with my daughter & I. So all 3 of us are running a quick errand at the store before getting ready for tick or treating with my then 6 year old. As we’re walking around the store looking for the things we need I notice a man following us, when I first noticed him I saw him say something to Becky. However my daughter & I were too far ahead of them to hear what he said. & at first he just walked by after he said something, but then he came back & started blatantly following us, saying things along the lines of they better get their stuff back. At this point I don’t remember exactly what was said, but I do remember it was language & things that I would not want my 6 year old to over hear. This man made it very clear he would be following us when we left. Somehow my daughter didn’t catch on, I will forever thank my lucky stars for me being able to make up stupid songs about whatever we’re doing because that was what kept her focus & entertained while this was happening. Now my dad was a cop, & while this was scary, I was raised both confident & competent. So when we got to the check out I informed Becky that she needed to talk to security at the store & call the police. That she would not be coming to my car with us because I would not be putting my daughter in danger like that, nor would I let him follow us to my house, but i told her that I wouldn’t leave until security was there. I told her to call me once the police had taken care of things & the man was gone. At this point I was completely clueless as to wtf was going on, but what I did know was I’d be damned if whatever it was would affect my daughter. So after all of this is taken care of & my kid is happily running from door to door getting as much candy as she can carry, Becky tells me her story. To this day I don’t know if this story is true, but I strongly suspect it’s not the whole truth. The man following us was an acquaintance of Becky’s ex. This particular ex & Becky were together for several years & they did a damn good job of just emotionally annihilating each other, both cheated & on & on. But not the point. The point is she was still friends with this ex. She had let him barrow her car at one point. & apparently when he had her car he decided to go to that acquaintance’s house & steal a whole bunch of stuff, like all the expensive tech things, big screen TV, stereo equipment, laptops, the works. Becky said she had no idea until the guy was following us around. At the time I took it at face value & commiserated on what a sh*t human being her ex is. But looking back she was careful to just say things like what a terrible thing for him to do & I don’t know what he was thinking. 
So I let this go & we continue on with life. Becky’s now dating someone new, they moved in together really quick if you ask me but she was happy so whatever right. So it’s summer, school is out & baby sitters are expensive. So Becky being the bestie babysits for me  as often as she can. Something comes up & she can’t babysit for me but she says the boyfriend is happy to do it. Now my daughter has met him several times & she seems to like him well enough, but I’m unsure cause that’s my baby. But I had to go to a gyno DRs appointment & that was not one I was willing to bring a curious 7 year old to. So I trust my best friend & have the boyfriend watch her. 
Now fast forward a few months & I buy a new car, & am selling my old one. The boyfriend wants to buy it so I say ok. I sign it over & I file the release of liability, this is important. 
Fast forward another few months & they’ve broken up & bestie is moving into a new place. She was stressed about the move because her deposit ended up being quite a bit more money than she had, I tell her I feel bad but unfortunately I can’t help as I didn’t have that much either & she already owed me some money, a few days later she’s fine & when I ask about it she says she’s figured it out. Ok cool whatever I’m glad it worked out. 
Now fast forward a few more months. I get a notice in the mail about my old car being impounded & owing a RIDICULOUS amount of money. So I’m confused & I call the number on the notice & in the end I just had to share the last known contact info I have for Becky’s ex & I’m off the hook because I had filed the release of liability. But I’m confused too, & I tell Becky about it, she reaches out to the ex but can’t get ahold of him. 
A few weeks pass & my dad calls me. In between the time we talked about the car issue & my dad calling I had learned more about what had been going on, enough to really see the puzzle pieces were not fitting, so I’m already uneasy with things. 
Now for my dad, he can be scary he’s a retired cop & you can tell, & my step mom is Italian & sweet until you mess with her loved ones. 
So dad calls & asks what I’m doing, as fate would have it I’m literally on my way to meet Becky for coffee. He asks where we are meeting because he needs to talk to her. So I tell him & he says don’t let her know I’m coming but I’ll meet you there. So we’re sitting outside with out coffee just chatting. When I see my dad heading our way I notice my step mom is also with him, & when Becky notices them coming her face drops. 
So they sit with us & confront Becky. Turns out the deposit money she didn’t have, she got the money from my dad with the caveat that she pays him back in full over the next month, so half of what’s owed from her each of her next 2 checks. As you can guess she did not pay him back. The main points of their convo, my dad telling her she will pay me back first cause what was she thinking borrowing money from a single mother, then she will pay him back, every pay check we get $200 until she has paid it all back or he would waste a few thousand dollars just to teach her the lesson the hard way by taking her to small claims court & making sure she got served while she was at work. My step mother made it clear in no uncertain terms that she was no longer welcome at their home for any reason other than dropping money off. They apologized to me for the surprise & left. 
So that left us in a quiet awkward silence for all for 30 seconds before I very calmly, with the quiet rage of a protective mother that should make people literally wonder if they will survive this encounter, demanded answers. Why didn’t she tell me she got money from my dad? ( which I will say girls got balls, cause honestly I would rather make money selling feet pics than ask my dad for money, the man is scary) I also demanded answers about the things that didn’t make sense. I never thought I’d be one of those people that says “how dare you” in an argument. But I definitely said how dare you put my daughter in potential danger. It turned out the ex that stole stuff, she was hanging out with him, had him in her car, while she was picking my daughter up from daycare & babysitters. & this was after the man following us, knowing that guy was on the lookout for her ex. She also shared that the more recent ex that I had let babysit my daughter, he was selling drugs, which she knew & did not tell me & that he was in jail & thats why the car was impounded. She also stated she was in gamblers anonymous & that’s why she was having so much money issues. She cried & wanted to know how to fix things. Assured me she would never hurt my daughter. I lost my sh*t, out of everything she said I only got excuses from her, she never apologized for what she did. I never thought she would hurt her, but driving around with a man who should have been in jail is her decision, but it is NOT her decision to make to drive around with him & my daughter in the car. I told her I couldn’t even begin to try to mend our friendship until she figured her sh*t out. 
 You would think that’s the end of the story. It’s not. 
A little over a year passes & I miss my best friend, so I reach out. We agree to meet for brunch & catch up. At brunch she looks so different, I mean she looks healthy & happy. She tells me how therapy has been going, she’s been going to gamblers anonymous regularly since we stopped talking, she’s started working out again & feels better than she has in ages. She’s talking to some of her family that she had always had a pretty rocky relationship with. All in all it seems like she really took everything that happened to heart & has been putting in the work to make herself better. & I’m ecstatic, we can start working on our friendship again. She also starts telling me she’s been seeing a new guy. This was a guy her mother had worked with & had tried to set her up with back when she was still alive. This man has not a job, but a career. He has goals & is actively working towards those goals. In short, the first man she’s actually dated & someone who can help lift her up & push her to do better. So time passes & our friendship is mending. My daughter is happy her Auntie Becky is back & watching them almost pee their pants laughing together while using the silly filters on Snapchat literally warmed my cold heart. As time passes her current boyfriend gets sent out of the country for several months for work. It’s rough but they are powering through, & I’m there with all the extra girl nights to help her through. Then one day she tells me she’s met another guy, & I warn her that nothing good will come of this & it’s a slippery slope back to bad choices. But she ends up cheating. The one she cheated with, she ends up dating, which again I caution her that nothing good will come because he knew she was in a relationship & pursued her anyway. But she’s happy & so far nothing else seems like she’s back to bad old habits so I speak my piece & move on. Months later the anniversary of her mother’s death comes around & he is supposed to spend it with her because she understandably is always really depressed around that time. He calls her in the middle of the night, literally the night before the anniversary, saying there’s a family emergency & he’s got to fly back home. She understands & I spend the time with her. Turns out there was no emergency, he went to HAWAII with another girl & cheated. Becky is devastated. Cuts him out & he is just nonstop trying to win her back. Showing up at her work unannounced bringing her coffee & snacks & anything he can to keep her mind on him. Eventually the trying to win her back seems to die down. & a few months later it’s her birthday. Now we still see each other all the time & are always talking. So I text her on her actual birthday to say happy birthday & ask what time she wants to go to dinner, taking each other on a birthday dinner date has looooong been our tradition. She responds that she’s out of town but will let me know as soon as she’s back. I’m surprised cause we had talked the other day & she didn’t say anything about going anywhere. So I ask something along the lines of oh last minute birthday trip, where did you go. & she tells me the cheaters hometown. So I responded with if you went with cheater’s name, I will disown you lol. Cause really, how could anyone have so little respect for themselves that they forgive someone skipping the anniversary of your mother’s death, just so they can go on a tropical vacation & cheat on you. Honestly I was half kidding when I said it, but there was a part of me that knew her forgiving him would be an issue. How could I want someone for my best friend that would treat her that way. Not to mention how much I hate cheating. But then she responded with that’s fine, I’m doing what makes me happy. & that was when I truly realized that our friendship never meant to her what it did to me. & that our opposites attract that made us so close when we were young, that for us it meant we had grown to be so different with different morals that we were no longer compatible as friends. & I haven’t spoken to her since. That text was about 4 years ago now. & I’ve often wondered if I was wrong. But therapy & listening to these stories has helped me get more clarity. I grieved that friendship more than I did my marriage. But in the end I know I’m better off, because my peace is too important to invite that kind of drama seeking toxicity into my life. I now choose to surround myself with people whose actions show me they are a good person, rather than holding onto what was simply because of the length of time spent with someone.

He must have open reddit in my computer. Pray for me that he doesn't find out.  
  
I know the tittle sounds dramatic but hear me out. I'm a 23 year-old non binary person that is a bit tired and anxious about their situation. For a bit of context; I'm just finishing a part of my studies and have to decide if I want to keep on going studying or if I wanna work. Lots of changes are going to happen and I'm starting to put my relationship in question...

I've been with the same guy for 4 and a half years, and our relantionship up to this point hasn't been bad, but maybe not as good as I always paint it. I do kinda feel stuck to him. He's a politician and has great grades in university, very admired in the comunities he participates in, some sort of prodogy some would say. I know he's looking for the same things in the future as me (House, marriage, kids...) and I value that 'cause is not that common to have it so crystal clear this days. He's a land owner and could easily get a good paying job in a couple of years, meaning that we could even think of moving in together while I'm still studying/I'm working a low paying job. Also, I'm afraid I might loose some closeness to my friends if I break up with him... We did in 2023 for a month and it was my lonliest time in a few years. He can be kind of needy and he basicly required our whole friend group 24/7.

As you can see, my ""reasons for staying"" are not the best. I want a good husband and I want to keep being close with my friends and all, but I'm so young... Maybe it feels like the life I have now would be destoyed but... Maybe it's fine? I've got time to rebuild it.

I do genuingly love him and enjoy his company a lot, we have a lot of taste in common, but he's the only bf I've had and I feel like my live is so much settled than what I want now. I wanna explore new people, new possibilities. He's also not the ""perfect boyfriend"", not that I am the perfect partner. He gets angry easily, sometimes agressive (he has never laid a finger on me if that is your concern), he's extremely jelous and a bit careless with my feelings. I usually think he's very inmmature for a guy in his position, his mother (who is a total demonic abuser, to be fair) still does everything for him: laundry, cleaning his room, making his meals... Even when he wants a coffee, he asks his mom. I just get the feeling my mother in law just goes along with this to keep him closer, so that she can play her mindgames, screaming matches and costant belitteling and insults. To sumorise, he doesn't make me feel loved, or heard, or important, nor desired... I'm just the doll he's suposed to flaunt in political gatherings and be at his side, always supportive but never asking to much from him.

Also, I'm getting the feeling his reactions to dissagriments and stuff are not that okay. Apart from the obvious agressive behaviour. Whenever I say I need to talk about something, whatever it may be, sometimes he isn't even involved, he always jumps to saying that I'm going to leave and starts acting sad and (I HATE to say it like this) like a ""victim"". English is not my first language. I sometimes try to break up with him, but he starts crying and begging, saying he's nothing without me and that he's gonna fall into depression. I admit I've wanted to leave before, but backed from it because of this. There's been times when he's physicly grabbed onto me, wich kind of scares me. He scares me a lot, actually. I've had a lot of bad expiriencies with men, especially sexual, physical and emotional abuse. I'm tall, but I'm really thin and he's taller, bigger, really strong actually. He's built like a tank tbh.

Why has this all come to a boiling point? Well, a couple of days ago we were ""play fighting"" and i tried to tickle him. He was already a bit steamy because of something that happened is his political life. He was doing his usual joke of pinning me down, saying that he's so much stronger than me and stuff (I'm not particularly bothered by it, it has acutally become even something sexual to us sometimes), and I tickled him. He flipped out. He even put his hand up and said that ""I will struck you"" as a way of telling me to stop. I froze. I got majorly triggered and he started to be very apologetic, but this has changed how I see everything. Like my mind is constantly running with the same ""He wouldn't... Would he?"". Logicly he wouldn't, but this has hurt me enough to not see logic.

Other relevant points that I don't know how to include:  
\- He's help me like no other with my mental health and stability, with my eating disorder too.  
\- He has gone to a therapist abour his anger management issues, but stopped going before he got everything under control.  
\- Lately, he's been very ocupied with his political career and has been ignoring me for the most part.  
\- He's insanely caring, very affectionate, encouraging, genuingly takes care of me.  
\- We are very compatible in bed and he's very comforting with my triggers and stuff during it.  
\- I do feel like he think highly of me, maybe too much. That is a mixed bag for me. On one hand, It's nice to have someone that loves you very much and speaks highly of you to others, but I do feel like he's obssesed sometimes.

Sorry if some points feel like contradictions, but I do feel the situations has a lot of those, wich doesn't help to navegate it. What should I do? And how? I just feel like no matter what I do I'm going to have to rebuild everything anyways, because if I stay with him, clearly it can't be like this.

In LF, we did the Mistico Hanging Bridges (guided tour), North Fields Coffee & Chocolate tour, and Eco Termales Hot Springs. Loved all three!

MA was much more laid back with two low key days sandwiching a day at MANP in between. We went with a guided tour for it as well.

For the time we had, it was perfect. I’m more of a laid back vacationer, so doing more activities in the beginning of the trip was nice. I honestly didn’t find any of where we went or what we did as too touristy. But we also did the earliest tours in the day and used week days for them as much as possible. 

The only downside of the trip was the first day because I have awful motion sickness. Our drive from San Jose to LF was so windy and bumpy. I had all of the medicines I could take, but I still had to get sick on the side of the road. Our trip from LF to MA was not great either, but it helped me to take meds an hour prior, keep an eye mask on, and lie down the entire ride.

The PB&J cups were atrocious and actually made me sick to my stomach. The ""jelly"" was not jelly at all, more like a sticky paste. It was one of the most artificial-tasting things I've ever eaten.

Last night, I saw Reese's Pieces Chocolate Bark in the store, so I decided to try it. The chocolate was downright terrible, again super cheap/artificial, and it didn't even seem like they used the normal Reese's Pieces in the bark. There was no peanut butter taste at all. Really bad product.

So now, to cap it off, I'm reading reviews on these new Peanut Butter Pie mini cups, and people are saying some wild stuff about them. They taste like coffee, black licorice, have a disgusting smell, among other things. I'm not even gonna bother trying them based off this.

I will say that the last new Reese's thing I had before these, the Chocolate Lava Cup, wasn't bad. Anyone have thoughts on these new products? Am I alone in thinking that Reese's is in danger of losing the plot here?",1,1748053437.0,candy,3,0.56,False
