I contemplated the news. Another woman dead, a Natalie Bodoway, dismembered in the streets of this godforsaken town. No prints, no witnesses, no noise. Her child is missing. I am beginning to not feel anything when I go to the scenes. I take a long drag from my cigarette that I bummed off my partner Carson. He gave me shit since I have been proclaiming ever since I found out my wife was pregnant that “I swear I’m gonna quit”; then proceed to smoke at any inconvenience. He was right though, before my kid is even here, I have already let them down. Some father I’ll be.

“So much for quitting ya dick!” Carson laughed.

“Oh fuck off, we are gonna be there awhile.” I replied with an emotionless faint smile.

“Yeah well, suppose you're right. If it’s anything like the last one, not much to look forward to.” Carson stated plainly, but I could see it on his face. It’s starting to weigh on him.

I should begin by explaining what my job is or was. I worked murders. Homicide for the police department in Billings Montana. Despite our smaller population compared to other cities, we have just as high of a murder rate per capita, up there with the likes of Chicago, Detroit, New York. It also happens to be the most depressed city in America, go ahead, look it up. It's because of the winters. The cold and what lies within the blizzard that can bring anybody down to their lowest point. We have a large Native American population in not only Billings, but all of Montana. Where I live in Billings, we have a large population of the Natives from the Crow tribe. The people in this tribe god bless them, walk around like they're already dead. They add to the suicide rate. Them along with the several drunk drivers. In Montana, if you aren’t a skier or really good at anything in particular, you drink during the winter. That makes me the most talentless motherfucker around. Comes with the job. Long nights, horrors that nobody should be exposed to, feeling alone. Anyway, enough about my shit, my point is people come to Montana to escape whatever demons that held onto them. Unfortunately for the unknowing, this place is where demons are born. As the years go by, the less good I see and what's in place instead, I’m afraid of.



Due to the road closures (A frequent occurrence in the winter), it took us even longer to get to the scene of the crime atop the Rim Rocks. The Rims are a plateau of sandstone rock that overlooks the city. Formed millions of years ago, it used to be the shoreline of an ocean. Remember the drunk drivers? Its a suicidal drunks wet dream. People throw themselves off multiple times per year. They also have a few caves that are hard to reach. Usually when troopers get called to the caves it is to break up huddles of homeless people, or if they are lucky and get to have some fun, the occasional cult. When we did arrive at the home, the environment sank everything in its path. The gravity held everyone down by the neck and would not subsist. An officer that went by Riggs met us when we got out of the car. Riggs informed us that the husband, a man named John Bodaway who had been staying at his brother's house called to request a wellness check on his wife because he hadn't heard from her for a week. They were separated for the last month, their six year old son was staying with his wife. Riggs went on to say that the Husband had an alibi everyday for the past two weeks and that he didn't suspect he had anything to do with it. The officer also said that the husband is on his way to the house to confirm the body belongs to his wife. We thanked Riggs but told him to keep the husband out of the house until we got everything we needed. We started towards the house. The door to the home was ripped off laying at the base of the porch. I shot a glance of shock to Carson. We ordered everyone to vacate the home so we could inspect the crime scene thoroughly. The house was clean, no smudges on the windows, dishes put away, not one speck of dust to be seen. The house only had two floors, the base floor where we were as we walked in, and the basement. We hesitantly made our way down the stairs. In the washer/dryer room there she was. A headless, limbless sack of flesh lay before us whose red ooze stained the carpet surrounding it. She had a black crow tattoo on her rib, a common tribe tattoo. Likely the only thing the husband will be able to use to identify the woman. The sack of flesh laid there with an eagle feather stabbed into her chest. The tears of flesh and marks around her neck, arms and legs looked like someone took a saw and slowly ripped into her piece by piece. Stunned, Carson and I both sat there for two minutes without a word, then finally:

 “Just like the last one” I whispered under my breath.

“Yep, looks like we got a serial killer and kidnapper on our hands. Two dead, two kids missing, same type of feather too.” Carson muttered.

“What in gods na–”

“No, God's dead.” Carson said sharply, cutting me off. I saw he was trying to hold it together as a single, somber tear ran down his cheek.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  


***PART TWO****:*

As we were wrapping up our notes in the basement, we heard shouting above.

“Husband, must be.” Carson stated.

“Want me to handle it?” I asked.

What people won’t tell ya in the movies is that this is always the hardest part of the job. No matter how desensitized the job becomes, telling innocent civilians they will never see their loved ones again will never become easier. In this case, even worse. The husband won’t even get to do an open casket at the funeral, and on top of that his son’s missing. Carson and I agreed to not tell him about the feather. Racism in this state has led to a lot of racially motivated murders and since his wife was a white woman we wouldn’t want him to blame himself for this crime.

“Yeah, fuck, could you get this one?” 

“Yeah I got you man” I replied.

As we made our way back upstairs, something caught my eye. A sharp tooth, covered in blood at the base of the stairs. I picked it up, observed it with Carson then put it in a zip lock bag to get analyzed by forensics. Once I placed it in the ziplock I noticed I nicked myself on the thumb and was bleeding. Maybe they have a pet I thought? Regardless it probably wasn’t going to come up with much. As soon as we turned the corner atop the staircase in the empty door frame was a man, presumably John Bodaway covered in dirt and grime being held back by Riggs and two other officers trying to keep him from entering.



“Ah shit, this one is gonna be rough.” I stated plainly. Carson just stared blankly to the ground not looking up to meet me or anybody else in the eye. I made my way over.

The man's bright red face looked as though the grief and anger were going to spill molten lava out of every orifice visible to the naked eye. In his blind rage and pain he began  shouting more once he saw us. 

“Where the fuck is my wife?! I refuse to believe that she's dead, where were you huh where the fuck were you?!”  The husband hollered.

I gestured to Riggs and his men to let him free and I approached the man. I stood face to face with a grieving husband. No matter what he says or does I can’t fault him because I’d want to kill anyone if anything like this happened to me and my family. 

“John Bodaway? I work homicide. I am Detective Ralph Irons. I can’t imagine what your going through right now but–”. John punched me squarely in the jaw causing some blood to drop on the spotless flooring. 

“Fuck you pig! Spouting your rehearsed lines, fuck that. Tell me something useful or get the fuck out after I look at the corpse you claim is my wife. And where is my boy?” He began to cry.

Riggs and his men began to rush towards John and I waved them off. Not wanting to punish this defeated man more than he has already been punished by God and on top of it, they were rehearsed lines. What is this job turning me into? I grabbed him from the top of his shirt below his neck and swore to him. 

“John, we are going to help you. I am sorry. And I swear to you, I will find your boy. From one father to another I won’t rest till we bring whoever did this to justice.” 

	John looked at me, the pain in his eyes were palpable, he nodded at me. Once I let go of him I asked him if his wife had a black crow tattoo on her ribs. As soon as the words left my mouth his anger washed off his face in an instant and only anguish remained. He confirmed that it was his wife. I said right now we didn’t have any solid leads or much evidence but since this has happened once before, hopefully the department will give us more time and resources will be used towards finding the killer and his son.

“Can I see her? Can I please see my wife's face? I want to apologize to my wife for all my mistakes.” John pleaded. 

I told John he shouldn’t go down there. I had to tell a father his son was missing and his wife was dismembered in his own home, regardless if they were separated I can only imagine what he’s going through. After I explained why he couldn't, John collapsed to the ground and started wailing on the hardwood floor till his knuckles were bloodied. Carson was in the corner of the kitchen with his head down. 

When tensions lowered, Police escorted John back to his brother's house, afraid of him driving himself. I made sure to get John’s contact information before he left and I promised him I will give him a call If Carson and I get any leads. When everyone had left Carson walked up to me.

“Thanks for taking that punch for me.” With a light smirk.

“Yeah no problem, want to go get a drink? I could use something for the pain, that big Indian sure can throw a haymaker” I laughed as much as someone could laugh at a moment like this. How else could anyone make it through a job like this without trying to laugh instead of actually thinking about all the horror? I lied to Carson, the punch didn’t hurt that bad. I just wanted to blur the image of John’s wife, or whatever was left of her out of my mind.

“Yeah sure, I could use one too.” Carson replied.

The car ride after the bar was silent. The type of silence that's deafening. No amount of alcohol was gonna permanently erase what we both saw that night. Where did that fucking kid go? Despite driving well beyond the legal limit I made it back to the station where we dropped off the tooth to be processed by Kim at forensics. When I parked the car outside of Carson's car, Carson looked at me and paused before stating,



“ You know you shouldn’t have lied to him. You promised him you’d find the boy. We have no leads, and the kid from two weeks ago has no trace either. Remember the only reason we even suspected Tallulah Birdinground of having a kid was the walker next to her corpse at the park. We have jack shit.”

“ I know, but if I was in John’s shoes right now, I’d prefer to be lied to.”

“See ya tomorrow”, Carson left.

	Cognitive dissonance can be defined as mental discomfort from two or more conflicting attitudes, beliefs, and feelings. That is what it is like coming home to my wife Khalyn after work. To pretend everything is okay when I haven’t felt okay for a long time. Being married to a cop isn’t a walk in the park but she made it seem that way. She loved me despite the late nights, despite the nightmares, despite the alcohol on my breath. I didn’t deserve her. I came home at 1 in the morning and she had her bed side lamp on and waited for me to come home. Her growing excitement for the baby, and I was emotionally unavailable. I have had so much fear of bringing a child into this world. Ever since Keenan.

“ How was work, my love?” She asked innocently.

	She was the only person in this whole world I could melt to from just her words. I began to weep. I told her I couldn’t talk to her about it until I was ready but she understood. She understood me completely. I kissed her goodnight and flipped to my side, tears down my cheek, the stench of black coffee, a cigarette, and five Moscow mules still on my tongue. I passed out. 

I had a dream last night. I have a unique ability to remember my dreams and I make it a habit to write down what I dreamt of as soon as I wake up. It plays like a movie in my head. I was falling, falling off a cliff into snow. When I hit the ground I didn’t wake up like I normally would in dreams where I fall. I couldn’t move, what appeared as red blood spread through the snow surrounding me. I felt warm. In the distance I saw someone or something, on all floors slowly crawling toward me. Simultaneously I heard singing, a chant-like rhythm that vibrated my ears. Children's voices sang the toon. Before I could see what was approaching me I woke up. To my knowledge this is what the children sang.



*“Oh, Red Woman, child of the flame,*

*Cloaked in silence, never speak her name.*

*In the wind she is dancing, in dreams she is near,*

*A warning, a whisper, a shadow of fear.”*



The phone rang at 7 AM. It was forensics. They got the lab results back from the tooth.

“Ralph, The blood on the tooth did belong to Natalie Bodaway. However, we are a bit confused.” Kim stated.

“What about?” I replied

“The tooth you gave us, we tried to age the tooth to get an idea of roughly how old the suspect would be. We weren’t able to connect it to any DNA in any of our records. So we tried radiocarbon dating. From our estimates, the tooth you gave us came from someone who likely would have died 400 years ago.”

I wanna make sure it extra extra clean before I use it for the first time. Could someone also pls tell me what kind of discreet storage I can use to keep it clean but also hidden from my family? 

In return, I'll give you my daddys instructions on how to make yummy powdered milk angel milkys :3

In a microwave safe jug, add some water, enough to fill your favourite sippy cup/bottle, or reusable coffee cup if your closeted like me. For example, 300ml-300ml and 1/2 is enough to fill mine. (reusable coffee cups make good sippys for closeted littles. Trust me!!) 

Next, add about 1/4 cup powdered milk or more/less depending on how big your sippy cup/bottle is. I use a little scoop and add about 3 and a half scoops. 

Now, mix it all around with a big spoon until the powder has dissolved into all the water. 

Once it's dissolved, add a table spoon of sugar (white, raw or whatever you prefer/have at home. Honey is also a good alternative) then about a capful of Vanilla extract/essence (alcohol free) about a teaspoon or 1/2 teaspoon depending on your preference. 

Mix it all together, then microwave for 30 seconds to a minute or minute and a half depending on your temperature preference. (these are for a 1000w microwaves. If you have more or less, you may need to adjust depending)

Once it's done, mix it around again to make sure the sugar dissolves properly.

And then, pour it into your sippy/bottle and TADAAA yummy powdered milk angel milkys!!! ",2,1759978093.0,ageregression,0,1.0,False

1o1utbl,https://i.redd.it/6lno1blp10uf1.png,Wife Unveils Husband's Lies,"Chapter 1

The morning sun streamed through our bedroom window, casting golden light across the mahogany dresser where Ricardo had left his briefcase. Ten years. A decade of marriage, of love, of sacrifices I'd made willingly for the man I thought cherished me. I ran my fingers over the leather case, remembering how I'd surprised him with it on our fifth anniversary.

""I'll make coffee,"" I whispered to myself, slipping out of bed. Ricardo had already left for work—another early meeting, he'd said. Another late night ahead.

While waiting for the coffee to brew, I noticed his briefcase slightly open. A folder peeked out, marked ""Plaza Manhattan—Anniversary Celebration."" My heart skipped. Was this his surprise? The one he'd been hinting at for weeks?

I shouldn't have looked. Some part of me knew that. But ten years deserved trust, didn't it? I slid the folder out, expecting to find reservation confirmations or perhaps a list of musicians for a private concert.

Instead, my hands trembled as I stared at hotel receipts for the Plaza Manhattan's penthouse suite. Not for tonight—our anniversary—but for last night. And the night before. And every night this week.

""Champagne: Dom P�rignon, 3 bottles @ $750 each...""

""Diamond necklace from Tiffany & Co.: $42,500...""

""Private dinner for two with Executive Chef: $5,200...""

My coffee mug slipped from my fingers, shattering on the tile floor. The brown liquid pooled around my bare feet, hot but not as scalding as the betrayal burning through my chest.

The dates. The extravagant expenses. None of it made sense until I saw the name scrawled on the bottom of one receipt: ""Aisha Robinson.""

My hands shook as I pulled out my phone, searching for images of Aisha Robinson. The search results loaded slowly, each second stretching like an eternity. Then her face appeared—beautiful, confident, her hand resting possessively on Ricardo's arm at a charity gala I hadn't attended because Ricardo had insisted I stay home with a headache.

""Aisha Robinson, Ricardo Olson's longtime companion...""

The words blurred as tears filled my eyes. Longtime. How long? One year? Five? Had our entire marriage been a lie?

I called my mother, my voice breaking as I explained. ""I need you to come with me,"" I whispered. ""I can't face this alone.""

Two hours later, we stood in the opulent lobby of the Plaza Manhattan. Mother squeezed my hand, her knuckles white with tension. ""Are you sure about this, Luna?""

""No,"" I admitted. ""But I need to know.""

The hotel buzzed with weekend elegance—women draped in designer dresses, men in tailored suits, champagne flutes clinking at the bar. And then I saw them.

Ricardo stood near the reception desk, his back straight, his dark hair perfectly styled. Beside him, Aisha Robinson laughed, her head thrown back to expose the elegant line of her throat—adorned with a diamond necklace that caught the light with every movement. At their feet, a boy of about seven or eight fidgeted with an expensive-looking toy.

""Is that—?"" my mother started.

""Yes,"" I whispered. ""That's Hayes. His son.""

The boy looked up then, his eyes—so like Ricardo's—catching mine across the lobby. His lips curled into a sneer that seemed practiced beyond his years.

""Look, Mommy,"" he said loudly, pointing at me. ""That lady looks like our cleaning lady. The one who smells funny.""

Aisha's eyes followed her son's finger, landing on me with cold recognition. She whispered something to Ricardo, who turned slowly.

For a moment, our eyes met. Ten years of memories flashed between us—promises made and, apparently, broken. His expression shifted from shock to calculation in the space of a heartbeat.

""Luna,"" he said, his voice carrying across the lobby. ""What are you doing here?""

""I could ask you the same thing,"" I replied, my voice steadier than I felt. ""On our anniversary, no less.""

Confusion rippled through the nearby guests. Ricardo's jaw tightened, and then he did something I never expected.

""I'm sorry,"" he said loudly, addressing the curious onlookers rather than me. ""This woman is... confused. She's just a cleaning lady who's been stalking me for months.""

The lobby fell silent. Aisha's lips curved into a triumphant smile.

""Ricardo,"" I whispered, disbelief making my voice crack. ""How dare you—""

""How dare I what?"" he snapped, his public mask slipping. ""You're embarrassing yourself. Go home.""

Hayes stepped forward then, his small face twisted with malice beyond his years. ""You're not allowed here,"" he hissed, and before anyone could react, he shoved my mother hard.

She stumbled backward, her hip connecting with the marble floor with a sickening thud. Her cry of pain echoed through the silent lobby as she lay there, one hand pressed to her side, the other reaching for me.

""Mother!"" I screamed, dropping to my knees beside her.

Hotel security materialized around us, their hands gripping my arms as I tried to reach her. Through tears of rage and grief, I saw Ricardo turn away, Aisha's arm sliding possessively through his as they walked toward the elevators.

""Get them out of here,"" someone ordered, and I felt myself being dragged toward the exit, my mother's whimpers of pain following me like an accusation.

In that moment, something inside me hardened. The Luna who had loved Ricardo Olson died on the cold marble floor of the Plaza Manhattan. In her place rose someone new—someone who would make them all pay for what they'd done today.

Chapter 2

The lobby fell silent as the revolving doors swung open. A tall figure entered, his military dress uniform immaculate, rows of medals gleaming beneath the chandeliers. My brother's presence commanded attention without a single word—his posture rigid, his eyes scanning the room with practiced precision. Behind him, two security personnel in dark suits flanked his entrance, their movements synchronized and purposeful.

I was still on my knees beside Mother, whose face had gone pale with pain. The hotel security guards still gripped my arms, but their hold loosened as they noticed the sudden change in atmosphere.

""Sir!"" The hotel manager—Victoria Hayes according to her nametag—rushed forward, her face transforming from contempt to obsequiousness in an instant. ""What an honor—""

My brother's gaze swept past her, finding me across the lobby. Something in his expression shifted—a flash of fury quickly masked by cold control.

""Release her,"" he ordered, his voice carrying effortlessly across the marble floor. ""Now.""

The guards holding me exchanged uncertain glances.

""I said, release my sister."" This time, steel edged his tone.

Sister. The word hung in the air like a thunderclap.

Ricardo's face drained of color. He stood frozen, Aisha's arm still looped through his, Hayes half-hiding behind them. I watched as recognition dawned in his eyes—the same nose, the same chin, the same proud bearing that had marked our family for generations.

""Colonel King,"" Victoria stammered, her hands trembling as she smoothed her skirt. ""We had no idea—""

""Clearly."" My brother's gaze swept over Mother's prone form, then to me, taking in my disheveled appearance and tear-stained cheeks. ""My sister and mother were just assaulted in your establishment.""

""Assaulted?"" Victoria's voice rose in panic. ""Sir, there must be some mistake—""

""No mistake."" My brother's security team had already positioned themselves strategically around us. ""The security footage will confirm everything.""

Ricardo stepped forward, his face a mask of forced calm. ""Colonel King, I assure you this is all a misunderstanding—""

""Is it?"" My brother turned slowly, studying Ricardo with the same clinical detachment he might give a tactical map. ""I believe you just publicly denied your marriage to my sister. In front of witnesses.""

The lobby had gone completely still. Even the staff pretending to busy themselves at the edges of the room had stopped to watch the unfolding drama.

""Ricardo,"" my brother continued, his voice dropping to a dangerous quiet, ""you have precisely thirty seconds to explain why you've been living off my sister's family connections while treating her like a servant.""

Ricardo's mouth opened and closed. For the first time since I'd known him, he seemed at a loss for words.

""Luna,"" he finally managed, reaching into his pocket. ""This was all a terrible mistake. I was going to surprise you tonight—""

He pulled out a small velvet box and opened it with trembling fingers. Inside nestled a diamond ring that caught the light in dazzling rainbows. Beside it, he produced a delicate silver bracelet studded with sapphires.

""Ten years,"" he said, his voice taking on that persuasive tone I'd once found so charming. ""We've had our differences, but I never meant—""

I rose to my feet, ignoring the pain in my knees where they'd pressed against the cold marble. Mother's hand found mine, squeezing gently.

""Take it,"" she whispered. ""And then throw it in his face.""

I took the ring box and the bracelet. For a moment, Ricardo's eyes lit with hope—that familiar spark I'd once treasured.

""This,"" I said clearly, so everyone could hear, ""is what you think my dignity is worth.""

I opened my fingers. The ring box fell first, hitting the marble with a sharp crack. The diamond popped free, skittering across the floor like a fallen star. The bracelet followed, silver links scattering.

""Our marriage,"" I continued, my voice steady despite the storm raging inside me, ""is over.""

Ricardo stared at the scattered jewelry, his expression shifting from shock to desperation. Around us, phones were already capturing every moment of his humiliation.

""Luna,"" he pleaded, reaching for my hand. ""Please—""

I stepped back, positioning myself beside my brother. The message was clear: I was no longer alone.

""Get your things,"" I said. ""And get out of my life.""

As Ricardo's world crumbled around him, I felt something unfamiliar stir within me—not satisfaction, not yet. But the first fragile seed of what might someday grow into freedom.

Chapter 3

The morning light filtered through the blinds of my home office as I arranged the financial documents on my mahogany desk. Each page represented a piece of the puzzle I'd been quietly assembling for years—every transaction, every favor, every connection I'd provided to build Ricardo's empire.

I heard his key in the lock and straightened my spine. The door swung open, revealing my husband of ten years. His confident smile faltered when he saw me waiting.

""Luna,"" he said cautiously, ""I didn't expect you to be here.""

""I've been waiting for you,"" I replied, my voice steady. ""We need to talk.""

Ricardo loosened his tie, his eyes darting to the stack of papers before me. ""About yesterday—""

""About everything,"" I interrupted. ""Please, sit down.""

He hesitated before taking the chair across from me. I could see the calculation behind his eyes—assessing, planning, wondering how much I knew.

""I think it's time you understood exactly what you're losing,"" I said, sliding the first document toward him.

Ricardo glanced down at the paper, his brow furrowing slightly. ""What is this?""

""A complete accounting of every marital asset you've diverted to Aisha over the past eight years,"" I said, watching his face carefully. ""Every piece of jewelry, every designer outfit, every vacation. All paid for with our money.""

I pushed another document forward. ""And this is a list of every business deal I helped you secure through my connections.""

His eyes widened slightly. ""Your connections?""

""Yes,"" I said, allowing myself a small smile. ""Did you think those lucrative contracts with defense contractors just fell into your lap? Or that your company's IPO succeeded because of your charm alone?""

I slid forward a third document—a detailed organizational chart. ""This shows every person in your professional network who owes their position to my family's influence. Every door I opened for you.""

Ricardo's face had gone pale. He stared at the papers, then back at me. ""Luna, I didn't realize—""

""That I was more than just a supportive wife?"" I finished for him. ""That I've been quietly building your success while you took all the credit?""

He reached for my hand, but I pulled away. ""Don't touch me.""

""I want a divorce,"" I said, my voice cutting through the silence. ""And I want every marital asset returned immediately.""

Ricardo's expression shifted from shock to calculation. ""Luna, be reasonable. We can work through this.""

""Forty-eight hours,"" I said firmly. ""You have forty-eight hours to recover every gift, every piece of jewelry, every cent you've given to Aisha. Or I'll take you to court.""

""You can't—""

""I can,"" I interrupted. ""And I will.""

A knock at the door interrupted us. My brother entered, his military bearing evident even in casual clothes. He nodded to me before turning his cold gaze to Ricardo.

""Colonel King,"" Ricardo stammered, rising quickly.

""Mr. Olson,"" my brother replied coolly. ""I believe my sister has made her position clear.""

He pulled out his phone, tapping the screen. ""I've just made a few calls to ensure that Luna's legal team receives full cooperation from all relevant parties.""

The threat was clear—my family's influence would ensure Ricardo couldn't hide anything.

Ricardo's phone rang suddenly. He glanced at the screen and his face tightened. ""It's Aisha,"" he muttered.

""Answer it,"" I suggested. ""Tell her the truth.""

He did, stepping away from the desk. ""Aisha, we need to talk,"" he began, his voice tense.

I watched as his expression changed from controlled to desperate. ""No, you don't understand. Luna knows everything. She wants everything back.""

My brother stood beside me, his presence a silent reminder of the power I'd never needed to use—until now.

""She's threatening legal action,"" Ricardo continued, pacing the room. ""If you don't return everything, we could both lose everything.""

I could hear Aisha's voice rising from the phone, though I couldn't make out her words.

""No, I'm not choosing her over you,"" Ricardo insisted, his free hand running through his hair. ""Aisha, please—""

A crash echoed through the phone, followed by a child's scream. ""You promised me!"" Hayes shouted. ""You promised I could have the new gaming system!""

""See what you've done?"" Aisha hissed. ""Our son is upset!""

Ricardo's face contorted with frustration. ""This isn't about gifts anymore! Luna is demanding everything back!""

Another crash, louder this time. ""No!"" Hayes screamed. ""You can't take my stuff! I'll tell Mom about what you did with that woman from your office! And about the money you stole from the company!""

Ricardo's eyes widened in panic. He glanced at me, then quickly away.

""Hayes, stop it!"" Aisha shouted in the background. ""Don't you dare threaten your father!""

But the damage was done. I'd heard enough to know that Ricardo's carefully constructed world was beginning to crumble—just as mine had when I discovered his betrayal.

And this was only the beginning of my revenge.",1,1759977886.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

# Espresso Basics

Understanding espresso basics is key to making great iced coffee. Espresso is a strong coffee brewed by forcing hot water through finely-ground coffee beans. This process extracts rich flavors quickly. A good espresso shot is the foundation of delicious iced coffee. Follow simple steps to get the best results.

# Choosing The Right Beans

Start with fresh, high-quality beans. Look for beans labeled “espresso roast” or medium to dark roast. These beans have a bold flavor and good crema. Use beans roasted within the last two weeks. Store them in an airtight container to keep freshness. Fresh beans give your iced coffee a richer taste and aroma.

# Grinding For Espresso

Grind size is crucial for espresso. Use a fine, consistent grind, like table salt texture. Too coarse grind makes weak espresso. Too fine grind causes bitter taste and slow extraction. Use a burr grinder for even grind size. Grind just before brewing to keep flavor fresh.

# Pulling The Perfect Shot

Use about 18-20 grams of coffee for a double shot. Tamp the grounds evenly with firm pressure. Lock the portafilter in the machine. Start the extraction and aim for 25-30 seconds brew time. The espresso should be thick, with golden crema on top. A perfect shot balances bitterness and sweetness, enhancing your iced coffee.

# Preparing Ice And Glassware

Preparing ice and glassware is a key step in making the [best iced coffee](https://gomehedi.com/best-iced-coffee/) with an espresso machine. The right ice keeps your coffee cold without watering it down too fast. Choosing the perfect glass enhances the look and feel of your drink. These simple details make a big difference in your coffee experience.

# Using Ice Cubes Vs Coffee Ice Cubes

Regular ice cubes cool your coffee quickly but melt fast. This can dilute the rich espresso flavor. Coffee ice cubes are made by freezing brewed coffee. They keep your drink cold without losing taste. Using coffee ice cubes is a smart way to keep every sip strong and fresh.

# Selecting The Ideal Glass

Pick a glass that fits your iced coffee style. Tall glasses hold more ice and espresso. They give room for milk or cream too. Clear glass shows off the beautiful layers of your drink. Thick glass keeps your coffee colder longer. Choose a glass that feels good in your hand and suits your serving style.

# Brewing Espresso For Iced Coffee

Brewing espresso for iced coffee requires attention to detail. The espresso shot forms the base of the drink. It must be strong and flavorful to stand up to the ice and milk. Preparing the perfect espresso shot ensures a rich, satisfying iced coffee experience.

# Adjusting Shot Strength

Start by using a slightly stronger espresso shot than usual. This prevents the flavor from becoming weak when poured over ice. Increase the coffee grounds slightly or use a finer grind. Avoid over-extracting, which can cause bitterness. Aim for a balanced, bold shot that complements the cold drink.

# Timing And Temperature Tips

Extract espresso quickly but fully, about 25 to 30 seconds per shot. Use water heated to around 90 to 96 degrees Celsius (194 to 205 degrees Fahrenheit). Avoid using water that is too hot, as it can burn the coffee. Brew espresso immediately before pouring over ice to keep it fresh and hot. This helps preserve aroma and flavor in your iced coffee.

# Combining Ingredients

Combining ingredients is key to making the best iced coffee with an espresso machine. This step controls the flavor, texture, and temperature of your drink. Each ingredient adds a unique touch that makes your iced coffee special and refreshing.

Careful mixing ensures the espresso stays strong and the drink remains cool. The right balance between espresso, ice, milk, and sweeteners creates a smooth and enjoyable coffee experience. Let’s explore how to combine these ingredients perfectly.

# Pouring Espresso Over Ice

Brew fresh espresso using your machine. Use one or two shots for a strong base. Fill a glass with plenty of ice cubes. Pour the hot espresso slowly over the ice. This cools the espresso fast and locks in the flavor. Avoid stirring immediately to keep the temperature low. The contrast between hot espresso and cold ice gives a rich taste without dilution.

# Choosing Milk And Alternatives

Select cold milk or milk alternatives to add creaminess. Whole milk offers a rich texture and mild sweetness. For lighter options, try skim milk or almond milk. Oat milk works well for a smooth, slightly sweet flavor. Pour the milk gently over the iced espresso. Stir slowly to blend the layers without melting the ice too fast.

# Adding Sweeteners

Add sweeteners to taste for a balanced flavor. Simple syrup dissolves quickly in cold drinks. Honey or agave syrup provide natural sweetness and distinct taste. Use sugar sparingly, as it may not dissolve well in cold coffee. Mix sweeteners into the espresso before pouring over ice for better blending. Adjust the amount to keep your iced coffee smooth and enjoyable.

# Flavor Enhancements

Enhancing the flavor of your iced coffee transforms a simple drink into a delightful experience. Small additions create big changes in taste. Experimenting with different flavor enhancers adds variety and fun. These tweaks let you enjoy your iced coffee exactly how you like it. Below are some easy ways to boost your iced coffee flavor using common ingredients.

# Syrups And Extracts

Syrups add sweetness and unique flavors to your iced coffee. Vanilla, caramel, and hazelnut syrups are popular choices. Add a small amount to your espresso before pouring over ice. Extracts like almond or peppermint provide a subtle taste boost. Use extracts sparingly to avoid overpowering the coffee. These liquid flavorings mix easily and blend well with cold milk or cream.

# Cream And Ice Cream Options

Cream makes iced coffee rich and smooth. Heavy cream or half-and-half work well for a creamy texture. For a treat, add a scoop of vanilla or coffee ice cream. This creates a delicious iced coffee float. Non-dairy creams like coconut or oat cream offer dairy-free alternatives. Whipped cream on top adds extra indulgence and visual appeal.

# Spices And Toppings

Spices bring warmth and depth to iced coffee. Cinnamon, nutmeg, or cocoa powder sprinkle nicely on top. A pinch of sea salt can enhance the coffee’s sweetness. Crushed nuts or chocolate shavings add crunch and flavor. Fresh mint leaves offer a refreshing twist. These toppings make every sip more exciting and enjoyable.

# Stirring And Serving

Stirring and serving iced coffee made with an espresso machine is a crucial step. It blends flavors and cools the espresso perfectly. Proper stirring ensures a balanced taste without watering down the coffee. Serving it right adds to the overall experience. Let’s explore effective mixing methods and smart serving ideas.

# Mixing Techniques

Stir gently to avoid breaking ice cubes. Use a long spoon or straw for better reach. Stir until the espresso cools and mixes well with milk or sweetener. Avoid shaking as it can create unwanted foam. For richer flavor, stir in syrup or cream before adding ice. Cold milk or cream helps keep the drink chilled longer.

# Serving Suggestions

Choose a tall glass to hold plenty of ice. Add a straw for easy sipping. Garnish with a small mint leaf or a cinnamon stick for aroma. Serve immediately to enjoy the freshest taste. Use clear glasses to show the beautiful coffee layers. Offer sugar or sweetener on the side for personal taste.

# Portable Iced Coffee Tips

Use an insulated tumbler to keep coffee cold on the go. Freeze coffee cubes to avoid dilution in portable cups. Prepare espresso shots in advance and store in a sealed container. Carry small bottles of milk or creamer separately. Stir well before drinking to mix all flavors evenly. Portable iced coffee stays fresh longer with these simple steps.

# Advanced Tips

Advanced tips help you elevate your iced coffee with an espresso machine. These techniques refine flavor and texture. They bring out the best in every cup.

Try these tricks to customize your iced coffee exactly how you like it. Small changes make big differences.

# Using Ristretto Shots

A ristretto shot uses less water than a regular espresso shot. This makes the coffee richer and more intense. It adds a bold flavor to your iced coffee. Use ristretto shots for a deeper taste without extra bitterness. Perfect for those who prefer strong coffee with a smooth finish.

# Cold Milk Sweetness Adjustments

Cold milk can taste less sweet than warm milk. Adjust sweetness by choosing milk types with natural sugars, like oat or almond milk. Add syrups or simple syrup to the cold milk before pouring. Stir well to mix sweetness evenly. This method keeps your iced coffee balanced and tasty.

# Experimenting With Coffee-to-milk Ratios

The coffee-to-milk ratio changes the strength and creaminess of your drink. Start with equal parts espresso and milk. Adjust to find your perfect balance. More coffee means stronger flavor. More milk creates a smoother, lighter taste. Test different ratios to suit your mood and taste buds.

This isn’t that serious, and I fear I may just be avoiding necessary conflict.
I(18f) am in my first term of college. My roommate (also 18f) and I were assigned together via random selection. Our room is small. I'm in the room most of the day while she only comes back at night.

I first want to say we made a ‘roommate contract’ where we sated we would keep our respective sides of the dorm clean, taking our trash as needed, etc. I specified taking food trash out immediately and avoiding strong smells as such. she brought a coffee maker, and i had asked her not to make it in the room as the smell upsets me (I am sensitive to strong odors such as food and coffee.)  she had mentioned making it instead in the shared kitchen downstairs, which I said was a good idea and would work best. 
I discussed the issues with her being messy before with my RA and she told me that if it’s not resolved to come talk to her. 

Over the first few weeks of the term, I have been keeping my side of the dorm clean, taking out the trash, doing laundry, taking care of dishes, and overall keeping my things organized. I clean as I go. My roommate however, cleans once a week. Her laundry piles up on the floor (I have a laundry bin), she leaves dishes sitting for days, and worst of all leaves food trash. Three times so far she has placed a pizza box in the room and let it sit there for a week each. The third time I made sure I reminded her that I do not like having food trash in our room, and it was stinking up the place. 

This week it happened again. I came back from visiting home over the weekend to find her side a mess. Dirty dishes were lying out, empty cans, and a half eaten snack bar in the wrapper on the floor. her trash was overfilled, and a takeaway container was sitting next to it in a bag. I had noticed some of her trash in my bin when I came back as well. Small things like a tag and tooth flossers, but still in my trash can while she has her own.
On Monday morning, (or Sunday, I can’t remember), she made coffee. That cup, coffee, creamer, and all were left to sit on her desk all the way through today (Wednesday), when she finally tidied up her side of the room. 

This morning she also made coffee, which I noticed way more than I did Monday. It was strong. I had been sleeping in as class had been canceled and I had trouble sleeping the past night. I was rudely awoken to the pungent smell of coffee. I didn’t say anything as it was early morning, but I struggled to go back to sleep. 

Tonight, when she finally cleaned the room she put more coffee powder into her machine. I don’t want to have to deal with that smell anymore. I’ve already told her once that the smell bothers me, and twice that the trash bothers me. This is a shared space, and I’m not feeling respected in it.

1o1ulki,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o1ulki,what is this resilient ass plant !!!!,"So my college roommate had this plant for four years and rarely watered it (there was one summer where we were all out of the house and it was still alive when we came back) and before we graduated I asked to cut off one of the stems to see if I can propagate it. Now I knew nothing about propagation and I kind of just snipped off a stem without the node and placed it in this plastic coffee cup. When I showed it to my dad who keeps a lot of house plants he said that it will probably die in a few weeks because what I’ve done is akin to putting a cut flower in a vase🥲 I kind of just said oh well and kept it for as long as I could and four months later the plant was still green when my apartment caught on fire, and miraculously, she still lives !! We found her covered in soot and saw that not only she has stayed alive while my other house plants died, but she has finally started growing roots after 6 months ? My dad calls it a lucky plant and says I need to upgrade it from its ugly cup into a real jar which I plan on doing. I have her set up on a sunny windowsill now in my new apartment and am hoping for more root growth in the next couple of months.

1o1ukpf,https://instantsalesfunnels.com/ai-sales-script-generator/,My cold email response rate jumped 40% after using an AI sales script generator for cold emails- here’s what changed!,"I run a small B2B service (web design for local businesses). Cold email is like 60% of how I get clients. But my response rate was terrible - maybe 3-4% on a good day. 

I knew my emails sucked, but I didn’t know how to fix them. They were too salesy, too long, or too boring. I tried templates from everywhere, but they all felt… fake. 

What I changed: Started using an AI tool that writes sales scripts using storytelling techniques. Not just “Hey, I noticed your website sucks, hire me” but actual narratives that connect. 

The tool is from InstantSalesFunnels - they have this free AI email generator that’s based on Gary Hal bert’s storytelling method. If you don’t know who that is, he’s basically the godfather of direct response copywriting. From the Author: I’ve been in affiliate marketing and online sales for 20 years. 

The biggest lesson I’ve learned? People don’t buy from salespeople - they buy from people they trust. Storytelling builds that trust faster than any feature list ever will. 

Here’s my new process: 

1. Use the AI tool to generate a story-based email 

2. Customize it with specific details about the prospect 

3. Keep it under 150 words 

4. One clear CTA Real example: Old email: “Hi \[Name\], I noticed your website could use some improvements. We specialize in modern web design. Can we schedule a call?” 

New email (AI-generated, then customized): “I was searching for coffee shops in \[City\] and found your site. Reminded me of when I launched my first business in 2015 - I thought a website was just a digital business card. Took me 2 years to realize it’s actually your best salesperson. 

If you’re curious about what’s possible, I put together a quick audit of your site. No charge, no pitch. Just some ideas. Want me to send it over?” Response rate went from 3% to 12%. That’s 4x more conversations from the same number of emails. 

Anyone else doing cold email? What’s working for you?

She is 46F while I am 17F. Our family is Hindu but since becoming a teen I've been less and less religious and for the past year I am openly atheist. My mom and dad don't mind at all, but this difference in beliefs has definitely caused some tension with me and my mom because I personally am very strongly against religion while she is a very devout Hindu. (Please do not debate religion in comments I just want advice) 

For the past few months she has been getting more and more into it, and it was frustrating but I just thought this must be normal for religious people and I just don't understand it. She would constantly read religious books and if I ever had a problem, she would give me spiritual or religious advice. I'm very strictly science-based so I would tell her that her advice isn't helpful to me because I don't believe in it (she knows that) and she would try and convince me that religion, god, and supernatural things are real. She completely believes these things are 100% true and that there are no other options, and that this is real science. I'm not saying that there is no possibility of it but I'm saying she refuses to look at scientific ideas and explains everything spiritually. 

For the past few weeks now she has been ONLY reading religious texts. She spent thousands on Hindu books from India, there are about 30 now the size of textbooks that she has been going through. If I ever see her on a device she is reading some sort of spiritual/religious article. She completely stopped watching TV, exercising, or doing anything else. She wakes up at 4 am everyday when she sleeps at 11-12 pm at night and she gets little to no sleep, and even after doing the math with her today and trying to explain it wasn't enough sleep and she could get sick she didn't listen to me and just ignored me, she just started saying something else. She never hosts religious meets but she hosted her first one last weekend and the people who came were extremely weird, it felt like a cult meeting, this couple didn't even call each other by name but rather religious titles of husband and wife. 

She has changed her diet a lot, cutting out onions and lemon/lime which are things in almost every Indian dish and she stopped drinking coffee completely. I just talked to my dad 30 minutes ago and he said he feels like she's getting brainwashed, and now I'm realizing that this isn't in my head. I don't know how to get through to her. 

I'm sorry if I just started rambling at the end, there is so much to say but I couldn't put it all. I keep crying typing this because I never had the best relationship with my mom but now I just feel so scared and she doesn't even feel like my mom anymore. She feels like someone else and I feel so scared.

Please do not start debating whether religion is positive or negative I just want to know how to get through to my mom and show her she's hurting herself.",1,1759977146.0,AskParents,1,1.0,False

1o1uja3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Narcolepsy/comments/1o1uja3/anyone_else_notice_significant_improvement_with/,Anyone else notice significant improvement with unisom?,"
Disclaimer: I believe there is some pretty good research that shows correlation between chronic use of some antihistamines with the development of Alzheimer's later in life. Benadryl (diphenhydramine HCl) is specifically listed  from what I've heard. Personally, I'm assuming that the unisom is in the same class and carries the same risk, though I haven't fact-checked this assumption.

(N2 without cataplexy) recently traveled outside of the US and on my way back I picked up a cold. Then suddenly had the first ""normal feeling"" days since I got diagnosed 4 months ago. I jokingly thought to myself ""dang I need to get a cold more often"". After having several really good days I started thinking back about what besides the cold had been different. The only thing that had changed was I was taking NyQuil. After the cold went away I switched to unisom and started having the good ""almost normal"" days consistently. 

This was obviously very exciting. I talked to my doctor and shared the discovery, expecting that this new information would indicate the proper nighttime medication to get my symptoms fully under control (10 being normal, with unisom I was consistently hitting ~8 everyday). 

This is what my schedule looked like after adding the unisom.

Morning:
    - modafinil (generic, 200mg)
    - creatine (momentous, 5g)
    - coffee (~150mg caffeine)

Noon:
    - modafinil (generic, 200mg)
    - creatine (momentous, 5g)
    - coffee (~150mg caffeine)

Night:
    - Unisom (doxylamine succinate 25mg)
    - Magnesium (magnesium glycinate 210mg)

I had already spoken with the jazz cares pharmacist about xywav and decided for now to explore other options. My doctor basically gave me two options: lumryz (oxybate) and trazodone (antidepressant). I found this kind of surprising since I know there are other types of sleep medication out there and from talking to her it didn't sound like either of these worked the same way that the unisom does. 

Ultimately we decided to start with the trazodone. It hasn't worked well. Immediately upon switching I dropped from having good days ~8 (able to perform) to having ""just days"" ~4-5 (able to safely stay conscious). The trazodone also made it significantly harder to actually get up in the morning and left me groggy for much longer. Very disappointing.

Having recently been fired from my job due to complications from my narcolepsy, I really need to be able to ""perform"" and not just ""stay safely conscious"". I've chosen the phrase ""safely conscious"" because the job I just lost required me to operate company vehicles and the reason they fired me was uncertainty that I could ""stay safely conscious"". Yesterday I switched back to the unisom and today has been significantly better (~7) despite accidentally staying up late last night and not sleeping as long as I usually do. 

Has anyone else has had a similar experience with unisom (or other)? Obviously unisom is not a good long-term solution chronic use is linked to Alzheimer's. If anyone has had an experience like this, specifically with unisom and then found something else (besides oxybates) that gave similar results please let me know :)

Not you.





Chapter 1





The office erupted the moment Sarah Donovan walked in. People swarmed around her like she'd just walked off a magazine cover. Even the Dylan's eyes lit up with obvious admiration.





""Well, that's Munich excellence for you.""





""Congratulations, Sarah. Yesterday's assignment—exclusive with Thaddius Huston—locked down today.""





Everyone in the States knew his rules: Thaddius Huston didn't do interviews. Huston Industries didn't need press coverage—he was the brand.





Sarah's lips curved into that perfect, confident smile.





""Just doing what I'm paid for.""





The whole newsroom was losing their minds. Since Thaddius took over his family's empire, he'd shut out every single media outlet.





I forced a smile, but inside? I was seething. Five years at Fox News. Five damn years, and I was one step away from hosting The Five.





Her introduction had been textbook perfect.





""Hey everyone, I'm Sarah Donovan.""





""Fresh off Munich, but I'll be honest, zero experience in broadcasting before.""





""Hope you'll all show me the ropes.""





Sweet. Humble. Everyone bought it completely.





A slight, almost imperceptible smirk curved her lips. Smug. Deliberate.





Dylan called us both into the office.





“Natalie,” he started, “we want an exclusive with Thaddius Huston. So here’s the challenge.”





“Whoever lands this interview takes the primetime anchor seat.”





My chest tightened in a thrill. I had this. Thaddius wasn't just some CEO to me. He was my secret husband.





As we stepped out, Sarah extended her hand.





""Good to officially meet you, Natalie.""





""Just call me Sarah.""





I raised an eyebrow. She already knew my name? Her whole arrival felt way too targeted. Like she'd come here specifically for me.





I kept my expression neutral. ""Natalie Collins. Just Natalie's fine.""





We swapped numbers and headed toward the elevators. Right before we stepped outside, she turned to me.





""Natalie.""





""Game on.""





Just an anchor gig, but her eyes were burning with pure hunger.





Like we weren't just fighting over a job.





Like this was war.





Chapter 2





Last night, Thaddius stumbled through our front door reeking of top-shelf whiskey, his cheeks flushed that telltale red. His tailored shirt clung to every muscle, jacket slung carelessly over his arm like some GQ cover shot.





The foyer lighting hit his face just right—sharp jawline, those impossibly dark eyes under thick brows that made half of Manhattan swoon.





He barely glanced up. ""What?""





No ""hey babe."" No ""how was your day."" Just \*what\*.





I didn't waste time with small talks. ""I need that interview.""





He paused, eyebrows drawing together slightly. After a moment of silence:





""Natalie.""





“I don’t do interviews. Not to anyone. No exceptions.”





When management handed down that challenge, I thought it was a done deal. Thaddius was my husband—secret or not, I thought that meant something.





Wrong.





Sitting there, completely humiliated, I went for gamble.





""Not even for your WIFE?""





He didn't even hesitate. ""Not even for my wife.""





My throat choked, but I forced the words out. “Got it.”





I tried to convince myself if I couldn’t land it, then Sarah Donovan didn’t stand a chance either.





Joke's on me.





The next morning, our news director dropped the bomb: Sarah had locked the Huston exclusive.





The room erupted. Applause, disbelief, cheers.





Meanwhile, I sat frozen, staring at my desk like I’d forgotten how to breathe.





Miranda leaned close, squeezing my arm.





“Nat, don’t you blame yourself up. This was wired from the start. She’s a plant, and everyone knows it.”





But my gut twisted, this wasn't just about losing the promotion—this was about my own husband choosing some other woman over me.





And when I found out Sarah wasn’t just anybody—she was his first love? That was the knife.





Sarah wasn't just after my anchor chair.





She was after my own HUSBAND.





After her little victory lap, Sarah played the humble card perfectly. The second Dylan left, she smiled brightly.





""Starbucks run, anyone? My treat!""





The office went wild. Landing Thaddius meant quotas smashed, bonuses doubled, job security guaranteed.





Sarah wasn’t just the new girl anymore.





She was the newsroom’s golden ticket.





""Holy shit, Sarah,"" Jake from sports gushed, ""you actually tamed the untameable. How the hell—""





Sarah's smile could've powered Times Square. “We’ve known each other a long time.""





The words were casual, but her eyes locked on mine for one brutal second. That little smirk said LONG TIME.





The room practically vibrated with gossip.





""Wait, wait,"" Amanda from lifestyle leaned in, ""are you two...?""





""Hold up,"" someone else interrupted, ""isn't he married? Like, super secretly married?""





Sarah didn’t confirm or deny. Just that coy sparkle in her eyes before she waved it off. ""Just text me your orders, guys.""





Within minutes, she was everyone's new best friend. When the dinner invites rolled in, she laughed softly and shook her head.





""Thanks, but I’ve got plans tonight. Just a welcome-back dinner.""





""Old friend's treating me to the full New York experience.""





""Old friend?"" someone echoed, suspicious, ""please tell me it's not Thaddius Huston, right?""





Sarah just blinked those innocent doe eyes, saying absolutely nothing.





That's when my phone lit up. Thaddius: ""Client dinner. Don't wait up.""





Three years of secret marriage.





Three years of him being the perfect husband—loyal, respectful, always checking in. Never so much as a whisper of scandal.





But every instinct I had was screaming the same thing:





Tonight’s ""welcome-back dinner""?





It had Thaddius written all over it.





Chapter 3





It's impossible not to be curious about your husband's first love.





Sarah was the kind of gorgeous that should come with a warning label—intimidating, untouchable, like she'd cut you down with one look. But in person? Total opposite. Warm, bubbly, the girl who'd remember your coffee order after meeting you once.





That kind of contrast? It made everyone think she was an absolute angel.





Her Instagram was a whole different story. Miss Perfect had a chatty side—posting every random thought, mirror selfies, vacation dumps, the full millennial package.





Then I saw his username in her likes, and my world tilted.





Thaddius\_Huston.





Not just casual likes either. Consistent engagement going back months. His inner circle was all over her comments too—inside jokes, references that screamed we go way back.





Six months of scrolling painted the whole picture. These people had history.





I was about to close the app when a fresh post appeared. Group dinner at some ridiculously expensive Manhattan spot, Sarah glowing in the center of what looked like New York's power elite.





Thaddius wasn't in the shot.





But there, barely visible in the corner—a familiar arm wearing a green Rolex Submariner that cost more than most people's cars.





My husband's fucking watch.



""Most incredible welcome-back dinner ever! Love my NYC family! ""



Within minutes, half our Fox News crew was in the comments.



""Sarah!! Living your best life with the 1% now!""



Her reply was sickeningly perfect: ""You're all VIPs in my book! ""



Three days. It took her three goddamn days to worm her way into half my life. She was everywhere.



For three years, I'd been the perfect wife. Left the hallway light on every single time Thaddius worked late. Tonight, I stood there staring at that switch like it held all the answers before killing it.



Screw the light. And screw him.



I was pretending to sleep when the shower started running. Then those familiar footsteps crossing our bedroom. The mattress dipped as he slid in, still radiating heat from the hot water.



His voice sliced through the darkness, smooth as always. ""No light tonight?""



I yanked the bedside lamp off so hard I nearly broke the switch.



""Forgot.""



He moved closer, smelling like that ridiculously expensive body wash and something distinctly him—the scent that used to make me melt on contact.



His arm wrapped around my waist from behind, pulling me flush against his chest like he owned me.



For one traitorous second, my body wanted to give in. Then reality slammed back.



Slowly, deliberately, I peeled each of his fingers away and shoved his hand off like it burned.



""I'm exhausted, Thaddius.""



His voice dropped to that low rumble that used to be my kryptonite. ""That's fine.""



""I'll just hold you.""



Hold me. Like I was some fragile thing that needed protecting. Like he hadn't just spent the evening with his ex-girlfriend while lying to my face about it.

When I stopped going food was going downhill all I see is posts complaining about quality / service.  (Please don’t use these to comment on foreign workers) because that’s NOT the reason I stopped going.

I found coffee was like dish water 
A toasted bagel was never toasted 
And other options just were all pretty bad.
I found no value in going and McDonald’s took over as my quick coffee option.

1o1ugjm,https://i.redd.it/8txf99gnyztf1.png,"Finally, We Got Lost","Mom, I’ll come to Italy with you after I get my diploma at the end of the month.""



""Wonderful! I’ll start preparing your visa right away."" My mother sounded delighted but paused before cautiously asking, ""But if you go to Italy, you and Vincent will have a long-distance relationship. Will he be okay with that?""



Thinking of Vincent, a surge of pain briefly flashed through my eyes before settling into quiet resolve.

""I’m planning to break up with him. I won’t ever see him again.""





Love Story1-Chapter 1





""Kaylee, mom and dad have been searching for you for 7,236 days, and we've finally found you!""





In Evergreen Cemetery, a well-dressed, elegant woman clung to my hand, crying her heart out.





""All these years you've been lost, your father and I have been searching for you around the world. Each day was a painful wait. Now that we've finally found you, and since your adoptive parents' affairs have been settled, would you be willing to come to Italy and live with us?""





Hearing the hopeful tone in my mother's voice, I glanced at the tombstone engraved with the kind smiles of my adoptive parents, my eyes red, unable to make a decision.





""I'll think about it.""





For now, I still wasn't ready to adapt to the identity of a billionaire's daughter after living as an ordinary girl for so long.





""No problem. We'll wait for your answer.""





After parting ways with my mother, I returned to my apartment at Seasides.





I opened the door to find the yellow roses in the vase on the entryway cabinet withered and a thick layer of dust coating the table.





Even the clothes on the sofa remained exactly as they were before I left.





I had been away for seven days attending a funeral, and Vincent García had been unreachable for seven days.





I took a deep breath and scrolled through our contact log on my phone.





Thirteen calls, twenty-one WhatsApp voice calls, all with the same response: ""No answer.""





Out of habit, I opened Instagram and saw Vincent's junior colleague, Alina Clark, had just posted an update:





""Watching the sea with the person I love, and he's gentler than the ocean today.""





The picture showed her and Vincent camping by the sea, watching the sunset.





Staring at the image, my swollen eyes felt like something shattered within them.





I recalled my mother asking if I wanted to settle in Italy, and I had actually considered it for Vincent's sake. But now, it just seemed laughable.





Kaylee Anderson, your love life is truly a failure!





‘Da!'





The door lock clicked.





Vincent returned in casual attire. Seeing me sitting dazed on the sofa, he quickly asked, ""Kaylee, why are your eyes so red?""





I looked at him, his clear gaze reflecting my sorrowful expression.





""I just got something in my eye,"" I replied hoarsely, then asked, ""Where have you been these past few days?""





His expression faltered slightly at my question.





""A new project came up at the lab, and I've been so busy I couldn't come home. I finally wrapped it up today.""





He watched my face, his tone concerned. ""I didn't have my phone with me in the lab, so it was only on my way back that I saw all the calls from you. Was something urgent?""





My tightly clenched fingers pressed hard into my palm as I held back my emotions.





""Nothing urgent—I accidentally dialed a few times, that's all.""





I walked over to the entryway, pulling out the wilted yellow roses and tossing them in the trash.





I had given Vincent the chance to tell the truth, but he chose to lie instead.





So, without revealing his poor excuse, I quietly went to my room to rest.





Vincent seemed unsettled, quickly following me. ""You look pale. Is it your period of this month?""





I paused.





He used to know my period date was at the end of the month, and always preparing hot milk and heating pads to soothe my cramps.





But now, it was only the middle of the month.





Watching his concerned face, I felt a coldness spreading through me.





""No, I just didn't sleep well yesterday.""





Unconcerned, Vincent took his pajamas and went to shower. ""Then get some rest early tonight.""





The sound of running water echoed from the bathroom as a dampness crept into my heart.





A notification sounded from my bedside table.





I glanced over to see a message from ""Sailor Moon"" with the flashing profile picture of a crescent moon.





""Vincent, the ocean romance has been received. Don't forget you promised to take me hiking to watch the sunrise next week!""





One glance at that message sent a dull ache through my heart.





He saved Alina's contact as ""Sailor Moon."" They watched the sunset by the ocean, and now they're planning to watch the sunrise in the mountains—how romantic!





Clenching my fists, I forced myself to remain calm.





With a quick glance at the closed bathroom door, I walked into the living room and dialed my mother's number.





""Mom, I'll come to Italy with you after I get my diploma at the end of the month.""





""Wonderful! I'll start preparing your visa right away."" My mother sounded delighted but paused before cautiously asking, ""But if you go to Italy, you and Vincent will have a long-distance relationship. Will he be okay with that?""





Thinking of Vincent, a surge of pain briefly flashed through my heart before settling into quiet resolve.





""I'm planning to break up with him. I won't ever see him again.""





Chapter 2





My mother seemed to sense the slight catch in my voice and gently comforted me.





""You've been with him for four years, yet when your adoptive parents both passed away in that car accident, he didn't even go to accompany and care for you. You're better off without a man like that. There are plenty of eligible bachelors in Italy. When the time comes, your father and I can help you find someone—you'll have your pick.""





""Alright, I'll pack up over the next couple of weeks. I'll meet you at the airport.""





Just as I ended the call, the bathroom door opened, and Vincent emerged with a towel wrapped around his waist.





""Who are you meeting at the airport?"" he asked.





I paused, looking down slightly. ""My mother.""





As he put on his pajamas, Vincent said, ""If your mom's coming to Seattle, I'll set up a dinner to welcome her.""





He assumed I meant my adoptive mother, and for a moment, I didn't feel the need to clarify everything.





I glanced at the date on my phone: June 15.





Only fifteen days left until I left for Italy.





""Talk about it later,"" I replied vaguely.





Vincent murmured a half-hearted ""hmm"" and returned his gaze to his phone, his face relaxed, occasionally breaking into a soft smile. I looked away, lying down with my eyes closed.





After some time, I heard him set down his phone and felt him slide closer, wrapping his arm around me.





My body stiffened, and I instinctively pulled his hand away.





""Babe, are you mad because I didn't answer your calls? I'll make sure to keep my phone on me from now on so I won't go off the grid again."" Vincent seemed to sense something was off, trying to coax me gently.





""No, I'm not mad. I'm just really tired.""





I kept my tone flat, unwilling to say more.





But inside, I silently told him:





Vincent, there is no ""next time"" for us.





The night was quiet, and his gentle breathing filled the room, but I couldn't sleep. Thoughts of the ""Sailor Moon"" in his phone haunted me, and I made up my mind.





I got up, picked up his phone, unlocked it, and opened WhatsApp.





Originally, I was the only pinned contact, but now it was both me and ""Sailor Moon,"" with her chat sitting at the top. Their latest messages were goodnight texts right before he slept.





My hands trembled as I scrolled through Vincent and Alina's chat history, realizing they'd been messaging daily for an entire year.





He'd spent Valentine's Day with me, yet he'd still sent her pictures of the food we shared.





He'd watched movies with me, only to text her later about whether it was worth seeing, even taking her for a second viewing the next day.





Even after our late nights together, he would share folk music with her as if he were a pure-hearted young man.





Each page of their chat clashed with my memories of our relationship, tearing me apart inside. I didn't understand it.





The man who looked at me with such genuine love—how could he share those intimate details with someone else while claiming to love me?





I stayed up all night.





The next morning, as I finished preparing breakfast, I checked the reminder on my phone.





Today marked four years with Vincent.





Six months ago, we had planned a trip to Disneyland to celebrate.





With fourteen days left until I left, I decided to end things there, bringing closure to our four years together.





At the dining table, Vincent was scrolling on his phone as he ate. I couldn't hold back. ""Couldn't that wait until after breakfast? You have a flight to catch, remember?""





He absentmindedly replied, ""Flight? Are you going somewhere today?""





For a moment, I froze, realizing he'd forgotten our Disneyland plans and the significance of today.





I had intended to part on good terms, but now I just felt foolish.





Forcing a smile, I said, ""It's nothing. I'm just seeing off a friend.""





Vincent didn't ask further.





At that moment, his phone screen lit up. I glanced over instinctively and saw a message from ""Sailor Moon"":





""I'm so hungry! Where's my breakfast?""





Vincent quickly grabbed his phone, taking two egg crepes from the table and glancing at me with a guilty look.





""My advisor needs me for something. I'm heading to the lab.""





Watching him leave in a hurry, I let out a silent laugh.





He could barely even lie convincingly. He really couldn't wait.





I picked up my phone and canceled the Disneyland tickets I had booked months ago.





On Instagram, I opened Alina's new post:





""I said I was hungry, and my boyfriend showed up downstairs with a homemade breakfast right away!""





I felt a chill wash over me.





Homemade by him?





How absurd!





I couldn't eat anymore.





I got up and threw the remaining breakfast into the trash, along with the last traces of affection I had for Vincent.





Chapter 3





I never doubted love, but love can change in an instant.





Especially after four years.





This relationship had already soured—I should have realized it sooner.





But love makes you blind.





I pulled out a large cardboard box and opened the storage cabinet that filled an entire wall.





Inside, there were remnants of our love—Kuromi plaster figurines we painted on rainy days, handmade pottery projects, bracelets, and phone cases.





The wall was covered in photos, a visible timeline of our four years together.





From our early days of warm embraces to later photos where we only posed with half-hearted peace signs.





I didn't even know when Vincent's heart had started to change.





I took a deep breath, wiping the redness from the corners of my eyes, then tossed everything from the cabinet, piece by piece, into the box.





I tore down every photo from the wall as well.





The yellowed adhesive left stark marks on the white wall, mirroring my scarred, fractured heart.





As I packed, memories surfaced, and daylight slowly faded.





Once the box was filled, I took it downstairs to the dumpster, then lay on the sofa, exhausted.





After some time, the door opened.





Vincent walked in, turning on the lights in the living room.





Seeing me curled up on the sofa, he hurried over.





""Kaylee, why are you sleeping here? You'll catch a cold!""





His concern seemed genuine, with no trace of pretense.





I stared at him for three seconds before looking away.





""I was cleaning the house and fell asleep accidentally.""





Vincent glanced around the room, noticing the changes.





""Did you throw away a lot of stuff? It feels emptier.""





I nodded lightly.





""Graduation's here; it's time to throw out the old and bring in the new.""





Graduation season is not only a time for decluttering but also for breakups.





Anything tied to the past had to go, along with the traces of a love that no longer held meaning.





""Alright, we can go shopping together later and redecorate our little nest.""





Vincent nodded, not giving it much thought.





Watching his casual demeanor, I felt a slight ache in my chest.





If he'd looked a bit more closely, he'd have noticed that everything missing was part of our couple's collection or love mementos—things I'd never discard without a reason.





But he was too busy texting to notice anything.





After all, Alina filled his thoughts now.





A notification pinged on his phone.





Vincent glanced down, and his expression shifted.





""Kaylee, today's our anniversary! Why didn't you remind me? Did you forget too?""





Only then did I realize that his phone's calendar had reminded him of today's date.





Hearing his reproach, I felt a dull weight settle inside me.





""You seemed too busy, so I didn't mention it.""





I had reminded him this morning, but someone preoccupied wouldn't have registered it.





Sensing my indifference, Vincent looked a bit uneasy.





""Babe, that was my fault. Let's make it up another day, like we used to, with all the ceremony and excitement.""





He gently held my hand, trying to appease me with a soft tone.





Just then, his phone rang again.





It was a voice call from ""Sailor Moon.""





He instinctively declined the call, but Alina dialed right back.





Seeing his guilty expression, I gave him an excuse to leave.





""Go ahead and take it; it could be urgent from the lab.""





After all, the lab had always been his go-to excuse whenever he had to step out unexpectedly.





This time, I said it myself to save him the trouble of lying again.





Vincent hesitated, then quickly went to the balcony to answer the call.





When he returned, he gave me a light hug and said softly, ""You really understand me. It was an urgent lab issue. I need to go handle it and wrap up this project.""





""When things settle down, I'll take you out for a proper anniversary celebration. We'll stay in the Disney castle, and I'll make you feel like a princess.""





I turned slightly away from his embrace, lowered my gaze, and nodded.





""Okay.""





It was a simple response, devoid of any expectation.





I had long since stopped believing in his promises.





But when I saw a red notification on Instagram, I instinctively opened it.





Alina had posted a new update—





The picture showed Vincent sipping coffee in the lab's break room.





""Sharing the same cup of coffee with my boyfriend, more intimate than a kiss.""

I don't drink alcohol, coffee, and energy drinks. I've never touched a cigarette as well as vape. Growing up, I've been using whitening soaps, but this skin condition only manifested recently. Please suggest ways on how I can get rid of it. Going to a doctor sounds like a better option, but I'm a broke student. Picture is in the comments. 🙏🏻 ",1,1759976650.0,AskDocs,2,1.0,False

I guess insomnia is just what you have to expect in my situation. What's weird is that sleep gets worse when I don't drink coffee or when I meditate seriously.  It seems as if my insomnia worsens when I take steps to slow down my nervous system. Why is that? One theory I have is that calming down the mind makes it introspective, which in turn makes it realize what kind of trouble I'm in psychologically. Being stimulated by caffeine, working as hell and going crazy makes me sleep a bit more because it makes me forget myself and the world. But by doing that I hit the wall from time to time and have to take time off work to just survive. And then, when trying to calm down my life and feel safe again, boom - I wake up after two hours every night, brain activated, same old. How do you solve this?",2,1759976631.0,insomnia,1,1.0,False

A couple of years ago I noticed join pain in my hands and left hip. After an elimination diet, I thought it might be the coffee. I stopped drinking it for almost a year and my pain went completely away after a couple of weeks. Last week, I caved and had coffee for the first time again and today my hands started hurting again. Anyone else notice this with COFFEE? Not just caffeine, like I said , I know about that but my question is in regards to coffee in particular bc I dont have this issue with any other type of caffeine. TIA.

I'd scroll through social media watching other people live these amazing lives while I sat on my couch doing the same thing every day.

Then I realized something that changed my perspective. It was that **my life wasn't boring because nothing was happening it was boring because I was avoiding everything that made me uncomfortable.**

Here's what's actually making your life feel empty:

Watching other people live instead of living yourself. YouTube vlogs, Instagram stories, TikTok trends you're consuming everyone else's experiences instead of creating your own. Your brain knows the difference between watching and doing. Vicarious living gives you none of the satisfaction of actual experiences.

Do one thing this week that makes you slightly nervous. Try a new restaurant alone. Talk to a stranger. Take a different route home. Real life happens when you participate.

You've optimized all the friction out of your life

Same coffee, same commute, same lunch spot, same weekend routine. You've eliminated all uncertainty and novelty. Your brain stops encoding memories when nothing changes. That's why time feels like it's flying by you're not creating distinct experiences to remember.

Break one routine this week. Order something different. Take a class. Go somewhere new. Novel experiences make time feel fuller and life feel richer.

You're waiting for permission to do what you want

""I'll travel when I have more money."" ""I'll start that hobby when I have more time."" ""I'll make friends when I'm in a better place."" You're postponing your life until conditions are perfect. They never will be.

You say no to everything that involves effort

Turning down invitations, avoiding plans that require driving somewhere, choosing Netflix over going out.

Comfort is the opposite of interesting. Every time you choose easy over uncertain, you're choosing boring over memorable.

Say yes to the next invitation even if it sounds exhausting. Most memorable experiences start with ""I didn't feel like going, but I'm glad I did.""

You're not learning anything new

Consuming the same type of content, talking to the same people, thinking the same thoughts on repeat.

Growth feels like aliveness. Stagnation feels like death. When you stop learning, you stop living.

Learn one new skill this month. Doesn't matter what cooking, language, instrument, coding. The act of being bad at something new makes you feel alive.

You're addicted to low-effort dopamine

Scrolling, snacking, binging shows activities that require zero effort and give instant gratification.

High-dopamine activities make everything else feel dull by comparison. Real life can't compete with algorithmically optimized content.

Cut one digital dopamine source for a week. When you lower your baseline stimulation, regular life becomes interesting again.

You have no goals worth getting excited about

By far the most important lesson is this. Going through motions without working toward anything specific. No projects, no challenges, no ""I can't wait until...""

Anticipation is what makes life feel full. When you have nothing to look forward to, every day feels the same.

You're avoiding discomfort at all costs

Choosing familiar over unknown, safe over risky, comfortable over challenging.

Stories are born from discomfort. ""Everything went according to plan"" has never been an interesting story.

Do one uncomfortable thing weekly. Have a difficult conversation. Try something you might be bad at. Ask for what you want. Discomfort is where life gets interesting.

I started saying yes to things that scared me a little. I took classes where I was the worst one. I traveled alone. I talked to strangers. I tried hobbies I might suck at.

**My life didn't become perfect.** But it became interesting.

I have stories now. I have experiences. I have things I'm working toward and excited about.

Your life gets interesting the moment you stop waiting for interesting things to happen to you. 

I hope this post motivates you to do the same as well",1,1759976596.0,Habits,0,1.0,False

When I was 8 we were adopted. Nice parents, good home. I never felt a connection with them. There was no talking about things it was always just small talk. As I grew up more and more tension in the family grew. I was an angry and sad teen and my adoptive father was a short fused military man who had picked up heavy drinking. I didn’t under that I had depression or what it was. I just hated myself. I hated everyone. I was just told these feelings go away as you get older. At some point I was kicked out and joined the army. Im a smalller guy who likes to yap and that (plus some poor decisions) got me a lot of enemies. I made a lot of mistakes but nothing that hurt anyone else. 

Every relationship I had, romantic or not, had problems. People didn’t make sense to me. Nobody did. The hatred for myself grew deeper. I couldn’t order a coffee without hating what I said or how I interacted with people. I was always the after thought in any friend group. Never the center. Never missed if I didn’t show up. 

After the army I went home. Diagnosed with severe depression. Tried to kill myself. Ran into someone who literally talked me off the edge. I went to a hospital where I sat for weeks until I realized nothing was going to happen there and said I was feeling better u til I could leave. The eggshells people stepped on around me were audible. If I thought there was any semblance of self to re acquire than that all was dismissed after just a couple conversations. 

Eventually time moved on. I started working. Things seemed up. I got promoted, bought a big house and moved my friends in during Covid. But this house was expensive. Nothing I couldn’t afford but still expensive. and… my company went under. Me and my 3 friends were left unemployed. The mortgage went unpaid. I had a girlfriend but she lived with her parents and really didn’t understand life with bills and money. She moved in to help with things after a few years but I had struggled finding consistent work and the bills were so far behind. The house foreclosed and sold for a fraction of what I owe. A good house sold for Pennie’s… and of course I owe the rest to the bank. The darkness is growing. I see no way out. I feel like I’m climbing an endless ladder that’s collapsing into the hole I’m trying to climb out of. 

I want out. I have for years. My regret for letting myself get talked out of it last time is tearing me up. I am done. I have a plan. I just do t know how to keep from ruining her life….",3,1759976522.0,SuicideWatch,1,1.0,False

every single day started with me feeling anxious, overwhelmed, and already behind before i even stood up. my brain was fried before breakfast.

the breaking point came when i realized i couldn't remember the last time i woke up feeling good. like genuinely energized and ready for the day. it had been months, maybe years. i was starting every morning by flooding my brain with other people's problems, news, drama, and comparison.

decided to try something extreme. put my phone charger in the bathroom instead of next to my bed. couldn't check it until after i brushed my teeth and washed my face. that's it. no willpower test every morning, just physically harder to grab. first day was brutal. hand automatically reached for the nightstand. nothing there. felt weird. anxious even. but i got up, did my bathroom routine, and by then the urge had passed.

managed 4 days. then a week. then it just became normal. now it's been 8 months. what actually changed: i started doing things in the morning. like actual things. made coffee slowly instead of rushing. read physical books. went for walks. had real conversations with my partner instead of both of us staring at screens. but here's the weirdest part - when i don't start my day with my phone, i barely want it during the day either. it's like that first scroll session was programming my brain to crave it all day long. break that cycle and suddenly i'm not constantly reaching for it.

my screen time went from 7-8 hours daily to around 2-3 hours. and most of that now is actually useful stuff like maps, music, or texting people i care about. not mindless consumption.

the morning sets the template. if you start reactive and distracted, you stay reactive and distracted. if you start intentional and present, the rest follows. if you're stuck in the morning scroll trap, just try moving your charger across the room for 3 days. that's it. don't try to quit your phone entirely or become some productivity robot. just make it slightly harder to grab first thing. you'll be shocked at how different your days feel.",3,1759976476.0,Procrastinationism,0,1.0,False

What if you could discover Chengdu not by rushing through landmarks, but by walking lazily through its streets—soaking in the smells, the colors, and the rhythm of local life?

This is a “lazy version” citywalk: light on your feet, yet rich in atmosphere.

📍 **Route Overview**

*(approx. 2.5 km, 2–3 hours)*

**Nijiaqiao Exit E ➡️ Yulin Market ➡️ Fanghua Street ➡️ Local Tea Shop**

Start from **Nijiaqiao Station Exit E**, and follow the flow of locals into **Yulin Market**, where Chengdu’s daily rhythm unfolds in its most authentic form. People chat over vegetables, play cards in the shade, and snack between errands — a perfect glimpse into everyday Chengdu life. Here, you can try some of the **local street favorites**: the famous **sweet-skinned duck** with its glossy caramelized skin, warm **corn pancakes** straight off the griddle, and a cup of refreshing **fermented rice drink (laozhaoshui)** that’s lightly sweet and fragrant. Every bite here feels casual, flavorful, and unmistakably Chengdu.

Continue along **Fanghua Street**, a charming lane filled with dessert cafés, vintage shops, and cozy Polaroid studios. The mix of coffee aroma, laughter, and soft afternoon light makes this part of the walk feel effortlessly pleasant.

Our final stop is a **local tea shop** that has been part of the neighborhood for over 20 years. Unlike the teahouses near People’s Park, where people go mainly to chat, here it’s all about **the art of tea itself**. The tea master will prepare several types of **top-quality teas** right before us — from **Jasmine and Oolong to Pu’er and beyond** — while sharing the stories, aromas, and traditions behind each brew. Some of these teas sell for more than **3000 RMB per 500g**, making this a rare chance to taste some of Chengdu’s finest flavors.

If you’d like, this is also a great place to pick up a **souvenir gift** for friends back home. The shop offers a wide range of teas with **flexible prices**, and the master will help you find something that suits your **personal taste and budget**. As the master always says, *there’s no absolute “better” or “worse” tea — only what fits your own preference.*

1o1ubcu,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1o1ubcu/rf_two_young_men/,[RF] Two Young Men,"Terry and Jack planned to go to a campsite. They were college students, lacrosse players in high school, academically excellent in both college and high school, and great friends both. They cared for everyone, and made sure they were always there for others. They were busy, but planned everything well. They were never sad either. They made everyone smile. They were incredible and sweet people.

They died three hours later, after leaving for the trip, and no one knows why.

Signs point to a group of people in the woods, calling themselves “The Fearful.” It was a cult that accepted Satan into their hearts, rather than God, as per information gathered from their interviews. They were always a concern. Problem is while they fit well, they had alibis. No one understands now what to do.

“Could be a bear?” I asked.

My partner just kept looking straight at the murder site. They had setup camp it seemed.

It wasn’t pretty.

“Polar bears attack people. Grizzlies and black bears run away.”

“So?”

“I don’t know,” said Lewis. I had been with him for ten years. We never promoted ourselves. We prided ourselves on the fact that we didn’t climb.

“It’s not the cult. It might be each other,” he said.

“Really?” That didn’t make sense to me. “Terry and Jack don’t seem stupid Lewis. Besides how can both of them be so ripped apart?”

“They did it at the same time?”

“What are you on about?”

“I am just entertaining ideas here. Could be a witch at this point.”

""It’s not a witch.”

“I know.”

It was afternoon. Decided to go to a local diner.

“I… Now a days it's just too common seeing such promising young men and women throw their lives away you know. I don’t wanna blame the way the world is going-“

“But you do want to-“

“I do Sam. I really do, and you know why? Because I am getting tired of hearing it in the news. It’s everywhere. And now it’s here.”

“Your favorite movie is ‘No Country for Old Men.’”

“I like it for the action, I don’t care about the themes.”

“Well the theme is things have always been bad, and they always find ways to be uniquely bad, and as we grow older, we can’t keep up.”

“Okay then, but does that address these two boys?”

I kept quiet for a bit. Lewis spoke again.

“Exactly. These young men had everything going forwards in their lives. Eventually we will figure out what we always do. Drug addicts on meth and psychedelics or some other crap robbed and killed them thinking that they are demons or something. Except I don’t ever know if they are making that last crap up for a psych eval. Better to bring religion than to admit they are monsters and finally dumb enough to act and also dumb enough to talk.”

Lewis starred at his coffee.

“What do you want bud?”

“I just wanna stop it before it happens instead of catch up. And I want it from all sides. I am not naive Sam, I am not. But society isn’t a tornado. It’s us. It is our little mistakes always adding up greater than their sum faster than we thought, because life is just slow enough to make us think where we are is where we will stay now.”

Lewis closed his eyes.

“And I know that works for hope too.”

1o1u730,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o1u730/fitness_revolution_investment_thesis/,Fitness Revolution Investment Thesis,"Hey everyone! Just wanted to share my thoughts on a potential investment opportunity that I've been contemplating.

Basically, I'm of the belief that a health revolution is gripping the young population of America and other developing nations since people are becoming far more conscious than generations past of what they put into their bodies as well as what physical exercise they're doing. I think this is driven by a few different factors (in no particular order):

1. Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Our fundamental needs, at least in richer countries, are met for the most part. However, there is a crisis of purpose for many. Fitness can help fill that void.
2. The proliferation of Social Media. We've become inundated with photos and videos of what ""perfect"" bodies should look like. This has fostered a desire in people to try and achieve that for themselves.
3. GLP-1 drugs. Adoption of these drugs will rise rapidly in the years to come. With it will come a desire to ramp up exercise, in order to justify both the results that people are getting from these drugs and their high cost.
4. Protein centric marketing. Starbucks just added protein infused coffee to their menu. ""Protein"" really is the marketing buzzword of the day.

Although I primarily have publicly traded stocks in mind, does anyone have a few tickers (ETFs are great as well) that I can invest in which are best poised to capitalize on this revolution? Also open to hearing about private or alternative investment opportunities as well.

I was having a crap day today because last night I tested positive to the dreaded Covid virus. Wah!

But when middle son came home, he was carrying a familiar box…a mysterious box, if you will!

I immediately began to get excited to open it.

THIS time, I opened the box with NO kid witnesses, so I had FIRST pick of the goodies.

However, I did not have first grabs on them as each and every item had to go through a specialized cat scan, as you will see in the photos.

Ziggy is shown scanning the box, and Twilight and Rollo (all rescues,) were scanning individual items.

I was so thrilled at all of my mysterious items contained in the box!

Glowing glass!

u/RadioGuySD2 knows about my new collection of uranium glass (and I mean, NEW! It contained one piece before today, and this came from RD!) He included some gorgeous pieces. You can see in the photos the plate/serving tray, the small pitcher & creamer, and the shot glass. Also glowing is the Fenton custard satin glass vase! I didn’t even realize it glowed until I shone the flashlight on it!!! Exciting!

Bags, bags, bags!!!

RD sees my endless comments on bags in his posts, so he knows I have a “thing” for them. I was yelling “YES!” when I saw the red leather Kate Spade purse! Also I now also own a Coach and Guess purse! Squeeee!

T-shirts 

It was fun to see curated shirts just for me! Of course, the Texas shirt screams u/ellieD! I laughed so hard when I saw the “Ew people!” Cat shirt! I also love the Native American star dancer parody of the Starbucks shirt!

Kids treats!

RG was kind enough to include gifties for my little ones. So sweet! I took those downstairs after I retrieved my things first.

I put them on the coffee table, and it was like a shark chum. I had to back away to ensure to keep all appendages intact!

I have to say, squeezing that chicken sounds like a dying cow in a hailstorm!!!

Other sundries

The ceramic shoe had me in a barrel so I had to look it up! It is actually a girlie (my favorite!) wine bottle holder! Perfect gift for me! (Photo from the internet included.)

It feels better than my birthday!

by Preston Dennett

All UFO encounters are interesting, but perhaps the most fascinating is when UFOs land and humanoids come out! Here are ten cases of UFO landings from across the world including the United States, Brazil, Australia, Italy, Spain, Norway, Finland, Scotland, France and England. They span over a period of five decades. They involve a wide variety of humanoid figures. Many are multiple witness cases. Almost all of them involve some form hard evidence such as landing traces, animal reactions, electromagnetic disturbances, psychic effects and physiological reactions. Some include government involvement and even disturbing threats from apparent men in black.

JUL 23, 1947, PITANGA BRAZIL: Topographer Jose C. Higgins hears a high-pitched hum. Suddenly a metallic craft lands next to him and out come three beautiful ETs wearing weird spacesuits. Jose founds himself surrounded by them. To his relief, they appear to be friendly. Feeling fear, he retreats and watches them from a distance as they begin playing like small children.

AUG 1960, NEWCASTLE, NSW AUSTRALIA: Helen Aldridge is awakened by a buzzing noise coming from outside her home. Looking out the window, she sees a craft shaped like a toy top landing in her backyard. Out steps a humanoid dressed in an olive-green jumpsuit. To her shock, it climbs over her fence and approaches right up to her window.

JUL 31, 1966, PRESQUE ISLE STATE PARK, PA: When their car gets stuck in the sand, Gerald LaBelle goes for help, leaving behind Betty Klem, Doug Tibbets, Anita Haifley and her two children. Without warning, a UFO lands in the forest next to them. Police arrive and leave with Doug to investigate. At this point, a huge hairy humanoid emerges from the forest and attacks the car. Before long officers from Project Blue Book arrive to investigate.

AUG 29, 1967, CUSSAC, FRANCE: When 13-year-old Francois Delpeuch and his little sister Ann-Marie (age 9) go to retrieve the family cows, they come upon a huge glowing sphere and four small humanoids walking around beneath it. When they approach for a closer look, the strange beings notice the two children and begin floating one by one back into the craft.

FEB 5, 1971, KINNULA, FINLAND: Two forestry workers (Peter Aliranta and Esko Sneck) get the shock of their lives when a UFO lands next to them in the forest. A small 4-foot-tall being emerges and approaches Peter. When the being turns around to enter the craft, Peter rushes forward and grabs the ET by the foot. It’s a decision that he will regret for a long time.

NOV 14, 1976, WINCHESTER, ENGLAND: Joyce Bowles is driving home. Her friend Edwin Pratt is in the passenger seat. They are concerned to see a UFO dropping down from the sky ahead of them on the road. Suddenly their car steers itself off the road. When they finally get it to stop, they see a UFO blocking the roadway and humanoids looking out the windows at them. Then one emerges from the craft, walks right up to them and stares at them fixedly. Their strange adventure has only begun.

MAY 18, 1977, ELGIN, SCOTLAND: Karen McLennan and Fiona Morrison (both 10-years-old) are playing near their homes when they hear a soft humming noise in the woods. They go to investigate and come upon a landed craft. Standing next to it is a tall slender man dressed in a silvery jumpsuit. As the man walks towards them, the girls flee. When they turn around, they see the craft flying off. But when they get home, they learn there are more witnesses. And then the threats start coming in.

SEP 18, 1978, SAN GIORGIO DI NOGARO, ITALY: Railway employee Giorgio Filiputti only wants to enjoy a quiet day of fishing. But it’s not to be. He hears a strange noise and an odd breeze. Going to investigate, he comes upon a landed craft. A weird 4-foot-tall humanoid looks surprised to see Giorgio approach. He stares at Giorgio and begins to work on apparently repairing his craft.

NOV 24, 1978, GERENA, SPAIN: When four young men go hunting along the Guadiamar River, they get a lot more than they bargained for. Seeing strange lights in the forest, they come upon a landed UFO and a 7-foot-tall humanoid. The strange figure starts walking towards them. When it gets too close, the men run away in a panic. Later, strange land-traces are found.

JUL 25, 1981. STJORDAL, NORWAY: Hjordis Hokstad wants only to enjoy her morning coffee and watch the wild deer in the field behind her house. Instead she sees a landed UFO and a weird humanoid wearing a spacesuit walking around the craft. She grabs her binoculars and gets a nice close look. Little does she know, her neighbor is watching the whole thing from his house.

There is no more room for denial. The evidence for the reality of UFOs and extraterrestrials is here for those with the courage to examine it. We are not alone! We are only one of many different humanoids in a universe teeming with intelligent life.

Please hug your pets a little tighter tonight, always sleep with your doors closed and remember to unplug your appliances, even if they are less than a year old.

On Friday October 3rd while my husband and I were working, our coffee pot malfunctioned and started a house fire.
Now to layout my house we lived in a barn, we converted it 6 + years ago, my mother who passed away 2 years ago spent so much time and energy building us our home. We had two bedrooms downstairs, one for my two boys, one for my husband and I, as well as an open loft my eldest slept in. The fire started in the kitchen, downstairs across from my daughter’s bedroom. I left for work at 8:40 and the call for the fire was received at 12:16. The fire went from the counter to the soffit ripping into my daughter’s room. This fire destroyed our home, most of our belongings and all of my daughters things. We are truly lucky it did not happen while we were sleeping because we would have never been able to have gotten my daughter out in time.

While we were lucky this story is about the family members I did loose. My loves, my babies with fur that drove me crazy, but a crazy I’d give anything to get back…

Maxie, Maxie Moodle doodle, Moodles, you were always waiting with welcoming mews on the stairs when I got home. You’ve been a constant for almost 15 years. The snuggliest of cats, Sadye’s biggest love. My bed warmer and the best cuddle buddy. Sleeping will never be the same without you.

Hubert, Hubie, Hubie doobie dog, Poobert, Poobie, my heart in dog form. The scraggly little rodent I picked up from a creepy man on my way home from a wedding. This little shit bit me the second I got him out the car, hid under my bed for what felt like 2 years straight and ate all of my good bras in the first year of his life. You didn’t listen, chased delivery trucks and bit my ankle on the daily when I was feeing you. The king of the cheese tax and the best at collecting any snacks really. A love I’ve never had for a dog, you were one of the best parts of my days. What will I do with all the underwear I’ll have now that you are gone.

Tucker, Tuck Tuck, Tucker F*cker, the puppy for Sadye because Hubert only liked me. You vomited the most fowl substance on Josh on our way home. You were the best dog, loved the kids something fierce. Demanded pets and snuggles every second of everyday. I took those snuggles for granted. Even through you recently took up eating everything that wasn’t attached to the floor, I still loved you. You were the best camping buddy, keeping my feet warm and always ensuring I couldn’t move too much in bed. I wouldn’t have wanted it any other way.

Cheddar, Cheddar Biscuit, Cheddar Nana Candy Cane Bad Biscuit. The foster puppy who never left. With your under bite and unaligned jaw, scaler of all fences. The best companion for my human babies and my walking buddy. You loved camping or really being anywhere with us, and we loved having you. You were always the easiest going pup. You could often be found curled up in a ball under one of the kids heads. The couch will never be the same without you.

Pickles, Pickle Wickle, Fluffy Butt, my weirdo. Your favorite place to sleep was curled up next to the litter box. Chin scratches were your favorite. Only snuggling when the time was right, which was typically when the boys were going to sleep. You loved the kids. Attacker of my toes if I dared to move them while you were on the bed. I’ll miss seeing your face hanging over the stairs when I get home.

Tacos, Taco Baby, Mr. Tacos Megatron Destroyer of all Wolds, the cat that was not supposed to be ours. You came into our lives by surprise and we couldn’t have been luckier. This ferocious beast at the vet was the kids ragdoll. He gave zero fucks about the dogs or anything else around him. He was going to lay in the middle of the floor regardless of what was going on. The kids could be found with him tuck him under their arms often, snuggling him under a blanket or harboring him in their room like a fugitive. He loved every second of it and so did we.

Every time I walk across a room and don’t trip, use the bathroom by myself, every time I pick up food off the floor or I have to use a blanket to replace your warmth, I’ll think of you. We will never be able to replace you. You were all so loved and will forever be missed. We were so lucky to have you. I’m so sorry I couldn’t save you.

I found her very attractive, and during the visit she kept steering the conversation toward us being alone together.

We eventually ended up alone, and it felt like there was clear mutual interest, but I completely froze. This happens to me a lot: as soon as I sense that something could actually happen, I start overthinking, worry about saying or doing the wrong thing, and end up going quiet until the energy disappears.

After that, I had to see her once or twice more that day, which felt a little awkward. Earlier we’d joked about trying every coffee machine on campus, so before leaving I asked if she wanted to “get coffee” tomorrow. She said she was busy.

Now it feels like whatever spark there was is gone.

**Did I completely ruin it, or is there still a way to handle this gracefully? More broadly, how do I stop freezing up when I feel attraction?**

I’d appreciate any advice on confidence, timing, or how to follow up without making things weird at work.

**TL;DR:** I (M, 30s) work tech support on a college campus and had clear mutual attraction with a coworker, but I froze when we were alone. Things felt awkward afterward, and she turned down my casual coffee invite. Did I ruin the connection, and how can I stop freezing up when someone’s into me?

**Edit:**  
A few comments suggest that maybe I misread the situation. I totally understand why it could look that way from the outside, but I just want to clarify that the sexual tension was definitely mutual. The energy between us was very strong, and it wasn’t just wishful thinking on my part.

Lately, I’ve been torn between romantic nostalgia and modern reality. Dating apps like Hinge, Tinder, Bumble.. and even low-key spaces like Doublelist.. are just part of the landscape now. You can scroll through a dozen faces before your coffee’s cold. But does all that choice actually lead to connection?

Some of my friends swear by apps. One even met her long-term partner on Feeld. But for every “we matched and fell in love” story, there’s a handful of ghostings, burnout, or just... meh energy. The speed of online dating can make things feel more disposable, like everyone’s kinda hedging their bets.

On the flip side, the old-fashioned way.. meeting through friends, work, or just a random moment.. feels rarer now. But there’s something more grounded about it. Less performance. More intention.

Curious where y’all stand on this. Do dating apps still feel worth the emotional energy? Or has the algorithm kind of robbed the romance out of modern love? And for those who’ve tried both.. did one feel more real than the other?

I ordered from him a couple times but was too nervous to spark a conversation, so around the end of August when I had to head back to college (I live not too far from my school) I left a note attached to a tip titled ""to the barista with XYZ characteristic"" and in it I wrote that I liked his style and thought he was cute, and asked if he would want to get coffee sometime, along with my number. 

However, I signed off with my coffee order, not my name or any other defining characteristic. I wasn't necessarily expecting a response (as I 100% acknowledge that I'm not even owed one), however, I guess I thought that if he wasn't interested (for any reason!!) that he would text me say that. 

I guess I'm left wondering if he even saw the note/knows who left it; the reason that I can't stop thinking about it is because I really do like the cafe, but now I feel a little weird going on days that I know he works because what if he *does* know it was I who left it, and I seem creepy for continuing to go there 😭. What sparked this concern was I was back home for a weekend recently, and this was on a day I thought that he didn't work, but he ended up coming in for his shift as I was standing in line, which made me feel weird. 

Idk I think I'm definitely being dramatic and overthinking stuff (especially with the gender roles involved of me being female and asking out a guy) but I wish that I had gone a different way about approaching him/am wondering if that bridge is officially burned there.

There is not much on picky eaters in this sub. Please accept this post. Thanks!


My wife who I married last year is a very picky eater compared to me who like cooking and eating all sorts of food. Out of 10 things, If I eat 9, she would only eat 2-3. 

To make it simple if I were to go on a random date and bring her something to eat, there is high chance she wont eat it. 

The real problem is I asked this before marriage is she has eating preferences to which she responded no and her parents said she eats everything. 

The other issue is I dont want to have kids that are very picky about what they eat or how they eat (wife doesnt each egg unless is fried). 

She barely even eats tbh and It was not until a big fight that she started eating small dinners with me after I complained we barely ate food together in the past few months. Her bf is coffee/tea, lunch is a small portion of sandwich and dinner which she didnt use to eat, now eats one small portion of sandwich. 

Which we dont normally fight and I dont want to force her to do things, my say is Ihv already asked things before coz Ik this may become an issue in the future and I am exactly there where I thought I dont want to be. ",1,1759974248.0,MuslimMarriage,0,1.0,False

I’m 34 and live just outside Toronto. My faith has become the quiet strength that grounds me ; it guides how I love, what I value, and the kind of life I hope to build. I’m Catholic at heart, not rigid in practice, but my relationship with God continues to grow deeper as I do.

I believe love and marriage are sacred callings ; a shared mission rooted in loyalty, laughter, and grace.

✨ **A bit about me:**

* I’ve created a life I’m genuinely happy in: a fulfilling career, my own home, and a circle of family and friends who bring me joy.
* I’m feminine and nurturing by nature, yet strong, curious, and independent in spirit.
* Fitness is a regular part of my routine I love feeling healthy and capable (still working on those abs)
* My favorite memories usually involve good food, laughter, my dog, and the people I love — whether that’s a cozy dinner or a spontaneous day trip.
* I love the simple things that make life rich: morning coffee, hosting loved ones, being by the water, and making my home feel alive and warm.

✨ **Faith & values:**

* I believe intimacy is sacred and meant to grow out of love, trust, and commitment.
* My faith has evolved with me ; I grew up Catholic but only as I’ve gotten older have I truly felt connected to my roots.
* My love for Jesus runs deep, and I’d love a partner who shares a similar foundation ideally Catholic or Christian.
* I dream of going to church together, celebrating Christmas and Easter surrounded by both our families, and raising children who know love, joy, and faith.
* Kindness, humility, and emotional maturity are non-negotiables for me.

✨ **What I’m hoping to find:**

* A grounded, faith-driven man who leads with purpose and heart.
* Someone strong and steady ; physically, emotionally, and spiritually.
* A partner who values family, health, and balance; who can be both playful and serious, affectionate and dependable.
* I admire ambition not for status, but for the desire to build a meaningful, abundant life together.

✨ **The vision:**

We pray together, build something lasting side by side, and raise a family that feels like home. Our days are full with laughter, faith, love, children and maybe a few dogs running around.

In short: I’m looking for a man who’s loyal, grounded, God-centered, and ready to build a life rooted in love, family, and faith. If that resonates, I’d love to hear from you ❤️

Hopefully it's good. Please give feedback on what i could change or make better. Thanks!)

I rub my face with the palms of my hands, then scrape the crust from my sunken eyes. unable to sleep, I begin slithering out of bed, pressing my feet against the cold tile putting some life back into my tired body. I Make my way to the bathroom for a late night piss, taking every step as softly and delicate as I can. As if stepping too hard would send me straight into the downstairs neighbors living room, or disturb some sleeping beast hidden within the murky shadows of the tiny apartment.
     As I walk by my mothers room I can hear her whining and whimpering like a sick dog. Things haven't been the same lately. A few weeks ago, my father lost his life due to a tragic murder, he wasn't a great man by any means. But he was my father none the less. My mom took it a lot worse than I, she stopped eating, she stopped cleaning herself, and it was up to me to make things work. I, however, didn't have any plans to make things any easier. A complete and total loser. 
     I had, and have, no aspirations to get a job, or apply myself to any meaningful cause. It wasn't my fault we are here in this shitty apartment. It isn't my fault my moms retirement money is running out. It isn't my fault that I exist here to experience it all. 
     I pressed my ear to the door, her whines becoming clearer than before. She was praying, it sounded so desperate. As if begging for her life, as if some being was going to come from the sky and say ""Here you go! You're wonderful husband!"" and put him right next to her. I smack my lips together and continue my assault towards the toilet, ""my bladder is about to fucking explode"" i scoffed, as if that was my biggest problem.
     Sitting down, I retrieve my phone and it begins to glow under the dim LED lights. They flickered and threatened to shut off at any moment. Scrolling through my mostly empty phone, hold for one notification from my only remaining friend, jackson.

Jackson: ""You doing alright?""

Of course I'm not doing fucking alright. I thought before mindlessly pressing letters on the keyboard

""Yeah."" 

I replied, sending it swiftly before watching three dots appear inside a bubble.

""Why are you awake?"" 

i added, seeing the dots disappear for a moment before reappearing shortly after.

Jackson: ""I could ask you the same thing.""

If I rolled my eyes any harder the bathroom would have spun upside down and I'd be covered in toilet water and piss

""Just can't sleep.""

Jackson: ""I can guess why, I can't blame you.""

No shit. 

Jackson: ""If you ever need anything i'm here, i know you've been all distant and stuff. I can see why. Just let me know.""

""Sure"" I added callously, turning my phone off and standing up. I didn't wash my hands, it didn't matter anyway.

Creeping my way back towards my man made cell, i hear a faint clicking noise coming from the hall

Click.

I make my way to the noise.

Click.

It's coming from my mothers room.

Click.

I press my ear to the door once more.

BANG!

I nearly shit myself after hearing the thunderous noise from the other side of the door, I pull away, holding my ear tightly as i regain my wit. The wet plop of something falling over and what sounded like a spewing faucet dripping onto the floor

""FUCK!"" I screamed, making an attempt to open the door but quickly realizing it was locked. I take a few steps back and slam my body into it. Nothing, I take another step back and try again. Nothing, I give it one final attempt, before flying through the door and landing in something sticky and wet. My faded shirt now heavy and soaked with the smell of copper and gunpowder. 

     Standing up quickly i rush to the light switch and flick it furiously, the dim LED light coming to life revealing the scene as if it was a stage and my mothers lifeless corpse was the show. ""What...the fuck.."" I manage to squeeze out of my throat as I witness the mess before me. My heart pounding like a wild animal trying to desperately escape my chest. My hand covers my mouth but the torrent of bile escapes anyway. 

     Through blurry red vision, I see what event had unfolded. Her body lie in bed, against the white sheets now stained and a window left open. ""fuck fuck FUCK!"" I screamed, running over to the nightmare. ""Momma!"" I hold her hand tightly, now it's my turn to pray. I begged and pleaded, and shook and shook. Nothing but the cold wind from the open window replied. 

     As I let my eyes wander the room that seems to be turned inside out, missing jewlery box, a ring that used to be on her hand now gone, a red imprint of where it was too tight on the finger. At that moment I lost it all, suddenly and without warning. As the tears begin to stop, and the silence fills the room again. Nobody called the police, I couldn't afford a funeral, or an ambulance. So i left her there and made my way back to my room, lying in bed and praying it was all a bad dream.
    

 The sunlight coming through the curtains burned through my eyelids, sitting up in a daze before feeling the sticky blood between my fingers. I was numb. I looked down at my soaked shirt. before standing up and retracing my bloody footprints back to my mothers room. I peered inside the broken door and stared at her gray body. 30 minutes later i finally stepped inside, sitting down next to her as if i was waiting for her to tell me goodmorning. ""Hi momma."" i whispered, placing my hand on her shoulder. No response, not even a blink from her glazed over eyes.
     
I stood up before making my way to the kitchen, fetching cleaning supplies and a screwdriver. Making my way back to the room and i began to clean. I scrubbed, and scrubbed, and scrubbed. Till the smell of bleach was too strong and the blood had been turned into a light pink. Using the screwdriver to pick out fragments of bone from the headboard that were too deep for my fingers to dig out. the rest was a blur, but she was still alive to me
     A few weeks passed, and everyday i turned the bottle upside down and watched the chunk of meat float to the top, to do it again. I felt satisfied with my handiwork. Jackson called about a hundred times before i finally decided to pick up. 

Jackson: ""Hey, Riley.""

A long pause replied.

Jackson: ""hello?""

""Hello."" I answered back, my focus on the bottle i held up to the sun. 

Jackson: ""How...are things.."" He searched for his words

""Fine."" I replied emotionless. Now sitting down on the couch.

Jackson: ""How's your mom doing?"" he spoke with concern, like a doctor about to deliver bad news.

""She's great."" I let out a soft chuckle. ""Why are you calling me."" I returned to my callous tone.

Jackson: ""I wanted to check on you, is it okay if i come over some time. Maybe have some beer and talk about life."" 

I smiled at his words.

""Sure. Actually, i have something to show you.""
I could almost hear his grin through the phone.

Jackson: ""Did you find yourself a man or something?"" he laughed out, i didn't.

""Something better!"" I gleefully spoke

Jackson: ""That's great Ry, i'll see you soon.""

I hung up the phone, placing it down and putting the bottle on the coffee table. A few hours passed before Jackson arrived at the dingy apartment. I opened the door for him and his faced scrunched up. 

""How much did you clean? It smells like a public pool in here."" He stepped inside, closing the door behind him. 
     ""I cleaned for you."" I spoke out shortly, motioning to the couch for him to sit. 

""What's that?"" he pointed to the yellow pill bottle now a slight crimson. 
     ""My mom."" I said casually before sitting down next to him.
      He nearly choked on his spit.
""Your mom? What do you mean?"" He seemed a little upset. ""Are you losing your mind?"" He joked, trying to lighten the mood. 
     but i wasn't laughing. The silence reclaimed the room before i decided to speak. 
     ""Someone broke in and shot her."" I said dryly. ""Part of her liver."" I pointed to the bottle. 
     Jackson shot up and backed away from me like i was a rabid animal
     ""You can't just fucking do that!"" He managed to shout out.
     ""Well i did."" I said satisfied.
     ""You're sick."" His voice faltered, his back now against the wall. ""You can't just put a piece of meat in a bottle like its a fucking chia pet Ry!"" He pleaded. I remained silent before opening the bottle and removing the chunk of meat.
   
  ""Believe it or not, Jackie, she's been doing very well."" I placed it on the table and it began to squirm a little. ""She even eats."" I giggled out, rolling the sleeve of my sweater up to reveal a cluster of quarter sized holes covering my left arm. 
     ""What the fuck is wrong with you Ry!"" He began to shout louder. ""I'm calling the police, this isn't right!"" He reached for his phone and i snatched it from his hands.
     ""Don't be so rude, Jackie. I wouldn't call the cops on you for having a sick mother.""
     ""Shes not sick Ry she's fucking dead!"" He spat ""And that's not your mother that's a piece of meat it doesn't mean anything! it's no different from the beef in your fridge!"" He gagged, probably thinking about what else i kept in there.
    
 ""She needs to eat. Jackie, just like you, and me. and i won't let you disrespect her like that."" I growled out, now pinning him against the wall. The clump of meat on the table began to writhe. 
     His eyes wandered to it and his breathing became heavy. ""Did that thing just fucking move?!"" He gasped out, my forearm pressing against his throat harshly. Jackie finally gathered the courage to push me off of him. I hit the floor before standing back up. 
    
 ""Ry you need to get rid of that thing it's not healthy."" He demanded. 
    ""Would you do that to your mom?"" i pouted, crossing my arms like a disruptive teen.
     His face scrunched again and he seems to notice it wriggle more. Jackie reached for a bible and made an attempt to crush it beneath the holy spirit. I jumped in the way and hit him across the face with a fist full of rage, he hit the ground and i straddled him. Bringing my fists down again and again until he stopped moving. I panted heavily and stood up, dusting myself off and wiping the sweat from my forehead. 
    
""Geez...Guess i gotta clean this up."" I began to go for my cleaning supplies before making a realization. I don't have to feed mother anymore.
     I placed mother inside of Jackies mouth, it wormed its way down his throat like a tape worm in a bear. 
     ""Well i'll leave you two to it then."" i giggled out, leaving mother to eat to her hearts content. Before returning to my bedroom for an afternoon nap.
     I awoke way past the setting sun, arriving in the living room where Jackies half consumed body was beginning to rot. Beside him was a bowling ball sized blob of flesh that bubbled and writhed. I smiled and crouched down next to it, one eye peering up at me. ""Not hungry anymore are you?"" 
    
 For the few hours i was away, momma had grown a pleasureful amount. I was very excited to see that. I picked her up and cradled her in my arms and began to pet the few strands of hair she had began to grow. ""You're so beautiful, momma."" I whispered
     Jackie began to stink, his body began to sink. mom could only eat so much of him before he began to rot. This was a problem

Knock knock, the door rumbled angrily as i placed mother down and approached the door. Looking through the peephole i noticed it was my neighbor.
     ""Riley."" The voice said from the other side.
I unlocked the door and opened it barely enough for my bloodshot eye to peek through, my stringey greasy hair sticking to my forehead like the grudge. 
    ""What do you want."" I demanded an answer.
His face contorted as the smell hit his sinus.
     ""I don't know what the hell you're making in there but it stinks like shit."" He pinched his nose ""Cut it out or i'm calling the landlord."" 
     ""okay..."" i whispered out, staring at him blankely until he was uncomfortable enough to turn around and leave. I shut the door, realizing that leaving the window open was probably not a good idea. I shut it tightly, and turned down the air conditioner in a futile attempt to stop the smell from leaking out of the apartment. 
     
Mother finished up with Jackie, leaving me as the only other food source. The stench and chemicals of a rotting body has made me sick, i'm so tired, and i forget things more often. ""Why did this happen?"" i asked, laying the bloody ball of meat in the bed beside me.
     Mother didn't respond, but i nodded anyway. ""You're right."" i whimpered out, closing my eyes and covering myself with a blanket i stopped changing months ago. My body covered in blisters and dripping scabs, there was no point in changing them anymore. 
     Mom began to grow more teeth, i could feel them latching onto my thighs, and arms every night, and every day. The nerves inside me damged beyond repair. ""Goodnight. Mama."" i wheezed out as i push my final breath out. ""I left the door open for you."" I reminded her. ""Go eat."".",4,1759973862.0,creepcast,3,1.0,False

1o1tege,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1o1tege/aio_for_wanting_to_raise_my_concerns_to_the/,AIO for wanting to raise my concerns to the president of the company over the office setup?,"Five months ago, I applied to a small company with around 15 employees. I initially thought it was for a WFH position as my friend who used to work here said, but apparently new hires are now required to report to the office. Which was okay with me. My previous job was an office job and I loved it.

It was the president who interviewed me. He seems like a nice and understanding guy. He works in the main office abroad. He said the current office has 4 desks in a shared office space with other companies. He said this is temporary as they are looking for a bigger one to accommodate everyone slowly getting back to the office. He said there is free coffee in the pantry. When I asked if they have training programs, as I don't have experience in x software, he said not to worry cause there will be. He also said there was one new person hired around this time. This all led me to believe that there are more people in the office, especially considering this was in May.

So I started working here in August and well, it's not what I was expecting. It's a 2.5mx3m room with just enough space for 3 desks. Me and the other new hire's desks are face to face and we are literally at opposite corners. It's very claustrophobic. My first few days was just me cause the other new hire was on leave that time. Apparently, no one else reports to the office besides the 2 of us. The manager just dropped off my computer and left. There are no windows. It's so cold from the centralized AC. We're currently 3 in the office, and it's been slightly better. I thought the incentive of working in an office is collaboration and resources, which I don't feel. I thought I'd at least have a senior here to guide me, but nope, just a bunch of new hires. It feels isolating and claustrophobic.

There were other red flags, like a lead sending me a link to cracked software (not our main software) when I asked for access, even though I was told that they don't use cracked software. And the promised training was just a Teams call from another lead giving me a list of what to research about said software plus an exercise.

The manager came by to drop something off my first month and told us that if we feel cramp, we can walk around outside to the pantry cause we have access there, but no access to the coffee and water. I'd been getting water for weeks. She said it should be okay cause no one reprimanded us anyway. She said access to coffee and water is an additional charge on their rent.

I don't think the President knows what's going on here. He asked me on Teams if the space is big. He also asked how the coffee was. I explained what the manager said and he was confused. He said he was told by her that we do have access. So he apologized and we were given access.

I have a lot of concerns and feel in a way, catfished. I could raise my concerns to the manager or lead, but they're very aware of it anyway. I don't see any concrete plans of getting other employees back to the office or searching for a bigger place.

AIO for feeling catfished here? I want to raise my concerns to the president, or propose a temporary WFH setup while they ""look for a bigger place"".

My symptoms are burning urethra, clitoris pain, frequent urination, some lower belly and back pain. I have found that cutting back on coffee helps, but pain is still there. When I’m dehydrated that’s when the pain is the worst.

Last night I had TERRIBLE uti symptoms, so bad I couldn’t sleep. I did have my wisdom teeth taken out a week ago and was prescribed amoxicillin. Urgent care prescribed me Cefalexin. I’m worried about my body reacting badly to many antibiotics so soon.

I leave the room and he follows me... and don't get me wrong he's always been a Velcro dog but never had to be touching me 24/7. He's my everything but lately it's just been so extra.

This is a quote from the Japanese/Taiwanese film 18x2 Beyond Youthful Days. For me, nothing describes the joys of solo traveling more perfectly than these words.

Reflecting on this, I realize that every country I’ve visited has left a lasting impression. I remember my first solo trip to Colombia, where I stayed in a hostel attached to a family house. The hosts were very welcoming, often inviting me to dinner, introducing me to their friends, and suggesting activities or sights to visit. For the first time in a long while, I felt like I was part of something big.

Recently, I went on a tour around Europe. Most countries I visited were like places of rest. No one was rushing; they were taking their time, indulging themselves in a walk along the river, reading in the park, or sipping their coffee at the bakery. As someone who travels solo, I’ve often felt insecure whenever I see people traveling with their family or friends. But in Europe, everyone was comfortable doing their own thing, and that just bled onto me.

I’m back in the U.S. now, but upon watching the film, I’m inspired to plan my next trip.",3,1759973252.0,backpacking,0,1.0,False
1o1t82m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1o1t82m/cooking_for_200/,Cooking for 200,"Looking for some advice/suggestions. I am coordinating a weekend long event at our local sports club. As a part of the event, we provide meals: 2 breakfasts, 1 lunch, 2 dinners, all buffet style. Typically, breakfast is very simple, since not a lot of people show up for it (usually just fruit, baked goodies, granola bars, coffee, etc). Lunch will probably be deli trays for sandwiches. We usually cater both dinners. This year, I am looking into saving money on one dinner in order to spend a little more on the second dinner. One way to do this would be to cook it instead of cater it. 

So I'm looking advice on how to pull this off. I would need to feed nearly 200 people. I would need to provide a vegetarian option. There is no real kitchen on site, but plenty of refrigeration and one oven/stove to reheat things. Lots of chafing dishes available for setting up buffet. Ideally, I would like to make everything at least one day in advance. I am a very capable home cook, but haven't cooked in this quantity before. I would have help to pull this off (my mom would help and was a lunch lady, so has experience with food safety and cooking large volumes). 

My thoughts: I think a basic chili with cornbread might work. I could do a beef based one and a bean based vegetarian one. This seems like something I could make in advance and it would keep well (I could even make it a week ahead and freeze it). 

I am looking for input on how possible this is to pull off? Has anyone cooked for something like this before? Suggestions? Any better ideas than chili?

Okay, I know it’s just Monopoly, but seriously… is anyone else dealing with this crap? I’ve been to McDonald’s *six times* since Monopoly started — six *different* locations — and I’m starting to feel straight-up hustled.

Every time, I ordered items that are supposed to come with Monopoly pieces according to the app. Quarter Pounder with Cheese, 10-piece nuggets, breakfast biscuit McChicken, large drinks, McGriddle, Americano coffee — the whole list. Guess what? Most of them didn’t have a single Monopoly piece attached.

It’s like they’re advertising “Monopoly menu” items, but half the time you don’t get anything. I even called one of the stores, and an employee told me they’re *randomly selecting boxes* to have Monopoly stickers — like one out of every two boxes. So basically, they’re still pushing the Monopoly promo but using up old non-promo packaging.

If that’s true, that’s such a scam. Don’t advertise the Monopoly game if customers have a 50/50 shot of actually getting pieces. I’ve *never* once gotten all three Monopoly pieces in one order — it’s always missing something. It honestly feels like they’re rationing out pieces to drag the promotion out.

McDonald’s needs to address this. We’re literally paying for items that are promoted as part of Monopoly, and we’re not getting what’s advertised. Is anyone else seeing the same thing? Let’s all start complaining, because this is ridiculous.

Before:
You didn’t notice, did you?
When I lie awake at night,
Wondering if I mattered to anyone.
Too tired to keep up this fight.

You didn’t notice, did you?
When I smiled to hide the pain,
Trying to be strong for your sake,
While bending until I break.

You didn’t notice, did you?
When I spoke but lost my voice,
Every time I reached for your hand, 
You left me with no choice.

You didn’t notice, did you?
How I fought to find my place,
But every step I tried to take,
Was shadowed by disgrace.

You didn’t notice, did you?
When I thought I wasn’t wanted,
How I begged and screamed 
Yet I was never seen,

You didn’t notice, did you?
When I looked over the ledge.
And took a step-I almost did,
But the next time I might just commit.


After:
Rain's pounding loud in my ears,
The racket of dogs barking, running near,
I sit and scribble, as my mind wonders away,
From the world I’m led astray.


My hands fly over the snow-white page,
An ocean, a moon, a mountain range.
My hands work to bring my imagination to life,
Each vision unfolding, sharp as a knife.


As the first signs of fall draw near,
I sip on coffee as laughter fills the air.
Crimson leaves dance down from their trees,
Carried on the back of a wondering breeze.


This is my happy place, a scattered dream,
Of rain, of pages, of autumn leaves.
Cherish these things for they will not last,
Enjoy them now before they become the past. 


If you’ve made it this far, thank you for coming with me on this journey of through my mind. If you’re wondering the first one is all over the place on purpose because that’s just how I felt in the moment, it was an intense and raw emotion while the wind which is after the fact is more akin to the typical poem you’ll find where it rhymes and flows a lot differently.

I’ve told people about how traumatized I am. It shows in a bunch of my interactions whether I want it to or not so I’d rather not scare them off with it later. I attempt to build healthy relationships with people but I think one of the patterns I’ve found that make me really uncomfortable and make the relationship more hostile to me is when people assume I don’t care about myself enough to take care of myself. I may not get to sleep before 3am or have a set meal schedule but I’m the one who knows me the most. I know that chaotic digital hardcore, break core and getting insanely invested in the details of my art gets those distressing flashbacks out of my head. I know that getting coffee every morning is not the best for my wallet but it gives me something that I can do for myself each day that I can look forward to (I’m not going broke because of it btw that would be a very different conversation). I know that writing the same story for years on end may not be what a lot of writers do but it gives me something that I can hold onto for as long as I want to and I’m still just as passionate and excited about that story than I was as a middle schooler, if not more so. I guess the moral of all this is that different people have different healthy coping mechanisms and strategies. It’s not that I think I’m so edgy and different from others that the coping strategies you find on google when you search up best ways to cope with trauma won’t work but it’s that CPTSD is a completely different beast that a lot of people without the disorder don’t understand. 

Other people see someone who’s dysfunctional or who doesn’t care about their well being and I won’t say I don’t have unconscious or conscious self destructive habits but what I will say is I despise when people think they can micromanage my healing journey just because I’ve shared intimate emotionally vulnerable parts of my life with them in an attempt to build community so I don’t kms out of existential loneliness. I don’t tell these people these things so they can get on me or keep me accountable for my journey nor have I ever said I liked that, I tell them because I want to feel connected to other people in a way that’s familiar to me. I’ve had people say I talk about that stuff all the time when I frankly don’t, yes I talk about it but it’s a big part of my life. My brain is fundamentally altered for life because of all that stuff. It’s like telling someone who grew up without a parent to not talk about it at all because it brings the mood down. To me it’s a part of my life I’ve processed and I have accepted but to them it’s something to be completely avoided because it’s too sad even though they didn’t go through it themselves. It’s really dehumanizing to feel like you can’t talk about the few memories you have from your childhood with others and build community through vulnerability and healthy communication. I just want to create bonds with people that can be silly with me in silly moments and serious with me in serious moments. It would be great if people listened more rather than giving advice or trying to make all my problems go away. 

I’ve been told I’m like glass and I’ve been told that I’m strong for handling all that I have but I’m really just a culmination of all my experiences. Being receptive to that concept and embracing me at whatever moment I’m at makes me feel a lot safer and less likely to overthink/get flashbacks than fighting to mitigate whatever I’m thinking of or experiencing outside my relationship with them. A lot of people in my life only see me as one or a couple of facets of myself despite my attempts to show them all of myself. Oh yeah, I had one person (who ended up being extremely shitty) tell me I needed a different therapist?!? I’m sorry…WHAT that’s not anyone else’s business except for mine and my therapist’s whether I disclose how my therapy sessions go or not. 

To be honest I’ve stopped sharing a lot of my personhood and general hobbies with people because I cant trust them to give space to the things I’ve experienced. This makes me feel extremely disconnected from a lot of the world and it deepens that feeling of existential loneliness I was talking about earlier. I wish I could let go of these people sooner because they aren’t comparable with me and I’m working on that part of myself a lot and I hope to be able to get to a place where I can initiate ending the relationship with them before the relationship becomes toxic.

1o1t0vx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o1t0vx,Brown mold under stove top,"Hi all. I've been living at my current apartment since 2019.I live in a fairly old building above a coffee shop and somewhat complain a lot due to noise from music downstairs and other issues if they arise. Today I found brown mold under the oven stove! I'm not sure if I should bother cleaning this or even how to. I use the oven daily and have absolutely no idea how mold would even grow under the oven top with all the heat coming from the stove top and oven.  I've opened it up before and have noticed rust before if the pilot light would go out.  It's a fairly old oven, no idea how old but never bothered  to do anything about the rust because I wasn't sure there was anything I could do about it. 

Should I clean the oven? How would I be able to? Is the oven even salvageable? Would this be on me? Should I tell the landlord? Should I just outright move?? I'm practically on month to month.  


For context about my experience here:

Been living here since 2019. The place seemed really quiet when i was originally given a tour. This was off hours for the coffee shop of course so i found out shortly after moving in the employees love to play the music irritatingly loud.  The previous landlord has worked with me on noise levels and would have me text him if it would get too loud.  Sometimes the employees didn't care.  Some days were better than others.  Sometimes I'd bang on the floor and would have to have a talking to.  Usually I'd win out. 

Eventually,  2 years ago,  someone else buys the building I'm in and also takes over the coffee shop.  Noise levels start to go back up,  i talk with the new landlord,  seems super reasonable and turns the speakers under my unit that is above the coffee shop kitchen off. Awesome! The landlord  has seemed to replace  the speakers that were close to the ceilings so we, the tenants wouldn't be able to hear the music through the floors. Problem is the new speaker system is on the floor is very bassy and kinda reverberates the building.  If the music gets too loud from the employees,  he just has me text him to try and alleviate the issue. Not sure if this always happens but at least he's willing to try something. I do this more frequently than I'd like and had to do so again yesterday due to being woken up at 430 AM To music. 

Things that also inconvenience me.  Once a month, a boomer band comes in and plays music. I hate live music when I'm forced to listen it.  If it's one a month though,  I can just leave to my parents.  Not the worst thing.   The new owner also does various things for the community and I've had to frequently be out of the back parking lot for the various events they hold. Their seasonal night markets also involve loud music😑

Two fairly bad things have happened with the building itself since August.  A plumbing leak was coming from the ceiling by the front entrance and was causing mold and a weird smell.  So i say something and It got taken care of but of course, the guy who always complains( me)  is the one who finds it. 

Turns out that weird smell was more than likely not from the leak but from the coffee shop kitchen.  I think they were cooking curry or something and it really stunk the place up.  Now since around then, it frequently smells of food and it makes it hard to sleep sometimes due to the smell. In pretty sure I'm inhaling in smoke sometimes too as it smells like things are being burnt . I've been here since 2019 and have never had to deal with the smell of food. Not sure if they even changed the menu much since then.  I can find photos since before the ownership change and can find photos of paninis and hot sandwiches.

 I was going to ask the owner about why we can smell food upstairs but decided to clean the oven just in case the smell was coming from me. Thats how i found the mold. Now since I found the mold, I'm hesitant and  kinda wanna just leave.  I mainly stayed for so long due to how nice the area is and because rent is reasonable.

When he finally took  breath I said I'm an atheist and he just kept rambling on about biblical passages but in a non-confrontational and somewhat friendly way. So I let him ramble on.

OK, so here it is.  He made some comment about the internet and so much information and too much knowledge.  What made this all worth the effort is hearing him sort of use the Bible to justify a suspicion of knowledge.  I've never really thought about this but he really seemed to think the Bible warns people against relying on knowledge.

This kind of blew my mind.  I know the tale of Eve and the serpent already do this, but do other parts of the Bible cast suspicion on knowledge?  Is this the source of religious people's anti-intellectualism?

The Irish coffee (wich I used to regularly say was the best Irish coffee I had ever had.) was..... Fine? 

Was my love of this place clouded by nostalgia? Or have they actually gotten worse.

Fresh-faced and a little lost, I arrived for a new job, thinking of it as just a temporary chapter. Little did I know, those five years would become the most transformative of my life.
I spent my twenties growing up with this city. Bangalore taught me so much—not just about what's good and what's bad, but about resilience, joy, and the beauty of chaos. I had so many firsts here: my first time living alone, my first taste of filter coffee that finally ""clicked,"" and the first friendships that felt like family.


This city took me in and showed me what it was to truly live. It's where I discovered the hidden magic of an early morning walk through Cubbon Park, the comfort of a late-night dosa at a street stall, and the shared camaraderie of being stuck in a classic Bangalore traffic jam. It wasn't always easy, but every challenge and every triumph is now woven into the fabric of who I am.


Now, reading through posts in this sub, a wave of nostalgia washes over me. The old haunts, the familiar street names, the memories—it all comes rushing back. It’s a bittersweet feeling, like flipping through an old photo album and remembering the person you used to be. Bangalore isn't just a place I lived; it's the place that shaped me.


I'm finally coming back for a visit soon, and my heart is already full. I can't wait to walk those streets again, not as the new kid who just arrived, but as someone coming home.

I'd love to hear your suggestions! What places should I absolutely visit, and what foods must I try to get a true taste of Bangalore in 2025?

I did all the troubleshooting and cleaning, but it didn't solve the problem. The only way I could get it to flow through and make a non watery cup of coffee was to use a clamp to squeeze down.

Well, it finally quit completely.It wouldn't do anything wouldn't come on.I could get it to go into cleaning cycle.I powered down.Get everything I needed to do.And it's still to activate.

So I thought I'd give another brand a try, and I have to say, I haven't had a flow through pod cup of coffee this good for a long time.The ninja pods and grounds that I got it is great.

The coffee is so much better and so far I like it.I've only had it for a week.
I figured I'd let everyone know since they are still on sale during prime week.I think I only paid eighty four dollars for this thing.I did get the one without the frother.I didn't need that.",3,1759972154.0,keurig,0,1.0,False

The Suntup version looks spectacular, and I’m sure there are many other beautiful editions beyond that. But I’m more of a Folio Society guy myself.

I’ve already released a video to YT looking at their version of *Animal Farm* with art by Quentin Blake (of Roald Dahl fame), but I just posted a new one comparing their 2001 edition of *Nineteen Eighty-Four* to the 2014 version.

If you have 20 minutes to kill and you don’t mind being moved off-platform, feel free to give it a gander. It is long and focuses on the minutiae around ‘book as object’, so grab a coffee and prepare to camp through it a bit if you are inclined to take the plunge:

The publisher also released a Limited Edition version in 2024, and will debut yet another version - a Standard Edition based on that recent LE - by the end of this year. In the past they’ve also released two boxed sets from Orwell: a five-volume collection of his reportage and a five-volume collection of his novels. Clearly his books make them a rather steady bit of business!

Beyond those from The Folio Society and Suntup Editions, if you know of any other fine editions of Orwell’s work (sewn bindings + original illustrations), please let me know. I’m always on the hunt for more!

Coffee from it tastes very good, almost (or maybe) better than a pour over. But: there’s something different about the brewing process that these espresso machines do that just wires my head up too much, to the point that i am dizzy. Each sip seems to carry a bite with it,; and I cannot drink it and feel any sort of calm or ease. It’s almost like screw this, it’s flipping my head upside down, what’s the point. 

But I’ve switched for a few days to a pour over, and I like bold coffee (dark-medium dark roast) so I make the pour over at about a 1:15+ ratio. And I feel totally comfortable, mind isn’t racing, and especially: not feeling dizziness.  It could all be just projection, maybe the machine adds a certain expectation? Anyone else have similar experiences?
