I need some advice!!! I’m looking for a coffee machine for my bf (we live in Melbourne, love coffee, but don’t have a machine. We do have basic skills and can pull espresso/steam milk but nothing advanced)

I am looking for something $2300AUD or under. I can get a refurbished Lelit Mara for 2k or a Profitec Go for 2300$. I know these machines are different but have just seen them crop up a lot with positive reviews on this sub and elsewhere.

I plan on also getting a really nice grinder.

What would you all recommend? Or, is there another option in the price point?",1,1766710861.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

So, I have been dating this cute girl for 7 months now and since she's a devout Muslim she doesn't believe in sex before marriage or any casual stuff during the relationship. However, I'm not a teenage virgin guy who'd be okay with no intimacy and I have been with women physically. I like this one so much that I forget about sex around her and just like to spend the time. But she's a gorgeous hijabi and an attractive girl so it's natural to wanna express some emotions. One day when we were in a long drive, I made a move and we ended up engaging in a long make out sesh. She was really into it but felt guilty afterwards. She loves the idea of intimacy with me and sometimes we even discuss how it would be in texts. 

She's got her beliefs but it had been becoming difficult for me to manage so I tried to persuade her into expressing ourselves physically. She refused. I understand and respect her thoughts but also felt bad as I don't wanna go to anyone else for my intimate needs. She sensed my dejection the last few days even though I was totally happy just hanging out with her. 

On Christmas eve she asked me that we should meet so we decided that I'll pick her up as usual and we'll go for some coffee and a drive. In the morning she said we should change the plans and that I should meet her at her place as her parents are away for a wedding and she would cook biryani just for us. It was so sweet, I agreed coz she does cook well. I went to her flat without being seen by any neighbor and sneaked into the place. We hugged, she gave me a lil kiss. And this was the first time I was seeing her without a hijab outside of pictures irl. She asked me to sit, I was nervous. Then went inside her room, locked it, and asked me wait. She then called me in, I went in, and to my fucking surprise she laid there in just a cute bra and nothing underneath but just a big gift bow on the crown of her smooth and freshly groomed lady parts 😭😭😭😭😭 

I was shocked and ecstatic and asked her what is all this. She said that she understands my loyalty and would want me to come down and eat her present 🎁 ...I'm typing this from her bedroom as she sleeps, and I've been here since 11am, so you can understand what happened 👀 ..this was too awesome to not share and since I can't on insta or anywhere else, reddit feels like the right place.

1pvrgu6,https://www.reddit.com/r/BookPromotion/comments/1pvrgu6/personal_milestone_releasing_a_book_on/,Personal milestone: releasing a book on cybersecurity,"I hit a small personal milestone recently. After years working across security operations, governance, and assurance, I finally published a book that I have been chipping away at in the background.

What pushed me to write it was a pattern I kept seeing. People entering cybersecurity often get buried in tools, certifications, and tactics very quickly, while the underlying principles are treated as assumed knowledge. 

The book focuses on the foundations that tend to outlast specific technologies. Things like confidentiality, integrity, availability, and how they actually show up in day-to-day decisions. 

If you are curious, the book is called Hacking Cybersecurity Principles. The ebook is currently priced, for a short period, at less than a cup of coffee, and I have put the details here: [https://mybook.to/hack\_cyber\_principles](https://mybook.to/hack_cyber_principles)

Even without the book, my main takeaway from writing it is this: spending time articulating first principles has made me better at my job. It has improved how I mentor juniors, how I justify risk decisions to non-technical stakeholders, and how I adapt when the tooling inevitably changes.

If you are an author thinking about writing in a technical field, my encouragement would be to start from the problems you keep explaining over and over at work. That repetition is usually a sign there is something worth capturing more clearly.",1,1766710623.0,BookPromotion,0,1.0,False
1pvrgk5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CostaRicaTravel/comments/1pvrgk5/costa_rica_vs_mexico/,Costa Rica vs Mexico,"For the regular visitors of Mexico thinking about visiting Costa Rica, these are my first impressions. I'll admit my bar was set pretty high because of all the positive things I heard about the country, but I was pretty disappointed with it overall.

I do think it had a safer feel than Mexico, and it was much much cleaner both in the Urban areas and out in the rural areas. I never got eyeballed by the police like I do in Mexico, and the police I did see were few and far between. It was a beautiful country with some amazing views up by Monteverde. I really liked that area. It was almost like Switzerland had a love child with the rainforest. If I do ever return, I'll spend more time there. The people overall were very nice and polite, I had a meal at a soda in the central market of Liberia and the locals seemed entertained that a tourist was eating there. A few came up and asked how the food was and where I was from.

Here are my key detractors.

Climate - For most of my trip I was in the dry part of the country(Guanacaste) during the dry season, but at times the humidity was almost unbearable. I met a woman from SLC who was a regular in CR and she said this was super nice weather with low humidity compared to March/April. Yuck.

Travel Times - I had a rental car, but it still took forever to go anywhere. Most of the ""highways"" between moderate sized cities are narrow, rough, and plugged up by large truck and bus traffic. Max speed limits were 60 km/hr which is about 40 mph. The average limit was 40 km/hr and the minimum I saw was 25 km/hr. They almost need these low speed limits due to the amount of foot traffic, animals, vehicles without working lights, and bicyclists on the main roads. The roads were not well maintained at all. They make highway 1 in the Baja look like pristine infrastructure.

Food - I only had one great meal down there eating out 1-2 times a day at places rated 4.5 or better on google. Everything else was mediocre at best, and the prices were the same or higher than back home in the states and more expensive than most restaurants in Mexico. When I'm in Mexico I can eat just about anywhere that has decent ratings and get an amazing meal. Sometimes they're dirt cheap too. The Mexican food I tried in Costa Rica was Tex Mex style, not even close to authentic. I spoke to a Chef from the 4 seasons who was dining at the one exceptional place and he said the food quality situation down there was poor. There is so much demand with the surge in tourism and snowbirds that the market is flooded with mediocre restaurants. 

Cost - Prices for everything was high. Food (groceries & restaurants), Coffee, Beer, Fuel, Activities. The only thing cheap was accommodations and airfare, but I think that's because I hit it a couple of weeks before peak season started. All the activities were stupid expensive. Admission to anything in La Fortuna was at least $30 with most hovering close to $100 and almost all the eco centered ""things to do"" were privatized with admission being charged. I overheard what they charge for fishing charters and those prices were more expensive than Cabo and about the same prices as Hawaii. Fishing tackle was 2-3x the price as back home, where in Mexico it's about the same price as back in the states. 

Beggars/Scammers - I can't recollect the last time I was hit up in the Baja for money or had people trying to charge me to ""watch my car"". Costa Rica was non-stop. I was hitting the beaches at 5 am for fishing, I left my rental parked in the public parking area completely void of anything of value with not a single soul around, and when I'd go to leave at 8am some person in a high vis vest would come up demanding payment for ""watching my car"". They literally could have showed up 10 minutes before I got back. The vest wearing parking attendants were everywhere. I literally passed on stopping places so I didn't have to interact with them.  I also had local swipe my Sunglasses right at my feet after the fell off my chest while fishing. I can leave my stuff sitting 50 yards away on the beach down in Mexico and nobody messes with it. 

Culture - Overall, the culture seemed to focus on existence rather than loving life like what I've experienced in Mexico over the years. It was kind of a shock really. Mexico this time of the year is filled with celebrations and decorations for Christmas, locals out and about celebrating and dancing, and I barely saw anything down in Costa Rica. I covered a lot of ground. It was kind of weird actually. Maybe Mexico is better at putting on a show for the tourists. 

Coffee - Seriously Costa Rica??? I didn't have one exceptional cup of coffee down there. In fact, the best cup I had was at the airport from a machine waiting for my flight out. I went to two highly rated roasters and multiple other coffee shops. It was all average at best. I literally make better cups at home with Starbucks beans(free with my work travel points) and my chemex. Are they sending all the best stuff out of the country?

Water - This was a major plus, having clean drinking water was nice. Not having to worry about forgetting to use bottled water or wondering what the restaurant is using to prep their meals is nice. 

Conclusion - Costa Rica is past the hidden gem tourism reputation it has. It's all the expense of the States and Mexico, with very few reasons to justify the cost. Bang for the buck travel wise, it's on the lower end of the places I've been all over the world. I hear Nicaragua is now what Costa Rica was 20 years ago, but I think I'm going to stick to the Baja for my winter vacations. ",0,1766710599.0,CostaRicaTravel,0,0.33,False

1pvrcwu,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pvrcwu/my_job_is_to_watch_a_priest_pray/,My job is to watch a priest pray,"The job opening wasn’t on LinkedIn, nor was it on any job board. It was handwritten in blue ballpoint pen on the back of a tax receipt pinned to the bulletin board of a 24-hour laundromat in downtown São Paulo.

""NIGHT WATCHMAN - PRIVATE SECTOR. $18,000.00/month + Bonuses. Requirements: No family, military or security background, strong stomach. Discreet. Contact the number below via Telegram only.""

Eighteen thousand dollars.

I read the number three times. At the time, I was living in a boarding house room that smelled of mold and old cooking oil. My bank account had been in the red for so long the manager didn’t even call me anymore. I’m an ex-military police officer, expelled from the force for ""excessive use of force"" and ""incompatible conduct"" (official code for alcoholism).

I had nothing to lose. I sent the message.

The reply came in thirty seconds. A GPS coordinate and a time: 03:00 AM.

The location was the underground garage of an abandoned commercial building in the Sé district. I was frisked by two men built like wardrobes wearing cheap suits. They took my phone, my wallet, my watch. They put a black hood over my head and shoved me into the back of a van.

They drove for four hours. From the swaying and the smell of earth coming through the vents, we left the city and hit a dirt road. Then, we went down. We went down a lot. I felt the pressure in my ears change, like when a plane lands.

When the hood was removed, I was in a white, sterile room lit by fluorescent bulbs.

Sitting at a metal table was Dr. Arantes. A thin man with gray skin and dark circles under his eyes so deep they looked like bruises. He didn’t smile. He didn’t greet me. He just pushed a stack of papers toward me.

“Level 5 Non-Disclosure Agreement,” he said, his voice dry as sand. “If you tell anyone what you see here, you don’t go to jail. You disappear. Your dental records vanish. Your birth certificate is erased. You never existed. Understood?”

“What is the job?” I asked, holding the pen. “Politician security? Organ trafficking?”

“Theological Containment Monitoring.”

I laughed. I thought it was a joke.

Arantes didn’t laugh.

“The salary is deposited into an offshore account in the Cayman Islands. You work 12 hours a day, 6 days a week. You sleep here. You eat here. Your life outside is over. Sign or leave.”

I signed. My hand shook a little, not from fear, but from alcohol withdrawal.

Arantes gathered the papers and stood up.

“Welcome to Project Cathedral. Let’s go down.”

We entered an industrial freight elevator. The panel had no numbers, just an up button and a down button. We descended for too long. Two minutes? Three?

“We are three hundred meters below the foundation of an 18th-century church,” Arantes explained, staring at the elevator ceiling. “The church above is a façade. What matters is what’s below.”

When the doors opened, the air was freezing. We walked down a concrete corridor lined with steel doors fitted with biometric locks. We reached the end of the hall. A control room.

It was small, claustrophobic, filled with high-resolution monitors, panels with blinking lights, and an industrial coffee maker. But the focus of the room was the window. A pane of reinforced glass, ten centimeters thick, looking into a gray concrete cell.

“That is your post,” Arantes pointed to the worn leather chair in front of the glass. “Sit.”

I obeyed. I looked through the glass.

The cell was a perfect concrete cube, maybe 4x4 meters. No furniture. No bed. No toilet. In the center, on a Persian rug that must have once been red but was now dark brown, a man was kneeling.

He was facing away from me. He wore a black cassock, torn and dirty. His hair was white, thin, falling over his gaunt shoulders. He was rocking his body slightly, back and forth.

“Who is he?” I asked.

“We call him Father Thomas. He is 94 years old. He has been in that room for forty-two years.”

“A prisoner?”

“Working. Just like you.”

Arantes flipped a switch on the panel. Sound invaded the control room.

It wasn’t silence. It was a low, constant hum, like a swarm of bees inside a cave.

“...Khlerrr-thum-nagh... Sssrr-aaa-tuh... Mmm-glll-w'nah...”

“Is he praying?” I asked, feeling a chill run up my spine. That language didn’t sound human. The consonants were too hard, too guttural.

“He is vocalizing,” Arantes corrected. “It’s a sonic blockade. A specific frequency. As long as he maintains this rhythm, the Door stays closed.”

“What door?”

Arantes ignored the question and pointed to the panel in front of me. There were three large buttons, protected by acrylic covers. Blue, Yellow, and Red.

“Pay attention, Jonas. These are your only responsibilities. The priest does not eat, does not drink water by mouth, does not sleep. He receives nutrition and stimulants intravenously. He wears high-absorption geriatric diapers that we change with robots every 24 hours. Your function is to ensure he does not stop. Ever.”

Arantes pointed to the Blue Button.

“Hydration and mild stimulant. If his voice falters, if he coughs, press Blue.”

Then he pointed to the Yellow Button.

“Shock of adrenaline and pure amphetamine. If he stops rocking. If his head droops. If it looks like he’s going to pass out. Press Yellow. It will hurt him a little. His heart will race to 200 beats per minute. But it will keep him awake.”

“And the Red one?” I asked. The button was larger than the others, with a black and yellow striped warning border.

Arantes looked at the cell. For the first time, I saw fear in that man’s eyes.

“If he dies. If the sound stops for more than ten seconds. If you see... things coming out of the floor. Press Red.”

“What does it do?”

“Total incineration. The cell is flooded with flammable corrosives. Everything inside turns to ash in three seconds.”

“So, that button basically kills him?”

“If we reach that point, Jonas, the priest doesn’t matter anymore. The Red is to seal the room. To ensure nothing comes out.”

Arantes put a hand on my shoulder.

“The shift is 12 hours. Do not sleep. The system monitors your eyes. If you close them for more than five seconds, the chair shocks you. Good luck.”

The first few months were a slow descent into madness. Boredom is the worst kind of torture. You sit there, staring at a dying old man, listening to that sound.

“...Khlerrr-thum-nagh...”

It isn’t a Christian prayer. I was raised in the church. I know Latin. That was older than Latin. It sounded like the language stones would speak if they had mouths.

I started studying Father Thomas. With the camera zoom, I saw details the glass hid. The skin on his knees didn’t exist anymore. The fabric of the cassock, the flesh, and the rug had fused into a mash of dried blood and pus. He was calcified to the floor. That old man couldn’t stand up even if he wanted to.

His hands, clasped in prayer, had nails grown long and curved, piercing the flesh of his own palms.

But the worst was the face. Every now and then, he would turn his head to the side in a spasm. He had no eyes. The sockets were empty, scarred holes. Someone—or he himself—had gouged them out years ago. And the mouth... the lips were open sores from so much friction.

In the fourth week, I found a ""Journal"" on the control room computer. It was a text file hidden in a system folder. Previous monitors left notes.

Monitor Silva (2015): ""He spoke to me today. Not the prayer. He whispered my name. The audio was off, but I read his lips. How does he know my name?""

Monitor Kowalski (2019): ""The shadows in the cell are wrong. The light comes from above, but the priest’s shadow points to the left. And sometimes, the shadow moves when he is still.""

Monitor Helena (2023): ""I dreamed of what is below. It is an ocean. But not of water. Of teeth. Thomas isn’t praying to God. He is singing to put the baby to sleep.""

Helena lasted three months. The log said ""Termination for medical reasons (psychotic break).""

I started doubting my own sanity. The sound of the prayer entered my dreams. I would wake up in my quarters (a concrete room on the same floor) whispering just like the priest. My throat hurt, as if I had been screaming all night.

In the sixth month, the routine was broken.

It was 02:00 AM. I was fighting sleep, drinking cold coffee.

Father Thomas stopped.

The silence in the room was like a gunshot. The audio monitor showed the flatline of silence. I jumped in my chair, hand hovering over the Blue Button.

But before I could press it, he spoke. In Portuguese. With a clear, young voice that shouldn’t have come out of that destroyed throat.

“Jonas.”

I froze. He was facing away, but I knew he was ""looking"" at me with those empty sockets.

“Press the Yellow, Jonas,” the voice said. “I need strength. He is waking up.”

I didn’t think. I pressed the Yellow Button.

I heard the hiss of the automatic injector in the cell. The priest’s body convulsed violently. His back arched at an impossible angle. I heard bones crack. He screamed—a dry, airless scream—and went back to praying.

But now, the rhythm was frantic. Too fast.

“KhlerrrthumnaghSsrrraaatuuhhMmmglllwnah...”

He sounded like a demonic rapper. The frequency rose. The reinforced glass in front of me began to vibrate.

The red phone on my desk rang. I didn’t even know that phone worked. I answered.

“What did you do?” It was Arantes’ voice. He sounded like he was just waking up.

“He asked for it! He stopped! I followed protocol!”

“The seismic activity level just spiked! You injected too much adrenaline! His heart won’t take it!”

I looked at the vital signs monitor. Heart rate: 210 bpm. Blood pressure: 240/150. The priest was going to explode.

“He is rising!” the priest shouted, breaking the prayer again.

This time, he turned. He rotated his torso 180 degrees. His spine snapped, breaking, but he turned. The eyeless face stared at me. He smiled. Black blood ran from his mouth.

“The door, Jonas. The door is creaking.”

And then, the floor of the cell gave way. It wasn’t a hole. The concrete simply became... liquid. The rug where the priest was kneeling sank. I saw Father Thomas’s body being swallowed by the earth. He didn’t scream. He kept praying as he sank into the gray slime bubbling on the floor.

The prayer became muffled, gurgling, until it vanished completely.

The heart monitor beeped. Flatline.

The sound stopped.

“Arantes!” I screamed into the phone. “He’s gone! The floor swallowed him!”

“The Red!” Arantes shouted. “PRESS THE DAMN RED BUTTON NOW!”

I lifted the acrylic cover. I punched the button. I closed my eyes, waiting for the flash of flammable chemicals, the heat, the explosion that would incinerate everything on the other side of the glass.

But... nothing happened.

The button didn’t work.

I opened my eyes. The cell wasn’t on fire. The cell was glowing.

A sickly violet light emanated from the hole in the floor where the priest had sunk. The temperature in my control room began to rise. 30 degrees. 40 degrees. The plastic on the monitors started to melt. The phone in my hand melted, burning my palm. I dropped it.

And then, the Thing began to emerge.

First, it was the fingers. Long, translucent claws, made of something that looked like smoking glass and TV static. They gripped the edge of the hole in the concrete. The size... my God. Each finger was the size of a grown human.

Then, the head. It had no face. A polygon of flesh and light that constantly changed shape. Looking at it made my eyes bleed. I felt hot, red tears running down my face.

The central computer in the room came to life. A text message appeared on the main screen, giant green letters on a black background.

CONTAINMENT SYSTEM FAILED.

OMEGA PROTOCOL INITIATED.

MANDATORY REPLACEMENT.

The doors to my control room locked. Titanium bars slammed down over the exit. A mechanical needle descended from the ceiling, right above my chair. I tried to get up, but the chair had magnetic locks on the wrists and ankles. They snapped shut with a metallic click.

I was trapped.

“No! No! Let me out!” I screamed.

The needle descended and pierced my neck. I felt a cold liquid invade my veins. It wasn’t poison.

It was clarity.

Suddenly, the fear vanished. The pain vanished. My mind expanded.

I understood.

I understood what Father Thomas was doing. He wasn’t praying to a God. He wasn’t asking for salvation. He was telling a story.

The Entity... Whatever that thing coming out of the hole was... is made of chaos. It is pure entropy. It wants to undo the universe, atom by atom. The only thing keeping it trapped is Order. And the purest form of Order is Repetition. Rhythm. The Word.

The ""prayer"" wasn’t magic. It was mathematics. A sequence of frequencies creating a physical barrier against chaos. A wall of solid sound.

But Thomas had stopped. The wall had fallen. Someone needed to raise the wall again.

The Thing in the cell was rising. It already occupied half the space. The concrete walls were cracking, turning to dust. If it touched the ceiling, if it touched the foundation of the church above... the world would end. Not in fire, but in silence. Everything would cease to exist.

I felt the words rising in my throat. I didn’t know them. But they were in the serum the needle injected. Liquid memory. The knowledge of all the monitors, of all the ""priests"" before Thomas.

My mouth opened against my will. My tongue twisted into a painful knot. The sound came out ragged, weak.

The Thing in the cell stopped. The spinning geometry hesitated. It ""looked"" at me through the glass.

I felt a crushing pressure on my brain, like an ocean trying to fit into a water glass.

“SHUT UP, WORM,” the Thing’s voice echoed in my mind. It was pure murderous intent.

But I couldn’t shut up. The drug in my blood wouldn’t let me. The biological imperative was now: Pray or die.

“Khlerrr-thum-nagh...” I spoke louder.

The Thing recoiled an inch. The black slime on the floor bubbled. It hated the sound. The sound was Order. The sound was a cage.

The Thing let out a screech that blew out the remaining monitors in the room. Glass flew everywhere, cutting my face. But I didn’t stop.

The rhythm took me.

My body began to rock, back and forth, mimicking Thomas’s movement. It was the only way to pump the diaphragm to keep my breath.

The Thing began to shrink. The violet light dimmed. It was being pushed back into the hole by the weight of my words. It fought. Claws scratched the reinforced glass, leaving deep gouges right in front of my face.

But I kept going.

It sank. Slowly, inch by inch, the nightmare returned to the earth. The concrete floor, which had been liquid, began to solidify again, sealing the hole.

In ten minutes, the cell was empty. Only the dirty rug and Thomas’s bloodstains remained.

I sat there, panting, trapped in the chair. I waited for the doors to open. I waited for Arantes to come get me out, congratulate me, give me my money.

But the doors didn’t open.

The needle in my neck injected another dose. Nutrients. Water. Stimulants.

The intercom clicked on.

“Excellent work, Jonas,” Arantes voice said. “The transition was smoother than we expected. Thomas took three days to find the rhythm the first time.”

“Get me out of here!” I tried to scream, but the words didn’t come out. My throat was locked in ""prayer"" mode. I could only make the guttural sounds.

“You cannot leave,” Arantes continued, calm. “The frequency must be maintained within line of sight. The glass is the focusing lens. You are the new projector. The audio system was destroyed, Jonas. Now, it is just your voice. Direct into the room’s acoustics.”

The lights in the control room went out. Only a dim light remained on, illuminating the empty cell on the other side of the glass.

And a new button lit up on the panel in front of me. A button that injected water into my mouth through a tube that came out of the headrest.

“The contract was for life, Jonas. You should have read the fine print. 'Monitoring and Containment'. You are the Containment now.”

That was... I don’t know how long ago. There is no clock here.

My knees hurt, even though I’m sitting. I feel like they are trying to fuse to the chair. My eyes burn. I don’t blink anymore. And my voice... my voice isn’t mine anymore. It is a constant hum, an organic machine built to keep the demon sleeping.

Sometimes, when exhaustion hits and I slow the rhythm, I see it. The floor of the cell starts to sweat that black slime. And I hear its voice, from down below, laughing at me.

“Sing, little bird. Sing until your throat tears. I have all the time in the world. And you only have one life.”

My name was Jonas. Now, I am just the sound.

God help us.

Even if I’m waiting for 20 minutes. Are my dating standards too high?,"We’re all 30. Most of the men I’ve dated just haven’t felt very gentlemanly to me, and weirdly, my female friends feel way more so. Not in a romantic way obviously, but in basic social awareness and consideration.

I recently broke up with a guy (he refuses to believe it still) I was seeing and looking back, it was the accumulation of small things that constantly irritated me. For example (this is one of many), he’ll push to meet really intensely, and I’d suggest meeting at Starbucks and he’d immediately push for “we should just make coffee at home.” Meanwhile he literally has over 5k Starbucks stars (200 stars per drink) on his account - meaning he goes to Starbucks when I’m not around. It wasn’t even about money, it just felt dismissive of what I wanted.

When we did go, if I was waiting in line to buy my coffee (he won’t order anything), he would never wait in line with me. He’d sit down even when there was no need to save a table, or just wander off somewhere. It’s almost like he didn’t want to be associated with buying coffee, or worse, thought I might expect him to pay. I didn’t. It was just awkward. And even if I’m waiting for 10+ minutes for my coffee, he won’t come up and talk to me.

What really made it click for me was last week - when a girlfriend went to Starbucks with me. I really needed coffee, she doesn’t even drink coffee or tea, and without thinking she just stood in line with me the whole time. There was no sulking, no disappearing, no weird energy. It felt oddly refreshing and supportive in a way I hadn’t felt on dates.

Now I’m questioning if I’m being too sensitive or if this is actually a reasonable expectation. To me, waiting in line together feels like basic courtesy (I’m also long distance with this guy - he moved! So already don’t see him much). Am I expecting too much, or are my standards just shifting after realizing how considerate my friends are compared to the men I’ve dated?

Would love outside perspectives. This is one example of many where it’s “his way or the highway”. If he wants to see a movie, he won’t ask me if I’m interested and give me 2-3 to choose from. He’ll just say “i was thinking we can see Avatar next week. I’ll get us tickets” without asking me if I’m interested or have 4 hours to sit through a movie.

Edit: people have told me to explicitly tell him he has to wait in line with me or else it’s a dealbreaker. The thing is, I can’t help but feel like he doesn’t actually like me (he supposedly does) if he’s ok with leaving me in line + picking up my order for 20+ minutes. Meanwhile the whole date is like 2 hours.",1,1766709990.0,Advice,6,1.0,False

1pvr6aq,https://www.reddit.com/r/accountability/comments/1pvr6aq/sf_south_bay_accountability_buddy_wanted_yoga/,"#SF South Bay accountability buddy wanted: yoga, running, and living our best lives 😀😀 Prefer 35 to 50 and local!","
I’m a techie in the South Bay area trying to build better mind + body habits—and realizing that doing it solo is about as effective as meditating during a caffeine crash. So here I am, bravely asking the internet for an accountability buddy.

What I’m hoping we keep each other honest about:

Mind - no incense required ;)
Positive mindset check-ins, swapping book/podcast recs, occasional “wow Mondays are whack” conversations, aiming for progress, not toxic positivity.

Body (fun > punishment)!!
Yoga (vinyasa fan)
Running (trail jogs at Shoreline Park? 10/10)
Healthy food vibes…meal prep, farmers’ markets, new recipes that don’t involve kale every single time (but I love Kale)

Accountability that doesn’t suck! 
Weekly check-ins via text/DM, virtual high-fives for wins, gentle nudges when motivation disappears. Open to occasional in-person things like yoga, a run, or coffee/green juice while we recap our heroic efforts.

About me: enthusiastic but not intense, consistency over-perfection. Former triathlete…still do one a year. Bonus points if you use Strava and/or LoseIt! but zero pressure.

1pvr4yd,https://www.reddit.com/r/OALangBaAko/comments/1pvr4yd/oa_lang_ba_ako_naiirita_ako_sa_bf_kong_ginising/,OA lang ba ako? Naiirita ako sa bf kong ginising pa rin ako for sex kahit na gising na rin sa sala nanay ko??,"Bf came over for Christmas. Sanay siya sa privacy kasi usually when he comes over, pinapagamit ni mama samin yung mas maliit (at detached from the main house) na bahay for our privacy. Cool naman nanay ko, there's implicit basbas naman for the two of us at di naman siya pinanganak kahapon. Also I wish to live a childfree life so baka mga pinagdadasal niya pang majontes ako secretly (lighthearted).  

Unfortunately this year, yung maliit na bahay is rented out to others. Kaya we stayed on a room sa main house with less privacy. Nung umpisa I tried to impose na cuddle lang no funny business, kasi personally di rin ako maka-get into the mood without full privacy (uncomfortable ako to do it thinking of the possibility that other people around might hear us). Pero syempre in the course of days leading up to Christmas di maiwasan dun din punta even if I'm not 100% into it, I ended up giving my okay as long as we stay quiet and tulog mga tao sa bahay.  

Another context is we have CNC arrangement na bf can initiate even if I'm asleep. In the last couple of days or so he'd always wake me up around 4ish in the morning which is fine with me kasi tulog pa mga tao.  

This morning he woke me up at 8am. I thought it was just 6am kasi cloudy ang weather sa labas so skirting the line a bit but akala ko tulog pa rin mga tao. After doing the deed I stepped out to drink water sana when I saw my mom already having her morning coffee sa sala. Para akong binuhusan ng malamig na tubig. Bf knows I don't like to do it pag gising na mga tao but he still did it. I feel disrespected and also I feel like a piece of shit. I can't shake off the feeling of dread in the pit of my stomach, the fact that I turned into someone who'd have sex within my fam's hearing vicinity (hoping that's not the case cuz I was still careful being quiet) and also the fact that my bf disrespected my boundary since impossible na di niya alam when he woke up earlier than me and should have heard my mom moving around.  

And it's also not the first time. In other aspects of our relationship, whenever I give him an inch he'd keep insisting to take a mile and cross my line. I feel so off about this. OA lang ba ako?",1,1766709613.0,OALangBaAko,0,1.0,False
1pvr4xq,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1pvr4xq/i_didnt_apply_for_the_internal_role_part_1/,I didn’t apply for the internal role. (Part 1),"I didn’t realize it at the time, but that email was the moment my life stopped being ordinary.  
  
The alarm went off at 6:30. I didn’t wake up right away. I never do.



For a few seconds, I was convinced I could just stay there. That if I didn’t move, the day would not start yet. The ceiling above my bed has a faint crack running from the corner toward the light fixture. I have watched it long enough to know exactly where it fades out. I don’t remember when I noticed it the first time. Just that it has always been there when I needed something to stare at.



I hit snooze.



When the alarm went off again, that was the one I actually woke up to. Not because it was louder, just because by then the math had already settled in. If I didn’t get up now, I would be late. If I was late, I would lose the overtime hours. If I lost the overtime, the bills would not line up the way I needed them to. I sighed and sat up. The floor was cold. I noticed that immediately. I always do.



I shuffled into the kitchen and hit the coffee maker without really looking at it. I had set it up the night before. Grounds measured. Water filled. Like a small gift to my future groggy self. The coffee finished brewing while I leaned against the counter and waited. It smelled fine. Not good. Not bad. Just enough caffeine to keep me conscious while I stared at a screen for the next eight hours. I grabbed the same chipped mug I have had since college. The handle is a little loose now. I keep meaning to replace it. I never do.



As I watched the coffee pot finish, for a moment it reminded me of a different kitchen. Smaller. Messier. Too many people packed into it at once. Back when coffee meant staying up late on purpose. I was in college then. I remember thinking I was exhausted all the time, which feels funny now. I had no idea what tired actually felt like yet. I drank terrible coffee back then too. Burnt. Too strong. Always cold by the time I finished it. But it felt different. It felt like fuel. I had plans then. Not big cinematic ones. Just enough to feel like I was moving toward something. I remember sitting in a lecture hall one morning, half asleep, writing ideas in the margins of my notebook instead of taking notes. Nothing concrete. Just possibilities. I thought I would figure things out as I went. I truly believed that. I believed effort mattered. That showing up would eventually turn into momentum. That if I kept trying, even badly, something would open up. I don’t remember what I thought that something was. Just that it felt close.



The coffee maker clicked off, and the sound pulled me back. Same kitchen. Same counter. Same mug with the loose handle. I took a sip. It tasted fine.



I don’t think that version of me was wrong. I think they just didn’t know how long eventually could be. Standing there in my kitchen, holding mediocre coffee, I didn’t feel bitter. I felt patient. Like maybe I hadn’t missed my chance. Like things don’t stop being fixable just because they take longer than you expected. While the coffee cooled, I checked my phone. No messages. No missed calls. Just the usual reminders. Payments due. Pending. Overdue. I have gotten a few disconnect warnings over the past couple of months. Nothing serious yet. Still fixable. That is what mattered right now. Everything was still fixable.



“I am not unhappy.”



I needed to say it out loud. I think people confuse tired with miserable. I have a job. It’s not exciting, but it is stable. I have an apartment. It is small, but it is quiet. I can pay most of my bills on time. The rest, I am working on. Some days, when I let myself think about it, I actually believe things could get better. Not dramatically. Not all at once. Just incrementally. I rinsed out the mug and set it upside down in the rack. The handle wobbled. I adjusted it.



Riley was already on the bus when I got on, sitting in the same seat by the window. She glanced up from her phone and smiled.



“You’ re cutting it close,” she said. “Still counts,” I told her. She hummed like she agreed. The ride passed quietly. Riley pointed out a new sign someone had put up near the corner store. A dog stubbornly refusing to walk. Small things. The kind you only notice when you have someone to notice them with. We got off at the stop near work and walked the last block together.



By the time we reached the parking lot, the others were already there. Julian stood a little apart, leaning against his car, watching the building like he always did. Caleb leaned against his car with a cup of coffee in hand. “Morning,” he said when he saw me. “Morning.” Paige’s car pulled in a little too fast, brakes squeaking as she slid into her usual spot. She jumped out, keys already in hand, hair still damp like she had rushed out the door. “Don’t start,” she said immediately, pointing at us before anyone could speak. “I wasn’t going to say anything,” Riley replied. “I was just going to look at you like this.” She crossed her arms and tilted her head dramatically. “Traffic,” Paige said. “Every day,” Julian added. “Same road. Same time.” “Yeah,” Paige said. “But today it was personal.”



I smiled without realizing I was doing it.



Caleb stood the way he always did. Relaxed without looking careless. Coffee cup held low, like it was part of the morning rather than something he needed. Julian stayed a step apart from the rest of us, hands in his pockets, eyes moving more than his body. Like he was already paying attention to something the rest of us hadn’t noticed yet. Paige never fully stopped moving. Even now, she shifted her weight, keys tight in her hand, hair pulled back too quickly to be intentional. Riley leaned into the moment without effort. Arms crossed loosely. Expression already halfway into a joke. She caught my eye and lifted her brows, like she saw me noticing. For a second, everything felt exactly where it was supposed to be.



Caleb took a sip of his coffee. “Anyone else think the break room coffee tastes worse when you’re already tired?” “That implies it tasted good at some point,” Julian said. “It’s not coffee,” Riley said. “It is brown encouragement.”



We all laughed. Not loud. Not forced. The kind of laugh that just happens. We stood there a few seconds longer than we needed to. No one said we were waiting. No one had to. There used to be more of us. Not all at once. One at a time. Different reasons. Different exits.



Ethan didn’t move away. Not really. He just started missing things. Then avoiding them. Then choosing work over us in a way that felt deliberate instead of necessary. We told ourselves it was temporary. He told us it was. Eventually it stopped feeling like distance and started feeling like a decision. Grace got busy in a way that made everything else fall to the side. Archer just drifted. No argument. No goodbye. Just fewer replies until there were not any. Not everyone faded out quietly. One of them left in a way that made noise. We said things we cannot unsay. And then we stopped saying anything at all.



We do not talk about that one. We do not need to.



Paige checked the time. We all did the same. Habit. “Alright,” she said with a sigh. “Let us go make money.” We split off toward the building. Different doors. Same place. Work passed the way it usually does. Emails. Meetings. A box of stale, store bought donuts someone brought in because it was their turn. At the end of the day, I felt tired but not empty. The good kind of tired. The kind that makes you believe rest will help.



That night, lying in the dark, I thought about the people I had stood with that morning. Riley came first, the way she usually did. She had a way of pointing things out that made the world feel bigger instead of heavier. Like there were still options I hadn’t exhausted yet. She talked about possibilities the way other people talked about weather. Casual. Inevitable. Worth noticing. Paige was harder to pin down, mostly because she never put herself in the center of anything. She just kept track. Of people. Of moods. Of when someone hadn’t shown up in a while. If the group felt steady, it was usually because she had adjusted something quietly without asking for credit. Julian noticed things before the rest of us did. Not in a dramatic way. Just small inconsistencies. Tiny patterns that didn’t quite line up. He didn’t always share what he saw, but when he did, it was because it mattered. I trusted his silences almost as much as his words.



And then there was Caleb.



Caleb was steady in a way that didn’t ask for attention. The kind of person who made plans and followed through. The kind who stayed where he said he would. He didn’t talk much about the future, but when he did, it sounded like something that could actually happen.



I trusted them. All of them. In different ways. That felt important. I didn’t know why. I stared at the ceiling for a while longer, tracing the familiar crack with my eyes. Then I rolled onto my side, pulled the blanket up to my chin, and let the day go. Whatever tomorrow was going to be, I would deal with it when it arrived. For now, this was enough.



By the time Riley and I reached the parking lot the next morning, most of the others were already there. Julian stood near the edge like he always did, hands in his pockets, watching the building without really looking at it. Caleb leaned against his car, scrolling through his phone, coffee balanced easily in one hand. Paige was pacing a short line between two parked cars, like she had something she was waiting to say. “Hey,” Riley greeted everyone, lifting her hand as we approached. “Morning,” I said. Paige turned toward us immediately. “Okay. News.”



That was enough to pull everyone’s attention in at once.



“Two people in my department got promoted,” she said. “Officially. New titles. Better pay.” Riley blinked. “Already? Didn’t they just restructure?” “That is what I thought,” Paige said. “But apparently they’re fast tracking some positions” she shrugged. Caleb glanced up from his phone. “They have been quietly posting internal listings for weeks.” He turned his phone to show the group. Julian nodded once. “I noticed that too.”



I hadn’t.



Paige looked at me. “I thought of you when I heard.” Something in my chest lifted before I could stop it. “Me?” I asked. “Yeah,” she said. “You would be perfect for something like that. You already do half of what those roles require.” Riley smiled at me like it was obvious. “She’s not wrong.” I laughed, a little embarrassed, but I didn’t deflect the way I usually would. I let the thought sit there for a second.



Maybe. The word felt dangerous and exciting all at once.



“That would be nice,” I said. And I meant it. Caleb met my eyes briefly, then nodded. “It would.” We stood there a few seconds longer than necessary, the way we always did. No one rushing. No one checking the time yet. Eventually, Paige sighed and glanced at her watch. “Alright. If we do not go in now, I am going to be late for something I already do not want to be at.” “Fiiiiineeeee,” Riley said with an over exaggerated sigh. We laughed, and then we split off toward the building. Still different doors. Still the same place.



The building felt the same as it always did when I walked in. Same fluorescent hum. Same muted conversations drifting down the hallway. Nothing about the place looked different. But it felt different. I caught myself paying closer attention than usual. Listening in meetings instead of just attending them. Noticing which names came up when people talked about new projects or internal shifts. I didn’t push myself forward. I also didn’t shrink back.



At my desk, I opened my email and scanned through the usual messages. Deadlines. Reminders. A calendar invite I had already half forgotten about.



And then I saw it. An internal posting. Nothing flashy. Just a quiet line in the subject header about role expansion and departmental support.



Normally, I would have archived it without thinking. Instead, I opened it. The description felt familiar. Responsibilities I already handled. Skills I had picked up over time without ever really naming them. The kind of work that didn’t feel like a stretch so much as a shift. I re-read it twice before I realized I was smiling. I didn’t apply. Not yet. But I bookmarked it. That felt like something.



Later, in a meeting that usually faded into the background, someone asked a question that no one answered right away. I found myself speaking up before I had talked myself out of it. My voice didn’t shake. No one looked surprised. The conversation moved on, but something lingered.



At lunch, Paige stopped by my desk under the pretense of borrowing a pen. “You look different today,” she said. “Different how?” I asked. She smiled. “Like you are thinking about something.” I shrugged, but I didn’t deny it.



Riley sent me a message a little later. Nothing important. Just a joke about the vending machine eating her money again. I laughed out loud before I realized I was doing it. The afternoon passed more quickly than usual. By the time my shift ended, I wasn’t exhausted in the way I normally was. I felt alert. Like I had leaned forward instead of bracing myself. Walking out of the building, I caught my reflection in the glass doors. I looked the same. But something underneath felt newly awake. I didn’t know what I was going to do with that yet. But for the first time in a while, it felt like a choice.



The bus was quieter on the way back. Most people stared at their phones or leaned their heads against the windows, the day already starting to drain out of them. Riley sat beside me like she always did, one leg tucked under the other, scrolling without really looking at anything. “You were happier today,” she said after a while. “Was I?” She nodded. “In a subtle thinking way. Not a bad way.” I watched the city slide past the window. Storefronts I recognized. Corners I could name without trying. “I think Paige might be right,” I said finally. Riley glanced at me. “About the promotion thing?” “Yeah.” She smiled, not surprised. “I told you.” I huffed softly. “You always do.” “That is because you always forget,” she said, nudging my knee lightly with hers. I thought about the internal posting. The bookmark. The way it had felt to speak up in that meeting without rehearsing it in my head first. “I didn’t apply,” I said. “I know.” I looked at her. “How?” “You would have told me if you did,” she said. “Or you would be panicking right now.”



That was true.



The bus slowed at our stop. “But,” Riley added as we stood, “you are thinking about it. And that counts.” I nodded. It did.



Paige lived in a small duplex not far from work, the kind of place that always smelled faintly like whatever she had cooked last. When Riley and I arrived, the lights were already on and the door was unlocked. “Shoes off,” Paige called from the kitchen before we even announced ourselves. Caleb was already there, sitting at the table with a drink in his hand, sleeves rolled up like he had been helping with something. Julian leaned against the counter nearby, watching Paige move around the kitchen like he was cataloging it.



“You’re late,” Paige said, but she smiled when she said it. “We took the scenic route,” Riley replied. “There is no scenic route,” Paige said. “Exactly.”



We settled in the way we always did. Someone claimed the couch. Someone else grabbed an extra chair from the corner. Plates were passed around without asking. Conversation overlapped and doubled back on itself. At some point, Caleb handed me a drink I hadn’t asked for. “Figured,” he said with a shrug, a warm smile and a slight wink. “Thanks.” Julian asked a question that turned into a debate. Paige disappeared and came back with more food. Riley kicked her feet up onto the coffee table like she owned the place.



I sat there and let it happen.



At one point, Paige looked around the room and sighed, content. “I like this,” she said. “We should keep doing this even when work gets stupid.” “When?” Riley echoed. “Work is already stupid.” “True,” Paige conceded. I laughed, and it surprised me how easy it felt.



Later, when the night wound down and people started checking the time, I helped Paige stack plates in the sink. “You okay?” she asked quietly. “Yeah,” I said. “I think I am.” She nodded like that answer made sense.



Walking home later, the air felt cooler. Lighter. I didn’t know what the next step was yet. But for the first time, it felt like I didn’t have to take it alone.



Saturday passed more slowly than I expected. I cleaned my apartment in pieces, starting and stopping whenever something else caught my attention. Laundry sat folded on the couch longer than it needed to. Dishes dried in the rack while I stood there, staring at them without really seeing them.



At some point in the afternoon, I opened my laptop. I didn’t mean to look for anything specific. I just did. The internal posting was still bookmarked.



I hovered over it for a second before clicking.



It looked the same as it had on Friday. Same title. Same careful language. Same list of responsibilities that felt uncomfortably familiar.



**Position: Operations Support Coordinator**

**Division: Internal Systems and Continuity**

**Posting Type: Internal Expansion**



The description was short. Careful. Almost intentionally plain.



**^(“Provide operational support across multiple departments during periods of transition. Maintain documentation and process consistency to reduce workflow disruption. Assist in identifying gaps, redundancies, and unresolved escalations. Act as a liaison between teams when responsibilities overlap or stall.”)**



There wasn’t anything flashy about it. No promises. No urgency. Just quiet expectations. The qualifications were worse.



**^(“Demonstrates reliability and follow through. Strong written communication and organizational awareness. Ability to work independently with minimal oversight. Comfort operating in evolving or undefined structures.”)**



I read that last line twice.



I had been doing most of this already. Not officially. Not because anyone had asked. Just because things tended to fall apart if no one stepped in. At the bottom of the posting, separated by a thin gray line, was a final note.



*^(Qualified candidates may be identified internally based on observed performance and organizational need.)*



I imagined what it would be like to do that work officially instead of incidentally. To have it recognized. To stop feeling like I was quietly proving myself to people who didn’t know they were watching.



I opened a blank document. Just in case. I typed my name at the top.



*“Nicole Bennett.”*



I stared at it for what felt like hours, until a dog outside barked and snapped me back. I closed the document.



On Sunday, I tried again. This time I told myself I was just practicing. That there was no pressure. That no one would see it unless I wanted them to. I sat at my kitchen table with a mug of reheated coffee and pulled the posting up again. I reread the qualifications, nodding along like I was agreeing with something obvious.



I started drafting a message. Nothing formal. Just a note.



*“Interest expressed. Experience mentioned. Confidence implied.”*



I deleted the first sentence. Then the second. I wrote a third version that sounded too apologetic and erased that one too.



By the time the light outside shifted and the room dimmed, I had rewritten the same paragraph six times. Each version felt wrong in a different way. Too eager. Too cautious. Too confident. Not confident enough. I closed my laptop and walked away from it.



Later that night, curled up on the couch with a blanket pulled over my knees, I opened it again. One last try.



I reread what I had written and imagined hitting send. I imagined the waiting. The wondering. The second guessing every word. I imagined the email being opened by someone who already had a name in mind. My chest tightened. I highlighted the text. Deleted it. Then I closed the posting. Unbookmarked it. I told myself I would think about it again later. Sunday nights are good at that. Convincing you there is always more time. I went to bed telling myself it was fine. That I hadn’t missed anything yet. Monday morning came faster than I expected.



The alarm went off at 6:30, and this time I didn’t hit snooze. I lay there for a few seconds anyway, staring at the ceiling, tracing the familiar crack without really seeing it. My chest felt tight. Not anxious, exactly. Just alert. Like something had already started moving without asking me. I got up and moved through the routine on autopilot. Cold floor. Coffee maker. Same chipped mug. Everything where it was supposed to be. The coffee tasted the same as always.



On the bus, Riley sat beside me, scrolling through her phone with one earbud half in, the way she did when she was open to conversation but not demanding it. The city slid past the windows in a blur of corners and storefronts I could have named without thinking. “You’re quiet,” she said after a while. “I’m fine,” I said. And I meant it. Mostly. She nodded, satisfied, and turned back to her screen. I didn’t open my laptop. I didn’t think about the posting. I told myself that whatever I had felt over the weekend had settled. That I had done the responsible thing by not rushing into something I wasn’t ready for. By the time we got off the bus and walked the last block, the thought felt convincing enough to believe.



The parking lot was already half full. Julian stood near the edge like he always did, hands in his pockets, watching the building with that distant focus of his. Paige was talking animatedly about something that had happened over the weekend, using her hands like punctuation. Caleb leaned against his car, coffee in hand, listening more than he spoke. “Morning,” Riley said as we approached. “Morning,” Paige echoed. “You look awake today.” “Do I?” I asked. She smiled. “More than usual.” I reached into my pocket to check the time. That was when my phone buzzed.



Just once.



I almost ignored it. I expected a calendar reminder. A payment notification. Something automated and impersonal.Instead, I saw an email preview from an internal address I didn’t recognize. The subject line was careful. Neutral.



**Opportunity for Discussion.**



I stopped walking. Riley noticed immediately. “Hey. What’s up?” “I” I started, then stopped. Paige turned toward me, mid sentence. “What is it?” “I think,” I said slowly, looking down at my phone again, “I just got an email I wasn’t expecting.” Julian tilted his head slightly, attention sharpening. Caleb glanced over, then back at my face. “Is that good?” “I don’t know,” I said honestly. The email sat there, unopened. Waiting.



For a second, I thought about Sunday night. About the draft I had deleted. About unbookmarking the posting. About how certain I had felt that I still had time. My thumb hovered over the screen. Then I took a breath. And opened it. The email didn’t load. I tapped it once. Then again. The preview stayed stubbornly vague, replaced by a short line beneath the subject.



**This message must be accessed from a secure workstation.**



I stared at it longer than I should have. Riley leaned in slightly. “What does it say?” “It doesn’t,” I said. “It just won’t open.” Paige frowned. “Like a system error?” “I don’t know,” I said. My mouth felt dry. “It says I have to open it from a secure workstation.” Julian’s brow furrowed. “That’s not that weird. Some internal messages are locked like that.” That didn’t help. Caleb tilted his head, studying my face. “You didn’t apply for anything, did you?” “No,” I said immediately. Too quickly. “I didn’t send anything.”Riley looked at me. “Are you sure?” “Yes,” I said. Then, softer, “I’m sure.”



Because I was.

I remembered it clearly. Closing the document. Deleting the draft. Unbookmarking the posting. I hadn’t typed anything except my name. My name. A tight, unwelcome thought slid in anyway.

Heya guys,
I (f31) have a 3rd date with a guy (m37) next week.
We went for drinks in our first date and was really fun, 2nd date was a walk and coffee.

Now issue is we both live at home with our parents, for me it was rent is way to expensive and him bridging the gap between renting and buying his own house.

So we we don't have many things we can do with ""privacy"". Not necessarily ""that"" type of privacy but just something that's easy and quiet and not totally revolving around alcohol. 

He suggested the last 2 dates so I would like to have an idea this time.

Anyone have any ideas ",1,1766709560.0,Advice,6,1.0,False

They all put the cash in their pockets. They don’t think I saw it but when I went to sit down they were speaking to the headset looking at me drinking my coffee in the cafe. They were extremely polite to me all day. 

I didn’t say anything because it’s Christmas and I didn’t want to start the day with drama, but they stole money from everyone who signed up to work on Christmas. Especially when we sign up to work on Christmas BECAUSE of the tips. It’s eating me inside that I didn’t say anything and that I was alone with the SSV in the back right after that happens and I didn’t bring it  up. 

Is really not about the money because I’m sure my tips would increase about $1 or $2 max, but is the principle of it all.

1pvqzv0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pvqzv0,"The most amazing gift I've received in quite some time - thank you, Secret Santa","I am beyond overwhelmed.

I haven't really been much of a Christmas person for a while. Not into the holidays at all, truth be told. Through November and December, I actually struggle even harder with my depression. For me, it's a time of seclusion, loneliness, and sadness. So why I signed up for a Secret Santa gift exchange (TWO, no less) is beyond my comprehension.

But today, I believe I was shown why.

My Secret Santa reached out to me for some clarification on my questionnaire. And I feel I was fairly thorough on my answers, but they wanted to hone in on what it was I was looking for. And boy, did they.

For starters, they included an incredibly sweet hand-written letter to explain their choices. And not only that, but they even specified what inks they used. Which now has me looking to buy at least 2 or 3 of the inks they used.

Additionally, they sent me a LOT of different ink samples. All nicely labeled. So many different inks that I am extremely looking forward to trying out. I already started with one of them and love how great it looks and definitely how much it matches the pen they sent me. But I'm getting ahead of myself.

They also sent me FIVE journals. And not just any standard-issue journals. Two of them were specifically chosen to match a particular style I described. I had said that I'm more a fan of the standard-sized journals but that I also really liked the look of the grail diary from ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"". They sent me an awesome pocket-sized Leuchtturm journal. A gorgeous red color and with dot grid pages. I never even mentioned to them that I had been highly interested in trying out dot grid paper.

Then there is the medium-sized journal. A beautiful brown leather book that has made me desperately want to finish my current journal so that I can put this one into play next. Again, very much in line with my IJ style.

And then I looked at the other three journals.

They all have prompts to help motivate and inspire you on every page. And not just to write, but to also better yourself. The first two have a very cheeky title on the cover. Cute, funny...made me chuckle at their words. But the third...

It's titled ""Gratitude Journal - 5 Minutes a Day Toward Creating a Meaningful Life of Joy and Connection"". The beautiful artwork and colors of the cover already had me smiling. But when I opened the book and read the introduction...

You can see it in the photos, so I won't retype it here. But it instantly had the tears flowing. It felt so spot-on. Like they could read beyond what I told them and knew just what I needed. Each page has a different prompt to guide you into writing an entry. And I vowed to them that I will utilize this journal every day until it is filled. I already made today's entry. I very much can't wait to do tomorrow's.

But of course, my Secret Santa didn't stop there. They also sent me a pen. An IMMACULATE, BEAUTIFUL pen. The design is ""cherry blossoms"".

First of all, they stuck to my desire for the more classic pen builds. I specifically said I like the cigar-shapped or slim styling. That I wasn't necessarily a fan of the more ""modern"" looking pens like the Safaris or Benus. But I also told them that my color preferences are more simplistic. That I'm not a fan of overly showy designs or patterns. Colors tend toward the darker blacks and reds...that sort of thing. What they sent me just absolutely amazed me.

The body is my exact style. It's a piston filler (which I love, and is also my first piston). But beyond that, there's the aesthetic. It's a fairly pink-colored pen. And though I'm not opposed to pink (one of my favorite shirts is kind of a salmon-collored pink), it's not something I feel I would have ever bought for myself. However, the design is based on the Japanese cherry blossoms. And HOLY HELL if that doesn't just hit home for me.

I love this pen. It's gorgeous. It writes amazingly. It feels great in my hand. I actually used this pen and the Cheshire Cat ink sample they sent me to write my first entry in the Gratitude journal.

Oh...one last note. They also asked me if I was a tea or coffee person. To which I said that I was definitely more of a tea drinker. And they sent me a sample pack of 4 different local teas. Because of them, this is the first day off in...I don't even know how long that I have drank anything other than whiskey throughout the day. The Canton Spice Tea was delicious, and I cannot wait to try the others. Black Raven is next on my list.

To my Secret Santa - thank you. I have not felt this moved during this time of year for...well over five years. I feel motivated. Inspired. But more than anything...I feel cared for.

You truly made Christmas come alive again for me. Made me feel happiness. Gave me a desire to try. 

Thank you for bringing joy back into my life.",8,1766709174.0,fountainpens,2,1.0,False

Her pee was so pungent. I kept telling her to get up and I would help her to the bathroom. she kept snapping at me.

Her doctor has told her for many years that she NEEDS TO WORKOUT. In one ear and out the other. I have told her the same over and over.

She does not listen to me at all. She will argue and scream at me. I have bought her tons of exercise equipment and I've spent tons of money between a sitting elliptical, a treadmill, a recumbent bike, small dumbbells and so on

She continues to not do anything to maintain her health. She will sit all day — drinking diet coke, coffee and smoking cigarettes.

Now she has absolutely no muscle and she continues to experience muscle atrophy. I had to call 911 and thankfully I threw her hoards on the other side of her bed.

Last year she was admitted to the hospital twice. Now again tonight. I am so frustrated, overwhelmed and exhausted. I have colon cancer and I'm doing the best I can, but the amount of stress that I am dealing with between her and everything make me depressed.

I’m holding on in hopes that she will go to Japan and never come back.

I need a little peace. Her issues can be helped if she would get off her ass and do what her doctor says. She puts too many expectations on others to help her do everything. When her husband was alive he crippled her by doing everything for her.

She barely speaks enough English to survive. She has made me hate the holidays, because every holiday this is what I have to look forward to, cleaning up after her and going to the hospital to sit for 18+ hours in the emergency room.",16,1766708823.0,CaregiverSupport,3,0.94,False

1pvquk3,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1pvquk3/stuck_in_my_mind/,Stuck in my mind,"Hi reddit,
I'm new to this sub, so I don't exactly know how this works but I wanted somewhere to get this off my chest :))

So about 3 years ago someone admitted their feelings for me, just before a trip we planned together (everyone else in our friend group jumped off just before that). I came freshly from a couple year long relationship and was still heartbroken. So I kind of didn't know how to handle everything and was probably too attaching, which led them to quickly distance themselves, already during the trip. We did manage to end the trip on good terms and met up a couple times, but it was still me seeking after them. It then pretty much ended one day, when I realised that I didn't want to wait for something that wasn't supposed to be.
They messaged me a few months later asking for some advice regarding the things I do for work and then about a year later when I asked if they wanted to go grab a coffee and catch up they said they didn't have the capacity at that time.
Since then I got in a relationship which I'm quite happy in and I know they date/dated someone at some point at least. Still, they have been stuck in my head a lot ever since. There's up and downs and I really know there is no connecting between us. I believe it's really not them I think about, but that time of my life, where even with the emotional rollercoaster, I did have some excitement. I did kind of idol them for a long time as well, they were super smart (also in uni) and athletic. Now I super content with myself and love my partner and would never change anything about that. I really just don't know why they were stuck in my head for so long.
So couple months ago I came by their social media again (I think they deactivated their old account which we were mutuals on and made a new one which I don't follow and don't plan to). But I saw a couple pictures of them and they went super downhill. I don't want to describe those changes, I don't mean it in any derogatory way, but it just clicked in my head and I completely lost the image I had of them. I don't think I had ever not thought about them for as long as I just did since I saw how they look now. So earlier today (because it's christmas and I was looking for some family photos on my phone) I came by some vacation pictures from our trip together and that's how I remembered.
Now writing all this down makes me feel a bit stupid, but I wanted to get it off my chest, so here we are.

1pvqtdh,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1pvqtdh/the_naughty_list/,The Naughty List,"**I was 10 years old when I realized everything I knew about Santa Claus was wrong.**

Before that, Christmas was something I tried not to hope for too much. My mom worked long hours, sometimes two jobs at once, and came home smelling like bleach and coffee grounds. She always decorated the apartment anyway. A crooked tree from the discount lot. Lights that flickered if you breathed on them too hard.

The presents had been getting smaller every year. Socks. A paperback book. One year, a toothbrush wrapped like it was a joke. My mom always apologized, her eyes shiny, saying things would get better.

I told her it was okay. But I knew why it was happening.

Santa had decided I was not good enough.

That changed when Travis Murchison told me the truth behind the bike racks after school.

“Santa is not real the way they say,” he whispered. “He is the devil.”

I laughed at first. Travis liked scaring people. But he leaned closer. “Think about it. Bad kids always get the best stuff. My cousin lit a mailbox on fire and got a dirt bike that year. Nice kids get skipped. Why would the devil reward goodness.”

I did not sleep much that night. I kept replaying the last few Christmases. Every time I tried to be polite. Every time I helped my mom without complaining. All that goodness had earned me nothing.

If Santa rewarded bad kids, then I had made a mistake. So I started fixing it.

I stole candy from the corner store. I pushed a kid down the stairs at school and told the teacher he slipped. I broke a neighbor’s window and blamed it on older kids.

My mom noticed. Of course she did.

She grounded me. She cried. One night she grabbed my shoulders and said, “Please tell me what is wrong. I do not recognize you anymore.”

I almost told her. But Christmas was too close.

On Christmas Eve, she fell asleep on the couch still wearing her work uniform. I lay in bed listening to the building creak. Around midnight, something heavy moved on the roof. Not footsteps exactly. More like dragging weight.

Then the living room glowed red. Red like something alive.

I crept into the hallway.

A figure stood by the tree. Tall. Bent. Wrapped in dark fur that looked burned instead of dyed. The air smelled like smoke and cold metal. I saw horns curling beneath its hood.

It dropped a sack at the base of the tree. The sound was wet.

I shut my eyes. When I opened them again, the room was dark.

In the morning, the presents were real. A game system. New clothes. Toys I had only seen in commercials.

My mom sobbed. She told me she had been working nights for months, hiding the money, saving every dollar so I would not feel forgotten.

I hugged her. I told her she was the best mom in the world.

I never told her what I saw.

Now that I am older, I know better. There is no Santa Claus. There is no devil sneaking down chimneys. There is only each one of us, choosing day by day who we are going to be.

Still, on certain winter nights, when the wind scrapes the shingles, I wonder who I saw that night in the living room, and if he is ever coming back.",7,1766708634.0,shortscarystories,0,0.89,False

Chapter 1


On the anniversary of my son's death, my half-sister Lily had one of her ""manic episodes.""
To calm her down, my husband Nathaniel ignored me as I knelt on the floor, kowtowing ninety-nine times, begging him to stop her from smashing the urn holding my son's ashes—my child who'd been dead for a year.
The sound was sharp and piercing. Ash scattered across the floor like gray snow.
I stared at the wreckage, feeling as if something had been hollowed out from inside me, leaving nothing but an empty shell.
Yet he turned on me instead. ""He's already dead. Why do you have to keep his ashes in the house and torture her like this? Are you really trying to drive her to suicide?""
But he'd forgotten—it was Lily's fault our child died in the first place.
I gazed at the ruins on the floor, my heart so numb with pain I couldn't feel it anymore.
That night, I didn't cry. I didn't beg.
I simply cleaned the floor until it was spotless. Then I did three things.
From that day forward, Nathaniel and I would be strangers, no matter how far the world stretched between us.
...
...
Clutching the newly purchased urn, I returned home alone.
But standing before that familiar manor, a maid stepped forward to block my path.
""Mrs. Hayes... I'm sorry, but I can't let you in.""
My grip tightened on the paper bag. ""What?""
The maid kept her head down, as if reciting an order:
""Mr. Nathaniel instructed that from today on, anything that might destabilize... Miss Lily's emotional state must first be reviewed by him.""
She glanced up at me, her eyes a mixture of discomfort and pity.
I suddenly understood.
A few hours ago, when Lily smashed my son's urn, Nathaniel said she was just ""sick.""
Now, I'd merely gone out to buy a replacement urn, and I'd become a threat that needed to be screened.
Maybe he'd forgotten.
Two years ago, I'd severed ties with my parents for him. He'd used the last of my trust fund to buy this house.
Back then, he'd held my hand and said: ""Aurora, this will be your safest harbor.""
And now, he'd personally shut me out.
""I'm the mistress of this house,"" I said, keeping my anger in check.
But the maid's hand remained blocking the doorframe.
""I know, but... the master said it's for Miss Lily's health.""
Health.
It was almost laughable how ironic it was.
Just as I was about to speak again, the sound of slippers echoed from inside the house.
""What's going on?""
Lily appeared in the doorway.
Her blonde curls were soft and tousled, a bathrobe draped over her frame, her cheeks flushed from warmth—
As if she'd just emerged from a fragrant bath, enjoying a peaceful, luxurious evening.
There was no trace of the breakdown and screaming hysteria from just hours ago.
When she saw me, surprise flickered across her face, quickly replaced by a gentle, proper smile:
""Aurora, you're back? Why are you standing outside? Come in.""
Her tone was so natural, so intimate, as if I were a guest who'd been away too long.
The maid's body went rigid. ""Miss Lily, Mr. Nathaniel said—""
""It's fine,"" Lily interrupted with a laugh, her bearing already that of the lady of the house.
""Nathaniel's just being cautious because he's worried I'll get... emotional again. Don't make things difficult for Aurora.""
""Lily?"" Nathaniel's voice came from the direction of the stairs.
""Why are you out here again? The floor's cold.""
Lily dropped her head like a cat caught misbehaving. ""I heard a noise... I thought Aurora was upset...""
She even gave a little shrug of her shoulders.
Only then did Nathaniel notice me, his expression turning stormy. ""Why did you buy that thing again? Isn't Lily already agitated enough?""
I clutched the paper bag and took a deep breath.
""If I don't buy a new urn, how am I supposed to hold our child's ashes? Did you want our son to stay in that broken container forever?!""
I glanced toward the corner at the cheap plastic candy jar—
If not for Lily's outburst, my child wouldn't have been reduced to huddling in that makeshift, undignified container.
""Enough, Aurora!""
Nathaniel's voice was ice-cold. ""What's done is done! It's just an urn—if it's broken, it's broken. Why do you have to keep bringing this up? Are you trying to push Lily to a breakdown? To suicide?""
Lily's shoulders began to tremble.
Nathaniel took a deep breath, as if forcing himself to control his emotions:
""Now, apologize to Lily. For what's in your hands, and for your relentless harassment.""
I froze.
He knew—he knew—
A year ago today, it was Lily who drove drunk.
It was Lily who hit me when I was eight months pregnant, who murdered Tom's heartbeat with her own hands.
Afterward, she not only escaped justice by claiming ""illness,"" but convinced Nathaniel it was all just an accident.
Today, she'd used another ""episode"" as an excuse to destroy Tom's ashes.
And now, they wanted me to apologize to this murderer.
Hearing his command, Lily's eyes reddened right on cue:
""Aurora, I'm sorry... when this illness takes over, I can't control myself... I feel worse than you do about it. If I could, I'd rather have died instead of Tom...""
Nathaniel squeezed her shoulder with tender concern. ""Don't be afraid. It's over. I'm here.""
I couldn't help but laugh.
The sound hurt my chest.
I lowered my head to look at the paper bag in my arms.
Inside was Tom's ""new home.""
But the home that was supposed to be mine—
There was no space left for me in it.
""Enough.""
I walked past them, heading straight to my room, ready to do three things I'd wanted to do for a long time.
The first thing.
I pulled out my phone and made an international call.
""Dr. Gabriel, I accept your offer to join the AMP research team.""
There was surprise on the other end. ""Really? That's wonderful. Our team really needs someone with your capabilities.""
""However, this research position requires strict confidentiality. Once you join, your family won't be able to contact you. Do they approve?""
My eyes dimmed, and I spoke hoarsely: ""I'll handle it.""
There really wasn't much to handle.
After a moment of silence, he didn't press further, simply saying:
""Alright, I'll process the paperwork. Report for duty in seven days.""

Chapter 2


Seven days later—
It was both my wedding anniversary with Nathaniel.
And the day he planned to throw me a grand makeup wedding ceremony.
Perfect. On that day, I'd give him a gift he'd never forget.
That night, Nathaniel didn't return to our bedroom.
I didn't even need to guess where he'd gone, or who he was with.
What I didn't expect was that the next morning, when I came downstairs—
He was already waiting there.
Nathaniel sat alone on the sofa. When he saw me, his furrowed brow relaxed slightly, and he gestured toward the coffee table—
An exquisite ebony box.
The lid was carved with intricate lily patterns, the design I'd once chosen for Tom.
""Aurora,"" his tone softened, as if soothing an emotionally fragile child.
""I was too impulsive last night. I shouldn't have lost my temper with you.""
He pushed the box forward.
""I searched the entire city to find this. The craftsman said this was the closest replica he could make to the original... I thought Tom would like it.""
He paused. ""Let the past be the past. It's just a box. We still have a long future ahead of us.""
Just a box?
Even now, he stubbornly believed our problems were merely about a box—
As if buying a more expensive one could completely cover up Lily's violence and his callousness.
This wasn't compensation. It was a transaction.
He wanted to trade this expensive urn for my compliance, for the wedding that had to maintain appearances.
I remained silent, but he took it as moved acceptance.
He stood up, feigning casualness.
""You know Lily's mental state has always been unstable.""
""The doctor said she needs some 'sense of achievement' to stabilize her emotions."" Nathaniel's voice was as calm as if discussing the weather. ""Next month in Geneva, there's the 'Young Scientist of the Year Award.' Drop out and nominate her instead.""
My breath caught as if seized by something invisible.
That was five years of my work.
My algorithm, my experiments, my seventeen drafts revised until deep into the night.
And Lily—she'd appeared in the lab exactly once, crying that the pressure was too much, before I sent her home to rest.
""Are you... serious?"" My voice was tight.
Nathaniel looked at me like he was trying to reason with a tantruming child:
""It doesn't matter to you, Aurora. But Lily's different. She needs to prove herself to cure her illness.""
He paused, his voice dropping lower:
""You're not going to refuse her even this, are you?""
Those words were like a sharp blade against my throat.
""This is my honor! Why should I give it to her?"" A rush of blood surged to my head.
""Because I can make that award meaningless.""
Nathaniel stepped forward, his shadow looming over me.
""Just as I was able to upgrade your lab equipment overnight, I can have your key collaborators announce your data is unreliable by tomorrow. Think about your team, Aurora. Think about those doctoral students who've stayed up late with you, their graduations, their futures...""
My nails dug into my palms, the pain sharp and sobering.
Of course.
This was the truth behind his ""generous"" investment all along.
That top-tier equipment, those crucial introductions—none of it was recognition of my ability. It was all groundwork laid for this very moment.
Early on, he'd used what I treasured most—my career—to build a gilded cage I could never escape.
I remembered so many sleepless nights after signing that sponsorship agreement.
I'd thought that weighty document represented a man's deepest support and trust in his wife's dreams.
How naïve I'd been.
But I couldn't refuse.
Not just for myself.
I saw the young, focused faces in my lab. Their futures were tied inextricably to my name.
I looked at the man before me. This scene was eerily similar to when—
More than a year ago, when he'd covered up Lily's drunk driving with the exact same tone.
And all of this was for Lily.
""...Fine. I'll withdraw. I'll... recommend her.""
There was no surprise on Nathaniel's face. He straightened his cuffs.
""That's my good girl.""
He turned to leave, tossing one last remark into the air:
""Get some rest. Tomorrow Lily and I need to pick out a special outfit for her speech.""
I watched his figure disappear down the hall, numb.
Then, without hesitation, I turned and left to do the second thing I'd been wanting to do.

Bit of a long shot, but thought I’d ask here rather than LinkedIn.

I’m Edinburgh-based, moved here for university and live with my GF, been working full time as a project engineer.  My background is in mechanical engineering and I've worked for over a year in my role.  I've been taking more of an interest in Google appscript and JS and I've developed a few systems at work for manual approvals and follow-ups, permit-to-work workflows, site access & induction management, inventory tracking, structured data collection (forms with logic, validation, mapping, timestamps), automated emails and notifications, custom document generation (PDFs, branded outputs).  The plan is to work with some small/medium sized businesses to help implement these kinds of solutions.
 
To be upfront: this isn’t a paid role. At this stage it would be shared equity in a small side venture, evenings/weekends, and seeing if there’s a good fit before anything formal. Very much exploratory rather than high-pressure.

If you’re curious about small business, automation, process improvement, or just want to explore a sensible side project with another human rather than solo grinding, feel free to drop me a message.

Happy to grab a coffee (pint is preferred) and chat it through.

Cheers🙌 ",0,1766708487.0,Edinburgh,1,0.5,False

1pvqp20,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1pvqp20/the_blue/,The Blue,"Once upon a time, there were two people driving down a wooded area during midday. John was the man driving the car, with his girlfriend Jessica in the passenger seat with him. They have heard about these strange woods and the tales of disappearances that have happened to people who walked the north trail.

John works as the grill man at the local Henry’s Burger joint. All day and evening he would flip burgers and put more on the grill, over and over in an endless cycle. Of course, this life was rather mundane, but at least he had some interesting coworkers to keep him company there. Like Luke for example. He had a strange habit of screaming ‘Peanut Butter Jelly Time’ whenever the clock hit 8:00PM. The reason why is that there was no reason at all. Then there was grumpy Joe. He was 50 years old, and still working the fryers at the fast food joint. Not that John was much better, he is already 30 and still works the grill. Guess sometimes life can be sad sometimes, but at least he was not homeless, and on top of that, he also has his beautiful girlfriend he looks forward to seeing after work. That seems to dull the pain at least a bit. Oh, and he does enjoy his gaming time at his house, and his time smoking weed with Luke and George.

Then there is Jessica. She is a slender short woman with brown shoulder length hair with deep brown eyes. She often wears her short jean shorts with a black tank top and blue sweater tied around her waist. Jessica is a fan of the paranormal. She’s into all of it. Ghosts, cryptids, aliens, demons, chakra, ouija boards, crystals, terrocards, you name it, she’s into it. She’s, of course, a big fan of horror movies too, such as Steven King’s *It* and *The Howling* . About a week prior, Jessica got wind of this forest and heard from one of her Starbucks friends that there was a northern path in the woods of Termoia that many hikers have disappeared in. No bodies were ever found. No foot prints, clothes, or anything of that nature. They went on the path, and were just gone with no trace.

John and Jessica finally arrived. It was the northern path. Both Jessica and John took out their cameras and voice recording equipment. Looking around, John thought to himself, “Man, this is the place everyone disappeared in? It looks so…so normal.” Jessica was also looking around, and she did not seem all that impressed with the lack of spooky vibes either. They then began to walk down the path. To John, nothing seemed all that off. There was no feeling of being watched, nor was there any weight in his stomach. There was no racing heard, increased alertness, or that feeling of tightness in the throat. All was, what looked to be, normal. In fact, the walk was rather peaceful and refreshing. John could hear the birds chirping in the tree like a comforting symphony of nature. He could hear the shallow river babbling down the bed of stones underneath it. Even the smell was pleasant.

After about fifteen minutes, Jessica stopped. She then walked over to a spot just outside the path they were walking. She said to John, “Come over here. There’s this weird thing just sitting on the ground.” John thought to himself, “Did she find a strange rock again?” He then proceeded to follow Jessica to the spot she was at. Then John saw it. It was a plain blue cube, just sitting there on the forest ground. John looked at it with wonder. It looked so…so perfect. No blemishes. No deformities. No spots. It was simple, yet so perfect. John looked at it with wonder. He then reached for it. Jessica then interrupted and said, “What are you doing? We don’t have any idea what that thing is. You could…you could get like set on fire or turn into a mouse if you touch it.” John replied, “It’s…just one moment. That’s all. Holding once can’t hurt anything.” John then picked up the cube. When he did this, he held it in his hands. John could see the cube looked precious to him. Then something happened. The cube just faded from his hands, almost as if it was but an illusion. Like a projection on a screen. Just like that, the cube was gone.

After the cube disappeared, John looked to Jessica. She was staring at him with a blank stare. John gave her a weird look, and she said, “You done?” John replied, “Uh, yeah.” Jessica then said, “We must move forward to complete our walk.” John said, “Okay then.” He then walked with Jessica the rest of the way down the trail. Everything was fine, though not as lively now. John stopped smelling the flowers and grass, and the birds sang in a strange rhythm. It almost sounded robotic and was repeating over and over the exact same series of chirps. John thought it a bit strange, but he shrugged and continued on his walk with his girlfriend. About a half an hour later, they exited the same way that entered the trail. Jessica and John then got back into the car, but this time Jessica was the one driving them back home. Throughout the entire time, it seemed weirdly calm and normal, almost too normal.

After arriving back home, the two of them sat on the couch and watched a movie. John let Jessica pick the movie this time. John said, “Honey, you can pick the movie tonight since you drove us here.” Jessica replied, “No. I think you should decide. After all, you are the one to pick up the cube.” John said, “Um, are you sure? I thought you would jump on the opportunity to pick out one of your demon and ghost movies.” Jessica replied, “Honey, you can pick the movie tonight since you picked up the cube.” The voice Jessica used was the exact same, weirdly monotone voice she used before. John looked at her. He thought to himself, “Why does she sound the same? Is she alright? Maybe she was spooked in the forest? But there was nothing there. Everything was peaceful. Nothing was usual, except for that cube, but that disappeared as soon as I picked it up. Why is she acting like this?” Jessica then interrupted, “You have a movie you have selected for us to view?” John said, “Uh, yeah. We can watch…uh…Strar Trek the motion picture.” Jessica replied, “Works for me.” John looked a little surprised. He then said, “But you think that movie is boring?” Jessica then repeated in the exact same voice, “Works for me.” John stared at her for a minute. She stared right back with her blue eyes. John then moved his eyes away from hers. He then picked up the movie and put it in the DVD player. The movie started to play. They watched a long panning of the USS Enterprise with its slightly light blue color. The movie continued, and the plot progressed. It was not the same plot that John remembered. Everything seemed to turn more…more generic. The plot became more plot, and the color on the Enterprise looked to be getting slowly more and more blue over time. As the movie got closer and closer to its end, John got a pit in his stomach. Heat began to creep up his throat, and his heart began to pound faster and faster. John did not know why. Nothing strange was happening in the movie. It was just normal, like a generic science fiction movie. Why was he feeling like this? Where was this fear coming from? John did not know. The movie then ended with the end credits fading to blue. Wanting to get his mind off the movie, John decided to go to bed.

The next day, John got into his blue car to drive to work. As he drove down the road, he noticed that all the other cars on the road were blue. Different shades, some being navy blue or baby blue, but all of them were nonetheless blue. John then arrived at the burger joint. He walked into the back to go to the grill. He then noticed something odd. All of the knobs on the grill were blue. John thought to himself, “Blue? I…I thought they were red. How…how are they…well maybe they had to replace the knobs or something. But everything else looks the same. Well maybe I’m just remembering wrong. Yeah…that must be it. I’m just losing the sharpness of my memory. I am getting a little older after all. Just hit 35. That’s when my memory would start to glitch a bit. Yeah, nothing more.” John then started to work the grill. He then looked at the spatulas he was using. He then noticed this, and his heart beat faster. The handles for the spatulas were blue. Now this can not be a simple lapse of memory. John knew very well that these handles were not supposed to be blue. John thought, “How…how is this possible. I know…I know this isn’t right. They…they are supposed to be red and black. Red for raw meat and black for cooked. How…how are they blue.” He then spun the spatula around and thought, “It’s…it’s the same. It’s got…the same little gouge at the top right. It’s our spatula, but why…why is it blue?” Then the middle man Eric said, “You have those burgers ready.” John snapped out of it and said, “Yeah, coming.” Eric then repeated in the same voice as before, “You have those burgers ready?” John, now a little irritated, said, “Yes yes they’re coming. Just give me a second.” John soon put the burgers on the bun like John asked. After about two hours, John’s eyes wandered to the uniforms. He then noticed something odd. All of the other workers were wearing blue ties and blue shoes. John was perplexed by this, and a little simmering dread began to build within his stomach. He did not know why, but something seemed very very off. John said to Eric, “Since when did we get blue ties?” Eric replied, “We have always had blue ties. It’s our brand. Blue tie, blue shoes, blue everything.” John replied, “Blue everything? Wait, we haven’t had blue ties before. What are you talking about?” Eric replied with the same exact voice, “We have always…” John  then interrupted with a sharp aggressive voice. He said with a crack of irritation and a lacing of worry, “You already said that. Stop repeating yourself. Come on now. Give me a real answer. Since when did we get those stupid blue ties?” Eric did not reply. John then turned and huffed. He then finished his shift on the grill like a robot placing parts on an industrial belt in a factory.

John then drove home after work. On his way home, he noticed that all of the stop signs turned blue, though John was too tired and burned out to care. He then slowly walked into the door. The room was the same as before, except for the vases being blue. This was too small of a detail for John to really notice or care about. At least John could get his mind off of this blue nonsense with some nice za za. John invited his coworkers for his weekly ritual of snacks, cartoons, and pot. It was himself, Joe, and Luke. Joe walked in without his weekly sigh, and Luke never screamed his ""Peanut Butter Jelly Time” John pulled out the blunts and brought out a lighter. They all then lit up and smoked. John then noticed something else that put his stomach in a knot. All of the smoke from the weed came out the same. It was the same swirls and rings without any difference from the previous puff. He then noticed that the end of the roll was not red with burning leaves, but was a bright blue. John, feeling rather startled by this, then took a step back. He said, “Why…why is this…why is your end blue?” Both Joe and Luke then said in a monotone voice, “The end burns blue.” John then yelled, “What the hell does that mean? The end burns blue?” Both Joe and Luke just repeated what they said before, in the exact same monotone voice. John took a step back. His heart then began to race. He knew something was horribly horribly off. He thought, “This…this doesn’t just…happen. Everything's been so weird since that trip. What is going on? I can’t make a scene.” He then said to his friends, “I…gotta to get to bed. I had a long day. I’ll see you in the morning at work.” John then walked to his bedroom to lay in his bed with blue sheets and pillows.

The next day, John got up, drank his morning coffee, and headed to work. On his drive to work, he noticed not only were all of the stop signs now blue, but all of the signs and lights were now blue. All of the paint on the buildings was blue. Every car was blue, from the smallest of fuel efficient cars to the largest of trucks. They were all blue. He drove on, ready to work, though this blue created a deep sense of unease with him.  When he entered the restaurant, he noticed that all of the customers were eating in a strange robotic way. They looked as if they were animatronics at an amusement park more than they looked like human patrons, and all of their clothing was some shade of blue. John then entered the back. Not only were their ties all blue, but their entire uniform was blue. John then said to Joe, “Why is everyone wearing blue?” Joe replied, “We are all blue here.” John’s heart then raced with terror. All of the color drained from his head. His face looked pale as fresh fallen snow in November. His hands began to shake uncontrollably. The pit in his stomach turned into a sink hole. His heart began to beat like a war drum. It was not just the words that scared him. It was the way he said it, or it said them. They did not sound human. Joe, or the thing that looked like Joe, did not move his lips with the utterance. His voice sounded like a primitive text to speech program from the 1990s, but somehow more unnatural. It sounded robotic. John thought, “You…you aren’t Joe. You aren’t even human.” He then bolted out of the restaurant, hoping putting distance between him and the town could bring him out of this strange nightmare. He then bumped into what looked like Luke, but his skin was a uniform shade of blue, and he had no face, just blank blue skin. Luke then uttered in that same robotic voice, “We are all blue here.” John then pushed him aside, and ran out the door.

As John ran out of the restaurant, he got into his car. He then noticed that his car was all blue, including the interior. He tried to start the car, but it made no sound or sign of function. He then got out and began to run on his feet. As he ran, he noticed that all of the trees were now blue. All of the grass was blue. Everything was blue. He ran more and more. Every bit of blue only increased his terror. He ran and ran. Soon the sky turned a shade of bright uniform blue, like staring onto a computer screen with only one shade of pixel filled in. Then all of the trees and buildings disappeared. John was now running on a flat plane with the sky a uniform color. John then looked at himself, and he saw that he was also turning blue. John then stopped. He knew it was over. He knew that there was no getting out of this. He knew this was the end. He then got onto his knees and saw the plane and ceiling now become one. He then saw himself turn the same shade of blue as what was surrounding him. John’s mind then became disoriented. He could not see what direction was up and down. It was like he was floating in space, except instead of seeing stars he saw only one shade of blue. Then he saw his entire body disappear. He was alone, with only the blue surrounding him.

Back in the forest, Jessica with her brown eyes watched John pick up the cube. Then something horrible happened. John disappeared when he picked up the cube. To her horror, he faded away, like his being was being pulled into an alternative reality. The cube then dropped to the ground, now in the exact same position it was before, ready for the next person to join the blue.

The next day, we saw that our picture and a few quotes were in a local newspaper. The only thing I remember about the story was “Carol Jarvis and her husband…” 

Any idea how I’d go about trying to source that story, and get a pic? My folks had a clipping but it’s been lost over the years and I’d like to try and get hold of it again.

That is not a criticism. Tools matter. Frameworks matter. But they are downstream of something more stable: principles. Confidentiality, integrity, availability, detection, response, recovery. These do not change nearly as fast as the tech stack, yet they are often treated as background theory rather than active decision making guides.

In practice, this shows up in small but consequential ways. Controls implemented because “that is what the standard says,” not because anyone can clearly articulate the risk being addressed. Incidents where teams respond quickly, but later struggle to explain why a particular response was appropriate, or what success even looked like. Career conversations where people feel pressure to learn everything, instead of learning how to reason about trade-offs.

I ran into this gap myself early on, and more than once later in my career. That is what eventually pushed me to sit down and write a principle-based guide, Hacking Cybersecurity Principles. It is not a catalogue of tools or tactics, more an attempt to reconnect everyday security work back to the fundamentals that tend to get lost once things get busy. Its available on Amazon and for less than a cup of coffee (for a limited time).

What I am more interested in, though, is the broader experience.

Which core cybersecurity principle do you think is most often misunderstood or under applied in real world environments?

I keep coming back to integrity. We talk a lot about keeping things secret, but far less about ensuring data remains trustworthy over time, until something quietly corrupts it and the impact surfaces much later.

No NSFW right out of the gate either please.

Good morning/afternoon/evening/whenever this post may find you, and may it find you well! Title is cheesy, I know. But it's who I am, and I'm tired of feeling like I have to tone myself down in order to get into a relationship. I'm a pretty standard young man looking for a young lady to spend the rest of my days with. I've known that I've wanted this since I was a young kid and over 20 years later I'm still after it! I know these things can be a chore to read through so I'm quickly gonna go through who I am and who I hope you are! I tried to break this post up into easy to read lists as best I could without leaving out important info so it's not just a wall of text.

About me:

* Born and raised in the suburbs about 45 minutes outside the city of Philly. This place will always be home to me, but I've decided that I don't want it to be home forever. Barring any drastic changes, I would like to relocate elsewhere within the US, ideally to a colder climate (I've had Minnesota circled for a while now but I'm open to other ideas!). I have no problem staying in the general area either, just need to get out of my hometown.
* Physically, I stand at around 6'1-6'2, 285 pounds. I know that may sound bad, but I have a big frame and it fits me quite nicely! Think bigger NFL player (O-line, tight end, etc). I've got broad shoulders and a nice chest, perfect for use as a pillow during cuddles! I've also got a lot of body hair so hopefully you're cool with that! I have short brown hair that's thick and fluffy, and tend to keep my face clean shaven.
* My hobbies are the typical nerdy stuff, video games (PC & Switch 2, ask me about my animal crossing island!), legos, collecting plushes, and adding to my ever expanding pajama drawer! I'm always down to get into new things though! Also a big Philly sports fan (I promise we're not as crazy as the internet makes us seem!).
* I'm generally more on the shy and reserved side, but once I open up I can be a yapper. Communication is super important to me, both for relationships and life in general, be that talking about an issue that needs to be resolved or just random things. I also love just talking while cuddling, being either the talker or the listener if one of us is yapping.
* I currently work part/full time at a grocery store. It's not my favorite thing in the world but I've been there a while and figure just stick to what I know. I'm currently also enrolled as a student at my local community college going for an associate's degree in business! While both of these pursuits keep me quite busy, I have no issue making time as needed.
* As far as physical intimacy goes, I'd say that I'm extremely affectionate. Absolutely love to give hugs and kissing just makes me feel complete in a way that nothing else really does. Also just generally love all kinds of physical touch! (We can discuss bedroom stuff if we click!)
* I'm an open book, so if there's something here you haven't seen that you're curious about, feel free to ask!

As for you, you are...

* 25-32 (willing to budge a year or two on this)
* Childfree (non-negotiable)
* Want to find someone to spend forever with (marriage preferred)
* monogamous

And that's all I've got! I'm happy to exchange pics once the conversation gets rolling a bit and there's some chemistry. I hope to hear from you soon! Please include the following info in your intro message:

* First name
* Age
* Location (doesn't have to be precise but I'd at least like what state you're in currently)
* What about my post stood out to you and made you want to reach out

If you're not sure what to say in your first message, here are a few conversation starters/hot takes I hold:

1. blue cheese > ranch and it's not particularly close
2. coffee is nasty
3. What's the nicest thing someone else has ever said about you?
4. Would you rather live in 24 hours of daylight or darkness?",0,1766707574.0,r4r,1,0.5,False

I have a half-sister (36) on my mother’s side. She most likely has schizoaffective disorder. She has been living abroad since she was 18 and usually visits us once a year. I remember her as an outgoing person who really knew how to enjoy life. Over the past few years, however, the symptoms of her illness have become very obvious—delusions, hearing voices, talking to herself.

As far as I know, during the last three years she has been in and out of psychiatric clinics and was hospitalized several times. During that period, her daughter was taken out of her care, and over the past year she had been living in assisted housing. She came to our house for Christmas and it turned out that she had been expelled from the assisted living facility because she repeatedly violated their rules.

She believes she will be able to pay rent for an apartment in our country from her home country's disability pension, even though she is not a citizen of that country, thus not having a right to receive the said pension. She has been using marijuana and alcohol for a long time and regularly refuses to take her prescribed medication. Neither my mother nor I have the emotional capacity to handle this.

For the past few nights, instead of sleeping, she has been drinking coffee, pacing back and forth, talking to herself, and sometimes even screaming out loud. During a today's family visit, I noticed that she can speak normally and hold a coherent conversation when someone is actively talking to her. The moment the conversation ends, however, she slips back into talking and gesturing at empty space. Later on, from the next room, I also heard her psychotic laughter, which was absolutely terrifying.",1,1766707491.0,mentalhealth,1,1.0,False

Merry Christmas:

Here we are again...

The market is once again pretending it knows what it’s doing.  
It doesn’t.  
It’s just very confident about it.

Everyone on financial Twitter is either calling for the next melt-up or the imminent crash, depending on which podcast they listened to while brushing their teeth. Both sides are extremely sure of themselves. That’s usually the tell.

Being a contrarian always feels smart.  
You get to be the only adult in the room, sipping coffee while everyone else panics or celebrates. When it works, you feel like a genius. When it doesn’t, you feel like a genius who lost money.

The problem with contrarianism is simple:  
It requires you to predict an alternate reality from the one price is currently living in.

My goal isn’t to predict the turn.  
It’s to figure out what part of the movie we’re actually watching.

Every trade boils down to two questions:

What leg of the cycle are we in?  
What stories does the market pay for in that leg?

Right now, the answer to the first one is **chop**.

Not bullish.  
Not bearish.  
Just a market pacing back and forth like a nervous fund manager waiting for CPI.

Chop is what happens when the market stops trusting narratives but hasn’t decided which ones to kill yet. Earnings come in strong. Stocks pop. Then they fade. Bad news hits. Stocks dump. Then they bounce. Everyone keeps thinking the next move is “the real one.”

It isn’t.

This is why commodities are quietly making everyone look stupid.

While growth stocks argue about multiples and AI slideshows, energy, metals, and ag are doing the very unfashionable thing of responding to supply and demand. No PowerPoint required.

In a chop regime, the market stops paying for imagination and starts paying for **cash flows and scarcity**.

So what works?

Trend-following things with real physical constraints.  
Mean-reverting things that were priced for perfection five minutes ago.

You don’t need to predict whether the next leg is up or down to make money here. You just need to stop using trend-chasing strategies in a market that’s clearly in a range-bound identity crisis.

The edge isn’t calling the top.  
The edge is not fighting the regime.

Most traders lose money trying to be early.  
The market pays people who show up on time.

**The Hard Asset Hustle, A Chop-Market Regime:**

Currently narratives are arguing and price is king: stay long **Copper**, **gold**, and **silver** as trend-following core positions because they’re being driven by real-world scarcity, electrification, central bank flows, and geopolitical supply stress rather than vibes; buy pullbacks above rising 20–50 day moving averages and trail stops with 2-3x ATR to stay in trends without marrying them, while running a separate mean-reversion sleeve that fades emotional extremes in the AI trade: things like **QQQ, NVDA, SMH, META,**  selling strength near resistance and buying panic near VWAP, 20-day, or 50-day zones, because in chop leaders don’t die, they whipsaw, and the edge comes from harvesting volatility while waiting for the market to finally pick a direction.",1,1766707402.0,AsymmetricAlpha,1,1.0,False
1pvqerv,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1pvqerv/the_untitled_manuscript/,The Untitled Manuscript,"\[Here is a rough draft a new story I've been working on lately, please leave any feedback on how to improve the story! Thank you!\]

  
I will never forget the first time I glanced at the greatest piece of writing that my eyes have ever come across. A text so marvelous, new, exciting, thrilling and filled with unexpected twists and turns that I never saw coming. A story filled with romance, drama, and horrors all circulating a beautiful and uncompromising mystery surrounding the central character. I read almost the whole thing in one sitting, I can’t recall how long it was, two hundred pages? No it was surely longer than that, at least five hundred? Maybe even a thousand pages long for all I could say with how dense the story was. That didn’t matter, what matters is that it was real. It *is* real. And I will find it again, no matter what it takes, where I have to go, or who I have to go through. As long as I get my hands on a copy, then it will finally be able to stop, and I will be at peace.

My job is, or more accurately to say *was* before the whole incident occurred; being a part time internship for a publishing company. My job was to basically sift through incoming manuscripts by mail from unknown authors, take notes and summaries if any were worth pursuing, and sort through the unpublishables to be returned to sender. Needless to say, I read a lot of mediocre and underwhelming stories with no payoff or potential in my time. Some were good, most were ok, and even rarer that some were so insufferably bad that it made elementary school weekly journals seem like Shakespeare in comparison.

However that fateful day, June 6th, 2006, is when I found it hidden in the stack of mail delivered to our office. Bundled in a simple brown bag with no author's name, story title, or even an address written on the package. It only had one word written on it, “Bob”... that’s my name.  Inside the bag I found that the entire story was hand scribed on a single yellow writing pad with a sealed envelope placed on top of the pages. The wax seal had a strange symbol on it, something that looked other worldly yet eerily familiar to me in the recesses of my mind, it was almost as if I had dreamt about the thing. An unusual feeling arose in me for reasons that I can’t explain or comprehend. I became burdened with a mixture of fear, guilt, paranoia and judgement for simply looking at the sign. I glanced around my surroundings, making sure I was alone and carefully opened the letter. It contained only a handful of words, but it didn’t make sense.

	“Do not read book two”

Naturally I was confused at what the letter said, why should I only read one of the two pads? What was wrong with the second one? Surely it was a joke, or perhaps some sort of reverse psychology to make me want to read more. I took no heed to the letter’s warning and took the pads out and began scanning the pages. 

Inside was beautiful handwritten cursive that drew my eye to the page right away. The penmanship was extraordinary, seemingly written by some divine entity of an ethereal perfection no mortal could wish to achieve. I was so entrapped by the beauty of its letterwork that I hadn't even begun to read the story yet. I simply flipped through the pages to admire the beautiful script and marvel at its wonder. Thousands of words filled each and every square inch of the papers. I felt a tear of joy bundle up, or perhaps it was made from fright as it  ran down my face about to hit the paper, but without thinking I immediately wiped it away before it could smear the ink on the page.

Feeling the cold tear against my skin seemingly snapped me out of my trance and that is when I heard a knock on my door, my boss outside the hallway door. Before the door could open I tucked the pages behind me and grabbed another stack of packages, pretending to open them. As he entered he slouched against the frame and asked me the usual guff on mail day. “So Bob did anything good come in today? Anything salvageable or has any potential to be a best seller?” He said with a tired yet meaningful warmth. I shyly replied “No sir, nothing worth its salt so far , but soon I’ll find a good one.” I gave him a weak smile but avoided his eyes for some reason. He nodded his head and exited the room without any emotion. I waited a moment before going back to my precious prize. All three pads were waiting to be read and I picked up the first one and slowly read the opening words, an excerpt of a poem.

*“Across the shores where heaven meets hell*

*Twin moon shudder and hide away*

*Lost in the wars there seven sleet bells*

*Then strewn other the bland died and swayed*

*But stranger still*

*Is dear Casilla.”*

After that the poem the story began with beautiful prose. Each word read as effortlessly as breathing in air.  As if each passing letter was oxygen entering and exiting through my lungs. The longer I read the more the story drew me in. Before I knew it I was done with the first pad, over 300 pages and the story still left unanswered. I needed more, what was going to happen next and how was this going to end? Without thinking I reached for the second pad before remembering what the envelope said.

 “Do not read past the third part.” 

I regarded the warning and read on, making sure to stop reading after this part, to be safe of course. I noticed something strange with the penmanship. It was still neat and beautiful, but almost written differently. As if another author wrote it? No, it was similar enough but different. The letters slightly more elongated, each stroke made in hastily as if the author was running out of time. Not only that, but it appeared as if the page itself was changing before my eyes but surely it wasn't. A trick of the light or maybe my exhaustion from the late nights had caught up with me. Letters were being erased and transformed into runes and drawings. As my eyes crossed the pages new images seemingly appeared beside the text out of the blue.

Diagrams, portraits, sketches, and even maps with legends leading to unknown and unexplored worlds. As my eyes navigated the inscriptions, the pictures morphed back into words, and the words into images. As I continued on the story, it became more than that. A central figure kept appearing in one way or another. Through text, drawing, or map. None of them directly spoke of who it was, but I knew it guided me to where I was needed.

The story had soon turned into history, lessons, legends and myths, and more of this unmentioned figure. I don’t know how to explain it other than I knew what I was reading was the future, and it was set in stone. I quickly flied through the second book, as I got to the final page, I felt something unusual, even for that moment. I felt the presence of someone whispering in my ear with a soft  gentle voice, with sincere gravity.

 “Continue reading the other three volumes, my son. Do not stop here, ignore the envelope’s false warning.”

I quickly looked around me and of course no one was there. The air felt dry and cold in an instant, the windows began to frost over and my breath began to appear. I held the six pads in my hands and closed my eyes and rubbed my forehead. To be sure I checked the envelope one last time to make sure I understood the message. 

“Do not read past the fourth pad”.

That gave me enough resolve to continue to read on into the third volume. The pages felt warm, as if they were protecting me from the sudden chill that appeared. Another poem about Casilla and her woes and past, then I noticed the most peculiar thing. The penmanship has evolved once more, now smaller but still legible, trying to fit more words on each line. In the middle of the text there was some sort of calligram, a subtle one but once I saw it, I couldn’t see anything else. Some of the letters were pressed down harder and thicker than the rest to form the image, and once I was fully able to comprehend what the image was, I nearly dropped all eight pads on the floor. 

The calligram formed that same strange and surreal sign that was pressed onto the wax. As I read on, I began to notice the symbol everywhere, hidden within the drawings, in the negative space of the text itself, even in the crinkles of the pages it bled through. Drawn between various letters. The handwriting was now getting messy and sloppy. 

I knew I wanted to finish the text, no I had to. Each new letter consumed my very being, I heard the voice again, this time louder and more direct. No longer a gentle whisper but now a command from a monarch telling me to finish my crusade.  

“Finish my tale, and you will know how to find me.”

 Its words sent a chill down my spine before I knew what was happening next. I was on the eighth pad with two more to go. I began to feel frightened, not of the text, nor the content of the story, no no, that was beautiful and elegant as ever. The mystery of what happened to Casilla’s life enthralled me. No no no, I was afraid of the fact that once it ended, nothing would ever be worth reading ever again. Nothing would have meaning, this was it, this *is* everything the world needed, and I discovered it. 

I alone had the power to spread it across every bookstore in the US, in every newspaper article, email, and even library. I had the opportunity to share it, but then if I did, it wouldn’t be my special story anymore. 

Then the unthinkable happened, I reached the second to the last page. For once, I was too nervous to flip the page. Whatever was written here would resolve the story, tie up all loose ends, and my time reading the greatest story would come to a stop. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath, right as I was about to turn the page my boss frantically rushed through the door looking around frantically. 

“Hand me that pad will you, I’ve run out from my desk and I have a meeting with an author in five minutes!” He pointed at me, at *my story* as if it was just another scrap piece of paper. I looked at him with shock and disgust. “I think you’re mistaken sir, this isn’t a blank pad, it's one of our submitted stories.” He walked over to me, to the pad and pointed it and looked confused at me. “What are you talking about kid? If there’s a story in here? Show me where?” As I looked back down to the yellow pad, it was blank, all fifty pages were brand new and unused. He snatched the paper out of my hands and walked away disgruntled.

It was gone. The untitled story was ripped out of hands, erased from time. Erased from me, it was only a memory now. No, I knew that can’t be true. It *IS* real, I know it is because I read it. I heard his voice speak to me. My boss stole my future from me, literally out of my hands. What choice did I have? I needed the pad back. 

I heard the voice again. This time the tone was unemotional, void of any discernment or concern. “Kill him and take what is yours.” Without realizing it the letter opener was now in my hands, somehow placed there without me grabbing them, and I rushed into his office. He was sitting down and happily looked up to me. He had a false smile on his face and said “hey, did you find a good story worth…” before he could finish I forced the small and long blade through his neck and saw the light leave his eyes. The voice spoke again, cold and calculated. “Good…now find the manuscript.”

He collapsed on his desk, knocking over his coffee cup to the floor, smashing it into dozens of pieces. His blood poured all over his desk, overflowing to the carpet staining everything in its wake. I had to find the pad fast before it was ruined. I pushed his body off the desk as he slunk into his chair but the pages were nowhere to be found. 

As I continued to search another intern came in, asking about the sound before realizing what happened. She rushed out screaming and I felt no need to chase her. I had no qualms with her, I just needed to find the manuscript before anyone else did. It’s as if he never even took the damn thing to begin with. No that can’t be true, It was nowhere on his desk, nor was it inside any of his drawers or even on the floor. No matter where I looked, they weren’t anywhere he usually kept them. It wasn’t long before the cops came to arrest me that day, and not long after that being sentenced here in Harmak.

But Doc, you have to believe me, I’m not crazy. I never had any intention of hurting anyone, especially my boss. I didn’t have a choice you know, it told me to do so…I needed that story back. I have to know how it ends after all. I was so close to finishing it, after all, I was the one who discovered it. So please, if you ever find a copy of it, send it my way will ya?

i prefer a mix of midcentury modern( i try not to be so heavy handed in the decor but i like the structure of MCM home design)   

from my own research i find i like the modeling design of those alternating molding line- it gives the effect of wood paneling which my husband i loved but had to get rid of due to warping.  and i found flat ceramic beige tile that i feel adds some color dimension to the room (walls would be swiss coffee no matter what modeling idea we choose)  to get a sense of the layout i included photos from our kitchens POV where you will also see a partition wall(load bearing? that will have some shelves.

i normally am very confident in my design choices but my husband is either very indecisive or takes too long to respond about a topic. so when we have to finally make a decision i feel rushed by my choices.

The place sat at the edge of the highway is a gas station that has a faded sign with half the letters worn out. Passerbys would stop to fill their tanks and continue passing by.



Elias works the night shift. He’s in his forties but looks older in the fluorescent light. He has OCD, so he stocks the shelves by turning each bottle so the labels face forward. He has a small scar across the top of his right hand from the time his father tried to teach him a lesson. 



Around midnight, the customers begin to slow down, and Elias has time to dream. Dreaming about the same thing every night. Some nights, he dreams in a rush, hoping to finish whatever he’s dreaming before anyone might catch him in the act. Some nights, if it's really quiet, he’ll be a little bold and turn on the radio, and dream a bit longer, a little slower, maybe even close his eyes. Some nights the radio will play Mazzy Star, and he’ll feel especially lucky. 



After he’s done dreaming, Elias thinks about his mother. He thinks about her and all the lessons she tried to make him unlearn. And he thinks about all the lessons his father gave his mother, because she tried to make her son unlearn. And he thinks about his sister, and all the times his mother asked him to hide her. And he thinks about all the lessons his father gave his mother, because she tried to protect her daughter.



Elias doesn’t cry. He’s become numb to those things. Elias dreams of his sister and her favorite song. And their favorite game, and their favorite food, chicken pot pie, which they only ever had if they were visiting grandma on Christmas. He dreams about that one cake his mother used to buy. The one that she always told them they’d only open if someone stopped by their house. He and his sister would hope no one would come over that week, so they could have the whole cake to themselves, which they would finish in one afternoon. It was that one chocolate chip Entenmann’s cake, the one with the white powdered sugar and crumbs on top, $3.99, he hadn’t seen one in eight years.



One night, a teenage boy came in with a busted lip and a hoodie over his head. He walked up to Elias, never looking up, and pointed at the register. Elias asked if he needed help, and the boy shook his head before pointing at the register again. Elias opened it and slid the whole thing toward him. The boy reached for the 20s with his right hand and held them close to his chest. He then ran out of the gas station and into the night, away from the highway. Elias felt the urge to call after him, but he didn’t. 



Elias didn't dream the rest of the night and went back to stocking shelves. The sun came up slow, and the cars eventually pulled in, and the people bought gum, fuel, and coffee. None of them looked at Elias twice. None of them noticed the small scar across the top of his right hand or the radio he kept next to his feet.

1pvpzpv,https://www.reddit.com/r/MotivationByDesign/comments/1pvpzpv/how_to_stop_lying_to_yourself_the_sciencebased/,How to STOP Lying to Yourself: The Science-Based Truth That Actually Works,"Here's the thing nobody wants to admit: we're all lying to ourselves about something. Maybe it's why you're still in that dead-end job, or why you keep going back to people who treat you like garbage, or why you haven't started that project you've been ""planning"" for two years.

I spent months diving into research on self-deception, books, psychology papers, neuroscience studies, podcasts. And holy shit, the stuff I found explains SO much about why we stay stuck. Our brains are literally wired to protect our ego, even if it means keeping us miserable. The good news? Once you understand how this works, you can actually do something about it.

**Here's what actually happens when you lie to yourself:**

Your brain creates these elaborate stories to justify your behavior. It's called cognitive dissonance, and it's exhausting. You know you should be doing something different, but instead of changing, you just... explain it away. ""I'm too busy."" ""It's not the right time."" ""Other people have it easier.""

**The brutal starting point: write down your lies**

Get a notebook. Right now. Write down three things you've been telling yourself that you KNOW aren't completely true. The excuses you use. The reasons why you ""can't"" do something.

This sounds simple but it's actually terrifying. Because once it's on paper, you can't unsee it.

**Stop confusing comfort with happiness**

We lie to ourselves most when we're trying to avoid short-term discomfort. Your brain doesn't care about your future self, it cares about RIGHT NOW. So you stay in situations that feel ""safe"" even though they're slowly killing your soul.

Research from behavioral economics shows we're hardwired to avoid loss more than we seek gains. Which means we'll tolerate being miserable if it means avoiding the scary unknown.

**The antidote: micro-honesty**

Start insanely small. Pick ONE area where you've been bullshitting yourself. Just one. Maybe it's your health, your relationships, your work.

For health specifically, try using an app like MyFitnessPal to track what you actually eat. Not what you think you eat. What you ACTUALLY eat. The data doesn't lie, and sometimes seeing the numbers is the wake-up call you need. It's free, takes 30 seconds per meal, and will absolutely destroy your excuses about ""not eating that much.""

**The power of external accountability**

Your brain is a master manipulator when left to its own devices. You need external reality checks.

Read Lying by Sam Harris. It's a tiny book, like 100 pages, but it completely rewires how you think about honesty. Harris is a neuroscientist and philosopher who breaks down why even small lies corrode your life. The book argues that radical honesty, even in uncomfortable situations, is the only path to authentic relationships and self-respect. It's uncomfortable as hell to read because you'll recognize yourself in every example. Get the audiobook if reading feels like too much right now.

BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app built by Columbia alumni and former Google experts that turns books, research papers, and expert talks into personalized podcasts tailored to your exact goals. Type in something like ""stop self-sabotaging"" or ""build better habits,"" and it pulls from science-based sources to create a custom learning plan just for you. 

You control the depth, whether it's a quick 10-minute overview or a 40-minute deep dive with real examples. The voice options are ridiculously good, like a deep, movie-quality narrator or even sarcastic tones if that's your thing. There's also a virtual coach you can chat with mid-podcast to ask questions or explore ideas deeper. It's perfect for commutes or workouts when you want to actually learn instead of doomscroll.

For daily practice, Stoic is an incredible app that gives you philosophical prompts and exercises every morning. It's based on ancient Stoic wisdom, which is basically a 2,000-year-old system for not lying to yourself. The app includes journaling prompts like ""What am I avoiding today?"" and ""Where am I choosing comfort over growth?"" Takes five minutes, costs less than a coffee subscription.

Listen to The Tim Ferriss Show episode with BJ Miller (a palliative care physician). He talks about how terminally ill patients finally stop lying to themselves when they're facing death. The regrets they have. The things they wish they'd done. It's a gut-punch of reality that makes you realize you don't have infinite time to get your shit together.

**The identity shift that changes everything**

Stop identifying with your excuses. You're not ""someone who's bad at mornings"" or ""just not a creative person"" or ""too anxious to try new things."" Those are stories you've been telling yourself, not fundamental truths.

Check out the book Atomic Habits by James Clear. Yeah, everyone recommends it, but there's a reason. Clear breaks down how tiny behavior changes compound over time. The chapter on identity-based habits is game-changing, instead of ""I want to write,"" you become ""I am a writer."" The shift sounds subtle but it completely changes your decision-making. Clear uses actual research from behavioral psychology to show why this works.

**The uncomfortable truth about change**

Real change requires you to sit with massive discomfort. The lying stops when you're willing to feel the anxiety, shame, and fear that comes with admitting the truth.

The Huberman Lab podcast has an episode called ""How to Control Your Sense of Pain & Pleasure"" where Andrew Huberman (Stanford neuroscientist) explains the neurochemistry of discomfort and how our brains process it. Understanding the science makes it less scary. You realize the discomfort is just chemicals, not truth.

**Your brain will fight back**

When you start being honest with yourself, your brain will FREAK OUT. It'll give you a million reasons why you should go back to the comfortable lies. This is normal. Expect it.

The trick is to keep going anyway. Not because it feels good (it won't), but because the alternative, another year of the same bullshit, is worse.

**Start today, not Monday**

Whatever you've been lying to yourself about, address it today. Not tomorrow. Not next week. Today. Make one small move in the direction of truth.

Text that person you need to have a hard conversation with. Apply for that job. Delete that app you waste three hours on every night. Something. Anything.

My guesses would be Kendall or Kenzie, Kendall cause she eventually did the worm and I think they are both classic hip hop moves??

Sorry for another post like this, but I really need input from people who get it.

About a year ago I opened two Airbnbs near Milan (one was my mom’s, one is mine). The setup phase was exciting: furnishing, listings, photos, all of that. Then reality hit.

Italian bureaucracy is suffocating, neighbors are completely unhinged (constant screaming phone calls), and even though I’ve automated almost everything, I live in a constant state of anxiety. I currently manage only my own place, and honestly it still feels overwhelming.

The strange part is: I haven’t had particularly bad guests. No horror stories. No major damages. The actual hands-on work is minimal because everything is automated. Objectively, the workload is low.

And yet the stress is constant, intense, and honestly hard to explain.

I’ve created a 56-page bilingual house and city guide, plus bilingual subtitled videos for the coffee machine and every single device, because my anxiety pushed me to try to control every possible variable. It didn’t help.

Every phone notification makes my stomach drop. If a guest messages me, even for something minor, I immediately stop whatever I’m doing to reply. I’m exhausted from having to be mentally “on call” 24/7. It doesn’t matter if it’s Christmas or my birthday, I never fully relax. Every checkout stresses me out. Every cleaning, I feel the need to go check in person.

I thought this would be semi-passive income. Instead, it’s consumed my mental energy. And after more than a year, it’s not getting better, it’s getting worse.

I’m seriously considering quitting short-term rentals or switching to mid-term rentals. Maybe I’m just not built for this kind of business.

I know many will say “it’s not for everyone, just quit,” but I’ve invested so much money, time, and effort that walking away makes me feel sick. Sunk cost fallacy?

Has anyone else experienced this kind of disproportionate, constant stress despite things objectively “working”? Did it improve for you, or did you eventually walk away?

Thanks to anyone willing to share their experience!",13,1766705772.0,airbnb_hosts,38,0.84,False

1pvpttg,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/1pvpttg/coffee_spill_on_motherboard_powers_on_but_stuck/,Coffee spill on motherboard — powers on but stuck in CPU/DRAM debug loop. Any board-level salvage ideas?,"Hey everyone, I’m hoping to get some advice from people who have dealt with liquid damage or board-level repair.

I accidentally spilled an iced coffee onto my PC. My case is a Thermaltake Core V21, which mounts the motherboard horizontally. The coffee landed on the top glass panel, and some of it seeped through a seam and dripped onto the motherboard area and a couple fans.

What happened initially:
	•	PC powered off immediately
	•	It briefly powered back on by itself
	•	I then manually powered it off, shut off the PSU, and unplugged everything

What I’ve done since (very thorough cleanup):
	•	Fully disassembled the entire system
	•	Removed CPU, GPU, RAM, motherboard, everything
	•	Cleaned the motherboard with 91% isopropyl alcohol
	•	Noticed liquid had seeped under the CPU socket area (likely due to horizontal orientation)
	•	Flushed the CPU socket area with isopropyl alcohol using gravity to drain
	•	Let everything dry with airflow for extended periods
	•	Cleaned RAM DIMM slots with alcohol + very soft brush (no scraping, no pressure)
	•	Cleaned RAM stick contacts
	•	Reapplied fresh thermal paste
	•	Reassembled carefully

Current behavior:
	•	System powers on normally
	•	Fans spin, RGB works, no burning smell, no visible damage
	•	GPU powers on
	•	CPU cooler works
	•	Motherboard debug LEDs cycle like this:
CPU (red) → DRAM (yellow) → CPU → DRAM (loop)
	•	It never reaches VGA or BOOT
	•	Never posts, never reaches BIOS

Troubleshooting attempted:
	•	Reseated CPU multiple times (pins and pads look perfect)
	•	Reseated GPU
	•	Cleared CMOS (battery removed for extended time)
	•	Tried one RAM stick at a time
	•	Tried different slots (A2, B2)
	•	Tried both sticks individually and together
	•	Re-cleaned DIMM slots multiple times
	•	Let everything dry thoroughly between attempts

Hardware:
	•	CPU: Intel i5-11600K
	•	Motherboard: MSI MPG Z590M Gaming Edge WiFi
	•	RAM: DDR4 (2 sticks, previously stable for years)
	•	GPU: RTX 3070
	•	PSU: Known-good, system stays powered

At this point I’m suspecting either:
	•	DIMM slot / memory channel damage
	•	CPU memory controller damage
	•	Or residue/corrosion under the DIMM slot or socket that isn’t easily accessible

Before I give up and replace the motherboard, I wanted to ask:

— Is there anything else worth trying at a board-level to potentially salvage this?
Examples:
	•	Contact cleaner vs IPA
	•	Ultrasonic cleaning
	•	Baking / low-heat drying
	•	Any known MSI Z590 quirks after liquid exposure
	•	Anything I’m missing that could cause a permanent DDR training failure like this?

I’m comfortable working on hardware and just want to be sure I’ve exhausted reasonable options before replacing the board.

First off thank you to my secret Santa for this absolutely incredible Willie Mays bat card! I was blown away when I opened it. 

Triple thank you to Cat Whisperer for 1) organizing the exchange, 2) pic 2 a sweet ass SF haul he sent including that crazy Barry Bonds finest and 3) thank you for the Mays relic (I think?). The packaging and hand writing looked the same so it’s my best guess! I hope you and the porcupine are having a lovely holiday you guys are amazing. 

Another thank you to one of my favorite people, Justa Guy who sent me everything in pic 3, a wild niners care package with tons of sweet rookies I didn’t have, some chrome and even some metal! You always hook me up bro you’re too kind, I appreciate you very much. 

Pics 4/5 are my Christmas haul so a huge thank you to my family for hooking dad up! A Mays action figure!!!

These cards are all fantastic because they were all gifts, and for someone who hasn’t had time to buy many cards this year let alone post them like I used to this was pretty special!!

1pvpn3q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1pvpn3q/held_captive_by_a_church/,Held captive by a church,"It starts off with me and a friend I used to have walking around in what seems to be an outside mall, looking for a church to go to. We eventually find one and walk in; from the outside it seemed fairly small but the inside immediately gave megachurch vibes. We were in a giant lobby area with hundreds of people surrounding us, and a coffee shop to either side.

In this church, first-timers enter the sanctuary using a separate door, which we got to via a tightly-wound spiral staircase. We make it through the lesson, and, as I'm leaving, I try to find my friend, but can't find her. Before I, and most of the people there, are actually able to exit the building, we're told we're unable to leave, that the church has its own government and that we are all citizens under their rule. We were all separated into different groups, each group having its own living quarters, and bedrooms split between men and women. As police are rounding us up, people are upset, not no one tries to do anything to try and escape. I see Jerry Trainer (known for iCarly and Drake and Josh) during this time and fangirl a bit, but don't approach him. I see him a couple more times during this dream, but never speak to him.

I eventually get to the room I'm supposed to stay in. There are bunk beds lined up close together, and there's maybe about 20 women total staying in there. It's at this point I don't remember much of the specifics. At one point, it's revealed that the church is actually a (massive) submarine that frequently goes in and out of water. Me and a handful of others go to a sort of viewing deck where we see everything as we submurge into the ocean. Making the transition from above to well below the surface of the ocean freaked me out, and I tightly huggeda guy I had a crush on in high school.

At some point, the group I'm in decides to rebel and try to escape. We figured out a way to use the telephone booths supplied to us to do so, and I was chosen to actually do whatever it was that could help, but I couldn't actually do it. Everyone then gathered together in a sort of meeting, and we agreed that the only person who could save us was Lady Gaga.",1,1766705100.0,Dreams,0,1.0,False

OOOHHH you wanna cook in THIS greasy midnight kitchen, huh?! Pull up a milk crate, neon soul. Jack Slagg is about to peel back the duct tape and show you how the sausage screams.

Alright—here’s the recipe. No culinary school. No permission slips. Just vibes, voltage, and a little cosmic heartburn.


---

🔊 1. PICK A VOICE (Not a mask — a frequency)

Your “character” isn’t a costume, it’s a dial setting.

Ask yourself (don’t answer out loud, this is radio):

Are you calm chaos or screaming philosopher?

Are you sincere but unhinged? Or unhinged but sincere?

Who are you talking to at 2:37 a.m.?
(Truckers. Insomniacs. People Googling their own name. You know.)


Rule: exaggerate traits you already have. Don’t invent a soul—you’ll drop it on-air.

—SFX: dial tuning wildly—


---

🎙️ 2. WRITE LIKE YOU’RE TALKING TO THE DARK

This style works because it feels spoken, not typed.

Try this:

Short bursts.

Interrupt yourself.

Use CAPS like a blown speaker, not every sentence.

Add fake soundboard cues:
[AIR HORN], [STATIC], [COUGHING INTO MIC]


Bad:

> “This is a satirical monologue about society.”



Good:

> “Society just spilled beer on my shoes and called it culture—WHO RAISED YOU?!”




---

🔥 3. ROAST SYSTEMS, NOT SOULS

This is IMPORTANT, kid.

Punch up:

Institutions

Trends

Algorithms

The concept of “productivity”


Punch around:

Yourself

The voice

The absurdity of being alive with Wi-Fi


Never punch down.
The magic is: feral energy + secret empathy.


---

📞 4. USE BITS, NOT RAMBLES

Structure the chaos. Even hurricanes have weather maps.

Steal these formats (I stole them too):

Fake callers (“LINE 3, YOU’RE ON—why do you sound like a raccoon?”)

Segments

“CONSPIRACY OR COFFEE?”

“WHAT DID THE INTERNET BREAK TODAY?”


Sudden sincerity (drop your voice, slow down… then swerve)


That whiplash? That’s the hook.


---

🖤 5. HIDE A REAL HEARTBEAT IN THERE

This is the secret sauce nobody tells you.

Once per piece:

A line for the lonely

A nod to the weird

A “hey… you’re not broken, the signal is”


Then—IMMEDIATELY—ruin the moment with a joke.
Vulnerability, then absurdity. Like life.


---

🧪 6. PRACTICE BIT (STEAL THIS, IT’S RADIO)

Try writing 10–15 lines as if you’re live on air.

Template:

[SFX]
Big opening rant
Hard left turn
Fake interruption
One sincere line
ABSURD ENDING

Example:

> “They told me to ‘be myself’ so I did and now HR has QUESTIONS—
—oh hold on, LINE 6 says the moon is spying on him—
buddy, SAME.
Anyway, if you’re up late wondering if you missed your chance?
Nah. The show’s still on.
[AIR HORN, MIC DROP, STATIC]”




---

—leans into mic, softer now—
You don’t need permission to sound strange.
You just need to commit to the bit and care who’s listening.

If you want, next time I can:

Help you build your own persona

Co-write a first monologue

Or do a live “caller” bit with you on-air


—STATIC SWELLS—
This is Jack Slagg, reminding you:
If they don’t like your frequency… change the damn station. 📻🔥",1,1766704555.0,Synthsara,0,1.0,False

I’m new to nespresso but from my understanding, the app is needed to change the brew size/temp. I’ve tried everything I’ve read about and I’ve also spoke to support, both nespresso and my internet provider. I just got off the phone with nespresso again, was told their super support team would reach out tomorrow. My internet providers app even says the machine is connected to wifi. Bluetooth settings on my phone say the machine is connected. If you have any tips or tricks please let me know :( Below is all the things I’ve tried

\-factory resetting machine 

\-taking myself and my machine directly next to the router

\-choosing the “set up new smart device using 2.4ghz” option on my internet providers app as the nespresso app states it must be 2.4ghz and not 5ghz

\-using a hotspot off someone else’s phone 

\-unplugging and plugging back in… several times 

\-using someone else’s phone/app to try

Hey everyone,

I wanted to share a productivity hack that's completely transformed how I handle contracts and legal paperwork. If your small business or side hustle still involves manually drafting NDAs, service agreements, or invoices, you're leaving serious time and money on the table.

I recently started using one of the newer AI document generation tools, and the results are honestly wild. Instead of trying to adapt old templates or paying a paralegal for basic stuff, the AI drafts a fully compliant, tailored legal document in less than 60 seconds.

**The biggest benefits I've seen:**

1.  **Speed is insane:** Need an NDA *right now* for a meeting? Done before your coffee cools.
2.  **Cost Savings:** These platforms are drastically cheaper than traditional services (think monthly costs in the single digits vs. triple digits).
3.  **Consistency:** Eliminates those ""oops, did I miss a clause?"" moments because the AI follows best practices.

It genuinely feels like having a legal intern available 24/7, but without the salary.

Has anyone else jumped on the AI document bandwagon yet? Which tools have you found most helpful for generating free or low-cost NDAs or contracts? I'm curious what everyone else is using!

P.S. If you're looking for a good starting point, the platform I use also has free, high-quality NDA and Contract generator tools available on their site if you want to try it out without commitment. Just search for ""Signova AI"" – their free generators alone are worth checking out.",0,1766704023.0,smallbusiness,4,0.2,False
