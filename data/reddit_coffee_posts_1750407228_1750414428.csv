I have a choice between robotics masters in iit and robotics msc in public universities abroad.
End goal: PhD in something similar then corporate.probably defense sectors or something like that.

I want to work for some time after my masters. My company had shitty work culture and I want to give the other side a shot. I would like to have the equivalent of 3lpm during this time(say living cost is 1lakh). I have issues with groupism and work place politics. I can deal with it but I think it hampers the output employees put out a lot.

I also find myself at odds with the things people prioritize. Like no one I know goes regularly to a gym but ever since college that has been a necessity,just for mental stability.same goes for coffee and stuff like that which i think costs insanely too much because in india only rich westernized people do it so it's all overpriced as hell.

Money is not much an issue but the lesser the load on parents the better, so part time job is a must. I already have the first years block settled.

So in terms of all these points, is Germany really a better option, like what are the nitty gritties that may change that?

(Placement after masters at iith could be anywhere between 15-40 lpa CTC(so the in hand could just be 1 lpm or even less). But Germany has a 42% tax cut on 60k+ salaries which would probably bring the end salary down 15-40 lpa only, even if the companies there lie less about CTCs)

When you arrive at campus you'll be quarantined (metaphorically under alleged campaign of ""No ragging"") as in minimal contact with senor and se√±oritas.

üåêFirst thing those in VS should do is get a LAN cable and ethernet to C-type or USB adapter (all the young dudes need internet access). KMS peeps will get their net from WiFi. (Suggestion only works if you already have a laptop...if not try to get one soon...especially if you are here for Placements)

üëïNext up pack for all seasons...Rourkela has all of the seasons in extremes (hot and cold). For winter, maybe bring them separately during Dussehra holidays. Bedsheets, Laundry bag, Tablecloth maybe drapes are accessories you should preferably bring. (Matresses and pillows will be sold for cheap around the campus on your arrival).

üå∏Toiletries...Well your choice...how much hygiene you want to maintain... :) But please have a deodorant to mask the scent if you don't prefer early morning bath...
Have a small mirror (will be handy).

üîêBring a lock for your room...bigger is better.

üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èBring your bicycle if you're nearby or buy one as soon as you get to campus (necessity...unless you are the Walker)

üò∑Now, definitely have a first aid kit with you, including some cetrizines, ors, bandage and antiseptic liquid. You can go to dispensary (but people usually go there to get leaves)

üßπBuy a broom right away. Have some Colin spray and rag clothes...definitely will come in handy. Buckets, mugs etc you'll get in the backpost market...

üòãHave a small 1k Watt water heater for Maggie, coffee etc...if you need. 
Bring some dry food, you wish to chow on...before moving on the the night and day canteen.

‚ö†Ô∏èFair bit of warning...Things above 1k Wattage (like Induction cookers, Hair dryers, Hair Curlers, Room heaters...etc) are technically not allowed and are sometimes busted in surprise checks (but no one cares about them...you might get an advance warning from the rumor mill).

1lg00ur,https://www.reddit.com/r/OveractiveBladder/comments/1lg00ur/help_please/,HELP please,"Everything's failed. Need helpful tips, secrets and solutions to EXTREMELY overactive bladder. 

53-year-old female, can't pinpoint when it started but decades ago but it's completely escalated out of control in to complete Insanity. Barely began getting medical help in The last 5 years.
Had FAILED sacral nerve wire surgery twice. Tried every meds scripts available, n Botox. Now doing needle in a haystack food log analogy/elimination and urine tracking. What happened to the good old diets the doctors would hand you to take home. Half a cup of baked chicken. 3 oz of plain yogurt. Half a cup of fresh green beans. Now all they tell you is try more fiber. And oats. These vegetables and things are good for you.. kale and quinoa. 
I cannot just put kale and quinoa on my plate and live off of that. There's no recipe, there's nothing telling me how to prepare it or to put spices so I taste a decent flavor, to eat it hot,,? eat it cold. It's just maddening. It is not specific in any way to give you a real structured idea of how to go about the eating foods that are non irritant for overactive bladder.

Currently suffering three and four nights in a row W ZERO sleep too often. Doing nothing but going from the toilet to my bed repeatedly for over 70+ hours no sleep. Absolutely insane. 

How can I live this way? I have eliminated so many things I'm visually noticing set it off. Yet out of the blue without eating any of them and continuing a very similar diet day to day will have one of these episodes with tens of hours of no sleep but tons of bathroom trips. 

I suffer from this on nearly a daily basis. There are a few days I actually do not need to go to the bathroom more than maybe 5 to 7 times in the day 

But typically it's at least 15 times from when I wake up and go to bed. My days are only 8 to 14 hours long. 

Some nights I will get up- up to 30 times to use the restroom before daylight. Going to bed after 9:00 p.m. bedtime is the most troublesome time. 

Daytime usually is maybe every hour and a half. But some days it could be every 20 minutes for most the day. 

Probably 85% of the time i urinate, stand up, turn on the water and wash my hands and immediately need to go urinate again. I could do this four or five times in sucession before I can leave the bathroom. Unheard of in my life before this issue. 

I've tried just using a wet towel to not hear the sound of the water. But the towel is still cold and maybe that's triggering. 

Now it seems It's evolved to where I don't even stand up and feel the pressure on my bladder again and have to sit on the toilet from 5 to 15 minutes most the time. Continuing to urinate in tiny spurts. Never ever ever have I been one of those people that can hold it... Go in the restroom and have this huge rush of urine released. 

No matter how long it had been since I last went or how much I have consumed it takes a considerable amount of time until after I have sat down to start to release my urine. It is a very slow stream, sometimes it goes on for 45 seconds or what seems forever but I am not ever able to release like other females I hear in public bathrooms. So completely jealous I don't have that ability to just get it all out at once and release everything completely in one visit to the restroom. 

I do not drink coffee have eliminated soda for the most part. I've eliminated tea. the second I drink tea I immediately have to urinate and probably for two days will pay the price. I absolutely love tea, hot tea, herbal teas, even tried teas that supposedly reduce overactive bladder, even decaffeinated tea still triggers the same result 
. 
Absolutely the same result. Me being on the toilet for 48 hours. 

If I get into bed and feel pressure, urine backed up, or bladder spasm I 100% know I am wasting my time laying there cuz I CANNOT fall asleep. I cannot fall asleep feeling that. I've tried sleeping sitting up, seems to not push weight onto my bladder. I've tried sleeping on the toilet very uncomfortable and seems impossible. I've tried sleeping in chairs, I've tried sleeping with my lower torso off the bed, on my knees so nothing is touching my groin and bladder area. Within 5 minutes my legs were numb. 

I've tried pamprin, muscle relaxers, ibuprofen. On occasion some help. But it's so inconsistent how the medication might work THAT DAY. I have even given myself way way more sleeping pills than advised or even thought I'd take in hopes I will just pass out n fall asleep from being over medicated and not even be conscious to know if I need to go to the restroom or not. I do not leak and I do not pee the bed. It just will feel intense pressure, pain and tight tight uncomfortable spasms which do not go away until I get up and urinate in the toilet

Oddly the heating pad seems to be very inconsistent. I've tried more than three. Honestly, whatever hot folded area I put against my skin every single time will cool off. I will touch the other side and it's very hot I turn it over I feel it very hot then it will go cold. I don't know if it's designed that way or every one I have is wonky but it's not doing what I expected it to do or how I thought it operates.

 I've tried topicals..icy hot, ben gay, salonpas. I don't know if they can't seep into the skin enough to calm the issue. Sometimes the sting or heat of it might begin to touch the surface of the problem but the biggest issue is next time I do get up and go to the bathroom it gets all over my legs and eventually into my vagina and then you got stinging. And have heat stinging down there that's a trigger to make you urinate. Last thing I need

The only thing I've come across that once again inconsistently helps is burning myself.. with a steaming hot towel. Placing a kitchen towel or hand towel in a plastic bag after it's been soaked in water. Microwave it For 90 seconds. Keeping it somewhat wet, Ziploc the bag, lay down and put it on my bladder / groin. The hotter it is the longer it'll last and you don't have to get up to warm it up again. 
If you barely make it warm it will be cold in minutes and you might as well just be going to the bathroom getting up that often. 

Yes, It absolutely burns my skin. I suffer from blisters when I use this method. But it is THE ONLY WAY that I can stop feeling the pressure and feeling my bladder knotted up and be able to relax to go to sleep. It's insane that I would go to these measures. I don't feel I have a choice. But when I apply that hot towel to my bladder I get that relief nearly immediately from the cramping, internal pain, pressure, muscle spasms

I tried putting trash bags on the bed with towels and just releasing in bed so I'm not getting up. I've worn diapers, I've worn depends just as trials but something about laying down, my body will not allow me to release urine. I have push and push and push until I see spots and get nervous that I may hemorrhage. Just to try to avoid not to go to the bathroom and have to get out of bed again 

Much earlier in life my uterus did hemorrhage so this is all so scary to me. 

I've ended up in those nights of frustration just rolling up the thickest towel I can find and putting it between my legs. At times I am able to release a tiny bit in bed laying down. Once again pushing with all my might sometimes three four five six seven times until I have no breath then taking the smallest breath I can and so that I can continue to squeeze at the same time and push hard and as long as I can hoping I start peeing before I have to breathe again. It's so insane 

It's starting to be a little more easier to try to push out urine in bed from practicing I suppose but now I'm starting to feel like 10 seconds later it wants me to do it again. Kind of like.. it can't get enough or okay it's my turn to be released and it's every couple minutes one after another. And I got to go through that extreme pushing and holding my breath in breathe in between pushes and it's just beyond crazy. 

I don't know what to do. I am just beyond frustrated and that doesn't even begin to describe how I'm feeling. 

I know I wrote a ton but I just want whoever is willing to read and reach out to realize I have tried so so many things. And if you've heard of any of these things or have resolved any of these things or tweaked them or have a story from someone you know that made things better I would be incredibly grateful to know and learn about it 

Please please send serious information that could help me. Yeah it can be a tiny bit funny between people you feel close to that you could tell things about 

But even my best friend / Aunt calls me pissy pants sometimes. And when you've had a bad day or haven't slept it's just not funny anymore. 

So I'm hoping to not get any kind of negative response like that. I am just a nice person trying to live my life suffering in so many ways from an overactive bladder and reaching out trying to connect with people that have information that clearly I do not. 

I hope that is what I find on here. Not ridicule or anything unhelpful and negative. 

Thank you for your time. I have heard great things about support groups and I'm really hoping this improves my life. 

I thank you for taking the time and gladly will share any experience or question or tips I may have to help you as well.

1lg00mc,https://www.reddit.com/r/analyzeme/comments/1lg00mc/your_intuition_is_a_survival_mechanism_what_i/,Your intuition is a survival mechanism: what I tell my own daughter,"For all young girls and women reading this: did you know that you are blessed with something called ""intuition""?

Intuition is, as you know, that *gut feeling* you get sometimes in certain situations that something does not feel right.

Did you know that you should never, ever ignore that intuition?

**Your intuition is something that you should always consider and take seriously**... because it is a *self-protection mechanism* that you have evolved over hundreds of thousands of years to ensure your survival.

I am a father of two adult children. One of my kids is a young woman in her mid-20s. We are very close and we talk about relationships and life on a pretty reglar basis.

My daughter often asks my advice about work situations and about the guys she meets. She might tell me a story about a date she has been on, and will tell me that during their conversation, the young man said something to her, or perhaps behaved in a way, that she was not expecting.

She will share with me that she was shocked by what he said... and then she will begin to wonder if he was right, and that perhaps there is something ""wrong"" with her.  She will begin to ***question her feelings*** about the situation.

I will inquire further: did his comment sound true? Did the behavior offend you? Did it lead you to believe that perhaps he was being dishonest or that maybe he was trying to maniupulate you into believing something that you knew was untrue?

My daughter will almost always tell me that yes, there was something about his comment that I knew was wrong, but then I thought: ""what if he's right, or what if my feelings are somehow wrong""?

A recent example:  my daughter went out on a first date.  She thought the guy was nice, and they had a good conversation, and he paid for the coffee.  As they were preparing to part ways, he abruptly moved toward her and tried to kiss her.

She told me she felt unprepared, because he was a complete stranger and she did not feel any emotional connection with him.

In fact, she told me, she felt disgusted by his behavior because it showed a lack of respect and no appreciation for HER feelings.  And of course she was right.

Yet she wondered, ever so slightly,  if perhaps there was something ""wrong"" with her for feeling that way.

I told her: ""feelings are never wrong, because they are feelings, and we cannot help those.""

Which brings me to something that I have observed on Reddit since signing up here a few months ago.

After reading thousands of posts here by young women, I am struck by a recurring theme: persistent self doubt about their own instincts, self-worth, sanity, and judgment, and a willingness to accept blame for the misdeeds and misbehavior of their abusive and inconsiderate male partners.

For example:

* a married woman with children who juggles all the household chores and child care recounts her husband's abusive, demeaning comments to her demanding sex every day, as though she is an inanimate object... and yet this woman wonders if his demands are unreasonable;
* a single woman, dating a young guy who brazenly cheats on her and refuses to talk about his behavior, wonders what it is that is wrong¬†*with her*¬†that would lead him to act in such a manner;
* still another woman has assumed the financial burden in a relationship with a man who refuses to search for work, and she asks whether it is *her fault* that he is lazy and neither motivated to seek employment nor to contribute to the household (even with chores, for example).

Many of these same women -- intelligent, thoughtful, and self-aware -- will, when asked, state that they are reluctant to leave the relationship because they are fearful they will not meet anyone else, or they believe that with time, their partner will somehow change -- even though there is not one shred of evidence to suggest that such change is even a remote possibility.

**Here is what I tell my own daughter: never, ever doubt or question the validity of what you feel, see, intuit and experience, especially when it comes to relationships with men. Trust your intuition, listen to your instincts.**

If something does not feel right to you, then 99.999% of the time, that's because it isn't. That little voice in your head is there for a reason: it is a self-protection mechanism, a survival tool that we have all developed over hundreds of thousand of years of evolution to guarantee our survival.

1lg00iv,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/1lg00iv/ama_how_i_reduced_my_screen_time_from_6_hours_to/,[AMA] How I Reduced My Screen Time from 6 Hours to 1 Hour with Simple Habits (Level 1),"Over the last four years, through daily practice, I‚Äôve built small, sustainable habits that helped me reduce my screen time from six hours to just one hour a day.

Based on my experience, quitting everything cold turkey rarely works for the long term. I either reverted to old patterns or swapped one app for another. Screen addiction is a deep-rooted habit built through years of daily use, so expecting to change it in a week or a month is unrealistic.

I deleted Facebook and never joined Instagram or Twitter, thinking this would ‚Äúsave‚Äù me, but I found myself spending just as much time on YouTube, LinkedIn, and Pinterest.

To break the cycle, my partner and I started with some basic rules that gradually became habits. I‚Äôve organized these habits into three levels. In this post, I‚Äôll share Level 1 - foundational habits that help you get the basics of mental and physical health on the right track

**Level 1: Foundational Habits**

1. **Separate Work, Chilling, and Sleep Spaces:** Keeping these areas distinct helped me do what the space is tasked for. And my after-work life stopped from collapsing into bed‚Äîeating, working, Netflix binges. Better posture with an ergonomic setup reduced my back pain and my energy level was better. Understand what function you want each space to foster, then design accordingly. Create barriers that make the behaviours you DON'T want inconvenient.
2. **Turn Off Non-Essential Notifications:** With fewer notifications, I found myself picking up my phone less often. Also whenever I picked up my phone, no notifications meant I didn't get distracted by an app.
3. **Keep Internet Off on Your Phone:** I keep my phone‚Äôs internet mostly off, especially during work hours. This reduces distractions from WhatsApp and takes away the pressure to reply instantly. I only turn it on for breaks or urgent needs.
4. **No Screens in the Bedroom:** We never bought a TV and made a rule against bringing laptops or phones into the bedroom. We use an analogue alarm clock and keep our phones in the living room. This meant we slept on time while talking or reading books. And books are the underrated sleeping pills.
5. **No Screens for the First 60 Minutes After Waking Up:** We use this time for chores, coffee, reading, journaling, or deep thinking work using pen and paper. These mornings are clearer and more energetic because our minds are well-rested and not flooded with information. We also started reading a physical newspaper.

These simple steps are actually how I lived my childhood, that is, before the internet. Obviously, I didn't start doing them all at once, but one after the other had become consistent. This didn't overwhelm me and helped me maintain consistency. These foundational habits gave me the strength to build Level 2 habits, which require more self-discipline and accountability. I‚Äôll share those in my next post.",1,1750413048.0,nosurf,1,1.0,False

This is mostly due to the fact that Slovene is not my native language but I do speak and understand well, just not in the perfect sense, like in types of slang etc.. I'd like to note that I come from an ex-yu country so I kind of understand why people might not mix due to the stereotypes portrayed, but I'd really like to have someone refer to as a genuine friend, and to also have a somewhat connection outside of classes. In my home country I am used to often going with friends for a coffee or drinks, of course I don't expect the same since I am quite busy with uni, and I'm not sure if that culture is present here that much.

i first found them at the end of summer of 2023. only by my windows, sometimes on the curtains or on the windowsills themselves. they were identified by my ex who studied entomology, he told me basically the same thing most people say on here: frequent vaccuming/ cleaning will keep them at bay, a few here and there are nothing to be ashamed or panicked about, as long as i do what i can to manage them they will be no problem. however! my main source of the issue and my anxiety is the fact that i am autistic and have a special interest and find a lot of comfort in soft things/ plushies/ blankets‚Ä¶ anything they are attracted to live on basically (not to really eat but like. live ON). i started to find them on some of my stuffed animals and fully broke down. i have 200+ plushies that i have had in bags since i first found them. this took a huge toll on my mental health. a lot of my collectible plush are not machine washable so i‚Äôve had to just throw a lot of them away. the stress of JUST this aspect has made me so obsessively afraid to find them or see them- i can be sent into a meltdown from finding one. i also have troubles with ‚Äúcontamination‚Äù and worry that even if i get them off of the surface of my plushies they still live inside them or microscopically leave eggs,,,? is this possible? is it possible for them to be INSIDE a completely closed stuffed animal? i don‚Äôt see much Damage to them besides the remnants that removing larvae can often leave but still fear that even that can attract more or that they will potentially put my other collection pieces at risk :‚Äô)

my next issue,, i have seen that they are drawn to organic matter like pet hair, or things found in dust. they‚Äôre also attracted to warm places like windowsills and curtains. that they also thrive under unmoved heavy furniture. now this is rough because i have an almost immovable wooden bed frame and head board that are directly next to my window (an exterior wall). my options are extremely limited; i cannot move my bed frame any more than a few inches to clean underneath because it has attached drawers underneath. i cannot get a new bed because the family members i live with do not want to split the expensive set of heavy furniture up. my mattress is memory foam that has an entirely fuzzy covering almost like a blanket. does this mean they could be living ON my mattress from coming up through the drawers? could my mattress possibly be the Source of these or where they live, even if they‚Äôre not eating it because it‚Äôs inorganic material? should i try to start vaccuming my mattress? :‚Äô))) i‚Äôve slowly started cleaning everything out of the drawers (mostly old clothes) and have definitely found a couple. i also have 4 dogs so pet hair accumulation is inevitable and not really able to be kept away for long even if im vaccuming every few days when i can. are there ANY other solutions anyone can offer? any way to prevent them showing up on my bed at least? i can live with keeping my valued plushies packed up for a while longer, i can live with one here and there around the carpet but :‚Äô) it has put me in the biggest dilemma. i have been dreading sleeping in my own bed because i find them on pillows even though i only keep three of them in my bed now. i shake out my blankets every few hours because i‚Äôm afraid they accumulate in the day when im at work or not in my bed. i almost ONLY ever see them at night, and almost ONLY two or three at a time every few nights or maybe every other night at this point. is this considered an extreme infestation? ive seen maybe one or two outside of my bed/ bed frame/ window area (not counting my plush collection items,,) in the entire year and a half i‚Äôve been aware of them. so they‚Äôre not really spreading which is good, but they‚Äôre just in the MOST dreadful spot imaginable for me.

i‚Äôve seen some contradicting things like they arent attracted to humans in any capacity, but i also read that they eat at oils in your hair and are inclined to get into it? :‚Äô) or into clothes While you wear them? i work as a barista so come home sometimes with syrup or coffee grind on me and am terrified to think they are attracted to it even under my clothes. or that more can get into my blankets because of stuff on my skin. (i try to wash them every chance i get which is every couple weeks usually, so it‚Äôs not like it would be ON the blankets really. im concerned about them being attracted to it WHILE it‚Äôs touching me.) i don‚Äôt know how true any of it is but i am in extreme distress.

 i‚Äôve been on my phone at night in bed only to see one on my pillow or even once crawled onto my hand without noticing and then across my phone. it sent me into a two day long episode and i have been extremely paranoid since then, not being able to lie in bed at night for more that maybe 30 minutes before having to shine a flashlight on every pillow surface to make sure there are none. (after the initial check before getting in bed, more almost never show up, but im still afraid of one being that close to my face again.) i don‚Äôt believe i‚Äôve found the source of them but i fear because im almost completely unable to get BEHIND my bed or under my headboard there will be much more than i thought. i am scared of every itch i feel. i am afraid to put on my clothes because im worried they will be in there. i find no comfort anymore in things that are my only sense of safety and joy because im afraid they‚Äôll be ruined or infested or that they will make the problem worse. i cry almost every night because i miss sleeping with more than one or two stuffed animals in my bed every night. how do i comfortably sleep with blankets on my bed when i am terrified they have one hiding somewhere. 

i also am afraid that i am the reason it has gotten to this and my mental health is part of why. i have bipolar depression and find it hard to deep clean on a daily or even weekly basis. sometimes i‚Äôll keep up with it for a few weeks and then won‚Äôt see them almost at all, but then the second i fall behind or have a hard few days, it‚Äôs back to finding 2 or 3 around my pillows every other night when i get home. i just went through and cleaned a lot of my bedding and pillow cases about a week ago and i was so happy not seeing them at ALL for the entire last week. but then i got home tonight from work and i found one on two pillows and am back to feeling entirely hopeless and spiraling. i know they are extremely common in households but i feel like people will see me as dirty and it has been effecting my mental health for over a year now. i don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. i also recently got a few glue traps that work for insects just to see if they‚Äôre coming from where i believe they are, i put one behind my pillows in my headboard and one on the side of my bed that is almost touching the wall with my window. both of them have been there for 3 days now and not a single beetle has been on either, even after seeing the two on my pillows. i don‚Äôt know what more i can do. :‚Äô) can anyone offer a solution that is slight more effective in longevity besides vaccuming or washing my sheets? i do not have the mental strength to do either on a daily basis, and vaccuming i am usually ok doing once or twice a week but i don‚Äôt really have time, money, or energy to wash my sheets more than every few weeks. 

i am so scared of not doing enough but my mental health can be physically debilitating at it‚Äôs worst and im doing my best to stay on top of it but i just take two steps forward and then two steps back. i feel like im gross for not being able to clean as often and as well as other people on this sub due to my immovable furniture and refusal from my family to let me get something else. as obsessive as i can be about trying to control them, the fatigue from the sadness and stress they cause when i don‚Äôt feel like im making much progress sets me back and i start all over. :(

___
TLDR: Questions i have,

- are there any more long lasting or long term solutions besides cleaning? my mental health cannot always handle it, and they always show up again (in small numbers like 2-3) after a week or so. 

- is finding 2-3 every other day in the same areas but almost nowhere else indicating an infestation? is it extreme to see them in a busy area like my bed; or have they become excessively comfortable because there‚Äôs more than i think? how often is it okay to see them before i know it is more than the average household? am i dirty or not doing enough if i see them this much? :‚Äô)

- i‚Äôve seen some contradicting things like they arent attracted to humans in any capacity, but also that they eat at oils in your hair and are inclined to get into it? or into clothes While you wear them? is this true? :‚Äô) can me using my blankets attract them to Me? im very scared of seeing them ON me specifically, because i never find them in unworn clothing, just a few times crawling On it from being somewhere they usually stay at (on my shirt while im in my bed, falling onto my clothes while im cleaning, stuff like that).

- i worry that even if i get them off of the surface of my plushies they still live inside them or microscopically leave eggs,,,? is this possible? is it possible for them to be INSIDE a completely closed stuffed animal? i don‚Äôt see much Damage to them besides the remnants that removing larvae can sometimes leave but still fear that even that can attract more or that they will potentially put my other collection pieces at risk even after being surface cleaned and nothing visible on them.

- my mattress is memory foam that has an entirely fuzzy covering almost like a blanket. does this mean they could be living ON my mattress from coming up through the drawers attached to my bed frame? could my mattress possibly be the Source of these or where they live, even if they‚Äôre not eating it because it‚Äôs inorganic material? should i try to start vaccuming my mattress when i wash my bedding? :‚Äô)

- any way to prevent them showing up on my bed at least? do any smells or Things make them stay away from a certain area? knowing they are in the house isn‚Äôt too bad, but them mainly around my bed has been the direct source of my stress for Months. i haven‚Äôt had proper sleep this entire time. waking up anxious after 4-5 hours and constantly feeling dirty even though i try really hard not to be.

- any advice to generally just be less anxious about these beetles? :‚Äô) bugs have always freaked me out a little but i feel disgusting about myself, i am so scared to have people in my bed to sleep over out of fear they will have to deal with them. i can‚Äôt have my comfort items or comforting textures that previously have been the only things able to calm me. my biggest interest has been put indefinitely on hold out of fear that i will immediately have to get rid of them. im scared to get in my bed at night and im scared to sleep. 

please feel free to leave anything you‚Äôd think would be helpful. thank you for taking the time to read any of this. i hope i do not sound crazy, but i feel like they‚Äôre making me crazy at this point. ",1,1750412504.0,carpetbeetles,1,1.0,False

I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

Hey, fellow RetirementReady warriors! üéâ

So, let‚Äôs get real for a second. You ever wake up in the morning and feel like you‚Äôre playing a game of ‚ÄúIs that a creak in my joints or the floorboards‚Äù? üôà Yeah, me too. After turning 50, I realized my ability to bend down and pick up a penny (let alone anything heavier) became a Herculean task. But guess what? I found a way to fix that *without popping pills or living in constant pain*. 

We believe in meaningful results, right? Well, here's how I made my joints feel like they‚Äôre 20 again!

Here are a few simple changes that worked wonders for me:

- **Stretched Like a Cat**: Seriously, have you ever seen a cat stretch? They know what they're doing! I started incorporating stretching into my daily routine. Just a few gentle stretches in the morning helped me feel like Mario after collecting a power-up. It also signaled to my body, ‚ÄúHey, we‚Äôre alive and moving today!‚Äù

- **Embraced Movement**: Instead of looking at exercise like a chore, I found ways to make it fun. Dancing around the living room to my favorite tunes? üíÉ Count me in! Even a brisk walk around the neighborhood did wonders. It‚Äôs amazing how something as simple as walking can keep the joints happy.

- **Hydration Station**: Let's not forget about water, my friends! I upped my hydration game. I mean, did you know your joints need lubrication? Think of it like giving them a nice oil change. Who doesn‚Äôt love that? Plus, staying well-hydrated gives you energy and boosts your mood! Win-win!

- **Found My Go-To Yoga Videos**: I stumbled upon this amazing treasure trove of yoga tutorials online. I‚Äôm talking about those slow-moving, gentle flows that felt like a warm hug for my joints. üöÄ There‚Äôs something about flowing through those poses that made my body sing! 

- **Squats Are Your Friend**: Now, before you roll your eyes imagining a Reddit fitness bro yelling at you to do 100 squats, hear me out. I started doing **bodyweight squats**. And guess what? They‚Äôre not just for gym rats! They help strengthen your legs and improve your mobility over time. Plus, you can do them while waiting for your coffee to brew! üòÇ

- **Listen to My Body**: I learned to pay attention to what my body is telling me. Some days, things felt tight and I needed to back off. Other days, I could push a little more. It was all about finding that groove‚Äîlike when you finally hit the right note in karaoke! üé§ 

I never thought I could find relief without pills or pain, but here we are. It's all about small changes that stick. My joints feel grateful, which is a pretty good feeling! 

How about you? Do you have any tips or secrets for keeping those joints happy? Share your wisdom! Let‚Äôs keep unlocking our potential! üôå",1,1750411804.0,RetirementReady,0,1.0,False

Sitting in a Coffee Shop

I‚Äôm sitting in a coffee shopwhere the music playing doesn‚Äôt match my grief.Around me, people laugh, type, sipwhile the person I love is being unmade and remadeat this very moment.

I sip my tea slowly,begging my body to keep it down.But all I can think about is younaked, anesthetized,lying on a cold steel table under bright surgical lights.The cautery machine hums.Some chosen soundtrack plays over the violence.

She‚Äôs prepped her field.Marked your skin with purple inkthe same skin I once traced quietly with my fingers in the dark. 
They‚Äôve bathed you in chlorhexidine.Draped you in sterile blue clothsInjected lidocaine with epinephrineto control bleedingbut there is no sympathomimetic agentfor this kind of loss.

Scalpel to skin.Precise. Controlled.Violent in its mercy.

They cut through your dermis,subcutaneous fat, adiposethe soft places I once held,where I rested my cheek and felt safefor the first time in my life.Where I listened to the steady beat of your heart.Tissue I memorized.Tissue that held my fear like it understood it.It held me.

They dissect through Cooper‚Äôs ligaments,separate glandular tissue from pectoralis fascia,removing breast tissue like an unwanted growth.But it wasn‚Äôt unwanted by me.It was sanctuary.It was home.

Carefully, they resect you, piece by piece.Excising what was never pathology.
The electrocautery hums, burning vessels closed.
The smell of you, burning.My safe place, cauterized.Smoke rises into sterile air from flesh I once kissed.Suction pulls away your blood,and I imagine crimson spiraling through tubing,pooling in canisterswhile I sit here among strangers.Your blood.My grief.

Your nipples are being removed nowsharply excised, resized with circular dermal punches.Blades carve what once responded to my touch.Nerves severed, detached from sensation.Repositioned as free grafts,stitched into a geography that will never feel me again.My lips, my fingers,my love.

Secured with bolsters,waiting for neovascularization.Waiting for blood to find its way backbut my touch never will.

They weigh the tissue.Document it.Discard it as medical waste.Into red bags, to be incinerated.Like it never held meaning.Like it never held the version of you I first fell into.

They are closing you in layers.Skin approximated.Absorbable sutures beneath the surface.Dermabond above.Nothing will penetrate this space.

Drains are placed like foreign veinsto collect fluid your body doesn‚Äôt know how to reabsorb.Your immune system will respond,as it always does to trauma.It can‚Äôt distinguish thisand neither can I.

Bruising will bloombeautiful violets of purple across your ribcage.Swelling will rise.Pain will settle deep,into muscle, into bone.Healing begins now.

Even as I sit here,tracing the anatomy of my grief in surgical terms.Imagining the precisionof this desecration.Waiting for the phone to ring,to tell me you‚Äôre okay.

This is gender-affirming surgery.This is life-saving surgery.I want this for you.I want you to feel whole.

But my body registers itas amputation.As loss.It cannot distinguish your liberationfrom my rupture.It confuses me.It shames me.Chokes me.

I am proud of you.I love you for surviving long enoughto choose this.To become who you‚Äôve always been.To fight for your own skin.

But my own skin tightens.Trembles.Mistakes your freedom for my grief.And I hate that.That my nervous system can‚Äôt tell the difference.That it feels like holy groundis being ripped awaywhile I sip a drink I cannot taste.For the love of GodI cannot taste it.

I am not angry.I am not hurt.I am just inside out.Cut open, like you.Only I won‚Äôt have suturesto hold me together.I will bleed freely.

I will meet you where you are.Even as I mourn what is gone.Even as I shake with griefI cannot explain without shame.Even as I love you fiercely, completely,and ache for the part of you I lostthe part that helped me survivemy own history.
I will learn your new body.Trace new scars like constellations.I will learn how to touch you again

***Forbidden love or a second chance?***

My name is Jon and I‚Äôm an Englishman living in Lanzarote in the Canary Islands. I‚Äôm thirty-six and divorced, although I‚Äôd rather not talk about that. I‚Äôve lived on the island for eight years, I speak Spanish, and I have enough work to put a roof over my head. Life‚Äôs not great, but it‚Äôll do.

Then one morning, I‚Äôm having coffee at my usual beachfront caf√©, when in walks a young woman who sits at my table, takes off her sunglasses and says, ‚ÄòHi!‚Äô Her name is Clara and two years earlier she was here on holiday with her family ‚Ä¶ and apparently I did something that impressed her. Now she‚Äôs back, a young woman of eighteen, and she wants a holiday fling with, as she puts it: ‚ÄòA man who knows how to be a man.‚Äô

To be honest, I‚Äôm torn. Clara is beautiful and smart and naturally I want her. But I‚Äôm also twice her age. Isn‚Äôt it wrong for me to do this? But then, as my friend Bruno says, she is only here for a week. If I treat her well and give her a great ‚Äòholiday adventure‚Äô, what have I done wrong?

I mean ‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre not going to fall in love, are we?

Val sighed, leaning back on the bench they found themselves on and stuck their hand in their white leather jeans, their somewhat long, messy hair covering one of their eyes. Fortunately, there was a park near where they paused their search efforts, and the steady stream in front of them beyond the pathway was a great background noise for their thoughts to collect themselves. But the more they thought about today‚Äôs events, the less they made sense, and the more the background noise of the park invaded their mind and interrupted their thoughts.

As the tall, muscular Mr. Blue saw Val, he quickly approached the youth, making Val realize just how much bigger he was compared to them.

‚ÄúNot sure what a Pollyanic is, but all that matters is that it‚Äôs a title you got, so I‚Äôm gonna take it from ya! *Oh yeah*!‚Äù

Val paused once again, now thoroughly confused. Was this guy seriously just after their title named after their personality? That‚Äôs not even how their titles worked!

We were friends before dating, and he supported me through a breakup with a guy who constantly lied, manipulated, and cheated on his exes and expressed disgust and kept close so when the relationship ended, he could shoot his shot, and then ended up lying about and doing the same. 

  
To provide some context first, I will then get into what happened. My now ex, let's call him M, and I met last September through his group of friends at a pool in the city I live in. M lives close but in a different country. I was in an LDR which was serious with E We met and got along, but I told him I was taken pretty quickly, and we just stayed friends. In November of last year, when I was staying with E in his country, I caught him lying to me. He had told me he was completely single in the month before we became official, while we planned travel, talked about partnership and futures, sexted, etc., and he turned out to be with someone the whole time. I had expressed to him my main fear was around infidelity because of the long distance, and he would always claim he had never cheated, and I found out he had cheated on almost every girlfriend he had - sometimes fully, sometimes just through asking for nudes. He admitted to love bombing me for the first months of our relationship to keep me hooked, and had a pattern of manipulation. It took me months after our relationship ended to finally admit the first time we had sex was rape (I told him I didn't want to have sex before sleeping, woke up to him having sex with me aggressively and calling me a bitch, I stopped him and when I tried to say why he told me to shut up) we talked it out and it never happened again but sexual and emotional pushiness was a theme. By December, we were over but were waiting to see each other in person to officially decide, but I was done, and E knew that and was trying to convince me to fix things. 



In December, M started getting a lot closer to me, at first as a friend to support me while I went through the breakup, but it was very quick that we developed feelings for each other and would talk almost every day, all day, with regular hour-long phone calls. M knew about everything with E and constantly said how much he hated guys who juggled women, lied, cheated, and he couldn't understand how a guy could do that to a woman, especially one like me. 

I asked M in December while we were getting closer if he was seeing anyone or sleeping with anyone and he explicitly said no - he said he's been single for 2 years focusing on himself to get ready for a more serious relationship that could lead to building a family, that he had a friends with benefits but that they would only see each other or talk once every couple of weeks and meet up for sex but that there was an understanding that if either of them found someone they'd stop and there was no feelings involved, and that he hadn't met up with them since October when he and I started talking more often. 

  
I went to visit M on December 19 and stayed with him until the 27th. The emotional and physical chemistry was really strong, and M was very clear he was interested in me and nurturing the possibility to be together when I felt ready and made my final decision with E. On the last two nights, we hugged, and he played with my hair, we talked and he told me he had loved me since we met, but was backing off because of my relationship, and he wanted seriousness with me, but didn't want to cause me more stress with everything going on. I told him I felt the chemistry but still hadn't closed things with E and wasn't ok starting something for everyone's sakes, but that I was pretty certain it was over, ""I don't want to invite you into my heart if it still smells like someone else"". So we agreed to wait to explore our connection until I had ended things with E and had some time to recover. 

  
I went back home, and E came for the talk. He stayed 2 weeks, and we talked, and the relationship ended right when he left. M came to the city during E's visit for work, and I saw him a lot, he met my whole family, told me he was in love with me, and if I'm being honest looking back now in December we were functionally in a relationship but just holding it back until I finished. I asked him again during this period about any other relationships in his life, and he said the same as the first time. He mentioned he's still friends with exes, but on really clear and good terms. 

After my relationship ended, we got close fast; he would come visit at least once a month, or I would go to him. He came to me in January, I visited him and stayed in his house alone when we went for a business conference in February, and he came to me in March and we spent 4 days of the trip staying together at my parents' house before he travelled to New York to see his family. During my visit in February, he complained to me one day about a girl he knew who was in a toxic relationship and would call him screaming and crying to vent and how he didn't respect her for not leaving and that he couldn't help her. During his visit in March, E got back in touch with me, begging for us to try again and proclaiming he hadn't been with anyone and was waiting for a change with me. I told M, we even sat in bed and talked about it which opened a conversation of how we would each handle it if we thought of cheating or lying, he said "" I would come to you and tell you how I was feeling so we could talk about it, I would never sacrifice my love and potential children for fleeting lust"" then he went on to talk about how important it is to him and how good he is at controlling desire. 

  
When M went to New York, I travelled to Italy for my Master's, and we planned that he would come visit me in May and June, then we would travel to Eastern Europe together. The night before we both left, we had a date to sit down and talk about how we wanted to handle boundaries, etc., during the time away, and he was 4 hours late from ""coffee with his cousin,"" and we never talked. I got upset, and he promised he would send me a long message when he got to New York (he eventually did, 2 weeks later, after I asked about it). While in New York, his messages got colder, and our communication changed, but went back to normal and then happened again in May. One day in May he called me and told me an ex contacted him out of the blue with an ""exit survey"" asking him to answer some questions on why they didn't work and how he thinks she could improve and asking me what I think he should do, I told him to just give her the closure shes looking for. 

  
Fast forward to this month, he came to Italy, got there on May 27. Everything was going well, and we were preparing to travel, and one night we got into an argument, and his reactions to me were really unusual. That night I was spiralling about my Ex and trying to remember what was going on between M and me and the time. He gave me his passcode and told me I can go on his phone whenever, so I went on Instagram (I had deactivated mine since Dec and couldn't get it back - and it's where we talked Nov-Dec), so I could read our messages. When I got to my chat, I noticed one right above it for a woman we'll call R., I opened it and read. I also saw like 6/7 Eastern European women he met on his trips that he would constantly react to stories of and try to keep up conversations, most of whom wouldn't respond except for one, O, but I didn't read everything, but saw they talked until about February. 

I confronted him and for the next week we were stuck in this kind of hellscape of me finding out about more lies, him defending himself, gaslighting me, us fighting until eventually I asked to see proof of what he was saying and it would prove he was lying and it turned into a vicious cycle. Here's everything I found out. 

R and he were affair partners of two years, he cheated on his Ex, N, for 5 months with R after picking her up at a car dealership. R was in a relationship the entire time, and they had agreed to lie for each other if either person's current or future partners found out about them. He loved her, would buy her expensive jewelry, stay on the phone for hours every day, and had a saved folder of photos she would send him to jerk off to. They were still seeing each other the entire time he and I knew each other, and she was sleeping over, and they were texting all day every day throughout December. It cooled down when I was in the city, but never stopped. He didn't sit her down and say they had to stop until mid-January, and never stopped talking to her, just stopped meeting up for sex; she's the woman he complained to me about in February. The ex he cheated on her with, N, is who he was with most of the time in New York, and they didn't hook up (she's fairly religious and doesn't do much physically if not in a relationship) but he had been leading her on with false hope since their breakup for 2 years. 

When I read the messages between him and N (with his permission and him sitting next to me) after New York I saw her asking him if there was hope for them after what happened and he said they could only be friends, she asked if there was someone in his life and that if there was it would help her move on and he said no but he only saw her as a friend - this was in May a week before he came to me. I told him he owed her to truth and an apology, he asked for my help drafting a message and I helped him and he just copied and pasted what I wrote and didn't put it in his own words.. she eventually reached out me and her and I talked and I found out he lied to me about everything about their relationship (he said they never did more than kiss, when actually they did everything but full sex). 

I found out that all the Eastern European girls he would chase after? He would screenshot and save the stories he was reacting to and jerk off to them. 2 of the women he knew and did this with, he invited to spend time in Eastern Europe on our trip without mentioning me to them or them to me. One of the women, O, who was introduced to as a ""potential wife"" by the others in October, saved her photos in November and after I confronted him the first day he deleted all his WhatsApp and insta chats with her and non one else, so I couldn't see them. He would screenshot photos of friends of his on Instagram that he talks to and sees regularly for the same reason. I found out he was still jerking off to pictures of R while we were formally in a relationship (he claims it was only once, I think that's bullshit) after he spent months asking me for photos and telling me he was so satisfied and turned on by me he wasn't even watching porn anymore. 

I could keep going, but this is getting really long, and I think it gets the point across. He lied to me, about almost everything. For 10 days he stayed at my house while we fought and talked about it and the truth came out slowly over the 10 days, not because he told me, but because I looked deeper. 4 days ago when he finally admitted to the cheating on N, I told him to pack his shit and go. He did, and we had a really emotional goodbye and he told me he would stay close by until my travel date in case I was open to talk and give him a chance to re-earn my trust. That night, I had a moment of vulnerability and reached out and he told me he went to another city 3 hours away and we agreed to have a call. The next day, N reached out me and we talked all day. She told me everything, and her and I have actually become friends, I told her about R and she said thank you so much, I always knew but never found out the truth for sure.   


Anways, on Wednesday we sat down for a closure conversation and were calm and it went well. During the last couple hours we were sitting in the park talking and R started calling him. I told him to answer it and he said he would wait till he got home so I said can I answer it and he said yes. I stayed very calm and respectful, I just introduced myself, told her I'm the woman he was with in December and January and that I've learned about everything from that time and before it, that I just wanted her to know the woman that he was with while they were still cheating with each other and told her to talk to him and gave him the phone. She started screaming, calling me a whore, saying he was letting some woman get involved in his past and control him and telling him to be a man, physically threatening me, screaming and crying that he sold her out - loosing her fucking mind. And he was soft, gentle, patient with her, honest, when she would cuss me out he would just say ""I love this woman, she was going to be my wife and I lost her because of us"" and when she would say we didn't do anything he would say ""R, shes seen everything, she knows everything"". Didn't put her in her place once and let her continue cussing me out.   


He sent her two voice notes and then blocked her - based on my recommendation but during the call while she was screaming, I remember hearing him say, just wait a couple weeks until I'm back and we can sit down and have a conversation calmly in person and you can come over.   


I ended things. He asked if he could get in touch in the future I said he could send an email but I was unsure if I would want to answer and we went our own ways. I already know he's telling a version of the story that makes me look like I'm over reacting over little things and he's being very understanding and accountable. I want to know - did I over react? Was it wrong to answer his phone to R? ",3,1750411279.0,AIO,1,1.0,False

# The Victorian SEO Crisis: Why You're Paying a Premium to Lose

As a business owner in Victoria, you operate in Australia's most competitive and sophisticated market. You're driven, innovative, and world-class. You might be a leading tech firm in the Cremorne ""Silicon Yarra"" precinct, a high-end professional services firm on Collins Street, a major manufacturing business in Dandenong, or a renowned tourism operator on the Great Ocean Road. Yet despite your excellence, a huge, invisible force is actively working against your online success: a broken, inefficient, and outrageously expensive SEO market.

The Australian digital landscape is heavily dominated by a handful of agencies in Sydney and Melbourne that cater to the ASX 200. This leaves Victorian SMEs with a terrible choice: pay a ""Melbourne premium"" to an agency that uses outdated, manual methods, or try to do it yourself and get completely swamped. Both paths lead to the same destination: wasted money and missed opportunities. The foundation of digital growth, building high-quality backlinks, is where this crisis is most severe. Backlinks are the 'votes of trust' that Google uses to rank websites, but the traditional way of getting them is a slow, manual ""grind"" that is rigged in favour of those with the biggest budgets.

For an ambitious business in Geelong, a family-owned winery in the Yarra Valley, or a growing B2B company in the Melbourne CBD, the old system is a recipe for stagnation. The only way to win is to change the game with technology like¬†[ai automatik link building](https://aimonstertools.com/ai-linkbuilding-tool/).

# The Flawed SEO Playbook for Victorian Businesses

If you've ever tried to improve your Google rankings with an¬†[SEO agency in Melbourne](https://aimonstertools.com/ai-linkbuilding-service/), this expensive and frustrating story will be all too familiar:

* **The ""Collins Street Agency"" Problem:**¬†You sign a costly contract with a slick agency with a fancy address. They charge an eye-watering monthly retainer, and their ""strategy"" consists of writing a few blog posts and getting you some links from generic Australian websites that have zero authority or relevance in Victoria. They don't understand your specific industry or what your customers are actually looking for. You are paying for a brand name, not for results.
* **The Impossible Manual ""Grind"":**¬†You decide to try building links yourself to save money. You or your team spend hundreds of valuable hours searching for Victorian blogs, news sites, and industry portals. The good ones are inundated with requests from around the world. Your polite, well-written emails simply get lost in the noise. The return on your time investment is devastatingly low.
* **The ""Guest Posting"" Time-Waster:**¬†You're told the secret is to write ""thought leadership"" articles for other websites. You invest days of your time and intellectual property into crafting a brilliant piece, only for it to be rejected or published on a tiny, irrelevant blog with no readership. You are essentially working for free, building content for others with no tangible benefit for your own business. This is not a viable strategy for¬†[SEO in Victoria](https://aimonstertools.com/ai-linkbuilding-tool/).
* **Drowned Out by the Big Fish:**¬†The Australian digital space is dominated by national giants in banking, retail, and services. They have massive, established backlink profiles built over years. Competing with their existing authority through manual link building is like trying to build a new Eureka Tower with a handful of bricks. It feels impossible to catch up.

This outdated model is a dead end. It is inefficient, unpredictable, and financially unsustainable for most Victorian businesses. It creates a digital ecosystem where Victorian companies are at a permanent disadvantage. But what if you could use technology to turn this situation into your greatest strength? What if you could use AI to completely bypass this broken system and use \*\*automatic link insertion\*\* to place your links directly into high-authority online articles that your target customers across Australia are already reading?

>""We run a specialised financial technology firm in Melbourne's CBD. We were paying a top-tier agency over $10,000 a month for SEO. The results were pathetic. It was all reports and no real impact. We needed a disruptive technology that could deliver real authority, not just billable hours. We needed AI MONSTER TOOL.""

# The Technological ""Hook Turn"": AI Automatic Link Insertion by AI MONSTER TOOL

It's time for a fundamental shift in your digital strategy. Stop thinking about ""building"" links. That is the old, slow way. The new, intelligent way is to \*insert\* them with surgical precision. This is the revolution of \*\*AI-powered automatic link insertion\*\*, a groundbreaking technology that is levelling the playing field for businesses everywhere, especially in a competitive market like Victoria. AI MONSTER TOOL is the undisputed leader in this new frontier.

The old strategy is like trying to get a new, unknown coffee cart a good spot on Degraves Street. It's difficult, competitive, and you have to hope people notice you. Our new strategy is like having a master key that lets you find the perfect empty spot in a major national publication and place your brand there instantly. Our advanced AI scans the web to find popular, high-authority articles already trusted by Google. Then, it identifies the perfect, contextually relevant ""gap"" within that article to insert a link to your website. This is what our¬†[automated link insertion](https://aimonstertools.com/ai-linkbuilding-tool/)¬†software does for your business online, giving you immediate exposure to a high-value, existing audience.

# How AI Automatic Link Insertion Gives You a Decisive Advantage in Victoria:

* **Step 1: Deep Semantic Analysis of Australian & Victorian Content:**¬†Our AI reads and understands millions of articles from Australian news sites (like The Age, The Herald Sun), popular blogs, industry journals, and government sites. It uses advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand the precise topic and context of every page, with a special focus on content relevant to Victoria's key sectors.
* **Step 2: Identifying High-Value ""Link Gaps"":**¬†The AI finds specific sentences within this high-authority content where a link to your website would be a natural, helpful addition for the reader. For example, it might find a national travel article about the Great Ocean Road that doesn't link to a specific accommodation provider in Lorne or Apollo Bay. If you are that provider, our AI finds that priceless opportunity. This is not just link building; this is intelligent \*\*link insertion from AI MONSTER TOOL\*\*.
* **Step 3: Uncovering ""Lost"" Victorian-Related Mentions:**¬†Our system constantly scans the web for mentions of your company name, your projects, or your key people that are not linked. These are the easiest, most powerful links you can get. The AI finds these ""unlinked brand mentions"" on sites across Australia and prepares them for automated link acquisition, instantly connecting your business to existing conversations about your region and industry.
* **Step 4: Automated, Scalable, and Precise Placement:**¬†This is the core innovation of AI MONSTER TOOL. Using a network of publisher partnerships and advanced API communications, our software automates the process of securing the link insertion within the identified ""link gap."" This happens at a scale and speed that no human team or traditional agency could ever achieve. This is the pinnacle of¬†[ai automatik link building](https://aimonstertools.com/ai-linkbuilding-tool/)¬†technology.

Imagine the power of this. Every month, a steady stream of new, powerful, contextual links pointing to your website from articles that Google already trusts and ranks highly, all reinforcing your expertise in Victoria. The impact on your search engine rankings, your brand visibility, and your ability to win new customers from Melbourne to Mildura and beyond is transformative. This isn't a future promise; it's the reality AI MONSTER TOOL delivers to Victorian businesses today.

The faint smell of stale coffee fills the dark hallways of a building full of hope and sorrow. 

I follow the scent down the hallway to see an elderly man, holding the hand of his wife as they are being told his cancer has come back for the second time. 

The scent is getting stronger and there‚Äôs a family, crying as they begin to mourn their loved one, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just too soon.‚Äù, I hear the younger woman say. 

I finally reach the coffee machine to be standing by a nurse, staring at her cup filling, hoping whatever is in it will make the hours pass faster. 

She gives me the kindest smile as she walks away. 

I fill two cups, one with two sugar and one black. I walk slowly back to towards the exit, the soft cries of the family dissipate.

The doors open, and there my mother sits in her wheelchair, patiently waiting for me to take her home.

in the last few months i‚Äôve been really struggling. just a lot more than usual, i‚Äôm not diagnosed but my therapist suspects im bipolar since my dad and other family members are, i just can‚Äôt afford to go see a psychiatrist right now and get diagnosed. ik i‚Äôm in some sort of episode and itll pass but it just feels like this is gonna be forever right now.

my mums been fighting with me a lot, and that‚Äôs just making it a lot worse.

i‚Äôm so exhausted and miserable and it just won‚Äôt go away. i wake up with zero energy and usually i can‚Äôt get out of bed for like four hours. i don‚Äôt know what to do about it, i‚Äôm trying everything i can and nothing is working. i‚Äôm eating healthy, i stopped drinking coffee and alcohol, i‚Äôve stopped smoking, and it just feels like i‚Äôm getting more and more exhausted the more i try to get healthy.

the only time i feel like i have any energy at all is if i‚Äôm hanging out with my sister. but she‚Äôs busy a lot. i dunno why but talking to someone makes me feel normal for a little bit. but the second i‚Äôm alone again the tiredness and feeling miserable just comes back immediately.

i‚Äôve been sleeping twelve hours, and usually i fall asleep again for another few hours because i‚Äôm just tired, and i genuinely cannot get out of bed. i don‚Äôt have the energy. i get up probably five times a day to go to the toilet, shower and maybe eat if i can make myself.

usually this only lasts for about a month of just consistently being miserable, and it goes away eventually, but it‚Äôs been like four months.

what helps the tiredness? with the amount i‚Äôm sleeping i feel like i should be set on sleep for years but i just keep sleeping. i just wanna be able to stay awake for more than four hours without passing out because i‚Äôm so tired.",2,1750410971.0,bipolar,0,1.0,False

I slept for around 6 hours. When I woke up it was a little after 5pm, and I woke up sitting straight up at the end of the bed, with the box sitting open in front of me on the floor. This obviously freaked me the fuck out, but I‚Äôve been known to move around a bit in my sleep, so I didn‚Äôt think too much of it. There were multiple instances when I was a kid where I would wake up under my bed, or I‚Äôd go to bed in my room but wake up on the couch in the living room. Sometimes it just happened.¬†

I hopped up out of bed and made myself a shitty coffee in a styrofoam cup using the cheap instant coffee the motel room came stocked with. I sat back down on the bed ready to start looking through all of Danny‚Äôs messages when out of the corner of my eye something caught my attention. On the underside of one of the pieces of wood that made up the opening of the top of the box there was something inscribed in cursive. I moved to get a better look at it, and noticed it was carved into the wood in absolutely beautiful cursive.

This had most *certainly* not been there before I went to bed. I looked over every square inch of this box at Irene‚Äôs. Besides what was engraved on the top, it was just a regular box. I lifted it up and looked on the bottom, I felt around all over the inside, there had been nothing remarkable about it at all at the time. But now not only had something been carved on the inside, but it was an entire poem.

*Ownership has transferred, the cycle starts anew*

*The Box has traveled centuries and finds itself with you*

*Each of us adds a piece, to their accumulation*

*What waits inside, you‚Äôll have to see*

*Ecstasy or Damnation*

‚ÄúHoly *shit* Danny wasn‚Äôt lying. This thing has to be legit. I fucking *know* this wasn‚Äôt there when I checked it out at Irene‚Äôs place‚Äù I muttered to myself aloud in my motel room. But why is it there now? What changed between Irene‚Äôs and now that this wouldn‚Äôt have shown up earlier? I really racked my brain trying to find an excuse. Trying to convince myself that maybe I hadn‚Äôt been as thorough as I‚Äôd like to believe I was when I did my initial inspection, but there is absolutely no way I would have missed something as cryptic as this. This is literally *classic* scary movie shit. I started to get incredibly excited. The thought that I might really have something genuinely paranormal here was almost intoxicating. But I didn‚Äôt get to revel in the moment for too long before I was struck with a sobering thought. If this thing is actually paranormal then it has to be connected with what happened to Danny. But *how* exactly?¬†

I remembered what I‚Äôd told myself about reading through Danny‚Äôs messages when I woke up, and this new development reminded me of how important it must be. I knew I couldn‚Äôt put it off any longer, so I grabbed my coffee, took a couple deep breaths, and opened up my phone. I‚Äôve summarized some of the most important bits below.

The first message was a picture that Danny had taken. A selfie with the box behind him on the counter of the antique shop that he‚Äôd purchased it at. I recognized the cashier as the owner of the joint. His name was Marlon. Me and Danny would drive an hour outside of town almost once a month to see what kind of new stuff he‚Äôd been able to get his hands on. He came to know us so well that he started setting things aside that he thought we might be interested in.

The image was accompanied by a caption: ‚ÄúMy newest piece! Marlon said the old lady that brought it in claimed that she was getting rid of it after she started seeing ghosts or some shit. He also said she talked kind of funny, like she was putting on a fake accent or something. Said she just didn‚Äôt seem right. Anyway, you know I eat that kinda shit up so I had to buy it. I have no idea where I‚Äôm going to put it lol. Doesn‚Äôt matter though, I‚Äôve got a good feeling about this one. I‚Äôll put a hundred bucks on it‚Äù

Danny did eat that shit up. He‚Äôd buy a regular old banana if the guy selling it told an elaborate enough story to go along with it.¬†

The next thing he sent me was a video showing off the box inside and out. He was still at Marlon‚Äôs place.¬†

After that I got a video. It looked like it had been taken at Danny‚Äôs place. It started with Danny freaking out on camera. Screaming at me. ‚ÄúHoly shit dude I fuckin‚Äô knew it! I fuckin‚Äô told you dude! It‚Äôs time to go to the ATM, because I swear to God this wasn‚Äôt here when I bought it.‚Äù

The video panned to the underside of the lid of the box. There it was, the same damn poem that was there for me. Exactly the same. No wonder he was so excited to show me the thing.¬†

A couple of days went by between then and the next video. I could tell straight away that Danny was on something as soon as the video started. He posted his phone up his bedside table. He was sitting cross legged on his bed with the box in front of him. There was no sound attached to the video. It was just a six minute long video of Danny sitting in front of the box, then bending over and sticking his whole torso over the top dangling his head inside. He sat like that for five minutes or so before coming back out and turning the video off. I can‚Äôt even begin to imagine what that guy must have been seeing in there. This was the usual kind of stuff I was accustomed to Danny sending me. It was always cryptic, and he never explained it. I leaned over the edge of the bed to look down into the open box. I don‚Äôt know how he even managed to sit like that for so long. His neck would have had to have been crumpled up, with his face pressed into the bottom of the box. After seeing it in person it‚Äôs really only a couple feet deep.¬†

The next text came a couple of hours later. ‚ÄúDude you really have to come over and check this thing out. It‚Äôs not like anything I‚Äôve ever felt in my life. I always knew we‚Äôd find something real, man. And bring me that money you owe me when you do. Love you brother.‚Äù

That was the last thing he sent me that night. He texted me again the next morning. ‚ÄúBRO YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO COME CHECK THIS SHIT OUT. I swear I‚Äôm not making this up. I won‚Äôt tell you too much about it because I don‚Äôt wanna spoil it, but you just gotta trust me on this one. The next time your big boy job gives you a couple days off you need to come over. I promise it‚Äôll change your life.‚Äù

When I didn‚Äôt respond he texted me again an hour later. ‚ÄúLook Ian, I know I do this all the time, but I promise you this shit is different.‚Äù This was followed by a video of him saying his ABCs, followed by: ‚ÄúSee? Look at my eyes, I‚Äôm totally sober right now. I‚Äôve slept off last night and eaten today. Everything is out of my system by now, and I‚Äôm *still* telling you you gotta check this shit out.‚Äù

The next video was a week later. Two days before he went missing. Immediately things felt different. The video started off quiet, and the screen was completely black. Danny flipped the phone over like it had been lying on his bed and he turned it up to show his face. He was crying, and he looked like he hadn‚Äôt slept in a while. He looked disheveled. Danny was a pretty boy who cared about very few things, but he was vain. He took time to make sure he always looked good, and you had to pull him away from mirrors, but his hair was a mess, and his beard had started looking scraggly and unkempt. A single tear crept down his cheeks from both eyes. He didn‚Äôt say anything for a while, he just stared at his phone in silence. When he finally spoke it was only to say a single word. ‚ÄúPlease.‚Äù and he waited, and sat there as several more tears cascaded down his face. After some time he followed up with ‚ÄúPlease come take this thing from me. I can‚Äôt get rid of it. I can‚Äôt bring myself to do it. When it‚Äôs good it‚Äôs so fucking good, and it makes me forget about every bad thing that has ever happened to me. But when it‚Äôs bad Ian. When it‚Äôs bad it‚Äôs really really bad. Impossibly bad. I have seen things that I could never begin to  explain to you. That you could never begin to understand. Things that blot out the sun and flood the earth with an unfeeling and unrelenting darkness. But I keep going back. Please help me. I need help.‚Äù

I felt a cavern open up within my stomach. Deep enough to swallow up every ounce of joy, and laughter, and happiness that had ever been felt by any man or creature that has existed since the dawn of time. Things had been jovial up until this point. Danny was so proud of what he‚Äôd found, but now he pleaded desperately at the camera. At me.

If what I had been feeling earlier was guilt, then what I felt right now was nothing short of despair. ‚ÄúHoly shit I could have saved him. He was begging for me and I ignored him. And now he‚Äôs gone and I may never see him again and I couldn‚Äôt have been bothered enough to respond to a single one of his messages.‚Äù I thought to myself as I laid down on the bed and began to sob. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all my fault. It‚Äôs all my fault. It‚Äôs all my fault.‚Äù The only thing that repeats in my head for what feels like hours. Over and over and over. I lay there in silence and sob to myself.

The only thing keeping me from completely collapsing at this point is the thought there is no way I could‚Äôve known. This shit isn‚Äôt real. At least that‚Äôs what I had spent almost 25 years believing. No, I didn‚Äôt believe that, I knew it. I knew that the supernatural didn‚Äôt exist like it was an incontrovertible fact. It would have been absurd for me to assume that anything like this could have possibly been happening. And I still don‚Äôt have any idea what actually *is* happening. What already happened.

After that video he sent me a couple other voice messages about unexplainable things happening at his house. Clothes went missing. His cologne went missing. All of his favorite records were even taken. But he said it didn‚Äôt make any sense. Since he found the box he‚Äôd virtually stopped going to work until they ended up firing him. He said he almost burned straight through what little savings he had ordering all of his food delivered to his house. He *never* left. So how could someone have gotten into his house to take anything. Danny said that the only thing he could possibly conceptualize as an explanation was that he was sleep walking and getting rid of it himself. He muttered something about how he‚Äôd been finding videos on his phone that he had no recollection of taking, so it only had to make since that if he was walking around taking videos without remembering it then he had to be throwing away his own shit.

It was hard not to think that he was losing his fucking mind. Hell, he actually might have been. I‚Äôve known Danny a long time and I‚Äôve never seen him display even a fraction of as much emotion as he did in that last video. ‚ÄúJesus Christ Danny, what happened to you?‚Äù

The last day Danny messaged me was the day his house burnt down. It was another video of Danny chest deep inside of the box. I watched it all the way through hoping that something else would happen. It was over ten minutes straight of nothing but Danny sitting with his head in a box, completely silent and unmoving. Until eventually it cuts to black. The next message is the last one he sent me. The box sitting closed on his floor, with the majority of the contents of his room seemingly having vanished into thin air in a perfect circle, with the box as the epicenter of whatever disaster had occurred.

I sat in silence for a few moments. Once again trying to work up the courage to do the new hardest thing I‚Äôve done this year for the second time today. Working up the courage to see if I could figure out what‚Äôs going on with that box.¬†

I could feel its allure from across the room. I felt it before I fell asleep but I thought it was just the exhaustion of my mind playing tricks on me but I could feel a very real pull to investigate it. Like weak magnets trying to connect to one another through a sheet of paper, the attraction was faint, but real nonetheless.¬†

Damn. My coffee went cold. The only thing worse than cheap motel instant coffee is *reheated* cheap motel instant coffee. But it‚Äôs all I‚Äôve got, so I pop it in the microwave.¬†

I hit the ‚ÄúAdd 30 seconds button‚Äù a few too many times and run to the bathroom real quick. On my way out I get another text from Irene. ‚ÄúYou learn anything new about the so-called ‚ÄòGate‚Äô yet?‚Äù

I spent too long thinking of a reply and forgot about my coffee. Damn. Now it‚Äôs boiling hot. And I couldn‚Äôt bear to talk to Irene at the moment so I just decided not to respond.

I grab my styrofoam cup out of the microwave and the box off the floor and sit down with both of them on the bed. I had no idea what I was supposed to be doing. I re-inspect every square inch of the damn thing and couldn‚Äôt find anything else special about it, but I couldn‚Äôt get the poem out of my head.¬†

‚ÄúWhat waits inside you‚Äôll have to see, ecstasy or damnation‚Äù I whisper to myself. ‚ÄúWhat could that possibly mean?‚Äù. I think back to what I‚Äôd seen in Danny‚Äôs videos. About how he would stick his head into the bottom of it. I thought it was just the delusional actions of a man on far too many hallucinogens, but maybe it had a point? ‚ÄúIs there something else written on the bottom of it that I just can‚Äôt see from this far away?‚Äù

I set the coffee precariously between my crossed legs and reach my head into the box, squinting and straining my eyes in search of another clue as to what the fuck might be going on. Maybe I‚Äôm losing my mind? As I stretch in over the edge of the box to get my eyes closer to the bottom I swear it moves away from me. Not in any physical way, like the bottom of the box isn‚Äôt getting deeper from the outside. I peek my head back out just to make sure. ‚ÄúNope, it looks exactly the same as it did before.‚Äù I go back in to see if my eyes were playing tricks on me and the floor of the box is definitely moving farther away, so I just keep stretching until‚Ä¶

In what appears to occur quicker than I can even comprehend it I am in a completely different room. But I never moved my legs? I don‚Äôt know if somehow I fell over the side of the box, or if I‚Äôm not physically here at all, but for all intents and purposes I am NOT in bed in my motel room anymore. In Danny‚Äôs videos it was only his torso that was in the box, so I assume that outside of‚Ä¶ wherever I am, my body is just slumped over the edges of the box. In between hyperventilating, the thought of that scene actually gives me a small laugh, but not enough to keep me from panicking. I am breathing *way* too fast, and the thought of passing out on the floor of what could actually be an other-dimensional world makes me panic even more. I try my damndest to hold it together but in the edges of my vision I can see the same shadows creeping in again.¬†

In one last burst for self preservation I yank myself conscious, akin to the way you shoot out of bed right before the worst moment of your nightmare is about to occur and when I calm down enough to be aware of my surroundings I‚Äôm back in the motel bed. Just as I‚Äôm gathering my wits about me I realize that I am in excruciating pain. I give myself a pat down to make sure that my body still exists the way it did before I went through‚Ä¶ whatever that just was, and I realize that when I entered the box my coffee must have spilled on me. My boiling hot coffee had spilled on my lap, most likely at the same time I entered the gate, leaving me with what I have to imagine is at least 2nd degree burns. And I didn‚Äôt feel a thing. As if my physical body was completely cut off from my mind. But I *was* physically there.

I could feel the cold stone beneath my bare feet that the floor of the room I was standing in was made of. I could smell the vaguely sweet scent of lavender, as if it was wafting into the room from beneath a door or a vent somewhere. I could *taste* the air. What I imagine the air among the mountains of Switzerland or the cherry blossoms of Japan must taste like. Nearly all of my senses told me that I was *physically* there. Even through my panic I was aware of that. I contemplated through all of this as I grit my teeth and bore through an ice cold shower to try and bring me some relief from the pain of what I‚Äôd be willing to bet are probably 3rd degree burns. As the adrenaline wore off and pain grew even more intense between my thighs, and as I could still feel them burning despite what the rest of my body was telling me about the temperature of this shower, I knew. I needed to go to the hospital for the second time within 24 hours.

I got out of the shower and put my clothes on, and prepared to head to the hospital yet again. Fortunately, I still had some painkillers from yesterday to get me through the drive. I took one or two more than I probably needed and started heading out the door, only needing to put my shoes on before I could leave. I couldn‚Äôt find my socks so I just jammed my feet into my shoes and headed out.

I‚Äôve been sitting in a hospital bed for a few hours waiting to find out what treatment will be. It‚Äôs bad enough that they‚Äôve had me on an IV painkiller of some kind. I figured that now was the best time to type out everything that I had experienced today. The pain from the burn mixed with the dulling of my mind from the painkillers has stopped me from really giving it too much thought, but as I write this I have no choice but to face it. The things I‚Äôve seen and experienced today have fundamentally changed my perception of the world that I exist in. I‚Äôm trying not to think about Danny, which is difficult because he and the box are inextricably linked to each other in my mind. And I can‚Äôt think of anything but that box. The Gate. I want to go back. As soon as I get out of here and get some rest I‚Äôm ready to face that unknown. It‚Äôs like a splinter in my brain that‚Äôs wedged so far in that even the finest tools of modern science would be helpless to reach it. My only hope for respite lies in the bottom of that box.

I will keep everyone updated as soon as I can with whatever happens next.

Long time lurker here. I've officially been out of her house for a year now, and I've been thinking a lot about something that happened not long before I finally escaped. It felt like the push I needed to not feel bad about moving out.

I was working at a small coffee shop at the time, and I was on a closing shift. I mopped the floors that night around 8:00pm when the shop closed. The pump we used for mop water was apparently not refilled correctly, which led to WAY too much of the floor cleaning agent being pumped into the water.

I ended up inhaling a little too much of the fumes while I was mopping, and started coughing soon after I was done. My lungs are already a little weak due to my Ngrandmother being a heavy indoor smoker. She lived in the same house as me for my whole life until I moved out, and refuses to smoke outside because it's ""her house."" Spoiler alert: she isn't on the lease and pays for nothing except her cigarettes and diet cokes. Anyways.

Later on in the night, my cough got worse and I started to struggle to breathe. Not like anaphylaxis or something, but it felt like they were working at 50%. I have never experienced that since I don't have severe allergies or asthma, so I was of course very afraid. At about 11:00pm, I was freaking out a little and told my uncle I felt like I needed to go to the hospital. (Note: at this time I also struggled with intense anxiety due to the environment i was in.) He was worried, like any normal person would be. And then there was Nmom.

""Seriously? Why couldn't you have told us earlier? Why did you have to wait so late in the night? Now you're gonna make me or your uncle drive in the middle of the night, and it's not gonna be me because I can't drive at night!""

The whole drive there, she continued to repeat similar things and make me feel like an inconvenience, and like I was overreacting. I told her I didn't know what else to do, that I was scared. She did that annoyed narc sigh and we spent most of that visit in silence. What wasn't silence was her asking if I felt better now, condescendingly. After the follow up with my primary care doctor, he confirmed my anxieties about being around a heavy smoker causing vulnerabilities in my lungs. Recommended that I move out asap if she won't stop smoking indoors.

I know it's a pointless endeavor trying to make sense of an Nparent's actions, but I do struggle with trying to find reason in this night specifically.",2,1750410204.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

1lfz9a4,https://forms.gle/SDGZs1Xm3njWunGV8,Interesting Study on Maladaptive Daydreaming,"**Ever acted out your daydreams? Or do you daydream at all? Is it pleasurable? Distressing? Or maybe... both?**

Have you ever found yourself lost in a world so vivid it almost feels real? A story so intricate and absorbing that you catch yourself pacing, whispering lines, moving your hands as if you were actually¬†*there*¬†in your mind‚Äôs creation? If this resonates with you, you might be brushing up against the phenomenon known as¬†**maladaptive daydreaming**‚Äîan emerging psychological construct that sits at the curious intersection of fantasy and dysfunction.

üéì¬†**About**¬†Me:  
Hi, I‚Äôm¬†**Arya Jade**, a postgraduate student in¬†**Clinical Psychology**¬†at¬†**Christ University, Bangalore**. My current research dives deep into a topic that is as mysterious as it is relatable:

**""The Cost of Escapism: Relationship between Maladaptive Daydreaming, Empathy, and Rumination.""**

This isn‚Äôt just an academic curiosity. For many, maladaptive daydreaming isn‚Äôt mere zoning out. It is an intricate, emotionally loaded experience that can last for hours, involving imagined characters, elaborate plots, and sometimes even ritualized physical movements to enhance the fantasy. People may laugh, cry, or act out scenes in private. And while it can be deeply pleasurable, it can also interfere with daily life, academic functioning, relationships, and emotional health. The line between creativity and compulsion becomes blurred, and that is where the science comes in.

üå±¬†**You‚Äôre eligible**¬†if:  
‚úÖ You're aged between¬†**18‚Äì30**  
‚úÖ You‚Äôre¬†**comfortable with English**

Completely¬†**anonymous**¬†and¬†**voluntary**  
No identifying information is collected  
You‚Äôre free to¬†**exit anytime**¬†with no strings attached

üîç Through this research, we‚Äôre hoping to uncover how patterns of excessive daydreaming are related to¬†**empa**thy (our ability to understand others) and¬†**ruminat**ion (our tendency to overthink or dwell). Are people who daydream more likely to empathize with fictional or real-world suffering? Or does their emotional energy get stuck in internal loops? These are the questions that might help refine how we understand not just maladaptive daydreaming, but also broader mechanisms of mental health in young adults.

1lfz8wy,https://www.reddit.com/r/NaturalLifeHacks/comments/1lfz8wy/what_lactose_intolerance_symptoms_heres_what/,What lactose intolerance symptoms? Here‚Äôs what surprised me,"For the longest time, I didn‚Äôt even realize I had **lactose intolerance**. I wasn‚Äôt running to the bathroom like people say. No dramatic moments. Just subtle stuff that I brushed off: bloating after lunch, gurgling noises after coffee, feeling overly full after a single slice of pizza.

If you‚Äôre asking *what lactose intolerance symptoms?* \- and you‚Äôre not sure what to look for - let me share what I found out the hard way.

**It‚Äôs not always obvious**  
Everyone talks about gas and diarrhea, but those aren‚Äôt the only signs. For me, it was:

* Bloating that made my jeans tight an hour after eating
* Mild stomach cramps that came and went
* Feeling sluggish or nauseous after creamy dishes
* Occasional constipation
* A weird pressure in my gut that I chalked up to ‚Äújust digestion‚Äù

What finally clued me in was cutting dairy out for a week, and suddenly I felt *better*. Less heavy. More regular. And no weird gassy feelings after meals.

**Turns out lactose intolerance is a spectrum**  
Not everyone reacts the same way. Some people can‚Äôt even handle a splash of milk. Others are fine with cheese but react to yogurt. For me, it was random foods that caught me off guard, a buttery pasta sauce, a baked dessert, a coffee with milk.

The problem is, lactose is in more foods than you think. So unless you‚Äôre checking every label or fully giving up dairy, you‚Äôll probably run into it often.

**What helped me feel normal again: DairyPill**  
I didn‚Äôt want to cut out dairy completely, it‚Äôs in too much. So I started trying enzyme pills. Most of the ones from the store didn‚Äôt do much. Sometimes I‚Äôd need two or three to avoid symptoms, and even then, I‚Äôd still feel off.

Then someone mentioned **DairyPill**, which I hadn‚Äôt heard of before. What stood out is that it‚Äôs **way stronger** than most others - **18,000 FCC units of lactase per pill**, compared to 3,000‚Äì9,000 in most brands. And it actually worked.

I take **one pill** before any meal with dairy and haven‚Äôt had a single issue since. No bloating, no stomach flips, no mystery discomfort.

Here‚Äôs where I got mine:  
[**DairyPill Official Offer Page**](https://getdairypill.com/offer-01/?lpid=1059&source_id=DL&utm_source=8928&utm_medium=&utm_term=1059&aff_id=8928&sub_id=&req_id=&oid=1059&device_type=&country_name=&oid=1059&affid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/NaturalLifeHacks)

And here‚Äôs another useful link with more info:  
[**What Makes DairyPill Different**](https://getdairypill.com/listicle/?lpid=2614&source_id=DL&utm_source=8928&utm_medium=&utm_term=1059&aff_id=8928&sub_id=&req_id=&oid=1059&device_type=&country_name=&uid=2614&oid=1059&affid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/NaturalLifeHacks)

**It‚Äôs simple: one pill, one meal, no issues**  
No timing games. No guesswork. It works with ice cream, pizza, milkshakes, pretty much anything I‚Äôve tried so far. The **Key Pod** (small keychain case) makes it easy to carry too.

**Real talk - if you‚Äôve been feeling ‚Äúoff‚Äù after dairy but haven‚Äôt had a full-blown reaction, it might still be lactose intolerance**  
Mild or moderate symptoms can be overlooked for years. I thought I just had a sensitive stomach. Turns out my body just wasn‚Äôt breaking down lactose properly, and **DairyPill** gave me the support it needed.

If you're dealing with weird digestion and no one's been able to explain it, this might be a path worth exploring. Let me know if you've tried it or something else that helped - curious to hear what others have figured out.",1,1750409965.0,NaturalLifeHacks,0,1.0,False

Or at least it feels that way and maybe I‚Äôm wrong . What should my title really be, and how underpaid am I? Or do I just need to shut up and put on my big girl pants? 

I have diagnosed ADHD, and while I‚Äôm medicated, the sheer chaos and overload is making me question my sanity lately.

Here‚Äôs a slice of what I‚Äôve done just this week:
	‚Ä¢	Created an O&M SOQ for a huge national client (wrote, formatted, coordinated it solo)
	‚Ä¢	Wrote a full federal contracting proposal based on complex innovation I barely understand‚Äîwith minimal technical input
	‚Ä¢	Designed custom technical graphics for that proposal
	‚Ä¢	Drafted a workshop session proposal solo (no direction from anyone despite it being for their field)
	‚Ä¢	Built a co-branded slide deck, mockups, and marketing materials for a new national partner
	‚Ä¢	Managed everything for an upcoming out-of-state trade show: collateral, travel, signage, swag, social content, booth prep
	‚Ä¢	Created a video using AI‚Äîbut the AI was just a tool, not the substance. I wrote and edited the script myself
	‚Ä¢	Did market research, stakeholder targeting, and email scripting for a niche new vertical leadership is exploring
	‚Ä¢	Created a newsletter I was told to measure results for‚Äîwithout a contact list, so I now have to hunt people down internally to build one
	‚Ä¢	Wrote all updated website content (IT just pastes it in)
	‚Ä¢	Researched new associations to join and made a case for one we should target‚Äîstill waiting on leadership to review it
	‚Ä¢	Got asked to figure out who‚Äôs attending what between me and the sales head for an upcoming summit
	‚Ä¢	Oh‚Äîand I also manage embroidered polos now, apparently üôÉ

I‚Äôm constantly task-switching between high-level strategic thinking, graphic design, proposal writing, internal comms, and technical translation. I often feel like I‚Äôm ‚Äúwinging it‚Äù because I get no guidance or collaboration. It‚Äôs like being told to pilot a plane after being handed a wrench and a coffee.

The kicker? My work is frequently minimized by leadership. I tried to casually bring this up and got hit with ‚ÄúWelcome to a full plate!‚Äù as a response. (The VP of Sales isn‚Äôt technically my boss, but we interact constantly, and yes‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs my dad.)

I like the people I work with. But the disorganization, unrealistic expectations, and lack of structure make me feel inefficient, anxious, and like I‚Äôm falling behind‚Äîeven though I‚Äôm objectively producing a shit ton. 

So here‚Äôs what I need help with:
	1.	What job title actually fits what I‚Äôm doing?
	2.	What salary should I realistically be making (even part-time) given the level and volume of this work?
	3.	Has anyone else navigated being the only person in a role like this with ADHD? Any survival tips?

Thanks in advance if you made it through this chaos dump.

Before people tell me, yes I know I could leave, no this is not a nepotism, crybaby scenario, there are personal reasons I am staying at this job for at least another year, and most of the time I actually love my job, but I feel like this is getting out of hand and I‚Äôm not valued and I don‚Äôt know just feels really really crappy.

Just wondering if I‚Äôve got a quick fix on my hands or time to look elsewhere.

I had to replace both the felt and paddle wheel. The felt had broken apart and caused a blockage, which then caused damage to the paddle wheel.

I‚Äôve replaced both of those today but this has caused more issues. I went to use it and another blockage occurred but I‚Äôm not sure why. Last time the blockage was the damaged felt, but there didn‚Äôt look to be anything this time. The machine also made more of a whirring noise this time.

I usually have the setting at approx 13, but anything below 30 would cause a blockage and 30 worked.

While it was running with the blockage, the quick release has fallen off and taken some of the drive shaft with it (and it‚Äôs stuck in the quick release).

I don‚Äôt really know where to from here and am just missing my daily coffees. Off to the supermarket to go get some ground coffee for now.

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response‚Äîor lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

In the bustling metropolis of Neon City, skyscrapers touched the heavens, their dazzling lights reflecting off the sleek surfaces of futuristic cars. Yet, nestled within this urban jungle, an ancient relic stood defiantly‚Äîthe Old Grove Park.

As I strolled through the city's concrete arteries, the juxtaposition between the modernity of Neon City and the timeless serenity of the park became increasingly apparent. The cacophony of traffic was replaced by the rustling of leaves and the distant laughter of children playing.

The central conflict emerged when the city council, embodying the epitome of order, proposed transforming the park into a technologically advanced hub. The juxtaposition intensified as architects discussed plans for holographic playgrounds and virtual reality gardens within the confines of the Old Grove Park.

Through a thousand words, I explored the clash of ideals, the struggle between progress and preservation. The ancient trees became silent witnesses to heated debates at town hall meetings, where environmentalists and tech enthusiasts engaged in a battle of words. The juxtaposition of the towering skyscrapers against the gnarled branches of the park's oldest tree mirrored the tension in Neon City's collective conscience.

**Response to Prompt 27: Symbolism**

In the quaint town of Willowbrook, the arrival of a single dove carried profound significance. Its graceful descent into the town square was a symbol, an omen that whispered of impending change. As a budding novelist with a penchant for symbolism, I couldn't resist exploring the layers of meaning embedded in this seemingly mundane event.

For a thousand words, I dissected the impact of the dove on the lives of Willowbrook's residents. The mayor saw it as a sign of prosperity, the local florist interpreted it as a call for unity, and the elderly storyteller regarded it as a harbinger of forgotten tales. The dove's symbolism rippled through the town, influencing decisions and shaping destinies.

The once quaint town underwent a transformative metamorphosis, and the symbolism of the dove became a thread that wove through the narrative, connecting disparate lives in unexpected ways.

In the dimly lit alleyways of Serpent's Hollow, darkness wrapped its cold arms around me‚Äîan eerie catachresis that mirrored the ominous atmosphere. The assignment was to explore the underbelly of the city, and as a novice reporter, I found myself navigating the labyrinth of deceit and shadows.

For a thousand words, I delved into the catachresis-infused descriptions of the characters populating Serpent's Hollow. The crime lord, known as the Velvet Serpent, ruled the district with a velvet-gloved fist. His lair, a dilapidated mansion, exuded an air of faded grandeur that served as a catachresis for the empire he once commanded.

As I chronicled the criminal underworld, the catachresis became a literary tool to convey the complexity and decay inherent in Serpent's Hollow. The labyrinthine plots, the twisted allegiances, and the morally ambiguous characters all found expression through catachresis, painting a vivid picture of a city where metaphor and reality intertwined.

The hyperbole hung in the air, a thick fog of anticipation enveloping the village. As I delved into the story, the hyperbolic reactions of Mistwood's residents heightened the absurdity of the situation. What began as a mere visit from a mystical figure transformed into a fantastical escapade, with the fortune teller's prophecies shaping the destiny of the villagers in ludicrous ways.

Through the hyperbolic lens, I explored the comedic consequences of taking ordinary events to extraordinary extremes.

The narrative unfolded with the vibrant expressions of onomatopoeia, capturing the essence of the city's sonic landscape. The performer's drumming evoked the rhythmic tap-tap of raindrops, while his wind instruments mimicked the whoosh of passing cars. The city, typically drowned in noise, became a canvas for this auditory artist.

As I delved into the story, the onomatopoeic symphony became a language of its own. The characters communicated through the vibrant echoes of everyday sounds, fostering a unique connection between the performer and the people of Metropolis. The narrative danced to the beat of onomatopoeic creativity, transforming the mundane into a dynamic celebration of city life.

In the technologically advanced city of Silicon Haven, where sleek skyscrapers touched the sky and holographic billboards painted the air with luminescent advertisements, a hidden oasis existed‚Äîa pocket of nature known as the Zen Garden. The juxtaposition of these contrasting elements created a visual paradox that fascinated both residents and visitors alike.

As the narrative unfolded, the stark contrast between the city's cutting-edge architecture and the serene beauty of the Zen Garden became a metaphor for the characters' internal conflicts. The bustling metropolis symbolized progress and innovation, while the tranquil garden embodied the need for balance and introspection.

Through the lens of juxtaposition, I explored the dichotomy within the characters as they navigated the relentless pace of Silicon Haven.

The Iron Throne Statement, while seemingly straightforward, carried the weight of a thousand debates, negotiations, and betrayals. Its impact rippled through the lives of citizens, shaping their destinies in ways they could scarcely fathom.

Through the lens of metonymy, I delved into the layers of meaning hidden within this political shorthand. The characters grappled not only with the literal implications of the Iron Throne Statement but also with the overarching themes of power, ambition, and the sacrifices demanded by political gamesmanship.

In the dystopian city of Emberfall, where the remnants of a fallen civilization lay entwined with the shadows of despair, a lone figure emerged‚Äîa rebel determined to dismantle the oppressive regime. The narrative unfolded with the rapid pace of asyndeton, omitting conjunctions to mirror the urgency of the protagonist's quest.

Through a cascade of words, the asyndeton propelled the reader through the city's decaying alleyways and towering citadels, each sentence building upon the last. The disjointed rhythm captured the relentless momentum of the rebel's journey, emphasizing the magnitude of the challenges faced in their struggle for freedom.

As the narrative unfurled, the absence of conjunctions served as a narrative device, intensifying the sense of urgency and desperation that permeated Emberfall. The rebel's asyndetic odyssey unfolded against a backdrop of shattered hopes and whispered rebellions, culminating in a crescendo of defiance against the oppressive regime.

Amidst the starlit expanse of Cosmos Haven, where galaxies danced in celestial choreography, a cryptic prophecy emerged‚Äîa message written in the stars. As the narrative unfolded, I embarked on a cosmic journey guided by the acrostic hidden within the constellations.

For a cascade of words, the initial letters of key phrases illuminated the path of destiny for the characters. Each sentence unfolded with intention, revealing a hidden message that transcended the boundaries of time and space. The acrostic became a celestial guide, leading the protagonists through the intricate tapestry of their interconnected fates.

Through the lens of acrostic, I explored the cosmic forces that shaped the destinies of Cosmos Haven's inhabitants. The celestial bodies became storytellers, each constellation contributing a verse to the epic narrative written across the cosmos. As the characters deciphered the acrostic, they unraveled the mysteries of their existence, connecting the dots between the stars and their own profound journeys.

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out? Will the world simply become so politically correct that it dies a depressed death while AI simply decides we are too much of a virus to live? 

Who knows....I do not. But these are indicidive of a future full of b movie plot garbage that are based on Wattpad tropes with no clear details and no plot to get into, so that sucks.",1,1750408235.0,writingthruit,0,1.0,False

My search criteria was a lake or river where people came to gather to swim and picknick and such, in large numbers. Because i'm from the Netherlands i kind of like such places. And we have lots of them. The best and only one i found was Lough Lene ‚Äì Collinstown, Co. Westmeath.  
But after some research it does seem very limited. So i kept searching. This time closer to Dublin.  
  
During my search a place called D√∫n Laoghaire Baths popped up. And the description said it was just renovated for 18 million Euro's. So i was like, thats great. They must really have done their best to create soemthing nice for random warm weather people and families to go to, picknic, or whatever you do with recreational swimming.  
But to my amazent it was just a nice sight seeing spot with a art room inside. It's essentially a nice sea-access platform with Instagram potential where you can sip some coffee. But it does have swimming  potential for the future (There‚Äôs a hollow structure beneath that might one day become a tidal pool). While before the renovation there was a actual bath.

Am i stupid to be disapointed? It's such a nice location with great recreational potential.  
But anyway, i don't think Ireland has many recreational outdoors swimming like you have in the Netherlands and Nordic countries. It's all wild swimming, and i readin most places the natural water bodies are not even checked for ""polution"" and what not. And lots of lakes and rivers are dangerous to swim in.

I kind of tried to avoid the beach at the ocean. But i guess thats the only good choice around Dublin. (I prefer lakes cause they warm up faster in the summer). Or maybe i just book a holiday to Beeksebergen holiday safari park.",1,1750408198.0,AskIreland,7,0.67,False

**I feel like dark clouds are gathering above our heads because we either lack clarity or don't see enough progress to keep going. It's a tough place to be, but pretty much every entrepreneur suffers from this. So here I am, looking for a piece of bread, I mean, validation!**

Imagine plugging your company data into a tool and instead of scrolling through a jungle of dashboards and noodle charts early in the morning, you simply type in ""Who's the most profitable employee this month?"" and go grab yourself a cup of coffee.

You come back and you have an answer, an action plan, and forecasts right in front of you, all while sipping on that dark-as-night coffee that would make a steed kick the bucket with its caffeine content.

At least that's the ""marketing"" part of the tool. I'm looking for insights and advice on how it could grow and where else to apply it.

In general, it's a platform that currently uses our company data as the primary data set. It has several integrations like Jira, Everhour, Sendgrid, and some book-keeping software to pull salaries and other related data. We have data charts to visualize all of this data, but the highlight is that you can chat with an AI agent to pull specific data for you.

Under the hood, we have developed several agents. Like worker agents, QA agents, reasoning agents, calculation agents, etc. These agents can then choose from a variety of tools that interact with said integrations.

One tool may pull Jira data and combine it with Everhour tracked time, while the other tool may calculate revenue, profits, margins, and make a forecast based on the efficiency of any employee.

The AI here is like a director of smaller, more specialized AI agents who have access to tools or functions. And the final result is then returned to the user.

On top of that, we have added periodical analyses. Let's say you may ask the AI to ""Generate a report of who tracked the most time and worked on the most Jira tickets. Send it to me every day at 5 pm"". This would trigger an analysis generator agent that would schedule a job that generates said report and sends it to you via email.

So far, it's been great using it internally, and I see a lot of potential going into different industries like e-commerce, logistics, or some SMBs. We have even started working on preparing a demo on how it would integrate with one of the most used bookkeeping software in the country, known for its archaic complexity and rampant confusion.

What do you think?

Is it something that has potential, or am I just working on a ""pretty cool"" tool with barely any use case?",0,1750408177.0,startups,2,0.5,False

1lfymie,https://i.redd.it/lu2zd5y6h18f1.png,"Aamir Khan‚Äôs 'Sitaare Zameen Par' isn‚Äôt just a film‚Äîit‚Äôs a gentle reminder that kindness, hope, and laughter still matter. A spiritual sequel to 'Taare Zameen Par', it may not hit as hard emotionally, but its warmth and message shine just as brightly. Read more in description.","Director RS Prasanna injects a sense of unlikely fun throughout the film. Every joke lands. Every emotional beat feels organic. Aamir Khan's impeccable expressions never miss the mark. Honestly, while you might go in expecting eyes to well up like they did during 'TZP', this one surprises you with how light-hearted, warm, and genuinely funny it is.



The only gripe with 'Sitaare Zameen Par' is its runtime - at two hours and 39 minutes, the film drags, particularly in the second half. Tighter editing and trimming a few scenes would have made it far more engaging.



In 'Sitaare Zameen Par', Khan urges you to live fearlessly, carrying kindness in your heart. His trademark arched eyebrows and self-pitying glances offer glimpses into a man in the process of self-discovery. And that's something you can't take away from Khan - his protagonists often push you to be a better person. Yes, they might get preachy on the way, but more often than not, they bring you home. There's a quiet sense of victory by the end. You might be facing the weakest moment of your life - down, humiliated, hopeless - but Khan's films tell you to give it one more shot and find joy wherever you are in life. That, perhaps, is the greatest strength of 'Sitaare Zameen Par'.

The film gently nudges you to get up, smell the coffee again, pluck the colourful flowers, greet the rising sun, and simply try one more time.

The beauty of 'Sitaare Zameen Par' lies in the fact that it isn't trying to be anything it's not. There are no hidden metaphors or layered messages to decode. It is what it is - not a flawless portrayal of emotion, but a story with its heart in the right place. And oh, when it makes you laugh, it really makes you laugh. It puts to shame all those so-called comedies built on crass humour and sexist jokes.

Brijendra Kala and Dolly Ahluwalia are an absolute treat. Ashish Pendse, Aroush Datta, Aayush Bhansali, Rishi Shahani, GopiKrishnan K Verma, Rishabh Jain, Vedant Sharma, Simran Mangeshkar, Samvit Desai, and Naman Misra form a starry team around Khan - perhaps the best supporting cast he's ever had. While Khan's performance remains effortless and charismatic, these children elevate the film with warmth and joy.

'Sitaare Zameen Par' is a well-intentioned, extremely funny, family film. It doesn't rely on cheap laughs, nor does it belittle anyone to make a point. Genelia D'Souza as Suneeta is a refreshing presence, playing a role her age - a real woman who gives her emotionally confused husband multiple chances to align their wavelengths.

You don't need any preparation to watch this film - it comes easily to you. One moment you are seated, and the next, you are rolling down in laughter. The humour is its USP; the performances are its soul.

Aamir Khan returns with a tickling feather and a promise: a story for all ages, all kinds, and all shades of normal. Because there's 'sabka apna apna' normal. You don't fear it. You don't shoo it away. Your normal is acceptable - and so is mine.",1,1750407384.0,IndiaTodayLIVE,0,1.0,False
