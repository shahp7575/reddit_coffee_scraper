1omldd3,https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/1omldd3/mcdonalds_is_using_a_coupon_theft/,McDonald's Is Using a Coupon Theft?,"Hey you guys I just recently heard about the McDonald's monopoly game at McDonald's and I heard about all the free food that people were winning and decided to give it a try. Lo and behold I started to win a bunch of free food. It was little stuff like a small fry or some cookies, but free food is free food. I also heard about the kiosk trick for getting your orders faster. So I started to cash out some of my winnings, but on the last few occasions I could overhear the staff talking about my order and sounding perturbed or annoyed about it.

One time I went in to redeem a buy one get one free sandwich, it's a promo where you buy one sandwich and you can get any sandwich for equal or lesser value. I had a little money that day so I decided to get something I've never had from McDonald's a quarter pounder with bacon. (I really wanted a double Quarter pounder, but the young lady behind the counter misheard me) So As I'm waiting for my sandwiches I decided to go to the kiosk and redeem some free cookies I had in the app and when I did I could hear them in the back talking about me ""That guy wanted a burger for free ect"" So when I heard that I just logged off the app got one order of free cookies two, instead of two orders of free cookies four and left.

Funny thing is when I got the burgers home and heated them up in the microwave they were nothing special didn't even have the flavor of the original. All I could taste was the heat of the burger and the texture of the meat but no great flavor from the burger itself. 

The only reason I even used the buy one get one free is because I heard a lady in another area had a promo receipt that had a free six piece nugget no purchase necessary. So I said if she can do that surely I can take advantage of a buy one get one free. I could, but I had to endure people talking smack.

Just today I went into to redeem a breakfast sandwich and a small coffee. (I said to myself I'm not going to get too many items at one time anymore cause I don't want to overwhelm them. I heard of people literally walking out with 20+ items at once I've never done more than four)

So I just get two items a breakfast biscuit and a coffee from my coupons in the app and again I heard murmuring in the back and the manager literally took down the Monopoly game sign while I was sitting waiting for my coffee.

Look I get it you don't like people getting free food, maybe the workers feel taken advantage of. This is the last day of the monopoly game so she is within her rights to take down the sign, but it felt personal with me still sitting in the store. Like she wanted to make sure I knew that the game was over. I'm a broke dude.

I live in a group home in one of the poorest parts of New Orleans. You work at McDonald's I'm sure the corporate offices of McDonald's reimburses the local franchises who participate in the game or who has special promotions. Why are you treating me like I'm a shoplifter when I'm just a broke dude trying to get a good snack while supplies last.

Am I a thief for using a coupon if you didn't want me to use it why offer it? I  have about five more free things in the app but I may just let them expire to avoid the dirty looks and smack talk thanks for listening .",1,1762099993.0,povertyfinance,1,1.0,False
1omld8d,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1omld8d,Ordered 16 niche and designer decants - a review,"I ordered a variety of 16 niche and designer 2ml decants. Wanted to try out some potential versatile daily scents, some aromatic fougeres, gourmands, leather forward scents, and just a variety that sounded appealing to my tastes. I would say I’m relatively early on in my fragrance hobby, only been collecting a couple years. Took notes on my phone reviewing them and figured I’d share here just in case any of you have been curious about these. Put an out of 10 score at the bottom of each for fun, but I didn’t use a complex scoring criteria these are just my opinions. Let me know if I should share my future list of scents that I want to try decants of next! I only ended up buying a full bottle of one out of the below 16 scents. 


- Nishane Wulong Cha - can dress it down or dress it up, casual, relaxing scent. green tea, moss, lemony, airy, not getting too much woodsy smell.  Something else in there almost like a vegetable smoothie or cucumber. Not just a summer/spring scent, could easily wear this in fall/winter with more sprays. Arguably androgynous. 8.5/10

- Nishane B612 - woody, lavender, kind of smells like I’m in the woods. Fern/wet tree kind of smell, spices. Very comforting and confident. (Want to try Platinum Egoiste before I purchase a fougere). Versatile, year-round scent.  8/10

- Mancera Cedrat Boise Intense - more powdery than I expected. Ripe citrus and lemony, woody, a little spicy, the strong sweetness went away pretty quickly. Synthetic mildy sweet dry down but the dry down is much more appealing than the first hour. 7/10

- PDM Layton - insanely good and I understand the hype now - cinnamon forward, apple, warm, spicy, lavender and then vanillic with maybe some cardamom? Smells like masculine fragrance that’s slightly juvenile and immediately makes me feel special. Does have a menthol/vicks type of smell but to me it’s nice and separates it from generic/designer type of smell. Really evolves through the dry down from an intense, powerful to a subtle, powdery, alluring scent. My favorite one I smelled out of this order, I just bought a bottle. 9/10

- Prada L’homme Intense - so clean but also dark. Similar to the laundry fresh flanker lhomme leau but darker, warmer, almost chocolatey. Strong iris note. Not very good projection or longevity, fades pretty fast. I would honestly prefer YSL La Nuit De L’homme for a dark, classy, powdery, skin scent with short longevity. 7/10

- Hugo Boss Bottled Absolu - unique for a designer, not generic smelling. Was against it at first, medicinal opening. Incense and comforting warm spicy feel is so alluring, warms you up and almost syrupy in an appealing way. Amber/vanillic dry down, sweet, warm, screams masculine, almost Szechuan peppery scent. I like it a lot. Very cold weather/date situationally. 8/10 

- Acqua di Parma Colonia Essenza- smells like a tasty edible lemon and citrus on top of soap. Bar of lemon hotel soap. Nothing special in terms of how it makes me feel personally. Smells like how you would want room spray or hotel to be. 6/10

- Narciso Rodriguez Bleu Noir for Him EDT - wanted to like it. Might be my least favorite fragrance I’ve ever smelled yet. (Still haven’t smelled secretions magnifique) Sprayed it on skin and now I smell the BO smell. Don’t even want to smell it but it does smell woodsy and airy. 2/10

- Montblanc Extreme Leather - supple leather. Very pleasant and not too in your face. Obvious iris/orris note. Flowery. More airy and light than ombré leather but also less longevity and projection. After about an hour was closer to a skin scent 7/10

- TF Ombré Leather - amazing scent but not versatile. Have decided this isn’t for me. The leather new car smell is realistic but it’s just too linear to me and too situational. Every time I breathe in I feel like I can smell it. Very powerful 7.5/10

- PDM Althair - pleasant opening immediately. Smells like a floral orange cake/baked goods. High quality opening, but might not be my style. Very sweet. Airy. Oily residue left behind by the juice on my skin. Marshmallow vanilla undertone. If you don’t  overspray, actually very relaxing. 7.5/10

- Cartier Pasha Parfum - classy fougere, musky, almost funky, smells old timey/vintage to me but just my interpretation. Warm. Inviting. Not exactly feeling like my style when it comes to fougere. Girlfriend said it kind of smells like cheese but I disagree. 7.5 out of 10 but I’m not there yet. 

- Mancera Amorre Cafe - smells like a bakery, too linear and too sweet. Girlfriend thought it smelled feminine. It just smells like a dessert 100%, you could trick me into thinking there’s no cologne and it’s just cooking. If you love gourmands you might love it. I don’t smell the coffee note. 6/10 

- Acqua di Parma Sandalo - simple clean powdery, smells like Vetiver or almost a little bit of a dry grass/hay smell. Definitely lavender, soapiness in there, complex scent that’s difficult to pinpoint notes in. Smells masculine, gentlemanly, and not in-your-face. 7/10

- Givenchy Gentleman Society Extreme - opens with a noticeable nutmeg note. Quickly fades into a soft mix of coffee, vanilla, iris. Wanted to like it based on the note breakdown but underwhelming mass appealing type of designer fragrance, nothing notable or stands out at all. Doesn’t smell offensive, just too safe and unimpressive. 5.5/10

- Guerlain L’homme Ideal EDP - I know people love this fragrance and totally get it, but it’s not for me. It is classy and gentlemanly, but Almost a cherry cough syrup smell to it, not the type of dark cherry I was hoping for. Fizzy opening (hard to describe), nutty almond and warm feel. Alluring and comforting, just not my style - 7.5/10

1omlct7,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1omlct7/him/,Him.,"So, I just started getting into writing and I decided to put down below my first short story. The end goal is to write novels at some point but I'm really just fueling my creative endeavors.

HIM. 

Seated in the living room with an old magazine from my coffee table that’s been sitting there for months, I have my lover’s head placed on my lap carefully combing through his hair with my fingers the way he likes. In the back hums the layered, sultry voice of Sade. I looked to him from my peripheral; unsurprisingly, he’s aimlessly scrolling on his phone, expressionless. 

“Stuck to your screen, huh” I tease, smiling like a Cheshire cat, still combing through his hair. It’s extremely thick; I'm glad he’s growing it out. 

“Yeah, its blazing out right now. I guess this is what we get for craving independence, and peace...” We don’t have the air conditioning on to cut costs. However, he’s right. It’s extremely hot right now, around 98 degrees; too bad we’re trying to save for a home. This is what we get, I guess. We moved from under our drill instructors also known as our parents, they didn't get our love. Called us abominations and exiled us. It's not like we tried to poison King Arthur of Camelot. 

This heat and him on my lap brings back so many memories. All the times we spent together, even how we first met... 

 

I'm doing my weekly forty-hour responsibility of being a waiter, begrudgingly. A random Saturday at 1 or 2, getting tables ready and in comes him. A guy with skin that looks as if it has been marinating in solar energy and a gentleman, he looked like an older interpretation, I presumed it was his father and I was right. The hostess, Shelly, approached them with menus then seats the pair at table seven. 

“The younger one is handsome, isn’t he?” She asks looking at me knowingly and I chuckle not entertaining her too long. 

Now to take my job seriously; I walked up to the table eyeing him from afar. His skin is breathtaking, and the shadows cast down on him making him look like a flickering candlelight. 

“What can I get you guys today?” I ask sparing him a glance; I saw his eyes staring at me intently. 

He starts, “Hey....” pausing right after, examining my name tag. 

“Simeon” he says, I felt my breathing skip. “I’ll have the lasagna and root beer float.” My favorite. 

“Oh, that’s my favorite.” I say as I'm writing his order down catching him staring me down with black pearls that make his presence stand out. Panicking, I turn to his father who was waiting for me to take his order. 

“Great choices guys, your orders will be out shortly.”  

“Thanks...” rolls from his tongue but it feels like he wants to say more. I stand there a moment longer waiting but nothing, so I pivot. Heading to the kitchen, I placed the paper order on the rail for the chefs to queue up and went back to cleaning tables. Every so often I steal glances at table 7, locking my vision on the sunset skinned boy, but only for a moment as to not get caught. 

“Simon the order has been ready for a while now.” My manager from hell says. 

“It's Simeon.” I say with more aggression than usual in my tone. I head to the kitchen retrieving the plates. 

Setting their meals down on their table, I can't help but eavesdrop. 

“You’ve got to hurry and get a girlfriend soon Jeru. I don't want to setup a marriage for you. Your mother really wants grandchildren in the future.” His father says with an aggressive accent, even more so with his tone. 

“I know Papa, I'm just waiting on the right girl...”  He says with a sigh; I can’t help but feel disappointed. I know I didn't have a chance, but this just solidifies the fact. 

“Whenever that is...” He continues. 

I spare him another glance and he’s still staring at me with dark orbs displaying an expression on his face I couldn't describe. 

“Enjoy your meals guys. Let me know if there's anything else I can do.” They thank me and I walk back to my counter deciding to clean down the surface and pastry display. I look up a little while later and there he is at the other side of my counter, gazing at me. Taking me by surprise, we both just stand there for what felt like minutes. 

“Hey, is there something I can help you with?” I ask snapping out of it which made him come back to reality. 

“Uh, yeah...” He fixates his gaze behind me staring at the dessert menu. “Can I get a slice of pecan and a dozen macarons to go?” I nod. 

Sliding my hands into a pair of latex gloves, I open the pastry case and collect his order. The pecan pie is a crowd pleaser. Pecans soaked in simple syrup; they still have their bite, a rich caramel custard filling and a buttery flaky crust that ties everything together. Not to mention the macarons came in various flavors. I decided to add an extra two for him, it won't hurt my demon of a manager if he doesn't know. 

I see his dad walk to the bathroom; he seems to catch wind of that as well. 

“So, why do you work in a restaurant?” He asks oddly trying to make conversation. 

“Well, I need cash, don't I?” I say with a little bit of playful attitude, though, I'm confused at not only the question but the unexpected dialogue. 

“That’s true...” the silence is deafening with us just standing there. Awkwardness made its way into my body replacing the oxygen, it became increasingly difficult to breathe. 

“Can I pay?” he breaks the silence. 

I nod tallying up the amount for everything, “Cash or card?” 

“Card” he hands it to me as his father escapes the bathroom earlier than I wanted him to; it looks like he’s ready to leave. 

Bidding me goodbye he leaves. There goes the guy I thought I'd never see again but moments later he appears again, forgetting the dessert box he paid for. 

“Forgot this...” He says out of breath; I think he ran back, I wondered if he left it on purpose. He looks into my eyes with his opaque ones, whips his head back quickly towards the door, back to me, he wanted to say something, like earlier. 

“You got a pen and paper?” Strange, but I handed it over to him. Scribbling something quick, he hands it back to me, it's his name and number. 

“Jeru,” he says quickly, “short for Jerusalem, text me.” the boy said running back out not “forgetting” the box this time. 

Jeru 

I’m stood there taking everything in, I thought to myself “What happened?” then it clicks. Unfortunately for me, I was unable to text him, Satan spawn himself is obsessed with employees and their phones; I'd have to message him after my shift. 

10pm rolls around, I arrived home greeting my mother as I walked upstairs to my room and took off everything and searching my pockets for anything. Pulling out the paper, remembering the number. I grabbed my phone at light speed, inputting his number quickly. 

Hey. 

I'm stuck, wondering if I should enter with more, my thumb over the send button. My body reacts before my mind and I hit send. 

Hey.  

He responds back almost instantly which runs us into an all-night back and forth... ",1,1762099959.0,writers,1,1.0,False
1omlbvu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee_Shop/comments/1omlbvu/coffee_trailer_power_set_up/,Coffee Trailer Power Set Up,"Good afternoon everyone,

I’m looking to get some advise. I am currently setting up my new coffee trailer business and I’m at the stage of finalising my power setup.

I’m torn between a few options and wanted to get some input from anyone who’s run a mobile trailer or anything similar.

1️⃣ Inverter setup with 2 deep cycle or lithium batteries.
2️⃣ A generator petrol or diesel.
3️⃣ A hybrid system such as a battery setup for lights, fridge, grinder and perhaps generator backup for the espresso machine.

My trailer will be open around 6–7 hours a day. Im thinking of running a dual fuel espresso machine so I can run it off electric or fuel.

I would love to know what power setup that you use or recommend? Any brands you’ve found reliable for inverters, generators, or batteries?

Appreciate any insight! Especially from anyone running a similar operation 🙏

1oml9la,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1oml9la/is_hiding_things_the_same_as_lying/,Is Hiding Things The Same As Lying?,"I have a friend whom I have known for more than twenty years. For much of that time, our relationship was rather casual (we live on different continents) and was confined to holiday cards, occasional emails and rare in-person encounters when either of us was visiting the other's city. About three years ago, we had a long phone conversation that led us both to a surprising mutual forehead-smacking moment when it struck us both how much we had in common yet never realized before.  Thereafter (initiated by him) our conversations - both by text and by phone - became more frequent and gradually more intimate. We opened up to each other; talked about our childhoods, our dreams, our frustrations, our relationships .. the things I always imaged one would talk about with a friend with whom one shared a special bond. That is how my friend described our relationship: a special bond. 

Yes, I do have a point and a question. Please be patient.

I went to visit my friend last spring. I started planning the trip after Christmas and he seemed very enthusiastic about it: He said we'd finally watch together the films we'd discussed, we'd hang out, share a bottle of wine or two. He was especially enthusiastic about road trips since he'd just bought a car. We'd taken rail trips on a previous visit, but he thought the car was better. ""More intimate"" were his words. He even suggested I take apartment rental available within walking distance of his place rather than the tourist area I'd stayed in before. He enthused about being in the same time zone and being able to talk whenever we wished. We'd talk about subjects we never got to during our calls. It sounded great. I imagine we'd be like the modern male versions of Mary Richards and Rhoda Morgenstern for three weeks.

It was nothing like that. 

I arrived in the morning, so my friend offered to let me store my bags at his place (he lives alone - so he says)) until I could check-in at my rental. We spent all of ten minutes there and he never offered anything more than a glass of water. We spent the remainder of the morning and afternoon wandering around the historic center and finally sat down to a cup of coffee (because his budget doesn't allow for dinning out and he doesn't feel comfortable with other people paying - so he says). We picked up my bags, he dropped me at my place and that was the end of day one. I called him around 9PM to thank him for picking me up at the airport and whatnot. He didn't answer, even though he had said ""call me any time"".

Next morning he called and  apologized for not answering; he said he had fallen asleep. He said he was going to walk his dog and would I like to join him. I met him on the street, not at his apartment. This became a routine. Although I enjoyed his company, I thought this was odd. Friends invite friends over for coffee, right? On the day of our first 'road trip' I met him for the dog walk and went back to his place. He had to change and organize the dog, etc. Rather than invite me upstairs for a coffee or to continue our conversation (which I thought would have been natural), he made me wait for twenty-five minutes outside in the cold on a bench. Our day trip was amiable but hardly intimate by any stretch of the imagination - it was like being with a friendly tour guide, not a friend.

We never had lunch, dinner or even drinks together - except on one uncomfortable occasion when I ate while he watched - because he supposedly couldn't afford a meal in a restaurant and would not let me pay. He never invited me to his place. One day, after I'd been grocery shopping and he came by my place (one of two times in three weeks) I said that I would love to prepare a meal for us and he refused. He told me that he cannot eat food prepared by ""random people"" - only by his mother, a family member or a significant other. That hurt like a slap in the face, but I attempted to be understanding.

I never saw any of his friends or family (though I had met his parents twenty years before ) and only spoke briefly to his ex-wife and children (in the park of course) during a traditional historic festival. He had often talked about a good friend and colleague who sounded to me like a fascinating person. I never met her. When I mentioned that I would like to do so, he told met that he'd ""like that, too"" but she was probably out of town. I didn't buy it, but I accepted it.

Anyway, after I returned home from the trip, I began to think about what I had put down to personality quirks and wonder if they were more than that. During my visit, I'd felt as if I were being managed - kept at a distance from his everyday life and experiences. Places, people, everything. It was as if he were hiding something from me or he was hiding me. I looked back on things I had accepted, but now questioned: his calling me only when he was in public - almost never from home - and saying things like ""I have 15 minutes now, if you want to have a brief call"" - even though we used to talk for hours; answering my phone calls to him with a text. I added this to his (to me) oddly restrictive behaviors during my visit and I finally brought them up during a 'public' call. I asked for some explanation but he provided none, just made lame excuses. I hung up.

A few days later, he sent me a text and said he was ""happy that I finally expressed what I feel without reservations' and that he needed to talk at some point but wasn't sure when would be the right time or moment. That was two months ago. We've exchanged a few casual 'acquaintance' texts but have not spoken of anything truly personal since then.

Should I feel lied to, even though he has never 'directly' lied to me? We all hold things back. But when it becomes the status quo of a long relationship is it time to walk away?

### 1. Parse the Odds: The Math of Misery and Milanese Magic

Let’s crunch numbers like a Roman gladiator crushing olives. The odds favor **AC Milan** at **2.25** (implied probability: **44.4%**), while **AS Roma** sits at **3.5–3.75** (**28.6%–26.7%**). The draw? A tidy **3.0–3.06** (**33.3%–32.7%**). On paper, Milan’s home dominance—nine matches unbeaten, including two Coppa Italia shutouts—makes them the pick. But here’s the kicker: Roma’s attack is weaker than a stale cannoli. They’re the third-worst scorer among top-10 teams, relying on defensive tactics so rigid, they’d make a spreadsheet weep. Milan’s offense? Well, they’ve gone nine games without losing, even if recent draws against Pisa (yes, *the* Pisa) and Atalanta suggest they’re as consistent as a clockwork espresso machine… one that occasionally forgets to brew.

**Key stat**: Roma’s “cautious” style means they win most games 1-0. Milan’s defense, meanwhile, has leaked just 0.8 goals per game at home this season. Translation: This could be a low-scoring snoozer unless someone invents a coffee strong enough to wake up Roma’s strikers.

---

### 2. Digest the News: Injuries, Tactics, and Why Roma’s Attack Feels Like a Slow Train

Roma’s recent form is a mixed bag of “meh.” They’re second in the league but with a goal difference so anemic, it’s basically a flatline. Their attack? A glacial crawl. Star man **Tammy Abraham** has just three goals in 10 games—about as prolific as a Milanese tourist avoiding the tourist tax. Meanwhile, Milan’s **Olivier Giroud** (if he’s still around) and **Ante Rebić** have been… well, *present*.

I’m having a hard time choosing between these two grinders and could really use some advice:

* [**Eureka Mignon Zero 65 AP**](https://brewout.fr/products/mignon-zero-65-ap-schwarz?_pos=3&_sid=f7d9106e8&_ss=r)
* [**DF64 Gen 2 (G-iota)**](https://homebarista.be/fr/shop/products/probarista-molen-g-iota-gen-ii-zwart)

I currently have the Eureka on order for **€382 total**, but I can get the DF64 Gen 2 for **€416 total (VAT and shipping included)**, so I’m hesitating before committing.

From what I’ve read, both use **64 mm burrs**, but the **Eureka Mignon line** seems to suffer from **occasional burr misalignment** — sometimes minor, but enough to affect consistency or quality of the burr.  
I don’t really have the time or motivation right now to mess with shimming or calibrating burrs — I just want something that’s **plug-and-play**.

The **DF64 Gen 2** seems to have **better machining and fewer alignment issues**, but honestly, after reading so many threads, I’m at the point where it feels like unless you spend **€700+**, there’s always a bit of a quality lottery when it comes to burr alignment.

My max budget is **€450**, so the **Niche Zero** is off the table (once you add VAT here in France, it gets too expensive).

For context:

* My espresso machine: **Gaggia Classic E24**
* Previous grinder: **Sage Smart Grinder Pro** → decent coffee but **very inconsistent** (high retention, clumping, bad for single dosing)
* Roast preference: **medium to dark**, with some **occasional V60 brews** for higher-end beans
* Taste preference: **clarity over body**, enjoy **fruity notes** when possible

I know this community tends to have high standards (which I love), so I’d really appreciate your insights.  
Honestly, I’d probably be happy with either grinder — but since there’s only a **€40 difference**, I’d rather go for the one that’s more consistent and durable in the long run.

Thanks a ton for any advice 🙏

It reminded me of why I enjoy Haruki Murakami’s writing. His work, almost ubiquitously, evokes that sense of the unseen, the interconnection, channels between untapped wells, the forces beyond us. He delivers plots that engross you in what Miles points out is largely missing from modern cultures.

“The Sweetest Crime (Part I)”

Charles smelled like bourbon and bad decisions the night he met Mercy again. The bar was half-lit and half-empty, the kind of place where regret came cheap and secrets spilled like cheap beer. Mercy was leaning against the jukebox, hips cocked, eyes half-lidded, letting Player’s “Baby Come Back” croon through the static. She didn’t look surprised to see him. She looked ready.

“You Fiona’s man?” she asked, voice dipped in molasses and menace.

Charles blinked, slow and stupid. “You know Fiona?”

Mercy smiled, slow and wicked. “Better than you do.”

That was the beginning.

Charles told himself it was just a slip. A one-time thing. But Mercy didn’t do one-time. She was the kind of woman who made you forget your name and remember your sins. She gave him everything Fiona didn’t—chaos, worship, danger. And Charles, weak and wanting, took it all.

Fiona had changed since Mercy last saw her. Softer, maybe. Her edges dulled by domesticity and the strange comfort of Charles’s arms. She laughed more, wore her hair in a bun, cooked dinner like she believed in tomorrow. Mercy hated it. Hated how Fiona had folded herself into something palatable. Hated how Charles had made her forget the fire.

But Fiona hadn’t forgotten. Not really.

She still walked like she was owed something. Still smoked like it was sacrament. Still had that look in her eye like she’d stolen something and dared you to ask for it back.

Mercy watched from the shadows, waiting.

Then Fiona left town.

A conference in Atlanta. Three days. Charles kissed her goodbye at the train station, told her he’d miss her. Fiona smiled, but her eyes stayed sharp. She didn’t trust easily. Not anymore.

Back at the apartment, Mercy moved in like smoke. She brought wine, candles, and a recipe for shrimp étouffée that made the whole place smell like seduction. Charles was drunk on her before the first bite.

They danced in the kitchen, half-naked and laughing. Mercy wore Fiona’s T-shirt, the one with the faded band logo and the rip at the collar. It hung off her like a dare.

Charles didn’t ask where she got it. He didn’t ask anything.

They made love on Fiona’s couch, under Fiona’s blanket, with Fiona’s ghost watching from the walls.

But ghosts don’t stay quiet.

Fiona got the call halfway through her second panel. A neighbor. Breathless. “Something’s wrong at your place. She’s back.”

Fiona didn’t ask questions. She caught the next train, heart pounding like a war drum.

When she opened the door, the smell hit her first—garlic, butter, betrayal. She dropped her bag and moved fast, boots echoing on hardwood.

Mercy was in the kitchen, barefoot, wearing Fiona’s shirt and a pair of panties that weren’t hers. She turned, slow and smiling, eyes gleaming like polished knives.

“Hey, stranger,” she said, like they were old friends meeting for coffee.

Fiona froze. Her mind screamed break-in, danger, Charles. But her body remembered. Her body burned.

Then Charles appeared, shirtless and stunned, mouth open like a man caught mid-lie.

“Fiona?” he croaked.

Fiona blinked. Her face rearranged itself into heartbreak. She clutched her chest like the pain was new, like she hadn’t seen this coming from a mile away.

“Oh my God Fiona I’m sorry!” Charles asked, voice cracking.

Mercy stepped forward, hips swaying, eyes locked on Fiona. “Tell him,” she whispered.

Fiona swallowed hard. She looked at Charles, then back at Mercy. Her past and present colliding in a kitchen that smelled like sin.

“Tell him the fuck what? I don’t know you bitch!” Fiona said, voice trembling but sharp.

Charles frowned. “But she said y’all were friends in school—”

“She’s lying,” Fiona snapped. “She’s crazy. She’s obsessed. Plus how you trying to refresh my memory and you’re fucking her?!”

Charles stop speaking and just watched intensely. 

Mercy laughed. A low, cruel sound. “You gonna lie to him like you lied to yourself?”

Fiona’s eyes narrowed. “Get out.”

Mercy didn’t move. She leaned against the counter, arms crossed, smile sharp.

“You think you can erase me?” she said. “You think you can bury me under casseroles and Charles’s cologne?”

Charles looked between them, confused and afraid. “What the hell is going on?”

Fiona stepped forward, grabbed Mercy’s arm. “I said get out.” She looked back at Charles. “Don’t ask me no questions, you’re fucking her!”

Mercy leaned in, lips brushing Fiona’s ear. “You miss me.”

Fiona shuddered. Her grip tightened. “I hate you.”

Mercy smiled. “Same thing. Only thing is I never did anything to you. You did it all to me. Used me and discarded me like trash.”

Charles watched, eyes wide. “Fiona… what is she talking about?”

Fiona turned, face blank. “Nothing. She’s delusional.”

Mercy laughed again. “Tell him about the church. About the porch. About the way you begged.”

Fiona’s hand flew, fast and furious. Mercy caught it mid-air, held it there, eyes locked.

“You think you can love a man like Charles and forget what you are?” Mercy whispered. “You think you can scrub me out with soap and silence? You think you can forget the kisses we planted on each other’s bodies and souls?”

Fiona yanked her hand back. “You don’t belong here.”

Mercy stepped back, arms raised. “But I do. I always did.”

Charles looked at Fiona, betrayal blooming in his eyes. “Is it true?”

Fiona didn’t answer. She couldn’t.

Mercy walked to the door, slow and deliberate. She turned, one last time.

“You were the sweetest crime I ever committed,” she said.

Then she was gone.

Fiona stood in the kitchen, heart breaking in three directions. Charles stared at her like she was a stranger. And Fiona, poor Fiona, wondered if Mercy had finally finished her. She didn’t hate Mercy, she hated she had to lie that she did.

Most nights, I’m getting about 7 hours, and I definitely do feel a difference from that to when I get at least 8. I’m so angry and irritated, and what makes matters worse is that my roommate just sleeps and sleeps with no issues and it almost feels like he’s rubbing it in my face (I know, I’m crazy). I also feel like it’s so unbelievably frustrating that I can’t sleep for just one more hour.

Like, nobody needs to be doing all that to sleep normally. I’ve tried literally every single sleep hack out there and it’s made absolutely zero difference.

[""I've known a bunch of minor B-C list celebs. Musicians, Broadway, movies, all of it. One of my very best friends is a C-list working actor. 15-20 years ago, in my younger years, we'd go to parties around Hollywood and run into other C-listers. One of the things that sticks out to me, as a theatre kid myself, is that they are ALL the obnoxious, annoying theatre kids who sang Sondheim in the hallways and had a lot of feelings. They all had that energy. The parties would sometimes get really weird. And deep down, these are not the cool kids. I always remember that when people hold celebs up to these super high standards and take political and life advice from them. They're just people. They're the theatre kid from school, and everyone needs to calm down.""](https://www.buzzfeed.com/aqibspeaks/what-type-of-best-friend-are-you)
2. ""I make movies and TV for a living. There are definitely differences between actors and 'movie stars.' Most actors are just normal, everyday humans that you wouldn't pick out of a crowd. They're usually quirky as hell, but just people. Movie stars tend to have a very specific charisma and a way about them that sets them apart. For example, my boss (who is a producer and has worked with tons of actors at all levels) went to George Clooney's for a meeting and said that it was hard not to feel starstruck because he made you feel like you had his full attention and you were the only one that mattered when he was speaking to you.""
3. ""You'd be surprised at the bad hygiene and bad teeth on a lot of celebs, especially dudes. Also, there are lots of filthy mansions with pets using the floor as a pee pad. A lot of cars, clothes, and houses are borrowed from actual rich people who want proximity to celebrities. I can't emphasize enough how filthy some of these people are — like they've had no home training.""
4. Relatedly..."" Been in LA a long time, known or aquatinted with lots of A-D list peeps, and many of those houses look like a college student's first apartment inside. Like, it's shocking. Also, no concept of money; they'll hand you a hundred-dollar bill for your valet. Having said that, most are really nice golden retriever types who are just blissfully ignorant of the real world. I've only met one or two genuine assholes.""
5. ""The Cyrus family is a lot more normal than people think. I won't go into detail about how I know (out of respect for the family member, a sibling of Miley), but the media really seemed to completely fuck Miley over the years. They are about as down-to-earth and normal as you could get. They each have their quirks, but they aren't the unstable, chaotic family some think they are. They never have been.""
6. ""Just because they worked with other celebs doesn't necessarily mean they were friends with those people. I have one friend who is very famous in his niche section of media. I've been asked, 'What does he say about ____/What does he say ____ is really like' (meaning other famous people he's worked with) for many years. I have to tell people that he doesn't actually talk about those people...at all. He's mentioned a couple of his coworkers who he's close to, but most of them never come up in conversation, and he's not friends with all of them. No one really expects us normies to be besties with people we worked with years ago, but we often assume celebs are BFFs with their costars, and often they just aren't. There may be no feud or bad blood, but they just aren't friends.""
7. ""I used to be neighbors with a lot of actresses, singers, etc. ... Despite their kids never having to work a day in their lives, a lot of them were very anxious parents. Their kids had to take a million special classes, were on weight and exercise regimes in elementary school, and had continuous psychiatric help throughout their lives from toddlerhood, etc. There were a lot of micromanaged kids, but the parents didn't seem mean — just very, very worried. I would've thought they'd have cared less since the kids are automatically semi-famous and obviously rich.""
8. [""I worked for one very long day on Batman Vs Superman. In between takes, my friend and I had a few minutes to talk with Zach Snyder, thanking him for the invite to come be in the film (he'd called into the sports radio station he was listening to locally while in town and offered extra roles to people at the station…I'm just the lucky friend of one). It wasn't like we knew the guy or anything, but for a few minutes, we were just chopping it up with another guy about sports…right after walking by the goddamned Batcave set! In hindsight, we both felt like maybe it wasn't so acceptable for a couple of extras to grab the director of a big-budget movie during a night shoot and just attempt to chit-chat with the guy, but he never made us feel like we were out of line or bugging him. He seemed genuinely happy we'd taken him up on the offer…and I even made it in the movie for like 1.2 seconds.""](https://www.buzzfeed.com/anthonyorlando52/iconic-duos)
9. ""People really need to stop pretending like celebrities are the personas they portray on red carpets, in interviews, etc. Most of the actors I've worked with are noticeably different from how they behave in the public sphere, and it's not necessarily a bad thing. It's normal to not want to share every part of yourself with the public. A lot of them are a lot more weird, introverted, etc. than you would think based on their public appearances. I just hate when people see videos of their favorite celeb and think they know them cause they were kooky on an episode of Hot Ones. The truth is they're still usually playing a version of themselves.""
10. [For example...""Owen Wilson is one of the most introverted people I've ever met. He turns it ON for the camera and then goes to his chair and totally keeps to himself. He's not rude by any stretch, but just very, very introverted and quiet.""](https://www.buzzfeed.com/michelelbird/hulu-summer-2025-movies)
11. ""A ton of athletes smoked weed before it was taken off the banned substances list in most leagues (and a good amount do harder shit as well). The guys who got caught were just dumb about it.""
12. ""I bartended in NYC for years, mostly in pretty humble, unpretentious bars (nothing I'd really classify as a dive). One bar in the East Village would get celebrity customers pretty often, probably because of its location and because it is a dark little place that would allow someone to go under the radar. The most striking thing to me was how goddamn awkward they tended to be. Like, they seemed so unsure of how to speak normally to a non-famous person. Often, I wouldn't even recognize them as celebrities until I interacted with them. They'd behave so awkwardly that I'd carefully look at the name on their card to find out who they were, and only then would the penny drop (or after some discreet googling). I can understand why they're like this, by the way. It's just funny how un-smooth many of these people act when they have such a cool public persona.""
13. [""I've known Jack Antonoff since before his big come-up, and he is genuinely one of the nicest, kindest, most hard-working people in the industry. He is truly a really, really good guy who deserves all of his success. I don't love every person he's worked with, and I wish he would disconnect from some of the...not as good people, but he really is the best.""](https://www.buzzfeed.com/mariasherm2/lorde-butt-solar-power-album-cover-story)
14. ""They are all frozen at the age they became famous. Christina Aguilera was always a 13-year-old girl. Adam Levine is a horny 18-year-old guy. Robin Williams was a hilarious and kind 25-year-old. etc…I think after you are famous, the systems around you stop saying 'no,' and stop supporting/disciplining you like they probably should. So, continuing to mature on the same path as normal people becomes harder. I never had a 'bad' experience with the celebs I worked with, and many I would say were friends, but my interactions were never totally in line with the 'regular' folks I really spent my quality time with.""
15. ""I worked at a large celebrity PR agency in New York City. I feel like it could go either way — you have someone who is really great and grounded, or you have someone who is a complete nightmare and disaster. I had 12 celebrity clients I had to juggle. Some of these clients ranged from an A-list Stranger Things actor to a talk show host, and I learned a lot about the industry and how these people literally wear masks and know exactly how to display themselves on camera so that people will eat it up. ... It's wild to really see it happen in real-time. One celebrity, in particular, was a literal nightmare and one of the most insufferable women I have ever met. People in the United States LOVE her; she's basically America's sweetheart. She would not make eye contact with me, would not speak to me, and spoke to her assistant in front of me directly about what she wanted to communicate with me while I was RIGHT IN THE ROOM.""
16. ""One of my husband's best friends worked for Tommy Lee Jones on his cattle/polo ranch near San Saba. As I understand it, Jones is known in Hollywood for being a bit of a jerk. But my husband's friend said that TLJ is very reserved and private and honestly pretty socially awkward. He doesn't like to talk about himself at all but will happily discuss cattle breeds or what kind of polo saddle is best. His opinion is TLJ's awkwardness is what's given him his reputation.""
17. ""The B/C listers are the worst to work with.""
18. Specifically...""As someone who lives in Vancouver, I can confirm there is almost nobody worse than a C (and maybe temporarily B, if they're lucky) list CW actor. A few of them are truly great people who treat the crew and locals great. But the majority of them are awful — I'm saying this from my and my family's experiences working on set for the duration of the shows. In contrast, most of the A-listers I've met or my family has worked with have been incredible, genuine, and down to earth. They treated cast, crew, and locals miles better than C listers.""
19. In contrast...""Not me but a friend of mine worked on the set of Queen Charlotte (the Bridgerton series on Netflix). Had nothing but great things to say about the cast. She especially loved India [Amarteifio] (the lead actress). India was only about 20, I think, while filming, but she said she was so professional, kind, hardworking, and just an overall joy. My friend is in her late 20s. She said what she found super funny was that several of the male extras had the biggest crush on India, and it was like she was oblivious to it. She was probably just so focused on her work, and it was a lot of pressure leading a multimillion-dollar production, but I just found that funny. Stars…they can be clueless just like us.""
20. ""A lot of them are so insecure. There's one actor I worked with who is ADORED throughout their very fervent fandom. I met them at a season launch party, and while the party was ongoing, this one actor was schmoozing and gregarious and putting on the charisma. As soon as the party ended, he dropped the big smile and kept voicing complaint after complaint to his entourage. He kept trying to smell his own breath and was deeply concerned the garlic in the Caesar salad he had eaten was giving him bad breath, so he started breathing in the faces of all the folks in his entourage and asking everyone if his breath smelled okay.""
21. ""I went to college with a few nepo babies. Behavior ranged from typical wealthy apathy/cluelessness to actively trying to buy off people to keep their secrets. The one with the most famous parent was the most low-key and very kind.""
22. ""Will.i.am (black-eyed peas) is an extremely genuine person. He's wholesome, thoughtful, caring, and full of empathy. He doesn't have a mind for business, really; the people advising him lead him down the wrong path ethically. Personality: he is like a step below Bob Ross, Keanu, Steve Irwin, etc; not quite as wholesome, but he's up there.""
23. ""A lot of the men are very horny. I used to talk to this male actor from a Hulu show, and he was always snapping me during his sex parties. But anyways, yeah, he was always horny. They just have to hide it better. He first started talking to me after I messaged him on Instagram and told him I was a fan. He DMed me off a throwaway Instagram and added me on a throwaway snap.""
24. ""Kiss and intimate scenes (I know you want to know): it is true that it's not a romantic setting, and while some actors will switch on/off like that, others will joke around in a flirtatious way with their partner during the whole shoot, and that's very weird knowing they have a wife/husband at home.""
25. ""My parents used to work for one of the companies that supply Super Bowl memorabilia, and they got to meet Gisele Bundchen this way. She brought her kids to the booth where they were working before the game started so they could pick something out. The company's rep tried to give them everything, but she insisted on paying. My dad said she was very sweet and soft-spoken until a reporter caught up to her and started grilling her about Tom Brady. Her security was trying to get him to leave without putting his hands on him, and he was being rude. She flipped a switch and yelled at him that Brady was just one person on an entire team, that he worked very hard, and they needed to stop expecting him to do everything. As soon as the security team hauled the reporter off, she went back to sweet and kind person. My dad said it was like Jekyll and Hyde.""
26. ""Not me, but a close friend of mine was a nanny for a celebrity — she told me that the celebrity woman was very lonely and didn't feel she could trust anyone. Once she trusted the nanny enough, she actually hired another nanny to take care of her kids and kept my friend as a 'nanny' but really just to keep her around as a friend. It was very sad.""
27. ""I worked for the first time with a major A-List talent many years ago when I was first starting out. They (trying to remain gender neutral so as not to give too much away) have quite the reputation for being phenomenally talented but also rude, abrasive, and arrogant.""
28. ""I was close friends with one of Ewan Mcgregor's kids in high school, and Ewan is the loveliest man ever. So sweet, down-to-earth, and engaging. I remember being intimidated the first time I went to her house, but both of her parents couldn't have been any nicer!!!""
29. ""Most of them are super small (short, thin, large heads), extremely insecure, and weirdly socially inept. It's like being 'on' all the time has made them incapable of acting like regular, relaxed people. I can’t really explain it. Other observations...""
30. ""You know how you meet a really, really dumb person, and they somehow end up incredibly smart about one specific thing? That's how I would describe a lot of actors. Since they don't have in-depth education but were educated on sets or by part-time tutors, they just come off as…kind of dumb. This is a huge generalization, but I never really got the feeling that a lot of them were 'intellectuals,' if you know what I mean. That being said, I met a few actors who were genuinely charismatic and appreciative of BG and the crew. I remember Sacha Baron Cohen was that kind of guy. He was genuinely very nice and pleasant.""
31. ""I dated someone who was barely C-list. He had been a TV personality since he was 15. He had zero accountability; all of his 'friends' were financial benefactors or ultra-wealthy. It was hard to be around someone who didn't understand that buying me expensive gifts didn't gloss over our issues. Truthfully, I feel bad for him. Even as little known as he was, we couldn't go anywhere without being interrupted. Within weeks of our breakup, a few of his best friends were shooting their shot.""
32. ""I've worked in Nashville, primarily in the music industry, since I was 18. I've done everything from being a runner who just gets coffee and does dry cleaning for the talent to being a hired gun who plays on a record (a SMALL record). But I have the benefit of having worked with big names in country and rock music. I can only speak for who I've worked with, so here's the skinny on all of 'em…Jack White is taller in person than you would think and is very down to earth. Loved spending time with him. Same with Jelly Roll. Looks can be deceiving, but he was a surprisingly intelligent fella who even invited me to golf with him. ... Probably the biggest name I ever worked for was Garth Brooks.""
33. ""These people I'm going to talk about are all pretty much dead, but what the hell? In college and right after, I worked at a famous sporting event that would attract a bunch of celebrities. James Garner was a total charmer and had zero airs about him. He joked around a lot but also asked you questions. I think he was not really wealthy because any time people said they liked something, he'd joke that he should have asked for more money.""
34. ""I've met a fair number of musicians, but probably the nicest was Weird Al. My daughter was shy but really wanted his autograph, and he was so kind! I understood why the line (after a show) was so slow. He took time with each person, made a little personal connection, and left them feeling seen and heard. It was honestly amazing.""
35. ""Many of them have really different natural voices from what you hear on camera. Reeeeaaally different.""
36. ""They REALLY look like that. From Victoria Secret supermodels, to A-list actors, to Grammy-winning musicians — they truly look that good. Yeah, I definitely had to catch my breath once or twice.""
37. Specifically...""Lee Pace is fucking beautiful in real life. Like jaw dropping, head turning, drop dead gorgeous. Lee Pace, if you're reading this, I apologize for gasping loudly and rudely staring at you that spring a couple of years ago. I'm genuinely sorry, but I couldn't help it because you stood out (it doesn't help you're so tall, too). 😭""
38. ""I work in TV, and I would just say, in general, that there is usually not any relationship between the character a person plays and how they actually are in real life. Sure, sometimes you get a writer-actor who is writing themselves, or maybe a really famous person who has a lot of control over the script, but that's not common. In general, they are their own distinct personalities who get a script written by a completely different set of humans. I know it's easy to feel like you know them or understand their relationship with their castmates, but you just don't. They are strangers you do not know.""
39. And finally...""Ye is exactly what you'd expect.""

1omky6k,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/1omky6k/aita/,AITA,"I am a 48-year-old female. Last year, as a 47-year-old, I started seeing a band that had the exact same age. 

Backstory- 48 female, history of family, trauma, and abuse, long-term relationship, trauma and abuse. Extensively since early childhood. 

When meeting this man, we were pretty okay, at least by my standards, often, and for the first few months, until there was a significant event that I had to call the local police in. Also, yes, there were incidences of multiple heated exchanges in conversation that just regulate me to a point where I am extremely unsettled and need my space and my distance because I cannot communicate with this person when they get to a certain level. So yes, I do shut down and close out. It’s like you need to back off and you need to leave me alone. I am not comfortable. And in these situations, this person will want to express their opinions and everything else.

So we were in the process of trying to do a reset on our relationship because there is a lot of chemistry. There are a lot of things that we both enjoy about the other person. 

So last evening we went out had dinner somewhere came home and he already knows I’ve had some extremely severe medical issues. The man has been to doctor appointments with me and he’s even heard a specialist talking about my sense of medical condition that which is absolutely one of the most severe cases many of these medical doctors who practice in the specialized field have ever seen..

So back to dinner we got home we’re sitting down. He sees a Reddit thread specifically on how women should treat their man to show their love and how people show love to their partner.  So then this became another thing where he’s shoving something down my throat in my face read this read this let’s discuss this. You don’t do this. You don’t do that. You don’t do this, but I do this and I do this and I do this and you don’t do this.  Yes, so it’s late at night by this point we got home around eight thirtyish. It’s now around 9:30 all the way straight till nearly 11. So yeah by this point, I’m completely stressed out. I’m tired of being told how to express myself how to show up in the relationship and I’ve told this person flat off that if you don’t like the way I am then leave. Leave and leave me alone.

I’ve told this person I only care to do these things organically like I have to feel it to do it and if you don’t like the way, I am then you need to stop trying to reprogram me to be your perfect person. This person seems to have a problem with me being a very independent person and just likes to micromanage and go through everything about my personality and the life that I live.

Fast forward today we wake up and I get dressed and I get ready. I leave my house. I asked this person to leave my house before I come home. And I have been told by this person straight out that they will not leave that I have supposedly wasted a year of their life and so they don’t care even if I don’t come home they say they will wait an entire week person even threatened to get on top of the roof of my vehicle when I’m leaving my house to go get my iced coffee.  

Yes, this man is on the dating over 40 threads and he even knows this is my profile so he knows this is my post.

So even ignoring my phone calls when I have left my house to get my coffee and now I’m sitting in some random parking lot and my town is not even able to go back to my house.

Yes, you are not a gentleman and yes, you are like every other fucking man that you seem to think you are better than

I’d glance at the clock at work — 11:42 a.m. — blink, and it would suddenly be 2:17 p.m. My coffee was cold, my emails were answered, and I’d have no memory of doing any of it.

At first, I blamed exhaustion. Too much stress, too many sleepless nights. But it kept happening. At home, too. I’d be cooking dinner, and then I’d blink — and the food would be gone, the dishes washed, my kids already in bed.

When I finally told my mom, she said, “You’re probably just zoning out again.”
But when I checked my phone, I noticed something strange — every time I “lost time,” I had new photos in my gallery. Pictures of me. Smiling. In places I don’t remember visiting.

This morning, it happened again. I blinked, and it was dark outside. Except this time, there was a message on my mirror written in condensation:

Stop watching me when I’m in control.

I think I’m the one skipping time.
But if that’s true… who’s the one that’s awake when I’m gone?

‍

**Why This Pick?**

‍

The Colts have racked up 31+ points and covered the spread in each of their last 4 games, and while their offense is on fire, their defense is just a tad less efficient. I expect the Steelers to put at least 2 TDs on the board today (hell, even the struggling Tennessee Titans managed that over the Colts last week!) but I also anticipate Indianapolis will make at least 4 successful trips to the end zone. With the Steelers having put at least 23 points on the board in each of their last 4 outings and the Colts having cashed the Over in 7 of their last 8 games, I’ve gotta roll with a high-scoring affair here.

I have all the luxuries like games, movies, food, a decent setup, but everything just feels useless. Even things I used to enjoy feel undoable.

After a few long chats with ChatGPT, I realised it all started after I began working from home. Back when I had an office job, my day felt full.
Saying hi to colleagues. Random talks and jokes. Calling my girlfriend in the morning. Complaining about work with friends. Meeting her after office.
All those little things made life feel alive without me even noticing it.

Now with WFH, all those small social touches are gone. The day starts and ends in the same room. Even gaming or watching something doesn’t hit the same because there’s no one to share it with. I’m thinking of trying online games where people chat casually while playing, maybe it’ll bring a bit of that lost social energy back.

Also, just stepping out helps more than I expected. Riding my bike, sitting in a coffee shop, or simply being outside for more than 30 minutes breaks the loop. Makes me feel like the world’s still moving and I’m part of it.

Still trying to figure it out though. If you’ve felt this kind of emptiness and found something that helps, I’d really like to know.",1,1762098816.0,selfimprovement,2,1.0,False

1omksi1,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1omksi1/new_person_but_thoughts_of_my_ex_popping_up/,New person but thoughts of my ex popping up,"I broke up with my ex after 3 years of a long distance relationship. The break up was due to life circumstances where we couldn’t fulfill each other’s needs from afar, and we couldn’t move to each other’s countries.

At first, I was miserable because they were my first real love, but with time and processing my thoughts, I realized that there were elements of the relationship that weren’t as healthy as I thought and made peace with the break up. I am content being by myself, go to the gym and have a good network of family and friends (since it was a long distance relationship, I wasn’t dependent on my partner for companionship, even though we talked and texted every day).

Recently, someone asked me out. I let them know about my recent break up, and they said not a problem and to take my time. We have been meeting for coffee to get to know each other better. Feelings of excitement to explore a new relationship are coming back, but suddenly I’ve been thinking about my ex more, or something the new person said will remind me of my ex. I don’t feel guilty for moving on nor want to get back together with my ex, but I can’t help memories from popping up.

i drink a lot of energy drinks, but for a while i had been off of them because i knew they weren’t doing me any actual good. the week or so before the week i’m talking about i think i had started back up though, but only one energy drink every couple days. but then, i went on a job where we were working 18 hour shifts for about 8 days and i was on the job with this coworker who loves energy drinks and would bring cases of them in the coolers, and long story short i was drinking 2-3 energy drinks a day along with a mcdonald’s coffee. i was also eating insanely greasy foods on the daily because we were on perdiem and everyday before driving to the fire we would stop at a fast food joint, and everyday after we left we would stop at one too. plus the lunches we were given were often also fast food. then, the night before my symptoms came on, i drank a lot of alcohol to celebrate finally being off this job. 

could i have overwhelmed my poor gut so badly i developed gastritis or ulcers or some other shit overnight? i’m off caffeine and have been eating fairly blandly and haven’t drank any alcohol. still not feeling better really at all, but i haven’t really treated it whatsoever because i want to wait until after my endoscopy.

Wondering if there’s any more that yall can share. Also looking for any recommendations on easy-clean-up cooking appliances.

Current appliances:
-fridge
-microwave (with air fryer and oven function)
-butane stove (does anyone know if I can safely use this inside the truck?)
-propane grill
-electric stove (overpowered for the truck—can’t really use with current inverter)
-small rice cooker
-coffee maker

Generally my meals are rice with veggies and beans, sometimes I do a frittata or “pancake” with a ton of veggies thrown in. Think basically veggie bread. It’s surprisingly good, and can cook in the rice cooker.
Been kinda stuck on rice bowls recently, plus it’s getting colder out so I don’t really want to pull out the grill as much. Any suggestions are welcome, no dietary restrictions and not worried about weight but I’m trying to keep it healthy and don’t like sweet stuff too much.

- good for young families, lots of greenery if possible
- need stuff going on, such as coffee shops, restaurants and pubs. Generally things to do as we are coming from London where there's always stuff to happening. Would love a decent nightlife closeish by (sadly clubbing days are behind us though so that is less important)
- decent public transport connections down to London for work (Stockport maybe?), Manchester centre and, to a lesser extent, towards Liverpool (family that way)
- a nice to have would be generally pretty/ period properties and a community atmosphere 
- get away with minimal driving/ reliant on public transport

Curled up together on the old sofa

warming our palms as we talked of         
nothing at all.                                             
Everything felt so normal —                     
as if the years had folded away                
since the last time we held each              other.  
For a moment I forgot you were gone.

like you were about to tell me

I knew right then:                                      
I was dreaming —                                     
I wanted to hold you,

were still with me.

1omko7p,https://v.redd.it/64n0j1497vyf1,Coffee bean wine,"I made a coffee wine from Arabica beans following Jack Kelley’s recipe.

Adjusted for what my carbon size the recipe is
141g fresh ground beans
701g brown sugar 
4.7g acid blend
0.7g tannin 
2650ml water 
3.1g DAP
3g 71b yeast 

Started off by putting the water on medium heat. Added the brown sugar until dissolved and then added the ground coffee. Slowly stirred until it boiled then took it off heat and let go to room temp. Ran it through muslin cloth a few times. pH came to 4.2 and after the acid blend down to 3.4. Added my tannin and DAP. The brix was around 21.9 at that point. Then hydrated my yeast and added some of the must in but by bit before inoculating. Decided against adding any PMS and cold settling then racking before ferment as I wasn’t really that invested.

It started bubbling within an hour. It was staying in a room that stays at 18c, thats the best I could do but I would prefer colder. Measured in 24hours later and it was down to 20 brix. Bit of foam on the top that was pushing through the airlock so had to scrape that off and pour some out for more headroom. Taste was nice, really well balanced actually.

24 hours later and it had gone nuts, down to 15 brix. Taste was still good but I was really hoping it would slow down. Did a grape ferment last year where the yeast went nuts and it gave off some very eggy/cabbage sulphur smells.

24 hours later and it knew from the smell when I walked in the room. Down to 5 brix. Taste isn’t bad to be honest. The tannin is poking through more now, i think the acid is mildly out of balance. There’s a bitterness coming in which I actually like because it’s supposed to be a coffee wine right. Lacking a bit of body but not too bad.

I suspect it will be done tomorrow at this rate. I’ll kill with some PMS and potassium sorbate. Put it in the fridge to cold settle and sit on lees for a few days. I’ve got some mildly toasted American oak chips arriving tomorrow which I’ll let sit in there till Im happy with the taste. 

When I’m happy with the taste I’ll bench trial some bento and find a clarity i like.

Overall actually pretty good. Next time I would probably knock back the DAP a bit and reduce the acid by about 10-20%. I want it to ferment slower, I need to look into a cooling jacket so I can do it at around 12-14.",6,1762098409.0,winemaking,3,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).

For the privacy-conscious, I think the prevailing wisdom is that driving an older car (that doesn't have any associated apps on your phone, dashboard driver monitoring systems, or internal cameras/sensors to collect data that can be exploited) shields drivers from some of this data collection and insurance surveillance.  
  
What features/systems exist in the 6th 4Runner that participate in this surveillance (if any?) I'm trying to get a sense of just how deep the 6th Gen plays in this regard.

Caveat: I KNOW our phones track us, and that there are lots of other ways we are surveilled. I know we live in a surveillance world and the car is the lease of our worries.

1omkd9f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tekken/comments/1omkd9f/the_series_would_benefit_immensely_from_another/,The series would benefit immensely from another time skip," There's a 20 year time skip between Tekken 2 and 3, and since then, the time elapsed amounts to about 1 year. It's really imbalanced and makes the whole story feel a bit redundant, so I think they would be smart in Tekken 9 to do another time skip, at least 10 or 15 years. Bamco could really shake things up and even solve some stylistic issues with the series currently. No one really gets old or frail in these games, so you can age everyone up. 

\- The Devil gene is completely gone, but for Reina. With Claudio and Zafina dead and Clive in hell, she remains the only supernatural force in the game and is thus a formidable villain. Everyone else is pure martial arts. 

\- Jin essentially becomes the new Kaz, the ageing tech-lord honing his craft. 

\- Kazua spends the game in redemption rehab with Jun, taking a long break like in Tekken 3. 

\- As with 3, new characters can actually feel fresh, like the next generation threatening the norm. Jin, Xiaoyu, Hwoarang and Eddy were all new kidz once.

\- Heihachi fucking dies from botched hair implants or something. I dunno. Put him in a cave somewhere.

\- Unmask King. Another orphan can take up the Jaguar mask which is getting real stinky by this point.

\- Finally, finally give Asuka some attention. 

\- Leroy gets elected president of the United States.

\- Law and Paul go into a civil partnership and officially become the Statler and Walforf of Tekken. 

\- Lili is finally legal, and 95% of the player base is finally off the hook. Maybe she inherits her father's oil empire to become a contender against G-Corp, or maybe she becomes a privileged activist or something. 

\- Anna and Nina are now in their 40s and actually fit their deadly real housewives personas. 

\- Jack units are out of commission, and all new models now function as exoskeletons for the bears who are now so old they can hardly move.

\- Alissa's upgrades have stopped. She's been getting rusty and malfunctioning, making her gameplay even more chaotic.

\- Similarly, Bryan's body has started to decay, making him more ghoulish and evil than ever. 

\- Keep Azucena. Her coffee enterprise has expanded to dominate all of south America. She is the most brutal and despised villain this series has ever known. 



Those are all the ideas I've got. I just think it would be fun to embrace the fact this series is old as hell now, taking it back to the basics while also pushing it forward.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

I am going through what I can only describe as the worst living pain I have ever experienced, to the point where I am severely depressed for the first time in my life.

I'm a 38M from south east England. Working professional running a few businesses in IT so for many years it afforded me a comfortable lifestyle but at the expense of long working hours. My wife is a 35F home educator for our 2 boys.

Met my wife in 2013, we lived together for 11 years and then got married - married 1 year so far so all in all we've been together for 12 years now but only married in the last year.

Our relationship was relatively good and stable, BUT, it wasn't perfect, I worked too many hours and she homeschooled the children so we didn't have as much time for eachother as we'd have liked but things were generally good (holidays, days out, family time etc).

But, something happened in August that has absolutely decimated my life and taken me from a happy go lucky hardworking professional to a suicidal shell.

On the night of 1st August 2025, me, my wife, our two boys and our little dog Chloe went to my mum’s for fish and chips. Chloe had been a bit off for a few weeks but nothing serious. That night, she suddenly started having seizures. We rushed her to the emergency vets. They kept her in overnight, saying they’d sedated her and were monitoring her.

At around 7:30 the next morning, my wife came downstairs in tears and told me the words that will haunt me forever: “She’s been seizing all night. She’s paralysed. She’s on oxygen. She needs to be put to sleep.” I had a massive panic attack and I was unable to stop it so I went to the kitchen and drank quarter of a bottle of pink gin. It was the only way I could stop the panic attack (I suffered long running anxiety and managed it relatively well until this day)

We all went together to the vets as we couldnt find anyone to have the kids. We got to the vets, the kids went into the waiting area and me and my wife went into the consult room. Our dog was laying in an oxygen chamber, we were told she'd been seizuring all night and lost use of her limbs and needed oxygen to stay alive so it was time to say good. I looked at her and told her I would take her for a walkies when she got better, she looked at me for the last time and somehow wagged her tail. In that moment of pure panic and heartbreak, I lost control. I tried to leave the room to stop myself making a scene,  but the room was tiny, and as I rushed for the door, I pushed past my wife. It wasn’t deliberate, I just needed to get out. That split second changed everything.

That one act of barging past my wife trying to flee the room lead to the vets reporting it to the police as domestic violence (without injury).

Outside, I was sobbing, screaming that I wished I was dead. I wasn’t violent or threatening anyone,  I was just in shock. Staff called the police out of concern. They later found me walking down the road, calmed me down and took me to my mum’s, saying it was a welfare issue. There was no arrest, no charges, just a broken man who’d lost his dog and lost control.

I should have stayed there quietly and grieved. Instead, over the next few days, everything fell apart. I was lost, guilt-ridden, barely sleeping. I walked for miles, talked to strangers, slept in a hedge one night, and was later reported missing. The police found me safe the next morning, sat me down for a coffee, and reunited me with my wife and kids briefly. She told me to stay with my mum for now and get help. She was calm and kind, said we’d talk, and we stayed in touch over WhatsApp.

Over the next couple of weeks, things were mixed. My wife was caring to a degree, she sent some positive things over whatsapp and filled me with hope that it would just be 2-3 weeks and then I could go home. But, this soon changed. We had a bit of mixed conversations sometimes she was ok, others cold. The idea was I would stay away for a few weeks, get some counselling and grieve / heal before going home.

Then everything just flipped. Around the third week of August, she suddenly blocked me on WhatsApp. One minute we were talking about progress, the next,  single grey tick, no profile photo. Then I noticed she’d blocked me on Facebook too. I panicked, called friends, tried to understand what I’d done wrong. I’d been messaging calmly, showing her I was doing therapy, making progress, even apologising for everything. Then,  silence.

3 weeks later (after agonising silence from being blocked with no answers), I got served with a non-molestation order. Out of nowhere. A one-year order banning me from all contact with my wife and children. I couldn’t message, call, or even share photos of the boys online. Reading her witness statement broke me,  it portrayed me as something I’m not. I’m not violent, not abusive, not dangerous. I was a man who fell apart in grief. At the same time she also applied for an occupation order.

At the time the statement was written (15th August), she was still messaging me kindly. That’s what destroyed me most,  the mixed signals. One version of her was compassionate and encouraging; the other, in the paperwork, made me out to be a threat.  The witness statement had some horrible stuff in it, much of which wasn't true - the thing is, it didnt look or read like something my wife would have written, it was honestly heartbreaking to read.

The thing is - she literally cut me off, blocked my family - all out of the blue.

Since then, I’ve been completely cut off. I’ve kept paying the mortgage, bills and £2k a month to support them, but I’ve been homeless,  living between my parents’ sofa and spare room. I haven’t seen my boys in three months. I’ve stayed sober since August, I’m in therapy four times a week, and I’m working to rebuild everything,  myself, my business, my mental health.

At the return hearing in October, I asked to reduce the order to six months and allow limited WhatsApp contact about the kids. My wife refused. The court kept it at 12 months. She cried during the hearing,  I could see she was in pain too,  but still said no.

I was briefly told by 1 friend who was in contact with her that child/social services got involved and that she didnt want this order but her arm was forced basically - she kept mentioning ""child services"" and ""other agencies"" - but the thing that makes no sense is that I've NEVER been contacted by any agencies?

(I've since filed a SAR with child services / council for a copy of any data held against me) and filed a seperate SAR with the council for any information held on my boys.

Now I live in limbo. No closure, no contact, no idea what she feels or thinks. I don’t even know if she still loves me, or if this is just the system keeping us apart. Everything about it feels wrong,  like one emotional breakdown has cost me my entire life.

Since she blocked me - even though I've done NOTHING wrong, she's gotten worse - she was speaking with a mutual friend who acted as a go-between indirectly but, she blocked him when she found out he'd been relaying to me.

She tells people one thing but does another? after the court hearing (Return hearing) she rang my friend upset saying she feels awful and that she hopes she can drop the order in 6 months? But then she goes and blocks him for relaying anything to me?

She blocked my business partner for no reason, unblocked him and then blocked him again after sending him a nice message apologising for blocking him saying ""it all got a bit much"".

She's living her life, she's out with the kids sharing photos on social media (I cannot see I am blocked but I have been told) - she's in the house, all bills paid, mortgage paid, everything paid and she gets £2k a month whilst I literally am falling to pieces over the mental torture.

It's destroying me - it's literally driving me to breaking point - because I have no answers, nothing.

One minute we are living together, kids, living life and then boom - blocked, barred and locked out with court orders - no idea if we are together anymore, no idea if there's a future and I've gotten to the point where 3 months of this has destroyed me - I don't think I can go another month before I break.

The thing is, I don't know if I cut her off financially and file for divorce whether that will be a wake up call or whether it will ultimately end the marriage - I have no idea what to do.

I was contemplating giving it 6 months and applying for an order variation in February to see if she would accept a reduction and then using that as the decision point for divorce.

I've heard a voice note from her to one of my friends saying she wanted me away for 12 months to sort my head out, and that she needs to be ABSOLUTELY certain that I am stable mentally and emotionally before I come home, that's why she rejected the 6 month variation request at the return hearing - but, in reality I cannot see this being viable.

Being honest - I had faults, I worked too many hours, was often tired and not as engaging as a father as I could be (I still did bedtimes, spent some time with them, went days out), I would drink a few beers on a wednesday, friday and saturday night but never got drunk, and I had an underlying anger issue with my work / PC at home, I would shout at the PC or get angry with it - there was never any violence or aggression towards my family but I used to get pissed with the computer/things crashing/losing clients and Id shout, bang the keyboard - but, again, I accepted this was an issue and have been in therapy/counselling for it - a lot of the issues were down to sleep deprivation.

My wife hasn't worked in the 12 years we've been together, we are a single income family. She took the 2 boys out of school last year and began homeschooling - so she now is classed as a full time home-educator.

I had a tough 2024 into 2025 with AI causing a lot of disruption to my business, all my businesses saw financial downturn whilst all my bills and costs went up, so I was stressed and exhausted - but I did my best for my little family.

I’m not a bad man. I made mistakes, absolutely. But I’ve owned them, fixed what caused them, and stayed accountable. I’ve done everything right since that day. Yet I’m stuck, alone, unsure if time will heal this or just quietly erase everything I loved.

IS THERE ANY WAY I CAN SAVE THIS MARRIAGE?

Do you think there is any hope or things I could potentially do?

  
She hasn't divorced me, she never told me it was over, on her witness statement she stated ""the relationship is not officially over""  - so I don't know.

Do I just get on with life and wait it out to see if things change?

Or am I holding on to false hope?

  


**TL;DR:**  
Our dog died suddenly in August. I broke down at the vet, panicked, and pushed past my wife trying to leave the room. Police got involved as a welfare issue. Weeks later, despite me getting therapy and staying sober, my wife blocked me on everything and filed a one-year non-molestation order. I’ve not seen my wife or kids since. I’ve fixed everything I can, but I’m left in limbo with no closure or contact  just pain and hope that maybe one day, this gets resolved.",0,1762097443.0,marriageadvice,3,0.33,False

1omk8r9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIO/comments/1omk8r9/aio_i_dont_like_my_nephews_bf/,AIO: I don’t like my nephew’s BF,"Several months ago I made a post on here saying how my nephew’s grades and his overall academics have been dwindling down due to his new BF. Now I come to you again seeking advice as something new has happened that I personally don’t know how to handle it. 

My nephew’s BF invited him to a Halloween party, now I don’t know what type of friends this young man has. I don’t have a good impression of him let alone his friends, besides I feel like nowadays the only thing kids do is drink do drugs and have sex. So I immediately said no. Back in my days, I was born in the 80’s, we’d be trick-or-treating but I guess that’s not cool anymore. Given that it was also the boy’s birthday I permitted him to spend the night for as long as he slept **in the living room** they could watch a couple of scary movies but after midnight they needed to go to sleep. 

The evening was more or less normal I bought a cake and we celebrated his birthday here they watched a few movies and I thought the night would end uneventful. But my rules must mean shit in my household because that boy not only had the audacity to sleep in my nephews bedroom but he was shamelessly loud. Now no one prepares you for this. When I woke up I was in denial, I thought they were goofing off and I immediately went to the living room to find no one there. My suspicions were confirmed when I found the door to his bedroom locked. Like I said no one prepares you for this type of situation. There’s no manual or a how to go about it. Part of me wanted to kick the door open but I also didn’t want to catch him in *the act*. So I decided I didn’t want to cause a scene and left.

In the morning I asked the BF to leave and I pulled my nephew to the side for a talk. This was the first time he has ever talked back to me and it was hard not to raise my hand and slap him. Like I’ve said before after my brother passed away I’ve been raising him and his older brother, for 7 years and they have **never** been difficult. They are very smart and obedient boys they have always been academically at the top of their class. I make sure they participate in extra curricular activities like SAT prep piano classes and sports. 

Just recently my youngest nephew got his license and a few weeks ago he got to pick out a car, now I am planning on taking it away but I know that won’t bother him. At least he won’t have the ability to pick up his BF before school specially now that I know he’s doing *that* I am more mortified at the things they could have been doing inside the car. 

He has never really required any discipline and the few times I have taken his cell phone or his video games away it has no effect on him because he truly doesn’t care for those things. I don’t want to take his keyboard because he truly enjoys making music and I don’t want to take away something that has a positive effect on his life. I don’t want to take the gym away because again I think it’s something healthy and good for him. What I do want is to remove is that little hussy from his life. 

Now I’m slightly frustrated and I shouldn’t call him that but this young man is shameless. He constantly bombards my nephew with words like “I love you” and he eats it up. All night he was screaming that, all night. It’s irritating because my nephew is always showering him with gifts nothing too big just small trinkets and always buying him ice cream, coffee, boba or a meal. And this young man has nothing to offer but his body. Again I shouldn’t say that it’s not proper but I am a little bit upset with what happened. 

Anyways, my nephew got very upset with me after I told him that his BF was no longer allowed to visit, he was incredibly disrespectful, he has never been like this. Until he met that boy. As a man raised in the 80’s I dreamed of the belt for the first time but did not used it. And I don’t plan on using it but let me tell you if I ever did that with my father I would have welts in my back. 

Yesterday as I was preparing dinner that boy came to my house. They think they’re so slick and that I won’t catch them talking through the window on the cameras. I don’t know what to do. I’ve already asked him not to come yet here he is. I’m considering getting a guard dog. Am I over reacting? ",0,1762097409.0,AIO,8,0.33,False

I looked at her and told her I would take her for a walkies when she got better, she looked at me for the last time and somehow wagged her tail. In that moment of pure panic and heartbreak, I lost control. I tried to leave the room to stop myself making a scene,  but the room was tiny, and as I rushed for the door, I pushed past my wife. It wasn’t deliberate, I just needed to get out. That split second changed everything.

That one act of barging past my wife trying to flee the room lead to the vets reporting it to the police as domestic violence (without injury).

Outside, I was sobbing, screaming that I wished I was dead. I wasn’t violent or threatening anyone,  I was just in shock. Staff called the police out of concern. They later found me walking down the road, calmed me down and took me to my mum’s, saying it was a welfare issue. There was no arrest, no charges, just a broken man who’d lost his dog and lost control.

I should have stayed there quietly and grieved. Instead, over the next few days, everything fell apart. I was lost, guilt-ridden, barely sleeping. I walked for miles, talked to strangers, slept in a hedge one night, and was later reported missing. The police found me safe the next morning, sat me down for a coffee, and reunited me with my wife and kids briefly. She told me to stay with my mum for now and get help. She was calm and kind, said we’d talk, and we stayed in touch over WhatsApp.

Over the next couple of weeks, things were mixed. My wife was caring to a degree, she sent some positive things over whatsapp and filled me with hope that it would just be 2-3 weeks and then I could go home. But, this soon changed. We had a bit of mixed conversations sometimes she was ok, others cold. The idea was I would stay away for a few weeks, get some counselling and grieve / heal before going home.

Then everything just flipped. Around the third week of August, she suddenly blocked me on WhatsApp. One minute we were talking about progress, the next,  single grey tick, no profile photo. Then I noticed she’d blocked me on Facebook too. I panicked, called friends, tried to understand what I’d done wrong. I’d been messaging calmly, showing her I was doing therapy, making progress, even apologising for everything. Then,  silence.

3 weeks later (after agonising silence from being blocked with no answers), I got served with a non-molestation order. Out of nowhere. A one-year order banning me from all contact with my wife and children. I couldn’t message, call, or even share photos of the boys online. Reading her witness statement broke me,  it portrayed me as something I’m not. I’m not violent, not abusive, not dangerous. I was a man who fell apart in grief. At the same time she also applied for an occupation order.

At the time the statement was written (15th August), she was still messaging me kindly. That’s what destroyed me most,  the mixed signals. One version of her was compassionate and encouraging; the other, in the paperwork, made me out to be a threat.  The witness statement had some horrible stuff in it, much of which wasn't true - the thing is, it didnt look or read like something my wife would have written, it was honestly heartbreaking to read.

The thing is - she literally cut me off, blocked my family - all out of the blue.

Since then, I’ve been completely cut off. I’ve kept paying the mortgage, bills and £2k a month to support them, but I’ve been homeless,  living between my parents’ sofa and spare room. I haven’t seen my boys in three months. I’ve stayed sober since August, I’m in therapy four times a week, and I’m working to rebuild everything,  myself, my business, my mental health.

At the return hearing in October, I asked to reduce the order to six months and allow limited WhatsApp contact about the kids. My wife refused. The court kept it at 12 months. She cried during the hearing,  I could see she was in pain too,  but still said no.

I was briefly told by 1 friend who was in contact with her that child/social services got involved and that she didnt want this order but her arm was forced basically - she kept mentioning ""child services"" and ""other agencies"" - but the thing that makes no sense is that I've NEVER been contacted by any agencies?

(I've since filed a SAR with child services / council for a copy of any data held against me) and filed a seperate SAR with the council for any information held on my boys.

Now I live in limbo. No closure, no contact, no idea what she feels or thinks. I don’t even know if she still loves me, or if this is just the system keeping us apart. Everything about it feels wrong,  like one emotional breakdown has cost me my entire life.

Since she blocked me - even though I've done NOTHING wrong, she's gotten worse - she was speaking with a mutual friend who acted as a go-between indirectly but, she blocked him when she found out he'd been relaying to me.

She tells people one thing but does another? after the court hearing (Return hearing) she rang my friend upset saying she feels awful and that she hopes she can drop the order in 6 months? But then she goes and blocks him for relaying anything to me?

She blocked my business partner for no reason, unblocked him and then blocked him again after sending him a nice message apologising for blocking him saying ""it all got a bit much"".

She's living her life, she's out with the kids sharing photos on social media (I cannot see I am blocked but I have been told) - she's in the house, all bills paid, mortgage paid, everything paid and she gets £2k a month whilst I literally am falling to pieces over the mental torture.

It's destroying me - it's literally driving me to breaking point - because I have no answers, nothing.

One minute we are living together, kids, living life and then boom - blocked, barred and locked out with court orders - no idea if we are together anymore, no idea if there's a future and I've gotten to the point where 3 months of this has destroyed me - I don't think I can go another month before I break.

The thing is, I don't know if I cut her off financially and file for divorce whether that will be a wake up call or whether it will ultimately end the marriage - I have no idea what to do.

I was contemplating giving it 6 months and applying for an order variation in February to see if she would accept a reduction and then using that as the decision point for divorce.

I've heard a voice note from her to one of my friends saying she wanted me away for 12 months to sort my head out, and that she needs to be ABSOLUTELY certain that I am stable mentally and emotionally before I come home, that's why she rejected the 6 month variation request at the return hearing - but, in reality I cannot see this being viable.

Being honest - I had faults, I worked too many hours, was often tired and not as engaging as a father as I could be (I still did bedtimes, spent some time with them, went days out), I would drink a few beers on a wednesday, friday and saturday night but never got drunk, and I had an underlying anger issue with my work / PC at home, I would shout at the PC or get angry with it - there was never any violence or aggression towards my family but I used to get pissed with the computer/things crashing/losing clients and Id shout, bang the keyboard - but, again, I accepted this was an issue and have been in therapy/counselling for it - a lot of the issues were down to sleep deprivation.

My wife hasn't worked in the 12 years we've been together, we are a single income family. She took the 2 boys out of school last year and began homeschooling - so she now is classed as a full time home-educator.

I had a tough 2024 into 2025 with AI causing a lot of disruption to my business, all my businesses saw financial downturn whilst all my bills and costs went up, so I was stressed and exhausted - but I did my best for my little family.

I’m not a bad man. I made mistakes, absolutely. But I’ve owned them, fixed what caused them, and stayed accountable. I’ve done everything right since that day. Yet I’m stuck, alone, unsure if time will heal this or just quietly erase everything I loved.

IS THERE ANY WAY I CAN SAVE THIS MARRIAGE?

Do you think there is any hope or things I could potentially do?

  
She hasn't divorced me, she never told me it was over, on her witness statement she stated ""the relationship is not officially over""  - so I don't know.

Do I just get on with life and wait it out to see if things change?

Or am I holding on to false hope?",0,1762097270.0,relationship_advice,14,0.25,False

So here’s the deal, I (22F) somehow ended up liking one of my closest friends... who also happens to be gay.

We’ve been friends for almost a year now. He’s funny, kind, and honestly one of the few people I feel completely comfortable around. We hang out a lot, late-night coffee runs, movie nights, random deep talks about life and relationships. He’s open about being gay, and I’ve always respected that. I never thought I’d catch feelings because, like… I knew he wasn’t into girls. But lately, whenever we’re together, I get this weird fluttery feeling that’s hard to shake off.

It’s not like he flirts with me or anything though he’s naturally affectionate. He gives long hugs, compliments me a lot, and texts me good morning sometimes, which doesn’t help my confused little heart. I know he’s just being himself, but I can’t stop overthinking every small thing.

Now I’m stuck wondering, do I tell him how I feel just to get it off my chest? Or would that make things awkward and ruin our friendship? I don’t expect him to like me back, obviously, but it’s been eating at me. I feel dumb for even letting this happen, but feelings don’t exactly ask for permission, right?

I just don’t know how to deal with this. Do I distance myself for a bit? Try to move on silently? Or should I be honest even if it changes things? Has anyone else ever fallen for someone they knew they couldn’t have? I could really use some perspective here.",4,1762097230.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

by Jack Mercer

I wake up on a mattress — not a drunk-tank floor, which is progress.
The room smells like strangers and ozone, a faint electric tang in the air. There are framed family photos on the dresser and a bookshelf full of knickknacks and not a single book. Someone’s home or B&B. Not mine.
I’m naked. Freezing. My skull feels like it’s packed with wet sand. I pull a blanket over my head and gag on my own bourbon breath — synapses attempting to fire through fog and time.
Then it comes back in static bursts — the flight, the little bottles, the business meetings, pretending to be sober, pretending to be fine.
The flashes sharpen — a blur of the French Mediterranean, jumping off the yacht, drinking, white hulls, and champagne sun.
Our company’s “team-building” yacht day, meant to unify the executives, ended with me yelling at the CEO in front of the entire team. Hours later, I was deposited at the train station to Paris, where I’d catch my flight back to Boston.
I was still drunk and convinced I was fine — the most dangerous lie of all.
Then: oh, shit.
I sit up too fast. The world tilts. Suit crumpled on the floor. Shoes by the door. No briefcase. I almost black out.
I can hear voices outside — not English, not French.
Something northern. Cold, quick vowels.
When I step into the hallway, a woman built like a sumo wrestler freezes mid-conversation. She’s standing next to a surprised man in a beret. Both look at me like they just found a rabid raccoon in the kitchen.
“Sorry,” I mumble, “but… could you tell me where I am?”
They trade looks. The woman speaks fast, syllables cracking like glass, and I can’t understand — only adding to her frustration, apparently with me.
I finally catch one word:
RAY-ka-vick.
“Raayka…”
“Iceland,” the man in the beret stammers. “You are in Iceland!”
“Iceland?” I repeat, like saying it might undo it. “Iceland?? I’m in fucking Iceland?!”
They don’t laugh.
Suddenly, an older man appears from the back room — thin, gray, and out of breath.
“Sir,” he says. “You don’t remember?”
“Remember what?”
He tells me I was kicked off the plane. Tried to hurt myself. The airport police brought me here to sober up.
It sounds like there were restraints. Maybe cuffs.
Feeling had just returned to my left hand from the last time the cuffs were cinched too tight and left on for the ride in the sheriff’s van. They called it diesel therapy — three and a half hours of hard turns, sudden stops, and the smell of burnt fuel and fear. On my way to the slammer, I was sandwiched between men twice my size and ten times my violent tendencies, bouncing off them like a pinball every time the driver hit the brake.
If this happened in Boston, I’d be waking up in a cell.
“Oh God,” I whisper. The thought of another cell…
It starts to seep back in — flickers, fogged-over snapshots.
My brain does me the favor of keeping the worst parts fuzzy.
The old man tells me it’s almost eleven in the morning. My return flight is tonight.
I nod like I’m fine, though I can feel the withdrawal crawling up my spine.
I’ve been drinking around the clock for months.
“Is there somewhere to… eat?” I ask.
“There’s a café by the coast,” he says. “But it’s cold and stormy, and we have no more umbrellas.”
“Do they serve alcohol?”
That earns me the look. Not because they hate Americans — because they know what I am.
Outside, the rain slants sideways, pelting my face like needles.
The wind hits like punishment. My body shakes, but not from the cold — from the despair, the loneliness, the withdrawals.
I spot a convenience store — neon against the gray.
The sign stops me cold:
10:11, On the Go.
That number again — the one that’s been following me for years.
Receipts. Clocks. Plane tickets. Jail. Bridgewater.
Now it’s the name of a store.
Message or madness, I don’t know.
But it points toward the bar.
Inside the restaurant, it’s warm. Impossibly normal.
A roaring fireplace.
The smell of eggs and bacon.
Families in sweaters. Kids coloring on placemats. Couples drinking coffee after church.
And then there’s me — the man at the bar ordering dark beer and whiskey chasers at eleven in the morning.
The bartender hesitates before pouring, like he’s serving poison to a ghost.
I become aware that people are looking at me — a Sunday-morning ghost rolling in off the foggy banks of their shore.
The beer hits my stomach like mercy.
The whiskey follows. My hands stop shaking. My lungs remember how to breathe.
I tune everyone and everything out.
For a moment, the world stops spinning.
Then I remember the judge.
The court date.
I’m on trial for assault and battery.
The judge let me leave the country because, apparently, people who run biotech and telemedicine companies don’t fit the usual criminal profile — and I wasn’t considered a flight risk.
My flight’s in a few hours. I look at my ticket and think about the very real possibility of going to jail for a long time. Maybe five years.
Maybe I should just stay here, in Iceland. Escape.
I can’t. I have three beautiful children I’ve been trying to come home to for years.
I tell myself: just one more drink.
Somewhere around the tenth, the room starts to tilt.
The laughter, the fire, the sound of clinking dishes — all of it fades into a low hum.
The last thing I see is the whiskey glass sliding away from my hand as the floor rushes up to meet me
Blackout.

1omjz1g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gifts/comments/1omjz1g/need_help_with_searching_for_christmas_presents/,need help with searching for christmas presents for very picky parents,"hi I usually don’t have as much trouble searching for presents but the two most impossible people are my parents. 

My father likes sci-fi stuff — especially Star Wars and Star Trek. I think he once mentioned The Thing was one of his favourite movies as well? He also likes anything that has to do with Tolkien. That would seem like an easy enough present guide but problem is; he already has all Tolkien books (and he is not the type of person to appreciate special editions) and he just doesn’t read the Star Wars and Star Trek books. I guess I could get something themed on this but I have no clue what? Mug or any clothes would most likely not be that appreciated so I just don’t really know what else…. 
He also likes to cook? 

And my mom… well that’s worse. No matter what, she just never likes whatever she gets. Last year my younger sister and I pitched each some money and bought her this very expensive necklace from a brand I knew she liked. The gemstone was even in her favourite colour (forest green) and it took me long time to even pick it. And again that thing was genuinely expensive. When she opened the gift, she just looked at it, then closed it again and moved on. I never even saw her wear it or anything. 

My older sibling once gave her this really nice edition of some Agatha Christie collection and again she just kinda scoffed and left it be. 

She is materialistic person and definitely values the “expensive” / good looking stuff over things picked with heart I guess? 
(And I mean that with all destain. My father gave her some really nice ring that he thought she’d like for her birthday. She then proceeded to call my older sibling and complain to them how much she hated that ring and that she wanted to return it….I get it might have not been her style or something but it still feels kind of cruel.) 

I don’t really know what to give her as no matter what I pick, I doubt it will be good enough for her. 

She likes jewellery (but I guess everyone just picks the wrong one), more “trendy” clothes I guess? (she buys clothes way too often?) 
I though of buying a new coffee machine for her as the one at home is stubborn and sometimes stop working, but I am studying in a different country and I have no clue how I’d order that? Plus no idea if she would actually appreciate it tbh. 

She also likes history stuff (especially medieval Czechia, but she already has all the books I could think of?). And crime thrillers and true crime books — problem is if it’s not the book she specifically asks for, she won’t like it. (My grandmother (from father’s side) once gave her a history book for Christmas. It was a different one than the one she asked for as she couldn’t find that one anywhere. My mom just complained to me about how she “shouldn’t have bought anything then” after.) 

At this point I realise it would be best to just give up, but I want to try one more time. She is not always this rude and kinda cruel. When she gives us gifts it’s always stuff you ask for and she goes to good lengths to actually get it for you. So I just want to try to find something for the last time before I give up. 

Any suggestions are highly appreciated! 

(ALSO: we are not native english speakers. My mom can’t speak English at all and my father can do so only barely — both speak only Czech.  Due to that please dont recommend books that are only in english. Thanks:) ) ",1,1762096784.0,Gifts,4,1.0,False
1omjyzn,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1omjyzn/on_a_hot_afternoon_with_my_wife_eve/,On a hot afternoon with my wife Eve,"The AC died twenty minutes back. The air inside the Swift turned heavy, thick with dust and the coconut scent of Eve’s skin.

Eve rolls the window down an inch. Hot wind slips in and lifts the hem of her cotton sundress. The fabric sticks to the small of her back and the curve of her thighs. She shifts with bare feet on the warm seat. “I’m wet everywhere” she says, voice low, almost shy.

My eyes flick from the road. My shirt clings to my chest in damp patches, top two buttons undone. I reach over and my palm settles on Eve’s knee. Not grabbing. Just there. Warm. Familiar.

Eve covers my hand with hers, traces the vein on the back of it, then guides me higher. Under the dress. Past the soft skin of her inner thigh. Until my fingers brush the damp cotton between her legs. Eve exhales slow.

“Next left” she murmurs.

I turn onto a narrow dirt track. A stray dog lifts its head, sniffs, trots off. I cut the engine behind a cluster of neem trees. The sudden quiet is loud. Only cicadas, the soft tick of cooling metal, our breathing.

Eve unbuckles. The click sounds sharp. She climbs over the console, knees sinking into the warm leather on either side of my hips. The steering wheel presses against her spine but she doesn’t care.

Eve kisses me slow. Lips soft then open. Her tongue meets mine, lazy, tasting coffee and the faint sweetness of the misri I popped earlier. Her hands slide under my shirt, palms gliding over the damp curve of my waist, the smooth plane of my stomach. No bra. Just skin, warm and slick with sweat.
Eve reaches between us. Pops the button of my jeans. Eases the zipper down. I’m hard, hot against her fingers. She strokes once, thumb brushing the slick bead at the tip. I exhale against her mouth.

“Eve.”

She tugs her panties aside and sinks down. Slow. The stretch makes her eyelids flutter. She pauses halfway, lets her body adjust, then takes the rest. Full. Perfect.
We stay still for a moment. Just breathing. I feel Eve’s pulse around me.

Then she starts to move. Small circles at first. The car creaks softly. Outside a cyclist coasts by, glances in, eyes widening before he pedals faster. Eve feels the flicker of being seen and presses closer to me, hiding in my neck.

My hands settle on Eve’s hips, guiding but not rushing. She rocks steadily, clit rubbing against me with every roll. Sweat gathers between her breasts, slides down. I bend my head, lick it away, then close my lips over her nipple through the thin cotton. The wet heat makes her gasp.

Eve’s close. So am I. My hips lift to meet hers, shallow, perfect.

“Come with me” she whispers.
I groan, buried deep, and let go. The first pulse sends Eve over. She clenches around me, muffling her moan against my shoulder, tasting salt and sunblock.

We stay locked, breathing hard. Eve’s fingers trace the damp hair at my nape.
After a minute she kisses the corner of my mouth. “Hotel’s ten minutes. I want the AC on full and your mouth on me.”

I laugh softly, start the car. The windows stay cracked, letting the scent of us drift out behind.",0,1762096781.0,confessions,5,0.33,False

It’s just to help you get to know me before you message.

I’m Max and as the title states, I’m looking for a ride or die. Maybe that’s just through being friends, maybe that’s through something deeper? I’m open to that and everything between.
I’m posting as my social circle has shrunk quite a lot recently. I’ve recently returned from a gap year working as a volunteer teacher in China and I’ve lost contact with a lot of folk so I’m trying to build my connections up again.

I’m a pretty perfect split between being an introvert and an extrovert. I love getting cosy, curling up with a good cup of coffee, some movies or a book or even just staring out my window, headphones on, and watch the world go by. On the other hand, I yearn for the outdoors. If I’m not roaming the hills and forests with my camera, I’m almost certainly running or cycling miles along the roads, and I’ve got some beautiful scenery to do it in. I run both for leisure and competitively and I’m just beginning a training block for an upcoming challenge next year.
I’m also into creative writing and poetry if there’s anyone else who’s interested in that!

If looks matter to you, I’m 6’0, pretty lanky but still fit, dark brown hair that’s in some kind of a messy fringe and blue eyes (that are apparently miley cyrus blue, whatever that means?)

I don’t ask for a lot in people, but honesty goes a long way. Otherwise just be yourself, however bubbly or serious that may be. If you think we’ll click, don’t sit on the other side of the screen and wonder what could be - find out and tell me a bit about yourself!

I’m happy to chat through Reddit or move to another platform if and when you’re comfortable and I’ve got no issue with sharing pictures. I’m also a pretty open book so if there’s anything that’s caught your eye here that you want to ask about, please do!

Hope everyone who reads this has a great day and I look forward to meeting people soon! :)",1,1762096698.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

Section One: 
Assets and Debt: We owe ~$20k on my husband’s 2025 Equinox (we bought this when they had a 0% APR deal. As Muslim’s, we try to avoid dealing with interest. It is very difficult to do this in the United States but we try our best. For example, I bought my car in cash. We owe ~$290k on our small 3bdrm2bth house that we bought in 2023. We used an Islamic lender for this. Thankfully after I graduated from nursing school, I worked a lot of overtime and saved so we paid off my husband’s $70k in student loans and my old car.

Retirement Balance: $45k in 401k and Roth. My husband’s company recently started to allow employees to self select funds/stocks to invest in so we are now able to choose to invest in things that align with our values. For example, Muslims don’t drink alcohol and try to avoid investing in companies that profit from alcohol sales. Because we try to avoid dealing with interest, we are also limited in what types of companies or bonds we can invest in. Of course not everyone takes it this seriously and I know many Muslims who deal with interest in some way, but this is what we are comfortable with. Islamic finances can be a little confusing to explain. 

Equity if you're a homeowner: Only $20-30k. We put down $16k on a $325k house in 2023. We only had 3 months between when we decided to buy and when we closed so we didn’t save a huge down payment. We went with a Islamic financing company called UIF. 
Savings account balance: $45,500
Checking account balance: $4,500
Credit card debt: $0, we try to avoid debt and interest. We use cards for points and pay them off every week. 
Student loan debt: $0 (my husband graduated with $70k for his engineering degree and we paid it off this year after months of working overtime. This was a big goal of ours before having kids.)

Section Two: Income
Income Progression: Nursing is my second degree. I've been working as a labor and delivery nurse for 2.5 years, my starting pay was $33.00/hr with a $6.50/hr night shift differential. I got 2 raises and my base pay was $38/hr by my 1.5 year mark. Then I went from being full-time staff to PRN and gave up benefits to make $47/hr base with $6.50/nights and picked up lots of overtime. In July 2025 I started a temporary contract making $70/hr on dayshift. It’s great money but there’s no benefits or guarantee for how long it will last. Thankfully it’s easy to find a job as a nurse. I do anticipate taking a paycut one day and only working part time or PRN once we have kids. If I get pregnant soon I’m honestly not sure if I would want to keep doing contracts. 
My husband is a mechanical engineer and makes $114k base with a 10% yearly bonus and regular overtime as well. 

Main Job Monthly Take Home:
Me: $8000/month on contract currently. No benefits or retirement. 
My husband: $6500. He pays $180/month for both our health insurance and about $900/month for retirement. He gets the company match as well. 

Section Three: Expenses
Mortgage: $2580, but we pay an extra $200/month. Husband pays this. 
Savings contribution: I typically save $4,000-6,000/month of my income every month. I know this is not sustainable but I had big financial goals I wanted to meet before getting off the pill and trying to conceive. In 2024 I decided I wanted to pay off student loans, travel overseas several times, buy a bigger car in cash, help my husband buy a new car, go back to school, and beef up our emergency fund. I grew up without money so in order to feel more comfortable, I want to have a good amount of cushion to fall back on especially before I take a pay cut or get pregnant and work less hours. 
Investment contribution: Noted above. 
Debt payments: $850 for my husband’s car. He pays for this. It was a 36 months at 0% APR loan. We owe about $20k and I will probably help him pay it off before we have kids. 
Donations: We donate $200ish a month. Charity is a big part of our faith. We also pay yearly “zakat” which is the required charity. It is a once a year payment of 2.5% of your savings. If you don’t have savings, you aren’t required to pay this. I usually give mine to my extended family overseas who are struggling or to a non-profit I love. 
Electric: $130
Water: $130
Wifi: $90
Cellphone: We are still on our parent’s plans and we will ride that out as long as they let us. It wouldn’t save them much to take us off since they each carry 5 to 6 lines with our younger siblings. We buy our iPhones outright so they don’t have to pay for our phones. 
Subscriptions: $100 for SimpliSafe, Netflix, Apple storage, etc
Gym membership: $50 
Car insurance: $110 for mine (we bundled with our home insurance). My husband's parents pay for his as a gift but we will be taking over in November. 
Regular therapy: $200/month
Tuition: I am getting my Bachelors of Science in Nursing and I pay about $1500 in tuition every 6 weeks. Most nurses job will pay for this but I have sacrificed benefits for better pay. The total cost is $9000 and I should finish the 10 classes in March 2026.

*My work week is Monday-Sunday at this hospital but I did my diary from Sunday-Saturday so there’s 4 shifts included but I only work 3 shifts a week. I wrote in detail about my workdays so skip that if you aren’t interested!

Sunday:
4:30am: I wake up before my work alarm and struggle to fall back to sleep unfortunately. I take the toll road out of habit ($1.50). I get to work by 6:40am to clock in and get report on my 2 patients. I also sneak off to pray the morning prayer. Muslims pray five times a day at specific time intervals and I usually end up doing 2-4 of those prayers at work. 

7am: I have a postpartum Csection patient and a patient who’s in the early stages of an induction. I assess both of them, check bleeding, draw some labs, and give pain medication. 

8am: I transfer my postpartum c/s to her postpartum room. I reposition my laboring pt with the peanut ball. She’s 4cm and doesn’t want an epidural. We eventually start pitocin  to help her contractions get stronger and closer together. Thankfully her boyfriend and family are helping her cope with the contractions. I monitor her baby closely and chart her strip every 15 minutes. 

12pm: I got hungry early so I have some leftover baked pasta with ground beef. We take a 30 minute “uninterrupted” lunch that we have to clock out for but in reality we still watch our patients baby from the breakroom. In labor and delivery pretty much anything can happen at any moment so we are constantly looking at our baby and don’t even step away to use the bathroom without asking someone else to keep an eye on them. 

4pm: My patient is literally sobbing from pain but doesn’t want an epidural. We practice breathing techniques and use a labor comb for distraction but she isn’t getting much relief. We’ve also tried IV pain medicine as well. I end up staying at her side for hours to console her and adjust her monitor. 

5:45pm: My patient decides she wants an epidural. It takes 45 minutes to place it due to her positioning and the anesthesiologist struggling.  I turned her Pitocin off to help her have a break from contractions but she is still crying and in pain. By this point in the shift, I feel physically sore.

7pm: My patient is finally comfortable. She takes a nap and I give report and drive home. I briefly consider picking up a sweet treat as a reward for my long day, but I refrain. I do take the toll to save five minutes. ($1.50)

8pm: My husband went to the grocery store and spent $101. He also went to the halal meat store and spent $26. Shower, eat a quick dinner my husband made, and fall asleep by 10pm. 

Daily total: $130

Monday:
6:45am: My husband is already at work when I wake up for morning prayer. It takes maybe 5 minutes to pray but I struggle to fall back asleep which is unfortunately normal for me. I toss and turn and end up scrolling on my phone for hours. I love a good bed rot but I hate not sleeping in, especially because I work tomorrow. 

11am: I pickup a Chipotle burrito and accidentally order chips too ($16). Fun fact, my first job was at Chipotle in high school where I made $8.50/hr as a cashier and I remember a burrito (no guac) was $7.04 with tax lol.

2pm: I work on BSN homework for a few hours while watching Wayward on Netflix. I also take my last progesterone pill and hope my period comes soon. I have PCOS and have not had a period since I got off birth control in April. I just started progesterone to help my period and will also use letrozole this cycle to hopefully ovulate and get pregnant. I planned this year out thinking I would be pregnant by now but we plan and God plans too.

5pm: My husband is home and he asks if we should go out for dinner. Eating out is honestly the main thing we do for fun so I of course say yes. We order chicken tikka, lamb korma, garlic naan, and mango lassi from a local Indian restaurant ($39). He also came home with just because flowers and a Ulta gift card for me ($59). 

7pm: After dinner, we watch Scandal and get ready for bed. I’m pretty exhausted and fall asleep before 10pm. 

Daily total: $114


Tuesday:
5:45am: We’re both up for work and I’m desperately wishing I could sleep in. 

6:45am: I clock in and get report on my patient. She just delivered and is still getting her tear repaired. I help clean her up and start her recovery, where I check her bleeding and vitals q15min.

8:30am: I get my 2nd patient who is 6cm transferred over from triage. We get her consents and admission done and get her an epidural. In between, I check on my postpartum patients bleeding and pain. I’m running around for a few hours then finally get to sit down and chart.

12pm: I have leftovers for lunch, check in on my patient, and finish charting. My family friend got admitted to the hospital so I walk over to the other tower to visit with her. 

4pm: My patient is now on pitocin. I monitor her baby, increase her dose, and do different positions to keep her hips open and encourage baby to come down in her pelvis. 

5:30pm: I decide to check my patient because we have really bonded and I want to deliver her before I clock out. Unfortunately the newer resident doctor who checked her before me overshot her check and she has not made much progress. We’re both a little disappointed, but she was a difficult cervical check so I can’t blame the resident. I keep doing position changes and increasing her pitocin. 

7:45pm: Home. Thankfully my husband cooked dinner again. I shower, eat, watch Scandal and head to bed at 9:30. 

Daily total: $0

Wednesday:
5:39am: My alarms start going off. Even though I went to bed at a good time last night, I feel very sleepy and wish I could stay in bed. I quickly get dressed, pack my lunch, and head to work. 

7am: I get report on my two patients. One is postpartum and delivered a few hours ago. The other is 5cm. My 5cm is also Muslim and doesn’t speak English but I can tell she is relieved to hear me as her nurse. I assess both, give pain meds, chart, and transfer my postpartum to her new room. 

9am: My 5cm gets an epidural. After I get her settled, I hear that I might get a 2nd labor patient because we don’t have any free nurses. Around 11am, I end up with a 6cm patient who is trying to go natural. I finish her admission and consents, and hang medication while checking on my other patient periodically. Thankfully some other nurses jump in and help me without me even having to ask.

12:30: My coworker and I convince ourselves we deserve a treat and order Coco Shrimp for lunch. I quickly scarf it down because I have a feeling my natural patient will deliver soon. ($18)

1pm: My original patient is 8cm and my second patient is hurting a ton and wants an epidural now. I’m running back and forth between my rooms. It takes several tries to get her epidural. In the meantime my first patients baby starts to have big dips in the heart rate. I step out to her room and check her cervix, shes 10cm which explains the heart rate issues. I reposition her, notify the doctors, then run back to my other patients epidural. Eventually she gives up and says she just wants to push. We lay her back, I check her cervix and shes 10cm. I call the doctors and we have a baby. My charge nurse and friends start pushing with my first patient in the meantime, because the doctors don’t want to wait since her baby looks suspicious on the monitor. 

3pm: I step into my original patients room and we have a baby as well. She prefers female caregivers only because of our religion so the male attending stands behind the curtain while the female residents deliver her baby and repair her tear. Her repair takes a while so I use that time to catch up on charting. It’s been such a busy day and I have barely sat down, but I am so glad both my patients had smooth deliveries. Our unit as a whole delivered over 10 babies on this shift. 

6pm: I finish both my patients 2 hour recoveries where I check their bleeding and vitals and give pain meds. I transfer them both to postpartum. I also visit my patient from yesterday that I didn’t get to deliver. She tells me everything that happened in her delivery and then shows me her baby pictures. I confirm that her baby came out looking just like her as a baby. My body is so sore and achey from all the standing today (am I getting too old for this? Lol) but I’m grateful to be apart of these special moments with people. 

7:30pm: Home! My husband ordered drain cleaning supplies and coffee filters for $21. I shower and eat leftovers for dinner. My sister comes over to spend the night. She’s in nursing school and I live a lot closer to her campus than my parents so she stays with me occasionally. We watch the love is blind reunion on Netflix while eating popcorn. I’m in bed by 11pm. 

Daily total: $39

Thursday:
6:30am: I’m awake for the morning prayer. I also got paid last night ($4027). It’s a little short because the unit was overstaffed and I was sent home early last week. The hard thing about doing a contract is your hours 
aren’t always guaranteed if they don’t need you. If they continue to be overstaffed, it’s very possible that they will cancel my contract so I’m mentally trying to prepare for that. I transfer $1500 to savings and pay $1500 (included in bills) towards my tuition bill that is due tomorrow. This brings our savings balance to $45.5k. During this contract I have typically transferred $3k to savings unless I had to pay tuition. I eventually fall back asleep.

3:30pm: Today has been very chill. I’m spending my time cleaning, doing laundry, and watching Selling Sunset on Netflix. I also do a home cardio and weights workout. I get an email from my manager stating that they are going to end contracts on November 23rd. I honestly had a feeling that this was coming so it’s better to know than to feel like things are up in the air. This gives me two more paychecks to save from. I’m considering just taking a break from working full time after this, and I am grateful to be in a position where I could even consider that. I know my coworkers who are single mothers are in a very different position. I’m not sure what I want to do next or if I would even want to work full time, especially if I end up getting pregnant soon. 

6pm: My sister comes back to my house after school. My husband also comes home and orders some sweatpants and tshirts from Old Navy for our universal trip next week ($49). He also bought a Celsius and gum at work for $6. We have indomei ramen and fried eggs for dinner. We talk about what life and our finances will look like if I take a break from working for a while. I jokingly ask him if he still loves me even if I will be unemployed soon. I apply to a local PRN job that requires 6 shifts in 6 weeks. It’s night shift unfortunately but something to consider. 

8pm: We watch some TikToks and Scandal and head to bed around 10pm. 

Daily total: $55

Friday: 
5:45am: Wake up, get dressed, head to work. 

7am: I get report on my patient. She is an induction for a trial of labor after a csection. I asses her, chart, and wait for the doctors to decide what method of induction they want to start with. The doctors then realize that her last Csection was done with an incision that went vertical so it is not safe to labor due to increased risk of uterine rupture. She agrees to a repeat csection. She heads to the operating room and I admit the next scheduled Csection. I draw her labs, get her consent’s signed, and shave her so she is ready for the OR. 

12pm: I get another patient from triage who is dilated to 7cm. We admit her, do consents, and get her an epidural. 

1pm: I go to lunch and watch my patient’s baby from the break room. Afterwards we break my patients water and see that her baby has taken their first poop (meconium) inside. This sometimes just happens, and other times it happens because the baby is under stress. I do different positions with her and the peanut ball but her baby has some dips in the heart rate.

5pm: We recheck my patients cervix and shes still the same dilation. I keep trying different positions but her baby continues to have heart rate decelerations. I end up going back-and-forth with a resident doctor about my patient strip. I’m not a confrontational person, but I always feel the need to advocate for my patient. I always think if this was my baby what would I want my nurse to do? Would I want them to just overlook the signs of stress my baby is giving them? Ultimately the attending agreed with me and we put internal monitors into her uterus and onto her baby's head to see what her babies doing more clearly.

6:45pm: I give report to the night shift nurse and say goodbye to my patient and wish her good luck. I head home. My husband texted me that he is thinking of ordering dinner because we are out of leftovers. He orders halal wings and gyros for $23. 

8pm: My mother in law sends us money ($250) for our Universal trip next week which is so thoughtful and kind. We discuss what we should spend it on. We also discuss my conflicted feelings about my contract ending. All day today my coworkers were finding out I was leaving and telling me they were going to miss me. I am honestly going to miss them too. One coworker even told me to invite her to my future baby shower which is so sweet. My husband says he will pick up extra shifts at work to help us not feel stressed if I end up taking a break from working. My husband and I binge more Scandal and head to bed around 11pm. 

Daily total: $23

Saturday:
6:45am: We wake up for morning prayer. We lay around in bed and my husband falls back asleep for a little. My friend at work texts me to let me know my patient from last night had a smooth vaginal delivery. I always want closure when I leave my patients undelivered so I appreciate this update. I head to my breakfast plans with my old coworkers and order food to go for my husband as well ($37). My period starts while I’m at the restaurant!! I’m relieved that the medication is working. This means I will start my letrozole in 3 days and hopefully ovulate. 

1:30pm: We book our airport parking for our Universal trip next week ($66). 

7pm: My husband heads to the gym and gets gas ($35) and I head to dinner with my friends. I regret making multiple plans for the same day because I am pretty tired. While driving to the restaurant I call my mom and we catch up for 30 minutes. I spend $24 on Korean fried chicken and Kimchi fries. Me and my friends show each other our carts for the Sephora sale and give each other some recommendations. I’m thinking of picking up the Haus labs foundation, Kayali Maldives perfume, Huda Beauty easy bake powder, Danessa Myricks skin blurring balm, along with some refills. They recommend I add on the Hourglass concealer too. We also discuss our vision boards for 2025, what we hoped to accomplish, and what we didn’t quite get to. We plan our Friendsgiving dinner as well. 

10pm: Home! Me and my husband discuss the details of our trip and watch some Harry Potter to get into the mood. We head to bed.

REFLECTION:
This was a pretty typical week for us. I definitely want to cut down on our food spending. I think if I cook one or two more meals a week we will be in a better position. Once my contract officially ends I want to be more budget conscious so we don’t have to dip into our emergency fund. I have 2 calls with recruiters lined up for next week to discuss possible PRN labor and delivery jobs as well so I’m feeling hopeful overall. ",14,1762096592.0,MoneyDiariesACTIVE,7,0.89,False

I cleaned a bit, did some laundry, walked my dog and played some games. 
I am on my period so I feel a bit meh. 

However I was having a good time when I hear SS come in. 2 hours before I expected them. He came in loudly. Making his trademark random mouth noises, throwing his boots in the hallway. I quickly closed my game ( I play horror games and SS is quickly scared). 

He really likes me so gets started to tell me all about their day in a fast pace only a fellow ADHD-er can follow while he threw the rest of his stuff on the floor and his jacket in a random corner. 

SO followed starting to demand SS to clean up his stuff… he made a loud yes sir. Yes sir yes sir endlessly repeating it … while half cleaning up half finding the dog whistle I bought and using it. I asked him to stop and took it away. My dog started barking SO kept telling SS to clean up while SS loudly rambles about stuff and finds ways to postpone the job. SO getting angry but just keeps repeating his requests.
SO turns ons the coffee machine that loudly heats up and asks if I want to have a coffee. 
SS runs up stairs sounding like a band of horses making his endless mouth noises and howling like a deranged wolf… so my dog barks even more frantically… SO starts talking to me about perfume and pushes a bag in my face to smell…
He also tells me my car ( he borrowed ) is out of juice …

And my brain just went… NOPE.
I took my car keys. He asked me where I was going and I just told him: anywhere but here.

Luckily I have a hobby where I can always go and I can spend as little and as much time as I want. SO tried to follow me out, to ask to talk about it and I was like : nope leave me alone! 

I am diagnosed ADHD but I fear there might me some autism at play too. I can get extremely overwhelmed with SS his hyper activity and never ending noise. I have to brace myself to handle it. I don’t do well when plans change.

What once leaned toward traditional, ornate design has now found harmony with minimalism and European sophistication. Today’s British homes reflect a balance of warmth, craftsmanship, and contemporary style — blending heritage with modern living. From luxurious living rooms to chic outdoor areas, the right furniture and design choices can redefine how your home feels. In this article, we’ll explore how to achieve that refined yet comfortable atmosphere, featuring some of Europe’s most respected brands.

# Modern British Living: A Blend of Comfort and Design

British interior design has always been about creating inviting, character-filled spaces. Whether it’s a period townhouse in London, a countryside retreat in Yorkshire, or a sleek apartment in Manchester, every home tells a story. However, today’s UK homeowners are embracing a fresher approach — one that values open layouts, natural light, and a curated mix of materials.

This balance between comfort and sophistication is what makes modern British homes so unique. The influence of European craftsmanship has helped elevate these interiors further, bringing in timeless furniture pieces that are both functional and elegant.

# Outdoor Elegance for Every Season

The British love for the outdoors has only grown stronger, especially as gardens, terraces, and balconies become extensions of the home. The key to designing these spaces is choosing furniture that’s both stylish and durable — something that looks beautiful and performs well in the UK’s unpredictable weather.

That’s exactly what [**4 Seasons Outdoor**](https://themodernfurniturecompany.com/collections/4-seasons-outdoor) offers. Known for combining innovative design with weather-resistant materials, this brand brings luxurious comfort to outdoor living. Their collections include everything from lounge sets to dining tables, all crafted to withstand the elements while maintaining a modern, inviting aesthetic. With 4 Seasons Outdoor furniture, you can create a garden or patio that feels as refined as your indoor space, perfect for relaxing or entertaining year-round.

# Dining in Style: Italian Craftsmanship Meets British Taste

Dining rooms have always been a central gathering spot in UK homes. They are no longer formal spaces used only for special occasions — instead, they’ve become open, versatile areas that connect seamlessly to kitchens and living rooms. To make your dining space stand out, it’s worth investing in furniture that blends functionality with artistic design.

[**Bontempi Casa**](https://themodernfurniturecompany.com/collections/bontempi-casa) captures this vision perfectly. As one of Italy’s most renowned furniture makers, Bontempi Casa creates pieces that combine sleek modern lines with exceptional craftsmanship. Their dining tables, chairs, and storage units are designed with both aesthetics and practicality in mind. A Bontempi Casa table instantly adds a touch of elegance, whether you prefer a marble top, extendable design, or sculptural base. For UK homeowners looking to bring continental charm into their interiors, this brand offers the ideal balance of form and function.

# Living Room Sophistication: Art Meets Comfort

Your living room is where life unfolds — from cosy evenings to lively gatherings. It’s also a reflection of your personal taste, and finding the right furniture can completely transform the mood of the space.

[**Cattelan Italia**](https://themodernfurniturecompany.com/collections/cattelan-italia) is a brand that understands this balance between beauty and comfort. Their designs are bold, artistic, and effortlessly modern. Whether it’s a striking coffee table with geometric metalwork, a statement dining chair, or a sleek media unit, each piece from Cattelan Italia tells a story of innovation and refinement. Adding even one of their designs can elevate your living room from ordinary to extraordinary. For British homes that value both comfort and creative flair, Cattelan Italia offers furniture that is visually captivating yet undeniably functional.

# Craftsmanship and Warmth with Timeless Wood

No home feels complete without a touch of natural warmth, and wood has long been the heart of British interiors. The texture, tone, and timelessness of wooden furniture add soul to modern spaces, making rooms feel grounded and inviting.

[**Porada**](https://themodernfurniturecompany.com/collections/porada) embodies this philosophy through its masterful craftsmanship and use of premium materials. Every piece, from curved wooden chairs to sculpted consoles, celebrates the natural beauty of wood. The attention to detail and artistic shaping make Porada’s designs ideal for homeowners who appreciate subtle elegance. For UK interiors that combine modernity with warmth, Porada brings nature and sophistication together beautifully.

# Creating a Harmonious Colour Palette

Colour plays a vital role in home décor, especially in the UK where lighting can change dramatically throughout the day. Neutral tones like soft greys, creams, and warm whites create a calm base that complements British architecture. You can then add depth with muted blues, forest greens, or earthy browns — hues that feel timeless and soothing.

European furniture brands like Bontempi Casa and Porada offer finishes that blend seamlessly with these tones. By choosing furniture that works harmoniously with your colour palette, you can create a cohesive look that feels both comfortable and elevated.

# Textures and Layers for a Cosy Finish

Texture is the secret ingredient in every beautifully designed British home. From plush wool rugs to linen curtains and oak tables, layering different materials adds visual interest and tactile warmth. For a luxurious yet relaxed feel, mix materials — pair a leather sofa with a soft throw, or complement a glass table with woven chairs.

Furniture from Cattelan Italia or Porada often includes elegant materials such as glass, wood, and leather, giving you the freedom to layer and mix for depth and richness. This layering approach makes even minimalist spaces feel welcoming and lived-in — a hallmark of modern UK design.

# Maximising Space in Urban Homes

In UK cities, space can often be limited, making smart design choices essential. The key is to invest in furniture that serves multiple purposes and keeps the layout open. Opt for extendable dining tables, modular sofas, and wall-mounted shelving to free up floor space.

Light colours, mirrors, and transparent materials can also make smaller spaces feel larger and brighter. European furniture brands, particularly those like Bontempi Casa, are known for sleek, space-efficient designs that work beautifully in compact UK homes without sacrificing style.

# Lighting: Setting the Right Mood

Lighting can make or break your home’s atmosphere, especially in a country known for cloudy days. Layered lighting — combining ceiling fixtures, wall lamps, and table lights — ensures both function and ambiance. In your living room, use warm-toned lighting to create a cosy glow, while in kitchens and dining areas, opt for adjustable lighting that can shift from bright to intimate.

Statement lighting pieces from Cattelan Italia are perfect for adding artistic flair while illuminating your space. The right light fixture can double as a design feature, turning a functional item into a centrepiece of modern British décor.

# Sustainability and Long-Lasting Design

Sustainability has become a central consideration in British home design. Homeowners now look for furniture that is ethically produced, environmentally friendly, and built to stand the test of time. Investing in high-quality, durable furniture from European brands means fewer replacements, less waste, and more timeless beauty in your home.

Brands like 4 Seasons Outdoor and Porada are excellent examples of sustainable luxury — using durable, responsibly sourced materials and traditional techniques that reduce environmental impact. This combination of beauty and responsibility is the future of home décor in the UK.

# Final Thoughts: Crafting a Home that Reflects You

Designing a home in the UK today is about more than aesthetics — it’s about creating spaces that reflect personality, comfort, and modern sensibility. By choosing timeless, well-crafted furniture, you can ensure your home not only looks elegant but also feels truly yours.",1,1762096210.0,u_Business_Refuse_9579,0,1.0,False

Diagnoses: hashimoto's, perimenopause

My Dr has had me on NP Thyroid for a couple of years now, plus a thyroid supplement. I can tell an improvement when I take them vs miss them, primarily in that my fingers are less swollen through the day. But still struggle with chronic pain, mood swings, and brain fog.

For no reason in particular I recently started googling. I realized I'm not taking the thyroid Rx correctly in that I wasn't waiting a full 30 min before I ate and then would consume dairy like a crazy person (Cereal & milk, coffee with milk & cream, yogurt, cheese, etc). I began setting a 5am alarm and setting the pill on my nightstand. At 5:30, I got up and took other supplements and did Pilates, then at 6:00 had breakfast and coffee. Cut out cereal and started having only eggs or oatmeal (steel cut, prepped in my Instant Pot - not the crappy packets in a box).

HOLY TOLEDO. I told my husband I feel like someone just flipped my ""on"" switch. I did this every day this week and felt amazing. Brain fog gone, chronic pain way way less, can feel my finger joints again (as opposed to them being lost in puffiness). Yesterday, being the weekend, I slacked off. Still paying for it as of the time of this writing, Sunday morning. Can't wait til 5:00 tomorrow morning to get back on track! 

I'm also on progesterone and still want to ask my Dr about estrogen because I'm not on that and don't know why. I don't have hot ""flashes"" but I'm hot constantly, 24/7, which makes me sweaty and angry (very much not how I've been my whole life).

We just moved into a new place and I find myself picking up after him multiple times in a day. (Socks on couch, drinks without coasters - he ruined our last coffee table by not using coasters, laptop left at the kitchen table, clothes left on the bed - and I mean MULTIPLE shirts and pants. He claims they’re “still clean” so he doesn’t want to put them in our laundry basket, mess over the counter after making food, MULTIPLE EMPTY BOTTLES on his bedside table.)

He also rarely does any cleaning around the place. I have to ask him multiple times and he just grumbles and says he’s tired (he’s a freelance photographer so he chooses his own schedule - there are atleast 3 days in a week he’s home. I’m only home 1 day a week) 
When I asked him multiple times to clean something he then turns it around on me and asks me what my problem is because I’m “always on his back” 

I should also mention that when he gets frustrated instead of being a grown man (he’s 29) the first thing he does is blame himself and say “I’m stupid and it’s all my fault” … when I asked him why he always blames himself he uses the excuse that it’s how his mother raised him to feel like it’s always his fault… like c‘mon. 
I told him to consider counselling because I as well have had some “mommy issues” but his excuse is that he’s seen 2 therapists and didn’t click with them. Tried explaining that you can’t expect to click with the first therapist and it takes time… NOPE. Moving on will not consider a therapist, continuing to curse at himself when things go wrong.

I just feel like I’m taking care of a child at this point and I can’t take it anymore.
I cleaned the whole apartment today guess what he did? Stayed in bed on his phone while I was vacuuming around him.
The other day he was in bed on his phone for HOURS because “the bed is comfy” he didn’t nap. Just scrolling on his phone.
Did I also mention that I’m the one that cooks EVERYDAY? And he “cleans” by throwing things in the dishwasher (plates and glasses stacked on top of each other so they don’t clean? - apparently “his mom didn’t teach him how to use a dishwasher)

Please someone tell me how to get him out of this.

It’s like your nervous system remembers safety before your mind catches up.

Each one is a small time machine—a reminder that joy doesn’t always have to be loud or new. Sometimes it’s as simple as a scent that feels like home.

Backstory: I started xl 150 in March of 2023 and did amazing on it in the beginning. After about 1½ years, I started feeling the depression creeping back so I switched to SR 100 twice a day. I felt ok but still a little flat, especially in the morning when I needed the boost. Coffee just made me tired.  
I started taking 200 in the morning and did not take my 2nd dose in the afternoon, that was perfect for me: by 7 pm I'd start to get a little tired and my 10 pm I'd be ready to sleep.  
I was able to stay on that dose for about 6 months. 
However, within the last 2 months, I noticed I started to feel really amped up, my pulse was racing, my blood pressure was high, and I just felt all around wired but tired.  
I went back to the doctor, and he lowered me back to 150 XL.  
My primary, at the same time, decided to put me on a beta blocker.  
My pulse and blood pressure are starting to calm down, but I'm starting to feel the depression creep back in again. I'm tired, no motivation, just don't have that wonderful Wellbutrin feeling that I am so used to.  
I recently learned about Auvelity and how it helps people who have built a tolerance to Wellbutrin by itself.  
But my question is, is this risky to my heart rate and blood pressure?  
Has anyone switched from bupropion to Auvelity?  
Any worsening cardiovascular side effects?  
And has anyone tried a beta blocker with it?

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

1omjfbx,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1omjfbx/the_legend_of_fairy_lake/,The Legend of fairy lake,"

I’ve been at this long enough that ghost stories don’t get to me anymore. I’ve spent nights in supposedly haunted hotels, camped in the woods where people swear they’ve seen creatures, walked through abandoned hospitals in the dark. Every time, it comes down to the same things: wind, plumbing, fog, shadows. People scare themselves better than anything else can.

So when someone emailed me about Fairy Lake in Quebec, I figured it was another overblown campfire story. They wrote, “She rises every Halloween at midnight. On a full moon, the chief’s daughter sings on the water. And the ones who hear her don’t come back.”

I should’ve rolled my eyes and moved on. But the email had an attachment. A scan of a diary, written in rough French in the 1800s. The last line said, “…they kept the daughter of the chief. She swore the spirits would remember. Tonight, as the moon rose, I heard her voice upon the lake.”

I couldn’t ignore that. I told myself I’d camp there, record the fog, and prove it was nothing more than atmosphere and imagination.

When I got to Chelsea, the nearest town, I started asking questions. People didn’t like that. At the bakery, the woman behind the counter froze when I mentioned the lake. Her hand trembled so badly the coffee sloshed over the cup. She muttered, “Don’t go. If you see her reflection, you’re already hers.” Then she disappeared into the back and never came out again.

At the gas station, an old man behind the counter gave me a dry chuckle when I asked. “Every tourist asks about that lake,” he said. His voice dropped lower. “Hunters vanish. Hikers too. Always this time of year. The lake keeps its promises.”

At the bar, a man with a scar down his cheek leaned close to me over his drink. “She sings,” he whispered. “That’s how you know. We went out there when I was seventeen. Full moon, Halloween night. The water went flat, and then we heard her voice. My friend thought it was some trick. He stayed. I ran. I never saw him again.”

He didn’t smile. He didn’t laugh. He didn’t blink. He just finished his beer and walked out, leaving his glass half full.

The hike out to the lake was harder than I expected. At first, it was normal — the crunch of leaves under my boots, the smell of pine, the occasional scurry of an animal in the underbrush. But the deeper I went, the quieter it got. The birds stopped. The squirrels vanished. Even the insects went silent. By the time the sun dipped below the trees, the forest felt like it was holding its breath.

I caught movement more than once. Tall shapes slipping between the trees. Thin, wrong. When I turned, there was nothing there.

By the time I broke through the tree line and saw the water, my nerves were already frayed. Fairy Lake looked like something from a painting. Perfectly round, rimmed with towering pines leaning toward it like watchmen. Moss crept to the water’s edge, damp and glowing under the rising moon. Mist curled off the surface in silver ribbons. For a moment, I forgot why I was there.

I set up camp on the north bank. Camera rig pointed at the lake, recorder running. I talked into it, trying to keep my voice steady. “Alright, midnight at Fairy Lake. Let’s see what happens.”

At 11:00, the forest went silent. Not quiet. Silent. The wind died all at once. The branches froze. The lake flattened until it looked like glass. My breath fogged even though the air wasn’t that cold.

Then came the smell. Sweet and foul, like rotting leaves stirred into pond scum. It clung at the back of my throat.

I tried to make a joke into the recorder, but my voice sounded too loud. Wrong, like it didn’t belong to the place I was standing.

On the water, I started to notice reflections. Not mine. Dozens of them. Figures standing on the opposite shore, too far away to make out faces. When I shone my flashlight, there was nothing but trees. But when I looked back, the figures were closer.

I stopped looking at the lake.

Midnight came. The moon broke through the clouds and lit the water silver. The lake was so still it looked like another world under glass.

That’s when she appeared.

At first, just a shimmer. A shadow. Then the reflection pulled itself out of the water like peeling skin from a mirror. She rose slow, dripping, until she stood on the surface.

She looked sixteen, maybe younger. Her hair hung wet and tangled with weeds. A dress clung to her thin body, stained dark. Her skin was pale, stretched too tight, and her eyes were black pits.

Her mouth opened.

She began to sing.

The sound wasn’t right. It didn’t come from her lips. It came from everywhere — the water, the trees, the air in my lungs. Warped, doubled, like two voices out of sync.

“By fire we called, by moon we prayed,
The spirits fed us, the hunters stayed.”

The lake shuddered. Bodies rolled beneath the surface, pale hands pressing upward, faces straining like they were trapped under ice.

“The strangers came with iron and flame,
They took my body, they cursed my name.”

The moss writhed under my boots. My feet sank. I couldn’t pull free. It felt like fingers clutching my ankles.

She raised her arm. Her hand was bent wrong, joints twisted backward like snapped branches. She pointed at me.

“Now each full moon, one soul I take,
The spirits hunger at dark Fairy Lake.”

The last word dropped so low it rattled in my chest. The water went still. The whispers stopped.

And she was gone.

I don’t remember tearing down my gear. I remember the forest swallowing me, branches tearing at my face as I ran. I don’t remember unlocking the car. Just the silence breaking as the engine roared to life.

The footage shows nothing. Just me on the shore, staring at still water. No girl. No song. No shadows.

But my boots are still stained black from the moss. I’ve scrubbed them raw and the rot won’t come out.

Three nights later, I woke to the sound of dripping. My ceiling was dry. My floor was dry.

In the mirror across the room, she stood behind me. Her hair was dripping lake water. Her lips were moving, silently forming the words I’d already heard once.

I turned the mirror to the wall. But every night since, I still hear the water.

And Halloween’s coming.

1omjecb,https://www.reddit.com/r/VyvanseADHD/comments/1omjecb/amino_support_to_avoid_crashes/,Amino support to avoid crashes,"TL:DR - some people especially inattentive types lack the precursors needed to make dopamine and norepinephrine which is what us ADHDers need. Proper nutrition and added amino support throughout the day can prevent or minimize these crashes.

In my own ADHD journey I have found some clues here that helped me navigate my journey with Vyvanse and wanted to give back some of the insights I have found in case it helps someone else.

I have inattentive/hyperactive ADHD, very inattentive. On meds for 4-5 months now and have struggled to get full efficacy and avoid crashes, dips and lulls. 47M 190lbs

I have been working hard to fine tune my protein, nutrition, coffee, hydration and eventually (the big missing piece) comprehensive amino support. 

I take 40mg first thing plus a 10mg booster which was supposed to be at noon. Starting out I would get great energy etc for the morning but by mid to late morning I'd hit a hard crash, lose focus, energy and motivation, despite most symptom control remaining. However, feeling that way I couldn't do much and usually lunch would make it worse or if I recovered a bit it would never be to the same level. 

I worked furiously trying to fine tune and sort out the crashes derailing my meds usefulness. I had my meds adjusted and even have a booster but it didn't fix it. It did enable me to more clearly see what was 

I'll get to the point, after a lot of experimentation here are my conclusions:

-Some of us perhaps especially inattentive leaning types may not have enough of the precursors needed to make dopamine and norepinephrine, even with perfect conditions such as protein, nutrition, hydration and rest.

-L-tyrosine alone may not be enough to provide what you need, you may also need a full suite of amino acids. I also use a protein shake, Diesel brand, which has a full set of aminos.

-You may need several top ups of aminos, l-tyrosine, fruit and nut snacks, hydration and coffee to ensure a smooth day without gaps. Avoid acidic and vitamin C food/drink.

-I need constant overlap of all supports and 'maximum resilience measures' to achieve a smooth crashless day.

-Breakfast and lunch need to have sufficient protein and be balanced nutritionally.

With everything lined up and a decent nights sleep I have been able to achieve a smooth day with only an expected natural dip from just before lunch to a little after lunch, involving transitions and digestion. My case may be extreme, not sure. 

Good luck

I would like some advice regarding the stepper motor that controls the drain valve on the brewing unit of the Jura Z6 coffee machine. It stopped letting water through the brewing unit, so I disassembled the coffee machine and found that the stepper motor that controls the drain valve on the brewing unit was extended and would not retract. I bought a new stepper motor and connected the electrical wires to the new stepper motor before installing it in the coffee machine. I found that the new motor behaves the same way, it only extends but will not retract. I am afraid that the control electronic board is defective. Before I order it, I would need to make sure that the stepper motor behaves correctly even before installation so that when preparing coffee, the motor outside the coffee machine and connected to the coffee machine wires will extend and retract. I read somewhere that it must rest on a plastic end in the valve, which may be cracked and therefore the motor rod will not retract. The end cap on my coffee machine is fine and I have tried activating the drain valve a few times by pressing on the plastic in the drain valve and everything seems to be fine, I ordered a metal end cap for the drain valve today and will replace it with the plastic one. Thank you very much to everyone for the advice, have a nice day, best regards František Prokop – Czech Republic.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1omjals,https://www.reddit.com/r/rhoslc/comments/1omjals/i_agree_with_angies_daughter/,I agree with Angie's daughter,"Hello everyone — this is my first post in this sub. I usually just scroll through, but this time I felt like writing because the topic is quite personal to me.

I’m fully expecting to be downvoted since this post is about Angie K., and from what I’ve seen, she’s considered a fan favorite here. So I’ll apologize in advance — all I ask is that you read my reasoning before coming for me 😅. I don’t dislike or particularly like Angie; she’s neutral for me. But I do think she’s a very successful Housewife.

What prompted this post was something Angie’s daughter said in a recent episode. Angie mentioned she was working on getting her Greek citizenship, and her daughter, Elektra, said something like “Mom, enough with the Greek thing.”

That moment really struck a nerve with me, because it touches on something that’s always slightly bothered me about Angie — how she uses her Greek heritage on the show. I know it’s personal, but I wanted to share my perspective.

A bit about me first — I’m a Greek-American woman. I was born and raised in Greece until I was 14. My dad is Greek, from Athens, and my mom is Spanish, from Seville. In 2002, my dad got a great job offer from his company’s HQ, and we moved to Chicago.

We lived in a predominantly Greek neighborhood, so I’ve had plenty of experience with Greek-Americans — or as I sometimes call them, “wannabe Greeks.”

Now, although my mom is Spanish and I was raised with Spanish culture at home — we spoke the language, followed the traditions, celebrated the holidays — I never immersed myself in it enough to claim that identity. I wasn’t raised in Spain, I didn’t live that everyday Spanish experience, so while I respect and love that part of me, I wouldn’t call myself “Spanish.” I’m Greek-American with Spanish roots and influences, not half-Spanish in the cultural sense.

I first started thinking about identity this way when I was in school in Chicago. I met a kid whose father was Belgian but who had grown up his entire life in Kenya. When I said to him, “Oh, so you’re half Belgian,” he immediately said, “No — I’m Kenyan. My father is Belgian.” He explained that even though he had Belgian nationality and spoke perfect Flemish, he didn’t feel Belgian at all because he didn’t grow up there — he didn’t know what life was like for an average Belgian person. That conversation really stuck with me and shaped how I see cultural identity.

Which brings me to Angie. She doesn’t speak Greek very well. I’d estimate her level at maybe A2 (basic). Her pronunciation, accent, and word choices are often off. For instance, in one scene, when her father greeted her with “Welcome,” she replied “Welcome” back — which doesn’t make sense in Greek. Also, she and her father did “cheers” with coffee, which is a big no-no in Greek culture (it’s considered bad luck). It’s such a common cultural understanding that even people who aren’t superstitious avoid it.

She does not even pronounce her daughter's name correctly! 

You might ask — why do I even care? Well, it’s personal.

Growing up as an immigrant kid in Chicago, I often felt the weight of stereotypes about Greeks, “hot-headed,” “lazy,” “loud,” etc. I’ve been judged or underestimated because of them. So when Angie constantly attributes her temper or attitude to being “Greek,” it rubs me the wrong way. She’ll say she’s loud or fiery because of her “Greek blood,” but that’s not fair,  not all Greeks are like that.

I’ve noticed that some Greek-Americans (and honestly, people from many other ethnic backgrounds too) use stereotypes as excuses for behavior. It’s frustrating because it reinforces misconceptions that others like me then have to fight against in school, work, and life.

Recently, I was invited to a Greek-American wedding, and it honestly highlighted this issue even more. The people there followed “Greek traditions” that were actually very local customs from rural areas , many of which have long died out in modern Greece, partly because they’re quite sexist. For example, there was a ceremony meant to “ensure” the woman would have a boy first because “boys are better than girls.” When some American guests asked if that’s what weddings are like in Greece, I said no — absolutely not. But the parents of the couple insisted that it was “common everywhere in Greece,” which is completely false.

The couple themselves didn’t speak a word of Greek. These things might seem harmless on the surface, but they contribute to a bigger problem: how Greek-American communities often preserve outdated or distorted traditions and pass them off as “Greek culture.” The truth is, modern Greece has moved on from a lot of those ideas. Yet in some Greek-American circles, racism, sexism, and even arranged marriages still quietly persist. They’re less forced than in the past, but there’s still huge pressure to “marry Greek,” and marrying a non-Greek can be seen as a big disappointment.

That’s not modern Greece that’s a localized version of Greek culture frozen in time, and it’s unfair to pass it off as representative of the whole country.

Language, in my opinion, is the gateway to culture. You can’t truly claim a culture if you don’t speak the language — at least not deeply. If being Greek is such a huge part of your personality, then learn the language properly.

Angie says her daughter doesn’t “understand her Greekness” — but how can she, if Angie doesn’t speak the language or immerse her in the culture? You can’t expect your child to understand the nuances, expressions, and traditions if they’ve never been part of them.

And about the Greek citizenship thing — that part confused me too. If Angie’s father registered her at a Greek consulate as his child, she’d automatically qualify for citizenship. If not, it’s still a pretty straightforward process — two appointments max. I got both my kids their Greek passports in about 30 minutes total, so I don’t really understand what Angie means by “working towards it.” Maybe it’s a language barrier? Because she does not speak the language good she cannot understand what is needed from her? But I doubt it as all Embassy employees speak perfect English. Who knows.

My main point, though, is this: when people use their nationality to excuse bad behavior or reinforce exaggerated stereotypes, it can harm others from the same background.

I’ve had to constantly prove that I’m not “lazy” or “overly emotional” just because I’m Greek — even though people around me perpetuated those ideas themselves by saying things like, “We’re Greek, we don’t stress, we take it easy.” Meanwhile, anyone who’s lived in Greece knows Greeks are some of the hardest-working (and underpaid) people out there.

This issue isn’t unique to Angie or Greeks, either. On Love Is Blind, there was a Latina woman who said her husband was jealous of her bikini photos and that she “couldn’t help it” because she was Latina — implying Latina women are naturally flirty. Many Latina viewers called her out for reinforcing a stereotype that doesn’t represent them. Similarly, a Brazilian woman on another season said she expected men to pay because “that’s how it is in her culture,” and many Brazilian women spoke up to correct her.

So yeah, while I don’t dislike Angie as a person or a Housewife, I really don’t like how she uses her heritage to justify her behavior, or how she claims Greek identity so strongly while barely speaking the language.

If you’ve ever faced discrimination tied to your ethnicity, I think you’ll understand where I’m coming from and how frustrating and disheartening it is to have someone feed into the same stereotypes that make life harder for others who share that identity.",7,1762095189.0,rhoslc,75,0.51,False

if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

This is probably my bias but I miss the 2000s. I miss how edgy and cool the 90s and early 2000s were. Grunge and Emo culture, edgy shows and bands like MSI and Jackass. Completely uncensored space to say anything and make any sort of art or express any idea regardless of who it offended. Less emphasis on trying to make everything political or tie into a big social message.

Then the 2010s happened and there was this weird corporate positivity thing suddenly going on. Stomp Clap Hey was the big thing. The hipster burger restaurant meme was real, all the sincerity of the past decade was completely gone. Replaced with hipsters in coffee shops feigning for social media points and people who laughed at Jackass 3 years prior claiming they always hated it. 

Portlandia is literally a documentary of that time. That was the culture and I absolutely despised it. Everyone was trying to out progressive themselves while being safe edgy.

 Nothing about the decade was sincere. It was all just people doing shit for social media points. 
 People starting posing with there food and updating there profiles with social causes they clearly didn't care about. Jokes and music they previously liked started becoming problematic 

I could rant forever how much I fucking hate how insincere that entire shitty decade was or how it killed any edge left in culture or media. The decade of the fakest fucking people trying there best to emulate the characters in Portlandia and become them.

1omj0s3,https://www.ft.com/content/4e0a9a30-b014-4745-afe5-c841e36b41da,US accused of ‘bully-boy’ tactics to sink climate deal,"Trump administration officials warned of additional trade tariffs and made personal threats against negotiators from other countries to block a historic climate deal for shipping, said people present at the talks.

More than 10 diplomats, officials from other governments and industry observers told the Financial Times that the US ripped up normal global diplomacy rules and used “bully-boy tactics” to derail the UN-backed Net Zero Framework for global shipping at meetings in London last month.

A phalanx of US officials intimidated African and small Pacific and Caribbean island countries into dropping support for the framework, which would have imposed a carbon emissions levy on shipping, according to people present at the talks at the headquarters of the UN’s International Maritime Organization in London. The US group included eight people, according to one person present.


The intimidation included approaching country officials during coffee breaks to warn them they might not be able to transit via the US, or that they and their families could face restrictions on entering the country if they acted against American interests, according to five people at the talks, including two from countries that were directly threatened.

US President Donald Trump has branded the framework a “global green new scam tax on shipping”, and in a social media post last month called for it to be blocked.

The framework had been provisionally agreed by a majority of countries in April and was expected to be made legally binding last month, but further discussions on its adoption have now been delayed for a year.

While the Trump administration has made no secret of its disdain for the UN and multilateral organisations, diplomats and experts warned that the behaviour at the IMO crossed a line, with potential long-term consequences for global governance.


“It was like the New York street,” said a diplomat from a nation that was threatened with visa restrictions for shipping crews and other penalties, including increased fees to access US ports, if it did not drop its support for the framework.

“They went from delegation to delegation . . . threatening them. Telling them to go back and speak to their capitals, warning what would happen if they didn’t change their minds,” the diplomat said.

A second veteran of IMO meetings said the US tactics had left the entire organisation — usually a forum for technocratic discussion and consensus-based decision making — in a state of “complete shock”. 

“It’s like dealing with the Mob,” the veteran added. “It’s bully-boy tactics. They don’t need to tell you exactly what they’re going to do to you, just make it clear that there will be consequences.”


A State Department official did not address the personal threats to delegates from other countries. But the official commended Greece and Cyprus, which broke ranks with the rest of the EU and abstained from a vote to adjourn talks for a year, having previously approved the framework in April.

In a statement issued before the meetings in London, US secretary of state Marco Rubio said the Trump administration was “evaluating sanctions on officials sponsoring activist-driven climate policies that would burden American consumers, among other measures under consideration”.

Creon Butler, head of global economy at Chatham House, said breaking with diplomatic tradition and using leverage to force other countries to comply with its approach to issues such as climate change carried long-term risks for US influence. 

“In the very short term this might work, but in the medium term it increases the chances that non-US countries will conclude they cannot work with the US, making agreements independently among themselves which simply work around the US,” he said.


Several nations, including Brazil, warned at last month’s meeting that “methods that should not ever be used among sovereign nations” had been deployed to scupper the Net Zero Framework, but without providing specifics.

People who attended the IMO talks said US intimidation was directed both at individuals and capitals, with many countries, including Bangladesh, Japan and Indonesia, receiving diplomatic démarches — formal diplomatic protests — warning of retaliation.

One démarche seen by the Financial Times used diplomatic language to warn of “reciprocal measures” against countries that backed the Net Zero Framework. These included levying additional trade tariffs, increasing fees on their ships when they docked at US ports, higher disembarkation levies and threatening to revoke US visas of crew members.

“There was a combination of economic threats, which were reiterated on the floor, as well as very personal delegate-level threats, including threats to visas,” said one IMO delegate, who had conferred with several countries about the threats they had experienced from the US, but asked to remain anonymous because there “is so much fear about retaliation”.

Another country delegate said some negotiators had been told they would face restrictions if they planned to travel home via the US.

“We had some very specific threats made to us. They are clearly thinking about which levers could be applied to each country,” the person said. “Everyone was surprised by the extent of [the] pressure.”

Another delegate said that before the meeting in London, the US had contacted countries around the world, including rich nations, warning that “individual delegation members could be put on a sanctions list,” with the expectation they would face visa restrictions if they backed the framework. 

Those threats were then reiterated in London, they added. “It was completely exceptional. I have never heard of anything like this in the context of an IMO negotiation. These people [being threatened] are just bureaucrats, they are civil servants,” the person said.

Although the Net Zero Framework was delayed for one year, delegates said that as long as Trump remained in the White House it was hard to imagine how the agreement could come into force.

Talks on technical standards for the deal have since continued but several delegates acknowledged they were largely futile. ",29,1762094541.0,geopolitics,5,0.89,False

1omizar,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheUnwantedUndead/comments/1omizar/meaning_of_life/,meaning of life,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

recently I've got a task to implement client-side CSV export for data stored in MUI DataGridPro with a strict requirement to stream export directly to users file system (no browser in-memory storing).  
This task been easy to implement for Chrome and Chrome-based browsers with native File System API.

But freaking Safari and Firefox got me lots of coffee cups and wasted weekend - I just cannot access user file system, and the best and memory-efiicient way I have found is to export via Blob API without storing actual data in browser but rather keep it as reference:

    User clicks Export → WritableStream created (in-memory)

    Header written → BOM + column names → Immediately converted to Blob
      - Raw Uint8Array: Garbage collected
      - Blob reference stored (lightweight)

      - Browser combines all Blob references internally (no JS heap copy)
      - Download triggered via <a> link
    ↓
    File downloads from browser

But I still believe that it is not the most efficient way to do that. Currently we have customers with 1 000 000 + rows data in one table, average is 170k rows.

I think I’ll start by saying that I love my mom a lot. She has become an abusive parent ever since my dad passed. There are several occasions where she would hit me and apologize like it didn’t happen. But several days ago, she literally threw a hot coffee on me which left me with burns on my thighs. The problem is I look so much like my dad and I think everytime she sees me I remind me of my dad.

My bestfriend dad brought me at a clinic yesterday and it was a 2nd degree burn and they prescribed some medications.

I’m currently safe at a motel but I have to leave the place tomorrow and stay on the streets until Tuesday. Thats the day that my aunt would fly and pick me up to leave with her. Was thinking of going to the police to seek shelter for a day or two and for some food but I’m scared that they might arrest my mom if I do?

I'm planning a solo trip to northern Thailand in the **second half of November 2025** \- starting from Bangkok (2 days there, mainly for street photography and to feel the local vibe, not tourist spots).

I’ve already checked Wikivoyage and some blogs, but couldn't find much about more spontaneous, off-grid experiences - so maybe someone here has first-hand insights?

**About me and travel style:**  
\- No fixed itinerary, I like to go with the flow and decide on the spot.  
\- Budget: flexible, but I enjoy local and lowkey places.  
\- Interests: people, culture, photography, local coffee, quiet villages, authentic moments.

**Questions:**  
1. Is sleeping outdoors (under the sky/in nature) legal and safe in northern Thailand? If so, would a light sleeping bag be enough for November nights? (\~12-18C), theory is different from the reality so it'd be nice to get info from the first hand.  
2. For 2 weeks with a 40 L backpack, is there anything specific you'd recommend packing (clothes or gear) for that region?  
3. Any less-known places or experiences you'd recommend in the north? I'm more into authentic people and landscapes than big attractions.

The stone was covered in frost, which instantly evaporated. After a few seconds, it began to glow a dull red, and then a bright orange. A wave of dry, wonderful heat spread across the square. Despite their fear, the inhabitants slowly began to approach this new, artificial sun. They held out their hands, feeling a warmth that no kaloki lamp had ever given them.

""The stone is practically heated to the temperature of magma,"" Anna stated, more to herself than to them. ""It will radiate heat for a few hours.""

The Scribe, who had been watching everything with a mixture of terror and scientific fascination, approached. He bypassed Korin and Orin, staring at the glowing rock.

""Incredible..."" he whispered. ""Once, long ago, I saw energy erupt from the earth. Such glowing rocks fell from the sky. But you... you created one here. On command.""

He looked at Anna with religious reverence. This was no longer just a being. This was a power that wielded fire in a world where fire was a myth.

A few days passed. The fear in Rhun slowly gave way to a wary, almost painful curiosity. The visitors, who had landed in their fireless boats, kept their word. They did not attack. Instead, on the plain beyond the walls, they began to build.

The Dakani watched from the walls and watchtowers. They watched as the visitors removed their metal helmets, which had inspired the most terror, replacing them with smaller, transparent masks that covered only their furless faces. They now moved more freely, as if acclimating to the world and its gravity.

Their ""huts"" were erected at a speed that was magic to the Dakani. They didn't use stone or clay. From the smaller boats, which still descended majestically from the great star-ship hanging in the sky, they unloaded large, smooth, light-colored panels. These materials joined together without mortar, forming perfectly straight, gleaming homes within hours.

More disturbingly for the city guard, the visitors were setting up some very dangerous-looking machines. They were long, metal tubes on rotating bases, all pointed at the bright violet sky, as if challenging the gods themselves.

Magaja was curious. More than others. Fear battled with the hunger for knowledge that the Scribe had instilled in her. She had to see it up close. Under the cover of dusk, as most of Rhun's inhabitants hid in their homes, she slipped out of her house through a side passage. She crawled through the tall, purplish grass until she reached the edge of the visitors' camp, which was lit by a strange, white light. She hid behind a large, metal crate – an unloading area.

There were several of them there. They sat on crates, helmets off, in their strange, tight-fitting suits. They only had those small, transparent masks on their faces. They were laughing. Magaja had never heard such laughter – it was loud, free, full of air. They spoke in a foreign, barking language.

One of them, a powerfully built man with pale skin, stood up and stretched with a loud groan.

""Feels good to stretch my bones and feel gravity after almost 50 years,"" he said in his language.

Magaja frowned. She didn't know what that meant. Suddenly, from a helmet lying on the crate right next to her, the same mechanical, emotionless voice she had heard at the gate spoke.

""Translation: Feels good to stretch my bones and feel gravity after almost 50 years.""

Magaja held her breath, pressing a hand to her mouth. The helmet was translating into her language. Fifty years?

Another figure, a woman with dark skin, handed the man a mug of steaming liquid.

Karl drank. ""At least they gave us coffee to drink.""

The woman asked. ""And how is progress with the oceans? Have the modified amoebas been deployed in their oceans yet?""

""Translation: Have the modified amoebas been deployed in their oceans yet?""

The man she called Karl nodded.

""Yes, the Science division confirmed. Deployment complete. Apparently, within two of our years, they'll increase the oxygen level to 15%. We'll finally be able to breathe normally here and light an open fire, which will make the rest of the mission easier.""

""Translation: Apparently, within two years, they'll increase the oxygen level to 15%. We'll finally be able to light an open fire…""

Magaja felt her head spin. An open fire? The fulfillment of every Dakani's dream.

The female visitor snorted.

""First, let's teach them to wash. But they stink. That fur is soaked in... everything.""

""Translation: But they stink.""

""It's true,"" Karl agreed. ""But you can't blame them. Winter is coming. In this atmosphere, without antibiotics, a simple bath in cold water means pneumonia and death.""

""It really is the dark ages,"" the woman summarized. ""But we were lucky with our Earth and atmosphere. Our 21% oxygen is a luxury.""

""Translation: We were lucky with our Earth and atmosphere.""

Magaja slowly retreated into the darkness, her heart pounding like a hammer. She had more questions than answers. Amoebas? Oxygen? Earth? She knew one thing. These visitors were not gods. They were beings of flesh and blood who complained about the smell and rejoiced at gravity. But they possessed a power the Dakani had not even dreamed of – the power to change the very air they breathed.

Days passed, and the visitors' camp outside the walls grew at an alarming, magical pace. The smooth, white buildings, which the Dakani still called ""huts,"" gleamed in the daylight, while the old, stone Rhun seemed fragile and primitive beside them.

The city's leader, Orin, stood in the central square. In his hands, he held the gift he had received from Anna Biggs – the metal, smooth tool for heating the stone. Every few hours, with reverence and almost religious care, he would approach the great meeting stone, which for generations had been the cold heart of the city. Following the visitors' instructions, he aimed the device at the rock.

The silent stream of blue energy struck it again, and within minutes, the stone glowed a deep, orange-red. A wave of wonderful, dry heat spread across the square. The Dakani immediately gathered around it, holding out their fur-covered hands to soak in the luxury.

Next to Orin stood the guard commander, Korin. He no longer wore his sword at his belt. The weapon, once a symbol of his status, now seemed like a pathetic toy.

""I touched their helmet,"" Korin muttered, staring at the Guard soldiers patrolling the city. ""They let me hold it. It's heavy, but perfectly smooth. Our best sword is useless. It would break on that armor without leaving a scratch.""

He sighed. ""Thank the ancestors they aren't aggressive. They would have destroyed us in a single morning.""

Orin wasn't listening. His gaze was distant, fixed on the pulsing heat of the warmed stone. His thoughts revolved around a much darker subject. They revolved around death.

""Do you see what I have in my hand?"" the city leader replied quietly, indicating the device. ""Last winter, we lost three children and seven elders from my own district. They froze to death in their sleep, in their homes. That was a normal winter. A good winter, not a harsh one.""

His voice trembled, and a pain appeared in his dark eyes that Korin had never seen in him before.

""And now I look at this 'thing'. At this gift. And I wonder... how many of our ancestors would have survived all those hundreds of winters? How many of the sick would have lived if we had this thing sooner? Our entire history, Korin... is a history of fighting the cold. Death from cold is as natural to us as breathing. And they..."" he glanced toward the gleaming camp, ""...they brought us the sun in their hand and treat it as something ordinary.""

Their reflections were interrupted by a commotion at the gate. Three messengers ran into the city. Their fur was matted with sweat and dust, and steam rose from their muzzles. They fell to their knees before Orin, breathing heavily.

""Messengers from other cities have arrived!"" someone in the square shouted.

""Leader of Rhun! They are everywhere!"" the first one wheezed.

""Even in the capital!"" shouted the second. ""They landed in the King's Great Square! They are building their gleaming houses there too!""

""In other regions as well!"" added the third, catching his breath. ""Even in the Ashlands... with our enemies! The same great star-ship. The same metal soldiers!""

Orin and Korin looked at each other. The warmth radiating from the stone suddenly ceased to matter. The enemy they had been fighting for generations had received the same help.

""Our kings do not know what to do,"" the messenger finished, his voice holding final surrender. ""How can you fight someone who is everywhere? How do you negotiate with someone who is also talking to your greatest enemy?""

Winter passed. For the city's leader, Orin, it was the first winter he could remember in years without counting losses. No one had frozen. Not one child, not one elder. Thanks to the help of the visitors and their strange, warm panels, the population of Rhun had survived the harsh frosts untouched. For Orin, whose entire political life during this period had consisted of managing the scarcity of heat, this was something unknown and still impossible to fully comprehend.

He sat in the largest tavern in the city. The hubbub of conversation was louder than usual, and in the air hung a smell that had recently been unattainable: the aroma of quickly fried, hot meat. He looked at the gift he had received from Anna Biggs – a gleaming, metal cooking burner. He thought it was magic. An eternal flame. From the smooth surface, a clean, blue fire emerged, one that didn't smoke and didn't need a single gram of precious kaloki. To light a normal fire this large would have required as much kaloki as the city's only smith used in an entire day.

Now, food was cooked quickly, over a high flame, not stewed for hours on a tiny, barely smoldering ember. The tavern keepers, initially terrified of this technology, had learned to use the gift instantly.

Among the guests, at a table in the corner, sat two visitors. Humans. They had already removed their armor and masks, only breathing from them occasionally. Their pale, furless faces were strange, but after several weeks, the Dakani were starting to get used to them. They were waiting for a meal. A real meal. They had been in the Guard for years, and their diet for almost 50 years had consisted solely of tablets and paste from military rations.

""Jesus, man, do you smell that?"" one, the younger, muttered to the other. ""Real food.""

""Let's hope. The ship's doctor said their meat wouldn't harm us, and the vegetables are fully compatible with our digestive system. After so many years of regeneration formula, my stomach has probably forgotten how to digest.""

""God, a meal. A real meal,"" the second one sighed, staring at the kitchen as if it were a temple.

The Dakani tavern keeper, hesitating slightly, served them steaming stew in wooden bowls and handed them wooden spoons. The visitors threw themselves at the food. They ate both portions in a second or two. The sound of spoons hitting the bottom of the bowls was the only thing that broke the silence in the tavern.

They breathed deeply, almost in unison, smiling at each other and at the tavern keeper, who was staring at them in astonishment.

""Thank you,"" the older one said, his voice slightly hoarse with emotion. ""That's the best thing we've eaten in years.""

The tavern keeper smiled broadly, baring his teeth. ""Want a drink? We have a strong brew...""

""We can't,"" the younger soldier interrupted, with genuine, deep regret in his voice. ""On duty. But we're off tomorrow. We'll be back. For sure.""

While the ordinary Dakani were learning to coexist with the soldiers over food, the Scribe was learning to understand the world. He had been invited inside the great, metal star hanging over the city. What he saw changed his perception of reality forever.

Everything his knowledge-hungry mind could comprehend was explained to him. The basics of chemistry. Physics. The visitors, through patient explanations and moving diagrams, explained to him why fire was so rare on their planet – the low oxygen content in the atmosphere.

And then they showed him his world. From above. From orbit. He saw that his world was not a flat land under a firmament, but a sphere, suspended in an infinite, black void. They showed him pictures of other planets, other suns, and Earth.

His task now was to pass this knowledge on to others. He had to start from the basics, from explaining that rain was not the tears of the gods, and stars were not the eyes of ancestors. He had to do it in a way that would not instill fear in them, not destroy their-culture, but slowly enrich it. The Scribe returned to the surface as the first teacher of a new era, feeling a weight on his shoulders that no Dakani had ever borne.

Spring came. The first winter in Dakani memory where no one froze had passed. The stone city of Rhun, which for the past few months had huddled around the boulders heated by the Guard, was now awakening to a new life.

Magaja was heading to school. It was no longer just a sporadic meeting at the foot of the tower. The visitors had helped the Scribe organize a real classroom in one of the new, gleaming buildings. The Scribe taught daily, but now one of the human engineers stood beside him. Together, they imparted basic knowledge about the world, explaining the laws of physics and chemistry, which for the Dakani had until now been the domain of the gods.

The biggest change came with the darkness. Electricity appeared. Magaja remembered the terror in her mother's eyes when the Guard soldiers installed a ""fireless lamp"" in their home.

""Gods, electricity! Light at night! It's magic!"" she had shouted when the glass bulb flared to life with a bright, steady light, stronger than a thousand kaloki lamps.

""It's not magic, Mother,"" Magaja explained patiently, repeating the Scribe's words. ""It's science.""

The human factories were built very quickly. From the great star-ship, still hanging in the sky like a stationary moon, more machines descended. Strange, multi-legged vehicles moved toward a nearby canyon. As the Dakani were told, it was rich in resources the visitors needed. Without the involvement of a single Dakani, the machines began to extract ore, crush rock, and smelt it in furnaces powered by the same mysterious ""energy.""

But the most important change reached the ordinary homes. Small burners, similar to the one in the tavern, appeared in every household. The Guardsmen didn't just hand them out – they hired local smiths to produce them. The Dakani themselves began to manufacture them and sent messengers to all known cities and villages, even those with whom they were in conflict.

The biggest revolution, however, was invisible. In school, it was explained that the ""modified amoebas"" the Guard had deployed in the oceans were working. Over the last year, the oxygen level in the atmosphere had been slowly but steadily rising. It had already reached 12.4%.

This was still too little for humans without masks, but for the Dakani, it meant a breakthrough. One evening, when the wind died down, Magaja did something that had been impossible until now. She took ordinary, dry wood and a simple flint and steel from a soldier. She didn't use a single gram of precious kaloki. A spark fell on the tinder and, to her amazement, it didn't go out. It began to smolder. When Magaja blew gently, a small, real, open flame burst forth.

Fire. For the first time in their race's history, fire was available to everyone. Even in places the Guard had not yet reached, the air was becoming richer, and fire easier to light.

Another few months passed. Summer arrived. The enriched air, now at 14% oxygen, brought a revolution, but also new, unknown dangers.

One afternoon, a scream tore through the square in Rhun, the likes of which no one had ever heard. It was not a cry of fear of the visitors or of hunger. It was a cry of pure, incomprehensible panic.

""Fire! It's burning! Fire!""

Magaja, who was just returning from school, saw a crowd of Dakani staring at one of the houses near the walls. The house was on fire. It was a sight so alien, so unreal, that hundreds of residents stood paralyzed. Fire was no longer a small, controlled flame in a burner or a kaloki lamp. It was a living, roaring monster. Orange tongues licked the wooden structure of the wall, and thick, black smoke – a sight completely new to them – billowed into the sky.

The residents were stunned and helpless. Some tried to throw buckets of water on the flames, but the fire was already so large that the water instantly evaporated with a loud hiss, and the flames only grew larger. They did not understand how something so desired could become so destructive.

Then, one of the Guardsmen patrolling the city pushed through the crowd. He wasn't running for water. In his hand, he held a strange, red container. He ran up to the burning wall, pulled the pin, and aimed the nozzle at the fire.

A cloud of thick, white powder shot out of the container. The powder instantly smothered the flames. Where the fire had raged just moments before, only a charred wall and a white coating remained. The fire was out in seconds.

The Guardsman turned to the shocked Dakani, who were looking at him as if he were a miracle worker. He lifted his transparent oxygen mask and smiled.

""Alright now. You have to be careful with fire. Now that you have plenty of it, you also have to learn to fear it.""

In orbit above the planet, in the silence of the flagship battleship Tiberius's bridge, Vice Admiral Volkov 2 observed the scene on the main screen. The live feed from the helmet of one of the guards on patrol showed the chaos in the streets of Rhun – the Dakani's panic and the rapidly spreading flames.

Volkov 2 stood on the bridge, his slender, Ullan silhouette clad in a human admiral's uniform. It was the first fire on the surface he had seen since their arrival. He watched as the fire instantly consumed the primitive, wooden structure. Their wood is more flammable than Earth's, he thought. Or perhaps it's just the effect of the jump in oxygen content? Everything that had barely smoldered here for millennia had now become tinder.

He watched as the guardsman calmly extinguished the fire with foam from the red container and then calmed the natives. The Guard's mission was to protect, but their very presence was fundamentally changing this world. This thought raised serious concerns in his mind about the biosphere. He turned to the science officer, who was monitoring planetary readings.

""Will the modified amoebas we released into the oceans not threaten their biosphere and life? We are accelerating this planet's evolution in a way we cannot fully control.""

The science officer, a young woman with a focused expression, immediately displayed the data on her terminal.

""Vice Admiral, the simulations indicate that none of the planet's major ecosystems will suffer. The amoebas are designed to process carbon dioxide and release oxygen, but their population is self-regulating and will die off once it reaches our target threshold. There will be fires, that is inevitable, until the Dakani learn respect for open flame. There will also be natural fires from electrical discharges, lightning. Fortunately, 80% of the planet is covered in forest. The natives only used wood as a building material, not for fuel as we once did. Their world has a vast ecosystem of trees; a few hundred natural fires will not deplete that supply.""

Volkov 2 nodded. Logical. But the risk still existed.

""However, I recommend,"" the officer added, ""that we maintain and limit the increase of the oxygen level in the atmosphere to 15%. This is the minimum value needed for us to breathe without a mask, and at the same time, it should not cause a global ecological catastrophe. A further increase would be too risky, especially since their wood is highly flammable compared to Earth's.""

""Understood. Maintain 15%. So be it,"" Volkov 2 ordered. He looked back at the screen, where the calmed Dakani were touching the charred but saved wall with awe. They were like children who had been given the most dangerous toy in the universe.

The stone was covered in frost, which instantly evaporated. After a few seconds, it began to glow a dull red, and then a bright orange. A wave of dry, wonderful heat spread across the square. Despite their fear, the inhabitants slowly began to approach this new, artificial sun. They held out their hands, feeling a warmth that no kaloki lamp had ever given them.

""The stone is practically heated to the temperature of magma,"" Anna stated, more to herself than to them. ""It will radiate heat for a few hours.""

The Scribe, who had been watching everything with a mixture of terror and scientific fascination, approached. He bypassed Korin and Orin, staring at the glowing rock.

""Incredible..."" he whispered. ""Once, long ago, I saw energy erupt from the earth. Such glowing rocks fell from the sky. But you... you created one here. On command.""

He looked at Anna with religious reverence. This was no longer just a being. This was a power that wielded fire in a world where fire was a myth.

A few days passed. The fear in Rhun slowly gave way to a wary, almost painful curiosity. The visitors, who had landed in their fireless boats, kept their word. They did not attack. Instead, on the plain beyond the walls, they began to build.

The Dakani watched from the walls and watchtowers. They watched as the visitors removed their metal helmets, which had inspired the most terror, replacing them with smaller, transparent masks that covered only their furless faces. They now moved more freely, as if acclimating to the world and its gravity.

Their ""huts"" were erected at a speed that was magic to the Dakani. They didn't use stone or clay. From the smaller boats, which still descended majestically from the great star-ship hanging in the sky, they unloaded large, smooth, light-colored panels. These materials joined together without mortar, forming perfectly straight, gleaming homes within hours.

More disturbingly for the city guard, the visitors were setting up some very dangerous-looking machines. They were long, metal tubes on rotating bases, all pointed at the bright violet sky, as if challenging the gods themselves.

Magaja was curious. More than others. Fear battled with the hunger for knowledge that the Scribe had instilled in her. She had to see it up close. Under the cover of dusk, as most of Rhun's inhabitants hid in their homes, she slipped out of her house through a side passage. She crawled through the tall, purplish grass until she reached the edge of the visitors' camp, which was lit by a strange, white light. She hid behind a large, metal crate – an unloading area.

There were several of them there. They sat on crates, helmets off, in their strange, tight-fitting suits. They only had those small, transparent masks on their faces. They were laughing. Magaja had never heard such laughter – it was loud, free, full of air. They spoke in a foreign, barking language.

One of them, a powerfully built man with pale skin, stood up and stretched with a loud groan.

""Feels good to stretch my bones and feel gravity after almost 50 years,"" he said in his language.

Magaja frowned. She didn't know what that meant. Suddenly, from a helmet lying on the crate right next to her, the same mechanical, emotionless voice she had heard at the gate spoke.

""Translation: Feels good to stretch my bones and feel gravity after almost 50 years.""

Magaja held her breath, pressing a hand to her mouth. The helmet was translating into her language. Fifty years?

Another figure, a woman with dark skin, handed the man a mug of steaming liquid.

Karl drank. ""At least they gave us coffee to drink.""

The woman asked. ""And how is progress with the oceans? Have the modified amoebas been deployed in their oceans yet?""

""Translation: Have the modified amoebas been deployed in their oceans yet?""

The man she called Karl nodded.

""Yes, the Science division confirmed. Deployment complete. Apparently, within two of our years, they'll increase the oxygen level to 15%. We'll finally be able to breathe normally here and light an open fire, which will make the rest of the mission easier.""

""Translation: Apparently, within two years, they'll increase the oxygen level to 15%. We'll finally be able to light an open fire…""

Magaja felt her head spin. An open fire? The fulfillment of every Dakani's dream.

The female visitor snorted.

""First, let's teach them to wash. But they stink. That fur is soaked in... everything.""

""Translation: But they stink.""

""It's true,"" Karl agreed. ""But you can't blame them. Winter is coming. In this atmosphere, without antibiotics, a simple bath in cold water means pneumonia and death.""

""It really is the dark ages,"" the woman summarized. ""But we were lucky with our Earth and atmosphere. Our 21% oxygen is a luxury.""

""Translation: We were lucky with our Earth and atmosphere.""

Magaja slowly retreated into the darkness, her heart pounding like a hammer. She had more questions than answers. Amoebas? Oxygen? Earth? She knew one thing. These visitors were not gods. They were beings of flesh and blood who complained about the smell and rejoiced at gravity. But they possessed a power the Dakani had not even dreamed of – the power to change the very air they breathed.

Days passed, and the visitors' camp outside the walls grew at an alarming, magical pace. The smooth, white buildings, which the Dakani still called ""huts,"" gleamed in the daylight, while the old, stone Rhun seemed fragile and primitive beside them.

The city's leader, Orin, stood in the central square. In his hands, he held the gift he had received from Anna Biggs – the metal, smooth tool for heating the stone. Every few hours, with reverence and almost religious care, he would approach the great meeting stone, which for generations had been the cold heart of the city. Following the visitors' instructions, he aimed the device at the rock.

The silent stream of blue energy struck it again, and within minutes, the stone glowed a deep, orange-red. A wave of wonderful, dry heat spread across the square. The Dakani immediately gathered around it, holding out their fur-covered hands to soak in the luxury.

Next to Orin stood the guard commander, Korin. He no longer wore his sword at his belt. The weapon, once a symbol of his status, now seemed like a pathetic toy.

""I touched their helmet,"" Korin muttered, staring at the Guard soldiers patrolling the city. ""They let me hold it. It's heavy, but perfectly smooth. Our best sword is useless. It would break on that armor without leaving a scratch.""

He sighed. ""Thank the ancestors they aren't aggressive. They would have destroyed us in a single morning.""

Orin wasn't listening. His gaze was distant, fixed on the pulsing heat of the warmed stone. His thoughts revolved around a much darker subject. They revolved around death.

""Do you see what I have in my hand?"" the city leader replied quietly, indicating the device. ""Last winter, we lost three children and seven elders from my own district. They froze to death in their sleep, in their homes. That was a normal winter. A good winter, not a harsh one.""

His voice trembled, and a pain appeared in his dark eyes that Korin had never seen in him before.

""And now I look at this 'thing'. At this gift. And I wonder... how many of our ancestors would have survived all those hundreds of winters? How many of the sick would have lived if we had this thing sooner? Our entire history, Korin... is a history of fighting the cold. Death from cold is as natural to us as breathing. And they..."" he glanced toward the gleaming camp, ""...they brought us the sun in their hand and treat it as something ordinary.""

Their reflections were interrupted by a commotion at the gate. Three messengers ran into the city. Their fur was matted with sweat and dust, and steam rose from their muzzles. They fell to their knees before Orin, breathing heavily.

""Messengers from other cities have arrived!"" someone in the square shouted.

""Leader of Rhun! They are everywhere!"" the first one wheezed.

""Even in the capital!"" shouted the second. ""They landed in the King's Great Square! They are building their gleaming houses there too!""

""In other regions as well!"" added the third, catching his breath. ""Even in the Ashlands... with our enemies! The same great star-ship. The same metal soldiers!""

Orin and Korin looked at each other. The warmth radiating from the stone suddenly ceased to matter. The enemy they had been fighting for generations had received the same help.

""Our kings do not know what to do,"" the messenger finished, his voice holding final surrender. ""How can you fight someone who is everywhere? How do you negotiate with someone who is also talking to your greatest enemy?""

Winter passed. For the city's leader, Orin, it was the first winter he could remember in years without counting losses. No one had frozen. Not one child, not one elder. Thanks to the help of the visitors and their strange, warm panels, the population of Rhun had survived the harsh frosts untouched. For Orin, whose entire political life during this period had consisted of managing the scarcity of heat, this was something unknown and still impossible to fully comprehend.

He sat in the largest tavern in the city. The hubbub of conversation was louder than usual, and in the air hung a smell that had recently been unattainable: the aroma of quickly fried, hot meat. He looked at the gift he had received from Anna Biggs – a gleaming, metal cooking burner. He thought it was magic. An eternal flame. From the smooth surface, a clean, blue fire emerged, one that didn't smoke and didn't need a single gram of precious kaloki. To light a normal fire this large would have required as much kaloki as the city's only smith used in an entire day.

Now, food was cooked quickly, over a high flame, not stewed for hours on a tiny, barely smoldering ember. The tavern keepers, initially terrified of this technology, had learned to use the gift instantly.

Among the guests, at a table in the corner, sat two visitors. Humans. They had already removed their armor and masks, only breathing from them occasionally. Their pale, furless faces were strange, but after several weeks, the Dakani were starting to get used to them. They were waiting for a meal. A real meal. They had been in the Guard for years, and their diet for almost 50 years had consisted solely of tablets and paste from military rations.

""Jesus, man, do you smell that?"" one, the younger, muttered to the other. ""Real food.""

""Let's hope. The ship's doctor said their meat wouldn't harm us, and the vegetables are fully compatible with our digestive system. After so many years of regeneration formula, my stomach has probably forgotten how to digest.""

""God, a meal. A real meal,"" the second one sighed, staring at the kitchen as if it were a temple.

The Dakani tavern keeper, hesitating slightly, served them steaming stew in wooden bowls and handed them wooden spoons. The visitors threw themselves at the food. They ate both portions in a second or two. The sound of spoons hitting the bottom of the bowls was the only thing that broke the silence in the tavern.

They breathed deeply, almost in unison, smiling at each other and at the tavern keeper, who was staring at them in astonishment.

""Thank you,"" the older one said, his voice slightly hoarse with emotion. ""That's the best thing we've eaten in years.""

The tavern keeper smiled broadly, baring his teeth. ""Want a drink? We have a strong brew...""

""We can't,"" the younger soldier interrupted, with genuine, deep regret in his voice. ""On duty. But we're off tomorrow. We'll be back. For sure.""

While the ordinary Dakani were learning to coexist with the soldiers over food, the Scribe was learning to understand the world. He had been invited inside the great, metal star hanging over the city. What he saw changed his perception of reality forever.

Everything his knowledge-hungry mind could comprehend was explained to him. The basics of chemistry. Physics. The visitors, through patient explanations and moving diagrams, explained to him why fire was so rare on their planet – the low oxygen content in the atmosphere.

And then they showed him his world. From above. From orbit. He saw that his world was not a flat land under a firmament, but a sphere, suspended in an infinite, black void. They showed him pictures of other planets, other suns, and Earth.

His task now was to pass this knowledge on to others. He had to start from the basics, from explaining that rain was not the tears of the gods, and stars were not the eyes of ancestors. He had to do it in a way that would not instill fear in them, not destroy their-culture, but slowly enrich it. The Scribe returned to the surface as the first teacher of a new era, feeling a weight on his shoulders that no Dakani had ever borne.

Spring came. The first winter in Dakani memory where no one froze had passed. The stone city of Rhun, which for the past few months had huddled around the boulders heated by the Guard, was now awakening to a new life.

Magaja was heading to school. It was no longer just a sporadic meeting at the foot of the tower. The visitors had helped the Scribe organize a real classroom in one of the new, gleaming buildings. The Scribe taught daily, but now one of the human engineers stood beside him. Together, they imparted basic knowledge about the world, explaining the laws of physics and chemistry, which for the Dakani had until now been the domain of the gods.

The biggest change came with the darkness. Electricity appeared. Magaja remembered the terror in her mother's eyes when the Guard soldiers installed a ""fireless lamp"" in their home.

""Gods, electricity! Light at night! It's magic!"" she had shouted when the glass bulb flared to life with a bright, steady light, stronger than a thousand kaloki lamps.

""It's not magic, Mother,"" Magaja explained patiently, repeating the Scribe's words. ""It's science.""

The human factories were built very quickly. From the great star-ship, still hanging in the sky like a stationary moon, more machines descended. Strange, multi-legged vehicles moved toward a nearby canyon. As the Dakani were told, it was rich in resources the visitors needed. Without the involvement of a single Dakani, the machines began to extract ore, crush rock, and smelt it in furnaces powered by the same mysterious ""energy.""

But the most important change reached the ordinary homes. Small burners, similar to the one in the tavern, appeared in every household. The Guardsmen didn't just hand them out – they hired local smiths to produce them. The Dakani themselves began to manufacture them and sent messengers to all known cities and villages, even those with whom they were in conflict.

The biggest revolution, however, was invisible. In school, it was explained that the ""modified amoebas"" the Guard had deployed in the oceans were working. Over the last year, the oxygen level in the atmosphere had been slowly but steadily rising. It had already reached 12.4%.

This was still too little for humans without masks, but for the Dakani, it meant a breakthrough. One evening, when the wind died down, Magaja did something that had been impossible until now. She took ordinary, dry wood and a simple flint and steel from a soldier. She didn't use a single gram of precious kaloki. A spark fell on the tinder and, to her amazement, it didn't go out. It began to smolder. When Magaja blew gently, a small, real, open flame burst forth.

Fire. For the first time in their race's history, fire was available to everyone. Even in places the Guard had not yet reached, the air was becoming richer, and fire easier to light.

Another few months passed. Summer arrived. The enriched air, now at 14% oxygen, brought a revolution, but also new, unknown dangers.

One afternoon, a scream tore through the square in Rhun, the likes of which no one had ever heard. It was not a cry of fear of the visitors or of hunger. It was a cry of pure, incomprehensible panic.

""Fire! It's burning! Fire!""

Magaja, who was just returning from school, saw a crowd of Dakani staring at one of the houses near the walls. The house was on fire. It was a sight so alien, so unreal, that hundreds of residents stood paralyzed. Fire was no longer a small, controlled flame in a burner or a kaloki lamp. It was a living, roaring monster. Orange tongues licked the wooden structure of the wall, and thick, black smoke – a sight completely new to them – billowed into the sky.

The residents were stunned and helpless. Some tried to throw buckets of water on the flames, but the fire was already so large that the water instantly evaporated with a loud hiss, and the flames only grew larger. They did not understand how something so desired could become so destructive.

Then, one of the Guardsmen patrolling the city pushed through the crowd. He wasn't running for water. In his hand, he held a strange, red container. He ran up to the burning wall, pulled the pin, and aimed the nozzle at the fire.

A cloud of thick, white powder shot out of the container. The powder instantly smothered the flames. Where the fire had raged just moments before, only a charred wall and a white coating remained. The fire was out in seconds.

The Guardsman turned to the shocked Dakani, who were looking at him as if he were a miracle worker. He lifted his transparent oxygen mask and smiled.

""Alright now. You have to be careful with fire. Now that you have plenty of it, you also have to learn to fear it.""

In orbit above the planet, in the silence of the flagship battleship Tiberius's bridge, Vice Admiral Volkov 2 observed the scene on the main screen. The live feed from the helmet of one of the guards on patrol showed the chaos in the streets of Rhun – the Dakani's panic and the rapidly spreading flames.

Volkov 2 stood on the bridge, his slender, Ullan silhouette clad in a human admiral's uniform. It was the first fire on the surface he had seen since their arrival. He watched as the fire instantly consumed the primitive, wooden structure. Their wood is more flammable than Earth's, he thought. Or perhaps it's just the effect of the jump in oxygen content? Everything that had barely smoldered here for millennia had now become tinder.

He watched as the guardsman calmly extinguished the fire with foam from the red container and then calmed the natives. The Guard's mission was to protect, but their very presence was fundamentally changing this world. This thought raised serious concerns in his mind about the biosphere. He turned to the science officer, who was monitoring planetary readings.

""Will the modified amoebas we released into the oceans not threaten their biosphere and life? We are accelerating this planet's evolution in a way we cannot fully control.""

The science officer, a young woman with a focused expression, immediately displayed the data on her terminal.

""Vice Admiral, the simulations indicate that none of the planet's major ecosystems will suffer. The amoebas are designed to process carbon dioxide and release oxygen, but their population is self-regulating and will die off once it reaches our target threshold. There will be fires, that is inevitable, until the Dakani learn respect for open flame. There will also be natural fires from electrical discharges, lightning. Fortunately, 80% of the planet is covered in forest. The natives only used wood as a building material, not for fuel as we once did. Their world has a vast ecosystem of trees; a few hundred natural fires will not deplete that supply.""

Volkov 2 nodded. Logical. But the risk still existed.

""However, I recommend,"" the officer added, ""that we maintain and limit the increase of the oxygen level in the atmosphere to 15%. This is the minimum value needed for us to breathe without a mask, and at the same time, it should not cause a global ecological catastrophe. A further increase would be too risky, especially since their wood is highly flammable compared to Earth's.""

""Understood. Maintain 15%. So be it,"" Volkov 2 ordered. He looked back at the screen, where the calmed Dakani were touching the charred but saved wall with awe. They were like children who had been given the most dangerous toy in the universe.

Ken: And I always use my favorite glass cup, which I polish with cream cleanser until it sparkles.

Momen: With cream cleanser? On glass? Won't that scratch it to hell?

Ken: You can't see the scratches with the naked eye, so it's fine! ...Probably!

Momen: Dude, what if it just shatters in your hand one day?

Ken: Actually, I was worried about that, too. So, I took the high-precision digital scale I bought for my espresso, and I weighed the cup. Every. Single. Day. Down to the gram.

Momen: And what happened? Did it keep getting lighter and lighter?

Ken: After polishing it hundreds of times! The result of sanding it down with cream cleanser was...!

Momen: Was...?!

Ken: It hadn't lost a single gram.

Momen: Really? Wow. It’s surprisingly hard to shave 1 gram off a piece of glass.

Sorry about the writing, I’m pretty tired and only just thought to post about this. My sources for this are past reading I have done and then Wikipedia right now, because of the subject matter I don’t want to go digging again into those accounts.

I’m only a couple hours into The Outer Worlds, no spoilers, but I keep feeling like “The Protectorate” is just a grossly written and weird faction. I’ve gotten to the Vox building part, and I have seen the words “mental refreshment” like a thousand times. 

For people who have not played, this is the first faction you encounter as you raid them to steal technology, and are told this is a practice they engage in and see it referred to constantly. It’s almost immediately made clear that it’s a lobotomy, you’re actually told about it by that word before the euphemism. So it’s not any form of twist in the story. It’s something that the first faction, the Protectorate, you encounter engages in. The Protectorate is a monarchy led by the family line of a tech/industrial founder who created the main method of space travel. She made her own colony and now her grandchild runs it. They vaguely talk about her idea for a utopia, which sounds like it’s general BS but after a while you realize that in the lore of the game, this is meant to be a collectivist faction. They constantly talk about how they’re not like “the corporatists” and they oppose “unfettered capitalism” and “consumerism.” They’re highly advanced and their people usually want for nothing and have no personal initiative and while there is a class structure it’s more about “everything being in its place.” They explicitly say their economy is planned, and don’t even fixate on the plan being the brainchild of their specific technocratic dictator but a plan by the people at the top of the hierarchy in general (and the corporate faction has defectors who talk about how much more free they are choosing their job). Clearly it is meant to be technocratic, it’s led by the children of a tech mogul and its obsessed with technology, but it still is explicitly set apart from the capitalist factions and hammers in over and over how they’re anti corporate.

Most of those details are, it can feel like a criticism of collectivism that isn’t really representative of any real collectivist (communist, socialist, indigenous, some religious orders, and I don’t think fascists are collectivist but libertarians do so even those) societies from history, they talk too much about serving their fellow man to be normal fascists and don’t ever talk about race or eugenics, etc. 

What they do seem obsessed with is just “mental refreshment.” In what really must be a reference to the great purges and early World War Two Soviet Union, in almost every log entry they constantly talk about it: if someone failed then their superiors recommend mental refreshment, people talk about how they’re afraid of it happening, brainwashed people try and square not wanting to do it with how it’s officially a good thing to do, ads run on loudspeakers for centers that perform it, you run into a few people who are in really rough shape because it happened to them, and sometimes it’s just constant. I have read multiple things in the game that are just hammering in the idea that any disloyalty, any mistakes, anything at all results in it happening to people. Sometimes it’s clearly echoing World War Two, with someone saying “they think the only reason I lost this battle or let the enemy overwhelm us was because I had some disloyalty to the plan.” Other times it talks about rigid work discipline and someone not following the plan getting arrested purely to have this done to them (I’m not even sure they have prisons, they don’t mention them).

So basically it just throws the idea of lobotomies at you endlessly. And while doesn’t necessarily make them seem like they’re not that bad, the references to it from people who are really familiar or oppose it are very bleak and treat it seriously, I have two key issues. The first is that it feels kind of bizarre and gross to make it not just a harrowing ultimate threat that happens to just a few, like in Half Life 2, but something just vomitted into your face constantly, and second this just isn’t how lobotomies worked in real life.

The first is kind of already established, although I was surprised the faction was as big as it was considering they dialed them up to 110% evil right away. To be honest, the mention of lobotomies as a frequent thing made this faction irredeemable right off the bat and removed any kind of ambiguity there might be. To the point that I’m sure as the game opens up they won’t be a major part of the game’s story (no spoilers). The missions are mostly about fighting them too, like it’s the enclave from fallout 3. It’s just a huge contrast from the outer worlds one where the most “collectivist” thing they really talk about is their still individualistic religion, and then the cartoony rebel group. I keep hearing about the amazing writing and realistic political factions and it clearly lays beyond what I’m playing.

More important though is the weird invocation of lobotomies in this game’s setting. For anyone who isn’t aware, lobotomies are a form of brain surgical procedure where parts of the brain in the frontal lobe are mutilated for no actual medical reason other than changing the behavior of the patient. Again, there is no medical reason and it is destructive to the extreme, causing at best severe problems with people’s bodies from losing control of many functions and having seizures and at worst causing problems that I don’t think I’m even allowed to go into. While some aspects of past health procedures are played up in media, lobotomies are exactly as bad or worse than how they were depicted. They were invented in the early 20th century as a “cure” to severe mental conditions or mental health problems but became most popular after World War Two, most famously in the US where it was performed 40,000 times and is only banned by name in some states, after it was invented in Europe where it ultimately was performed 17,000 times. The Soviets adopted it after it became popular in the US but then banned them in 1950, labeling them inhuman and immoral. Something that is important to understand is that lobotomy was typically used as an individualistic punishment. People who did not meet social expectations, especially women, were punished for them if they simply wouldn’t behave how those around them wanted to. It “fixed” people who were broken is a purely behavioral way and the standards for that judgement were often very low. The most frequent reason to use it was that it made people who were institutionalized “easier to care for,” which in the overcrowded asylum systems of the day, is exactly as dark and dangerous as it sounds. It also heavily affected people who were expected to be silent or stay in line rather than embarrass their wealthy families. Famously the Kennedy’s had it done on JFK’s sister, and to the women who wrote about it comes as one of the darkest periods in western gender oppression since the witch burnings, although smaller in scale. (100,000 women burned in Germany alone, 57,000 recorded lobotomies in the west with a bias towards being performed on women). It also was sold as a way to make people more productive. Here’s an account by a leading doctor who performed the practice:

(STRONG CONTENT WARNING) “[The] personality of the patient was changed in some way in the hope of rendering him more amenable to the social pressures under which he is supposed to exist."" He described one 29-year-old woman as being, following lobotomy, a ""smiling, lazy and satisfactory patient with the personality of an oyster"" who could not remember Freeman's name and endlessly poured coffee from an empty pot. When her parents had difficulty dealing with her behavior, Freeman advised a system of rewards (ice cream) and punishment (smacks).”

This doctor pushed the practice so hard in the US that he once performed it on multiple people at once, causing severe accidents and even worse damage to some of them. It was truly a monstrous time based on some of the most extreme sexism and hatred for people with mental health disorders or differences. Incidentally; the Nobel foundation refuses to rescind the prize awarded to the men who invented lobotomies and defends the practice in retrospect on its website.

It should be noted that both Soviet doctors and the western father of “cybernetics” criticized it heavily as something that was clearly against basic human decency, and at least according to Wikipedia it was never widespread in its deployment (ending in 1950 stopped it from ever spreading to the eastern bloc in general). The point was in many ways to bolster ideas of individuality and freedom, because it wasn’t performed by the state in a lot of instances, it was falsely seen as medical, and it was meant to uphold systems of oppression against women, the disabled, and people with different mental health who were seen as abnormal.

So why is it the defining characteristic of the game’s collectivist faction! There are lots of criticisms a game can make about collectivism if they really want to, I can follow the logic even if I disagree with them. Treating the 1932 famine as an eternal thing? Fine. Treating the gulag system as always being a thing and always being like it was from 1932 to 1946? Fine. Saying people were always sent to Siberia for failing badly at work or for speaking the language of a perceived enemy? Again, I can follow the logic and the extrapolation. But taking what might be the defining worst form of capitalist punishment as it actually existed and removing all of its actual characteristics to make it a kind of torture porn punchline for why collectivism is bad? No that makes no sense at all. The only other precedent in media I can see for this is that bewildering part of Superman Red Son where a rich, prosperous, and free (although Superman controls all of politics) communist society has brain control chips for some unexplained reason. Again, lobotomies were not a significant thing even with the Nazis, so even if the creators are libertarians who think Nazis and communists are the same it doesn’t work. Like there honestly is a straight line between the fake medical perceptions of women and minorities as “*nsane” for resisting their position in disruptive ways to lobotomies, but there is basically no line between the great purges/the arrests of “wreckers” and the practice of lobotomies. This is like a AAA RPG game lauded on its in deep politics making a faction that is matriarchal, and then making it super racist because matriarchy societies are usually focused on child birth and rearing and social ties from the mother’s bloodline; imagining “social ties from blood” sounds like ethnic bigotry if you squint at it. It’s just embarrassingly bad politics and spits on the actual history of the victims who suffered unspeakable harms from this practice.",20,1762093133.0,SocialistGaming,8,0.82,False

1omifit,https://www.reddit.com/r/nanowrimo/comments/1omifit/pep_talk_november_2nd/,Pep Talk November 2nd,"Dear Fellow Writer,

Delivering a novel in a month must be the most extreme challenge in writing.

I can’t claim to have done it in a month, but I once drafted a novel in six weeks. That draft eventually became my first published book, *Incendiary*. There are three things you need to know about that. One, that the first draft was unpublishable. Two, that the obsession and the sleep deprivation drove me to a place of dubious mental stability which, in retrospect, we can all laugh about. And three, that I am more proud of those six weeks than of any other period in my life. It changed me. I was working in an attic room in Paris, living on coffee and nerves. I say “living” – in truth I was mutating. I crossed a Rubicon that they will have to drag my cold dead body back across.

That’s what you’re doing, if you’re doing NaNoWriMo. You could have chosen to write a short story this month. You could have redecorated. You could have lounged on your couch and absorbed reality TV, formulating opinions about which of the nice young people ought to be your nation’s brand new idol. Instead you have crossed a line of no return. You have chosen to engage – and in many cases reengage – with a dangerous process that changes you.

We live in an age when the war for hearts and minds is considered just as vital as the war for territory on the battlefield. In a world where ideas hold so much power, a writer is on civilization’s front line. To become a writer, therefore, is a serious business. It requires a commitment to move from passively absorbing your cultural tradition to informing it. That’s a significant transformation, and like all major works it won’t happen overnight. In your case, you’ve scheduled it for the month of November.

The good news is, if you’re committed, a month is enough time. Unless you have more natural talent than I do, then it’s not necessarily enough time to produce a perfected novel. But if you write out of your skin every day then it is enough time to learn your own mental geography and to make the jump to a new way of writing.

It doesn’t matter what genre you write in. All literature is transformative. To make people laugh; to tell a light-hearted romantic story; to let intelligent readers forget their troubles for an hour in the absence of the politicians and the money men who make our lives hell – these are some of the hardest feats to accomplish as a writer, and some of the most serious political acts you can perform. You don’t have to be a Serious Writer to be a serious writer. I once read a beautiful paragraph about teenage vampires – teenage vampires, for goodness’ sake – that moved me more than all of Hemingway. You don’t need to be trying to change the world in order to change someone’s world. What you need is to be seriously committed to your work.

That commitment comes from you and it isn’t my business to tell you what form it should take. I just wanted to use this opportunity to let you know how much I respect you for what you are doing, to wish you well, and to offer some practical suggestions from my experience.

To this end I asked my followers on Twitter if they were doing NaNoWriMo this year and, if so, whether they had any practical questions or concerns that they would like me to address in this pep talk. I got a lot of questions and found that they fell into three main categories, of which the following are representative:



u/LizUK asked: How much do you think planning / structuring your #NaNoWriMo project counts towards completing it?



Not much, I think. A novel is a living thing and it resists containment within the structures we erect for it. Even worse, the novel has intelligence and it will inevitably turn against its creator. Think of it like the velociraptors in Jurassic Park. The problem is that a good character in a novel will reach a point of maturity where he or she is not necessarily biddable.

For example, I might plan that in Chapter 6, Samantha will succumb to the advances of the amorous Dave, thus neatly setting up Chapter 7, in which they build a delightful house together, in Minnesota, in the Prairie style. But it might turn out, once I get into the detail of the dialogue of Ch 6, that Dave turns out to be something of a pompous ass and that Samantha decides she’d rather be with Dave’s funnier younger brother Pete (even though she still can’t decide whether he’s strikingly handsome or slightly weird-looking).

So now I have a choice as a writer. Either I can make Chapter 6 conform to my original plan by forcing Samantha to be with Dave, somewhat against her will, or I can let Chapter 6 be what it needs to be – probably feeling more alive and real than it did in my original structure – and I can change my mind about what happens in Chapter 7. Maybe Samantha builds the house with Pete, and Dave comes and bangs against the windows on a cold, snowy night. Maybe they ignore him, and forget about it all through the drunken, passionate winter, only to find his perfectly-preserved body down by the brook, when the spring thaw comes and the first crocuses are breaking surface, on the morning when Samantha is starting to think that maybe she doesn’t want to be with Pete after all.

My point is that the job of a novelist is to explore human emotion and motivation. You learn more about your protagonists as you write them. If you are not very often forced by your characters to bin your masterplan, then you are a wooden and a formulaic writer indeed. So, better than having a planned structure is to begin with a character or two, and a theme you intend to explore, and an initial direction you plan to start exploring in. Don’t be alarmed when, on arriving at what you thought was your summit, you realise you’ve climbed up the wrong mountain. That’s why novelists go through drafts – because plans go brilliantly awry.



u/vpeanuts asked: *How do you remain motivated? #NaNoWriMo*



The answer to this question is always changing for me. When I started writing as a child I just loved the work of making good sentences and paragraphs – of playing with language. Later I was motivated by provoking strong reactions in the people I showed my work to. Then there was a bad time of several years when I was motivated by a desire for a certain kind of glory or glamour, without thinking too hard about what that meant. I think you need to get through that stage pretty quickly.

After my first novel was published I was motivated to bring injustices to light with my work, and to help people concussed by bad TV to find real life interesting again. That had a kind of grandiosity to it, though, and I found that my writing improved when I learned a little bit more humility. Then, after my second novel did well, I was motivated for a long time by fear – the fear of not being able to do it again. What cured me of that was rediscovering my very first motivation – the love of working with language and character.

I’d say that is what motivates me now. I simply enjoy sitting down in front of my screen and exploring my characters. I like the mental work of solving the problems of plot and structure. I like exercising my freedom to write as I please, for readers who have the freedom to read as they please. I like not needing anyone’s permission. I try to remember how lucky we all are to live like this. I see it as a temporary state of grace and I find that very motivating.



u/myplatypus asked: What to do when you want to abandon it and start again? How to keep going when you think you’ve just written a page of rubbish?



Something I’ve learned is that it’s very hard to tell, at the end of your writing day, whether you’ve done great work or bad work. The quality of the writing is hard to judge until you’ve had some sleep and got some perspective on it. Often sheer euphoria at your own brilliance will keep you writing late into the night, and you can hardly sleep because what you’ve written is so damned good. Then you wake up the next day and read it, and you realise it’s a pile of self-indulgent crap. This happens to me two days out of five. Then you get the opposite case, where you beat yourself up because the ideas are coming so slowly and all your dialogue seems timid and pedestrian. A week later you might look back on that day as a pretty solid performance, where your characters were honest with each other and maybe even created a couple of touching moments.

The more I learn about the writing process, the more I suspect that there is no such thing as a bad day at the keyboard. Sometimes you need slow days where you work through a dozen ideas that aren’t destined to fly. It creates a kind of intensity that eventually goads your brain into giving you a good day. Or sometimes, if you keep having slow days, then perhaps the novel really is asking you a deeper question about whether your plot, or your characterisation, or your theory about the human heart really is up to scratch. Experience is knowing when you’re having a slow day, versus when you’re having a slow novel.

The good days are when you perform; the slow days are when you learn to perform better. The only bad days as a writer are the ones when you are too cowardly or too lazy to sit down at the keyboard and give it everything you have.

If you can sit down at the keyboard every day in November and give it everything you have, then there is no writer on earth who is better than you. I hope that it will be an exciting, frightening, weird, joyful, unpredictable, transformative month for you, and I hope that you will produce fantastic work that you are proud of.

With all good wishes,

Chris Cleave
