Hello there fine people!

I usually manage to handle my stuff pretty well, but lately, it‚Äôs been hitting a little harder than usual. I‚Äôve been feeling pretty lonely, to be honest.

It‚Äôs like every time I try to reach out or make plans, I end up scrolling through my contacts list and just not finding anyone (which kinda sucks).

So, I figured I‚Äôd put myself out there and see what happens!

A bit about me: I‚Äôm 25, I love writing code, cooking, taking photos, and brewing coffee. I‚Äôm also big into lifting weights and hiking (though Ive been slacking off lately).

Ku≈õtoz
he was born May 4, 2006 as a Cox≈æian title is the first of its kind and Ku≈õtoz is also titled as one of the first Cox≈æians ever as he was born, his great grandma died in Gda≈Ñsk, poland, he right now is 19 years old, which is one of if not the oldest in the three Cox≈æians and without further ado here are they actually fun parts

Ku≈õtoz is a type of guy who would do crazy stuff like throw tables of buildings just like radium and also at the age of seven he became a massive coaster enthusiast riding coasters up to 200‚Äì300 feet because of how tall he is making him pretty tall for seven-year-old and then the next fun fact there was one time when he had a very small record collection, he now has over 100 records he now is called a dedicated record collector. He is also at least very addicted to Gatorade. He just really loves it.


Radium
he was born June 20, 2008 making him 17 years old. He is the type to do very crazy stuff like go drunk ghost hunting as well as throw freaking tables off buildings which he actually has done once or twice. He makes music that gets very famous overtime and if you tell him, his music is not getting good just wait a couple months. It‚Äôll get 10 million views by then he also makes Hardstyle music. and also has a record collection but not too big just a little small. He‚Äôs also very violent sometimes after his brother died.(he didn‚Äôt really care about him much though) he also has a condition which makes him very angry almost every time he‚Äôs never my angry, never normally angry. He will take your house and blow it to the ground if you anger him.

 And also like. Ku≈õtoz he has a massive coaster addiction. The tallest coaster is written being millennium force at Cedar point over 300+ feet making it a pretty good addition to his roller coaster list which yes he does have a list of favorite roller coasters.


Trevor
Trevor is basically a maniac even to radium which radium has done a lot of of unspeakable things.  he works at a coffee shop with ku≈õtoz and sometimes he gets really tired of him and thinks about pouring coffee all over his head while it is still hot(he‚Äôs actually done that one time) so he is very much a maniac

he is very scared of roller coasters, which makes him the only one who doesn‚Äôt like roller coasters out of all the three Cox≈æians which makes some kind of a weirdo so I guess the only way for the others to get him to stop being a maniac is if they force him to ride a roller coaster lol he might like it though

1ibraqa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Chainsawfolk/comments/1ibraqa/my_personal_take_on_the_final_battle_with_the/,My personal take on the final battle with the Death Devil,"Hi everyone, in this post, I‚Äôd like to share my thoughts on how the fight with the death devil might play out. First tho, I‚Äôd like to apologize for any mistakes in my English.

As we know, the Aging Devil arc has more or less wrapped up. Denji, Asa, Yoshida, and the man trapped in the Aging Devil‚Äôs world for over 80 years have escaped after making a deal with the aging devil. Now, our protagonists find themselves at a coffee shop alongside Fami and Fumiko (seriously, why couldn‚Äôt she just stay dead?). What happens next could involve a negotiation about how to deal with the Death Devil(this idea isn‚Äôt mine, I saw it on Twitter, but it seems like the most plausible explanation for why they‚Äôre all gathered)

Now, the situation with the Death Devil isn‚Äôt looking good. The prophecy is only five to six months away, and our protagonists haven‚Äôt defeated a single Primal Devil since the story began. This is a major problem. According to the prophecy, Death will arrive in July 1999, and it will lead a crusade to eradicate humanity, with the help of all the other Primal Devils. So far, the main cast has faced three Primals. On two occasions, they had to flee because they were utterly outmatched, and on the third encounter, with the Aging Devil, has only ended in their favor because they trapped it into its own world. In short, things are not looking great for our protagonists.
So, how could they possibly defeat Death and the Primals? I‚Äôve come up with two possible scenarios so far:

Scenario 1: Stop the Prophecy
The best-case scenario is for Fujimoto to introduce a way to prevent the prophecy from happening altogether. Honestly, by the way things look, the main cast stands a 0% chance of winning in a direct confrontation with Death and the Primals. Nayuta has already clarified that Death is the strongest devil to exist, and as a Primal Devil, it can‚Äôt even be killed. The only way they could win is through an unprecedented level of plot armor, which would likely ruin the fight. A more satisfying solution would be for the cast to discover new information about Nostradamus‚Äôs prophecy, something that allows them to stop it from coming true.

Scenario 2: The ‚ÄúDevil‚Äù Devil
The second scenario is much darker. A while back, in an interview, Fujimoto mentioned the idea of a ‚ÄúDevil Devil‚Äù, a devil embodying humanity‚Äôs fear of devils themselves. This devil could play a crucial role in stopping Death. One heartbreaking possibility is that Pochita sacrifices himself, devouring the ‚ÄúDevil Devil‚Äù to erase all devils, including the Death Devil.
This outcome is still speculative since we don‚Äôt fully understand how Pochita‚Äôs erasure ability works. However, if the prophecy unfolds and they fail to find a way to defeat Death, erasing all devils might be the only option. Erasing the Death Devil itself would be catastrophic. Death is a fundamental concept of life, and removing it could lead overpopulation, resource wars, and humanity‚Äôs eventual destruction.
Erasing the ‚ÄúDevil"" Devil, on the other hand, might have a better outcome. While this would erase all devils, it wouldn‚Äôt erase the concepts they embody. For example, while the Death Devil would vanish, the concept of death would remain intact, preserving the natural order of life and death.


I hope my theory makes sense, and thank you for reading this far! If you have your own ideas or thoughts as to how the final battle will play out please share them in the comments, I'd love to hear them. Thanks again, and have an amazing day!

It‚Äôs connected to a 20A breaker that also powers the kitchen backsplash outlets.

About 1-2 months ago, I started noticing that the breaker would trip if I ran my air fryer while opening the refrigerator door. This was not an issue before, and I‚Äôve been using the same air fryer for over a year. Other appliances on the circuit include a vacuum sealer, coffee maker, and electric kettle.

To troubleshoot, I tested running only the air fryer while opening the refrigerator door, and it consistently tripped the breaker. I also unplugged everything else on the circuit, leaving only the refrigerator and air fryer, but the same issue occurred.

Recently, the problem has worsened: sometimes, just opening the refrigerator door trips the breaker, even when no other appliances are running. This happens inconsistently, about once every few days.

I thought the air fryer might be the problem, so I purchased a new one with the same power draw. Initially, it seemed fine‚ÄîI tested the new air fryer at max power while opening the refrigerator door, and the breaker didn‚Äôt trip. However, a few hours later, when no appliances were in use, simply opening the refrigerator door caused the breaker to trip again.

I‚Äôm unsure what‚Äôs causing this issue or how to further narrow it down. Should I call an electrician or an appliance repair service to investigate, or is there something else I should try first?",3,1738031215.0,HomeImprovement,1,1.0,False

1ibr831,https://www.reddit.com/r/VillainyGroup/comments/1ibr831/the_rogues_gallery_1855/,The Rogues' Gallery (1855),">Keeping track of your villains is definitely a problem... and it was the development of photography which helped to make the task more manageable back in the 1800s.

[Rogue's Gallery](https://preview.redd.it/6da5waluanfe1.png?width=1312&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c5fc168b94735d53778e131ca69e46028d6edec)

It's safe to say that photography wasn't a new art back in 1855... but it was still very-much in its infancy... as was crime science and what we would today consider to be 'Policing'.

The conjunction of the two, however, where photography was used as a means of advancing police work, became a thing when Allan Pinkerton, the founder of the Pinkerton National Detective Agency put together something he called The Rogues' Gallery.

No longer needing to rely on the often vague description of an offender, victims could now look at the Rogues' Gallery to find an actual photograph of the person who had offended against them.

No more awkward sketch artist attempts to draw someone from poorly-remembered descriptions, followed by hundreds of Police officers trying to figure out whether the awkward smudge was a birthmark, or whether someone had spilled some coffee.

This seems pretty straight-forward now... we're always seeing on TV and movies how the stern detective type will get the weeping victim to thumb through a catalog of offender photos... and then going ""Ah, yes. Dirty Dave McTavish of Lindisfarne..."" (or similar) and making an arrest.

Back then, however, it was ground-breaking stuff.

Furthermore, this Gallery set about linking offenders to one another by association, describing their modus operandi, their hideouts and hangouts... and basically becoming a very early form of crime database.

The term Rogues' Gallery has now come to mean any collection of pictures of people who have been arrested as criminals... or a pictorial collection of any kind of 'rogue'... such as famous dictators, or deadly viruses... or a collection of hundreds of pre-generated characters for use in Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, back in 1980.

As you can imagine, after a few years, any collection of photographs of thousands upon thousands of villains was going to become cumbersome and difficult to curate.

A chap by the name of Alphonse Bertillon (1853-1914) standardised the practice of photography for crime-fighting purposes in the 1870s... creating a 'judicial style' of photography to help manage the problem of information overload.

You'd recognise this 'judicial style' as what we would today consider a 'mugshot'... systematically filed and cross-indexed so they could be easily retrieved.

Bertillon was also into measuring just about everything... so along-side the photographs of villains, you'd also have the lengths of their fingers, the circumference of their foreheads, and so forth. A practice known as Bertillonage... which gradually became adopted around the world until Fingerprints eventually became the new gold standard.

>So, while the Rogues' Gallery was an important tool in early law enforcement, it had its issues, and certainly underwent a great deal of technical advancement. What it has left us with, however, is an intriguing look at the early steps of trying to apply scientific principles to finicky real-world problems.",1,1738031138.0,VillainyGroup,0,1.0,False

Trying to change ways like the seasons leaves sway. An excuse to seek a warmer melody. The circular motifs have me dizzy, a little exhausted from a lack of coffee, and the constant noise I seek for distraction has given me this want for a softer silence. A faint drip of water and the hum of electronics, the odd settling of the house... and the clicking of keys, is all I hear now.

  
Until I'm drawn inward and then

I almost want to ignore what's heard - I turned the noise back on without realizing it. A series of habits, almost just that. Repeat with difference, mutate casually. Trying to be better, in the right ways. I almost want to ignore the fear entirely - to soar through this eternity without a moments doubt, or a single thought after this very second.

  
The contradiction have given me a bit a headache, solving the problem with the question generator, and finding the energy to do everything at once - sometimes anything at all - but somehow finding it. Somehow, feeling like I'm solving it. As if frustration and hopeless has only become parts of the chain, a few simple steps, of a process which repeats similarly.

  
Ignoring it again, yeah, the problem. Wanting the best life but neglecting everything that leads to that moment, the absolute basics forgotten about, trying to come up with a hair-brained scheme to resolve some justified wrong. Some unjustified wrong. Something wrong, and I almost want to ignore what's heard. I would rather coexist than be at war. I tried leaving, that didn't work.

Whether that's biking, reading, or catching up on a backlog of TV shows that I've put off. Today I got an email from cashapp about my yearly statement, and opening it up and looking through all the previous sends, it made me feel warm and press my thighs together, reading over the activity from when I was with my last domme. I'd send for her coffee in the morning, pay for her Netflix and Spotify, and some weekends I'd pay for her and her husband's dinner out. There were nights I got home from work and we'd talk on the phone and she'd have me edge for her while we talked about our days. Paying her to be allowed to come was some of the most intense orgasms I've ever had.

And reading over the statement and the previous activity, I found myself slowly beginning to stroke myself and thinking about how happy it made her to send. It made me this close ""|\_\_|"" to posting again and hoping to find a domme to talk and send to. My mind started racing about how I could make someone's Valentines Day special.

This is mostly just a warning I guess, to always be vigilant, because you never know where something my trigger that feeling, that impulse, and then your body is shaking with yearning to send.",2,1738030956.0,paypigsupportgroup,0,1.0,False

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. Right now I've been playing around with some watercolors. I have big ambitions to have my own graphic design gig some day, but right now I don't currently work.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, and my iPad. So, like, pretty much everything but PC üòÖ I'm a achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everthing, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pok√©mon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. Never really gotten the chance to play an TTRPG, but would love to. I suffer from a bit of learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf üôÉ

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite.

I love Harry Potter. Pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office. I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills üòÖ But I'm trying new recipes all the time. I'm rather adept at baking though, and I love smoked meats ü§§

We met at an obscure corner of the internet 
Start talking 
Instantly clicked
Turned out we live 12 kms away from each other 
Same age, same hobbies, same literature taste, music taste, both are kinda old
school
Conversation goes on for hours in a random chatbox
We share socials
I ask her if we can go out somewhere next weekend 
She instantly agrees
I take her to a library date, a old coffee shop where she pays(although i insisted several times), I buy her a chocolate, a book, she gives me flowers and some of her books,(now I dunno if it's because of my birthday or not)
I held her hand while crossing the road, (she held it tight too)
We click some pics, go to another cafe, eat some food and have some drinks(NA)
She extends her curfew till 9 30 after talking to her parents.
We meet again a couple times.
We have been regularly chatting, she has told me that she thinks I'm a gentleman and likes the fact that I made sure that I was comfortable throughout the day we met up. 
We are bunking college again to go somewhere together next Thursday,
Here's the thing tho, based on her previous conversations with me I have deducted the fact that she is a type of a girl who loses interest if the guy doesn't take the lead. 
She talks to me in a very caring tone and bullies me too.  (The bullying is mutual)


Also she has given me slight hints but I dunno if they are proper hints

Like, "" next day I will wear heels to match your height"", teasing me about various things(in an endearing way), sending cute reels (mostly involving romantic poetry and pet stuff), patting my head, trying to reach her hands out everytime we cross the road. 

As we haven't really talked about dating, 
But I have fallen for her like an angel without his wings, I never fell for someone this hard before. And I think she knows that.

 But as she is not the type to ask the guy out, should I ask her out formally the next day we meet or should I wait a bit more... And will bringing her flowers all of a sudden be a risky thing to do? (Although I have asked her if she prefers roses or sunflowers more so it won't be that big of a surprise)

I never sleep trained my first born (7m) , we slept together for waaaaaay too long, but it was always just him and I so I never minded. he's squared away, but the baby- I've been significantly more neurotic with him, googling everything he does to make sure it's okay and taking him to several unnecessary doc appts just to hear them tell me he's perfectly fine. at the last one I had a whole meltdown, almost passed out crying and hyperventilating because his sleep has been so hectic we were setting aside 3 hours AT LEAST a night to get him settled and in his bed. I ended up co sleeping w him a lot because I just wanted us to get sleep but it was not good sleep and I am so scared every time we lay together but my exhaustion just got to a point where it would override my fear and we slept together. any ways, the doc said with his weight being good and him being healthy she said we could try the CIO method. I hate this method. it breaks my heart to hear him crying. he did pretty okay for a few days, an hour, and the next day 40, the next 30 then sleeping for a magical 10 hours!! but right now as I type this I'm going on an hour of him crying and I just want to go cuddle him but also I want him to learn to be comfy on his own. I did go down and settle him about 15 minutes ago all the way to long blinks and limp limbs, he was nearly asleep so I laid him back down and as soon as his butt touches his bed he wakes and cries and screams, as always. I don't know if checking on him is worse or if letting him cry is worse, I just don't know. and what even is ""sleep trained""? I've read it just means they can self settle but... when is that supposed to happen? how do I know how long to leave him. please give me your sleeping advice. I'm feeling so guilty and just want him okay and safe in his own bed with at least a shred of my sanity left. üò≠ thank you

edit to add in case it matters: his bedtime routine is lotion, fresh diaper, and a long feed in a dim room, during the day we play a ton: tummy time, baths, books, toys, he has a bit of independent play every once and a while for 5-10 minutes while I make coffee or switch laundry or whatever.. okay thanks",0,1738030773.0,Parenting,3,0.5,False

He made us stay an additional 2 hours just for him to be wrong. For the second experiment, my group finished early and the TA asked to check our papers before leaving. He wanted us to complete one more calculation and provide the graph for it yet he DID NOT ask any other group to do this. My friend and I were so fed up at that point that we just turned in our reports as we felt it was unfair that he did not ask anyone else's group to do this (once again) and we no longer trust his calculations/opinion. That same day one of the girls in my group had a coffee (which ik isn't allowed) and 2 other girls from different groups.

TW: self-exit ideation,"This is not one of those posts where I‚Äôm looking for validation that I‚Äôm not the asshole; I genuinely want to know what other people think because I sometimes find it hard to gauge what is appropriate and what other people and sometimes I am feeling. I can give some of my personal backstory but it would be too long so ask away if you have context questions.  
I‚Äôm 31 and have always preferred solitary activities and loads of space over socialising. This is not a secret to my friends, although I do mask the extent of this and tend to go to more social gatherings and meet-ups than would be ideal for me to maintain friendships. I reckon loads of people can relate and I feel like in order to keep friends you‚Äòve gotta spend time with them lmao

I‚Äôm the kind of person who can meet you, have a great connection and not see you again for literal months and pick up where we left off just fine. I have found a handful of friends who understand and accept this and some that are pretty similar because they‚Äôre either super busy, live far away or are introverted. I should say I moved A LOT growing up, so attachment has never been a huge issue for me. I am aware not everyone is like me, hence the compromise with the socialising. To clarify, I don‚Äôt hate socialising and usually have a good enough time once I‚Äôm there, but I have the ever present underlying feeling of waiting to go home. And the part that I keep more hidden from my friends is that if I socialise I usually need soooo much downtime to recover. To give you an idea, if I go to a friend‚Äôs house I tend to plan and make sure I have the day off the next day to recharge, even if it was just a few hours playing music and drinking coffee. Yup. I‚Äôve spent a week in isolation before after particularly social outings. I‚Äôve tried explaining this to people in the past and they either say ‚Äúsame!‚Äù in a way that tells me they do NOT get it, or they kind of dismiss it saying stuff like I need to socialise more to be healthy, etc. Most of my friends are hopeless extroverts and although I love them, I feel heavily misunderstood in this aspect of my life and can get easily irritated by volume and constant planning to do things, especially if it‚Äôs last minute. Side note, my friends all live near each other and I have to get two trains (which costs a fortune) and usually walk over an hour each way just to see them at our usual meet-up. I also get up at around 8am if I want to see them at 2pm, which is a very long day sometimes getting back at 9pm. This means that if we‚Äôre meeting once a week, it actually takes up a lot of my time and energy. I am willing to do this, but as I don‚Äôt usually feel the exhaustion until it hits me later, it can take its toll.

I also realised recently that I‚Äôve never invited anyone to hang out beyond the vague ‚Äúwe should hang out again‚Äù remark without any specific date because I have learned not to make future plans while in an extroverted state (iykyk).

When it comes to social media, I never saw the point of it beyond admin and work. I absolutely despise getting messages from people randomly that just say ‚Äúhey‚Äù or whatever. I also work in industries that are very social and crowded with people, so my DMs are always full. About 50% is creepy men, but that‚Äôs another thing entirely not for today.  
Recently I began therapy for past childhood and adolescent trauma specifically catered to third culture kids (a.k.a missionary kids). It has brought up a lot and I‚Äôve been especially sensitive to feelings of overwhelm when it comes to onslaught of messages and feeling like everyone just wants to take, take, take from me (I know that‚Äôs not strictly true, I‚Äôm describing how my body reacts in those moments). I developed a strategy of just going on the socials once a day to do a ‚Äúmass answer‚Äú session where I reply to all my messages in one go. This sometimes takes over two hours, listening to voice memos and furiously typing.

It got to the point where I was cursing every time my phone buzzed and felt genuine rage if I finished a 9 part message reply and two minutes later they‚Äôre responding already. Even when I‚Äôm nocturnal, I‚Äôve gotten the three bubbles popping up at 3am. Like, what do people do with their time? I became disappointed with myself when I yelled aloud, ‚Äúget a fucking life‚Äù one time when my phone buzzed a gazillion times in a row. I don‚Äôt want to be that, because it makes me feel inauthentic. I value friendship because of the connection and constant texts just feels like a cheap substitute, especially if it‚Äôs dumb links to stuff which is usually funny but can sometimes be a 6 minute video that makes my heart drop. It can come across as rude if they see I‚Äôm online and don‚Äôt reply. But what I really want to do because I‚Äôm at home and in my own space is do art, write music, journal, read, lift weights, do yoga, all that good stuff. Or just do NOTHING for an hour, you know?

Where I‚Äôm stuck : Because my friend groups (yes, plural) are pretty tight knit and riddled with ADHD lol cutting down significantly on socialising means it would impact our friendship. Some of us meet up to practice music together, so I can‚Äôt just skip out easily. It feels like an all or nothing situation, or like there‚Äôs a quota of times I can give a genuine reason to not go before it‚Äôs unacceptable. I feel awkward saying no so much but they don‚Äôt seem to understand that a night out to a concert, which for them would be just the ticket price and maybe a drink, for me it‚Äôs at least double that because of the travel and even more if I need to stay the night and get the early train home in the morning. My jobs pay sporadically so I feel like I‚Äôm always broke and can‚Äôt really save for what I really love doing - travel (solo, of course üòâ).

I have put my foot down on certain people, like the ones who send ‚Äú?‚Äù as a whole complete message because I didn‚Äôt reply within two minutes. If you do that - STOP, it‚Äôs rude and pushy. Go drink some water and come back in 20 minutes for the love of god you won‚Äôt die üòÇ

Where I might be the asshole: I haven‚Äôt been on my messages app for four days because I‚Äôve been going THROUGH IT. Like, in bed, crying, processing my therapy session, getting flashbacks and not sleeping at night, eating properly, you get the idea. Last night and this morning was particularly bad as I battled with pretty severe suicidal ideation. My friends know I‚Äôve started therapy but I don‚Äôt share the extent of my suffering because that‚Äôs between me and the doc. I can expand more on that but I feel like that‚Äôs enough justification. I have overshared in the past and it‚Äôs made things worse and I‚Äôve even made myself feel violated for sharing things I didn‚Äôt realise I didn‚Äôt want to share until I got home (hence the previous comment of not always being aware of how I feel until it hits my body). I think it‚Äôs called dyspraxia or something and it sucks. I hadn‚Äôt been counting the days I‚Äôd not been on socials but it did cross my mind to send a broadcast to everyone to say that I was going to take some time off as I‚Äôve done in the past but I had no energy as I‚Äôd have to deselect all my work contacts and the last time I did this, I got an avalanche of messages asking me what is wrong and a few men offering their ‚Äúsupport‚Äù and giving me their own trauma stories I never asked for to connect or whatever. To clarify, I don‚Äôt know these men, they are people I MAYBE had a passing conversation with, IF that. One guy said he enjoyed talking to me on set and when I asked what we talked about he recalled a conversation I had WITH SOMEONE ELSE. He had been standing there listening. Sorry, tangent. Back to my potential assholery:

One of my closer friends in the group messaged me this morning (she had sent me a couple of messages over the last couple of days already including a link) and I heard the buzz because I‚Äôd set my phone on loud for calls and I‚Äôm not tech savvy or motivated to learn how to isolate sound for just calls. When I opened the message she was asking me ‚Äúam I missing something‚Äù and began telling me she was feeling ignored and hurt that I hadn‚Äôt replied since Thursday and it really got to me because she was doubting herself like if she did something wrong and even got into a thought that I was ghosting her because she thought I might‚Äôve interpreted a silly song she sang as her hitting on me (I‚Äôm queer). This friend sometimes has bouts of self-doubt and we all overthink but it really hurt me that she had these feelings. If a friend doesn‚Äôt reply for a while, I usually send something like, ‚Äúhey, just checking in, thumbs up you‚Äôre alive!‚Äù Simple, it works.  
This friend knew about my therapy, the fact I‚Äôve had three bouts of sickness over the winter and that I‚Äòm planning on moving in temporarily with my very pregnant sister to help out, so it‚Äôs been hectic. I am also in overdraft and can‚Äôt even buy a bus ticket right now and I‚Äôm living off beans and rice. This is why I was a bit surprised and upset that her mind went down that slippery slope of rejection. I was also hurt she thought I‚Äôd ghost her if she hit on me.  
I went against my rule of over sharing and just told her how tough it‚Äôs been, which by her response I don‚Äôt think she grasped the severity because she basically said she often feels the same and promptly told me she was meeting up with a mutual friend for coffee (invitation for me to join) but I‚Äôm happy enough to let that go. I know that if she‚Äôd seen my tear streaked face and my unwashed body, hair and pigsty of an apartment she‚Äòd not have dreamed to ask me to come out. Because of that message and because I was already on the phone, I went ahead and did a broadcast message to most of my contacts to say that I was taking time away from social media. Cue the message pile on, the overwhelm and undoing of the effects of my journaling this morning. Ever had that feeling of, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to end this out of spite, that‚Äôll show them‚Äù? That intrusive thought simultaneously horrified me and made me numb.

I may sound like a weak wuss and I fully accept that. I have no stamina when I‚Äôm in a fight or flight or freeze or fawn state. She sent me a message saying she‚Äôd grant me a week, which I clicked a heart emoji without thinking. When I set the phone down I thought about it and suddenly got very angry at that. My past has made me feel like I don‚Äôt have autonomy and because I have a very chill demeanour, I suspect people think they have a right to dictate my time. I wish I could film myself and see if I really come across as some pushover. I recognise this may be me conflating and blowing the situation out of proportion (that‚Äôs the crux of why I‚Äôm posting this) but I felt offended and like I was being given an allowance on personal space. Like what, she will message me in a week and I MUST reply even if I‚Äôm not ready?

She is in no way clingy - she is simply energy reincarnate even when she‚Äôs tired. I think a lot of my personality goes over her head but again, I don‚Äôt mind that I‚Äôm misunderstood as long as I‚Äôm respected. In these moments I feel like giving up on having friends altogether because they are time and energy consuming and goddamn expensive to have. When I travel, I always end up hanging out with a local or other travellers and we have a good time, then we go home to our consecutive countries. I love that and I feel no ill-will to never seeing these brief encounters again and I wonder if I can just do that instead. I can‚Äôt, because I get booked on a lot of jobs my friends get too so it would be awkward to drop everything just to be placed next to them in a scene at work for 12 hours.

I think we‚Äôre good now but I don‚Äôt want this to happen again and I‚Äôm willing to adjust my behaviour but not so much that I‚Äôm putting my mental health at risk. I will always choose me. I mean, if I don‚Äôt, they can‚Äôt have me either, right?

So what I want to know is if I‚Äôm the asshole for not pre-warning people I‚Äôd be going AWOL for a few days (not that I planned it, but I didn‚Äôt consider anyone else in my state). Is it wrong to have relationships in order to live when everyone else seems to live for relationships? 

TLDR; went AWOL on socials due to severe depressive thoughts, friend got hurt I hadn‚Äôt replied for four days.

1ibquzv,https://www.reddit.com/r/woodworking/comments/1ibquzv/large_table_6x6/,Large table - 6'x6',"Hey all.

I recently created a table, this measured approx. 72""x72"" - 1-1/2"" thick approx. hard maple

Epoxy inlay of a station crest.

Along two joint lines, I inlayed black walnut.

  
For support - Initially - 1 6"" wide 3/8"" thick plate, inlayed with threaded inserts  
2x C-channel on the outer ends to support, inlayed, with inserts.

  
\-----

The problem

1) As the wood shrunk, I did NOT leave enough room (initially 1/4"" each way) and it ended up splitting the table on one side, and the other side pushed so hard that it cracked the one piece of hard maple.

2) the C channel fell out, cracked the wood where the inserts were.

3) I put in 2 more plates, 6"" 3/8 thick to support the table, I lag bolted them.

  
\----

  
Solution(s)

I am looking to see if a table of this size is feasible. I want to re-create the table, but this time by inlaying the steel, allowing more expansion and contraction room but also I on the two other sides of the steel plate, I wanted to weld a 2x2 tube on each side to help keep the table flat, since the table right now and when it was sitting at the hall had a slight cup as the seasons went on.

So, with all this being said

  
If I made the changes with the steel plates, welded on the tubes to keep it flat, but also cut in a longer channel for the steel plates to slide, and allowed more room in the wood (3/8 - 1/2"" each side)

walkable to a town for coffee, authentic food, history.

Not touristy. Would much rather be off the beaten path than in a touristy area.

Would like to be as close to the beach as possible for afternoons to relax.

We will rent a car so plan to explore the island by trying to find a home base where we can spend most of our time to avoid being in a car with a toddler.

1ibqtja,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ibqtja,What to put on my walls?,"


So I moved into my place a few months ago. I obviously plan on getting a black and white or just plain black area rug, and a black coffee table for by the couch. I however have no idea how to decorate my walls in my kitchen/living room area. These photos are all one big room, and there‚Äôs 4 pretty empty walls that may or may not need decor. I have no idea what to put on these walls, or which walls to put stuff on. I need very specific ideas as I overthink! My place has kinda a bachelor(ette) pad vibe going for it which I really enjoy and would like to keep up. I also enjoy a more minimalistic look, so nothing crazy! I‚Äôm in my early to mid 20‚Äôs and host get togethers with others my age almost every weekend- so keeping that in mind with decor. If pics of the way the rest of the house is set up would help private message me and I‚Äôll send some but my house is pretty much all white and black themed minus the pink LED‚Äôs. 

Here are some requirements:
-Must be pretty minimalistic
-Must be either black, white, or both

If you have any ideas for other decor that isn‚Äôt wall decor I‚Äôm open to hearing those ideas as well! This is the last room in my house that needs a bit more added to it to feel more homey. I numbered the walls to make it easier.

**CHAPTER 1**

I‚Äôd just pushed the button on the spigot of the boxed wine I‚Äôd opened to go with my Chinese food when the front door of my New York studio burst open.

‚ÄúAbbie? Are you home?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúKitchen,‚Äù I called.¬†

‚ÄúSorry I‚Äôm late!‚Äù Sandy poked her head in first and the rest of her followed, a bag of takeout significantly fuller than mine in tow. Huffing, she blew a few uncooperative strands of long, curly red hair out of her face. ‚ÄúThe subway got stuck and I didn‚Äôt want to walk. It‚Äôs pouring!‚Äù She looked me up and down from my mismatched sweats and old college t-shirt to the top of my wet head. ‚ÄúDid it get you?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúIt did, but I showered.‚Äù I took a deceptively small sip of wine as Sandy locked up and squeezed her bag next to mine. ‚ÄúHow was your day?‚Äù I asked.

Her finely manicured nails glinted under the harsh fluorescents when she waved her hand, and a waft of her perfume ‚Äî the kind that *smelled* as expensive as it was ‚Äî joined the dinner aromas. ‚ÄúLong. We‚Äôre hosting the Boston office next week and everyone has requests. How was yours?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúFine,‚Äù I said. The wound was a little fresh to have its bandage ripped off, but it was now or later. Steeling myself, I added, ‚ÄúI have news!‚Äù in the most upbeat tone I could. Sandy stopped, and her hopeful expression brought pangs of guilt knowing I was about to squash it. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre shutting down production.‚Äù Ugh. Saying it out loud was *so* much worse. I doused the words with a gulp of wine that drained the glass and Sandy stared, jaw hanging.¬†

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know what else to say. It wasn‚Äôt a surprise ‚Äî the cheap sci fi flick had been plagued with problems from pre-production. Delays dominoed down the line, but it was work, and I‚Äôd been on more *interesting* sets to say the least. Everything came to a screeching halt when our director quit so they could find a replacement, but, weirdly, not many people were lining up to break down doors at the chance of directing a movie about killer aliens in the 1800s, with a *Bridgerton* meets *Alien* pitch. Apparently the costs outweighed whatever break-even benefit in the end, and the decision was made.¬†

I was never going to be *proud* of it, but it was a stepping stone, and it had sunk, unwittingly, into Hollywood quicksand.¬†

Sandy‚Äôs face, sharpened from layers of makeup, softened sympathetically. To her credit, she didn‚Äôt lead with the *I told you so* she so easily could have and instead went with, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll figure it out, Abbie. You were too good for that mess, anyway.‚Äù¬†

She made it sound so easy. But Sandy didn‚Äôt need an income ‚Äî her now-retired dentist parents had set her up with great investments, and that was on top of theirs. If the luxury real estate company she worked for folded tomorrow, it would be a choice to work again. It was my starving artist‚Äôs dreams and her loyalty, forged in the fires of a string of unprecedented events that marred our undergrad careers, that kept me living in an apartment that was a full-body stretch of my resources and her in one that was wildly lacking in the amenities she craved. There were some things she couldn‚Äôt understand, and more that I didn‚Äôt want to have to explain ‚Äî like how, after four years of film school and countless grueling jobs, telling¬† everyone I wasn‚Äôt a screenwriter or director yet had *explained* a lifetime out of me.¬†

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I repeated, as flat as her assurance. ‚ÄúDo you want?‚Äù I asked her, holding up my glass, and when she nodded, I poured one for her.¬†

‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù She grabbed the glass I offered her and slurped before setting it down. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to change. Movie night, right?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYep.‚Äù I unpacked my too-hot container of General Tso‚Äôs and fried rice, shoved a pair of chopsticks in, and took it and my wine to the sofa to browse as she disappeared behind the wonky curtain contraption we‚Äôd rigged up when we first moved in to create a semblance of a bedroom border to change.¬†

‚Äú*Made of Honor?*‚Äù I called. Anything not a romcom was not an option. Our friendship was raised on them and reruns of *Grey‚Äôs Anatomy* in the early days of being locked in the dorms, because they were the only language we could both speak before we got to know each other. The only difference was, Sandy had grown up watching them on cable at her parents‚Äô summer cabin, while I‚Äôd trolled my overly sentimental mother‚Äôs out-of-date Blu-ray and DVD collection. All roads really did lead to Rome.

She hummed. ‚ÄúNo. Jaymes and I just saw that one.‚Äù¬†

I pulled a face out of sight. Jaymes was Sandy‚Äôs girlfriend-of-the-moment. They met through work, right before Christmas, and although they‚Äôd only been dating for two months and change, Sandy was spending more time with than without her these days. They were already talking about visiting Jaymes‚Äô parents in England over the summer.

Jaymes was nice. She liked Sandy. But when Sandy fell, it was hard, fast, and over before I knew it. At the rate they were going, they were looking to crash and burn by June, so it didn‚Äôt make sense to get to know someone who was going to leave, again.¬†

‚Äú*Pretty Woman?*‚Äù I suggested.¬†

‚ÄúOh my God!‚Äù Sandy appeared, hair askew and sweater still halfway on. ‚ÄúThat reminds me. You know that girl who lived across the hall from us at school? Laura?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúSure.‚Äù Not really.¬†

‚ÄúVery blonde hair,‚Äù Sandy continued, catching on I had no idea who she was talking about. ‚ÄúAlways carrying a stack of textbooks.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not exactly unique to the time or place,‚Äù I reminded her. ‚ÄúWhat about her?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI showed her an apartment the other day and she was with an older gentleman. Wearing a lot of designer things.‚Äù She waggled her brows with the amount of exaggeration only someone who was just on the other side of tipsy could do.¬†

‚ÄúSo?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúAbbie!‚Äù she howled. ‚ÄúCome on! She has a sugar daddy!‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúHow do you know?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúIt was pretty obvious,‚Äù she said, ticking off on her fingers as she went. ‚ÄúHe asked what she thought of the place and his name is the one on all the paperwork. And she called him her friend.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre friends.‚Äù¬†

She snorted and I sipped my wine. ‚ÄúNot like that we aren‚Äôt. You‚Äôre cute, but not my type.‚Äù

‚ÄúSometimes I think I should be offended by that,‚Äù I said. She rolled her eyes and I paused. ‚ÄúSo she‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúHas a sugar daddy,‚Äù Sandy said. ‚ÄúI could never. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with a knowledgeable woman empowering herself,‚Äù she quickly added. ‚ÄúBut I personally would sell feet pics before doing that.‚Äù¬†

I opened my mouth, but thought better of reminding her that wasn‚Äôt a choice she‚Äôd ever have to make. ‚ÄúGo get dressed. We have a movie to watch.‚Äù¬†



The first week, it was easy to keep my chin up. I found a job at a diner in midtown, and although it was only part-time, I told an obviously concerned Sandy I preferred that so I could focus on finding a new gig. The only leg up I had was my Ivy League degree, and that was a weak one ‚Äî without being a nepo baby, it was an uphill battle. Despite that, I told myself something would come along if I waited out the competition. Mind over matter.¬†

By the second month, as winter thawed into spring, anxiety was taking larger bites out of me. Where I used to break even each month, the one credit card I had was maxed out and the balance climbed even with every cent of my paychecks and tips going towards it. Sandy took gas, I took electric ‚Äî that was our deal since the beginning ‚Äî and two electric bills had already been put on it and if the decision on the request to review my student loan repayments didn‚Äôt come through before the third one, I‚Äôd have to turn out my pockets for spare change.¬†

To make matters worse, no shower in the world was long or hot enough to get rid of the acrid smell of burgers and oil permanently permeating my hair and pores, and my feet and lower back constantly ached from running plates back and forth between the kitchen and tables, even at reduced hours.¬†

But this couldn‚Äôt last forever and I hadn‚Äôt hit rock bottom yet¬†

And then I did.

I‚Äôd just gotten home from an afternoon shift when my phone dinged and I grabbed it reflexively in hopes of finding an answer to any *one* of the emails I‚Äôd sent over the last week. Instead, I froze, stomach sinking at the subject. The crack in my phone warped the screen, but not enough to muddle the crystal clear message that had just landed in my inbox. I scrolled slowly, every word I absorbed making my throat tighter.¬†

*Ms. Murphy:*¬†

*Thank you for getting in touch with our offices. We have reviewed your request to apply for income-based payments for your student loans. At this time, we regret to inform you‚Äî*

*Shit.* I didn‚Äôt need to read any further than that. Nothing good ever came after regret. Dropping my phone on the counter, I shuffled to the bathroom to clean the diner off me.¬†

Curled up in the corner of the couch, too defeated to even try to drown my sorrows in a bottle of the good wine Sandy had bought, I turned the television on and clicked through my options. On my third try, the poster for *Pretty Woman* caught my attention under the watch again tab and I hovered, lulled into a thoughtful trance by Julia Roberts‚Äô smile.¬†

The thought had never occurred to me, but now? Whether it was the movie, my chat with Sandy, my new sentence of smelling like beef for life, or a combination thereof that made every ounce of modern-day feminism evaporate from my soul was anyone‚Äôs guess.¬†

As a filmmaker, aspiring or otherwise, I went into pre-production mode and descended down a rabbit hole of research to browse apps and listicles from sketchy sources, which were about as helpful as that description made them sound. Some of them warned me about the pitfalls and others which assured me this was the *most* modern-day feminist I could be.

Sugar daddies and babies weren‚Äôt as cut-and-dry as I thought, but they weren‚Äôt as bad as my parents‚Äô generation would probably view them, thanks in part to the progress sex work had made as a whole. Some went on a first few initial meetings, decided it wasn‚Äôt for them, and moved on without ever having sex, while others dove on in or stuck it out long enough to make do and ensure the man was good for what he was promising. To probably no one‚Äôs surprise, there were a lot of scammers afoot.¬†

As heart-warming as the Adopt-A-Grandparent style stories were, though, there was no guaranteeing what one would want until we met. On the one hand, any amount of money I‚Äôd get for sex would be more than I was getting for how I was currently being screwed. But could I really be okay having sex for money? On the other hand, was it really so different? Laughing at bad jokes for an extra tip? Licking boots for the chance of a credit? Show business and waitressing both taught me early and fast how to swallow my pride and kiss ass to get ahead, it was just legalized. Or maybe it was worse, but honestly, with as few options as I had left, it didn‚Äôt feel like it.¬†

I was a grown and independent woman who had hopes and dreams, and I shouldn‚Äôt want someone to save me. But I was drowning and would give anything for someone with limo, a steed, or a Lotus Esprit to come rescue me, and there was no one in sight.¬†

But there could be.¬†

From the few apps that showed up with almost every search, I downloaded the one with the best reviews. The welcome screen looked like something from a report on politicians behaving badly, and I gnawed my lower lip, tapping each character for my email and password with delay and held my breath when I hit submit. The little spinning wheel went forever before a green check mark appeared with a message of successful registration.¬†

A lot of the profile questions were standard ‚Äî age (twenty-five), hair color, eye color (both brown), and height (5‚Äô7‚Äù‚Ä¶ish). My thumb hovered over the body type line, confidence deflating as I stared at the options. Not only were the choices borderline fetishizing (*more to love* sounded like a stuffed animal instead of a plus-sized woman), they made me acutely aware of the fact that I was *not* like the other girls. And not in a pick me way, either, but in a way where they could bend and make a perfect ninety-degree angle and I couldn‚Äôt. I was healthy in every other conceivably traditional way, but I could sheepishly admit to myself that diet and exercise weren‚Äôt top of mind for me with early call times and late nights, and the types of men downloading the app were probably looking for someone more conventional. This could all be over before it began, but at this point, what else did I have to lose?

I probably shouldn‚Äôt tempt fate like that.

When I was finished with a bio and some photos, I scrolled through the final product, chewing the inside of my lip. Cons? Potentially dangerous and next to impossible to explain to anyone now or ever. It was less taboo than a few years ago, but not nearly as mainstream as almost any other side hustle. The number of people I‚Äôd slept with was limited to ones I‚Äôd fallen in love with and only after that fact. If I did this, I had to be prepared for the possibility that could change.¬†

Pros? Money. A small word with a large meaning and an even bigger difference.¬†

Exhaling, I dimmed my phone and shoved it under my pillow It was a couple grand, a little relief, a cushion, and then I could end it all. A couple grand was a small price to pay for peace of mind.¬†



It took less than two hours for me to start receiving messages, three days for me to set a date, and five days for *the* day to come. The worst part was, well, me. Every man had seen my pictures and swiped right, but I was very aware that there were a thousand-and-one names *Mean Girls: The Musical* could teach me about the rolls that wrapped around my stomach, the arcs on the fronts of my thighs, and or the slightest double-chin that was starting to form from months of stress eating. I‚Äôd nearly called it off and deleted my profile multiple times, and only my credit card balance kept me in the game.¬†

He was‚Ä¶ fine. He was no Richard Gere circa nineteen ninety, but he was fine. Boring was actually a better word, but I‚Äôd take it over something worse, and after dinner, he handed me three hundred dollars before hailing me a cab and paying for that, too. I stared at the pile of twenties in my lap, quietly counting and recounting, equally shocked and thrilled.¬†

The high didn‚Äôt last long, though, because he didn‚Äôt contact me again, and three hundred dollars one time was as good as nothing. I kept my chin up, but the second man I made a date with stood me up, and when I went to check my messages, he‚Äôd blocked me, and the third one made me wish he had. Within a week, I was back to square one, and by the next, my standards were slipping. The money was only *easy* if I didn‚Äôt care whether a man was married, or if he could hold a conversation without sending a dick pic, or if they wanted to wine and dine me before trying to get me in bed.¬†

And I still hadn‚Äôt made up my mind about that. The sex thing. I wanted to feel empowered by this ‚Äî my body, my choice ‚Äî and I‚Äôd never slept with someone I didn‚Äôt love or wasn‚Äôt at least in some sort of semi-serious relationship with. The more messages I exchanged, though, the more obvious it became my first encounter was an exception, not the rule. If I wanted any amount of cash that would make a difference, I‚Äôd have to do more than listen to a few dad jokes, and I didn‚Äôt know if I was there yet or if I ever would be.¬†

My bank account was, though, so I popped any bubbling hesitations and kept swiping day and night. Until I had something better, this was still a viable option.

It was one of those increasingly desperate nights, lounging with a bag of chips in bed with Sandy‚Äôs snores puffing away in the background when *he* messaged me. I clicked to do a quick scan of his profile, and the first thing I noticed was the verified check along with the premium banner stretching across the top of his profile. The second thing I noticed was‚Ä¶

‚ÄúHoly‚Äî!‚Äù Chip crumbs flew down my windpipe and I coughed, tapping his photo to bring it full screen.¬†

He was *gorgeous*. The word devastating came to mind when I looked at him. The picture was cropped, effectively cutting off his arms, but seemed tall. He had a mop of dark, unruly hair, and friendly, warm eyes with an almost golden glow about him. The next one had dark restaurant lighting, but it was closer, and his shy, crooked smile made my stomach flip. He seemed more approachable than his quarter of a billion net worth ‚Äî a detail that boggled the mind, but he was verified ‚Äî and he was handsomer than the frat boys or bald businessmen loitering in my inbox.¬†

I clicked out and scrolled his profile with fresh eyes. No kids, no wife, no anyone, just him. He could be lying, but all I had to go with was what I was told.¬†

His message was simple.¬†

*Your pictures are beautiful. Is that Point Dume?*¬†

I stared. That was it? I had nice pictures and he was asking about the beach? It was almost‚Ä¶ normal. Like something I‚Äôd find on a real dating app. Or, even better, off one.

**Thank you :) You have a nice smile. And no - Montauk. Have you been?**

I‚Äôd no sooner hit send than the read receipt appeared, and I watched his typing bubbles.¬†

*Not yet. I‚Äôm moving to the city this summer, so maybe then.*

**I‚Äôd be glad to show you around if you‚Äôre up for it.** ¬†

I tapped my thumbs against the side of my phone. I‚Äôd shot my shot, and now all I could do was wait.

*I‚Äôm in town on Tuesday - it‚Äôs a little early for the beach, but if you‚Äôre okay with it, I‚Äôd like to take you to dinner to get to know you.*¬†

**I thought you‚Äôd never ask.**



**CHAPTER 2**  


We agreed to meet at the restaurant in the W Hotel in Union Square for an early dinner, and at four-thirty on Tuesday, it was just starting to fill up with other diners. I looked around from the table the ma√Ætre d‚Äô had ushered me to, trying not to make my nerves obvious even as I pulled the neckline of my cream cowl neck sweater and fanned myself. It wasn‚Äôt him showing up that had me in knots, it was the thought that he could change his mind or see me and decide he‚Äôd made the wrong choice. For better or worse, I needed whatever I could get out of this meeting.¬†

Twisting, I glanced over my shoulder as discreetly as possible, searching for anyone who resembled him even slightly. A sharp pain in my thumb made me hiss, and I flexed my fingers. My thumbnail cuticle was red and irritated from my anxious picking, and I brought it to my mouth to soothe the throb.¬†

‚ÄúExcuse me‚Ä¶‚Äù A rich, husky voice that was simultaneously tentative and confident addressed me, and I looked up, thumb dropping from my mouth.¬†

*Holy shit.*

In person, his hair was thick and rumpled, and without the bad lighting from some of his photos, his sharply angled face was more defined. His high cheekbones led up to bright hazel eyes that were nearly impossible to look away from, and two-day-old stubble lined his mouth. His forest green sweater almost hung off his broad, lanky frame, and I felt myself gulp under the chatter of the restaurant. Nineteen nineties Richard Gere had nothing on him.¬†

Unshaken by my extended silence, he held his hand out and I took it a second too late to be smooth. ‚ÄúHi,‚Äù I said at last.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice to meet you,‚Äù he replied. His palm covered almost my entire hand, and he smiled, not full blown, but a little bit coy and secretive, and I bit the inside of my cheek.¬†

‚ÄúNice to‚Äî you, too,‚Äù I stammered, tongue tied and kicking myself for it.

‚ÄúErm‚Ä¶‚Äù He chuckled softly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Sam.‚Äù¬†

Sam. I liked that ‚Äî it was soft but strong. It suited him if it was really his. ‚ÄúAbbie,‚Äù I said. Inwardly, I cringed. I probably should‚Äôve come up with an alias, but it was too late now.

He blinked slowly, smiling serenely, and when he squeezed my hand, warmth spread through me for an entirely different reason. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice to meet you. Sorry I‚Äôve kept you waiting.‚Äù¬†

To my immediate right, the sun beamed through the window, strong, courtesy of the slowly lengthening days, and I stole another glance at him as he picked up the wine list from the end of the table. In natural lighting he was just as, if not more, attractive than my first impression. He‚Äôd be the perfect candidate for a redo of *The David.* Unbidden, I had the thought, *What did a guy like him need with a girl like me?*¬†

‚ÄúWould you like anything to drink?‚Äù Sam asked, scanning the pages.

‚ÄúWater‚Äôs fine, thank you.‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt ‚Äî I wanted wine or worse to take the edge off, but unfortunately it was a bad idea to dive into a bucket of alcohol with a man I‚Äôd met five minutes ago.

‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù Gesturing to the menus to our side, Sam said, ‚ÄúThey have a good steak. Or the vegetable lasagna is very nice, too, if you don‚Äôt eat meat.‚Äù¬†

I did eat meat, but there was something considerate about how he‚Äôd phrased it. The men had ordered for me on the handful of other sugar dates I‚Äôd been on without really asking what I wanted. In my best first date voice ‚Äî the one I used to sound engaging and easy-going ‚Äî I asked, ‚ÄúWhich one would you recommend more?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúAh‚Ä¶‚Äù Sam scratched the back of his neck, staring at the menu, a sheepish smile tugging his cupid‚Äôs bow lips. ‚ÄúHonestly, it‚Äôs the desserts I‚Äôm a fan of. I‚Äôve got a bit of a sweet tooth.‚Äù He laughed quietly, cheeks pink and eyes averted in his juvenile admission.

‚ÄúIf you aren‚Äôt set on dinner, we could skip to dessert?‚Äù I regretted it the minute I said it and my stomach churned its revolution. Truth be told, I was fucking starving. If we waited much longer, the leg of the table would start to sound good. The allowance I gave myself on my cards for groceries and takeout was whittling away. A steak I didn‚Äôt have to serve *and* lasagna sounded amazing, as did the fries with pots of mayonnaise and ketchup two tables over, but I‚Äôd always been a good first date. If my *date* wanted dessert, then I wanted it, too.¬†

‚ÄúCoffee and cake,‚Äù he said, laughing again. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs very Sunday school.‚Äù My lips turned up, glad to be in on the joke, and I took the dessert card he passed across the table.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you want to look?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúI already know what I want,‚Äù he said with a very slight smile.

‚ÄúSweet tooth?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúSweet tooth,‚Äù he confirmed. There was something charming about his open soft spot for dessert, and under normal circumstances it might have put me at ease. I perused the card, its priceless listings heightening the anxiety compelling me to pick my thumb, and the resulting sharp pain reminded me of why I shouldn‚Äôt before I set it down. Sam lifted his head in anticipation.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôll have the lemon custard tart,‚Äù I said.

Nodding, Sam focused somewhere behind me, hand in the air, and seconds later, a waiter appeared with a frosty pitcher of water. He filled our glasses as Sam ordered my tart and a slice of carrot cake for himself, along with two cups of Earl Grey after I interrupted his coffee order.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not a coffee drinker?‚Äù he asked once our waiter whisked away.¬†

‚ÄúI like it,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúBut it makes me a little shaky.‚Äù¬†

His thoughtful hum brought us into silence. Under the table, I dragged my nails over my thighs and knees, the magnitude of the situation now impossible to ignore. Here we were, two strangers, with nothing to talk about except what brought us here. We should be able to *talk*, shouldn‚Äôt we? That was the bare minimum.¬†

‚ÄúSo‚Äî‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äî‚Äù

I bit my lip and he gave me a lopsided grin.

‚ÄúAre you nervous?‚Äù he asked. I shrugged with a sideways bob of my head and a bashful smile. Despite our dessert-only orders, our waiter deposited a basket full of hunks of baguette on our table.¬†

‚ÄúSo,‚Äù I began again. I plucked a napkin off my plate to cover my lap and grabbed a piece of the bread to give my fingers something to do. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre from California?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúL.A.,‚Äù he confirmed.

‚ÄúBorn?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúAnd raised ‚Äî right outside of it.‚Äù¬†

Flakes of crust littered the previously clean plate as I picked them off. He held up the bottle of olive oil on the table and drizzled some on my plate when I nodded. ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre welcome.‚Äù He followed suit with his plate and grabbed a piece, too.

‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre moving to the city this summer?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúTechnically I already have.‚Äù He tore his piece in half. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm staying here until I find somewhere. They‚Äôve got a nice pool ‚Äî I grew up swimming, so I‚Äôm a little choosy.‚Äù¬†

That explained the beach photo, although I couldn‚Äôt imagine having the money to stay in a place like this for one night let alone long-term. ‚ÄúIs that why you know the dessert menu so well?‚Äù¬†

His chuckle came from deep in his chest and he waited until he finished chewing to answer. ‚ÄúI knew it already,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúProbably one of the reasons why I decided to stay here.‚Äù Right as I smirked, two cups and saucers, a small basket stuffed with packets of tea, a pint-sized pitcher of milk, and a steaming pot of boiling water were set down.¬†

‚ÄúFor you, miss.‚Äù Our waiter placed a plate with a lemon custard set in a rippled pastry crust and dusted with powdered sugar in front of me. ‚ÄúAnd you, sir.‚Äù The frosting on the three-layer carrot cake had to be as thick as the cake layers themselves, and the outside of it was packed with finely chopped nuts.¬†

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù I murmured to the waiter‚Äôs back, abandoning my baguette. I selected a packet of tea, tore the bag open, and plopped it in my cup, but before I grabbed the pot, Sam beat me to it and tipped it over to pour. ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù Color leeched the water, and I bobbed it up and down as he prepared his own.¬†

‚ÄúI should probably be embarrassed about this,‚Äù he said, eyeing his cake.

‚ÄúBut you have a sweet tooth.‚Äù I‚Äôd meant it teasingly, but it felt more flirtatious than I‚Äôd intended. He smiled that lopsided grin, and I was glad I hadn‚Äôt taken my first bite, because I would‚Äôve definitely choked. Most of the men at the diner were either sweaty and balding execs who were very nice and tipped well, or finance bros whose attitude severely depleted their stock in conventional good looks. He was a jarring best of both worlds. It was like middle school all over again.¬†

‚ÄúI do,‚Äù he admitted, scraping his fork through the dense cream cheese frosting. ‚ÄúYou can have some if you‚Äôd like.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù I said yet again. I cut a small triangle out of my dessert with my fork and brought it to my mouth. It was creamy, bordering on too sweet, with enough lemony tang to make my lips pucker pleasantly. The crust was rich, buttery, and balanced the filling perfectly, and I exhaled through my nose in wonder. Swallowing, I thickly proclaimed, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs dangerous.‚Äù I could easily eat two and not be able to eat for a week from how rich it was.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôve had it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really nice with tea. You made a good choice.‚Äù¬†

We spent several bites in silence, each of us savoring our respective treats. ‚ÄúSo.‚Äù I desperately wished I could find another way to start a line of conversation than opening with *so*. ‚ÄúMay I ask what it is you do?‚Äù *Could* I ask? All the usual topics of small talk felt tenuous and uncertain. How much was too much? Were there rules? These were the sorts of things I was hoping to find out last night.¬†

Sam nodded and swallowed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a publicist. I work with entertainers, some social media personalities looking to transition.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúAnyone I‚Äôd know?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù¬†

My bite got stuck on the back of my tongue. He was so disarmingly cool about it. Like he knew I wanted to ask and also knew I wouldn‚Äôt. Swallowing convulsively, I cleared my throat. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs impressive.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúDo you think so?‚Äù His eyes glinted with humor but I didn‚Äôt know if I was supposed to laugh. ‚ÄúWhat about yourself?‚Äù He cut through his cake and his fork clinked against the porcelain.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm‚Äî‚Äù *definitely not in Hollywood.* Not right now, and maybe not even anymore. My bravery withered under his unbreakable gaze. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just a waitress.‚Äù¬†

‚Äú‚ÄòJust‚Äô?‚Äù He caught his next bite in his mouth, still holding eye contact, and he chewed, waiting for me to continue.¬†

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù I laughed softly and set my fork down to pick up my tea. ‚ÄúYou know, it‚Äôs not‚Ä¶‚Äù I trailed off, drowning the echo of every disheartening and degrading word ever said to me, explicitly or otherwise. A small, unfairly disarming smile pulled at his lips.¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs your job, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not something everyone can do.‚Äù I arched a brow. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know anything about waiting tables,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd have better luck with brain surgery.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not really hard,‚Äù I said. That was what everyone told me, so I told everyone before they could.

‚ÄúOh!‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou can do brain surgery? That makes sense, I guess. It‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs rocket science.‚Äù I snorted and he grinned. He was good at this, but he probably had to be. ‚ÄúSeriously, though,‚Äù he went on, the laugh lines around his eyes softening. ‚ÄúService is difficult. It‚Äôs hard for your living to rely on keeping your mouth shut.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYou would know. Publicist and all?‚Äù I took several scalding sips of tea. ‚ÄúWe both keep secrets of our own.‚Äù Never mind his were probably way juicier.¬†

Sam tried not to smile again and I took it as a point for me. ‚ÄúI suppose so,‚Äù he agreed. Leaning back in his chair, he said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hoping your secret-keeping will turn out in my favor. I‚Äôve got a wedding coming up.‚Äù He swapped his fork for his tea and took a sip, grimacing when it turned his lips a bright shade of pink. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs in Hawai‚Äôi, and I‚Äôm looking for someone who will go out there with me for the long weekend.‚Äù¬†

I struggled to keep a very straight face and used my own tea to hide my mouth when I couldn‚Äôt, and he cocked his head.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre thinking something.‚Äù¬†

I shook my head no, but he was right. Couldn‚Äôt he have a one-night stand? Find a girlfriend? Do literally anything else? He was gorgeous, well off, and in Hollywood. People should be crawling out of the subway grates to get to him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm surprised,‚Äù I began slowly. ‚ÄúI would‚Äôve thought this was‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†

He dug his hand in his hair and ruffled it. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to give anyone the wrong impression. I‚Äôve got too much going on to risk that.‚Äù The faint flush in the apples of his cheeks made abundantly clear he was aware of how callous he sounded. If I had my hopes up, I‚Äôd be hurt, and I appreciated his attempt to save someone from that. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a wedding, nothing more, and I‚Äôd like the person I go with to understand and be discreet. That‚Äôs all I ask.‚Äù¬†

I didn‚Äôt know if I believed that was all, but I didn‚Äôt think I would get much more if anything else.¬†

Measuring my words, I said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not a problem for me. I‚Äôm not looking for anything too‚Ä¶ much.‚Äù¬†

Tracing the silver pattern on his fork, Sam asked, ‚ÄúWhat is it you‚Äôre looking for?‚Äù¬†

*What was my cost?* ‚ÄúHow long would we be away?‚Äù I stammered more than I wanted, but I kept my head high. Julia Roberts got three thousand dollars for spending the week with Richard Gere, but I couldn‚Äôt work fast enough to convert it for inflation.¬†

‚ÄúThe wedding is on a Sunday,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm flying out Friday. You‚Äôre welcome to come with me, but I know you‚Äôll need to ask for time off.‚Äù¬†

I would have before, and even now I wanted time to prepare. ‚ÄúI do. I can fly Saturday? And we‚Äôre closed on Mondays,‚Äù I said, citing the diner‚Äôs schedule. Whether the regular rules applied or not, I didn‚Äôt want to seem too available.¬†

Sam nodded. ‚ÄúSaturday to Monday. I‚Äôll let you know before I book your ticket and the hotel.‚Äù My ticket and hotel. My very last-minute plane ticket to Hawai‚Äôi on a weekend for a wedding and the hotel that went along with it. I picked up my tea and took a sip to wet my mouth. ‚ÄúWhat else?‚Äù Sam asked quietly, pressing for the sum I hadn‚Äôt figured out.¬†

‚ÄúThirty-five-hundred,‚Äù I blurted. If someone pulled my sweater open right then, the dining room would turn into a sauna. ‚ÄúA thousand a day,‚Äù I continued, ‚Äúand five hundred for the overnight trip.‚Äù It was outrageous. I waited for him to balk, but Sam nodded as if I‚Äôd said *thirty-five* dollars.¬†

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs more than fair.‚Äù Was it? To me, it sounded like robbery. Was it *too* fair? I couldn‚Äôt dream about asking for more, though, as much as I couldn‚Äôt dream he‚Äôd say yes. *Thirty-five-hundred*. That was three months‚Äô rent and half of the next‚Äôs.¬†

With our desserts finished, Sam motioned for the check and, after a cursory glance, he slipped an unseen bill inside and handed it back to our waiter.¬†

‚ÄúThank you for dinner,‚Äù I said.

He grinned, but I‚Äôd already taken a breath to brace myself against its charm. ‚ÄúNot really much of a dinner, is it?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúEven for me.‚Äù¬†

Sam stood and swept around the table behind my chair, and I scooted back, grabbing my bag from the floor and following his purposeful stride from the dining room.¬†

‚ÄúWhich line are you on?‚Äù he asked, and, realizing he intended to take me to the subway if not take me home, I thought quickly.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about it,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be fine, I promise. I can let you know when I‚Äôm home?‚Äù¬†

He nodded and slowed to a stop in front of the doors in the lobby. ‚ÄúSure,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf you want.‚Äù Looking behind me, he touched my elbow, pulling me out of the way of a family of German tourists babbling softly amongst themselves. ‚ÄúCan I give you my number?‚Äù I must‚Äôve looked wary, because he rushed on. ‚ÄúI think it would be easier to touch base. You don‚Äôt have to use it, and I won‚Äôt ask you for yours. It‚Äôs an option if you want it ‚Äî I‚Äôm not sure how often I‚Äôll be on the app is all.‚Äù¬†

I nodded and dug through my purse before passing my phone over, and his thumbs flew over the keypad.¬†

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be in touch,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll let you know about your flight?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù I took my phone back. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs fine, whenever.‚Äù¬†

Sam took his wallet out of his pocket and slid out multiple twenty-dollar bills. ‚ÄúFor taking up your time.‚Äù He tucked them into his palm and held his hand out. I shook it belatedly for the second time that afternoon and he pressed the money into my grip.¬†

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThis was‚Ä¶ I had a good time.‚Äù Amazingly, I wasn‚Äôt lying. As stressful as it had been, this was easily the best first *something* I‚Äôd had in‚Ä¶ probably ever. Under normal circumstances, I would‚Äôve wanted something out of this. His eyes softened and the corner of his mouth lifted.¬†

‚ÄúI did, too. Thanks for coming.‚Äù¬†

Only the knowledge I‚Äôd been holding his hand a shade too long ‚Äî though wasn‚Äôt he holding mine, too? ‚Äî made me let go, and, with a wave and a sheepish half smile, I ducked my head and exited to the street.¬†

Whatever that was, I‚Äôd done it. There was a man in the city who‚Äôd never met me before today, and somehow I‚Äôd gotten him to agree to give me money and take me on a trip. I should feel like a con artist, and I kind of did even though I hadn‚Äôt told a single lie.¬†

I came to a stop at the corner light. My phone was still open to his contact screen, and, chewing my bottom lip, I tapped the call button. It rang long enough for me to be confident my number registered for him before I hung up and edited his name.

Yall came here from all walks of the internet. That's fine. I talk a lot of shit about tik tok, but even THEN I know I've seen some actually reliable information there, and I've seen misinformation in just about every other medium.

Long story short; you guys are being hand fed a LOT of information. A lot of it is bullshit. A lot of it is helpful.

I'm going to abstain from telling you exactly what's bullshit and what's not, because what matters right now is that many of you have no foundation for shifting except ""influencer said so, and I hope they're not lying."" As a result you'll try fucking anything.

That's fine. But I can perfectly understand WHY it's so hard to have faith in such an unhinged practice when the only evidence you have to go off of is public opinion; many of which have likewise asserted that they have ZERO experience in shifting and are going 3 years strong just like you are.

That sucks doesn't it? It can be pretty damn discouraging can't it?

Hey look. I'm not trying to tear down your belief, but I may suggest that perhaps the *reason* every anti shifter or naysayer can totally upend your belief is because *you didn't actually truly believe in shifting in the first place.*

I know what youre gonna say. ""Shit that's demotivating.""

Let me help you out here.

*Beliefs are way more fucking complicated than you want them to be.* If you truly believe then you'd have already shifted. If you truly believed you could walk on water then you would have. If you truly believed you had the force, then you'd have done so as a kid before going to bed. (Remember the light switch.)

You may have had moments where ""you were certain you believed"" or ""you were totally convinced and it still didn't work.""

No. You didn't. You may have successfully convinced your conscious self, but your subconscious is like an entirely separate intelligent entity, and it is *not* as gullible as you think it is.

It can be convinced with robotic affirmation, but the REASON that doesn't work for everyone, no the reason NO SINGLE TRICK works for EVERYONE is because everyone's subconscious is DIFFERENT. Every subconscious has their own lab. Their own infrastructure. Their own workstation. Their own rules of engagement. What works for one person, feels like a glob of jam shoved into the Large Hadron Collider for another.

And the reality is; your subconscious really does have a mind of its own. It plays by its own rules. It's dynamic. It's responsive. You can swoon a girl with a compliment once, but use the same lines for the 4th time in the row and she'll think your nuts. 100 times and she'll have given you a headpat out of pity or she'll have left the room entirely.

You need a proper relationship with your subconsciousness. You need a proper relationship with your intuition and understand what *belief actually entails.*

Some of you might be thinking ""well this person shifted without belief, or this person shifted in TERRIBLE conditions.""

Think about that. Can a blind person still hit a target with a rifle? Sure. Enough tries, and they just might land it. The same goes for shifting. Sometimes you land those sweet spots out of pure chance. 

And you all hear about this happening and decide to share the news; ""Jimmy blind hit the target! Jimmy hit the target! It is possible!

AND THEN YOU MOTHERFUCKERS SPEND THE NEXT 4 YEARS TRYING OVER AND OVER WONDERING WHY YOU CANT HIT THE DAMN TARGET.

Guys. You shouldn't be spending so long on this. I shifted the first time only 3 weeks after learning what shifting even was. Since then I shifted 2 more times and now I mini shift on a regular basis. It's still something I am genuinely figuring out, but you know what? I can SEE WHERE IM GOING, and I CAN PREDICT WHERE MY PROGRESS WILL LEAD.

You know what I HAVE been doing instead of shifting? No..  you know what ive been doing before I ever knew what shifting even was?

Manifesting. Manipulating reality. Getting the current world I live in to serve and obey my wishes. I have a relationship with my subconscious. I have a relationship with the medium that grants wishes and allows us to shift.

You wanna know the good part? Manifesting is 10x fking easier than shifting. Any of you could learn and get results NOW. If shifting was difficultly level for adults then manifesting is a difficultly level for grade school kids.

You gotta step away from the shifting thrill, accept that there's stuff you don't know, cut out the fluffy bullshit fed from every direction on every social media/content creator and learn how the universe actually works.

You need a foundation. Manifestation and the law of assumption is that foundation.

I've seen people say ""but I learned the law of assumption.""

Can you manifest extra cash on a whim? Can you manifest a free cup of coffee? Can you manifest what you see on TV? Can you manifest whos going to call or text you within at *least* a 10 day timespan? 

That stuff sound hard? It's not. Manifesting 1 million dollars can be hard. Manifesting an SP you love more than anything can be hard. Shifting can be hard. Cups of coffee are not hard. Extra cash is not hard.

This is all stuff you learn with basic applications of the law of assumption. You learn this and you'll get the foundation you need to understand shifting. You will develop a healthy relationship with your subconscious and learn to ACTUALLY manipulate your reality.

Don't get me wrong, there's bullshit circulating the manifestation side of the web too, but the catch here is THAT EVERYTHING is easy to test. Manifestation yields quick results. Shifting with no foundation and no relationship with your subconscious *can* take years. The reason that is so is because shifting is an EXTREME application of manifestation and the law of assumption that takes a SHIT TON of faith to do successfully.

Shifting is super advanced manifesting. You can still pull it off if you're lucky, but if it was easy then we'd have all already shifted. People wouldn't have spent 4 years without a single mini shift.

Honestly the fact people have taken upwards of years without results breaks my heart. I makes me genuinely wonder what the fuck content creators are feeding people.

So please study and EXPERIMENT with manifestation. Please learn to get results in the little things first. Learn how to induce lucid dreams. Maybe go hard and learn to induce astral projection. Shifting, making a million dollars, manifesting an SP; all of this stuff CAN be done for beginners, but most beginners simply hurt themselves. I have too.

That's one of the bitter ironies of manifestation and shifting; it's possible to get the big results as a newbies, beginners luck does seem to occur. but when it DOESNT work, it can seriously fuck up your life; as MANY of you have experienced. You learn more of WHY this occurs as you experiment with manifestation and LOA.

So please. Take a step back. Learn the basics. DO NOT put your life on the line. Be patient and practice the hard stuff when you're feeling SAFE, CONFIDENT, and READY. Get yourself free cups of coffee. Get yourself extra cash. Maybe get yourself laid. Don't stress.

Later. (Oh and please no DMs unless its urgent. I have too many people asking for help as is.)",5,1738029060.0,shiftingrealities,1,0.78,False

last night when I was watching TV, I noticed a lamp that was plugged into it shut off and back on quickly a couple times. Next morning the outlet wasn't working at all. No blown breaker and all GFCI switches are working properly. Removed the cover and there is no burning or melting or anything.



Went upstairs to a plug-in that is directly above it and it wasn't working either. All the other outlets around it work. Thinking something faulty happened in the wiring. I did have a plugin extender in it and had an electric kettle, coffee maker, grinder and lamp plugged into it and when I turn any of the other three on, the lamp would dim slightly.

I also did youtube EMDR meditation when I felt like spiraling thought wise and also avoided someone I know is a trigger for me during this time.

Here is a map I made of these spots: [https://www.mapcustomizer.com/map/LA%20Food%20Spots](https://www.mapcustomizer.com/map/LA%20Food%20Spots) Here you can see my ratings and price point for each. I think LA has a lot of great food and also a lot of food in general so it can at times be hard to find affordable and also good.

I don't drink coffee so I outsourced with friends. couldn't find much in the way of certain cuisines like German, Ethiopian, so I did not add to the list. felt like I probably haven't found all LA's good ones yet. would love to update the list this coming year.

I've been over this a bunch of times so we can just skip it.

The next thing on the agenda was The Event Lounge appealing the suspension of their occupancy permit. Not occupancy permit means no operation of the location. So, it's kinda serious. So the TL;DR was they got popped in 2022 for not getting a permit to renovate. Then in 2023 they got popped again for not having a business license and not paying city taxes. Then in November 2024 they got popped a third time for having alcohol at a college event without a liquor license, noise complaints, and ""unsafe structure"". The owners want you to know that they're veterans and that they didn't provide the liquor to the student party that got out of hand. Either way, they'll make a decision about it next week. Councilman Ferris asked if the license review board saw it and what they had to say about it, but staff replied that this sort of appeal goes straight to the Mayor and Council.

Keke's Breakfast Cafe is up for a liquor license. Full on beer and wine and Sunday permits. Don't quite know what a breakfast place needs a liquor license for, but that'll be up for a vote next week.

The Finance department came up and said that they needed to make some adjustments. They collected more Hote/Motel tax than expected, wages were higher than forecast due to no one quitting and adding a couple of positions, and the Cemetery fund spent more because they also had a windfall. Nothing particularly alarming, mostly good problem but still stuff they need to let people know about.

The city needs to authorize a sewer easement on the property that's the Public Works HQ. The county probably already has an easement since the sewer line is already there, but they can't find the paperwork for it, so they want the city to reissue it just to make sure that there's no problems down the line.

Another developer is trying to give the city a road again. This time it's Grenadine Circle in Villas at Hickory Grove. This time it can actually be classified as a road but it's outside of the 1 year warranty. So, it's probably just a developer trying to give the bill for repairs to the city. Eh, they might do it but they won't even consider if the developer doesn't send over a warranty deed and they only got a quit claim deed. (A Quit-Claim deed is cheap and easy and just assigns all the ownership of one person to another, but doesn't clear out anyone else's ownership claims. A Warranty Deed is one that ensures that all previous claims to ownership are cleared.) We'll see if they can clear title to the road.

Councilor Orochena had to recuse herself for this next one. Her parents are trying to buy out the city's right of way to their front yard. They have an appraisal that puts the value at $9,000. Councilman Ferris didn't like relying on the family's appraisal and wants the city to do its own. Staff was initially resistant, it's not a lot of money and if the surveyor was pricy then it could cost the city. Councilman Guiterrez asked how long it would take. Public Works said maybe a week, Councilor Viars said that in her experience it was a couple of days. The final decision was to come back to it next week, if the cost of city's survey was ~$500 then just do it but if it's more then they'll make a decision based on hoe expensive it'll be.

Councilor Orochena suggested that the Mayor and Council have a retreat to make sure everyone was on the same page. Councilman Jones has a lot of medical appointments in the next couple months and weekends seems busy for a number of council members. Councilman Ferris wanted a more specific agenda set, just having a meeting to have a meeting wouldn't be helpful for him. He wanted everyone to have clear goals or plans for the term to share in order for the retreat to make sense. They'll have to talk a little bit more about that in private before they schedule anything.

Councilman Jones wants a mural for McCollum Park. It'll be sent over to the new art director. Jones wanted a lot of input into the details of the mural, but that's why we got an art director. We'll see more about this as there is more to it.

Councilman Jones also wanted new official photographs. He wanted an American Flag background for the official photos. Other municipalities had flag backgrounds for their official photos. It didn't seem as though anyone else cared very much. The Mayor said it was like school photos and didn't want to spend the money, perhaps when they had to retake them anyways. Councilor Viars came out and said that it's not a priority.

Then it's time for the wrap up.

Councilman Ferris said that he missed the ribbon cutting of the Caboose because it was cold and he was drinking coffee, but he was impressed by the Trains! Trains! Trains! event at the museum when he visited Sunday. The Mayor noted that it must've been some coffee since the ribbon cutting was Saturday morning. Ferris noted that he had *two* cups, actually. He was also surprised by how many people who had come for the model trains were taking time for the regular exhibits as well.

Councilman Jones said that he really enjoyed the new Caboose exhibit and he thought that maybe a train ride like the one at the mall could be neat for next year.

Councilor Viars said that she enjoyed the tour. The Mayor then quizzed her on some of the trivia, which she nailed. Turns out the City Manager's boots are in the exhibit, too. She noted that Sunday was also very busy, something that hadn't always been the case at previous Trains! Trains! Trains!",7,1738028112.0,kennesaw,2,1.0,False

some context: we met in 2023 and everything felt so right‚Äîeasygoing, great banter, similar personalities, interests, values, fun dates and road trips, curating playlists, yada yada. something happened that deeply affected him around the end of 2023 which led to him pulling a slow fade and essentially ghosting me. we unfollowed each other off socials, went no contact for the entirety of 2024‚Äîuntil he randomly followed me again on instagram around late november.¬†i didn't follow back right away as i was so apprehensive and skeptical about these kinds of situations.

he took awhile to reach out but (surprisingly through text rather than dms) eventually asked me out for coffee around the beginning of december to apologize and things flowed just as naturally as before. we had honest, serious conversations about being exclusive and taking things slow because i mentioned how lovebomb-y he came off the first time around. he acknowledged the fact that things ended so abruptly (apparently because of a sudden death in his friend circle) how hurt i must've been due to the unexplained absence, how i was always on his mind, comparing our experience to every new person he briefly dated, which was comforting to me and kind of an ego boost (lmao sue me)

we spent quality time together throughout december and january, texting every day, bought me little gifts during most of our dates, planning future dates/trips, being intimate, etc. what threw me off a bit was when he brought up wanting to establish a more stable friendship, that he didn't want me to ""fall in love"" with him yet. at some point i met his parents and even wanted to invite me to hang out with his friends. but that was just that‚Äîplans, words, future faking.

he's in the process of moving from one city to one closer to me so i understand the stress that comes with it, but this past weekend he stopped texting me altogether. the weird thing is that the night before he even suggested we call real quick while he was driving to his friend‚Äôs place. last night i sent a quick ‚Äúhey is something wrong?‚Äù text and i found out that he blocked me on instagram.

i really should've known better that an issue that comes up early in a relationship will be the downfall; in this case it was his lack of communication skills and tendency to avoid conflicts by shutting down. trying not to be so hard on myself but this pain could've been avoided if i had blocked him in the first place. life goes on but i don't think i'll be dating in a long while",3,1738027686.0,ghosting,6,1.0,False

I have 25 diagnosed concussions. My freshman year of college, I was in a different state than my support system. One night I stayed up all until maybe 3am studying for an exam. I was recently concussed and hadn‚Äôt eaten all day. I was dehydrated and exhausted. I decided I needed to go to a fast food place, get some coffee and a bite to eat. Pulling out of the restaurant parking lot I passed out; I hit a pole and somehow managed to get my car across the street to an empty parking lot and was completely dissociated. The police show up, wake me from my stupor, I passed out at the wheel. 

They pulled me from my car and asked me if I had any impairments that may affect the test‚Ä¶. I responded with yes I have tbis and POTS‚Äù The responding officer administered the field sobriety test which was humiliating, i asked to be breathalyzed instead. I failed which I knew I would I was in the midst of vestibular therapy and couldn‚Äôt pass this guys standards in pt. I was then handcuffed, had my mug shot taken, and was thrown in a cell with some people who belonged there to say the least. It took 5 damn hours after me repeatedly asking them to administer the breathalyzer and help me, because at that point I was confused, dehydrated, and couldn‚Äôt comprehend the situation. I finally get to the breathalyzer and as I‚Äôm dropped of the cop said jokingly, ‚Äúthis one is excused for the breathalyzer.‚Äù Then I proceed to blow a 0.0. 

They finally let me go, wouldn‚Äôt give me a ride back to campus and just pointed in the general direction of my car. It was raining and maybe 45 degrees. I proceed to walk for maybe an hour and eventually find the parking lot I pulled into. My car was completely torn apart, everything from my glove box to the center console were torn apart. My stereo was ripped out and hanging from the wires.

I'm Confused.,"So about 5 years ago I was having runs of SVT and NSVT to the point where I was passing out (they caught it on my Holter monitor at the time.) I've had just about every possible test (Echo, stress, and EKG) and everything came back normal as far as any structural heart damage goes. They don't know what was causing it to happen. I don't drink, take any drugs, or anything like that. The only thing I do is have a cup of coffee in the morning.

Now for the last few years all I really get is PVCs and PACs occasionally. Some days I get hundreds, other days I don't have any. As far as the more serious arrythmias go they haven't really happened anymore over the last 3 years. Could it have just been a fluke thing? Do these things ever just ""cure"" themselves? I'm afraid that one day it's just going to strike again with a vengeance lol.

Gus is really set on the idea of chalking out the tires to decide who buys coffee for the episode. What if they used the odometer on the car instead. For example: if the number after the decimal reads 1,4, or 7 then Gus buys, 2,5, or 8 for Geoff, and 3,6, or 9 for Eric, that person buys coffee. This would eliminate the need to graffiti the vehicle and if the odometer for some reason doesn't have a decimal use the last number.

Now some immediate problems: what if the last number is a 0. I propose that the last person to buy gets to pick who buys out of the other two. Problem on launch, if the first time they try this it lands on 0, Gus will buy because the podcast is named after him, or Geoff because he wanted the name, or Eric because he's the producer. I don't know they can decide on that.

The next major issue: let's say Geoff is the main driver and he wants to go through the argous task of mathing out the route so it lands on a particular person to buy coffee. First, many years of RT podcasts, I think Geoff hates doing math. Second, I feel Geoff cares about the honor of games he would be all in favor of the randomness. Third, Gus and Eric would immediately sniff out any tomfoolery.

If they wanted to go crazy for 1-9, they could do a random number generator to decide what number belongs to whom.

Struggling with a cramped kitchen and wondering how to [organize your pantry](https://www.bestosmosisexperts.com/kitchen-pantry-shelving-ideas/) in a way that‚Äôs both stylish and functional? Small spaces don‚Äôt have to mean small ideas! 

With clever shelving solutions, you can transform your pantry into an organized oasis that works for your lifestyle.

Floating shelves are perfect for tight spaces, offering a minimalist yet modern look. Consider adjustable shelves to customize the height for everything from cereal boxes to mason jars. 

Corner shelves can maximize tricky spaces, and pull-out pantry organizers are lifesavers for keeping canned goods accessible. Don‚Äôt forget about vertical storage! Tall, narrow shelving units can hold spices, oils, or even your coffee stash while freeing up counter space.

Adding baskets or bins is another game-changer, making it easy to group similar items like snacks, baking essentials, or cleaning supplies. Pro tip: Label everything! It‚Äôs not just functional; it adds a charming touch.

I‚Äôm a 28-year-old from Europe, and I‚Äôm here looking for a connection that feels authentic‚Äîsomething built on shared understanding, good conversations, and maybe even a little magic. Whether we start with a friendly chat or dive into the bigger questions of life, I‚Äôm open to seeing where the journey takes us.

# A Bit About Me

* **Who I Am:**¬†I‚Äôm a writer at heart‚Äîsomeone who‚Äôs fascinated by the world‚Äôs little details and always looking to capture its fleeting moments in words. I believe there‚Äôs poetry in everyday life if you look close enough. I‚Äôd describe myself as curious, introspective, and quietly optimistic.
* **My Interests:**
   * **Music:**¬†I‚Äôm on a journey to become a vinyl collector (once I have the space for it!). I love crafting playlists that feel like soundtracks to moments in life, and I‚Äôm always hunting for new tracks that speak to the soul.
   * **Nature and Exploration:**¬†Whether it‚Äôs hiking to catch a golden-hour view, wandering unfamiliar streets, or just stargazing on a clear night, I‚Äôm happiest when I‚Äôm exploring.
   * **Creativity:**¬†I‚Äôve been dabbling in photography lately, trying to turn fleeting scenes into lasting memories. Writing has always been my first love, but this new creative outlet is giving it some competition.
   * **Gaming and Relaxing:**¬†On quieter days, I enjoy diving into a good game or settling in for a movie marathon‚Äîit‚Äôs all about balance, right?

# What I‚Äôm Looking For

I‚Äôm hoping to meet someone who‚Äôs as curious about life as I am. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôd love in a partner:

* **Kindness:**¬†You lead with your heart and care about the people around you. You‚Äôre the kind of person who finds joy in small gestures and values connection over pretense.
* **Curiosity:**¬†You see the world as a big, wonderful puzzle to explore‚Äîwhether that‚Äôs through travel, learning something new, or simply seeing the beauty in the everyday.
* **Openness:**¬†Life is full of surprises, and you‚Äôre not afraid to embrace them. You‚Äôre willing to share your dreams, your quirks, and maybe even your favorite coffee order.
* **Partnership:**¬†Someone who wants to build something together‚Äîa shared world full of laughter, quiet moments, and spontaneous adventures.

# Why Message Me?

I‚Äôd like to think I bring a unique mix of thoughtfulness and enthusiasm to the table. I‚Äôll remember the little things about you‚Äîthe way your favorite song makes you smile, the dreams you‚Äôre too shy to share, or the stories that light up your eyes. I‚Äôm loyal, steady, and the kind of person who shows up for the big moments and the small ones.

I believe in the magic of connection. Whether it‚Äôs through a shared playlist, a midnight chat, or a day spent exploring something new, I want to create moments that matter‚Äîmoments that turn into memories we‚Äôll always carry.

# Let‚Äôs Start a Story

If any of this resonates, send me a message. Let‚Äôs talk about music, share our favorite books, or dream up an imaginary trip to the most beautiful place we can think of. Or maybe we‚Äôll just start with ‚Äúhello‚Äù and see where the conversation takes us.

In college, all those girls moved away except for one, Maya who was not one of my childhood bullies. Over time, we became close friends‚Äîspending time together regularly and even transferring schools together. I thought we were best friends, especially when she seemed to grow apart from the others. I personally never noticed a change in those bullies and had grown apart from them after years of never being ‚Äògood enough‚Äô, so I had no issue not being around them. 

But, when the others moved back, start of last year after graduation, Maya became distant, stopped responding to texts, and overall was not a good ‚Äòbest‚Äô friend. 
‚Ä¢	On my birthday, I invited her to dinner, and she didn‚Äôt even realize it was my birthday.

Days later, she dropped off random lotions and candles from Trader Joe‚Äôs as a gift, which hey I appreciate! but she then said, ‚ÄúI just grabbed whatever lol! hope
you like them :) .‚Äù ‚Ä¶. Meanwhile, for her birthday, I planned a party with all those friends, baked her a cake, took her out to a nice dinner on a separate night just us 2 (which I paid for), and ordered her a custom book embosser with her name.
‚Ä¢	Months later, after never saying anything to her about my birthday, she went on a trip with those girls and ignored me when I innocently asked where she was going after she vaguely said she‚Äôd be ‚Äòout of town‚Äô and couldn‚Äôt hang out. Months after that, again after barely seeing her, she had a little party at her house, me and their group of 4. I put 2 and 2 together because all night they had hush-hush conversations about the trip, openly talking about how ‚Äúthe four of them‚Äù were a group‚Äîwhile I was the only other person there aside from one of the boyfriends lol. Not a great feeling to find out I had been excluded behind my back while being excluded to my face :( 
‚Ä¢	A few weeks later I shared how I felt while we were grabbing some food and she claimed I was a ‚Äúone-on-one friend‚Äù and she didn‚Äôt mean to hurt me but promised to include me in their ‚Ä¶ book club.

I thought our convo went well enough though, and I know I can be sensative, so I let it go and things were good‚Ä¶ but then she never added me. 

After about 2 weeks of contemplating whether or not to text her to remind her (which felt like begging to be included to me) I sent her a long emotional text (I know, not the best move), and then we didn‚Äôt speak for six months, (See texts).

When I asked if we could hang out for a little and talk in her car after coffee, she said she didn‚Äôt have time because she had to go see another one of her friends, but added ‚ÄúI hoped enough time had passed that we wouldn‚Äôt need to talk about it.‚Äù Ouch. 

On the way home to drop me off, about 10 minute drive, I tried explaining myself‚Äîthat I wasn‚Äôt upset she had other friends, but it hurt being lied to and treated like an afterthought. That those specific girls trigger something in me about being bullied as a kid, but that maybe my dislike for them was mine to get over and that maybe I need to warm back up to them etc - Before I even got to have a well rounded mature conversation where I took some blame for being sensative and could explain that I held no anger towards her - she got angry, clearly did not want to talk about it, and said ‚ÄúI dont even remember what I did that hurt you‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôve already given you all I could so maybe we shouldn‚Äôt be friends‚Äù, That she had ‚Äòadded several people‚Äô, in the time we didn‚Äôt speak, to the book club and never added me because I got mad at her before she could. Just endlessly telling me she didn‚Äôt care in various ways. 

So I got out of the car at my house and stopped the conversation when she said ‚Äúmaybe we shouldn‚Äôt be friends‚Äô because I realized 6 months of space wasn‚Äôt about respecting my feelings‚Äîit was her trying to calm down about angry she was that I was ‚Äòhurt‚Äô and needed to talk about it because god forbid ‚Äòbest friends‚Äô to talk about their feelings. 

Should I keep trying with this friendship, or is it time to let go?

--------------------------------------------------------------

Integrating smart home devices in your kitchen can transform your cooking experience and simplify daily tasks. These devices not only add convenience but also help in improving efficiency and luxury in one of the most important areas of your home. Here are some benefits that come with adopting smart home technology in your kitchen.

### Enhanced Convenience and Efficiency

Smart appliances can significantly boost your kitchen's convenience. Imagine preheating your oven from your smartphone while you‚Äôre finishing up at the grocery store. With smart ovens, you can control the temperature, set timers, and even receive notifications when your meal is ready. This level of control allows you to multitask effectively.

Robotic kitchen assistants, like smart speakers, let you set reminders, and play music, or even provide recipes hands-free. By integrating these devices, your kitchen becomes more user-friendly and your cooking tasks become less time-consuming.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/smart-home-devices-kitchen  
  
### Energy Saving Features

Smart home devices can also contribute to lower energy consumption in your kitchen. For instance, smart refrigerators can monitor food inventory and suggest recipes based on what you have. This can help reduce food waste and save money on groceries. Moreover, many smart kitchen appliances are designed to use energy more efficiently.

- **Smart Thermostats:** They can learn your cooking patterns and adjust the heating or cooling of your kitchen accordingly.
- **Energy Monitoring Plugs:** These devices track the energy usage of your kitchen gadgets to help you identify areas where you can save.

### Improved Food Safety

Smart kitchen devices can significantly enhance food safety. For example, smart refrigerators have technology to keep your food at the optimal temperature. They can also alert you if the temperature rises, helping to prevent spoilage.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/smart-home-devices-kitchen  
  
Moreover, devices like smart thermometers can ensure that your meats are cooked to the right temperature, making your meals safer to eat. This knowledge reduces the risk of foodborne illnesses and gives you peace of mind while cooking.

### Seamless Recipe Integration

One of the most exciting aspects of smart devices in the kitchen is their ability to help you with recipes. Smart speakers or displays can guide you through complex recipes step-by-step. You can simply ask, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs next?‚Äù to get real-time instructions while you cook.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/smart-home-devices-kitchen  
  
This feature is especially helpful for beginners or for those trying out a new recipe. You can avoid the hassle of constantly checking back at the recipe book or screen. Instead, you can focus on creating delicious meals.

### Personalized Cooking Experience

Smart kitchens allow you to personalize your cooking experience. With smart devices, you can store your favorite recipes and create meal plans that cater to your dietary preferences. For instance, if you are prepping a vegan meal, smart ovens can suggest the best settings to achieve the perfect dish.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/smart-home-devices-kitchen  
  
Additionally, some smart devices can learn your cooking habits over time and tailor recommendations to suit your tastes. This customization ensures that your kitchen evolves with you, making cooking more enjoyable.

### Remote Monitoring and Control

With smart home devices, you can monitor your kitchen remotely, giving you peace of mind. Smart cameras can help you keep an eye on your cooking, allowing you to manage your tasks without being physically present in the kitchen. You can also adjust settings on your appliances while you‚Äôre away from home.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/smart-home-devices-kitchen  
  
This feature is particularly useful for busy families. You can start dinner preparations before returning home from work or check if you left an appliance running. Remote access offers safety, convenience, and makes cooking less stressful.

### Boosting Kitchen Aesthetics

Integrating smart devices can enhance the aesthetics of your kitchen. With sleek designs and modern technology, smart appliances look stylish and can greatly improve your kitchen's overall appeal.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/smart-home-devices-kitchen  
  
Devices like smart lights can also be programmed to change colors and brightness, setting the perfect mood for cooking or entertaining guests. This modern touch can elevate your kitchen into a more inviting space.

Embracing smart home devices in your kitchen does wonders for enhancing the cooking experience. From energy savings and improved food safety to a personalized touch, these devices empower you to cook with confidence while bringing efficiency and opulence to your home.

Precise measurements are crucial in cooking, and a smart kitchen scale ensures you get them right every time. These scales connect to your smartphone and can provide recipe suggestions based on the quantities you weigh.

So many sellers pour hours into their listings‚Äîperfecting photos, writing descriptions‚Äîonly to wonder why the traffic isn‚Äôt coming.

Here‚Äôs the thing: visibility isn‚Äôt just luck‚Äîit‚Äôs strategy.

# 1. Stop Guessing Keywords‚ÄîStart Using Buyer Language

Your customers aren‚Äôt typing ‚Äúcute mug‚Äù into Etsy. They‚Äôre searching for things like ‚Äúcozy Christmas coffee mug‚Äù or ‚Äúpersonalized gift for tea lovers.‚Äù

Use Etsy‚Äôs search bar or tools like eRank to find exactly what buyers are typing. Then, sprinkle those keywords in your titles, tags, and descriptions.



# 2. Think Like a Window Shopper

Did you know shoppers decide in **3 seconds** if they want to click? Your photos are the key.

* Bright light = pro quality.
* Show the product in action (a candle glowing on a nightstand > just a plain candle).
* Multiple angles = trust.

**Tip:** Test your thumbnails to see which gets the most clicks.



# 3. Ride the Trends Before They Boom

The sellers crushing it right now? They jumped on trends **early.**

* Use Pinterest trends or Etsy‚Äôs search bar to spot what‚Äôs gaining traction.
* Add seasonal keywords like ‚Äúholiday,‚Äù ‚Äúsummer,‚Äù or ‚Äúback-to-school‚Äù to your listings.

# 4. The Algorithm Loves Activity

Stale listings? The Etsy algorithm hates them.

* Refresh your listings with updated tags, descriptions, or photos.
* Add new products regularly to show Etsy you‚Äôre active.

Think of it like watering a plant‚Äîthe more attention you give, the more growth you‚Äôll see.



# 5. Ads Don‚Äôt Need to Break the Bank

Done right, Etsy Ads can skyrocket your shop‚Äôs visibility.

* Start small and test which listings perform best.
* Focus on products that already convert well organically to maximize ROI.

Marge and I (Harold) have been coming to this gym every Tuesday and Thursday for the last decade. It‚Äôs our little routine ‚Äì she sticks to the yoga mats, and I spend a good 45 minutes pretending to know how to use the machines. But today? Today was something else entirely.

We were by the free weights, minding our own business, when it started. First, there was the girl on the bike ‚Äì you know the type, all fidgety, like she‚Äôs trying to hide the fact that she‚Äôs watching someone. And who was she watching? That tall guy with the nice shoulders who always looks like he‚Äôs auditioning for a fitness magazine cover.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs got a thing for him,‚Äù Marge whispered, leaning over like it was a spy operation.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not subtle,‚Äù I replied, watching as she pedaled like her life depended on it, sneaking glances his way every five seconds. At one point, her hair flew into her face, and she nearly fell off the bike trying to fix it. ‚ÄúThis is better than cable,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúLook, Harold,‚Äù Marge nudged me, ‚Äúhe caught her staring! Oh, this is going to get awkward.‚Äù

Sure enough, he glanced her way, and you‚Äôd think she‚Äôd been hit with a taser. She froze, tried to act nonchalant, and then wiped her sweat like she was auditioning for a deodorant commercial.

Then there was the moment that really sealed it. She‚Äôd clearly overshot her ride ‚Äì she must‚Äôve been aiming for 20 miles, but the girl was at 35 and counting. She wasn‚Äôt pedaling for fitness anymore; she was pedaling for love. ‚ÄúThat girl‚Äôs planning their wedding in her head,‚Äù Marge said. ‚ÄúGuarantee you she‚Äôs already picking baby names.‚Äù

But oh, the plot thickens. About ten minutes later, foam roller girl decided to make her move. She got up, wobbled over like a newborn giraffe, and made some sort of noise. At first, I thought she sneezed, but no ‚Äì it was her attempt at saying ‚Äúhi.‚Äù Marge and I had to turn away to keep from laughing out loud.

To his credit, tall guy said ‚Äúhi‚Äù back, but the poor girl looked like she short-circuited. He made a joke about waiting for her to say something, and she responded in the most awkward way possible: she asked him for coffee and then almost fell over a bench press trying to leave.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a mess,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúBut an endearing mess,‚Äù Marge replied. ‚ÄúI like her spirit.‚Äù

We stayed just long enough to see her scurry back to her foam roller and pretend like the last three minutes didn‚Äôt happen. Tall guy, bless his heart, looked both amused and confused.

‚ÄúThink he‚Äôll go for it?‚Äù I asked as we grabbed our towels.

‚ÄúOh, he‚Äôs going,‚Äù Marge said with the authority of someone who‚Äôs seen a lot of life. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs curious now. And besides, she‚Äôs got moxie. That‚Äôs how I got you.‚Äù

The white rug is moving elsewhere and being replaced with another similarly-sized. Fuzzy rug is just there to de-crease, please disregard that. Ottoman stays somewhere in this room (it's the cat's, I have no choice in the matter) and terrible coffee table will be replaced with something more fitting as soon as something speaks to me. Runner thoughts? Happy to provide more photos for context!  ",1,1738025243.0,HomeDecorating,1,0.67,False

Hi internet stranger ! I‚Äôm just a girl (cue the song ) . I‚Äôm hoping to meet a dumbass who is into dumbassery just as much as I am . Some one to text and share stupid stuff with on the daily .So if you have a dash of dumbassery , a galactic twinkle in your eye and think you‚Äôre able to hold a conversation let‚Äôs be friends ;) 

First abit about me : I‚Äôm writing this while drinking tea and having a smoke I‚Äôm watching a Dutch streamer play phasmophobia .sometimes I‚Äôm funny but don‚Äôt ask me to tell a joke ( that‚Äôs not how it works bro ) fun fact I hate movies and also ice cream( no I don‚Äôt have reasons why I just don‚Äôt , it‚Äôs not that deep ). I have adhd and because of that I have a new hobby or interest each week . I like reading watching the most random shit on YouTube , baking , walking , making a million playlists that I‚Äôll never listen to again and adding them to my iPod for optimal vibes  and journaling. I speak 3 languages and am learning a 4th ! I love dogs 100% but cats 101% .that‚Äôs about it nothing special . 

**Things to expect if we become friends**

- Goodmorning messages (might not be sent in the morning )
- a lot of random playlist I‚Äôve made 
- complaints about nonsensical things
- someone that you can annoy at any time of  the day 
- someone to have coffee dates with virtually 
- just someone willing to listen to your rambles /ideas/thoughts/feelings 

**disclaimer**

**DONT JUST SEND ME HI /HELLO/HEY/HOW ARE YOU ? If you do this I probably won‚Äôt answer so please send me a none boring intro (not just listing your hobbies pretty please )** 

Does that sound good to you ? If yes text me ;) if no text me anyway ;)) ",0,1738025152.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,0.5,False

The only jobs I had before were in coffee shops and one time I was a receptionist at a hair salon. Those jobs were so draining because of the amount of social interaction and I know I need to find something different, I just don't know where to look. I don't have a degree and so I would need something that doesn't require that level of education or past experience. If anyone could recommend me jobs that aren't heavily customer service based (and please NO food service) I would greatly appreciate it. I know I'm only qualified for minimum wage and that's okay, I just don't want to spend 40 hours a week socialising. I know some level of that is required for all jobs but I would like to have something where I can do a good amount of solo work. Any recommendations are welcomed.

1ibp5cv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ibp5cv,"Review #5: Larceny Barrel Proof, Batch B524","It's Monday, and you know what that means: a wheated bourbon review!!!  Larceny barrel proof is one of the most recommended bourbons on here, so it was one of the first bottles I picked up when I decided to rebuild my collection.  Personally I'm still skeptical of the whole batch thing, where one batch or the other or something is good and another one is not so much. To me, if there's no change in the actual ingredients or aging, it feels like a way to fuel people's FOMO and get us to buy as much as possible. Then again, that's mostly speculation since I haven't been collecting multiple batches of the same thing to compare. 

Price: $64.99

Proof: 125.4

Age: around 6 years?

Nose: Cinnamon candy, leather, dark cherry, some faint citrus. I can smell the influence of the wheat but not sure how to quantify it. Low ethanol for the proof, oak is pretty faint. Some herbal cinnamon (as in the spice) as well. As the glass gets closer to empty, there's more of a woody and citrusy scent that I like, with an oddly milky element to it.

Taste: Medium body, thinner than I'd expect. Cinnamon candy/Red Hots is the first thing that comes to mind. Again with what comes across as leather, maybe some sweet coffee or latte at the end. I definitely detect what I think of as ""youthful notes"" in this, there's a sharpness to it and it's very drying, almost uncomfortably so. It doesn't stick around long after the sip aside from some dry tannins and slight bitterness, which seems odd for a 6 year old product, but what do I know.

Overall: 6.5 (Very good). This is a weird one for me, there's a lot to like but at the same time it doesn't really stand out as anything amazing or otherwise notable. Part of this is undoubtedly due to my expectations coming in, with so many people calling it a top 10 of the year I'm left thinking ""it's good, but really?"" THEN AGAIN, that could be where the batches come into play. Maybe there really is a significant difference? In any case, this bottle is the closest to empty in my current collection, so it's not like I don't enjoy it. I just can't help but feel that it's overrated a bit.

Buy again: normally I'd say no, but with all the talk of different batch numbers, I think I'm going to give it another chance. I might wait til one comes out that has everyone raving and compare the two. Otherwise, it's good, but I wouldn't get it again at $65. For $40-50, sure!

I've been doing my best to go through the grieving process and deal with the reality that for half my days (when my ex has our kid), I am alone unless I put effort into making plans. Although I have lots of friends and a great community, most of them are coupled up and have kids. I need more single friends to hang out and go to events with on my kid-free days. I'm on dating apps, but that hasn't shown to be a good way to make friends.

I live in Nob Hill and work at UNM. I'm very far left politically and am not interested in spending time with anyone even close to center. Age/gender doesn't matter as long as you're kind, compassionate, and are willing to reciprocate in a meaningful friendship.

Things I enjoy: 
-Riding bicycles (faster, longer rides)
-Hikes and urban walks
-Live music (esp. punk/indie/alternative)
-Dancing (upbeat/EDM)
-Billiards (please be good) 
-Pub games (like darts) 
-Board and card games
-Karaoke
-Art shows
-Crochet
-Camping
-Baking
-Overly involved discussions about the complexity of existence
-Coffee
-Craft beer and fancy cocktails
-Dogs (I'm sadly allergic to cats)
-Community organizing

I feel like this is potentially a pointless exercise, but it would be great to find some other single people who want to go out and actually do stuff the rest of this winter. Thanks!",59,1738024918.0,Albuquerque,58,0.79,False
