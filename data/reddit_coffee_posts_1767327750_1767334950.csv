This is just based on my personal preferences.

Gods and churches come up pretty often in PF. I've seen two common tropes in such appearances:

1. Gods are jerks - ranging from negligent to evil. I'm specifically excluding cases where you have a D&D-style ""good gods vs evil gods"" situation, but rather where the ""benevolent"" gods are revealed to be bad. They might be the cause of some kind of bigotry in the setting, or they might be suppressing the power of mortals, or they just enjoy watching mortal conflict without caring about suffering.

2. Gods are just people - gods are presented as extremely human; they have the same emotions, same general actions, and notably many of the same (mental or emotional) limitations. Gods that are petty, or flippant. They can create miracles, but they're still distractable and jealous. Alternately/also, they're presented with mundane trappings. Their divine role is just a ""job"", sometimes down to the cubicle and coffee cup.

This also typically extends to divine servitors, angels, and churches based on those things.

I am interested in suggestions for PF books and series that avoid those tropes and instead have ""noble"" divinities. Entities that feel benevolent and *vast*, in more than just their power but their scope of thought.

Tolkien would be somewhat of an example. The involvement of the ""gods"" (the Valar and Iluvatar) in the main story is minimal, but their representation is what I'm talking about; entities like Varda or Manwe don't solve all of humanity's problems, and can even make mistakes and cause problems - but they are clearly overall benevolent, and act at a mythic scope; you wouldn't have Varda walking around with a ""#1 god"" coffee mug.

Anyone have recommendations based on these preferences?",1,1767334690.0,ProgressionFantasy,0,1.0,False

The first thing I felt was that I became a lot happier and more motivated, almost like I had drunk a coffee. I was talking more, felt more alert, and just more social in general. This was definitely stronger with L. reuteri than what I later noticed with Bifidobacterium longum.
The second thing I noticed was spontaneous erections, including during the day. It caught me off guard, especially since I wasn’t expecting anything like that from a probiotic.

For some context, I’ve become pretty sensitive to probiotics over the last couple of years and I get histamine reactions easily. Because of that, I decided to start slow with Bifidobacterium longum, since it’s supposed to help lower histamine signaling. And interestingly, I noticed similar libido type effects with it too, even from just one capsule with 1 billion CFU. That said, the social and alert coffee-like feeling wasn’t as strong as with L. reuteri.

I did a bit of digging afterward and it seems there might be some gut brain or nervous system involvement with certain strains like L. reuteri and B. longum. Some sources mention things like blood flow, signaling, and even oxytocin pathways, which could maybe explain the mood and libido changes, especially in more sensitive people. Still kind of surprised me how noticeable it was.

 I'll leave the group even if they're my closest friends. Shattered and alone. I don't think that they are like that, but who knows.

2. ""Is this a joke?"" And just ignore that I ever said that. 
Would make me feel humiliated and ashamed.

3. ""Ehh, okay"". And then would struggle calling me by he/him and would be weird about it. 
Makes me feel sad, but probably most likely scenario.

4. ""I knew no woman is playing the *game we all met at*"". Then they could ask some uncomfortable questions, but they'll move on.
 About no woman playing that game is just a community half-joke, I thought I was breaking that rule, but I guess I'm not.

So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

I’m 5’11, fair-complexioned, and currently at a point where I’m not looking for a ""forever"" commitment, but I’m definitely missing that spark of connection. I’m looking for something casual, but with a lot of heart.
I love a good deep dive. Whether it’s about life, weird theories, or just how our days went, I want to actually know you.
I’m big on romance and cuddles. If we’re hanging out, I want it to feel warm and comfortable.
I love random meetups. Whether it’s a last-minute coffee, a walk, or just grabbing food because we’re both bored, I’m down.
A bit about me: I’m easygoing, a good listener, and I value chemistry above everything else. I believe the best ""casual"" relationships are the ones where you actually enjoy each other's company as much as the physical side.
If you’re looking for someone to relax with. You want the perks of romance and intimacy without the heavy ""where is this going?"" talk right away. You’re down for a slow burn and see where things lead.

We typically don't even enjoy most commercial American chocolate now. For fruit candies I buy brands like Yum Earth. We also are somewhat low sugar? Not a deal breaker.

Our flavors would be things like PB, caramel, nuts, mint, fruits, marshmallow, coffee- they also like trying uncommon stuff. 

I am trying to track down something nice for us to enjoy. I shop at Walmart, Aldi, occasionally Kroger or Meijer, & Amazon. 

I also am trying my best to find something i can use my food stamps for, but if I really have to pay a little bit I will.

1q1qtur,https://www.reddit.com/r/SameGrassButGreener/comments/1q1qtur/help_me_relocate_out_of_hawaii/,Help me relocate out of Hawaii,"Hi everyone! I am hoping you can help me pick where to relocate from Oahu. I’ve been stewing on this for a while and just can’t figure it out. I currently live in Kailua and it’s my dream town. I love the lifestyle, the lush greenery, the little downtown area with shops, easy and beautiful beach access. The thing is, I’d like to own a home and I can’t do that here. Also, family is on the east coast and parents are getting older. I am pushing 30, female, single, and I don’t enjoy the dating scene here. The transient lifestyle of the island has caused me a fair share of heartbreak from friends and relationships moving away. I’m fairly lonely on Oahu now and looking for some long-term friends. 

My dream town is by the ocean. I might be open to west coast, something like San Diego, but I’d prefer the east coast. Id like to buy a house in a few years for 300k or under, though. I can’t tolerate cold cold weather, especially since I work outside. My dream is to have a little yard, get a dog, have nightlife and/or a cute downtown. I love workout studios and getting coffee. I’d consider myself mostly liberal, but I can tolerate a “purple” city! 

Some places I’ve considered:

Charleston: I liked Charleston when I visited! I would worry there’s less outdoor activities and excitement but maybe I didn’t find the best things to do when I visited! I’m worry about being bored. Having a little bit of a fall/winter may be appealing. I do worry about the ability to make friends here, thinking people may have established circles. 

Tampa/st Pete area: I didn’t love downtown Tampa. It felt a little soulless to me. Clearwater beach was a little touristy for me. Downtown st Pete, the vibe was almost correct! But maybe a little too gentrified feeling, and I’d like a more established area. I’d like easier access to the beach and there were no waves!!! 

New Smyrna? Surrounding Miami area? Ft. Lauderdale? I grew up going to the keys and I really enjoyed the vibe. 

I have family in Toms River/ Brick, NJ area as well that could be nice to have nearby, but this is bottom of the list.

So I did an experiment as my downstairs skin had ingrowns, dryness, discoloration, and wrinkles.

I microneedled at 1mm with Ronas stem cell serum. Then I meso-ed a syringe of jeunetique PN.

The stem cells make healing really fast which is why I knew that infection would be less likely. I was still really nervous about infection and I did thouroighly cleanse with antiseptic before and again after 8 hours (applied hyaron after the 8 hour mark cleanse). Everything feels great and I just use the meriket regenerating calming cream as a thick moisturizer while it continues to finish healing.

Notes: I used numbing cream prior and then thoroughly washed it off before starting. I avoided the vulva completely. Only focusing on the type of skin that would grow hair if that makes sense.

I air dried for awhile laying down and then wore clean LOOSE pajama shorts and went to sleep or stayed laying down so I wouldn’t irritate it or expose to pathogens.

I can see this would be a very risky procedure because of our body’s bacteria like staph etc.

I’m not recommending this, I’m just letting you know it’s possible and I’m looking forward to do a few more sessions to get better quality skin. 

Let me know if you guys do anything to help

Downstairs skin and /or ingrown scars(discoloration). 

I probably would have just done a coffee scrub or sugar scrub and kept it simple but my skin felt like it needed something stronger in my opinion. And the polynucleotides should help my skin quality and smoothness.",3,1767333426.0,DIYaesthetics,0,1.0,False

Fresh Falls - Loved the scent. It can come across as a generic sporty cologne type scent but it I found it very pleasing in a way I never got tired of. It gave a faint aroma in the bathroom after use. If it only had some grit it could easily be my favorite.

Pine Tar - Another great scent. It was a sweeter pine smell to my nose. Good grit from the oatmeal. Would be ranked higher if not for staining the bottom of my white shower. The stains were removable of course but had to put in a bit of elbow grease.

Wood Barrel Bourbon - A solid bar. A lot of people adore this one but, for my personal taste, the scent of some of the other O.G. bars outshine this one (Fresh Falls, Rainforest Rapids, Bay Rum). A great feel from the grit though with the medium grit leaning a bit heavier.

Flamin' Hot Bricc - Probably a controversial spot on the list. I absolutely hated this bar when I first got it. It made my stomach turn a bit. Everything it came in contact with left it's odor behind. It's pepper juice mixed with lime scent was so bad I had to isolate it in the garage until I worked up the courage to use it. Easily the most potent bar I have tested. However once used in the shower, the spice/pepper toned down quite a bit and became a bit fruity. The scent in the shower was amazing and I enjoyed using it each day. The grit was more medium than heavy. If it wasn't for it's horrid, between shower scent it would have been much higher for me.

Rainforest Rapids - At first I did not like this bar in the box. It had a strong, sharp clean floral scent that kind of stung my nose. However, when used in the shower, the

sharpness calmed down and the florals became quite pleasant. It had an amazing feel with the grit that was more medium than light. It left it's scent not only in the bathroom between washes but on my skin as well.

Bay Rum - A great scent that reminded me of a good smelling hotel room/lobby. It had a nice cinnamon like scent that was pleasing to use in the shower. I wish the scent was much more potent however as it's really weak. I enjoy bars with grit more so that played a factor in it's lower ranking as well.

Scrub Smash - I didn't mind the spicy cucumber scent in the box and looked forward to using it as I found some of the bars that had a more challenging scent really came alive in the shower. This however was not the case as it went from spicy cucumber to smelling like old hot dog water to me when in use. It would have been ranked much lower if the grit wasn't as good as it was. The rhyolite did end up scratching me at one point though turning my body into what looked like a victim of an angry cat. Might have been a sharper than normal rock inside.

Stark Cleanse - Another pleasing scent. Hard to describe as it's one of those sweet yet masculine scents you might find in modern day perfumery. If I had to describe it, maybe a bit like a berry with a slight metallic note. Unfortunately, I got a bit tired of the scent before I got through the bar. No grit as well. I will say though it was the only bar I used that never broke apart.

Cold Brew Clease - A great feeling bar on the skin with the coffee grounds that doesn't really leave a mess in the shower like others might say. That however is the only thing it has going for it. The scent is a decent coffee scent, but it's so very weak. You will really struggle hard to be able to smell this one, especially as it ages if not used right away.

Thousand Sword Scrub - Another bar I didn't quite like smelling in the box. It reminded me of the smell of pages in a new paperback book. In the shower though I loved using it. The scent somehow just works for me. The grit was the perfect level as well. Probably the least talked about bar in the Game of Thrones lineup. I wish I had another. Lingered on the skin as well after use.

Dark Side Scrub - I enjoyed this scent quite a bit in the box. It smelled to me like a smokey berry. I so looked forward to using it but once I had it in the shower, the scent disappeared almost completely. What a let down. Despite being a heavy grit mine was basically zero. My bar was mostly pink with very little back in it so that might have been why it lacked grit if the grit was in the black part.

Gold Moss - Really an underrated bar. A great masculine, woodsy scent. It became more potent in the shower than in the box. Lingered on the skin. I enjoyed using this one the whole way through. If it had grit it would have been A Tier.

Lather of the Loyal - A polarizing scent that from what I've read most people hate. I enjoyed the contrast of this one from the other bars. Extremely sweet, like a buttery caramel. Not for everyone. The grit was also spot on for me, comparing with Rainforest Rapids and Thousand Sword Scrub for best feeling bar. The oatmeal flakes could sometimes feel a bit pokey though.

Count Sudsula - Amazing scent. Probably one of the best from squatch. I describe it as a fruity yet masculine scent. If this were a fragrance I could spray on I would buy it. The grit is light, not the best feeling bar I've used but glad it wasn't zero grit. Lasted on skin as well as left a pleasant aroma in the bathroom. Stained the shower a bit red but very easy to get off, unlike the Pine Tar.

Eucalyptus Greek Yogurt - If you like eucalyptus/tea tree oil, you'll like this one. A pretty straight forward scent. Zero grit despite being labeled medium. I can see why it was discontinued as it's not the most exciting bar. I still enjoyed it though as I like tea tree oil. Not super potent.

Hot Choccy - Another let down. Initially having a moderate scent, it died down heavily as it aged. It smelled of the hot chocolate powder you'd find in a tin. The chocolate became less sweet and more bitter in the shower. The bar was less than 2 years old so I felt it should have kept it's scent longer as I was saving it for Christmas time. The grit was alright, leaning more light than medium as stated.

Seeing some of the posts on here, and the way people handle relationships, make me so fucking angry.","Why do people spend their whole relationships through text? Does no one speak any more? Phone calls? Going for a coffee or a drink to sort out a problem or fight? 

If you fight your significant other over *text*, you are braindead. That is not how humans genuinely communicate. Texting is convenient for setting up a **REAL** meeting with a person, saying hello, getting a quick laugh... Arguing over text is a crutch people use when they don't know how to face their problems.

If I was angry with someone I loved, I wouldn't hide behind faceless humane-less, text on a screen. I would sort it out face to face, or at very least on the phone.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1q1qpd5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1q1qpd5/the_potato_miracle/,The potato miracle,"So I’ve been struggling with digestive issues for 2-3 years now, never able to find out what they were until recently and I hope this helps others. 

I had random pains that would move around my stomach, intestinal area, sometimes sharp sometimes dull, and I suffered anxiety and depression (which I didn’t realize were related) 

I also had issues with diarrhea very often. 

After searching through ChatGPT and Gemini…

 (right now Gemini is better scientifically as long as you say “hypothetically speaking” to start, otherwise it won’t give medical advice) 

…It started mentioning something I hadn’t heard of before: SIBO - small intestinal bacteria overgrowth. 

Which apparently happens when your stomach isn’t strong enough and it causes slow digestion which allows bacteria or Archea (we have them in our bodies too - animals that can even live in volcanoes!)  that should be in the large intestine but they migrate up to the small intestine and cause issues. 

It’s a 3 hour test btw where you have to drink some sweet formula and then breathe into a bag every 15 mins. If you have elevated hydrogen you have SIBO if you have elevated methane, you have IMO (or methane predominant SIBO) 

Anyway. In a battle to try and rid myself of them, I accidentally messed up my gut flora, causing even more issues and eventually causing what I can guesstimate is gastritis gastro-paralysis (essentially nothing moving). 

For days I couldn’t eat, had gas, had a swollen sore tongue  with blisters - have acid reflux too. 

So I cut out coffee. Blisters reduced < LOvE coffee but my stomach just cannot handle it. 

Then I’ve been trying to find something to eat which wouldn’t make me feel terrible, bloated, or nauseas. 

The one thing I found with help from Gemini.

Mashed potatoes, beef broth and pepper. 

Boiled mashed potatoes (no milk just water) with a spoon of bone broth, some cracked pepper and a little salt.

Plus!! Drinking the potatoe water you boiled them in with a pinch of salt. Weird flavor yes but apparently potatoes and their water had a bunch of potassium, vitamin c, protein, and with the bone broth is also has amino acids. 

The whole thing is super easy to digest and as soon as I started eating it I just immediately felt better. Less panicky, less exhausted. I’m going to keep trying but so far, it feels like a real turning point. 

Still gassy, still don’t really get hungry. But apparently you can live ok on potatoes, bone broth and I also do a bit of greens powder in water in the morning. 

The one warning I’d provide is it also seems like I have a histamine sensitivity (red dots all over my forehead) and bone broth does have histamines. So it’s up to you to add it or not, I personally think it’s good because it provides a good pack of proteins (9 grams of protein for every 10 grams of dried broth) and it has the amino acids. 

So I still need to find a way to reduce my histamine load, but overall I’m feeling much better for anyone out there in need of something, try this. ",2,1767333197.0,Gastritis,1,1.0,False

I myself dont have bipolar anything nor have really been around anyone who had bipolar. But I need advice or suggestions where possible because Im just lost on what to do honestly. 

My fiance (21M) and I (23 F) have been together for 5 years. And I love him dearly. But his ups and downs from being manic are also now becoming my ups and downs in a way. My ultimate question is what is a reasonable way to react without making his manic worse? I want to be there for him in the best way possible, but I dont want to be hurt along the way where possible. 

I dont even know if im allowed to talk about his condition but he is non medicated (he doesnt want to be so I will never force it) he self medicatesn with greenery if that makes sense. Which in general does help. But nothing is 100%. So he flops between a frw different sides I would describe in vagueness as happy, boredom, aggressive, and rarely (to my knowledge) depressive. 

Happy- is the general good feelings, happy times, wanting to engage, be productive, and smiles.

Boredom- I feel like this is also in tie with ADHD where even if he has a billion things to do (videogames, cards, art stuff, etc) he just puts his head on his desk covers himself in a blanket, and doom scrolls (not even watching the videos just infinity scrolls). And has almost no desire to do anything.

Aggressive- hes overly critical, everything he says is right and if you prove him wrong youre an azz for doing so. (Noted this is almost always as he 1st wakes up before coffee and that morning routine very rarely any other time). 

Depressive- he just lays in bed, and in general doesnt respond, doesnt want to get up and doesnt touch his phone really or anything.

I am completely understanding thay you cant control the manic episodes and what they decide to be. I just want to find a way to react that doesnt make me an azzhole, because sometimes he gets aggressive because he thinks im upset with him (whether I am or not is irrelevant im just trying to mend the issue where possible). But its like everytime I want to help I contradict and make it worse. I just want to make it easier to manage without getting myself hurt because he gets critical with me.

At Thanksgiving Dinner, I was taking a picture of the over-priced gazebo my in-laws recently built to send to my friend with an eye-roll emoji, and guess what my iPhone immortalized in digital format? 

My husband was ki-ssing Diana. Talk about things not to be thankful for.

I let out a dry laugh, which burned my insides. It hurt like a motherfu-cker.

Then I printed ten photographs of the ki-ss and put them into the envelope.

I picked up the red and green acrylic pens I'd set aside for just this purpose and, with the viciousness of a woman scorned, wrote my husband's name and mine on it. 

To Aiden. From Mia. 

Then I contacted my friend, a divorce lawyer.

Heartbreak changes you—I would've never known, would never have believed it until it happened to me.

I'm not mercenary by nature. But I've been pushed to a point where I'm going to choose me, since my husband, the love of my life, doesn't give a rat's a-ss about me. 

Now he could choke on it.

——————

Mia

My last name might be Winter, but Aiden Winter and his parents, his sister, his brother, his...well, all his family, look at me and treat me like I'm just taking up space, the same exact space they'd rather fill with their favorite family friend—a woman who is probably fertile, considering I am not.

I'd have never asked for a divorce, no matter how bad things got, except....

I love my husband. I thought I knew he loved me.

But that changed when I saw him ki-ss another woman.

Oh, he backed away immediately, had a whole, 'what have I done' look on his face, but the genie was out of the fu-cking bottle.

""So, this is what it takes?"" my best friend asks, as she gives me a measured look.

Katya isn't a fan of Aiden or his family. She sees them as snobs who think that if your bank account doesn't have a zillion zeroes, then you aren't worthy of their time. She also sees Aiden as their enabler.

""They'd invite Ted Bundy over and treat him better than they do you if he came from money,"" she once quipped.

""Not just money,"" I corrected her, slurring my words because we'd finished a whole bottle of wine between us, ""it has to be old money.""

""You sure this is how you want to do this?"" she asks me, again, as she slides the divorce papers into a manila envelope.

We're sitting at her dining table in her cute cottage just outside of Burlington. It has three bedrooms. I'll be residing in one of them shortly, right after Christmas.

Katya and I grew up together.

When my parents died in an accident, her parents took me in. I was sixteen. I miss my parents every day, but Anya and Ivan made me their daughter in every way. So, Katya, in fact, is both my sister and best friend.

Losing Ivan three years ago was harder than when I lost my parents.

Anya now lives in an a-ssisted living facility, a couple of hours from Burlington. Katya tried taking care of her, but early-onset dementia isn't something that can be managed at home.

It's progressive and heartbreaking.

Sometimes, Anya is lucid, but most of the time, she isn't.

Katya and I mourn the woman she was before the disease took over—and try to be grateful that she's still with us, that there are moments where she knows us, when she reaches for Katya or me, and remembers our names. And then it's gone, like the tide pulling back before we can even feel the wave.

Katya and I used to visit Anya once a week, though now she mostly goes on her own. I have not been able to accompany her regularly. She understands that I have social responsibilities since I'm a Winter.

I can still hear Aiden say, ""She's not even your mother. I don't understand why you have to go. This charity lunch is important to my parents, Mia.""

I didn't argue. I stayed back.

I was weak and pathetic, so afraid to lose him that I just let go of myself.

No more!

""Yes, I'm sure. But use this."" I pull out an envelope from my tote. It's gorgeous and golden—one Aiden gave me two Christmases ago with a card in, a card that simply said: 'Paris Vacation'.

We still haven't gone.

My husband is the CEO of Winter Financial, a hedge fund company that manages gazillions of dollars. His father, Nelson, is Chairman of the Board. He's a piece of work, by which I mean a complete misogynist and a-sshole.

""The one thing you should be able to do, which is get knocked up, and you can't do that. Why the fu-ck is he still married to you?"" he once said to me.

I'd then said it was because he loved me.

What the fu-ck did I know?

I'm a kindergarten teacher; I don't usually swear. But since that ki-ss, something has been unraveling inside of me.

""Oh, and don't forget to add this."" I hand her ten printed photographs of the ki-ss. For each print, I used a different filter. The noir one looks particularly romantic.

Yes, I took a photo.

No, it wasn't intentional.

It was by accident.

I'd needed to breathe, so I had left the family house while pie was being served at Thanksgiving Dinner.

I was taking a picture of the over-priced gazebo my in-laws recently built to send to Katya with an eye-roll emoji, and guess what my iPhone immortalized in digital format?

Yep, you guessed it!

My husband was ki-ssing her.

Talk about things not to be thankful for.

Katya snickers. ""This is truly diabolical. I never thought you'd do it.""

""I never did, either,"" I admit.

Her expression softens with compa-ssion. ""How hard is this?""

I let out a dry laugh, which burns my insides. ""It hurts like a motherfu-cker.""

""You keep up with that language, and they'll kick you out of Little Luminaries,"" she teases, but her voice is gentle. She knows how much I love Aiden. Knows that this is painful. Knows that I feel lost and afraid.

""Then you can hire me at your firm.""

Katya is a divorce lawyer. And right now, it is conveniently handy.

Every woman whose husband cheats on her should have a divorce lawyer as a best friend.

""And you're sure you don't want to talk to him and get his side of the story?"" She gives me the sealed envelope.

""He ki-ssed her. That's the end of the story, babe.""

I pick up the red and green acrylic pens I'd set aside for just this purpose and, with the viciousness of a woman scorned, write my husband's name and mine on it.

To Aiden. From Mia.

I add some sketches of holly and sh-it—so it looks Christma-ssy.

""Mia, I am so sorry."" Katya puts a hand on my shoulder.

I hold her gaze, my eyes dry. I'd cried myself dry for three weeks now, and I didn't have anything left.

""I'm not.""

She tilts her head and gives me a look that says, ""I don't believe you, babe. But A+ for faking it.""

I shake my head as I set the acrylic pens on Katya's desk. ""I've put up with enough.""

""I know that.""

""Years of doing everything I can to make his family accept me, make him happy, and what do I get in return? I get to photograph him ki-ssing Diana fu-cking Valentine.""

""I've never heard you cuss this much,"" Katya notes.

""Well, Miss Goody Two-Shoes is done being good.""

Heartbreak changes you—I would've never known, would never have believed it until it happened to me.

I take a cleansing breath. ""Now, let's walk through that blasted prenuptial agreement.""

I'm not mercenary by nature. But I've been pushed to a point where I'm going to choose me, since my husband, the love of my life, doesn't give a rat's a-ss about me.

And, let's face it, the Winters have it coming. After all, they were the ones who'd put the infidelity clause in that prenup; certain a harlot like me would be the one who'd stray.

Now they can choke on it.

As the heroine in William Congreve's 1697 play, The Mourning Bride, declared, ""Heaven has no rage like love to hatred turned, nor he-ll a fury like a woman scorned.""

Aiden

""Baby, you haven't eaten anything.""

I looked at Mia's plate, barely touched. She'd cooked dinner like she always does—fish and rice, and vegetables.

She opened a bottle of dry Riesling to go with it. She'd drunk two gla-sses. One more than usual.

She looks small, lost, and guilt swarms through me.

That ki-ss!

God! How could I have done that to my marriage? To myself?

The only saving grace is that it was one ki-ss, and Mia didn't know. I can't stand the idea of her finding out. She'll break.

My wife loves me. Completely.

My family doesn't see it.

""Not hungry,"" she says, her eyes staring into the distance.

""You packed?"" I ask because she's not looking at me, and I'm trying to extend the conversation so she will.

Now, she does. But there's a faraway look on her face. I've never seen it before. She seems detached. ""I packed.""

We leave for Stowe, Vermont, tomorrow for the Winter Christmas week, as we always do.

Bliss—the estate that has been in the Winter family for several generations—is a forty-minute drive from Burlington. There are several cabins around the estate and one large house, my parents', where we stay and spend most of our time during this week, eating, drinking, and being a family.

""Skis?"" I ask.

""Of course.""

I nod and press my lips. ""Are you alright?""

""Why wouldn't I be?"" She looks confused enough that I wonder if I'm transferring my guilt onto her.

I feel like sh-it.

Diana and I grew up together.

Her parents were close friends of mine. When they pa-ssed when we were in our twenties, we enfolded her into our family. She got married and lived in Los Angeles, but after her divorce, she returned and has become a fixture.

She's close to my sister and sister-in-law. She goes on spa days with my mother. My father adores her. She works at Winter Financial as the Chief Financial Officer. We spend a lot of time together at work.

My colleagues joke and call her my 'work wife'.

When I ask my a-ssistant to let my wife know I'll be late, she teases and asks me which one. It's usually Mia who has to hear from my a-ssistant.

I don't love Diana. Not like I love Mia. However, over the past two years, since Diana returned to Vermont and started working for me, I have been to more restaurants with Diana and had more meals with her than with my wife.

""Be careful,"" Huxley, my oldest and closest friend, warned me when we met a few months ago for drinks.

He owns a chain of hotels across the state. We met in high school and have been close since.

""What do you mean?"" I asked, perturbed.

""You're planning a business trip and missing your wedding anniversary.""

""And?""

""And...you're taking a business trip with Diana to Paris.""

I shook my head. ""What the fu-ck are you trying to say?""

""I'm not trying, Aiden, I'm telling you that you're having a fu-cking affair and you're going to lose your wife over it.""

I laughed. Hard. ""I'm not having an affair. Diana is family, Hux. We're colleagues and⁠—""

""You're having an emotional affair. Your colleagues call her your work wife.""

I waved a dismissive hand. ""Everyone has a work wife. Means nothing.""

""How does Mia feel about her?""

""My wife isn't insecure,"" I snapped.

""She's not happy about all the time you spend with Diana. I can guarantee that, even if she hasn't said a thing.""

It's not like she hadn't, but she understands that work is work, and Diana is family. She brought it up a lot when Diana first moved back to Vermont, but I shut it down by telling her to grow a spine and trust me.

""You don't know Mia, so stop pretending like you do.""

""But I know Diana,"" he pointed out. He did. We all grew up together. ""She wants to be your wife.""

""But I don't want her. Not like that. Never like that.""

He gave me a measured look. ""You sure about that?""

I lied to him then and said I was.

But the truth?

I enjoy Diana's company.

She looks up to me and talks to me like I'm some kind of financial genius. It soothes my ego.

Mia is a kindergarten teacher. She knows nothing about high finance. I love her. But for a while there, she didn't excite me.

Even remembering how I felt makes me feel guilty, especially now, after that da-mned ki-ss.

Especially now that I realize I confused new and shiny with excitement, which made me ignore my wife, maybe even resent her a little.

I can't believe I let it happen. Let another woman ki-ss me. Place her lips on mine. Be intimate with me.

It was after Thanksgiving Dinner.

Diana says she wants to talk about work. We go outside in the snow and walk to the gazebo. My mother just had it built.

It comes with a gla-ss cover.

It's pleasant, even on a frigid day.

""Aiden, I want to ask you something."" She looks nervous. I give her a rea-ssuring look.

""Anything, Di.""

She smiles, licks her lips. ""I...don't...."" She trails off, shaking her head. ""I...never mind.""

""Sweetheart, what's up?""

She looks at me with moist eyes, and my heart pounds in my chest. Something is wrong, and I want to fix it. I don't like seeing Diana upset.

""Are you happy in your marriage?"" Her words are a whisper.

I frown. ""What?""

""Are you?""

""Yes...I think so.""

She puts a hand on my chest. ""We spend a lot of time together, Aiden. I can feel it, too.""

I look at her painted nails, Fire Engine Red, against the white of my dress shirt. I raise my eyes to hers. ""Feel what?""

""Us.""

She steps closer. Goes on tiptoe and...places her lips against mine.

It's a shock.

My mouth opens without me thinking about it. Her tongue touches mine.

For a moment, we stay locked.

Then, an eternity later, reality slams into me. I step back, away from her, away from the man I don't want to be.

""What the he-ll, Diana?"" I snap, furiously swiping my mouth with the back of my hand, as if I can scrub away the taint she's just put on my marriage.

Whatever flicker of attraction I once felt for her—something I can admit now—vanishes in an instant, burned out by anger and disgust.

She's exciting. Interesting. Understands my work. Is beautiful as fu-ck.

But she isn't Mia.

She isn't soft, warm, and gentle. She doesn't make me laugh with stories about her students. She doesn't make sure that I have my migraine pills with me, because she can see, even before I can, that it's coming. She doesn't hold my hand when my father makes me feel small. She doesn't do any of that.

I love my wife.

I'm happy in my marriage.

What the fu-ck have I done?

""I know,"" she breathes. Steps closer.

I hold a hand up to stop her, to keep her away from me. ""Know what?""

""That you're not happy in your marriage.""

""What the fu-ck are you talking about?""

My entire being is horrified at what just happened.

I ki-ssed another woman. I couldn't wrap my head around it. Since I met Mia, there has been no one else. Not even in fantasy. Even when I masturbate, it's to her.

""I know you want a child.""

I freeze.

Her words slice through me like a sharp, merciless blade.

I told Diana recently—something that isn't a secret in the family—that Mia can't have children. Endometriosis stole that from her. She wants to adopt, and God, I wish I could give her that without hesitation. But my parents are dead set against it, and the truth is, so am I.

I know exactly how they'll treat an adopted grandchild—like they're less than—and I can't bear the thought of bringing a child into that. So, I said no. And every time I think about it, I feel like I've failed Mia twice over.

""And?""

""I can give you a baby, Aiden. She can't.""

I shake my head as if that's going to help clear this mess I made.

""She's my wife, Diana. I love her.""

She scoffs at that. Her blue eyes blaze with irritation. ""Do you? You spend more time with me than with her, even on weekends. You have more dinners with me. You have more breakfasts with me than you do with her.""

""That's work, Diana."" But I'm lying. It was not always the case. I know it. She does, too.

""You missed your wedding anniversary to be with me in Paris.""

""We had a client meeting,"" I protest.

""You took me out to dinner on your wedding anniversary. A romantic dinner at the Eiffel Tower,"" she reminds me.

""That was...that was just because you said you wanted to eat at the Eiffel Tower.""

Why did I do that? Why did I miss my wedding anniversary and take this woman, who isn't my wife, anywhere?

I clench my jaw. ""It appears I have given you some signals that I didn't intend. I love my wife. I don't care that she can't have children. I'm not interested in you...se-xually. What you just pulled, Diana?"" I let out a huff of breath. ""Don't ever do something like that again.""

Three weeks have gone by since Thanksgiving, and that ki-ss weighs like a ton of bricks inside of me.

At work, I've cut my interactions with Diana down to the bare minimum. No more casual chats, no more small talk. If I speak to her, it's strictly business—and whenever possible, I make sure there's a chaperone in the room. Sometimes two.

She's not taking it well.

""I know you're feeling guilty, but if a marriage is not working, it's not,"" she tells me after my first week of keeping her at an arm's length. ""I know from experience. You're a good man. You don't want to hurt Mia. But staying with her when it's not right will end up hurting you both in the long run.""

I ki-ssed another woman. I'm definitely not a good man.

However, that ki-ss made one thing crystal clear—I don't want Diana.

She might have been a stimulating mind to spar with about Winter Financial, but that's all she ever was: a colleague, not a partner. She was never someone I could be with emotionally. She's been a decent sounding board for the CEO in me, but never for the man I am. The man I am needs Mia. Loves Mia. Without her, my days would turn black.

""Don't talk to me about this bullsh-it again,"" I retort. ""If you do, I swear to God, Diana, you'll be looking for a new job.""

She went straight to my father, who told me to man up and take what I want. In the past week, my mother has told me that maybe it's time to let Mia go. My sister, Gianna, has also shared her thoughts on the matter, as has my brother, Tristan.

My family's never liked Mia—never thought she was right for me. And when they found out we couldn't have kids, that pushed them right over the edge.

But my wife? he-ll, she's a saint. She still tries with them. Still smiles. Still offers kindness they don't deserve. Still holds her patience, even when I know every word from them is designed to cut.

And what do you do, Aiden?

You let her work hard for their approval and never tell them to accept your wife for who she is.

Why the he-ll else would they think you'd be interested in leaving her?

Since that ki-ss, I've spent more time in introspection than my whole life put together. I can see I've been a terrible husband to the best wife a man can have.

Mia's love is clean. Pure.

She has no one. Like Diana. No siblings, no parents. Her friend Katya's family is hers, just like the Winters are Diana's. But the similarities end there. Diana is entitled. I can see that now. Mia is absolutely not. Diana is polished but also a little fake. Mia is genuine. And most importantly, there isn't a situation, not even with a gun to her head, where Mia would make a pa-ss at a married man.

""I'm going to bed,"" Mia announces, bringing me back to our dining room, to our marriage that I know is fraying at the edges. She looks at the table and the dishes in the kitchen and sighs. ""I'll take care of it tomorrow.""

The hits keep coming.

She cooks and cleans.

After dinner, I usually go into my home office and spend a couple of hours there. I've always worked long hours. But since I took over as CEO after my father stepped down a couple of years ago, around the time Diana joined Winter Financial, I've been busier than ever.

Mia says she understands but implores me to pursue balance. ""Can't work all the time, Aiden. You have to make room for play, to relax, to even get bored.""

""I'll clean up, baby."" I smile at her.

There's a flare of surprise in her eyes.

That's the kind of sh-itty husband I am that my wife is shocked I volunteered to help her with a household chore.

She shrugs. ""You don't have to.""

She doesn't wait to see if I agree with her or not. She just leaves.

I know something is very wrong. I can feel it.

My premonition proves correct.

Mia

I lie in bed and stare at the ceiling.

My heart hurts.

My Aiden ki-ssed another woman.

My Aiden doesn't love me.

My Aiden is not mine.

We met eight years ago. I was so young. Just twenty-two, studying to become a kindergarten teacher. He was thirty, having already completed the educational part of his life, and was working at his family's business.

I had no money. He had too much.

I had no family. He had everyone, even grandparents.

Nothing much has changed, has it? I still have no money. I still have no family.

We live in a very nice home in Burlington, Vermont, one we bought together. With his money, obviously. But he always said everything he had was mine. It was our money.

It felt like a dream. Like I'd won the lottery, not the financial kind but the kind of love I thought only happened in movies.

The first time he saw me, I was shelving books in the children's section of the bookstore where I worked part-time. He walked in, tall and polished in a charcoal-gray coat, lost in the stacks like he didn't belong among the tiny tables and mismatched rugs.

I asked if I could help him. He wanted to buy a book as a Christmas present for his two-year-old nephew. I recommended Corduroy.

He thanked me. Said I had beautiful eyes.

He kept coming back.

Every Friday at 4 p.m., like clockwork, he would buy another book for his nephew.

When he finally asked me to dinner, I said no the first time. And the second.

I knew who he was. In Burlington, everyone knew the Winter family. They were wealthy beyond belief.

He kept asking, especially when I told him that he was not in my league. He said he loved that about me, that I wasn't like the women he knew. That I saw him, not his bank account.

He made me feel special.

Chosen.

That's the part that hurts the most now.

Because when he ki-ssed her, Diana Valentine, he un-chose me.

After all these years of loyalty—of swallowing my pride and putting up with his family because he loves them—even though they treat me like dirt ground into their custom Persian rugs...he still discarded me.

All the times I smiled through his mother's digs about my wardrobe being 'too schoolteacher-like', sat through dinner parties where she practically introduced me as Aiden's charity case, swallowed his father calling me barren, endured his sister's little jabs—like saying I probably couldn't even spell ""fiduciary""—and his brother and sister-in-law's constant reminders that we were childless because my body had failed Aiden....

And what do I have to show for it?

Nothing.

No—that's not true. I have a broken heart to match my broken uterus.

It wasn't like this all the time. I wonder how many women, who see their marriage disintegrate, say that.

Before Aiden took over as CEO, he would wake up before me, make me coffee, and we'd drink it together while we ate breakfast. He was always home for dinner. He sent me text messages all day.

Even after the doctors said I had endometriosis, which had made me infertile, he never made me feel bad about it. When I suggested we should adopt, he told me that would be a bad idea, considering his parents would have a problem with it. We talked about surrogacy. We talked about a lot of things regarding having children—not once did he tell me that he resented me for us not being able to have children.

All that changed when he became the CEO and Diana returned to Burlington.

It started slowly, the way these things usually do.

A missed dinner—followed by an apology.

A missed birthday—followed by flowers and an apology.

A missed wedding anniversary—followed by a gift, flowers, and an apology.

And then he started missing more and more...and stopped apologizing.

Just a casual, ""You understand, don't you, baby? It's so busy.""

As if I didn't even deserve an explanation.

I took it. I swallowed my hurt. I wanted to be supportive. I wanted to be a good wife.

I wanted to—God help me—keep him.

Tears fill my eyes.

I was afraid of losing him.

That's the reason I let his family abuse me.

Let him disrespect me by spending more and more time with another woman.

I allowed this to happen.

I was so busy being a good wife, I didn't realize that I was compensating for him being a sh-it husband.

I mean, who takes his work wife (yeah, I know what they call Diana) to Paris on his wedding anniversary? An a-sshole does. A man who isn't worthy of being called husband.

I let my need for a family take precedence over my need to be seen. I kept shrinking, kept smiling, kept hoping and praying that Aiden wouldn't leave me.

And now?

Now, I'm lying in a bed we picked out together, in a house I helped turn into a home, wondering how long I've been disappearing—little pieces at a time.

I turn my head to look at his side of the bed. It's empty. Devoid.

Deciding to leave him has resulted in heartache, absolutely.

But surprisingly, there is also peace.

I no longer have to live in fear that he's going to abandon me, because that already happened. I don't have to be terrified of him asking me for a divorce, because that's happening. I don't have to be petrified of the idea that he's going to choose another, better woman, because...he's done that, too.

All my nightmares have come true, so I don't have to fear them anymore.

I lay a hand on the cold pillow.

Is he working in his office downstairs, or is he mourning the version of us that I'm still fighting to remember?

My eyes fall on the photo on his nightstand. It's his favorite. At least that's the bullsh-it he sold me.

It's when we got engaged. It's candid.

The bookstore manager took it. That's where he proposed to me, where we first met. Aiden had told her he was planning on proposing to me, so she was ready for it.

I'm laughing while he ki-sses my lips.

The ring is beautiful.

My eyes are filled with happiness.

His smile is wide.

We look like a couple who'll make it.

I look away from it, draw my hand back from the unoccupied pillow, and rest my chin on the fist I curl beneath it as I turn my back to his side of the bed.

I don't cry.

I've cried enough.

I have pain, yes. But I also have a plan.

I have the divorce papers. I am going to reclaim my dignity. I'm not going to be a doormat any longer. I'm going to be someone I can be proud of.

But...the ache in my chest tells me one thing⁠—

No matter how broken he's made me feel, I still love him.

And that might be the cruelest betrayal of all.

When the bedroom door opens, I close my eyes, pretending to be asleep.

I've never done this.

I waited for him, cuddled with him, and talked to him. And, now I realize, forced him to pay attention to me.

I hear the gentle click of the handle, the faint shuffle of his bare feet on the carpet.

Aiden. He moves quietly, like he thinks I might be asleep. Or maybe he's hoping I am?

He goes into the bathroom. I hear the sounds of the shower, the toothbrush, of Aiden—familiar sounds, routine, intimate.

Will I miss this in two nights?

Those are the number of nights we have left together.

Tonight.

Tomorrow night.

And then it's Christmas Eve, when we'll open presents after dinner, as is the Winter tradition. The kids get their presents before dinner so they can be put to bed right after they finish eating—shuttled off with nannies who don't get Christmas off.

That's when I will end this.

Aiden slips under the covers beside me, his body warm and familiar, and somehow, because of that ki-ss I saw him sharing with Diana, cold and strange.

I used to turn toward him, automatically. My cheek would find his chest, his arm would wrap around my waist. I'd exhale like I'd come home.

I don't move now. I lie there, tense, facing away.

A moment pa-sses. Two.

Then his hand rests lightly on my hip.

""Mia,"" he murmurs, voice low. He shifts closer, his body curling around mine.

His fingers brush the bare skin at my waist, under the edge of my sleep shirt.

His mouth finds the curve of my neck, presses a ki-ss there. Soft. Tentative.

I feel nothing. No spark. No flutter. Just a rising wave of cold.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Would I buy it again? Short answer is YES! It does the job and it does it very well, it is a workhorse. Here are my honest, unbiased key points about the grinder in no particular order not stated as pros and cons - I wish I had known these; it had taken me some time to understand and do the best with them. 

1. I hate the original cup holder - you can’t dose directly to a portafilter with a cone. The grinder does a great job at spitting out fluffy coffee that just needs to be properly distributed around the portafilter, minimizing the WDT work. There is absolute no need to dose into the cup and then transfer to the portafilter. Even the raiser for the cup - WTF? If you can’t fit the portafilter then why add that insert to bring the cup closer to the chute? Shouldn’t the original cup holder have that design? I had a printed thing from wholelattelove that allows me to dose directly to the portafilter and works like a charm. 

2. Stock burrs are great - I really the original stock burrs are underrated. They are fantastic. No need to upgrade, IMO. Pourover and espresso work well. Yeah, can you get a little more clarity of the flavours if you change to SSP UF, and if pourover is your only thing; yeah worth it, but if you are doing espresso, overrated. 

3. Burr alignment - either they were not perfect from the getgo or they got misaligned over time (which I doubt). They were not horrible either. Aligning the burrs is easy. You just need a bit of patience. I did it and to be honest, I don’t think it made any difference. IMO, people make a bigger fuzz about this than what is warranted. 

4. The arrow for the grind setting is actually good - In the beginning I hated it because it felt flimsy as it could be easily moved (I moved it accidentally a couple of times). Once I got the hang of the grinder and understood burr alignment, I actully thought it was clever to allow for manual adjustment of the set point. Works great. My only complaint is that I had to do a search to map the settings to microns to get closer to a decent grind for new beans in the first try. 

5. I hate the bellow - I don’t like blowing air to clean up (see next point). Also, it is just sitting on top and can be knocked down easily. I wish it had a cone or something along these lines. 

4. It is a messy grinder - no matter what you do (including spraying the beans), there is coffee everywhere. Static always builds and makes the coffee behave erratically. Also, inevitably, coffee is retained in the chute; even if it is minimal. If you use the bellow, well, don’t have to be a genius to figure out that it will fly out of control. If you use the provided brush, well you’ll see. I ended up buying a hand vac (fanttick) to clean up the flying dust and be able to still have a relationship with my significant other. 

5. It really does not retain coffee - yeah dust accumulates, but what you put in, you get out with +- 0.2g 

6. It is a workhorse - it never stops, chirps, complains. Whatever you put it, will come out. I think it has a great motor and itwill be very durable. 

I think this is it. At the end of the day it is just a grinder and a good one. For the amount of money paid, I still think it is probably one of the best buys out there. Hard to compete with the value proposition of this grinder. ",6,1767333073.0,DF64,1,1.0,False

I already made and posted this story to nosleep, but i hate the rules there, so why not post it here too? I think both members of Creepcast would like it, as it fits into the typical early-creepypasta stories. Anyways, getting that out of the way, here's a repost of my story. (PS. This is my first time actually writing a horror story, so i really apologize if there's writing errors or gramatical fuck-ups, but i'm probably going to rewrite this as soon as i get a better understanding of posting. I also wrote this from a first person perspective for nosleep, but i'm too lazy to rewrite it in a different perspective so here you go.)

 ! CW for violence and depictions of a dead animal

Beginning: Eddie the Eye Eater

 I didn't think i'd ever end up here, explaining my story like this after everything. But i guess life has weird ways of making you confess, huh? 

Part 1: Jack

It was sometime in November probably, i can't remember the exact day, but i do know it was cold as hell. I was in bed, panting and exhausted from earlier activity's in the day, work, and on top of all that, i got early collage-course classes for the semester. My boyfriend had already left, piece of shit that he is, and i was alone for the rest of the night. The window was open -his half-assed excuse to get some fresh air before he left, when really i could tell he was trying to stare at some girl's ass from across campus- and i hadn't bothered closing it.

Just as i was about to get up, feed my cat it's second meal of the day, i almost jumped out of my skin when hearing a tap on the glass. Whipping around to see what the noise was, can-opener in hand, i relaxed with a long sigh. Just the cat, Jack, scratching at glass from his sitting spot on the windowsill. ""Damnit, Jack, you're killing me here."" I scolded my four-month old kitten softly, but i really couldn't make myself too mad at him. Who could be upset over such an innocent creature, anyway? I threw my long, dark brown hair over my shoulder, walking over and picking up the small feline to put near his food, and went back to bed.

In the middle of the night, i heard a scream. In my exhausted, drowsy state, i could barely make out what it sounded like- definitely not human, but.. Well, i was never the girl to be into supernatural shit, anyways. It kinda sounded wild, like a feral animal or something. In a state of bitter amusement, i drifted back to sleep thinking it was just another collage girl in the dorms, living it up with some guy who could make her scream. Good for her, the lucky bitch.

In the morning though, my assumption was proved wrong. So, so horribly wrong. How could it have come to this? I stumbled out of bed, my head tilted back as the refreshing eyedrops hit my pupils, before i stopped dead in my tracks. That scream wasn't from a human, like i thought.

Jack, cute-as-a-button and sweet as sugar, the most adorable and innocent kitten there was ever was, lay dead on my kitchen counter. Surprisingly his body was unharmed; no fur ruffled, no deep wounds, no guts spilling out. But as my eyes drifted upward, my mouth tasted like it was full of felt, my tongue feeling the same weight as a lead bullet. His face- my poor fur baby's face.. His eyes? Oh god- i felt sick, but i bit my tongue to draw blood instead, focusing on the pain rather then the guilt i felt bubbling for not just checking on the noise during the night. His eyes were missing, empty sockets full of dried blood, head laid sideways on the counter. Somehow he looked peaceful, despite myself knowing what utter, tortureous pain he must've been in.

After i emptied my stomach of yesterday's minimal food content, i reached for my phone with slightly-trembling hands, dialing both my boyfriend, Eric, and also my RA to explain the situation. I genuinely had no idea what or who could've done this to my cat, but i forced myself to face the facts: My cat had been killed last night, and whatever did it could kill me next. It had gotten into my apartment somehow- Who knew if it would come again? After a very-tired and almost annoyed sounding grumbled reassurance from Eric, he said he'd come over right away to help me cope. My RA -the only empathetic person in this damn collage- said through broken tears she would call someone who could clean up the deceased feline's body, and that my classes would be put on hold for now.

Part 2: Anatomy

Eric arrived after twenty minutes, carrying a coffee to keep me up and a jacket for me to wear as we walked to his dorm. I couldn't stand the sight of those people coming in, cleaning up my baby kitten's corpse off the counter. I hiccuped and sobbed when i overhead them murmuring, ""Fuck, whoever did this is sick in the head.."" And hid my face harshly into Eric's shoulder. He just sighed, patting my head and stroking my hair in that same unfazed way he always did.

Walking into his dorm was the same as ever- textbooks sprawled across the floor, messy takeout containers lining his dusty shelves, an AC unit that barely had enough heat for passing health code violations. It was his home though, and i accepted that. All things about Eric i accepted; even if he was a nonsensical idiot sometimes, and at other times a downright cheater. But i pushed past it, because as much as i hated to admit it- he was probably the best pick on campus. Plus, the saving grace about him was, despite everything, he was smart. Sure not in the typical way- no glasses to be pushed up on his face, no 'Erm, actuallys' to be said in his deep, monotone voice. He knew quite a bit about anatomy, specifically the functions and features of the human face. His hyper focus was now eyes- as i assumed by the multiple drawings he'd stuck up on the walls, detailing precise graphite lines of pencil strokes, naming every single vein, all the explanations of a cornea.

After flopping down on his couch, wiping away tears from my eyes and looking at him, i asked something in a softer tone the unusual. ""..Can you distract me? Just ramble on about your studies, i don't care."" Waving my hand at him i laid down, curling up with a pillow clutched close to my chest. Rolling his eyes, he complied with my request and sat down beside me, picking up a textbook off the floor and beginning to recite passages about random anatomy facts. My mind drifted away from Jack, successfully distracted by his quiet voice in the loudness of my thoughts.. And before i knew it, i was asleep.

When i woke up, it felt like days has passed- or maybe that was the situation coming back to me in full force. I then spent about a week off of classes, just hanging around Eric to take my mind off of things. I felt.. oddly okay? Sure, i cried myself to sleep some nights because of Jack, but who wouldn't? I convinced myself my unusual lack of grief was normal, and went on with my life.

Little did i know that, by seeing my dead cat, poor eyeless Jack, something in me had snapped. It hurt me so bad that, by some force of nature.. i felt nothing anymore.

Part 3: Obsession

It had been a full two months since Jack's death. Me and Eric had broke up, he went off dating that girl he had been checking out the night of my kitten's death, but i told myself it was fine. Who cared, anyways? Besides, i had been too busy thinking over more important things than Jack or Eric. Something had stuck in my head that day when he red me to sleep, the ways he described the little optic nerve connecting the eyes to the brain.. And paired with the fact Jack's empty sockets haunted my nightmares every night, it was safe to say i was obsessed. Not just with those specific instinces- but i was scrambling for any fact, information, or knowledge i could learn about eyes. I didn't know why i was so deep into this rabbit-hole, but there was no turning back now.

Part 4: Name Reveal

Months had passed by now. It was cold as i slipped into his dorm. Jesse, the girl laying beside him, was unconscious already. I glared hatred at the new girl, dragging her out of the bed with silent, clumsy but affective movements. Once in the kitchen, where the lighting was much better, i used my fore-finger and thumb to open her eyes, studying them with a flashlight. I had to bite back a groan of annoyance when i saw her irises- bloodshot and drunk. Fuck, those never worked as good. I shook off my lingering frustration, taking a melon-baller and making this quick, not wanting to waste precious time.

When Eric woke up, he walked into his kitchen to find me smiling tiredly, my nails painted a fresh shade of red while holding out a bowl of something with a mouth-watering scent. He raised an eyebrow, but i quickly put a hand up to silence him. My green eyes studied him in the light, intense but my intent unreadable. ""Hey, i know it's been a complicated few past months, but i wanted to come here and talk. Is that alright? Jess let me in after saying she was going home for the night.."" Skeptical but also exhausted, hungry and still drowsy from sleep, he walked over and sat down. I pushed the bowel toward him, murmuring soft encouragements while watching him take a spoon and taste the soup.

His eyes widened, swallowing thickly while staring into his bowl. From inside the murky brown stew, with vegetables and meat floating in it, he saw a singular eye pop up from the liquid. A bright blue iris stared back at him, the white part slightly red and veins popping out in contrast. He dropped his spoon to the floor, a loud clatter making his head throb but pushing past the pain to stare at me in rising horror. ""W-What the hell, Eddie?! Y-you- Oh my god-"" He cupped a hand over his mouth, struggling not to vomit from a mix of disgust and discomfort from his hangover.

I giggled, twirling the bloody melon-baller in my hands while looking at him. ""Why so scared, Eric? Don't tell me you never though she had pretty eyes\~"" He stumbled again, trying to run away from me but tripping on the messy clutter in the floor during the process. I approached him, grinning with an evil smile, kneeling down while pinning his neck with my forearm. I took something out of my pocket with the other hand- a bloody eyeball, blue iris and all. I tossed it in my mouth, crunching down on the object with a sickening pop. ""Just like eating a grape\~"" I mocked his horrified stare, putting the melon-baller near his face, tracing his jaw with the cold metal. ""Maybe if you beg, i might let you go.."" The words trailing out off my mouth, sentence running off as his eyes filled with desperate hope.

Perfect, i thought. Leaning forward, i suddenly smacked a hand over his face, pinning his neck still between my legs, sitting on his chest while wrenching the kitchen applience in his eye sockets. As the disgusting snapping of nerves echoed through the silent apartment, his pained screams drowning out my laughter, i felt a wave of nostalgia wash over me. The memory of Jack, eyeless and peaceful in death- I felt an uncontrollable rage wash over me, and i scrambled up from Eric to run to the kitchen. Grabbing a knife, i rushed back to his body and stabbed him over and over again, getting lost in the blood splattering across me. As the RA's blood-curdling scream came from the doorway, i only grinned manically at her and kept stabbing.

Part 5: Getting caught + Ending

I was sentenced to about 20 years for the death of the girlfriend, Jesse Pink, along with my late boyfriend Eric Carmin. I didn't bother getting a lawyer- Why would i need one, anyway? I was happy to rot in my cell, plotting my escape while fantasizing about the idea of tasting eyes once again. I would be sure to slip by undetected anyways, getting out of prison one way or another.

I have been attending AA meetings in my community for two weeks.  I have found a home group and this morning found my sponsor.

My sponsor is very articulate and has been sober for about 20 years.  He has the willingness to ask tough questions.  We’re a part of an underground men’s only meeting of AA members that occurs at 6pm on Sundays in a buddies garage, prior to a regular meeting.  That is where I was so impressed with him.

Today we met for coffee and he officially agreed to sponsor me.  I’d asked him to consider it via text a few days earlier.

So yeah, already I have been so impressed with the peer support that one finds in AA meetings.  It has been a strong start.  It might be unusual to find a home group and sponsor so soon… but we live in a small community and you just know when it is right.  In spite of being a small city AA meetings occur 5 days a week.

I wish I could share the picture, but tonight a member gave me a spirit stone…. A thrombolite agate found on the Queen Charlotte Islands…. It means a lot…..  more than the 2 month chip I will get at a meeting on Sunday.

Be well everyone….  One day at a time.",1,1767332688.0,alcoholicsanonymous,2,1.0,False

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

We were in a band together, and I ended up getting kicked out because I didn’t get along with my bandmates. I also didn’t see a future with them. Not long after that, I started dating our guitarist. While we were together, it hurt deeply every time he went to band practice. He said he didn’t want me to leave the band, but it felt inevitable—I was surrounded by five other guys, and it was too much for my mental health. Eventually, we broke up because everything felt overwhelming.

Fast forward two months: I’m now dating someone new, someone I really like. But the truth is, I never fully moved on from my ex. I thought about him and wished things could have worked out almost every day. I know he dated other people too. This past week, as my new relationship has started to feel more real, it’s also made it more real that my ex and I are truly over.

I’m in a new band now, and even though I miss my ex and our old band terribly, I also know I’m where I want—and need—to be. Still, I’m struggling. I haven’t been able to have sex with the person I’m dating. I’ve cried quietly about my ex while listening to music with him.

I am 36F and my husband is 38M

Honest opinions welcome from everyone. I don’t know if I am over exaggerating or if my feelings are valid here. We are currently going through a hard time juggling all of our responsibilities and would love to hear your thoughts

I sometimes feel like my husband and I have our “own domains” and we don’t do things together as much and with the kids.

We have two young kids (age 5 and age 3). My husband works a demanding job (his hours are usually 8 am to about 5:30 pm). sometimes he randomly has to log on in the evenings as well. He is fully remote though.

I have a demanding job too. I would say my job is more flexible as in I have a really good relationship with my boss and being a manager allows me to re juggle my day if things come up with the kids. I do have a hybrid role (I am in the office for 2 days a week but again flexible, so sometimes I only go in once a week)

Below is our routine and lately I feel like i am doing more of the share of the work and I feel resentment creeping in.

Monday to Friday routine

\- kids both wake up at 7 am

\- 3 out of the 5 days (the days i am not going into the office), my husband will get up and take them down to eat breakfast. The other 2 days, I do this.

\- On the 3 days he does, I sleep in/lounge in bed for like 15 minutes

\- on all 5 days, I pack my sons lunch in the morning for school

\- on the 3 days, my husband will drop my daughter to daycare and I will do the other 2 days and head to work. On the 3 days i am home, I will drop my son to school in the morning and on the other two days, my husband drops him.

\- my husband and I both work together to get the kids ready in the morning

\- during the day (on days im home), in between meetings and during my lunch, I will unload the dishwasher and load any dishes that are lying around in addition to vaacuming etc. we both take care of figuring out what we are eating for breakfast or lunch. However I noticed I always offer him lunch if I know whatever i’m making is double portion (i.e if i’m making a sandwich, I offer it to him too). He never does this same thing for me. even in the mornings, he makes his own coffee and never even offers to make me anything.

\- in terms of pick up in the evening, I pick my son up and he picks my daughter up. my sons pick up is a short walk from our house and for my daughter, he drives about 10 min to go pick her up.

\- As for dinner, I am always the one cooking every single night, unless we order out. I cook, clean up and load the dishwasher while he’s on his phone and the kids are running around.

\- I also do the nightly bath but he will help to get them ready in their pyjamas.

\- I am the one that reads the kids their bed time stories and then put them to bed. He will sometimes play with them before they get put to bed. My grievance is that if i’m with the kids, he is never with us. He only is with the kids if i’m not with them. It’s like we can’t alll 4 just be together as a family. I feel like we are single parenting instead of spending time together as a family.

\- after the kids go to bed (we are lucky that they both sleep by 7:30), my husband is already in our bed and on his ipad with his headphones. He doesn’t even think to come down and maybe help me or spend time with me (i have communicated that this bothers me)

\- I go downstairs every night after the kids sleep and just ensure there is nothing else to clean up and I basically eat by myself and then turn the dishwasher on. We never have a meal together. My husband will have ate by that point too.

\- At night, we just don’t spend any proper time together. we will talk but i’m on my phone and he’s on his phone

\- when we are intimate, it’s actually still really great and I’m lucky that we still have that physical chemistry but I otherwise do feel very disconnected from him.

Other areas of our life and responsibilities

1. for extra curriculars for the kids - we both split this fairly well in terms of taking them to their respective activities
2. For any sort of social gathering with family or friends. I ALWAYS am the ONLY one planning or organizing with both sides of the family. for example christmas, birthdays etc, it’s me that figures out when we are seeing which family or which set of friends. Basically if it wasn’t for me, he would never think to have a social life or organize anything. if we host anything at our place, it’s me figuring out what we are doing and what we are eating etc. When i complain about this - his response is to “not have events and just leave it then”. I mean really?
3. Christmas gifts and gifts for the kids- he does all of this himself but what annoys me is that he doesn’t involve me. He picks the gifts himself and he usually will ask for my opinion when I’m busy during the day at work. It’s almost like it’s just something on his check list and again something I wish we could do together
4. Laundry - he does do all the laundry but I have to constantly remind him to do it. at this point i feel like taking over this task
5. He does do the home repairs and the trash take out
6. Grocery planning - all meal planning falls on me. I do it all. I make our grocery list and I figure out what we are eating for the week
7. Trip planning - I plan all trips. when i try to get his involvement, he has some insights but doesn’t care to plan anything. If I don’t plan an anniversary trip or a birthday trip or a quick getaway…. it just simply wouldn’t happen. it’s not on his radar at all

do we hve date nights? sure. But i usually again have to plan it. otherwise not happening.

He is a good person.He is kind but my problem is that I think he’s passive. I sometimes wonder if i even mean anything to him? I’m scared we are going to wake up one day and not even recognize ourselves in this relationship anymore

I am genuinely terrified and just wondering if i’m over exaggerating

I have expressed my concerns but i don’t think he really gets it. He promises to work on it but then nothing changes

am I doing something wrong too?

is this a season of life and normal? What can we do to fix it.

I would like to say that he is honestly generally a supportive person to me. If I ask him for work advice , he is always supportive and he has never called me any names or been abusive in any way. He never shouts. He is a good father but I feel like I am on the bottom of his priority list. He is choosing to not focus on this relationship, that part honestly hurts",5,1767331760.0,workingmoms,4,1.0,False

# Beyond the Bean: What is Intelligent Coffee?

The aroma of coffee is familiar, but the concept of ""intelligent coffee"" might be new. It's not about coffee that talks, but rather coffee systems that use smart technology to brew your perfect cup, every time. Think of it as a barista in your kitchen, programmed to understand your preferences.

These advanced coffee machines go beyond simple programming. They often connect to Wi-Fi, allowing you to control brewing remotely via an app. Some can even learn your daily habits, automatically preparing your preferred blend at your usual wake-up time. Sensors monitor water temperature, grind size, and brew time with incredible precision, ensuring optimal extraction and flavor.

*   **Personalized Profiles:** Save your exact preferences for strength, temperature, and volume, and share them with family members.
*   **Remote Brewing:** Start your coffee maker from bed or on your commute home.
*   **Smart Maintenance:** Receive alerts for cleaning, descaling, or when it's time to refill beans or water.

There are things that I dislike about him as well, but I think the way my partner goes about his dislike is a little excessive in terms of punishment.

For example, I tend to walk either too slow or too fast in the grocery store for his taste (which I understand is annoying) but instead of correcting me in that moment, he will give me the silent treatment for hours and say it was “cause and effect” for what I did even if I’m clueless to it.  If I try to hold his arm so I can stay mindful of it, he will ask me not to do that. The “cause and effect” of me doing something and him ignoring me for hours happens at least once a week now, even after I constantly express how it makes me feel.

Today, we headed to get a coffee before grabbing lunch. I had shared with him about a week ago that my appetite has been worsening and I could barely eat lately. I’ve always been a bit insecure about being underweight, which he knows so this has been ironically worsening this issue. When we arrived at the restaurant, I asked him what he would be eating. He asked me what I would be eating instead, to which I responded I didn’t know just yet. He then proceeded to go on a rant on how “wasteful” I am and how me not knowing meant I would only take 2 bites. He goes on this rant a lot as well. I told him I did not mind paying for my meal at all because I understood not wanting to just waste money if I ended up not eating my meal. He then proceeds to tell me how “awkward and irritating” it is to watch me barely eat my food and sped off from the restaurant after I repeatedly asked him if we could just go in and pay for our meals separately. I cried and expressed to him how hurtful this was to me given my appetite being something I can’t control and something I was already self-conscious about, and he told me that it’s my fault because I should’ve told him I was self conscious and to not speak on it at all. Completely ignoring the fact that it was (in my opinion) rude to speed off from the restaurant in the first place. He parked my car, keys still inside, and stormed in the house to scroll on social media while I cried in the bed. After I spoke up and we briefly talked about the issue, he told me I could leave.

I really do not know what to do. I feel as though sometimes our minor problems get blown up into this and results in me being ignored for hours or blamed for his actions, but I don’t know how to get him to stop. He will act annoyed that I bring up how he treats me and expects me to just forget it happened. I also don’t know if this is a sign that he does not truly like me, because these reactions (such as asking me to leave his house, the silent treatment, etc.) for mild annoyances happen frequently.

1q1pzwx,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1q1pzwx/chrysalis/,Chrysalis,"Hey everyone! I have been a huge fan of Creepcast for a long time now and have always had a love for scary stories, so I thought I would post one of my own here! It is entitled, ""Chrysalis."" I am very open to any and all feedback, I hope you enjoy!

**Chrysalis** 

*Trigger warning for claustrophobia, parasites, body horror, and heavy religious themes*

When God created butterflies, the angels were jealous. They were jealous because there was another creature made by God that radiated beauty, radiated warmth and excitement everywhere it went. They were jealous because God had created yet *another* creature that could fly and spread its holiness across the world. It just wasn’t fair that angels would have to fight with some earthly creature, some disgusting *secular* thing. 

So God relented. He made it so that before a butterfly could become a butterfly, it had to start off as a near defenseless worm. If the worm - or caterpillar, as He called it - survived long enough, it would start to sprout wings and thin out over time and become a butterfly as we know it. God saw that it was good and made it so.

But the angels persisted in their jealousy and anger, and so God thought on it. It wasn’t enough to the angels that they just had to *wait* to become a butterfly. To the angels, they had to fight for it, just as they did everyday for God’s approval. They had to be brutally hurt and changed before they were worthy. So God shifted focus and came back with the most torturous punishment He could think of. For a butterfly to become a butterfly, its initial form, the one it had spent its entire life inhabiting and getting to know, would slowly and painstakingly be melted down into a fine sludge until nothing of its original body remained. It would take 2 weeks, almost nothing by human standards, but a near *eternity* to a creature with such a short lifespan. Only after it had been dissolved into some unrecognizable fluid, some slime that could never or have ever been considered life, would it form into a butterfly. It still had to break through its cell into the world, taste the harsh air it had once breathed in through totally different anatomy; but once it had finally done that, it was free. Free to see God’s world, free from His punishment.

The lesson has never been lost on me. Since I was a boy it was clear: to be a part of God’s kingdom you must pay handsomely. Before you can be holy, you must be broken down to your very core, your essence and your faith has to be drained from you like someone wringing a wet towel. To stand before God, you have to show that you’re worthy of His grace with blood.

It took time, I went about it all wrong for so much of my life. I thought *I* had to be the cocoon, that I would be the vessel from which holiness was born. 

I started slowly, at first just swallowing seeds here and there. I prayed to God every night that they bloom inside of me, that I would check under my fingernail and see a sprout. I so desperately wanted to be full of God’s creation, I wanted my stomach to burst at the seams, have my skin split from the pressure of vines pressing against it on the other side. I swallowed different seeds every morning like they were a multivitamin. Maybe if I could just find the one species that could take root within me, it would bloom and I could bulge with its growth.

Finally, it dawned on me. The food I was eating was killing the plant before it could even grow. It had to compete for space in my vessel. A butterfly could never grow if it had some fly buzzing around in there with it! How could I be so stupid?

So I stopped eating. I drank water, and eventually fertilizer as well. It hurt my stomach so much, but it was good. It was good because I knew I was becoming holy. I knew God was looking down upon his subject and smiling. I know now that he was ashamed of me, for this was never my path.

I fainted a lot but still found the strength to go look in the mirror and conduct a full body search for any sort of growth. There never was any, and I became utterly ashamed of myself.

It was all part of God’s trials for me. To stand before him, you must be melted down into clay so that He may reform you again. I just had to try again. So I did.

Botflies are nothing like butterflies. They’re disgusting and writhing little parasites that take root in mammals, and unlike caterpillars, they never turn into anything worthwhile. I always wondered how God could’ve made butterflies and then turned around and created botflies. It just doesn’t make sense. Now I know of course that God has quite the sense of humor, and the dichotomy is really very funny if you think about it!

Botflies use *mammals* as their cocoons. A mature botfly will lay its eggs on the host, usually through the mouth or skin, and the larva will spend a grueling number of weeks gestating and growing, rooting through and feeding on organ tissue until they see fit to leave. They’re disgusting creatures that infest the sickest animals they can find, but I always had some sympathy for them. If Jesus could walk with the prostitutes and criminals, then I could too. 

So I let them live inside of me, just for a little while, at first. It was easy to carve some space for them in my arms and my legs, but hard for them not to fall out before they were ready. So I went deeper into my limbs and eventually let them inside my stomach too. They enjoy festering wounds, so I let my cuts infect until they oozed puss. They enjoy the smell of death, so when infections spread through my foot and it started to rot off my ankle, I let it be. I could feel them writhe underneath my skin, smell my foot falling off, and I could almost *taste* the air of decay. Just another one of God’s little tests. But they kept dying. The ungrateful little fucks kept dying. And Goddamnit (I’ll make it up to Him for saying that) it was so fucking frustrating because I was trying to give them a chance. I *wanted* them to become beautiful, I *wanted* them to bloom inside of me, emerge out of my mouth and open wounds flapping beautiful wings they had evolved while inside of me. I wanted, no, *needed* them to use me for greatness, feed on my body so they could become something bigger than me, something holy. If God could create a butterfly from nothing but a fucking worm, and I was made in His image, then why couldn’t I? Wasn’t this His plan for me? Didn’t He want me to live as He did? The flies couldn’t even give me that. *God* couldn’t give me that.

I lived with that anger for a long time. I tried over and over again. I experimented with tapeworms, fleas, and ticks to no avail. I was sick with worry, worry that I was missing my chance to make it into Heaven, to sit by my creator’s side and rest my head on His shoulder while we sip on coffee together. I sacrificed so much, lost so much time, what more could I do? 

It struck me then, that I had gotten it all wrong. I was never meant to be the cocoon. My body was simply not *fit* to be the cocoon. When God created me, he knew it too. He created me to be the caterpillar. It hit me all at once: I was never supposed to live a regular life. I was never supposed to live the best I could and go to Heaven as a regular soul. I was made for more than that, I was made to become an angel. I was put on this Earth to someday escape and serve God as one of his loyal workers. It made sense, it made so much sense. As a boy I hid away from everyone. I hid in pantries and cabinets, away from the world. I always thought I was a freak that would have to repent for this behavior some day, but now, it all made sense. God was preparing me for my ultimate trial. It was merely practice for a destiny that was so far beyond me I couldn’t have even begun to comprehend it yet. But I was ready now, after years of toiling. It was time.

I snuck off in the dead of night to a new housing development. The homes were nearly finished, but still not sealed shut. It was easy to find the right fit, with just the right gap. I got on my stomach and crawled through the space under the porch and found myself under the foundation. My stomach and torso were coated in a thick layer of dirt and grime, but that was okay. If anything, it was fitting. I was just another worm, rifling through the dirt, trying to survive another day; but not for long. It took a while but eventually I found it, the spot where the cold air return would be installed. Totally empty, ready for me.

I slowly shuffled my knees under my torso. With my knees underneath me, my back scraped against the bottom of the foundation. I could feel splinters piercing through my skin as I made my way to the gap in the wall. I twisted my head to the side so I could just barely poke my head through the hole. My ears scraped brutally through the unfinished space, and the sound of flesh grating against unsanded wood nearly made me jump and bang my head. I composed myself with some deep breaths. It was time for the hardest part. I scrunched my shoulders as close to my torso as I could possibly handle and began pushing through. The pain was immense. My skin tore and scratched heavily against the walls. Huge gobs of flesh were stripped off like the skin off a potato.  It was so tight, it wasn’t working. I pushed more. Nothing. I began to panic. If this wasn’t going to work what was I going to do? I can’t live as a normal person, I knew that. I was so much more than normal, I was meant to be great, I was meant to be an angel. I pushed harder, and more skin came off.  It wasn’t fair, it wasn’t fucking fair that royalty like myself be forced to live with such pathetic fucking souls, such insignificant little wor - *POP.*

I heard it, and then I felt it. Blistering pain from my right shoulder. I screamed out in pain. I reflexively shot my head down to look but the right side of my face was pressed firmly against the wall and wasn’t going to budge. It hardly mattered, it was obvious what had happened. My ligaments and muscle tissue had been brutally torn from the bone. My shoulder was dislocated. It was a gift from God. He had heard my struggles, and given me the path forward.

Tears hung in my eyes as I pushed farther. I was light headed, but that was another gift to make it easier to push forward without any thought. My destroyed shoulder bumped and scraped against the passage and it hurt so much but it felt so good to make progress. It took another couple minutes, occasionally taking a moment to catch my breath or cry a little, but when my shoulders finally squeezed through I nearly squealed in delight. It was divine confirmation that this was going to work, that this was my path to Heaven. But I couldn’t linger in my pride too long, it was time to get the rest of the way in. I braced my stomach against the bottom of the opening and pushed hard off my feet. My face slid slowly against the dry wall as my torso moved up. It was working. I kept pushing. My back arched to unnatural degrees as I climbed deeper and deeper into the passage. It cracked and ached from the intense pressure. I felt my spine struggling to bend further back, but I pushed it more. I swear I could hear it creak like an old rat trap being set, ready to snap at even the slightest little change in pressure. I pushed forward. My back scraped hard against the opening and the wall took giant strips of flesh from it. My shoulder still shot fiery bolts of pain throughout my whole body and my neck felt ready to break at any moment. I screamed and cried in pain as I pushed more, inch by inch. I finally understood what the caterpillar must feel like when it’s time to become a butterfly. 

The more I came to my feet, the more skin I lost on my back. I wish I could know what it looked like, know what shade of red my muscle fiber is. My hot and sticky blood did little in the way of lubricating the way forward, but I didn’t mind because I knew that I was already beginning to be melted down by Him. I gasped in euphoria at the thought.

When my back was through, I took a moment to reflect. It was working. It hurt so much but it didn’t matter because it was working. My infected foot from when I let those parasites dig into it was freely oozing pus and blood. It smelled divine. It smelled like Heaven.

It was easy to get the rest of my body in. I first raised my good foot, very slowly so as to not lose any progress, then my infected foot. When I was officially inside my cocoon, I cried tears of joy. It hurt so fucking much, but it felt good. My arms were locked firmly at my sides. There was no chance of escape, even if I wanted to. 

My face pressed heavily against the dry wall, and my back sat uncomfortably against the insulation. I could feel hundreds of thousands of fiber glass splinters pierce into my raw back. I felt it merge within me, my muscle tissue melting into it as it melted into my back. As I took a deep breath, it entered my lungs too. Every breath stung and I had to fight every urge inside of me to resist the pain. If I was going to become an angel, I had to show God that I was ready for this, ready for whatever he sent me. This was only the beginning. 

I settled in. Within a few days, hunger took over every square inch of my body. Within a few days of that, my body began digesting my organs for nutrients. Over months, I could feel my form losing shape as blood and pus and decay took over every limb, then every organ, then every cell. My flesh fell off until only muscle remained. All part of His plan, I just have to wait.

And so I waited. How long has it been? Years? Decades? Everyday, the smell of my own feces, urine, blood, and rot enter through my nose and fill my skull until I feel like it’s about to burst. I love it. It’s one of God’s little gifts for me while I wait to become one of his angels. 

Sometimes I hear noises from the other side. Murmuring and scratching, sometimes even some soft beeping. It’s no doubt the other angels checking in on me, making sure I’m coming along. Right now, I hear it more than ever.

I hear two angels discussing something: they’ve been hearing breathing from this wall, smelling something foul? Do they know it’s me in here? Do they know that I’m ready, ready to be their brother, to serve our father in Heaven?

I hear a loud whack, and I see a crack of light form within my cell, now another. 

*It’s happening.* 

I see heaven forming right before my very eyes. I’ve put in the work, I answered God’s call. When I was a boy, nothing but a little writhing larva, I saw the call and I answered it. I knew that one day I would stand by His side. I knew it then and I know it now that I was always destined for so much more than this accursed Earth. The plants, all the parasites I let crawl inside of my body were nothing but stepping stones to my emerging. God and his beautiful cherubim are here to set me free from myself, here to send me to Heaven, to the rest of eternity.

God and his angels pierce through my cocoon one strike at a time until the light is too much for my eyes to bear. For years I have been in utter darkness, so devoid of light that at times I thought I’d gone blind. I close my eyes to shield from the Heavenly rays but it’s not enough. My eyes feel like they’re melting in my skull. One of the strikes at my cocoon meets my chest, then another. It hurts, it hurts so much, but I know that from these wounds my heavenly form will emerge.

Finally, the wall gives way and I fall out in one fell swoop. The noise my body makes when it hits the floor is disgustingly wet from an eternity of soaking in my own blood and decay. I hadn’t expected the floor to be this hard, but maybe God prefers it that way. Maybe he prefers to walk on something firm when he prepares his coffee in the morning. I have so many things to ask him about!

I open my eyes to soak it all in. In front of me stands a woman with her hands to her face and a man holding an axe. Their eyes widen in horror as realization sets in. Mine do too, and we all start screaming.",1,1767330963.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,0.99,False

But one thing I've learned based on several Clavicular clips is that below a certain looks level he thinks people are sub human, and he showed such god tier restraint during that interview not once calling Graham subhuman.

I have never been more proud of clavicular, maybe those nootropics gave him just enough of a mental boost to hold back the tsunami of impulse to label Graham what he was in Claviculars hierarchy, a tsunami as tall as olympus mons.

Everyone here should congratulate him.

PS:  for clarity, to most normal people Graham looks slightly below average, but nothing crazy.  But to Clavicular, this is what Graham looks like:

1q1pzcg,https://i.redd.it/3wdam0i6evag1.png,Review of MFK Oud extrait and few others,"In the last 6 months i had acquired a few niche fragrances and this is a short review of them.

Maison Francis Kurkdjian  Oud Extrait: The ""Couture"" Oud is incredibly polished, shimmering, and sophisticated rather than ""barnyard"" or animalic.
 The notes in this include Saffron, Elemi gum, Laotian Oud, and Cedarwood. It feels like wearing a heavy silk garment. It is spicy, resinous, and has a metallic cleanliness that makes it very wearable for formal occasions. It's a very westernised Oud so there's no funk or skankiness in this. 


Parfums de Marly Layton Exclusif: The darker, more rebellious older brother of the original Layton.
 The notes include Civet, Oud, Almond, Coffee, and Apple. It takes the mass-appeal DNA of Layton and adds a layer of  thickness with the animalic notes and coffee make it deeper, woodier, and much more serious. When I had first worn it it didn't suit my taste, the initial blast was a bit off putting, it smelled very green. But once it was left on the skin for sometime it became much more beautiful. If anyone has smelled layton, imagine the sweet vanillic start of layton covered with a blanket of green raw coffee beans and with a slight animalic note of civet. That's layton exclusif. Owning both Layton and layton exclusif would not be redundant. They smell different enough to warrant owning both.

Parfums de Marly | Layton
 The ultimate ""crowd-pleaser"" niche fragrance. I had finished my full 125ml bottle of Layton (which is rare considering my collection size) and this is my second bottle. Its one of the very few fragrances that has actually gotten me a compliment. Very versatile and mass pleasing yet unique.
 Notes include Apple, Lavender, Vanilla, and Cardamom.
 It is Sweet, spicy, and versatile and balances a fresh opening with a creamy, warm dry down. I have written a full length of review of Layton if anyone wishes to read a little bit more about it. 

Nishane Mana

This is a rose oud combo done in the same tone as Ombre Nomade. 
 Notes include Turkish Rose, Saffron, Ginger, Oud, Leather, and Castoreum. Anyone who loves Ombre Nomade would definitely love this one as well. But if I was told compare both Mana has a little bit more depth and is much much stronger than Ombre Nomade. (ON is no slouch by any means). But this would probably even drown out ON if worn side by side. The fragranratica vote for longevity is an actual reflection of how obscenely long lasting it is. The key would be to spray just one spray if you're indoors and two if you're going out. Anything more than that you're asking to be kicked out for attacking people's nostrils. 
All that being said it smells absolutely beautiful.
 

Clive Christian Blonde Amber:
 This is the hype child in the fragrance community when it comes to Clive Christian. I would be honest to say this was a blind buy. But it turned out to be a good one. Rum, Cardamom, Amber, and Dried Fruits. 
This is part of the Noble Collection, this is a complex, boozy, and smoky amber. It has a ""glowing"" quality to it. If you see the actual note breakdown it's too many notes blended to one like Roja and Spirit of Dubai fragrances. Its as if they decided to throw everything into the sinkhole and pulled out a miracle. The notes alone don't make sense but combined it gives a very beautiful fragrant experience. 

To cut it short and describe..it has a bubble gum sweetness throughout. But if a royal bubble gum was a thing that's how it would smell like. 
This could be used for very upscale evening occasions.  


Fragrance du Bois Sahraa:
  A masterclass in authentic Oud used without the skank expression . Quietly confident and exceptionally balanced
 Notes are Rose, Geranium, Sandalwood, Saffron, and 100% Pure farm grown Oud.
 Unlike many ""oud"" fragrances that use synthetics, this uses the real deal. It is airy, slightly floral, and creamy. It feels like a soft desert breeze rather than a heavy smoke cloud. It is buttery smooth, this is one fragrance i find it hard to describe. But it smells heavenly. It isn't a loud projector but creates a warm aura cloud around you. 

I have written a review of this standalone as well for anyone wishing to get an idea of the smell. 

Dior Patchouli Imperial: This fragrance is no longer available as it's discontinued. I had purchased this solely for the comparison that it's Diors take on Chanel Coromandel which is my signature scent. And I trust the craft of Francois Demachy. I found a 250ml bottle up on deal and copped it up. I guess I'm set for years. 
 The fragrance is very posh smelling sophisticated and gives bohemian intellectual vibe.  Clean, earthy, and refined patchouli, Coriander, Smoke, and Amber. This is a ""dry"" patchouli. It strips away the damp, ""dirty"" associations of the note and replaces them with a woody, spicy elegance. It’s professional, unisex, and very elegantly ""Dior"". Performance is exceptional two to three sprays and it leaves a beautiful trail. Incidentally it was one of the very fragrance which got a positive reaction from my mother. She remarked that it smelled very nice. So i guess it means something 😄. It is very similar to Coromandel minus the white chocolate accord and an improved performance and sillage is a bonus.

I’ve been trying to be more intentional about where I spend my money lately, especially with cafés. I really want to support places that are actually local, community-driven, and not quietly backed by massive wealth or corporate interests.

For a while, I really enjoyed Fenyk Coffee & Social. On the surface, it felt like one of those rare spots that values community, creativity, and small-business culture. I liked spending time there and wanted to believe in what they stood for.

Over time though, I personally became uncomfortable with how the business is run and who’s actually behind it. Without getting into drama, it started to feel less like a grassroots café and more like another example of branding “local” while operating with priorities that don’t align with that image. It was disappointing, especially when you realize how common this is becoming.

I read it a few years ago and it was a fanfic that grew Sonadow on me.

It was a fanfiction on [Fanfiction.net](http://Fanfiction.net) and it was the plot of Sonic getting sent to an alternate universe where the him of that world has been MIA (Imprisoned as by Fiona Fox in no-zone as she takes his appearance to cause trouble) Shadow of this world finds sonic and helps him recover while acting strange. Turns out this universe had Sonic and Shadow in a relationship in secret. Everyone just thinks Sonic has amnesia and that he is ”their” Sonic. Most of the plot is the author teasing us that they had something going on from finding a photo album, Shadow doing things like grabbing a blanket for Sonic when he was injured, Shadow knowing things like where Sonic is ticklish.

Anyway, when this is confronted eventually after many chapters Shadow shatters a coffee mug and they argue more. Both come to terms with their situation.

I remember something about sandwiches in one chapter, learning the term “jump my bones” from this, a maze near the end, alternative vs og reality confrontation, No-Zone cops, Eggman being dead, etc.

In the end, Shadow learning that it wasn’t really his sonic makes him mad and sonic hurt as he developed feelings. The og shadow talks with Alt Shadow and alt convinces shadow that Sonic isa well worthy pursuit which he says perhaps to while gazing longly. Fiona goes to jail again and everyone goes home.

1q1psmj,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1q1psmj/item_5_kill_the_old_me/,Item 5: Kill the Old Me,"On New Year's Eve, drunk and lonely, I found a minimalist website titled ""The January Manifesto."" It promised to help me become who I was born to be. I laughed, signed the digital contract, and typed out five sincere wishes for the new year:

1. Stop biting my nails.
2. Get a smile that makes people look.
3. Lose 15kg fast.
4. Have an open heart.
5. Kill the old, failed Kaique.

I woke up on January 1st screaming. My fingernails weren't just short; they were gone. Where the nails should have been, there was only smooth, continuous skin. I couldn't bite what didn't exist.

On January 2nd, I fell out of bed. My left leg ended abruptly at the knee. A massive chunk of my right calf was missing, as if scooped out by an ice cream spoon. I dragged myself to the scale. I was exactly 15kg lighter. It wasn't a diet; it was subtraction.

On January 3rd, I woke up with my mouth locked in agony. My lips had retracted and fused near my ears, exposing massive, new, porcelain-white teeth that were too big for my skull. I couldn't close my mouth. I had a permanent, predatory grin.

On January 4th, my sternum cracked open with a wet snap. My ribs peeled back like a bloomed flower, exposing my beating heart to the cold air of the bedroom. I had to wrap my torso in kitchen plastic wrap just to keep the dust out. A literal ""open heart"".

On January 5th, the front door opened.

A man walked in. He was handsome, fit, with a charming smile and manicured nails. He was the Resolution. He looked down at me, a bleeding, one-legged, skin-wrapped monster huddled on the floor, with pity.

""Item 5,"" he said, using my voice, but without the stutter. ""Kill the old Kaique.""

He didn't use a weapon. He pulled a heavy-duty trash bag from his pocket. I was too weak to fight back as he suffocated me.

I woke up this morning feeling fantastic. 70kg, ripped muscles, perfect teeth. I have a date tonight.

I went to the kitchen to make coffee and noticed a smell coming from under the sink. Like meat starting to rot.

I opened the cabinet. Deep in the back, behind the cleaning supplies, there is a large, heavy black trash bag wrapped in duct tape.

I stared at it for a second. I felt a phantom pain in my chest, but I pushed it away. The old Kaique was paranoid. I am not.

Besides, today is trash pickup day. I’ll take the bag out on my way to work.",15,1767330350.0,shortscarystories,1,0.94,False

Now this is the actual design and not a factory defect as I assumed, so getting a replacement is out.

So I was wondering if I have any options for de-yellowing them? I've used bleach before, but only on tough white towels I use for work.

There are many things that have happened over the course of my life but the main thing now is just the difficulty of the holidays and how if I don't stay with them mostly I have nowhere to go. I really care/d for my dad because I felt he was more rational than my mum but he's really more of an enabler and escalates as fast as she does. 

I'm 32F. My parents 68F and 77M. I grabbed a parcel from the mailbox and dad keeps some chicken wire in there to hold up the letters. It scratched my dad when I grabbed my parcel and fell out and scratched my leg. I had my tetanus shot a few years ago but. I thought I'd tell my dad about it because it's a hazard. 

He immediately told me that I'm having a go at him over it and that there's disinfectant in the bathroom I can use or I can go to hospital. He presented it like I was being irrational. I said he doesn't need to speak to me like that and I'm not having a go at him but alerting him to a hazard. When I left to get the disinfectant mum said, ""she wants us to listen to her but she won't listen to us."" I chose to not let it go, and I confronted her about why she was talking about me like that when I was talking to dad about a hazard, and they both flew off the handle, about how I always need to be heard but I don't hear them, they talk over me constantly and tell me I'm wrong when I'm not wrong about things I know, or that I want to investigate ways to do things (on the computer for example) but they know better. Mum also tells me how things are and a lot of conversations with her are like a lecture where she tells you what you're doing wrong and how it annoys her and the consequences instead of asking you to not do something. 

Like say my dad almost dropped his container of coffee and she ranted at him about how he always holds it wrong and how it'll fall and spill everywhere and she'll have to clean it up, instead of saying, hey could you be more careful with the container?

It ended up with them yelling at me to fuck off and they're fucking sick of this shit and it's me that's so argumentative and I said I don't have conversations like these with anyone else, because I don't! And then mum said she heard me on the phone arguing with other people. I've only been on the phone gushing about a book to my friend and watching the freaking NHK NY special, talking about LADS and my games. So I told her that and she flipped to, ""OKAY, I'M WRONG THEN! YOU NEVER ARGUE WITH ANYONE AND EVERYTHING IS PERFECT!"" gesturing with her hands all over the place. 

I'm so tired of this. Without my mum things are mostly OK with my dad. He's getting old like I just wanna hang out over the holidays and like they still make me do their fucking happy family rituals like filming a happy new year video.

1q1pmul,https://i.redd.it/pxyu9g43bvag1.png,Before The Coffee Gets Cold : Review,"So Before the Coffee Gets Cold was one the best reads of 2025 and wow… this book hit me in a way I didn’t expect.  

It’s set in this tiny Tokyo café, Funiculi Funicula, where you can travel back in time—but only until your cup of coffee gets cold. But there’s a catch: no matter what you do in the past, the future won’t change. At first that feels pointless, but the more you read, the more you realize it’s not about fixing mistakes—it’s about understanding them.  

The story unfolds through four women, each with their own reasons for wanting to revisit the past. Their journeys are heartbreaking but also strangely comforting. The rules of time travel, while frustrating, end up being the very thing that makes their experiences meaningful.  

What I loved most is how gentle and cozy the book feels. It’s not sci-fi in the traditional sense—it’s more about closure, forgiveness, and letting go. Honestly, it reminded me of Days at the Morisaki Bookshop (another Japanese novel with that same quiet, introspective vibe). Both are about healing and finding small comforts when life feels heavy.  

If you’ve ever wished for just a few more minutes with someone you’ve lost, this book will resonate. It’s slow, tender, and life-affirming.  ",1,1767329876.0,bookweiser,1,1.0,False

Let's call his dad ""Tony.""

Upon our arrival to meet the boyfriend's parents at a pub, we did our introductions and took seats. I was seated between my partner and Tony. The conversation was pretty amicable. People were asking eachother about jobs and school etc. The sort of things you'd expect upon first meeting people. Unanimously, everyone decided to order some coffees and a couple people got desserts too.

A bit of context: I'm not a religious person at all. Despite that, I'm totally happy to hear when people are religious and practicing. People should be free to believe whatever they want. My partner's family are Christian. They're totally chill with my atheism and say that its fine with them. Very chill people. Whenever they say Grace at their house, they don't make me join in or anything, and I just sit quietly and respectfully-- Put my head down or something.

Ok, back to the restaurant. While we sat and chatted, eventually the coffee and deserts came out. Before anyone took a bite or a sip, Tony said something to the effect of ""Lets say Grace"" and people started grabbing eachother's hands. I put my hands into my lap and put my head down. Tony reached over and grabbed one of my hands out of my lap. I pulled my hand away and just said ""Oh, sorry. I don't say Grace. I'll just sit quietly, don't mind me."" and I figured it would be over.

Tony instead reached around me, grabbed my shoulder and said ""Then I'm going to do this."" Before I could argue, Tony said a quick Grace and then let go of me. Then he followed it up by looking at me and saying ""And we're going to change that."" Suggesting that they needed to change me to be someone who says Grace.

Upset by that comment, I said ""Yeah, good luck with that."" (Certainly not the most respectful comment but alas.)

My partner and her father were looking at me after that with apologetic looks on their faces since it was clear that I was bothered by that exchange.

I really disconnected from the whole event after that because I was pretty annoyed. All I could think about was how that exchange would have gone down if I had said that ""I was going to change that"" about the fact that they DID say Grace.

Having told this story to a few other people, I'd been called an Asshole by some who said that the correct thing to do is to just say Grace and get over myself. I felt like I shouldn't have to do something I'm not comfortable with. A few others agreed with my thoughts.

I reached on the venue at 7.20pm. It was literally filled with many people. Families. Friends. Couples.

I had managed to book a side table of two, near the window. So it was the perfect place for us. I had bought a bouquet (yes, even after so many replies were telling me not to buy it, but my heart told me to).

Near me, a couple, whom I presumed were on their first date, were shy and laughing. I was getting butterflies from seeing them and waiting for her. 

It got 7.30, but she didn't come. I didn't mind as it was the 31st, so late was acceptable. But 7.30 turned into 8pm. And 8 turned to 8.20pm. 

Now, as I said the restaurant was filled, I was getting side eyes from many people around me, even that couple.  Because I was a joker, sitting on a table, had drunk 2 cold coffees (told him for low sugar) and 2 water bottles already. Without ordering any food. That too with a bouquet(of 20 flowers).

I called her so many times after 8pm, and she didn't pick up. And when 8.30pm touched, I can't tell you, I had tears in my eyes. It felt bad. I still waited, maybe she would come, I thought. It felt bad whenever the waiter was asking me to order food, and i was telling him to wait. Even he was giving me look.

8.30 turned into 9pm. Ordered a tomato soup.. while just looking down, embarrassed, trying to stop my tears. And finally at 9pm, I left...

After leaving the restaurant, I couldn't stop myself and cried in the parking lot. Thrown away the bouquet. Empty stomach. Slept witb tears.

 And while riding back to my house on the Royal Enfield (which I borrowed from my cousin), I slipped, thankfully I didn't get injured, but the bike got rashes... And got scolded by Papa and Uncle for that. Cousin told me he will never give his RE to me again.

#TLDR I want to start by saying this happened on the NYE of 2024. I'm sorry that this is a very very long story but I hope those who read understand the need for the timeline of information. 


The people in this story are:

Myself F (29), my partner M (34), my brother (27) and ""best friend"" or ""roomie"" F (28).


                                   Act 1

August 2022:

When we first moved in with her it was to help her leave a bad living situation with an abusive ex and get help her get back on her feet. She didn't have work for the first 6 months of her living with us and was living off of decent government pay till we got into a work program. This helped her get a barista job. She worked this job for a year, but let's discuss how this year actually went.


April 2023:

She didn't drive. I did. Now we live in a city where transit is very accessible and a major part of our cities commuting, so she never had a reason to not take transit. Except when she claimed that she was medically incapable of doing so. Let's clear this up quickly. She constantly had medical issues since I knew her in highschool. Somehow she never had any doctor confirm them though? Except for ovarian cysts that we're removed and the surgery was in 2018. Now, how would I know about her medical stuff? Well aside from her posting her entire personal life on her snapchat story, she had ""medical anxiety"", meaning I was tasked to drive her to see any medical professional and go to the office with her. She had apparently seen specialists, gotten diagnosed for multiple things but when asked to provide the paperwork or files for work purposes, or to claim some type of government funding, she wasn't able to due to the hospitals ""withholding it from her"". 


November 2023:

In November she somehow ""broke her toe"" (literally her words but doctor confirmed a fracture), by dropping a stool on it. She was on UNPAID MEDICAL LEAVE FOR 6 MONTHS, this was 5 months after she got the job. Oh and if you haven't put the pieces together by now, this means we have covered ALL of rent, food, bills, her cats needs or whatever else for over 6 months all because we thought she was medically incapable of working. She's my best friend, why would I think she's lying to me about being able to go back to work right? In total she had only legitimately worked for 6 months as she ended up quiting a month after she returned from medical leave...


                                   Act 2

December/January 2024:

We had planned a perfect trip to meet our gaming friends who we'd known for years for the first time, as well as celebrating one of their weddings! This had been planned for MONTHS and out of everyone I was the most excited as I am closest with them, and have known them longer. People were flying in from other countries, we were doing a 13 hour drive, it was a massive plan for us, it also wasn't a super long trip, 5 very full days, 1 being a wedding.


All of January 2024:

She was invited to all of this originally, though had said she didn't want to go for whatever reason. But now that she was on ""medical leave"" she was free to go all of a sudden! She didn't have a passport or plan for this trip at all. Our friends wanted her there so we pitched to get her one and express it. All she needed to do was go into the office, complete the interview and forms. We were told the express would take less than 2 weeks so she just needed to go in ASAP. She didn't go in till almost 16 days before we were supposed to leave. Why she waited so long? I do not know! The kicker, it was supposed to arrive the day we left. I thought whatever as long as I got in as soon as the passport office opened and left before noon. I wasn't expecting a parcel impending snowstorm to hit the night before!We are supposed to drive out of the country, the passport hadn't arrived, and I had to go to a DIFFERENT passport office at 7am to get them to express MAKE ONE by noon or I wasn't bringing her on the trip. I refused to leave later then noon that day with or without her. After lots of controlled anger and magic on my part, we got one.

We drove the most hellish 15 hours before we arrived at our destination at 5am the next morning. That trip was hell. Not the friends or anything we did with them of course! But her. She was uncomfortable and constantly moody, always needed to smoke weed before we went anywhere, had little to no money, and was late for almost every planned event, she made it about her travel anxiety, being in a new country, not having legal marijuana in this state, it was simply all too much for her. At the end of the trip she even admitted she wish she hadn't gone. From that moment I was very emotionally done with her.


May 2024:

She goes back to work and quits a month later, almost on the anniversary of her start date. This was also after I had left my job as well (due to many things) and was having issues finding a new one, after I spoke to my household and my partner, we all came to an agreement that I would stay home and focus on my passion projects and trying to stream full-time to contribute even a little. She wanted to do nails full-time which we supported as we thought it would be easier for her body to work sitting down, thinking fine we'll give it 2 months but after that she HAS to get any job because we are now running on our savings, literally trying to save her. Not to mention she is kind of gross? She would leaves dishes in her room for days, keep food out, never throw her garbage away enough. It was disgusting to live with her like that.


                                    Act 3

September 2024:

Well doing nails failed. She apparently didn't know how to market herself properly. So when in doubt OF it out! I guess. She thought that would get her some type of income to atleast get her cats food. Beginning of September her cat gets sick and is acting weird, which immediately makes me worried as I love him as my own. She has a tripped planned to go meet her mom's new boyfriend, which she still goes on leaving me with her unwell cat for 5 days. She also tasks me with taking him to the vet an hour from our new house after I noticed weird signs. Plus she didn't even have enough for the vet bill! Our financially depleting account had to cover it, cause I didn't want to get in trouble for not paying for HER CAT. 


October/November 2024:

One day my partner finally approaches her BEGGING her she needs to contribute to anything at this point. He sits her down, tells her how he's been feeling, asks her how doctors visits are going, how interviews are going, expresses how he deeply wants to help her but is feeling like we are being take advantage of. She says almost nothing other than ""she is trying"" and that she ""doesn't know what we expect her to do if people don't want to hire her"". Like what? She won't take any accountability for not contributing at all! After that conversation, slams her door and posts on snap about her life being hard. 

I do 3 warnings with people usually, cause if you do it twice sure it can be a mistake, but doing it a third time and not respecting people around you makes it intentional. Especially with slamming doors like a child, so if she did it 2 more times I would snap. Mid November comes around and I approach with a similar conversation that my partner had with her almost an entire month after. She says almost the exact same thing she said to my partner except because it's me, yells this at me! She goes up the stairs laughing cause she can't   believe I brought it up again, like it isn't her problem. Once again! slams the door.


                                   Finale:


November/December 2024:

My birthday is at the end of November but most importantly this is the first visit I've been able to make since my parents moved to France in 2023. We couldn't go the years prior because of roomie fucking surprising us with having to pay her rent. This trip was for me and my brother's birthday, as our birthdays are less than 2 weeks apart we went for awhile to celebrate both. My partner coming with was massive for us too as we hadn't had a vacation together for a long time, and didn't get time away together almost ever. All the roomie had to do was watch the cats while we were gone. 

The first day we arrived we got in late but it was almost 2pm back home. I gave her a call to ask about the cats but no answer, called multiple times and nothing, so I got worried and called her sister because it was her birthday so I said happy birthday and wondered if she had heard from roomie yet? She said no so I was freaking out. I was in France, I had never left my cats before, and I couldn't casually go back home. Finally almost 45 minutes after trying to figure out if she'd fallen, maybe something happened in the bath, I got a text saying ""Everything is fine. You need to fucking chill. It isn't like I was dead."" I thought she could of been! It was 2pm why was she still asleep? Because she had been on my computer till 5am playing Sims...again I know because she didn't tell me but instead made a joke about it on her snapchat story.

We were over a week into our trip and I was spiraling with the unbelievably awful communication she was having with me about the cats and taking care of our house. It felt like pulling teeth just to hear from her. One day we went to lunch with my parents friends, who asked about roomie, we told her about the year we had with her and she openly said ""Drop her."" No hesitation at the end. ""She is a parasite to your future and your lives, you cannot take care of a leach, they will only keep using you to be fed."" And for whatever resson, that clicked something in me. I made up my mind, when we got home I was going to tell her we were moving away from her and she needed to find a new place to live.


December 2024: 

We came home to the house in decent order, still dishes in her room...and shockingly she had done the kitty litters. She asked about the trip and was acting like my best friend for about a week. Then everything changed. 

One day I wake up, go smoke a bowl together, and she goes to the washroom. I tell her I'm going for a shower and that I'll make us coffee when I'm done. I shower and go downstairs to make coffee, while I'm down there I can hear her cursing and yelling, I'm wondering what's going on till she comes down a moment later and says ""Oh you were in the shower! There's no hot water!"", I said ""Well yeah I told you I was hoping in the shower?"" She says ""No you didn't, but it's fine."" I replied ""I definitely did, I said I was going to shower and make us coffee, you knew I was making coffee but didn't hear me say I was going for a shower?"" She says, ""Whatever you definitely didn't, but it's fine I'm not mad at you."" She grabs her coffee goes upstairs and bam. Slams her god damn fucking door! Number 3. I storm upstairs open her door and yell at her ""Slam your door one more fucking time and I will yell and treat you like the child you act like!"" She scrambled to get words together like she didn't slam it or she isn't mad, but I was mad. I was fucking furious, she tried to go downstairs and slam the patio door and threaten under her breath ""I'll show you a slammed door."" I flung the patio door open and said ""Oh yeah? You're name isn't even on the lease you broke bitch, you technically don't even live here! You live here because of me! And watch me call *my partner* to come home to take all your stuff out of OUR HOME."" She finally went back upstairs and I haven't spoken a word to her since that day. 

She would live the house everyday, leaving her cats with me at home, and wouldn't come home till almost midnight. Finally I told my partner we can give her a 10 day notice to kick her out as she isn't paying rent and we have proof of how much she owes, if she didn't leave on the 10th with all her stuff, I would legally take control of her belongings so I was forcing her to leave. The date of removal was December 31st. NYE. I was thinking what a beautiful way to start the new year! Free from a parasite of a person. 


December 2025:

Finally. One year to the date of her leaving. My life has been wonderful since she left, my partner and I are happier, we both have great jobs that allow us to start saving up again. I am enjoying my NYE when I get a screenshot from a friend of roomies snapchat story saying ""One Year Free and Blessed"" and proceeds to share her story of ""resilience and giving herself grace from a toxic situation."" Saying I trapped her? And we were toxic for her? Saying we didn't give her PLENTY of grace. 

So now I sit here and write this asking. Am I the asshole for removing her from my life on NYE, so she can now use it every year to claim improvement?",3,1767328473.0,stories,1,1.0,False

**INTERLUDE: OF TRAINS AND STATION DREAMS**

I toss and turn, the pitiful excuse of a blanket over me folding in unreasonable shapes. The words of the strange old lady have been troubling me as of late, I have to admit.

In a turn of events shocking to absolutely no one who’s local to the City, the blistering heat, that was making us all sweat like hogs and coated our lives in grime, gave way to a bone chilling cold.

The once black spires are now softened by the soft blanket of snow, looking almost as though they were covered by pillows. The streets, bustling with peddlers and tourists not five days ago, are now eerily empty. Life doesn’t disappear in the City during winter, however. It moves.

Underground. I’ve alluded to the metropole’s deep underground nexus before, but I can hardly do it justice. As far I’m aware, the City holds the largest, deepest, most damp dark underground network of walkways, subterranean trains, and other such faculties.

Half of the university buildings I frequent are underground after all, and so is the library. That is to say, no one was surprised when a whole shiny new train network opened up connecting the various deep warrens of the urban ecosystem. We just didn’t think it’d be so damn weirdly inconvenient.

I’m writing all of this as I drink my deep morning coffee, the oily substance glistening with dark malice. I’m writing this because I’ve decided enough is enough. I want to know more. About what that weird old witch was saying. About the dreams I’ve been having. About everything.

And that starts with the library. If you’re looking for answers, it’s the first place to check. And so, that’s where I’m headed to. Let’s just hope I can navigate this strange new train system.

Small puffs of crystalline fog float out gently as I trek the frozen wasteland that has become the normally verdant lush greenery of the woods I live in. Luckily, one of the new stations opened less than a mile from my dwelling, so I need only to endure the ice-wrought pain for a little while.

As I step up to the rotating doors, the first mark of trouble makes itself known to me. The glass panes of which the building is made out of are wrong. I cannot exactly point out how, nor why I feel so sickeningly concerned looking at them, only that my third eye is screaming at me that I should not be here. With what little choice I have, I ignore it and use my ticket. 

Train rides underground are always a little… how would I put this…*different* ? I’m sure you know exactly what I mean. It’s one of those situations where if, and that’s a big ‘if’, you’re in the present moment, not on your phone, not reading some novel or practicing some skill, you will find yourself in some form of altered consciousness. Or rather, altered isn’t really the best way to describe this. It’s like you’re suddenly, sharply, more aware, more alert to it all. Your mind will tune in to the little things around you, the jerky, unaware movements of nearby passengers, the rapid flash of lights along the cavernous tunnel walls, the low hum of the train’s engine. 

Honestly, if anything, it feels like dreaming. It feels like all the possibilities, all of the dark and ugly truths of the world, are laid bare before you, ripe for the taking, but that you, as the magnanimous but ultimately lazy Archon that you are, decide to not take them, to let them squirm at the thought that *maybe* one day you will.

I am slowly dissolving back into my regular ego as I walk a little haggardly on the train platform. The surrounding environment takes quite a moment to register in my literally lagging brain.

The station is honestly quite beautiful, the floors are nicely carved stone blocks put in a freakishly perfect symmetry. The whole thing is maybe fifty meters long for ten meters wide. A nice little island of purity in a sea of darkness. And how true that is.

When the train I exited from departs, the large baywindows that double up as doors reveal inky blackness behind it. But as my eyes adapt to it, I can tell there’s a lot more. 

I do not know how deep underground we are, and frankly I’d rather not. But all I can see is a literal yawning abyss, a veritable grotto so wide and deep the only reason I can see the walls at all is the large floodlights parsing the place like vile mockeries of the stars.

Those lights don’t look to exist without purpose, however. Beneath them, behind the stone forests of stalactite and stalagmites, are large monstrous pieces of machinery. I can only hazard a guess as to what those behemoths are there for, but there must be some huge undertaking to be done.

I decide to follow the marked trail and walk up the stairs, having seen enough caves for the day. Unfortunately, the natural vastness was only replaced by a bureaucratic one.

What greets me the instant I push the doors at the top of the stairs is an endlessly stretching horizon of yellow carpet and cinder columns.

You know the kind. The exact type of architecture you see in buildings that are done getting installed but haven’t been furnished yet, and typically missing walls.

It’s maddening for quite a while. I know that I’m lost but I cannot even panic as I am not alone. There are dozens of people around me, all walking with determination like they know exactly where they’re going. I try asking them for help, but they end up walking around a pillar and vanishing from sight.

Thankfully, I finally found my way out of there. A minuscule green EXIT sign, only about 20 centimeters wide sitting above a nondescript single door, on a wall that appears to be sitting in the middle of more empty space. Yet, pushing it reveals the underground mall I’m used to visit while going to university. All hope is not lost yet.

As I walk with newfound determination towards my initial goal, the events that just transpired are already getting fainter in my memory, turning into a single funny anecdote to tell my friends sometime.",2,1767328172.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,2,1.0,False

(20-40 people),"I recently started a book club on Meetup and scheduled it for a large coffee shop that usually has ample space. I naively didn't put a cap on the event and ended up with WAY more sign-ups than I anticipated, and I'm nervous the coffee shop will not have enough space. (I reached out to them and they also told me there is another book club and a table top gaming group that meets there at the same time, eek!)

Wondering if anyone has any suggestions for community spaces? I looked at local libraries and all the spaces seemed a little depressing. I thought about using the grassy part of Balboa but I'm worried about rain.

Any suggestions for meeting spaces are appreciated. Ideally there would be a bathroom accessible. Nearby food or drink options and/or nice vibes would be a plus. Good parking and public transportation would also be a plus.

1q1p2k8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AuDHDWomen/comments/1q1p2k8/trigger_warning_long_discussion_of_violence/,Trigger warning: long discussion of violence during meltdown,"Hello!

I’m not super sure how to articulate this. My thoughts are scattered and I feel like this is the last place I need to apologize for that so I am just gonna go for it.

I am 45 and while I have had many meltdowns without incident, I am horrified to admit that I have been physically violent a few times. In discussion with my mom this evening, we estimated about 5 times total in my lifetime. Verbal violence was something I used to do much more in my 20’s and 30’s during heated arguments or when people would break up with me. It is extremely rare for me at this point in my life to even look sideways at someone. It’s my baseline, not something I really have to work at. I hate confrontation and violence makes me very uncomfortable. 

I m not saying this to deflect these actions, I want to add this in hopes maybe someone else will recognize this. Because I think that’s what makes this so scary for me. When I have these episodes of violence, I do not have control over myself and so when I do lash out it makes it even more upsetting to those around me because it is NOT something that people expect me to do, if that makes sense.. 

My husband has been on the receiving end of a few of my meltdowns that involved some verbal insults, especially when we first began dating over 15 years ago, for the first two years ,but I have not been that way since.

He is a loving and wonderful man and we rarely fight. We have a boring nice life because he has dedicated everything he can to help me life the life I want. He works hard so I can choose my hours. He feeds me and gives me any and everything I want. He will stop at nothing to help me with my AuDHD struggles. I’ve been in therapy for about 7 years. I’ve done ketamine and EMDR therapy for treatment resistant depression and PTSD. I am medicated for ADHD. 

I had a complete hysterectomy and so menopause changed everything for me. It’s been the worst thing I’ve ever experienced. I had massive skill regression, 6 years of burnout, two years of that my broken body slept on this ottoman in my living room for almost two years straight. I was up to eat and go to the doctor but that’s about it. He stayed with me through it all. 

I’m slowly getting involved in life again, For example, I’ve joined a political campaign, started some art projects, and began to be more social. 

But I am having difficulty being vulnerable with the team. I don’t get along well with them, and I know so little about local politics that it just is so overwhelming at times. I just tell myself that growing and learning is uncomfortable and that I just need to keep at it.

I am responsible for the upkeep of the house, and it’s constant. I can’t catch up because I’ve been sick with a major UTI that won’t clear and pancreatitis. I have Ehlers - Danlos that is flaring all the time anymore. It’s so much pain and my family doctor is not familiar with it. I live in a rural area so there are no resources really. My ancient cat is dying. My best friend is an old ass grumpy man with CTE and he is so hard to be around. We got into a fight today over whatever I can’t even remember. 

My family is crazy. And good goddess, the news is just so triggering. Today the first thing I saw was the Epstein story about ordering two 8 year old girls. It triggers me so much and I probably sound like a weenie girl, but it just does.

I’ve got a news article due and some paperwork due by the weekend. I also have misophonia and it’s getting worse and worse as I age.

We had a family member die by suicide 3 months ago and the holidays were very hard. I have insomnia and haven’t slept proper in months, none at all in two days. I’m exhausted and I did not listen to my body. 

Tonite I had a meltdown, blacked out, and I threw a coffee mug in the room. It wasn’t thrown at my husband directly but it was very sudden and it broke, so I know I had to have thrown it very hard. I think it was luck I did not hurt him or any of my dogs or cats because I just threw it without any concern.

I ended up cutting myself and not realizing it during the meltdown and so he called to get help because the blood was everywhere.

My mother came and got me reoriented. My husband is understandably upset and we have talked about what happened but he is not mad or planning to leave. This was the first time he ever witnessed this level of meltdown where I blacked out and lost memory.

I am not sure what I am looking for. I am so deeply ashamed and embarrassed. I told my husband that I would understand if he felt it was best to leave. Because if I am honest, I don’t know that it will never happen again and I consider it to be domestic abuse. It’s very painful to have this piece of me that is against everything I believe and stand for. If my friends came to me and said their partner did what I did I would tell them to leave! 

My mom, bless her heart, tries to point out that it’s just a small piece of who I am and that everyone around me knows that I am benevolent 99.9999 percent of the time. 

But look at this:
When I was a teenager, I had a meltdown and got physically violent by kicking the front seat very hard and repeatedly from the back seat. I once hit my brother in the face with a golf club during a meltdown when I was 10 or so. And then I threw a soup can once at a longtime friend. I have been verbally harsh to my mother once recently, but it was more or less about sexual abuse I suffered as a child by my biological father and some things she said that led me to believe she did not believe Epstein victims. 

But when I look at that I feel like I’m a dangerous POS.

(with kids),"When is it ok to be open to dating after divorce? My three-year-long divorce was final last year, and I’ve started really enjoying life again. I haven’t been on a date in the time since I filed for divorce three years ago. 

For a while, I'd thought about messaging a guy I dated in high school who moved out of state. I really like him and was sad when he moved. He moved back a few years ago and I've been curious to see how he's been doing. Today, I decided just to send him a message asking how he is.  He got back and said he's well and asked me the same. That's it. I was just curious and figured, why not?

But I mentioned it to mom, and she said  it’s too soon. I just messaged him that’s it. I might get coffee to catch up if we've been messaging long enough, but I'm not thinking about a relationship. I don't ever want to rush it. She also said she would worry about how it would impact my kids. We're not getting married! It's just a message and a possible coffee date. She also said she worries my ex would find out and then take it out on our kids. I can't make every decision in my personal life based on what he might do.

Now, I'm not sure. I feel very good in my life and don't want to shut myself off from ever even going on a simple date.  I'd never want to jeopardize the well being of my kids. I wouldn't even get serious with anyone easily. I just don't see how just a casual message is an issue. Was I wrong to start being open to dating again? ",1,1767328111.0,Divorce,5,1.0,False

When I interviewed they said hostess lunch shifts were 11am-4pm and dinner was 4-9pm. Both of those worked fine for my school schedule as classes were usually in the morning and I could do my homework before or after the shift.

This was NOT the case at all!! They would keep you until they ""cut"" you. If I worked an evening shift they would keep me until 11pm or 12am to bus tables because everyone came in at 9 for half priced apps and drinks.  And I was always scheduled every Friday and Saturday night and Sunday lunch. And if I was serving after my 7 hour shift was over I still had to clean all the tables. Trying to sweep crumbs up with a broom on carpet was absolutely miserable! This was not sustainable while going to school. I was an absolute zombie. I was working 2-3 weekdays from 4 or 5pm until midnight, getting up for school at 7am and classes went until 12 or 1pm. That gave me 3 hours before I had to go to work which I usually needed a nap. And on top of that I worked every weekend so had zero time to do anything or relax. I also lost a ton of weight because I was napping instead of eating lunch or eating something small right before work because the shift was 5-12pm so when was I going to eat a proper meal?

It's been over 10 years and this still bothers me. I only worked there for a year and then I worked at a coffee shop where they ACTUALLY let me leave when my shift was done. If there was a huge rush right when I was done I would stay 10min or so to help but it's not 3 extra hours.
