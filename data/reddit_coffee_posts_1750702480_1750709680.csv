* **Anime**: Currently watching The Apothecary Diaries, feels like there hasn't been much on this season. Let's chat about our favourite anime and exchange recommendations?
* **Lego**: Architecture, Star Wars and anything else that's cool to display. I may or may not be planning to have a Lego room in my next house
* **TCGs**: Pokemon and classic Digimon card collector, against my better judgment I'm thinking of getting back into Yu-Gi-Oh!
* **Archery**: I shoot at things, sometimes I hit them
* **DIY**: Bought a house 2 years ago, and might have finally run out of DIY. You get bonus points if you correctly guess how many holes the previous owners drilled for a single shelf
* **Pianist**: Occasionally the noises I make sound like anime songs
* **Reading**: I'm in my psychology/mental health/self-development/productivity phase. The Solo Leveling omnibus novel is also looking at me menacingly
* **Technology**: A general interest in computers, which ranges from gaming to building computers to home servers. And my day job is hacking
* **Sci-Fi and Fantasy**: The usual culprits like Star Wars and Lord of the Rings
* **Japanese**: Plan to travel to Japan one day and would like to be at least conversationally proficient
* **Being a functional adult**: Cooking, cleaning, ironing, I can do it all. If I don't know something, I'll go learn
* Making lists and collecting hobbies...

About me:

* White, British, 6'2"" with a slim build. Open to exchanging photos as we get to know each other
* I live in Hampshire. Open to long distance if there's potential to meet eventually and we put the effort into making it work
* Non-smoker and I don't drink. I generally prefer days out and nights in
* I'm open to having children but it'll need to be a ""hell yes"", equally fine never having kids. My focus right now is on finding someone I'd want to spend the rest of my life with
* I'm a big texter but also up for calls and video chats when we're comfortable with each other
* Don't really have just one love language, I'm physically affectionate and a big fan of holding hands when out and about. Quality time together and words of affirmation are also ways to my heart. I express my love with a bit of everything
* I'd describe myself as quite ambitious, always striving to be better. I also (usually) know when to slow down
* Not into alcoholic, hot or fizzy drinks. So when I propose coffee and cake for our first date, just know I'll actually be drinking apple juice. Walks in the part to feed ducks and other casual activity dates also welcome. Or we can just skip to doing a couples cosplay at comic con

Thoughts on relationships:

* Smoking, vaping and drugs are dealbreakers
* Looking for someone at a similar stage in life and generally set my age preference on dating sites to 25 - 33. Not a dealbreaker though if the vibe is good
* I'm open to chatting with people outside the UK, but my expectations of it turning into anything serious are low. Feel free to try convince me otherwise, but you'll have to put a lot of effort in
* Communication is really important to me and something I actively want to get better at as well. Low effort first messages are unlikely to get a reply. Prove to me you've actually read my post. Conversely, high effort first messages are basically guaranteed to get us chatting
* Some shared hobbies and values are nice but I also want to know what you're into. It's expected that part of being in a relationship is doing your own thing, but spending time together on shared hobbies is nice as well
* I'm a complete person and hopefully so are you. Together, we could be more than the sum of our parts

1lir0fz,https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/1lir0fz/why_does_major_kira_drink_earth_coffee/,why does Major Kira drink Earth coffee?,"hello fellow trekkies,
long time lurker, first time poster here

I’m watching DS9 for the first time, and I keep thinking about the opening to S3E8: Meridian. 
Kira sits down with a freshly replicated cup after burning her mouth and says to Odo “Coffee should be a little too hot to drink right away.” She talks about slowing down the experience and savoring the taste. This suggests a regular familiarity with coffee as a ritual to start the workday. As a coffee drinker myself I agree with her point, but how is she so used to this piece of human culture? 

Is it Bajoran coffee? Is it Raktajino? (if so, same question about Bajoran connection to beta quadrant culture. unless Sisko introduced her to she stuff.)
We don’t hear her order to the replicator, but if she’s using the english word for the drink I imagine it’s our coffee —especially since we know how O’brien orders his. 

I know it’s a tiny line mainly there to showcase Odo’s alien experience, but I keep musing about the in-universe implications of Kira’s human coffee routine and would love to hear any thoughts or fan theories. I love how many star trek characters routinely enjoy the comfort of their hot drink of choice, and I need to know more about Kira’s.",1,1750709413.0,startrek,4,0.6,False

The Day of the Phantom Tickets
Today felt like I did nothing. Like… maybe helped two people, tops. And while I genuinely like my job and my shift, having nothing to do kinda messes with your brain. It’s weirdly harder than being busy. But hey—I’m still getting paid, and it’s not like the job is physically demanding. So I’ll keep sipping my coffee and pretending I’m not checking the clock every 10 minutes.

RIP CSA Thursdays
Big update from the team meeting: the CSA team is officially dead as of Thursday. Every single one of them is getting shuffled off to other teams. Which means if a ticket comes in that we (IT desk) can’t fix… well, the user’s basically SOL. Great planning, right?

To make it better, we’re now being asked to support tickets from other parts of Mosaic Health—but we don’t have access to any of their systems. We can reset Microsoft passwords through Entra… and that’s it. No Athena, no remote access, no software insight, no matching laptops. Just vibes.

I’m not even being dramatic—we literally have zero plan, no training, no access, and no gear to do the job. So when someone from the other orgs calls in, I guess we just say, “Have you tried sacrificing a goat to the IT gods?” because that’s about as useful as we’ll be.

The Athena Training Black Hole
Still no real news on Athena training. It’s allegedly happening next month, but we’re running out of CSAs to ask questions to. So if I sound calm, just know it’s because I’ve emotionally disassociated like a true professional.

But On the Bright Side...
I had onboarding training with Ezra again today—dude’s chill as hell and just kind of floats through life the same way I try to. Makes it easier to stay grounded when you see someone else not losing their mind.

Also came up with 6 new emoji automation ideas that I’m gonna build out tomorrow. They should make life easier for everyone on the helpdesk. Shoutout to one of the coworkers for giving me the spark—I’m also now fixated on this “template” idea. Not sure how I want to use it yet, but I think it has big potential for ticket replies, help requests, or pre-filled user messages. Just gotta mold it into something useful.


---

Final Thought
If I can just survive the next 6 months without getting thrown under the bus or drowned in unsupported tickets, I think I’ll come out of this whole merger madness in a really solid spot. Until then… deep breaths, emojis, and coffee.",1,1750709384.0,u_moodoo976,0,1.0,False

*We know him the least*

*We are wary of him the most*

The gentle rustle of leaves filled the air as a boy moved through the drills. He was fast—faster than the others his age—but still sloppy in his footwork. He lacked discipline, was not part of the academy but his enthusiasm made up for it.

His mind wandered.

His grudge for ninjas had pushed him to that.

It had been simple. Too simple.

*A minor change—a shift altered, a team switched.*

No one questioned it. Why would they?

The schedule had always been meticulous, but even the most diligent ninjas overlooked minor clerical errors. Who would notice a single change on the duty roster, buried beneath the many pages of administrative work?

He hadn’t been there when the blade was drawn. There was no need to stain his hands with blood. Someone else could do it.

The man refocused. He continued looking at son.

**He hated ninjas.**

zzz

**The second killer is his predecessor's grandson**

*We fear him the least*

*We are scared of his potential the most*

Laughter filled the park as the two boys dashed through the grass, their sandals kicking up small clouds of dust. The sun was high, casting warm rays over the village, but they didn’t care about the heat. Not when there was a race to win.

He lost, intentionally. He was in a good mood after all. It wasn’t hard to act like an ordinary kid. Because he was one.

Mostly.

Except for when his friend told him to do something.

*Convincing his grandfather had been easy. It always was. A bright smile, an innocent request, just like he was told.*

*So, of course, his grandfather had gone. Had walked right to the secretary, carrying a small bag of wooden toys in one hand and a warm chuckle in his throat.*

*The weren't allowed to enter the office. He knew but...*

*A petulant whine, some spilled coffee, a distraction.*

*Just enough time.*

*The key had been at the drawer, the same place he left the fake one. And just like that, the pieces had moved into place.*

*He had no idea what he did. No idea what he helped plan.*

*He just did what he was told and it just happened that some days later, someone was assassinated.*

He sat up, brushing dirt from his clothes. His friend was on the ground now, dreaming.

**Konohamaru hated ninjas.**

zzz

**The third killer is his son's best friend**

*We trust him the least*

*We hate him the most*

The house was quiet, save for the muffled sobs coming from the next room. He stood in the doorway, watching as his best friend embraced his brother, his fingers gripping his shirts like he might disappear if he let go.

He wished he could say something. Do something.

*He barely felt the other one in the room. The one who shouldn't have been there.*

*Ninjas kept coming in and out. But he remained, hidden from the others in the room.*

*The first explosion was heard throughout the village. The village's leader turned to the window. No orders for him yet.*

*The second and the third.*

*The fourth.*

*A big smoke coming from his clan compound. This time he dropped down on his own.*

*Him and his team ordered to investigate. Investigate the explosions that he planted.*

*A last look at his leader. This was his last chance.*

***""You know what happens if you tell? You know what happens if I even fail?""***

*He wanted to deceive himself, to believe he was being blackmailed—but deep down, he knew it had been his choice all along.*

*He left. His best friend's father and his assassin, the last people in the room.*

He went to comfort them, their father's blood in his hands.

**Shisui started hating ninjas.**

zzz

**The fourth killer is his old rival's son**

Even in the morning, the ramen shop was as lively as it is in the evening, yet a small space had naturally formed around him—a bubble of distance that no one wanted to cross.

He didn’t mind. He preferred it that way.

He didn't like ninjas, wasn’t one and never wanted to be. He had no village pride, just another person sitting at the ramen bar, passing the time.

A strange sight for anyone who knew him as a newspaper rested on the table, its pages slightly crinkled from wear. He wasn’t one to read the news—never had been—but today was different. If anyone cared to look closely, they’d notice something even stranger.

It wasn’t today’s newspaper.

It wasn’t even this week’s.

Last week’s headlines stared back at him, the inked words old but still holding weight.

He smiled.

""Keep ’em coming, Teuchi,"" he said, placing his empty bowl of what was seafood ramen onto the counter. ""I'm in a good mood today"".

The old man chuckled, already preparing another serving. ""You got it, kid.""

He traced the edge of the paper with his thumb, many news spread out on the page, but he had never seen a bigger headline before.

Naruto kept smiling. He despised his village.

1liqyv1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1liqyv1,Elmer—one of the best graphic novels,"*Elmer* (2006-2008) by Filipino author Gerry Alanguilan is one of the best graphic novels I’ve ever read.

With its unique premise, dynamic plot, and bold ideas, it is everything I love about great comics—it’s political.

Imagine a world where chickens, in a clear nod to George Orwell’s *Animal Farm* and Art Spiegelman's *Maus*,, suddenly gain consciousness.

They drink coffee. They go to work. They star in movies. In short, chickens are treated just like humans. Well, almost.

Chickens get aroused by humans. They masturbate to humans. Chickens and humans even get engaged and married.

But both humans and chickens still eat ducks. And just like humans, chickens can also be a little homophobic.

The story is told through the memoirs of the protagonist’s father—a first-generation conscious chicken who fought for change.

*Elmer* is a story of memory, family, and the slow fading of elderly parents. It’s about dealing with trauma—because, as you can imagine, chickens in the human world have a lot of trauma to deal with.

It’s about how it is important not to forget. The horrors of poultry farms where they became sentient. Electrocuted. Decapitated. Where they fought back. And the ensuing genocide (or gallocide?) as people tried to eradicate the intelligent fowl, calling it culling. The murderous mobs of ignorant, scared people. The rooster terrorists.

And then, the eventual recognition of chicken equality—UN resolutions and all—followed by yet another genocide.

A lot of heavy topics here: xenophobia, faith, religion, cultural shifts, and the boundaries of humanity.

Although written in English, it is also unmistakably Filipino. Set in the lush Philippine landscape, it’s filled with cockfighting arenas, farmers wielding bolos, barongs, rice. And “the fucking banana ketchup”.

One joke hinges on knowing that chicken in Tagalog is manok—the title of a fictional movie about a chicken who is also a man.

your laugh compressed, auto-uplift.  
Torch your mind, but keep the shell —

This [article from Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/blog/know-your-audience) breaks down why knowing your target audience is key to successful marketing, product development, and differentiation. Through methods like surveys, buyer personas, social listening, and even monitoring competitors, businesses can understand what their audience values, how they communicate, and what unmet needs they have. The payoff? More tailored messaging, stronger relationships, and smarter product decisions.

The piece also highlights success stories from Lulus and Propeller Coffee. Lulus used customer feedback to guide product choices and even expanded into physical retail, while Propeller focused on customization, letting user behavior shape their offerings.

1liqsri,https://www.reddit.com/r/VanLife/comments/1liqsri/hydronic_heating_for_hot_drinking_water/,Hydronic heating for hot drinking water?,"I'm considering a hydronic heating system (e.g. Rixens) for a camper van build and I am wondering whether I can use it for cooking water as well, and if so what would be the best approach for this. For example, if I want to boil water for coffee or stew it would require less energy to boil already-hot water from the hydronic heating system than to boil room temperature water.   
  
At first, the solution seems simple, but my understanding (perhaps incorrect) is:  
1) It is not good for the drinking-water filter to run the hot water (i.e. post-heat-exchanger) through the filter. Instead only room temp water should go through the filter.   
2) I don't want to run all my water (e.g. shower and dish cleaning) through the filter. I understand some people might do that but I don't see this as necessary and it will significantly overuse the filter.

Assuming the above 2 constraints, I don't think you can simply conditionally run the water through the filter and then through the same heat exchanger as the non-filtered water, as there would be backfill of non-filtered water after each switch over. So the only solution that comes to mind is to use a 2nd heat exchanger, just like the first, but specifically for drinking water. I'm not sure whether that is a good or bad idea. Or perhaps there is a more elegant solution. I have done some searching online but haven't come across this specific use case yet. 

If anyone has any insight or ideas around this they would be appreciated. And in case hydronic heating in general is a controversial topic in general, perhaps we can keep ""should I even have hydronic heating?"" out of scope in this discussion :)",1,1750708918.0,VanLife,0,1.0,False

I'm Troy Aikins, indie author of a new YA contemporary series that starts with Botany with Friends: Fall Semester —a high school story where friendship, plants, and sarcastic coffee mugs grow side by side (with the occasional garden plot rivalry and disaster, of course).

🪴 What it’s about:
Fourteen-year-olds are tossed into an experimental botany class where they don’t know each other, don’t want to work together, and definitely don’t expect to care this much about plants.
But with group gardening assignments, compost debates, sabotage suspicions, and teachers who never stop sipping weirdly punny coffee mugs… they’re in for a semester that’s more chaotic than calming.

No magic. No romance. Just real growth—emotionally and horticulturally.

💡 Includes:

76 chapters of character-driven chaos

Group dynamics that evolve realistically

Gardening facts and seasonal history baked in

Eccentric teachers who somehow keep it all together

A classroom that feels like home… once you earn it


📖 Perfect for fans of:

Dry humor

Realistic school settings

Ensemble cast stories

Students figuring themselves out without easy answers

I will just mention a few things they do:

-They always forget when it’s their turn to clean the washroom so I always have to remind them and it’s sort of annoying because if I don’t do that, the washroom won’t be cleaned, the see that it’s a total mess yet they won’t do it.

-Also, they never take out the trash. They can see that the trash cans are absolutely full and yet they don’t do it, they see me taking out the bags every week but don’t mention anything about it.

-They leave a lot of food in the fridge to rot so I have to take care of that.

- If they get the microwave dirty, they don’t clean it, just like when they cook on the stove or on the oven they always leave it stained.

- They leave dirty napkins and bags around and if they leave stains of coffee on the table I’m the one cleaning it.

I’m sort of tired of this because now I feel like a maid when this is supposed to be my house as well. When I spoke about this with my mother, she said that if that person is not going to do it, I should do it for my own sake and my own mental health but today there was something that completely cracked me down and it was something that they left on the bathtub that I found completely disgusting. 

They know this sort of things affect me personally and they don’t do what I ask and I’m sort of tired because if these are spaces that we both share, they should be respected. I want to be able to feel comfortable in my own house, but I sometimes just stay in my room just not to see the mess that they leave behind.

To be fair, I was raised in a household where everything had to stay clean and organized bc my mom has OCD so I’m used to it, however I do know that not everyone is like me so I try to be as tolerant and accepting as I can but I feel like it’s gotten to a point where this is stressing me out.

I just want to clarify that I love my best friend to bits and they’re great. They are an amazing person that has been there for me through my worst times, but I also feel like right now for me being in my house is sort of stressing and I don’t wanna be rude or anything, but I’m not sure of how to deal with this since they are the kind of person that take things personal when you communicate to them something that it’s bothering you, I know I have to put some limits, but I really don’t know how to do it without making the house situation sort of tense.",1,1750708668.0,AmIOverreacting,5,1.0,False

I've been bearing myself up about the state of my apartment for months and really need to deal with it now..

My priorities are:
1. Unearthing my bed area which is surrounded by general messiness and laundry 
2. Getting couch area clean and comfy again; there's a big pile of recycling next to it coffee table height that just makes me want to cry. Plus my coffee table itself is covered in crap as is every surface around my couch. 
3. Getting kitchen to a place I can have someone come over to finish up. There's a fruit fly infestation because I started cleaning it out but had a bad pain flare and couldn't get the trash with food in it to the dumpster. I don't think a general cleaner would be able to handle this mess because of the flies..

Does anyone have any tips or words of encouragement to help me battle my own brain and the timeline? I deal with so much shame around this. My biggest issue is not being able to take multiple trips downstairs to my building's dumpsters because it's painful for me and I have to rest between trips. If I could just get my place reset I could maybe afford a once weekly cleaner to help with the things I struggle with before they snowball.

The first one that actually worked for me without a headache was Surfshark. I liked that it didn’t feel complicated. Just one click and it connected. I used it while I was at a coffee shop and the WiFi there was sketchy but Surfshark didn’t slow things down much and I still felt safe browsing and checking my bank app

Later on I tried NordVPN because people kept recommending it. The map feature looked weird at first but I ended up liking it a lot. It was kind of fun just clicking on a location to connect and the speeds were better especially when streaming

If you're just starting out like I was the best thing is to try a VPN that keeps it simple. Look for something that doesn't throw too many options at you and has good support if you get stuck.

melbourne - i was told is more a city vibe? what are some solo things i should do here? luckily the wedding is here so should be able to be social with some friends

As nice as it would be to move to a larger market city where there's more work, I don't really have enough money to facilitate something like that comfortably. Figured I could just move back in with parents for a year or two to get financial footing in order.

How should I continue to network with the firms in my city for when something may become available, without seeming overly desperate for a position? Don't just want to follow up a blitz of cold calls with requests for coffee chats this soon lol.

Anything else I should actually be doing in the meantime, ARE prep things, or redoing portfolio work/etc?

Happy to say the compost is composting and the worms are incredibly happy!

What I’m adding in: finely chopped kitchen scraps, brown leaves, shreds of cardboard, urine, coffee grounds, old dirt from planters and the garden, water. 

I’ll usually toss everything, dig a deep hole, put some worms and garden scraps in, cover with said materials above, water the whole thing down, cover with a black plastic tarp and secure with bricks atop.

1liqd0t,https://www.reddit.com/r/enlightenment/comments/1liqd0t/i_am_in_a_thought_loop_because_i_desire_to_be/,I am in a thought loop because I desire to be hyperproductive a lot,"I'm now on my second cup of coffee today because I want to caffeinate to activate the ultimate mindset that will allow me to be hyperproductive and summon inner heightened abilities and thus have in a few areas very heightened abilities than normal because of my mental state. I've taken an extremely well deserved rest after playing over a week on Spore just building an empire and destroying the Grox, but mainly watching cartoons and now I want to be hyperproductive and do lots of things.

My caffeine assumption this evening is definitely out of sheer impulse rather than being in my senses because of my urge to have caffeine in order to become a hyperproductive machine that's machines have all been assembled.

Therefore I've gotten myself in a thought loop where I keep thinking to myself that I am going to have a high mood and I'm going to be hyperproductive and unlock an ultra omega mindset to do it and that I'm going to laser focus on my work and how I'm going to be amazing, I'm going to be awesome, I'm going to be the best, I'm going to be unstoppable. I'm going to put myself in deep state flow which goes along with such a mindset because I quote from the last time someone spotted my deep state flow years ago, ""it blocks the mind, the body, and the spirit,"" they had a religious, Christian interpretation of the state but I don't because though I have my religious beliefs I don't find the religious outlook useful or good for almost most things and prefer the materialistic and scientific and careful focus on the details approach. The deep state flow is a combination of losing your sense of slowing down as you are going at maximum power and maximum speed at everything whilst at the same time being laser focused on being a good person becausee you want to be a good person and be in control that much that even in the most seemingly out of hand state a person can be in you have somehow the senses to be in control of everything because you desire to be in control that much and therefore someone telling you you are manic is something you immediately accept because you are thinking, ""yes that's definitely me right now."" 

I'm also thinking stuff like I think of my brain as speeding up and the processing ticks, the CPU is running at an increasingly higher clock rate and the more ticks that occur the more ticks that will occur and it is only a matter of time even though there isn't evidence that my brain is speeding up particularly fast but it's just that I feel hyped on being hyperproductive so I'm in a thought loop to become hyperproductive and fast. I currently want to read philosophy books since I'm a huge philosophy nerd and philosophy is my special interest and build new stuff in Minecraft and do art, that's what I have in mind. I also have in mind writing this out just so I have somewhere to express my thoughts. 

And anyway another factor in my deep state flow happening is because in this mental state I desire to become omnibenevolent and be purified of all desires that are harmful and therefore I end up thinking to myself that I most become the gentlest and kindest possible that I can be and therefore you can see where this is going I would hope to think. Maybe I'll get lots of ideas and write them down in a document, just a cluster of brainstorming ideas, they don't have to be good or high quality, and anyway I know from experience that when your brain goes very fast and faster and faster it just means you are stupid very fast and you can be extremely stupid extremely fast. Sometimes being extremely slow is actually being an absolute genius as you come up with one ingenious, unbelievable thing and it knocks the floor really hard. Just saying. I'm saying that to put a positive account of thinking slowly since there are people who can feel like they can't keep up with the demanding pace of the modern world. It's ridiculous. I don't think I can keep up with the pace of the modern world at my fastest, if I were going faster, I don't feel like I'm going that much faster than I usually am but that's because my brain isn't like racing it's more like coming up with thought after thought as I write this like a glorified diary entry to be seen by complete I am enlightened heads with a high opinion of their level of enlightenment and their tendency to write like their spreading Guru wisdoms on the populace. It's no fault of this type of subreddit because frankly it's like yeah it will attract those people who want to express that perspective on the world but I would say it is best not to take ourselves too seriously. I'm going to get many downvotes for saying this so I'm going to brace myself. 

As of writing this now at this moment at this point in the post I had my coffee and it did barely anything. This is what happens when your caffeine tolerance is too high. Maybe it did do something that is hidden from my consciousness, yes likely very likely yes. 

Basically I needed to express the thought loop I was in, my deep desire to be hyperproductive and start doing that now and the way that my brain works and how it behaves when it decides it's time to go very fast and do lots of work and be hyper and be hyped up on life and become the happiest person in the entire world, I just wrote that now because basically I felt an internal sense of hype flowing through my veins, I would describe myself as hyped. 

Thank you for listening. If you have any advice give it here. If you know where I can find excellent audio for new stuff to learn that can be anything because I'm interested in everything also share here because I can listen to a fascinating subject whilst building in Minecraft and being an artist.

# Deer Repellent Tips

While any of these homemade deer repellents can be used immediately, they will be more potent if left to ripen at room temperature for 24 hours. It will stink, that’s the point.

When you’re ready to spray your plants, make sure it’s dry and you spray the entire plant—leaves, stems, fruits, and all. The recipes won’t harm your foliage, and the odor should go away once the spray dries, but it will still be unpleasant to those trying to eat it. If a bite is taken, the spicy pepper gives off a burning warning.

After spraying your garden, pour any remaining mixture back into a sealable jug for storage. As the eggs and milk continue to rot, it will get even more potent! Reapply the repellent weekly and after any rainfall. Once you make your yard unappetizing, deer are more likely to find somewhere else to eat.",2,1750707684.0,gardening,0,1.0,False

Alright friends, let’s get real for a second. Have you ever found yourself lost in a sea of content ideas, staring at a blank screen, and feeling like you just wasted a solid hour (or two)? 😩 Yup, we've all been there. But guess what? The golden age of AI tools is here, and if you’re not onboard yet, you *will* be kicking yourself when everyone else is riding the wave of content success! 🌊

Here’s the lowdown: **working smarter, not harder** is the name of the game. So, let's break it down! 

**Why AI Tools?** 
- **Efficiency:** They take care of the grunt work so you can focus on the fun stuff—like being creative! 
- **Boost Creativity:** Sometimes you just need a little nudge in the right direction. AI can help spark those brilliant ideas. 
- **Stay Relevant:** The content world is moving fast, and these tools can help keep you in the loop. 

**Top AI Tools to Check Out:**
1. **Copy.ai:** Need a snazzy copy for your new blog post? This bad boy can whip up ideas like a magician! 🎩✨
2. **Canva with AI Features:** Ever tried designing with AI? It's a game-changer. Seriously, you can create stunning graphics in less time than it takes to brew your morning coffee.
3. **Jasper:** It’s like having a super knowledgeable friend who’s always down to brainstorm. Perfect for crafting engaging content.

**Quick Tips for Beginners:**
- **Start Small:** Test one tool at a time. Don’t overwhelm yourself!
- **Embrace the Imperfection:** The first draft produced by an AI isn't going to be Pulitzer-worthy—but that's okay. It’s a draft, not your final masterpiece! 
- **Iterate:** Think of AI as your friendly collaborator. You can always tweak and refine to match *your* voice.

And here’s the kicker: **Time is money** and if you’re doing everything the old-fashioned way, you’re losing both! Don't let the gold rush pass you by while you’re still digging with a shovel when everyone else has a bulldozer. 🥴

I remember when I first dabbled in AI tools. I was skeptical. What if they took away my “creative spark”? But honestly, they *enhanced* it! Just the other day, I needed ideas for social media posts, and instead of scrolling endlessly, I let Jasper take the wheel. Boom! In minutes, I had a solid week’s worth of engaging posts lined up.

So, what about you? Which AI tool have you been eyeing, or which have you already tried? Let’s swap tips, experiences, and maybe some laughs over those epic fails we’ve all definitely had!

To my friends and family who are members of the LDS Church—please read this with love. 

These are thoughts and feelings I’ve wanted to share for a long time. And I feel it is important for you to read them.

I want to start by saying I love you. Truly. This post comes from a place of wanting connection, not conflict.

If you are someone who is still in the Church, and you’ve ever invited someone who has stepped away to “come back,” whether that’s through an activity, a sacrament meeting, a conference, or just “coming to Christ” again—I want to ask you to pause and reflect on something:

Have you ever asked that person why they left?

If you haven’t—even once—it might feel to them like you’re not trying to understand them. It might feel like you’re saying, “I don’t accept who you are now. I liked you better when you were like me.”

That’s not how connection grows. That’s how distance grows.

Most people who leave the Church do so after a long, hard, and deeply thoughtful process. It’s rarely about being offended or wanting to sin. It’s about conscience, pain, integrity, and personal wrestles that go far deeper than most people assume.

So when you make a little joke—like “you did that on a Sunday, so now it’s cursed,” or “you’d sell yourself for a nickel,” or “oh no, coffee?”—please know: those moments hurt.

They minimize something sacred to us: our journey. Our becoming.

Imagine if I poked at your faith with the same tone. Imagine if I made a joke about the temple or your covenants. You’d feel disrespected—because those things matter to you. Just like our journey out matters to us.

So here’s what I ask: before you invite someone back, invite them into a conversation.

Ask why they left. Ask what they’ve learned. Try to understand—not to convince, but to connect. That’s the kind of relationship where both people grow.

I say this with love, and hope, and a genuine desire to keep bridges strong.

Love doesn’t require agreement. But it does require effort.",12,1750707394.0,exmormon,0,1.0,False

I’ve (37m) been dealing with Diarrhea for over a year now. I’ve been experimenting with the generic Metamucil Premium (stevia) and whole psyllium husks. I take them in the evening after eating dinner. This has helped immensely - because it usually produces a large (but very soft) BM in the morning after some coffee. When this happens I feel emptied out and I’m usually good for the day. There are negatives though. If I don’t time my coffee right or eat breakfast, I can get the urge when I’m not home. It is hard to fight and I get 10min max before an accident.

I’ve never tried Citrucel before. I’m interested to see if it might work similar to psyllium but form a firmer stool that I can actually hold a while if needed…

When I go to work, I’ve been relying on Loperamide (Imodium) to get through the day. But over the last year I’ve gone from 1 pill to 4 pills for the same effect. I need to find another solution before my immodium tolerance gets to a point it stops working.

One of my biggest passions in life is sitting cafes to waste away time (I’m also Eastern European, it’s part of my culture). 

Since moving here, I’ve been struggling to find a l cafe that:
1) actually has indoor seating (I’m always too cold to sit outside
2) has good matcha lattes (I’m not a drip coffee girl and never will be) or cappuccinos 
3) is modern and cute

I really like snowbird and Breadbelly (vibe and food), but they don’t have seating. I’m not a Beanery or Peet’s coffee fan if you get what I’m saying. 

And before anyone accuses me, I’m not looking to post up for super long with my laptop and just order tea. I’m looking for a place where I can catch up w a friend or read/journal for an hour (and I always tip more if I’m hanging).

1liq1uz,https://www.reddit.com/r/expats/comments/1liq1uz/husband_has_itchy_legs_cant_stay_home_much/,Husband has itchy legs can’t stay home much.,"So my husband and I were dating long distance for about a year before he flew 10k miles away to meet me. Then he broke up with me the second day he was back in his home country.
Then we had a phase where we talked to each other every day on the phone and became friends, then I flew there to give myself a closure, then he proposed.
Fast forward, he moved to my homecountry 5 months after that (so we were 2 years long distance in total), he worked remote (night time due to time zone difference) for about 2 years, then both of us got laid off when we had our newborn son.
He blamed me for not wanting to have a nanny (we did have 4 nannies on trial, all failed miserably) and then tagged along on my business ventures, which he got mad about a lot because he does things certain ways, disregarding my 15 years of career experience and legal obligations as the director of the company. He has rarely been home during the day as he’s hopping coffee shops to do some programming (he had at least 5 different projects he’d worked on since he moved here, none of them was ever completed).

When our son was a newborn, he didn’t do well mentally. He could not deal with the crying, and he flipped out A LOT. He had more sleep than I did, yet complained about how tiring it was. He had joint issues and holding a 5 kg baby for an hour hurt his arms. I had a c-section surgery and was pumping breast milk every 2 hours, and had to do the feeding, bottle washing, laundry, ordering food, cleaning the house because we didn’t have a fixed helper back then since he hates having a helper in the house for too long cause he wouldn’t be able to walk around in his underwear. I had chapped hands and I lost 20 kg within a month of having our bundle of joy due to physical exertion and not being able to eat or drink. Our son was a colic baby too, he couldn’t be put down otherwise he would cry so hard.

Ever since our son turned 1 and could walk, he would play with him more. He still goes out to do programming for 2-3 hours, 3x a day, but he would come home during the breaks and play with our son. This past month he helps with the morning diaper change too.

But it is a lonely marriage from Day 1.
We were not in the same space a lot. He was always out a lot. It was worse when I asked him if he’s been talking to this particular person (he had a crazy ex who became his “friend” and was emotionally and financially dependent on him, but that’s another story).
I was the happiest when I was pregnant because 1. He was always at home, 2. No matter what difficulties happened, I always had that little bump in my belly that reminded me that I was going to have this little angel. It went worse and became more obvious that he’s not available much after we had a baby.
When he’s at home and we would have time to chat, he talks about politics. I’m like, exhausted from doing baby stuff all day and try to keep the business afloat, and the most important thing to him is about what happened in a place 10k miles away.
This past 3 months he developed a habit of going to the bar at midnight. Within the same timespan, I have run away from home probably 3-4 times (with our baby) and stayed in hotels because I couldn’t deal with him. I love him, but I hate him so much. I love him, but I don’t feel cherished or taken care of. I feel that his behavior is selfish, self-centered, childish, immature, and stupid. And I feel lonely. I always want a big family but he obviously cannot have another child without losing his mind. He barely survived this one. I get it, he’s an expat, living abroad without his circle of friends, in a country that doesn’t really speaks English. But I think even if we live in his home country, he’ll have this problems anyway.

I have brought up the idea of separating. Even looked for houses. I just want a quiet time and space for myself and my baby without a ball of anxiety walking around us and I have to walk on eggshells already tired from physical work. I don’t think far I just want to be away from him for now. What’s the best way to separate?",0,1750707181.0,expats,5,0.15,False

***Blue. Bright.*** Not a cloud in sight. If you didn’t know what was coming, you could almost believe the world was fine. That today was just Monday. That tomorrow would still happen.

Birds still sang. Cars still moved. *Somewhere,* someone was probably burning toast.

I sat on the back step with my coffee, barefoot, knees pulled tight to my chest. The mug had a hairline crack down the handle. I’d been meaning to glue it for months. *Too late now.*

The news said we had hours. Not days, hours. The solar flare was tearing toward us, too fast, too strong. They stopped pretending to explain it. No more diagrams or clever metaphors. Just anchors with damp eyes reading off autocues like they were confessing something. One of them cried. Just one tear, slipping down her face. 

*I liked her for that.*

The neighbours were silent. The McKennas packed up and left two days ago, drove north like it mattered. Their house sat hollow, front door open, curtains flapping like breath. I hadn’t seen anyone come or go.

My phone buzzed a few more times this morning. I didn’t answer. I didn’t want to. *Not now.* Not with this hanging over everything.

My Labrador, Poppy, lay curled in a patch of sun by the fence, snoring faintly. Totally unaware. Her belly rose and fell, slow and even, like the world wasn’t ending. She stretched and gave this half-hearted groan that made me laugh. First time I’d laughed in days.

I should’ve done more. Should’ve seen my brother at Christmas. Should’ve called my mum back. Should’ve cared less about inboxes, meetings, all the small, pointless things I *used* to treat like emergencies.

But today I had good coffee. I opened every window. I burned the expensive candle I was saving for guests I never invited. I put on a scratched record that skipped and didn’t care. I ate dessert for breakfast. I held Penny close and felt her heartbeat against mine, warm and steady, like a clock that hadn’t been told.

The sun climbed. The air shimmered. Far off, I thought I heard sirens, but they didn’t last long. Just faded into nothing. Nothing but a strange orange glow in the distance.

I stood up, just to look around one more time. The rust on the garden gate. The breeze brushing through the grass like water. The smell of rosemary where it grew wild under the fence. Everything was still alive. That’s what made it worse.

Also, should I(M24) show up unannounced?","So here’s the situation. My ex is turning 23 soon  we were in a serious relationship for 4 years(2 years live in and last 8 months ldr) We broke up about 3 months back, but we still end up talking on and off. Not daily, but there’s still some emotional connection. We work at the same company, just different locations (she’s in Tamil Nadu, I’m in Mumbai). Same profession, same teams cross paths sometimes, so complete no-contact isn’t really possible.

Now, I’ve been thinking of doing something special for her birthday. Thought of gifting her 23 things based on her personality and interests -like stuff she genuinely likes: books that empower women, cute coffee stuff, Netflix merch of her fav shows like Wednesday, gilmore girls,, some cozy sleepwear because she loves sleeping, personalized stationery items etc. Each gift would be small but meaningful. The idea was to reflect who she is, not just random gifts.

Also been thinking whether I should fly down to her town on her birthday, maybe surprise her with the gifts. Not a full-on dramatic entry, but just quietly meet her, wish her, and hand over the gifts.

But then I think-

We’re not officially together.

There’s been a lot of emotional back-and-forth.

She hasn’t blocked me or anything. We’re on okay terms, but not “let’s-get-back” terms either.

I don’t know if she’ll find it sweet, thoughtful… or overwhelming and weird.


I’m not trying to force anything. Just want to make her feel special, like I always promised. But yeah, I know intent isn’t everything - perception matters.

I really need perspective:

Is this thoughtful or too much?

Will showing up unannounced backfire?

Should I just courier the gifts instead?

1lipttb,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoPointMuseum/comments/1lipttb/plywood_island_gold_guide/,Plywood Island - Gold Guide,"Just posting this because I saw a couple of threads on it, and it's the only challenge that I've found annoying. I managed it in 839 days thanks to some tips from others here (to get gold you need to finish it in under 1080 days). 

Here's what I did, and what I'd do better if I wanted to speed run it:

Notes:

\- Remember that the more you do early on, the easier it'll be later, and make plenty of use of pause.

\- Themes-wise, we're just dealing with palaeontology and botany, so if you like consistency plan accordingly. 

\- The final mission requires you to have two of each type of staff at Level 4 or above (one expert of each of the two types). The Afterlife Academy in the Netherworld is your friend and you'll need to make use of it to unlock some locations faster.

\- If I wanted to speed run it I'd go back and check the staff training requirements for every location I ended up visiting and get staff trained in advance.

\- A second helipad costs £100k, but you can only buy one at Level 12. I didn't manage to do this but I suspect there's a way of doing it that'd end up saving even more time.

Guide:

\- Sell off everything except the helipad (normally I like a fresh start with a new building, but cash is critical so sell off the trees etc as well).

\- Take out all the loans.

\- Build an entrance area (ditch the stall and replace with two proper desks); toilets; a staff room; a training room; a smallish gift shop; a smallish café; vending machines; coffee kiosk; map kiosk; and at least one smallish workshop (I found I needed two). Nudge the prices up but don't push the entrance fee up too much (general tip for TPM), and make sure to set your café menu for buzz and cash. Set up your starting exhibits, and make sure that all exhibits are at max buzz as you won't have time to collect many.

\- Recruit two palaeontology and botany experts and all other staff asap. There is time to reject candidates but don't be too picky. Remember that as long as your staff are doing something they're gaining XP.  

\- Start with the mission to get five palaeontology and three botany exhibits - Greasy Fields is an easy win, and I managed to get a complete Sharpontops skeleton from Rib Row quickly and set up a tour only to it to get the four stars to unlock that mission. Don't forget the Sickly Pear in the Allotment Labs in the Burrows for an easy start for your Botanist. 

\- Build all the entertainment exhibits (hence the two workshops - it allows for building things you need for collecting exhibits and speeds things up later). You'll need to send janitors out for the supplies but this just helps level them up. I also started building the mulcher but turned out I didn't need it.

\- Following all that should clear two objectives easy (I managed them in just over 400 days). However, by this point my finances could've been better and I only just made the £5,000 profit to unlock the third mission. 

\- I managed to pay off the smallest loan, take another one out, and take sponsorships to keep me afloat, but it was plain sailing from there. I needed to finish levelling up one Assistant and two Security Guards, but this was all paid for by selling things off - both workshops and the training room can go once you've finished with them. 

It was easily my least favourite map on TPM, but also the shortest. Hope that helps others :)

Back in the day I taking this girl to a pretty secluded event in which you needed either a car or someone to drive you -there were no buses as the place was outside the city limits and under my understanding didn't have a permit-, so an acquaintance of her mom dropped us and left, we hanged around, enjoyed the music, the food, got some drinks, everything was going smooth and chill until the last event when they were going to do a firework show with BG music, people started gathering around to sit on the dirt and we backed away from the crowd to exchange kisses and whatnot, we found a parked trailer and we did our stuff behind it while the fireworks illuminated our surroundings and the music was just close enough to mute our voices, we lost track of the time as the sounds of the crowd, the explosions and the music trailed off into the night.

We came back with a start, the trailer was moving and we were covered in dirt and leaves, we stood up as the vehicles were retreating leaving behind trails of dust, I checked my phone, 2 AM, I asked her If anyone was coming for us, she said no, I being the completely calm girl than I am told her not to worry, we could just hitch a ride with the guys from the event, so we ran to catch them. It was a bust, no one wanted two disheveled girls covered in dirt and smelling of alcohol in their trucks, also back then I looked like a punk, meaning I came across as menacing, so short story short, we appeared like 2 junkies that haven't had their fix and no one gave us a ride, we had to walk 8 km from this god-forsaken place in the middle of nowhere to the nearest highway, it took us almost 2 hours but we did it, the street lights were reassuring and the feeling of civilization filled us with energy, we started calling people to see if anyone could come and rescue us but at almost 5 AM there was no response from either of our attempts.

So we walked towards the city as the sun started to show his face among a sea of gray clouds, its heat on our skin was comforting, I asked her if the date was going well and she just looked at me with puppy eyes holding back tears, I hugged her and gave her a kiss on the cheek and promised to buy her a greasy breakfast and to pounce on her once we reached her house, she smiled at my joke and kept walking, the city lights were getting closer each passing minute and the warmth of the sun kept us in high spirits. And then the first bus of the day appeared, it was completely empty sans some maintenance guys that were joking around at the back, we took a seat and watched as the clouds got darker and darker and the sunlight started fading, I put my arm around her to keep her warm and fell asleep in a second.

I woke up again with a start, the bus had broke down and it was starting to rain, the driver was outside with the guys assisting him with the motor, apparently there was nothing to be done so they started calling for backup, it was 7 AM and we were both hungry and cold, I took my phone and called my dad, voice mail, I woke her up and asked for her phone, taxis were unavailable at our location but the kind lady responding pointed out the nearest pick-up place, a mall with a cinema just shy of 3 km away, I thanked her and asked my lovely companion If she could walk a little more and under the rain, she -no surprise- said no so I didn't press and started thinking of solutions to this pickle.

The answer came to us half an hour later in the form of a gray Sedan that stopped to assist the blinking bus in the middle of the highway, it was a dad and his baby on their way to pick up her mom, we asked him if he could take us to the nearest mall and he gladly accepted, we got in the car and before I could say ""eggs and bacon with a side of ice-cream"" we were on the still closed mall, the guy asked us if we will be OK and I reassured him to not worry, we were going to have something to eat as soon as the place opened and people started flocking in, so he waved us goodbye and we walked towards the doors of the still pitch dark restaurant, we waited there until 9 AM when trucks filled with frozen food started arriving and our stomachs began to growl.

A girl with an umbrella and earphones approached the doors from the parking lot and gave us a side-look, I turned to her and asked if they had maple syrup and she said yes with a confused look, I replied ""Nice, can we get a table?"" and she told me in a very polite tone to wait until the workers finished cleaning, so I woke up my now almost-girlfriend and told her to do some stretching with me to keep warm, the workers watched us in confusion as we started doing pushups on the sidewalk and running in the same spot.

The girl came back, it was almost 10 AM, she invited us inside and handed a pair of menus that we read in like 10 seconds, I hastily blurted out ""6 fried eggs, one fruit serving, 2 orders of hot-cakes with ham on the top, 2 coffees with milk, 3 scoops of vanilla ice-cream and a quarter of sugar free yogurt with nuts please"", the girl wrote down the order, her pencil moving like it had a life on its own, and told us to pick any table, we chose to sit by the side that was starting to receive the warm sun-rays and we waited, the staff turned on the AC and the smells from the kitchen wafted slowly to us indicating we were almost at the end of this journey.

Our order came and we ate with care and delicacy so not to reassert ourselves as the junkies our current state made us appear, I even drew us thanking the staff for their attention on the bill and left leaving a good tip.

13 days in, and my husband is back at work (only took a week off, don't get me started). I did a contact nap this morning, bubs slept for 3 hours and I drifted in and out on the couch with him while he was in the wrap on me. I felt fine and then put him down again at 2pm and tried to nap but the active sleep kicked in and I couldn't fall asleep. Now I'm on coffee number 2 to try and just push through until my husband comes home and takes the night shift and I can go to bed early. (Also, it was our ""worst"" night because bubs woke up an hour after my husband brought him in and then again 2.5hrs later so my sleep was much less!)

I care for him everyday. I work 3 evenings a week 6pm to midnight, home for 1am and I co sleep overnight with him. He wakes averagely 1 to 2 per night. I'm a high sleep needs person but the last month its exhausting. I'm napping when he naps (which I never needed to do before the last month). 

Yes I'll get my bloodwork checked. I'm also definitely not pregnant.

\*Editors note: Ok my friends, man I’m starting to talk like him already, I’ve just been listening to this tape over and over and over, I thought that quote was fitting. Ok so I didn’t actually find the diary I’ll get to that, I found this tape recorder here stuffed under the seat cushion of a cafe just around the alle fornaci, near the Piazza di Santa Maria, just outside Vatican City. Got a nice vibe honestly I’d recommend it if you’re ever there. I lucked out on this work do fr. Any way so I found this tape recorder and on it is this he’s like a professor type dude talking about this diary he snuck out from the Vatican archives like some 3am type shit ya know gotta respect him for that and yeah so he’s talking and he’s reading through this diary which is actually like two diaries of these researchers, shits wild man I’m writing this stuff down, I’ve written out the first chunk like an actual transcript of the recording you know, it’s pretty long but I’m into it dude the worlds gotta know you know? Ok here’s where I’m at so far, enjoy! 

\[ I have stolen a diary from the Vatican archives! My goodness I cannot believe this what I am doing now I’m spitting my coffee everywhere on the table hang on I need a cigarette hang on. Sorry if you can hear rustling my friends ah there, is this? Is this? Ah bless you my friend bless you, owner is letting me smoke here indoors he’s old senile man like me he’s lighting up too I think. Ah ok, hmmm ah to see that beautiful smoke plume about the room nowhere can you do this now, absolutely nowhere its a disaster to mankind, so beautiful too, watching it rise and hang about the dusty ceiling fan and slip away up some crack in the plaster. Ok I’m sorry for this romantic er wax lyrical yes! I hear in a movie ‘wax lyrical’ I’m waxing lyrical! But I am at this moment filled with dread really, truly my friends, I have just had a read through of this and what I have read makes me question all of it I don’t know. I am filled with so many questions, and dread, really, as I say I don’t know, I don’t know what to make of it. I will tell you now what I have found. 

It is a diary, and in it, it’s twin. Yes and it tells of an expedition by two Italian researchers of the ruins buried beneath the Vatican. Why was I here at the Vatican? I was invited for my research many times, but this time I see this diary, ah yes I will be here a while I think if that’s alright, yes thank you bless you again my friend, fortunate I think that I don’t disturb anyone else with my ramblings hah! Yes just this one light will be fine bless you and I watch the traffic go by from the window. He’s wiping down the tables in the far corner, we won’t be interrupted my friends. So this diary is a composite of two diaries spliced together in this way, one from each researcher, with each entry twinned with the other. It is a truly remarkable thing. It is in Italian which I happen to speak but I don’t read it so much so I will translate as I read to you I may not know but I will make educated guess as you would say er in certain parts. My friends do not listen to me lightly now for what I am about to read may change you as it has changed me. \]

Aria diary, Pre expedition: St Peters Basilica, had you been born inside and never let out, you would think it the whole world and be quite contented. It’s majesty is overwhelming, it’s roof is like a second sky, noble pillars like stone trees, walls and doors and stairs with enough statues to fill a bustling city. Yes it is as a world in itself. It took over a hundred years to build and every architect involved in its construction died before he could see his work finished. Yes it was built by the dead, and for the dead. At its crown is the ceremonial tomb of St Peter, said to be placed above the actual grave of that ancient man. In the coming days we may yet find out. That’s a good introduction, keep this for future report Aria. I’m nervous but mostly excited, this discovery could be huge for well everyone I suppose, whatever we find, if anything. Though this tunnel they’ve found is not a geological anomaly I think, it is localised directly beneath an important place of worship, ancient and Roman, paved over in a thin veil of mosaic slate. The floor, beautiful though it was, cracked like an egg shell when the stone cornucopia fell on it. Seems to me that we were meant to find it at some point, even if it took two thousand years for someone to knock that thing off its pedestal. We met with Vatican authorities and university representatives and always we were circled by papal advisers, black robed and red sashed; The Council of Cardinals. They watched us intently, always listening and conferring with each other. We are here at their request though they never addressed me directly. I feel as though you know when they say don’t name the farm animals.

They had cancelled any afternoon tours so the hall was empty. It’s hard to talk here the echo is so cacophonous. As they led us deeper into the Basilica we passed through more modest rooms and hallways where we discussed the finer details. Recovery teams are on standby but they’ll be relatively lax on the first day, given the surprising estimates for duration. It is said the tunnel is extensive, and goes deep beneath the earth, and then there’s the door. We were led into a small grotto, a little private church like a 1/2 scale miniature for a movie set, complete with little pews like the chairs we had in primary school. This is a place of private prayer it is explained, a stunning contrast from the overwhelming extravagance of the grand hall of the nave and the central dome. I took the opportunity to address one of the Cardinals, something like, ‘the layers of this building is just extraordinary’. He smiled but never looked at me, he just laughed and said, ‘In my Fathers house there are many rooms’. At the far end was a door even I had to duck to get under. It led into a hallway that still we were bowing our heads brushing against the ceiling, the walls were merely arms length and we were single file now. Down narrow steps we went in a spiral. No longer renaissance, far older but the steps were pristine. They lit LED torches, a white ghostly light flooded the stairwell. “These are the stairs of St Clement” they said, “the staircase to the necropolis, city of the dead.” We stepped gradually downward, catching ourselves nervously on the narrow walls. “The first stair was placed at the last burial, and built backwards, never descended. The workers sealed the stair and never returned, lest they disturb the sleep of the dead.” 

As we moved through older walls of the Vatican so too we moved through older beliefs of Christianity; the later gospels of Mark and Luke emphasise spiritual resurrection, it is the spirit that ascends to heaven. However St Peter bore witness to the bodily resurrection of Christ, as well as spiritual, his broken body entombed, emerged whole and so preached that we too will be resurrected in our bodies at the final judgement. So the bodies entombed down here have been preserved, much like the Pharaohs found in the Valley of the Kings, and as we stepped off the staircase and into the necropolis, that much was clear. Bandaged bodies stacked like books lined the walls that disappeared up into shadow. There were buildings, all houses, with viewless windows, doorless frames, stairs to nowhere, cooking utensils and empty beds. There was a small town centre of sorts with a central well, long since dried if ever there was water. We followed cables now that snaked along the floor through the small city, between buildings down alleys dotted with safety ramps and flood lights, they were leading us to the courtyard. A sort of public area like a playground, dust covered floor, terracotta stained walls, and the central plinth, with the stone cornucopia split in two upon the cracked slate floor. 

This was it, my first look at it. The pictures showed a black shadow beneath the floor, something you could fall into if you weren’t careful I thought, the black gate of hell we all imagined in this place. But here it is just a crawlspace, it goes 2 feet below the floor if that, and just wide enough for one person to get on their belly and crawl through, completely prone. But it has been made by tools, and the scans show it leads under the necropolis steadily sloping downwards before reaching a ‘door’ of some kind. They know its a door because further tunnels lead beyond it. As I write this it is hitting me that my work is no longer just theory, that I’ll be the one crawling down there, for three days. 

Matteo diary, Pre expedition: Christ she could have worn something more professional than leggings, I mean we’re in the Vatican for fuck sake, the Basilica of St. Peter. She doesn’t understand that it reflects poorly on me. You bring your gear in a bag and you get changed after the formal greetings. This is basic stuff. It’s all going in the report when we get back. She’s already a distraction, it’s bad for the mission. She’s not exactly a head turner but it’s just weird seeing her again let alone at her request. I’m surprised she’s even in demand. I wasn’t wrong about her but I suppose some people just slip through the cracks regardless of actual ability. Anyway the briefing was good, pretty much matched my own analysis of the situation, nothing new to learn from these guys. My expertise is really going to shine here. The ultrasound scans look promising, my most optimistic guess is that we will find the true tomb of St Peter, we may even recover his bones. Indeed there are tombs down there, earth untouched since the days of the apostles, and I will be the first.

\[ You see they prepare now to venture beneath the earth. The Vatican is truly splendid I have seen much of it but never have I been led down such steps as this to the necropolis. Through the tourist entrance only have I done so. The Excavators found many curious things there as leather slippers by the beds presumably for the dead upon waking. Much has our traditions changed don’t you think friends? The expedition is about to begin, I feel now a pity as I read for Aria. \]

Aria diary, Day 1: The crawlspace floor was sunk in an inch of fine ash, like crawling through the oven of a crematorium left to cool after the burning. Death is on all of our minds down here. It was all I could do not to breath it in, straining my neck to keep my chin above the ashes. About 40 minutes into the crawl our body heat began to cook the tunnel; slicks of sweat slunk down my nose tickled my lip and dripped into the ash, then evaporated up and condensed on the ceiling dripping down into my hair and on the back of my neck. God it’s like breathing through a jockstrap. And now the ash has turned to a mud, a slimy porridge it’s caked the equipment. I found a breast stroke movement to wade through the ashen mud kept it from building up under my chin as I heaved my body forward. But I am writing now because we have reached the door. After a two hour crawl we’ve made it, the cave swells around the door and so we can stand with knees bent, give our arms and legs a stretch and rest. So the door, what to say about it, it’s just a door as you would know it, a wooden door, about 4ft tall. The wood should have long since rotted away, but I suppose like the thousands of wooden stilts beneath Venice, the wood has been petrified in some way so as to be preserved. It has an iron ring handle that lifts a simple latch on the other side and it will open. There are engravings however, scratched coarsely against the grain, improvised or done in hast. We can’t read it, it is not latin as I would have expected from a Roman ruin. It could be said to be kin of Aramaic though upside down. 

Matteo diary, Day 1: I encouraged Aria to ring out her shirt like I have, better for the days ahead, no point being a prude down here we’ve got a job to do and it’ll go a lot smoother if we’re not sodden in sweat and mud. The crawlspace was very challenging but we passed through without issue, I probably could have gone faster if I wasn’t holding up the rear. I’ll take the lead now that we’ve reached the door. I’ve studied the scans and from the two I’ve decided it’s best to take the tunnel on the right that slops down from beyond this door. I must say the door is not what I expected, it’s very simple, it is not decorated at all like the seal of a tomb. 

Aria diary, Day 1, Secondo: We’ve radioed in that we’ve reached the first checkpoint. From here communications are expected to drop given the depth and density of the rock above us now. So now the crew is relying most on our estimated time of return; a three day expedition. We will continue our radio prompts as normal but we’re not to panic if we get no response, easier said than done. It was all in the briefing and I agreed, but now that we’re down here it’s hard not to feel so far removed from it. We are at the door beneath the earth now, and with the layers of rock and dirt, chamber atop chamber holding up the heft of the grand Basilica, there might as well be a mountain above our heads. 

\[ Something here leaps out at me from the pages friends about this door that they have found. It reminds me of a fascinating article I referenced from the journal of the society of theological archeology of Ankara, by a professor Murat: ‘Semiotics as language in the ancient world’ it was called yes, where Murat himself claims to have found at the back of a cave in the horn of Africa, desperate markings scratched by nail and bone. Described as ‘protoaramiac’ in nature he argued that the er how you say primitive perhaps not right word but simple lines were evocative of a semitic seal either as a prayer or warning it is unclear for certain. He noted that the cave itself was known locally as in English something like ‘bountiful mouth’ where by their custom they would leave the bodies of the dead to be dismembered and eaten up by the beasts as to return to nature. Anyway I will continue reading now I apologise for this interruption I interrupt I cannot help it now. \] 

Aria diary, Day 2: I’ve just awoken from a dream, it was pulling me down, I had to wrench myself from sinking forever. Blinking in the dark. I have to get it down. I’m writing by the light of my headlamp now, it’s the only light we have left. I was swimming, treading water in a deep lake far from shore. It was wondrous, I felt wondrous. I was compelled by an uncanny curiosity for all things, as all things were new to me. How the scarlet sash of the rising sun sparked the sky alight, tearing asunder the thundering clouds. How the green water writhed around me. A prickly static in the air I lifted my nose to it. It was all so wondrous. I saw the birds in the sky, I heard the beasts on the land, and so I wandered what was beneath the water. I bowed my head and dipped below the surface. Opening my eyes to the blurry green world I saw great spears of sunshine pierce the water from above, but falter and fade into the shadows of the deep. I saw something move far away, far below my kicking feet. So far it was as a shadow passing through shadow. It pushed through the water like some giant slug. It curled slowly twisting its soft limbless mass. Fear overwhelmed my wonder and I snapped my head out of the water. I splashed and kicked but could make no movement, I cried out to no-one, the clouds eclipsed the sun. In darkness, the water turned a black ink. I breathed in. I breathed out. The last crescent of light above vanished behind the storm. The waves of the water lilted softly before settling still. I too became still. I dipped my head below once more and saw before me a giant grey face it was smiling rising from the depths and I awoke to a darkness as dark as any deep. Matteo had taken my headlamp off me in my sleep.

We have fallen. We took the path that sloped right after passing through the door. Walking on bent knees he took the lead, and I trusted his experience as I had prepared myself to do so before the mission. He had won the confidence of the team above and I might’ve shared their enthusiasm had I never met him. But we were following the map. Ahead of me he walked when he suddenly fell into the ground kicking up ash. He had slipped through a fissure and was grappling on the rock, I reached down for him but he lost his footing and dragged me down too. We’re not seriously hurt only a bit scratched up by some miracle. But our equipment is dire, down to one radio that’s hissing at me, and one headlamp between us. I made the decision that we would rest here, take stock and reassess our situation. Matteo kicked his pack but eventually backed down. I could tell he was tired. The walls here are masoned, great bricks of carven stone, sharp and black as slate. A hallway seems to stretch onwards but it’s too dark. It might be for the best if we just stay put, ride out the next two days and wait for rescue. Though I can’t stay still. Now that I’ve had some sleep I almost wish I hadn’t. That dream. That face I can’t shake it, I’m crying I think, yes. Oh Aria. I miss the sky, I miss my cat Diner, and now he’s gawking at me.

Matteo diary, Day 2: Someones certainly getting emotional down here. Yes what do you know she’s curled up away from me in the foetal position scratching away at her diary, lord knows what she’s on about in that thing. We’re not lost necessarily, the tunnels have just proven different to the schematics we’d been given, it’s not my fault though. Heads are gonna roll for this when we get out, they know I’m a big deal, and once they realise we’re late to return they’ll be organising a ‘rescue’ party to come get us, I have no doubt, unless they’re even more incompetent than they’ve proven to be. I can lead us out no problem, it’s classic caving, I had the basics figured out before most, but she won’t submit, she’s got that woman brain see’s me as the patriarchy or something, just that performative neofeminism bullshit you know, fact is I’m the more experienced caver on this expedition so it’s only right that I lead, gender doesn’t come into it. If we’re lost it’s because of her honestly, and I’ll write as much in my report when I get out of here. But despite her failings I did feel for her earlier, she started crying, burst out into tears, I knew it was coming. It is dark and dangerous down here and we’re all alone I get it, it’s scary. I watched a tear slide down her cheek and slip into her cleavage. I have, and of course I would never, this is just for reference, but it has crossed my mind that we’re all alone down here. She’s probably feeling it too. I mean plain Jane’s not the best girl I’ve had but down here we might as well be Adam and Eve. 

\[ Friends we may have some company soon I don’t know, a black car has been parked in the road for 15 even maybe more minutes I don’t know, just stopped in the road as traffic goes around it, beeping their horns at it. I didn’t notice it for the constant stream of headlights flashing through the rain, that nice orange light you get on old cars sometimes it is nice though a cafe window. But now I think this car is not so nice. But worry not friends I am old, what they come up and say ten years in Gulag? I say to them I think I won’t even make the plane journey there! I will read on, yes read on I shall this is important now I think very much. I am warm and comfortable and I blow smoke at them hah! \] 

\*Editors note: You know I’m really feeling this guy, he’s got that passion I vibe with it, was thinking of writing a song about it or something like classic just me and my guitar like ‘Hey there Aria’ I don’t know that just came to me, is that something you guys would be interested in? Yeah I could even record it on this same tape recorder so it’ll like tell the story in that way you know have those layers going on, I like the sound it makes when I have to rewind it too I could use that, yeah I’ll play around with it. Any way I’ve finished typing up the rest of the transcript, haven’t typed this much since college dude frfr. 

Matteo diary, Day 3: I’ve taken the lead and she’s following behind me like a lost puppy. There’s no way I was about to sit and wait for two days in the solid dark whilst a rescue team fumbles about. It doesn’t make sense for that crawlspace to be the only entrance or exit from this place. These hallways, about as wide as my wingspan, are stone brick, so the masons would have had to dig a mineshaft to shuttle shale and dirt to the surface, I just have to find it. The way the brickwork of the walls transition seamlessly to bare rock in places seems to me that the architect of this ancient place adapted the passages from natural tunnels already in the earth. At least I can walk tall in this place, there’s no sight of a ceiling. I’m keeping to the right anytime a hallway ends. We’ve made two right turns now. The last three hallways each terminated into identical antechambers with hallways verging left or right. Always at the far end is a small alter table with a loaf of bread, warm as though freshly baked, and a cup of wine. I’m not about to eat nor drink anything from a tomb, smells corked to me anyway. The bread’ll be rotten, it’s a trick of the dark. It gets to you. It would get to anyone even the most experienced caver as I am. No one could get a decent sleep in a place like this. I had a dream last night, and the song is stuck in my head. After a day of skittering about endless hallways it was sensible to make camp, though I didn’t find much rest. I rolled out my bed against the cold wall of the hallway and lay down to face Aria. It would be warmer if we huddled, It’s a matter of survival now, but she’s frigid. She had to sleep near me at least anyway because I’ve kept the headlamp on me, don’t trust her not to break it somehow. But this dream, I need to get it down it’ll clear my head. 

I was in the dark, a dark cave, and before me fell a moon beam like a spotlight on a stage. Sitting on a rock with the pale light on his back was the god Pan. The matted black fur on his legs absorbed the light. He was sitting with hooves crossed and with his flute in hand, breathing into it like air escaping the lungs of a corpse when the chest is compressed. The song he played was wondrous though. It was sad but mighty. I can honestly say I’ve never heard it before, my subconscious must have made it up, of course I had it in me. It lilts and marches, sighs and commands. The song a vulture would sing when waiting for its sorry prey to finally die. He seemed engrossed in his playing, and I risked moving closer, slowly. The grey mottled skin of his back looked sickly and smelled sour. I moved to circle him, to get a look at his face. I was parallel to him now when he stopped playing. He turned his face to me, smiling a toothless gummy grin. A slug of drool hung off his lip to his flute. Then he stood up, laughed a bellowing laugh and burrowed himself under the earth as a worm eats through dirt. I woke up flinging my arms up as if it was me who had been buried. She was looking at me, I didn’t like it. 

Aria diary, Day 3: Matteo went darting down the hall with my headlamp. Since I’m the appointed lead on this expedition the safety of us both is my responsibility, I had no choice but to follow him. He’s convinced they’ll be another way out close by, and perhaps he’s right. But the further we go into this maze the further the rescue teams have to go to find us. I’m going only by the light bobbing off his forehead, behind me is darkness always, like it’s chasing us. These hallways are featureless and each ends in the same antechamber. There’s a three foot drop to the floor when we exit a hallway. Every turn we make we venture deeper into the earth. But there’s something else, at the far wall of each antechamber is a simple table, white clothed, baring bread and wine. It is the Eucharist right? I can’t help but feel like we are being given chances to, I don’t know, chances. This place is getting to me. 

\[ This. It shakes my belief, maybe carbon dioxide build up in the tunnels I don’t know. And right here loose as a bookmark is a written note from a Cardinal Alessio I will read it to you, “The tunnels seem as though a labyrinth beneath the Basilica. My own appointed specialists have scaled the fissure and are now attempting to find *those*stairs that are most intriguing. Concerning the eucharist, it is my recommendation that if we can find it we will treat this as a miracle in our efforts to beautify his holiness the pope upon his death whenever that may be. The accounts of these two subjects will be used in private for such a purpose as this.” They move now to follow them down there wherever they may be I don’t know. But I will read now from Aria my friends for things they have not gone so well. \]

Aria diary, Day 3, Secondo: I can still hear him screaming in the walls. I ran there’s nothing I can do, there’s nothing I can do. Matteo he found along the wall of a hallway an opening at the base like a vent, “it’s another crawlspace” he said he was convinced it must be the way out so he fell down onto his belly and crawled inside it I grabbed his legs but he kicked me. I was screaming for him all I could do was watch the light of his headlamp grow smaller and smaller in the dark. I could hear him scrapping his elbows against the walls and dragging his chest on the rock. But then he stopped, about thirty feet away from me I think. He said he could see feet. The soles of feet as of someone lying on their chest. Fleshy pink soles and thick yellow toenails, like they were preserved. Then he screamed he was screaming “they’re moving oh my god oh my god” they were moving oh my god he said there were more he could see more ahead another and another he said it goes on and on through the earth he was screaming “get me out"" but there was nothing I could do there’s nothing I can do. I ran in the dark I ran I grabbed his pack off the floor and ran I hit my head I think I kept running and now I’m here. I’m here at the foot of it. It’s a staircase, it goes up I haven’t climbed it yet. I’m writing by the thread of light coming from above. But I can still hear him. He’s stuck. He’s crying for his mother. He’s crying. This must be a way out, this must be. 

\[ …I… I don’t know. I will just read on I think. Yes that is for the best I think… \]

Aria diary Day 4: I’ve come back down. I’m sat on the step at the foot of the stairs, writing by this last light, reflecting on what I’ve seen. It’s all quiet now. No tears. The stairs opened out into a small grotto of white washed stone, man made it seemed to me, entirely like an ancient church of the holy land, with a high window beaming warm midday sunshine onto the far wall. And there on the far wall the light bloomed upon a faded fresco, of green grass and golden earth, with trees Olive and Sweet thorn and strong Palestinian Oak. Petals fell upon a blue stream that wound through reeds to a glade in it’s centre. And there stood another tree, solitary, sentinel, and entirely dead. It made me shudder. Then I noticed a small wooden door on the wall to my left, like a shed door honestly. A cool draft tickled my toes and I could hear on the other side a wind in the treetops and the songs of birds and streams and whistling reeds, like the fresco, only I dared not open the door. I felt, ashamed. I felt as though I would be trespassing, I can’t explain it. I felt suddenly that I should not be caught lingering here, lest unseen forces might hurt me. I can’t explain it. I did not feel alone. I’m back in the tunnel now, close to where we parted though I cannot hear him screaming anymore. I keep thinking about that room. I keep thinking about it. I will miss the light but I have to go back. I must endure this darkness still. 

\[ There is only one more entry after this. I hope most sincerely friends that the Cardinals team has found her down there though for who knows how long she wanders. But the room she finds I must talk about it. For what could this be if not the garden? *The* Garden, as the story goes with the apple and the ya know. Was this real or was she granted a vision I don’t know but it is her hesitation that interests me really. She hears beyond the door the sounds of a paradise, again *the* paradise but she turns away, why if not only for the innate in all of us feeling that we are unworthy no? 

This story and I am not a religious er I’m certainly not a ‘man of the cloth’ as you might say but this is consistent with that catastrophic betrayal that lead to our you and me and all to death and ruin. Beauty, that is what she is describing. And why does she feel unworthy of this ‘trespassing’ as she says it is because of beauty! There is nothing my friends, nothing more well you know I do like the women you know especially from certain angles you know I kid here of course but I am serious now when I say this; That there is nothing more beautiful than Creation. From stars flinging dust spinning moons around planets and electrons orbiting neutrons protons etc you know and the crickets playing their sweet sweet violins in the tall grass and the great bear scratching its back on the bark and you know so much more of this, the tardigrade for example fantastic creature. And who does he the big man appoint to care for all this? 

Yes! Yours truly you and I and all of us my friends! Even this God himself does not touch it after Creation read the book the bible it will tell all he does not create after creating in the beginning, he leaves it to us, why? Why do we till the dirt and tame the wolf? Why do we like the little critters that go boing boing through the woods and up to our porch with its whiskers and we give it bread and watch it scurry away? Why do we like this so much? Because my friends we are the caretakers. Or were supposed to be. To tend the garden from which all of paradise may spread forth and encompass the whole world. But instead we did this betrayal and now we must fight like rats in buckets for scraps of happiness. And until we our worthy again we may not enter the garden, so it seems to me. And this is what this woman here feels most strongly so strongly she turns away, dutifully as if in atonement. I wish we could see this garden my friends I wish she did not turn away. May it be enough that we can hear the sweet birds and the soft breeze from the other side of the door. \] 

Aria diary, Day (unspecified): I eat the bread and drink the wine. Every turn I eat and drink. I crawl through halls and sleep on ash. I cannot see. I feel the walls on my finger tips. I hear panicked voices chant in the dark. My rescuers?

\[ They are coming now, they don’t know I have recorded it I think not, they just think I am an old man rambling by the window. I will have to give it up to them but I will hide you here under the cushion, farewell my friends! Good evening gentlemen, Ciao! Allegro allegro! No no, no no it is a gift, a souvenir from the gift shop. Don’t rush me I’m an old man as you see, do not rush me okay? Okay? Hey okay I’m getting up, hey!..wait a minute that’s too hard, ah! You know fascism originated here in Italy you know!… \] 

\*Editors note: That’s it, there’s about twenty minutes of crackle after that, some sounds of traffic then *click,* it shuts off. I guess they got the old man huh, and the diary too. He never did give his name, not out of prudence though probably just excitement and nerves, can’t look him up or nothing. But yeah, that’s it. Man if it’s true though, wild you know? I’m definitely gonna work on that song. Last thing though, stuck on the back of the tape recorder is this business card for a bakery somewhere in Italy, but on the back in pencil is scribbled ‘From the Gospel of Thomas: The Disciples said to him. “When will the Kingdom come?” And Jesus replied, “The Kingdom of the Father is spread out upon the earth, and people do not see it.” (Saying 113)’  

Disclaimer: 

Thank you for reading I hope you enjoyed it. First I’d like to say that whilst I hope my respect for the beliefs of Christianity and the Abrahamic religions concerned is clear, I of course have used certain things to certain effect. Chiefly the attitudes towards burial proposed in the story. Christian attitudes have changed over time of course but I make no judgment on my part, I just needed an excuse to line the walls with bodies. In fact a historically cherished tradition associated with such religions are Ossuaries, where the bones of the departed are placed in small boxes often found interred in family tombs in and around Jerusalem and Jericho, and as far as Rome as a tradition of the Roman Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodoxy. Cremation too is now just as proper a means of burial as any other, having increased in popularity after the first world war and is now widely accepted by most Christian denominations whom state, ‘…In the end, however, we should remember that the resurrection will take place by the power of God, who created the heavens and the earth. Ultimately, whether a person's body was buried at sea, destroyed in combat or an accident, intentionally cremated or buried in a grave, the person will be resurrected. -Church of LDS (wikipedia) 

Secondly I appreciated the misogyny is hard to read. It’s certainly on all our minds right now with everything going on in the world but I hope it’s worth it for the story.

And lastly take care of yourself. There’s a lot of bad going on out there and we can’t help but feel powerless to it all. But if you can find the time and energy to do something you love, even if it’s writing silly stories on reddit, then do it and life will get better I promise. Happiness is a fleeting thing, all we can do is try. Failure doesn’t come in to it. ",2,1750705998.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

This weekend my girlfriend broke up with me stating that she she needs space, doesn’t feel as comfortable with me and my insecurities have brought her to think I distrust her (I brought the topic of sharing location to her). 

She broke up via text and I called her right away and we talked a bit and she said she has an avoidant attachment style and I believe that since our relationship was getting more serious and emotionally heavy, mixed with the fact that she has a lot of personal stress right now as well, it pushed her to break up with me.

However, I really wanna be given a chance to change together and grow together. I called her today after I noticed that she blocked me on insta and snap and we agreed to talk in a couple days. She said she will unblock me and hasn’t blocked my number. 

I’m asking for advice on how to get back together? I wanna bring up maybe not jumping back into a relationship but staying in contact and checking up on each other everyonce in a while and going out on simple walks or coffee together.

Building a company isn't all ""hustle porn"" and TechCrunch headlines. After burning my fingers (okay, my whole hand) building in this crazy startup world, here's what nobody tells you:  
  
1. Your head will mess with you

∙ Some days you feel unstoppable. Others? Like a total fraud  
∙ Everyone looks like they know what they're doing. Spoiler: They don't  
∙ You'll switch between ""we're gonna be huge"" and ""we're totally screwed"" 5 times before lunch  
∙ Pro tip: Get a therapist before you think you need one

2. Time is brutal

∙ Those ""quick meetings"" and ""casual coffees""? They're killing your company  
∙ Stop saying yes to stuff just to be nice  
∙ Your calendar is like your diet - garbage in, garbage out  
∙ Every hour spent with time-wasters is an hour your competition spends building

3. Real talk about people

• News flash: Everyone's replaceable (yep, even you)  
• Cheap hires are like cheap shoes - you'll pay for it later  
• ""Culture fit"" isn't just startup buzzword bingo  
• You know that person you're hesitating to fire? Do it yesterday

4. The customer truth

∙Your cheapest customers will give you the biggest headaches  
∙ They'll argue about $10 and demand million-dollar service  
∙ Bad customers are like bad relationships - expensive and exhausting  
∙ When someone shows you they're a pain, believe them the first time

5. Market stuff nobody admits

∙That ""huge market"" you're targeting? Everyone else is too  
∙Just because it's a billion-dollar market doesn't mean you'll see any of those billions  
∙ Being too early feels exactly the same as being wrong  
∙ Find the people who actually want to pay you (novel concept, right?)

6. Money talk

∙ If nobody's complaining about your prices, they're too low  
∙ Revenue is like oxygen - you'll notice it most when you don't have it  
∙ Profitable beats popular every time  
∙ Your pricing strategy shouldn't be ""whatever makes everyone happy""

7. The team and advisors reality

∙ Want equity? Cool. Show me your check first  
∙ Trust takes forever to build and seconds to break  
∙ Clear beats clever every time  
∙ Alignment isn't about everyone being friends - it's about everyone being honest

8. VC truth

∙ Most VCs are just well-dressed ghosters  
∙ ""Let's keep in touch"" = ""No""  
∙ They have their own game to play  
∙ Your emergency isn't their emergency

Bottom Line? Stop trying to make everyone happy. Focus on building something real. Something that lasts.

9. Quick hits that cost me:

∙ Your gut feeling is usually right (but verify with data)  
∙ Sleep isn't optional  
∙ Numbers don't lie, but they do hide  
∙ The best pitch deck can't save a broken business",3,1750705581.0,Entrepreneurs,0,1.0,False

1liovn1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ausadhd/comments/1liovn1/2_years_into_diagnosis_and_medication_31m_nsw/,2 years into diagnosis and medication / 31M NSW,"Hi all, even though two years is so early in my journey and I’m still learning/fine-tuning various things, I wanted to put this in here just in case it answers future questions, encourages others to search for answers or can provide an insight into someone’s life with an adult diagnosis as I’m extremely grateful for the times when I had questions and this thread / other FB groups helped me out.

—
The pivotal moment for me (among further reading) in realising I needed to pursue a diagnosis was reading on a NSW government website something along the lines of “some people with undiagnosed AD/HD get by in life just fine but might feel like they’re not quite reaching their full potential”. 
That hit the nail on the head for me.

Some of this may make you feel extremely seen and other bits may be completely foreign to you:

Since my diagnosis and trial to find the correct dosage (30mg Ritalin LA with the option for 5mg short release top up on long work days) my quality of life has improved in almost every conceivable single aspect. 

- My mind is calm, less digressive, less paranoid and my train of thought is more pragmatic and streamlined. 
- Day to day anxiety has dropped from 6/10 to 1/10.
- The problems or deviations from the plan that would have previously seemed like mountains now seem like molehills.
- My To-Do list is finally decreasing instead of increasing.
- I don’t zone out 6 times during a conversation with my parents & my new relationship is going stronger than any of my previous ones ever have.
- I’m present, thoughtful and have the mental capacity to not just tend to my own oxygen mask but now to my girlfriend, friends and family. 
- On a night out after a few hours of drinking, my impulsive desire to think about how good of an idea it would be to find drugs has drastically declined and often seems unappealing.
- I realised coffee was like taking a shotgun to a distant target and the Ritalin was like using a sniper to effortlessly hit the bullseye every time.
- Procrastination is almost completely a thing of the past and recently saved me from missing some very big opportunities regarding my career (sole trader/freelance musician) and I’m reaping the benefits of not putting these things off tenfold now. 

But having lived 29 years uneducated or unmedicated, and to now have to learn how to adjust to its introduction into my (almost) day to day life, it was an unlearning process in many aspects. So, it’s not without its drawbacks which I’ll list here:
- Learning when to eat, when to take the medication, why it’s a terrible idea to take the medication without food - have all been a learning curve. 
- How to plan my days off from medication (even if I need to work) and having the resilience to get it done or forgiving myself for not.
- What time of day to take it so I can function but also still get to sleep.
- How to plan the rhythm of my week knowing how the Ritalin reacts to my body and sleep patterns over a period of time that’s more than just 24h prior.
- Realising that just because I’m medicated doesn’t mean that I have all the answers for someone else who might be looking for answers.
- How to effectively structure my day to get what I need done whilst also being present with others.
- Having enough self-awareness to not non-consensually infodump on unsuspecting friends with my fixations to the point where they no longer reply to my messages (I’ve been on the receiving end of this far to much to ever think that it’s fun for the other person).

Some caveats:
- The screening and testing cost me approximately $2,500 between all specialist appointments as well as needing my parents and sister to sign off on my childhood behaviours since 13 years ago I never thought I’d need my primary school reports for anything ever.
- You will still need to work on yourself. The medication is not a zero-effort, fix-all solution to functioning in society with AD/HD, it just helps you have a better grip on and understanding of your behaviours so you can start to manage them.
- I’ve read of some horror stories of patient experiences with their prescribing psychiatrist but even though my consults were more clinical and colder than I expected, they’re not a  therapist. 
- Everything my psych has outlined and advised of me has ended up being the best and safest thing to do and when I tried tweaking their advice or guidelines it was always either less effective or had a negative effect.

In true AD/HD fashion, I couldn’t just make this a short post and there are likely even more things I could include that I’ll remember as soon as I hit ‘Post’ but I feel this is good for now. 
I’m also pretty sure readers here will either read all of it or none of it.",3,1750704501.0,ausadhd,1,1.0,False
1liovis,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pickleball/comments/1liovis/i_have_a_pickleball_problem_and_its_not_which/,I Have a Pickleball Problem… And It’s Not Which Paddle to Use,"Let’s just get this out of the way: I love pickleball.

I’m not confused about my paddle (although I did spend three sleepless nights on Reddit comparing carbon fiber vs graphite). My shoes are broken in, my bag is dialed, and I can even parallel park under pressure. So what’s the problem?

It’s finding people to play with.

I know. It sounds like a small thing. But when you’ve got two young kids, a demanding full-time job, and a side hustle that thinks it’s your main hustle, time becomes your most precious resource—right up there with black coffee and Wi-Fi.

So when I do carve out two golden hours to play, I want it to be worth it. I want rallies, not babysitting drills. I want opponents who know the difference between a dink and a drive—and more importantly, know how to return both.

But here’s what usually happens:
	•	I confirm a game.
	•	Someone cancels 30 minutes before because they “forgot about their dog’s haircut.”
	•	I end up playing with that one guy who only drives from the baseline like it’s Wimbledon 2007.
	•	Or worse… I get a group text saying “Let’s just hit around casually!” Casual? My friend, I wore my good socks for this.

I’m not asking for pro-level competition—I’m asking for the sweet spot: players around my skill level, who show up when they say they will, and who understand that this isn’t just exercise—it’s me time. My therapy, my cardio, my social life, and my competitive fix all in one.

And when that time gets wasted? Ooof. That’s not just a bad game. That’s lost time I could’ve spent grocery shopping, doing laundry, or staring blankly at the wall in peace.

So yeah, I have a pickleball problem.
And it’s not about gear.
It’s about people.

Anyone else feel me?

1liotnv,https://www.reddit.com/r/migraine/comments/1liotnv/qulipta_20_days_in/,QULIPTA 20 days in …,"I have been on Q (atogepant for those not in US) for 3 weeks. The first week at 15 mg (60 mg divided into 4), and since then at 30 mg. 

My experience thus far:
—Headaches: I have stopped waking up with a headache and sore shoulder every morning that necessitated excedrin in the past if i didn’t want it to become a migraine. So definitely less head ache days and has cut my excedrin use quite a bit
I do notice that I feel my TMJ pain in my temple and jaw behind ear a LOT more (TMJ Botox has definitely worn off) and this was something to adjust to understand if I was just feeling that and should take excedrin or if i was feeling aura and needed nurtec.

—Migraines: Started right before period and still had menstrual migraines (on 15 mg) but they were less severe and I had more time to take nurtec before they took off into pain higher than a 2. Also significantly shorter than typical (even with nurtec)

—Slight constipation but so far manageable with ensuring oatmeal, magnesium, and chia seeds supplemented with coffee a couple of times a week
RELATED: thirst/hydration — for 6 hours after Q i have dry mouth to rival when taking Benadryl/pseudophedrine (the good stuff). Drinking 1 hydration drink per day (Sprout color fuel) and copious water throughout the day helps with this including ensuring about 16 ounces before bed after taking Q (anytime between 6pm and 9pm). 
No real stomach pain that I can tell, but I never had that issue with Nurtec either

—Mood/focus: no change here that I can tell. If anything better mood because i don’t wake dragging and needing an hour to get head/neck pain under control. No anxiety that I can tell (as I’ve been able to have coffee that in past few years has made me too anxious)

—Sleep: Here is where its hard to tell first week with period my sleep was poor but i wasn’t extra tired. I was tired/fatigued about 2 hours after Q but wouldn’t fall asleep for more than 45 minutes and only if really sitting still. Woke up better in mornings even if I had tossed/turned. After the first week, i was actually sleeping better with it

—Other: the first week I did have an hour or so of tooth pain that i was worried about needing root canal or something but excedrin wouldn’t reduce it. It was within 2 hours of taking Q and lasted another 2. However, after that first week it went away and haven’t had since. 

—Nausea: I have not really experienced this. I do overall have a bit less of an appetite and feel like I’m getting full sooner, which may be related to guts adjusting to the constipation slow down but no nausea

Caveats: Prior to 9 mos ago I had severe iron-deficient anemia (thanks uterus) so my tolerance for fatigue and brain fog may be severely skewed. I also am overly aware of GI issues due to lifetime of GI allergies and past carcinoid syndrome issue. I have not had constipation effects from Nurtec in past, though i do typically experience nausea if i don’t eat something within 1 hour of taking nurtec

#  What is MITOLYN?

  
MITOLYN is a premium dietary supplement scientifically formulated to support mitochondrial health, cellular energy production, cognitive performance, and overall vitality.  
  
  
Think of mitochondria as the batteries that power every cell in your body. As we age—or simply live high-stress, low-sleep lifestyles—those batteries weaken. This causes fatigue, brain fog, mood swings, and reduced physical stamina.  
  
  
MITOLYN’s formula is designed to recharge those batteries from the inside out. It targets the root of low energy and cognitive decline, not just the symptoms. That’s what makes it stand out in a crowded market of generic energy pills.  
  
  
 Why I Gave MITOLYN a Try

  
As a busy professional and parent, my days are packed from dawn to dusk. Despite sleeping well and eating clean, I constantly felt like I was running on empty by mid-afternoon.  
  
  
Coffee didn’t help. Neither did meditation, hydration, or other natural energy hacks. After scouring forums and Reddit threads for something legit, MITOLYN kept popping up with real customer praise—not just paid endorsements.  
  
  
What drew me in? The science-backed formula. Ingredients like CoQ10, PQQ, Acetyl-L-Carnitine, and Alpha Lipoic Acid weren’t just fluff—they had actual research behind them.  
  
  
 My Experience Using MITOLYN  
I started taking 2 capsules every morning with a glass of water, as recommended. I didn’t expect miracles overnight—but to my surprise, changes came quicker than I thought.  
  
  
 Week 1:  
No more post-lunch crash.  
  
  
Subtle but noticeable energy improvement.  
  
  
I started waking up feeling more rested.  
  
  
 Week 2:  
Focus and clarity improved. I was more productive at work.  
  
  
My usual 3 cups of coffee per day? Down to one—and I didn’t miss the rest.  
  
  
My mood was more balanced and positive.  
  
  
 Week 4:  
By the end of the month, I felt like myself again—only better.  
  
  
My energy was consistent, and I had the motivation to exercise.  
  
  
My mental fog had lifted, and my stress responses were more manageable.  
  
  
It genuinely felt like my body and brain were working together again.  
  
  
 What Makes MITOLYN Different?  
Unlike many supplements filled with synthetic fillers or vague herbal blends, MITOLYN includes clinically supported ingredients. Each one plays a role in improving mitochondrial and cognitive health.  
  
  
 Key Ingredients in MITOLYN:  
CoQ10 – A vital antioxidant that fuels mitochondrial energy and supports heart function.  
  
  
PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone) – Stimulates the growth of new mitochondria.  
  
  
Acetyl-L-Carnitine – Enhances brain function, mood, and energy metabolism.  
  
  
Alpha Lipoic Acid – A powerful antioxidant that reduces oxidative stress.  
  
  
Magnesium & B-Complex Vitamins – Essential for nervous system health and stress resilience.  
  
  
This isn’t just a random stack. It’s a synergistic formula designed to create real, sustainable improvements—not just a temporary energy spike.

Let me break down exactly what changed for me after a full month of using MITOLYN:

Mood & Patience Less irritability, more emotional balance  
Sleep Quality Deeper, more restful nights  
Motivation I felt like moving more, even after long workdays  
Overall Wellness A sense of youthful vitality I hadn’t felt in years  
  
  
 Is MITOLYN Safe to Use?  
Safety was my number one concern before purchasing. Thankfully, MITOLYN is manufactured in a USA-based, FDA-registered, GMP-certified facility. It’s also:  
  
  
Non-GMO  
  
  
Gluten-Free

I’ve experienced zero side effects, and based on the formulation, I feel confident recommending it to anyone looking for a clean and effective supplement.

Improved cognition and clearer thinking  
  
  
Better resilience to stress and burnout  
  
  
It’s reassuring to know I’m not the only one seeing these benefits—and the results are consistent across different age groups and lifestyles.  
  
  
 Is MITOLYN Worth the Money?  
In one word? Absolutely.  
  
  
Yes, MITOLYN isn’t the cheapest supplement out there—but it’s actually effective. After wasting hundreds on gimmicky pills that delivered nothing, MITOLYN gave me tangible results.  
  
  
Plus, the brand offers generous bulk-buy discounts, so I now subscribe and save without worrying about running out.  
  
  
Considering how much better I feel physically and mentally, I see it not as an expense—but as a long-term investment in my health.  
  
  
 Final Verdict: Should You Try MITOLYN?  
If you’re dealing with:  
  
  
Low energy and constant fatigue  
  
  
Lack of focus or brain fog  
  
  
Feeling emotionally drained or burned out  
  
  
A desire to restore health at a deeper, cellular level  
  
  
Then yes—MITOLYN is 100% worth a try.  
  
  
What sets it apart is not just what it does, but how it does it. It targets the root causes of energy loss, poor mood, and low motivation—not just masking the symptoms.

A more regular digestive rhythm. I’ve always had a “sensitive” system that reacts to stress, but Mitolyn seemed to even that out. **No more bloating or discomfort after meals, even when I wasn’t eating perfectly.** **Again—not a promise, but a pleasant surprise.**

Lastly, my skin looked subtly clearer and more hydrated. I don’t suffer from acne, but my complexion always leaned dull and uneven. Now? It feels like there’s more color and elasticity in my face. I didn’t even change skincare products—just kept taking Mitolyn.

The truth is, **Mitolyn overdelivered.** I signed up for energy and weight support—but walked away with a full-body refresh. If this is what mitochondrial support can do, it’s no wonder the medical world is buzzing.

**Pros and Cons of Mitolyn – An Honest Snapshot**

I’ve now spent 90 days with Mitolyn. I’ve felt its highs and noted its tiny drawbacks. If you're wondering whether it's for you, here’s my honest take.

Let’s start with the pros. **The most obvious win is daily energy.** Mitolyn doesn’t hype you up like caffeine—it smooths out your entire day. There’s no crash, no jitters, just steady fuel that makes you more productive, alert, and clear-headed. For someone juggling work and life, this is a game-changer.

Another massive pro? **The science-backed formulation.** You can tell this isn’t some slapped-together supplement with fluff ingredients. Mitolyn zeroes in on mitochondrial support, metabolism, and inflammation in a way that’s focused and deliberate. It targets root causes, not just symptoms. I appreciated knowing every capsule was doing serious internal work, even when I didn’t “feel” it right away.

A more regular digestive rhythm. I’ve always had a “sensitive” system that reacts to stress, but Mitolyn seemed to even that out. **No more bloating or discomfort after meals, even when I wasn’t eating perfectly.** **Again—not a promise, but a pleasant surprise.**

Lastly, my skin looked subtly clearer and more hydrated. I don’t suffer from acne, but my complexion always leaned dull and uneven. Now? It feels like there’s more color and elasticity in my face. I didn’t even change skincare products—just kept taking Mitolyn.

The truth is, **Mitolyn overdelivered.** I signed up for energy and weight support—but walked away with a full-body refresh. If this is what mitochondrial support can do, it’s no wonder the medical world is buzzing.

**Pros and Cons of Mitolyn – An Honest Snapshot**

I’ve now spent 90 days with Mitolyn. I’ve felt its highs and noted its tiny drawbacks. If you're wondering whether it's for you, here’s my honest take.

Let’s start with the pros. **The most obvious win is daily energy.** Mitolyn doesn’t hype you up like caffeine—it smooths out your entire day. There’s no crash, no jitters, just steady fuel that makes you more productive, alert, and clear-headed. For someone juggling work and life, this is a game-changer.

Another massive pro? **The science-backed formulation.** You can tell this isn’t some slapped-together supplement with fluff ingredients. Mitolyn zeroes in on mitochondrial support, metabolism, and inflammation in a way that’s focused and deliberate. It targets root causes, not just symptoms. I appreciated knowing every capsule was doing serious internal work, even when I didn’t “feel” it right away.

There’s also **trust built into the brand**—which matters. Everything from how the website explains the sourcing to how they handle customer service screams integrity. Plus, the transparent return policy and lack of shady upsells gave me peace of mind.

Our house sat at the very edge of Pack Land, closest to the human town, but far from other pack members. My father never wanted to be near other......","# Chapter 1 I sat in our Ford F350 truck, pulling a horse trailer behind it, my cheek against the cool window of the truck. Mom was driving now, giving me a break, humming along to some old country song. I wasn't even paying attention to what it was at this point. We had been on the road for three days now. Three long days. I couldn't wait to get there. I let out a loud audible sigh and turned to my mother, ""How much further till we stop? I've gotta pee."" She looked down at the gas gauge and over to the GPS that was on the dash console. She shrugged her shoulders, ""I'd say another twenty minutes till we hit the next gas station. Can you wait that long? Or you want me to pull over and you can find a bush."" She smiled, knowing I did not want to ""find a bush"". Especially not in unfamiliar territory. ""I can wait."" I sat up straighter and reached over to the radio, pushing the eject button for the CD she had playing. ""Hey,"" she looked pissed. ""I was listening to that."" I shrugged. ""It's making me sleepy. We need something more upbeat. I don't know how you can stand to listen to that for hours on end. ""The point dear daughter, IS for you to sleep."" She smiled but it didn't go to her eyes. I stared at Mom for a few minutes. She looked tired. She looked tense. She kept looking in the mirrors, I'm guessing she thought someone would follow us. She had her long hair thrown up in a pony tail, little wisps of her brown curls falling out around her face. My mother was beautiful. She always had been. The bruise on her cheek was now a faded yellow, almost gone. I sighed and looked away, rubbing my sore thigh. We just have to get there, and we would be safe. Three Days Prior I had just graduated Veterinary School. I was home with my mother during the day, a rarity since I was typically at school. But now I was finished. I was Dr. Ashlyn Cane. I was working on my resume and looking over some near by postings for Vets. Mom leaning over my shoulder giving her opinion now and then. She knew more about these places than I did. She had been here most of her life. My father wasn't home. I was glad. He was drunk most of the time. He was loud and over bearing. He spent a lot of time at the bar, hitting on the waitresses and tossing back whiskey like it was water. It took a lot of liquor to get our kind drunk. Werewolves had a high tolerance, since our metabolisms were so fast, it burned off quickly. If I had to guess, I'd say Grady Cane (that was my father, but I rarely called him Dad), drank about two gallons of whiskey a day. His stupor generally lasted long enough for him to fuck some floozy at the bar, and then come home and knock my Mom around a bit. He'd sleep it off and then get up and go to work the night shift at the lumber mill. My opinion of my father, he was a piece of crap. But Mom was mated to him, so she felt the pull that made her stay. She also felt it every time he was cheating on her, pain in her stomach. I would hear her sometimes, laying in her room, crying. I hated him. Mom was just pulling dinner out of the oven, as I was packing up my laptop and papers to go put them away. Grady stumbled in the kitchen door, his eyes instantly on me. ""What the fuck are you doing here?"" he growled out. Um I live here."" I continued to try to make my way to the stairs, to head to my room. He growled at me. Actually growled. I stopped dead in my tracks, looking him in the eyes. His eyes were blood shot, and the smell of liquor was heavy on him. I glanced nervously at Mom, as she set the pot roast on the counter and turned to him. ""Grady, leave Ash alone. She's done with school. She's trying to work on her resume and find a job. Now let's get ready to eat dinner before it gets cold."" Her voice was soft, timid. I knew she was trying to defuse something that I wasn't even truly aware was happening. I glanced back to his face, he was still staring at me. He hadn't even looked Mom's way. ""Don't fucking tell me what to do Carolyn,"" he shifted his gaze to my Mother again. She took a step back from the counter, inching towards the other end of the kitchen island. I stood there, paralyzed. I wasn't sure what I should do, but the moment he lunged for me, I shifted. I was not going to allow him to try and hurt us. Since he was so drunk, he couldn't shift. Grady must have realized what was happening, because he grabbed a kitchen knife that had been laying on the counter and swung it at me, as I lunged at him. It stabbed me in the leg. I whimpered as I hit the floor, blood oozing from my leg. I instantly shifted back to my human form, placing pressure on my thigh. Grady had never hurt me before, but I was also not typically home at the same time as him Mom screamed at him, ""What the hell are you doing Grady?"" I lay on the floor, holding pressure on my wound, as I watched him stalk towards my mother, a menacing look on his face. He had dropped the knife on the floor the instant it hit my leg. I looked at it, then back at him as he kept moving towards my mother.



I watched as Grady slammed his fist into my mothers face. He was huge and my mother was petite, he sent her flying back. Her back hit the refrigerator hard and she slid down it to her butt. ""You don't raise your voice at me! This is my fucking house,""he was seething, his spittle hitting her in the face. Mom sat there with her hand against her eye. She just sat there, looking at the floor, not making eye contact.



I was pissed. I picked up the knife, grabbed my cell phone and limped out the back door. I was going to call my Uncle. He was the Alpha. Our house sat at the very edge of Pack Land, closest to the human town, but far from other pack members. My father never wanted to be near other pack members. He liked his privacy. I would assume so he could terrorize my mother without anyone knowing. Specifically the Alpha.



We had five acres, a pasture out back that was fenced in, and horse barn. I had two horses out in the barn. I had trained them myself, something I was proud of. My father hated that I was talented at taking care of animals. He would always make comments about how he was surprised that someone as weak as me could tame any animal. He was an asshole.



I limped over to the barn, dialing my uncle. He answered on the first ring. ""Hey Ash, heard you graduated! Congrats.""



I whimpered as I bumped my leg on the fence as I climbed through it. He heard me. ""Ash, what's wrong?""



""I think you need to come here as fast as you can. My father is drunk. He stabbed me in the leg and he's inside with Mom. He punched her in the face."" I started crying, something I rarely did.



My Uncle didn't know that my Mom was being abused, she never told anyone. She was embarrassed. She would stay away from the others when she had visible injuries. She told me to never tell Uncle Tobias. This time, I didn't care. My father had to pay. I heard the my Uncle hang up the phone, without so much as a word. I knew it would be just a few minutes before he got there with some of the enforcers.



My Uncle Tobias arrived five minutes later, with his Beta and three enforcers. He saw me sitting in the pasture, my back resting against a fence post, holding pressure on my leg. It had almost quit bleeding. I just needed a couple of stitches so it wouldn't scar, but I couldn't quite get to the barn to grab my suture kit from the office. I was shaking inside. Tobias motioned to his Beta to come to my aid, as he made his way into the house, one enforcer remained outside, his eyes trained on me, and shifting back and force to the screen door that my Uncle had just gone through.



I heard some yelling, but couldn't make out what they were saying. The Beta helped me stand and we made our way to the barn. I quickly cleaned my wound and put a few tight stitches in. We made our way back outside. As were walked towards the house, I suddenly saw Grady get tossed right out the door into the yard, the two enforcers that had been inside were right behind him. My Uncle came out a couple minutes later, carrying my mother in his arms. Her whole face was bloody, her lip busted open and a trickle of blood coming down her forehead. I could hear her softly whimpering.



The enforcers grabbed Grady by his arms, hauling him up. The third enforcer starting pounding into his face. My Uncle said something to them, so quiet I couldn't hear it. They simply nodded, threw Grady in the pack of one their trucks and drove away. My Uncle snapped his head my way, making eye contact. ""Ash, get in the car now. I need to take your mother to the doctor. Then we are going to have a serious chat."" He strode the car, laying Mom down in the back seat. The Beta helped me hobble to the car and get into the back, me gently putting Mom's head in my lap. She sat there crying quietly.



And that is how we ended up leaving Northern California and our beautiful Red Woods forest behind. We both were treated at the hospital, then went to sit with my Uncle as he made a few phone calls. He asked me if I thought I could drive with my leg the way it was. I could. It was my left leg, and the truck was an automatic. We went back to the house, and packed up some things, loaded my horses and tack, and hit the road, heading to Montana. We were going somewhere outside Great Falls. If we were both in tip top shape, it was an easy 2 day drive. But we would need to stop more frequently to let our wounds heal. We weren't going to be able to shift while traveling, it could be dangerous. And shifting was the fastest way to heal.



I had no idea we even had family in Montana, but apparently I had another Uncle, and he was Alpha of the Lone Wolf Stables in Montana. The name was of course a cover up, so the humans didn't catch on. And it really was a horse ranch, which excited me. I was going to be their Veterinarian, much to my surprise. It was part of the deal my Uncle made, so we could start a new life. He didn't want my mother to feel ashamed of what had happened, so he gave her the one thing she asked, let us move away and start over.



# Chapter 2



Ashlynn



We pulled into the little gas station that was seemingly in the middle of nowhere. We were somewhere in Idaho. I thought I saw a sign that said Idaho Falls, but since I was half asleep, I couldn't be sure.



Mom pulled in next to a gas pump, handed me the card, so she wouldn't have to go inside. She didn't want anyone seeing her face. It was still healing, and she didn't want people staring. I opened the door, a little bell jingling as it opened. There was a guy behind the counter reading a magazine. He looked up, his eye catching mine. Instantly I knew, Werewolf. We must have crossed into another Pack's territory. We better make this quick, and get moving.



I walked to the counter, acting like it was no big deal that we were here. I handed him the card, ""Gonna fill up on pump 2 please."" He glanced out the window and saw Mom had pulled the pump handle and was standing there waiting to pump the gas, as she glanced around on high alert.



He snatched the card from my hand and swiped it and handed it back, without a word. ""Thank you sir, can I use the restroom?"" He grunted and pointed at a sign to his right that said restroom. I smiled a thank you and walked to the bathroom. I quickly handled my business and walked out. There was now another guy in the little mini mart. There was no other car outside, so I found this odd, but just kept walking. 



""Hey girl,"" the man from behind the counter said. I turned to look at him, one eyebrow cocked.



""What happened to her face?"" He pointed out the window towards my Mom who was now staring at me through the glass door, all her injuries clearly visible.



""Ummm, she got in a fight."" I didn't know what else to say. Our kind didn't allow domestic violence, it was punishable my death. Speaking of, my father should be nearing his death sentence. Alpha said they would torture him a bit, wait for him to sober up and then deal his sentence.



The other guy in the store approached me. ""You two ladies in some kind of trouble?"" He was looking me up and down. I had on a pair of denim shorts, my now healing wound visible.



Shit, I thought in my head. I looked at the guy behind the counter and back to this other one who felt like he could undress me with his eyes. ""Just passing through to Montana. We are fine."" I went to walk away and the guy grabbed my wrist. 



""You don't look fine."" His voice was soft. I took another look at him, now that he was close. He was handsome, with dark brown hair and two dimples in his chiseled face. He had a five o'clock shadow, which only added to his allure. He had on a pair of cowboy boots and tight wranglers. Any other time I might be inclined to talk more, but we needed to get out of there.



I abruptly pulled my hand back. ""We don't want any trouble. We just have to get back on the road. Thanks for your concern."" I walked as fast as I could to the door, the little bell jingling as I walked out. I looked at my Mom, mind linking her to get in the truck now. Her eyes grew big, as I heard the door open behind me and Mr. Handsome followed me out. He stopped about two feet out of the door and stood with his hands in his pockets, not taking his eyes off me. I jumped into the passenger seat and closed the door, looking back at him as we pulled out. He stood there staring at me as we drove away. I sighed and sunk into my seat, willing Mom to drive faster and get us the hell out of this town.



\*\*\*



We had just turned off the main interstate, somewhere outside Great Falls. I pulled the truck into the huge truck stop. It was filled with huge semi-trucks and big pick ups, some pulling trailers. Mom was asleep in the passenger seat, the seat layed back as far as it would go. She was wrapped in a fuzzy blanket. I looked over at her, tapping her on the shoulder. Then I hopped out to gas up the truck, stretching my back. We were almost there.



Mom must have woke when my door slammed shut. I heard the passenger door close and she walked around the front. ""Hey Ash, I'm going to go inside and use the bathroom. You want some coffee or something?"" I gave her the thumbs up and she pulled her hood up over her head, trying to hide as much of her face as she could.



I leaned back against the truck, closing my eyes for a minute, waiting for the pump to click, signaling it was finished. Once I was done fueling, I took a look around. There was a big grassy patch off to the side of the gas pumps. I pulled my truck in over by the grass and hopped out to exercise the horses. They had been cooped up in that trailer for days now. I had tried to let them out to stretch as much as I could.



Walking back to the rear of the trailer, I swung the door open and latched. I jumped up to grab my horse Bailey and let her stretch. Bailey was a roping horse, and I used her to work the cattle back at our old pack. I was hopeful that she would be of use where we were going. I felt just a little twinge in my leg, as I stretched my leg. It was pretty much healed. The tiniest of scars would remain, but otherwise it felt pretty good.



I was walking Bailey back and forth in the grass, when she stopped, ears perked up. I walked up and rubbed the side of her face, ""What's up girl? You nervous?,"" her nostrils flared at me. I looked around but didn't see anything, then went to put her back in the trailer. I was inside tying her lead rope and backing up Buck. Buck was my gelding. He was a Buckskin, hence his name. I wasn't any more creative than that I guess. Mom comes around showing me my coffee.



""You want me to drive?"" she says sipping her cup.



""Nah I'm good. We are almost there, right?"" I asked, as I stepped out of the trailer, swinging Buck's big butt around to the side of the trailer.



Mom looked around, pulled her phone out of her pocket, checking our location and her directions. ""Yep, looks like we have maybe two more hours. I grabbed us a couple of breakfast burritos from inside. They actually look edible,""she half laughed. ""I'm going to jump back in the truck, I don't like people staring at me. I got plenty of weird looks in there."" She went to walk away. I touched her arm.



""Mom, you need to stop worrying about what other people think. It's all going to be fine,"" she nodded her head. I had to ask her, ""Um, did you scent any other wolves in there?""



She looked back at me, a little smile on her lips. ""Maybe a couple. For sure some cute cowboys in there,"" she winked as she went to the cab of the truck. She knew my weakness.



Pacing Buck up and down the grass for a few minutes, I was talking to him, rubbing his thick dark mane of hair. He was a huge Buckskin. They weren't usually as big as he is, but he was a gentle giant. He didn't spook easily. So when he suddenly stopped short at the back end of the trailer and snorted, I knew something was up. I looked over to the tree line. Standing just barely out of sight was a huge chocolate brown wolf, his sparkling green eyes staring back at me. I wasn't sure what he was doing, if he was trying to scare me, or was just observing. He didn't try to come any closer, and it didn't appear anyone else could see him there. My trailer was blocking the line of sight. When the wolf made no effort to move, I turned and walked Buck to the back of the trailer to load him. I had my eye on the wolf in my peripheral vision.



As I jumped back out of the trailer, and latched the gate shut, the wind shifted and I caught a scent. It was the most amazing scent, like a combination of musk and leather. I tilted my head toward the tree line, the wolf was still there watching me. Oddly, I didn't feel threatened. I walked to the cab, and climbed in. As I closed the door and started up the truck, I took a peek back to the woods. The wolf was gone. Hmm, that was weird.

**Chapter 3**

We made our way down the paved road for a couple hours. We weren't on interstate anymore. It was a two lane, country road. It was mostly lined with trees, and occasional house peeking out here and there. We slowed as Mom guided me to make a right onto a dirt road up ahead. I glanced at the road sign. Red Wolf Road. Well that wasn't obvious or anything.

About five minutes down the dirt road, we came upon a huge gated road. There was a wrought iron sign over head that read Lone Wolf Stables. We had arrived finally. We pulled up to the speaker and I pressed a button. A rough voice answered, ""Who is requesting entrance?""



In the most cheerful voice I could, I announced, ""Carolyn and Ashlynn Cane"". It was quiet for a minute or two. Then the gates started to swing open. I pulled the truck in and the gate quickly shut as soon as the trailer cleared it. I looked around as we had driven through the gate. I saw several cameras pointed to the entrance and what appeared to be a movement sensor. Wow, I thought. Lot's of security.



The road was paved surprisingly. We drove down a long winding road, and suddenly there was a huge clearing, pastures on both sides. They were all fenced with immaculate white wood fence posts and rails. I shook my head, that was a lot of upkeep. There were cattle in one of the pastures and horses in the other. This made me happy. I looked over at Mom, she had a big smile on her face. She must be happy too.



It wasn't long and we came upon, what I can only assume is the main house and stables. The house was three stories with a wrap around porch. It looked like a log house, but huge, stone coming halfway up the front wall. It was beautiful. The main stable looked to be at least two hundred feet in length, it was white with brown trim. As I brought my truck around, I saw a long breezeway in the middle. This was the most beautiful ranch I had ever seen. Mom pointed a spot and told me to park.



We both jumped out, initially it didn't seem like anyone was around. We started to walk towards the main house, when a huge man came out of it, a big smile on his face. He was easily the largest man I had ever seen. He was at least six foot, six inches, and was a wall of muscle. He had dark brown hair and had the same eyes as my mother. I looked over to her and back to him and instantly knew, this was my Uncle. Mom ran up to him and threw herself into his arms. He picked my Mom's tiny figure up and swung her around like a kid. ""Carolyn, it's so good to see you,"" he had a deep voice. It suited him.



My Uncle set my mother down, and looked over at me. ""Well you have to be Ashlynn. I see you got your mothers good looks,"" he winked at me. ""I haven't seen you since you were about two,"" he added. I looked over at Mom confused. I didn't think I had ever met him and she didn't talk about him.



Mom gave me a little smile, ""Ashlynn, this is your Uncle Gabe. He left when you were a toddler to come run this ranch for your great grandfather. He's not been back since. Gabe,""she turned back to him. ""Meet my daughter Ashlynn.""



Uncle Gabe didn't wait for me to move to him, he was so big, he covered the ground in three long strides and picked me up and swung me around too. It was like I weighed nothing. To be fair, I was much taller than my mothers petite 5'3"" frame, she was tiny for a wolf. I was 5'8"", lean muscle, with a round ass that filled out my jeans, and breasts that I often had to lock down in a tight sports bra, especially when I was training or riding horses. ""Welcome home Ashlynn,""my Uncle chuckled when he saw the look on my face that said ""what the heck?""



""You both must be tired. You've on the road for a few days, right?"" he asked. Mom nodded her head. That's when my Uncle took a good look at her face. He suddenly looked pissed, as he walked up to her and grabbed her chin in his hand, turning her face side to side. He let out an angry growl, then dropped his head. ""Carolyn, I wish you would have told Tobias about this when it first started. It wouldn't have gotten to this. And you need to shift so that can finish healing."" He started to walk towards the house. ""Follow me,"" he motioned with his arm as he strode towards the house.



I suddenly felt like I was being watched. I looked towards the stable. There leaning against the frame of the breezeway was the guy I had seen at that gas station in Idaho, the one who had grabbed my wrist. I'm sure my eyes were bugging out of my head as I looked at him. He had on boots, a pair of dark blue wranglers, leather chaps over them, and a button up black shirt. He had on a black stetson, his eyes lasered in on me. It was then that I noticed, even from this distance, he had some of the brightest green eyes I had ever seen. He didn't say anything, just gave me a smirk, pushed off the wall and headed back down the breezeway. I shook my head wondering if it was a mirage, but nope I watched his very nice ass walking away from me.



Uncle Gabe was on the porch. I am not sure he could see what I had been looking at, but he cleared his throat. ""Ash, I see you're admiring the stables. I hope you like it here. Come on in and we will get you guys situated and chat for a bit, then you can put your horses to pasture so they can get some exercise."" His voice snapped me out of my daze.



""Oh um, yeah ok,"" I muttered, walking up to the main house, joining him on the porch. He ushered me in the front door. My eyes fell on my mother, who was seated on a huge leather sofa, her feet curled up under her. She looked relaxed, a cup of tea in her hands. She was talking to a beautiful blonde lady, whom I was guessing was the Luna. My suspicions were correct, when my Uncle introduced me to his mate, Jenna. She was a sweet as she was beautiful.



""So I hope you don't mind, but we are going to put your Mom up here in the main house with us. It's where she belongs,"" Jenna smiled. I looked over at my Uncle and he smiled back and gave me a nod. ""We decided that since you're going to be our Veterinarian here, you should have the loft over the stables. It's where we usually have our previous Veterinarian's stay. It gives the quickest access to the animals and your clinic,"" Jenna went on to say.



""My clinic,"" I breathed out. I was so excited to have my own clinic, but I kind of doubted it was an actual clinic. My Uncle made that theory go out the window immediately when he piped in.



""Yes, we have a full clinic here, complete with a surgical area if it's needed. You have a staff as well, three vet techs. There will always be one on call, any time of the day or night, in the event of emergencies. We have access to any medications you may need, xray's and state of art equipment. These are expensive horses we have here, so only the best for them,"" My Uncle informed me. I just sat there with my jaw on the floor like an idiot.



My Uncle laughed and pushed out of the chair he'd been reclining in. ""Let's go Ash. I will show you to your living quarters and then to the clinic. After that, we can turn out your horses. Sound good?"" he asked as he strolled towards the door.



""Uh yeah, great, "" I replied as we headed out the door. I'm sure I had the stupidest grin on my face, but I couldn't help it. I was suddenly the happiest I'd been in a long time. As I glanced back at Mom, I realized she was also happy. And for the first time since I was little, she looked relaxed. This was going to be good for her.



Dawson



I knew the second that woman turned towards the stable, who she was. She was the one I had tried to talk to at that gas station in Idaho Falls. She wasn't limping anymore, so I could assume that the injury I had seen on her thigh had healed. That's the great thing about being a werewolf, you heal faster than humans. After she left Idaho, I had gone out back and hopped in my Dodge, bidding my cousin good bye. I had been there for his sisters mating ceremony and was now heading back to Lone Wolf Stables, where I had been living and working since I was 18. The Alpha had offered me a place in his pack when he saw me working horses at a trade show in Helena, and I had been here since. It was an honor to work here, it was known for the best horses in the country. My Alpha had no issues with it when I told him I wanted to align with this pack, he knew it was a good opportunity. My Mother was a wreck about it, but she has since grown used to me not being there. I go home a couple times a year to visit and for family events, Alpha Gabe is good about giving us time off when needed.



I had leaned my big frame up against the entry way to the breeze way, just to watch the interaction. When I first heard the truck pull up, I thought it might be our new Veterinarian. I was shocked to see the Alpha hugging the two women. Our hearing is excellent, so when the one named Carolyn introduced Ashlynn to her Uncle Gabe, my jaw about hit the floor. I admit, I had stopped at that truck stop outside Great Falls as well. I was putting gas in my Dodge, when her big F350 pulled up to a pump a few lanes over. I recognized it right away. I knew for sure it was them when I saw her Mom climb out, the remains of a fading bruise on her left cheek bone.



When she pulled her truck over by the grass to stretch her horses legs, I went and parked behind the truck stop, between two semi's and walked into the woods. When I was far enough in, I undressed and shifted. I wanted to get a better look at her. I sat in the tree line for a bit, concealed by a bush. She was good with the horses. I heard her whispering to them, offering comfort. She had her long brown hair pulled back into a baseball cap. She wore no make up, but she was naturally beautiful. She had the most striking blue eyes and long eyelashes, so thick I could see them from my hiding spot. I watched as her wrangler clad ass moved with confidence and ease, as she guided her horses. I caught her scent on the breeze. It was exactly as I remembered it from the gas station. She smelled like fresh rain, and I loved the rain. When I crept forward to the tree line to try and get a better whiff of her scent, her Buckskin alerted her. I stayed perfectly still when her eyes caught mine in the trees. I watched her put her horse back in the trailer and climb into her truck, then I ran back, threw on my clothes and got the heck out of there. What was I even thinking? I needed to get back to the ranch and get to work. I took a short cut down a back dirt road, throwing up dust behind me. I beat them to the ranch by about an hour. Imagine my surprise when she was standing there in front of me a short time later.



It is just my luck that she's the Alpha's niece. She noticed me leaning in the doorway and stared at me. Her mouth was slightly open, a look of utter surprise on her face. I gave her a smirk, and walked my ass away. She was off limits. The Alpha's niece, yeah not happening. I shook my head with disappointment. On a good note, at least I was going to have something beautiful to look at every now and then.



# Chapter 4

Uncle Gabe walked me to the clinic, it was on the back side of the stables. It was huge, and as he had stated, everything was state of the art. The clinic was immaculately clean. When we walked in, there was one young guy behind the counter. He looked to be about twenty or so. ""Hey Mike, this is Ashlynn Cane. She's our new vet. Ash, this is Mike, he's one of your vet techs."" We said our hellos and then toured around the facility. I think I was still in shock. So much was happening and so fast. It was exciting and scary as hell, all at the same time.



When he took me to my ""loft"" above the stables, I had to laugh. It was not the type of lofts I had seen. It was actually a two bedroom apartment. It had a big kitchen, with a center island, stainless steel appliances and granite counter tops. It was nicer than our house back in California. It had beautiful furniture and an amazing view. The large picture window in the living area, looked out over the arena and to the mountain back drop that sat behind us. My Uncle looked at me with a smirk on his face, ""I trust this will do?""



""Will it ever! This is so beautiful Uncle Gabe. I'm in shock. Thank you for everything, "" I threw myself at him and gave him a big hug. I wasn't actually much of a hugger but he made me feel cared about and taken care of. I knew now why my Mom had so enthusiastically threw herself into his arms when we arrived. He really was a great guy.



My Uncle chuckled. It was a deep warm sound. I loved it. ""Ok Ash, lets take a walk around the place. I will introduce you to some of the more important people. You will be working with my Ranch Foreman quite a bit. He's also my lead horse trainer. You will need to meet my livestock manager. He handles the cows. I've also got a bunk house manager, not that you will be in the bunk house,""he gave me a look to say not allowed, and I laughed. ""You will need to know where to find the cowboys and cowgirls, should you need anything with the horses.""



""Cowgirls?"" I asked. I was actually excited to meet some girls who might have the same interests as me, and a cowgirl sounded like just the type.



""Yep, we have three on staff here. Hard working ladies. All three of them grew up here, so they know the land like the back of their hands. That would be a good way to start learning your way around the mountain, hang out with the girls. They are close to your age,"" we had just stepped out through the breeze way. The quiet I had seen out front was just an illusion, because it was not quiet out here. There was stuff going on every where. There was a cowgirl cantering a horse around the arena, it bucked a couple times and she held on. Clearly it was green broke and she was working it.



A few corrals behind the arena, I saw four cowboys, roping calfs, and hauling them to the ground for branding. There was another stable off to the left, two cowboys stood talking, next to a hitching post. They were deep in conversation, talking about a heifer that was about to give birth, as we walked up behind them. I instantly recognized that ass in those wranglers. He visibly stiffened when we approached, turning towards us. ""Alpha,"" he said tipping his black stetson. The other guy did the same, and then shifted his eyes to me and back to the Alpha.



""Afternoon, gentleman. I'd like to introduce our new Veterinarian, Ashlynn Cane. She's also my niece, so don't give her to hard of a time boys."" He gave them a smile, as he draped his big arm over my shoulder.



""Ashlynn, this is Dawson, my Ranch Foreman,"" He gestured to the hottest guy I'd ever seen. I'm sure my face turned fifty shades of red. ""And this is my Livestock Manager, Cody."" He gestured to the other guy.



Both of them stared at me for a second, Cody the first to come forward, his hand extended to shake mine. ""Welcome Ashlynn. We will be working together a lot during breeding season and calfing season."" I took his hand and gave him a firm handshake.



""Nice to meet you Cody. I look forward to it,"" I smiled.



Dawson was giving Cody a snear, as he stepped closer to me. ""Strange how we meet again huh? Nice to officially meet you Ashlynn,"" he said with a smirk. His eyes seemed to stare right into my soul. He hung onto my hand just a little longer than he needed to, then dropped it.



""You've met before?"" Uncle Gabe asked. ""When?""



Dawson looked up to my Uncle, it seems everyone has to look up at him. Dawson was not short either, probably six foot three if I were guessing. ""Yes sir. I saw her a the gas station in Idaho Falls, the day I was coming back from visiting my family. We spoke briefly."" That was all the explanation he gave, as he tipped his hat to me and began to walk away. ""See ya around, I've gotta get back to work."" He walked away, heading towards one of the stables.



""Well Ash, it's about time we get your horses out, don't ya think,"" my Uncle guided me back towards the front of the main stable. He didn't appear to even notice the odd tension between myself and Dawson. Huh, so that was his name. It was fitting. Tall, dark stranger with alluring green eyes. Who would have thought we'd come across each other again.



Dawson



I had to get away from her as quickly as possible. She was even more beautiful up close. And she smelled amazing. I couldn't help my irritation when Cody took her hand first, for some reason I didn't like it. I had to keep repeating in my head, the Alpha's niece. The instant my hand touched hers, I felt a warmth spread through me. When I realized I hadn't let go of her hand as quickly as I should, I admit I got nervous that the Alpha would notice.



I had work to do anyway. We had just gotten in a stallion that needed some calming down. I turned on my heel, feeling an uncomfortable hardness in my jeans. I had to get away from her. No woman had ever affected me like that. I knew I felt a draw to her at that gas station, her scent was intoxicating, but now that I was actually going to be working in her presence, I was going to have to put up a wall. This was no good.



I heard the Alpha leading her away. I turned back to look, seeing them walking back down the breezeway to the front. Her perfect ass was swaying as she walked. I could see her profile as she looked up at her Uncle, she was smiling. She had a little dimple in that cheek. How I wanted to kiss it. Let's be honest, I wanted to kiss every inch of her. I turned back towards the stable I was heading too, I was going to need to go for a run, or take a cold shower. Maybe both. The Alpha's niece. Off limits. The mantra playing over and over in my head.

I’ve been struggling with mental health for about 5 years now with a few brief stints of good periods. My place had been getting extremely messy as of late. Dirty clothes everywhere. Clothes basket was overflowing. Dust and grime all over. Dishwasher full of clean dishes and dirty dishes piling up on the counter. Empty takeaway bags and containers all over the living room and kitchen.

I cleaned all of it. My floors are dust free, clothes all hung up neatly, bed made, bathroom spotless, dishes put away. Empty kitchen sink. I wish I could have that energy when I’m alone. 

I still have this sense of apathy though. Like I was proud of myself for cleaning but I didn’t really do it for myself.

I think the worst part of it all was that I feel they only came to stay so they didn’t have to pay to stay elsewhere because it’s expensive to stay in my city. They were out all evening until 1 am. When I realised they’d be gone for longer than I thought I set up the air bed they brought so the pump didn’t disturb the neighbours and me when they got home. This happened a previous time which is why I expected them to know this time around. 

I did some shopping the day before so I could cook them breakfast in the morning. They said no and instead said they want to go out and buy coffee and pastries from an expensive overrated cafe that is popular on social media. They invited me but it just felt like a “we already planned on going to this so you can come or not” invite. I went along just to maybe spend some time. They ordered their food and then I bought myself something. Now I don’t ever expect anything from anyone but this time I at least would’ve liked an offer after I already bought things to cook for breakfast. We had to queue for 30 minutes to get a mediocre pastry and coffee. Sat down for maybe an hour and then they had to rush off to some other event back home. 

None of it really felt like they wanted to spend any real time with me and just needed a place to stay for free. Am I overthinking it? Should I feel good about doing something productive that benefits me even if it was not really for me?",1,1750703906.0,depression,2,1.0,False
1lioll3,https://i.redd.it/uxtk2gdf1q8f1.jpeg,Please be careful of scammers near Uni,"Firsr time posting here in Reddit, just wanted to share this event that happened to me last June 13, 2025 (Friday). So, I'm planning on posting to some subreddits. Used ChatGPT here to translate the original post into English.

Sure! Here's a translated and Reddit-ready version of your post :
---

I was flying to Toronto that day. My luggage was mostly packed—only thing left was to bottle up the poop I had just taken (is “feces” more polite?) and walk across the street from my apartment at One12 near uni to the testing center near Hmart to get it analyzed. Since it was so close, I didn’t bring anything except my wallet and the poop.

Unexpectedly, just as I walked out, a car suddenly pulled up next to me. I thought it was a family of three who had gotten lost and needed directions. But as soon as they opened their mouth, it was a flood of words: “I lost my wallet, we’re from Dubai, we’re here traveling, we need money to buy plane tickets to go back.” (later, I noticed the settings on their screen wasn't Arabic at all but rather resembling that of Turkish. The more I think afterwards that they were most probably refugees).

Yes, at the time, I wasn’t even expecting to give them a lot of money—just wanted to help them. But I told them my debit card only had 1,000, and they pushed for more. They told me to use a credit card to get a cash advance, and wanted me to take out 10,000.

At that moment, they even said “Don’t worry, brother,” and asked for my name, phone number, and nationality (thereafter kept addressing me by ""Filipinah bruddah"" with their heavy accents). It was like they were trying to brainwash me. They kept saying things like “Don’t worry,” and swearing to their god with “wahallah bismillah shit,” saying they definitely weren’t scammers, they 1000% would return the money, and even more on top of that. Hypocrites... Fake followers of Islam. The guy even me all the ""gold"" accessories that he was wearing, saying keep that as deposit, and wait until we go back to Dubai, we'll give you double triple of that. I said I didn't want to, how about using my credit card instead. But they were very persistent and I wasn't sure since I'd say I help them if this is too much help being given to a stranger. I don't know if it was the gold or the smell or just peer pressure from all of them that I stepped into their car and they drove me to my RBC Bank branch near Whyte Ave.

Luckily, just as I was about to walk in the branch, I bumped into a white middle aged woman, chatted with her briefly—she also said she was there to get cash. I interrupted her and explained my situation, that I felt I was being coerced indirectly to withdraw money, and even showed her the gold necklace, ring, and watch they gave me. I didn’t know how to tell if it was real or not, and I didn’t have my phone with me, so I believed them. They left after staying in the bank and called security. Really thankful for God for the intervention of bringing in nice Canadians!

Good thing in the end, I didn’t leave anything behind in their car—just the poop. 😊

From now on, when it comes to money, my default response is:
""You can f* off.""**
Or, go to the cops.

At most, I’ll buy someone a coffee at Tims.

“How about you give me $100 first, and I’ll see if I can help you.”

My God beat their ""Allah"" today.

我当天就要飞多伦多了，行李差不多收拾好了，剩下就是把刚拉完的屎（大便更好听吗？）放在瓶装准备走过对面的楼送到检测中心去测。当时，就因为很近啥都没带，只带钱包和大便。

没想到，我一出门儿，突然有个车靠我这边的，我以为那一家三口的是迷路了，想指路，结果一开口就是哗啦啦的我钱包丢了，我们是迪拜人，我们来这边旅游的，需要金钱买机票回国

对的，我当时没指望着拿更多的钱，而是来帮这些人。但我说我储蓄卡只有1千，然后他们要更高了，让我用信用卡取钱（cash advance，不知道中文怎么说），要让我拿1万

那时候，还他妈说，放心兄弟，还问到了我名字我电话号码和国籍，好像给我洗脑了，说，放心，他们向他们真主发誓wahallah bismillah shit，绝对不是骗子，1000%会还钱，甚至会换更多到时候

幸好开门的时候，也碰到了白女人，然后跟我聊一两句也要取现金，然后我就打断了她，解释了我的情况，也给了她看他们交给我的什么黄金项链，戒指，手表，不知道怎么分辨真假，加上手机没在身边，就信了他们

还好最后，没什么东西落在他们车里，只有拉的屎。[Smile]

以后涉及到钱，统一回复，你给我滚吧。

I can't explain any of this shit to a therapist because talk therapy (at least in my area) is rehashed evangelism for leftists. Any time I try to have a serious conversation or seek help, I'm told that I'm ungrateful and that I'm choosing to stay miserable. I'm starting to think CBT is rehashed evangelism for leftists as they refuse to intervene on stuff that actually matters.

Nothing good ever fucking matters anymore because I return right back to the shithole (literally) and starve myself or an item I really like gets ruined from all the roaches and mice (or mold). Every time I get asked about the ""positive"", it feels like they're just derail the conversation about me needing basic safety first and foremost.

It often takes decades just to get a response and I'm left to suffer in complete filth no matter where I'm at. Our parents aren't able to be placed in a nursing home despite how ill they are, and my older sister (legal guardian) is worried about losing her state job as a social worker (she talks shit about her clients all the time).

It same shit every fucking day. I tell my therapist what happened since we last met, and then at the end of the session they ask if anything positive happened. The reason I never talk about anything good in my life is because I'm living in complete squalor and am literally unable to enjoy nice things because of it. 

I can't just leave because mental health is still relatively ""new"" where I live and everything else is shutting down due to being a rural area. I had to leave the other place because group therapy got overrun by a nepo baby girlboss that would constantly scream at clients over the most basic misunderstandings and stalk them on social media (upper management does not care).

Everywhere else is basically a run down shitshow out of somebody's private house that's on the verge of caving in. The people that go there absolutely hate it and give up on going all together. Literally nobody attends anything anymore because of how badly run everything is. Mental health doesn't really exist in places where Dollar General is the only chain store for miles.

The reason I'm so hesitant to have a room mate because I've already been fucked over nearly every goddamn day since I was a toddler. It's so bad that I constantly worry to death about getting raped in my sleep by deadbeats on meth. To make this unpredictability seem like some whimsical coin toss makes me even less inclined to have a roommate than I already was. 

Literally every single person in the entire community (regardless of whether it's inside the group home or out in public) who exists below a certain tax bracket looks like they come straight from Hoarders TV. All the normal people have already moved the fuck away and don't want anything to do with me. It's not even a matter of surrounding myself with the ""right"" people anymore when everyone I come across is absolutely unhinged as fuck.

I don't have anything against homeless folks trying to get by, but I'm tired of being forced to hang around middle aged women who don't have a lick of damn sense. Age doesn't always equate maturity, especially in areas where nobody has basic manners except for myself. Even when I go out to eat with the women at church, I have to plug my ears because it's absolutely noisy as fuck on the way there and all they ever fucking talk about is their dead relatives from 50 years ago.

I wouldn't even have an issue with a roommate if the local population wasn't absolutely trashy as fuck with everyone living in total squalor and no respect for anyone around them. All I ask is that my next door neighbors don't stack rotten trash to the ceiling and my windows are safe from stray bullets, and yet everyone treats it like some impossible task.

I'm tired of being fucked over since I was a baby. I don't have a home yo go back to if things go south. I can't afford to replace my belongings when they get stolen for drug money or ruined beyond repair. Everything to my name is in a storage unit in order to protect it from to getting stolen by residents at the facility (kleptos will wander into other people's rooms and start digging through their dressers). 

It's so fucking bad that I have no longer have any sense of object permeance regardless of how many items I actually have. Even in a perfectly clean environment with next to no clutter, I still lose track of everything under the sun. I can't remember where anything is placed or if I locked up my storage unit.

Whenever I bust my butt cleaning my side of the room, everyone else in the facility leaves out rotten food that attracts all kinds of flies and I've honestly given up trying to organize because of it. I can't even step outside anymore because it smells like a corpse from all the cigarettes, spit, empty cans, dumped leftovers, and urine.

The reason I left the other place is because I got tired of evangelists screaming at me while living out in the middle of buttfuck nowhere and my family won't let me move towards anything barely resembling a city. I had guys at the evangelist group home catcall me and tear up everything in sighr while my family did nothing to check in on me.

Every last ounce of research on available programs that I need in order to become independent (which are pretty much exclusive to dense metropolitan areas) is met with constant bitching about how I'm gonna get shot to death by black people and illegal immigrants. My family sees me as their precious ""forever baby"" and there's no getting out of it.

My sister is deathly afraid of me speaking to cops like one of those fake white chicks that are overly hypervigilant about being a liberal and try to insert themselves into every political issue ever. I know police are generally rude and often brut, but my sister's ""concern"" is based on her perception of cops being pigs through TikTok memes rather than caring about my safety as a human being.

She constantly complains about how nobody will be able to visit me in case of an emergency, but in all honesty I'd rather just die alone since nobody in the family gives two fucks about my actual wellbeing as a person. I can't even go to the doctor because all they ever do is gossip with my sister the whole time. My whole life I've been limited to the nuclear family structure of parents and one older sibling because everyone else sees us as white trash.

My sister's side of the family is overworked to fucking death and she doesn't want me around her kids because they're teens and ""need space"" (they're glued to TikTok literally 24/7 with no life skills). I usually sit on the couch with my face buried in a screen all over again because nobody ever offers to talks to me. I'm barely able to do anything but lay there on the couch without her accusing me of tearing the house up.

Whenever I ask to come over to her house to avoid the squalor at our parents, she talks all condescending like I'm disrupting her life. I get being busy at times, but she did that to herself and it's clear that she doesn't really want me involved in her life anymore. She accuses me abusing her animals even though she tried to breed my guinea pigs when I was a teen cause she joked about having a guinea pig farm. I only use my parents for free money or food and that's really it as I have no energy to be sympathetic for them anymore.

It feels like that one episode of Hoarders where the kids were brought in to see an update only for the house to still look like complete shit after being ""cleaned up"". Animal waste is layered into the majority of the living room floor, the wallpapper is ripped up and peeling away from the wall, and the tiles in the hallway are chipped. Comments were also made about how the house is physically destroyed and won't pass inspection while the owners will never have the income or mental ability to fix it.

I feel like I'm being put into this same exact position where my standards of living are completely nonexistent because I've ever known is complete squalor. When everyone around me has a mental breakdown over the existence of black people, I don't even see the point in trying to set up basic goals that I can't even follow through with because of from all the filth. I don't really qualify for anything because I literally cannot work on the life skills I need in order to participate in the program.

My therapist always wants to use the ""perfect world where anything can happen"" crutch like I'm in kindergarten all over again, but I don't even know how to fucking respond anymore because wanting basic safety/cleanliness with no strings attached is somehow too much for them to handle.

I never share my goals with anyone is because they're clearly unobtainable from where I'm at, no matter how small they are. Even if I live well under my means to the point of pretending that I'm impoverished, I would still have to maintain a sense of structure and cleanliness. Animal control has refused to do anything time and time again since pets are still considered private property where I live.

Commiting myself to a dirty ass nursing home full of chain smokers and child molesters is the only way I can eat, sleep, or bathe because of all the squalor at my parents. I have absolutely nobody else to take me in since they're all preppy skinheads who kiss the ass of Fox News. I'm not allowed to really keep contact with anyone outside of my immediate family.

My hometown is a literal fucking shithole full of trailer trash deadbeats and everything outside the church is shutting down. There's absolutely no way in fucking hell their decision isn't fueled by prejudice because I'm constantly inhaling animal waste while they let all the crackheads in the basement get away with everything.

At one point, they forced me to live out in the country with radicalized evangelists that unironically needed to be placed in a psychiatric hospital. Staff would steal hundreds of dollars out of residents' depositories, I had my phone stolen out of the office and crushed by another resident after it was revoked, staff were forced to drive an entire van on ice just to sing in the choir, and black mold was in the vents for around two years before I moved there.

Literally the only time they showed any concern was when I was sexually assaulted on public transportation by a black man, even then they didn't really give a fuck at all other than the fact he was black. Staff whistled at me and treated me like a dog for defending myself from him.

My family goes around claiming that they only let me leave because I threatened to kill myself, which wasn't even true. The honest truth is that I told them that the place was being reported to the state by staff for withholding paychecks and at risk of shutting down so I needed a back up plan.

I've fought tooth and nail to relocate to where the services I need are available, and I've just given up trying because my family doesn't want me around anyone with nonwhite skin. Packing my bags and walking out is impossible because they say I'm too disabled to be living on my own.

I'm literally sitting around just waiting for our parents to die already because of how bad things are. However, they've laid around like this my entire fucking life of 24 years and it's all I've ever known out of them. I don't have the energy to feel bad about their because that's just how they've ways been around me. I don't even feel like attending their funerals because of how poorly they treated me.

All three of us think my mother is suffering from the copius amounts of lithium in her system, possibly suffering from subdermal hematoma from falling or possibly a brain tumor. She leaves stuff behind and doesnt know where she is half the time. I can't even keep up with my medication because it gets lost on the coffee table, which my sister constantly screams about.

Not only do ambulances reject her based on her ability to answer what day it is, but she is known for her refusal to seek help and actively tried to fight against staff the last time she was hospitalized around half a decade ago due to lung issues. nobody gives a fuck.

My father is a hoarder and has essentially trashed the fucking house ever since he moved in. There is no chance of ever getting that house clean as long as he is alive. What seperates him from other hoarders is that he actively craves filth. He's contributed to the roach infestation by tenfold from laying in his own sweat until the mattress turns black and has even resorted to pissing in cups.

He's way too overly competent to be placed in any type of nursing home (think Einstein but deadbeat), so he's basically gonna make himself sick until he falls over and dies. I'm literally fucking shocked at how he hasn't gotten sepsis yet from all the roaches, mice, mold, and dog shit.

Neither of them can take care of the house and the floors are layered to death in animal waste from the crackhead squatter in the basement. It still wasn't as bad as the people we bought the house from (they hoarded animals), but my parents are actively making the roach situation worse by their inability to do anything.

My sister could be trying to get proper care for them instead of treating me like a literal infant every time I open my mouth, but it's an endless cycle of her feeling obligated to post the grandkids on Facebook to make our mom look good and turning around to block her number. My sister had this issue of kissing up to everyone's ass and then complaining about them using her or being ungrateful.

My sister doesn't trust me with a single goddamn thing ever because her three kids (all with different baby daddies) would terrorize the fuck out of me (and each other) growing up under the same roof. Just a few weeks ago she accused me of being too rough on the cat at her house when I literally had my arm dangling over the couch with no intentions of petting it.

She's not responsible enough to be a guardian (let alone a parent) and her kids go on about how she's gonna ell the house after they so she can travel the US in an RV with one of her gay male friends. I know out but come the fuck on, she shouldn't be basing the rest of her life on a glorified TikTok trend. With the way she treats me (and everyone else in general), I'm absolutely confused as fuck to why she wants me to move in with her when I'm 30.

It often takes decades just to get a response and I'm left to suffer in complete filth no matter where I'm at. my family isn't to be placed in a nursing home despite how sick they are, and my sister is worried about losing her state job as a social worker (she talks shit about her clients all the time).

I'm stuck in this rut of my sister not being responsible enough to be a guardian while also being the only one in th world who understands how legal stuff works and would be able to catch me trying to repeal it almost instantly (even if I did it anonymously). Im severely dependent because of the neglect I faced growing up and can't work on building my independence due to all the squalor/theft/harassment/etc.

State guardians are so insanely overbooked and unserious about their jobs that getting one would permanently condemn me to a halfassed nursing facility that's overcrowded with child molesters that go around harassing female residents while crackheads keep smuggling meth into the building.

Ombudsmen don't really exist in our area, nor are they remotely concerned for residents quality of life when they show up once every few years. It's clear that all these middle aged white women view working with the state as an infinite money glitch instead of doing their actual fucking job. I've even been told to fuck off by social workers back in highschool and nothing has changed.

Everyone always wants to treat group therapy as the one way ticket into getting an apartment, but I don't feel safe enough to leave my room for an extended period of time (nor do I have any activities to go home to outside of staring at a screen until the battery dies). I would gladly sign up for it if I didn't have to worry about my stuff being pillaged through while I'm gone (happened to me a lot as a kid up until now) or transporting bugs everywhere (which has also happened for a good while despite my best efforts).

There's an absolute shit ton of stuff that I want to do that everyone else takes for granted, like owning a pet without it being abused, just being able to chill after work without being stuck in total filth or listening to people scream, and being able to go to bed at night without bugs crawling all over me (whether it be flies or roaches). That's what I'd consider my ""perfect world"", but it's not good enough for anybody.

My body is slowly starting to succumb to all the filth and I can barely move around anymore because of how much pain I'm in. I'm scared to take my meds at night because I'm afraid someone is going to do something to me or my property while I'm asleep. No amont of fuckass quirkchungus vibes is going to fix my health or my brain. I'm just at a loss of what to do anymore.

I'm supposed to hear back from something being announced in September, but all my personal belongings at the storage unit are already getting moldy just after a month of owning it (I can't afford to replace them) and I just don't have time to wait around on my ass for shit anymore.",3,1750703743.0,CPTSD,4,0.72,False

Ok,"Ah yes, nothing screams “corporate genius” quite like Sherwin-Williams deciding the best way to compete with a home improvement behemoth like Home Depot is… to open earlier.

Because when I think of a multi-billion-dollar chain with tens of thousands of SKUs, a garden center, a tool rental counter, a snack aisle, and enough plywood to rebuild Noah’s Ark, I think:
“The only edge they have over us is that they open at 6AM.”

Of course! It’s not the hundreds of employees, the warehouse-sized layout, or the ability to sell literally everything from drywall anchors to inflatable hot tubs. No no. it’s those extra 60 minutes in the morning that are just killing us.

So now, instead of rolling out of bed at 6:30, slamming a gas station coffee, and dreading another day of mixing emerald urethane until my soul evaporates, I get to do all that at 5:30AM! All to compete with a place that sells 2x4s and chicken coops in the same aisle.

Can’t wait for the 5:45AM phone call from a contractor who wants 40 gallons of ProMar 200 tinted to Sherwin-Williams Krypton, but also wants to know why we don’t carry light switches, tile grout, or functioning air conditioning.

It’s also ridiculous to to think that all of these understaffed stores with not enough staff that are already burning out and strapped are well equipped to get the job done and cover all the extra hours.

This plan has big “We don’t know what we’re doing but we’ll die on this hill anyway” energy.
Sherwin-Williams: Where we think morning hours will magically make us Home Depot, but we still don’t carry extension cords.

This company has no idea what the hell it’s doing and all of the quality employees have already said “fuck this place” and have ‘up and left’.",41,1750703726.0,sherwinwilliams,17,0.89,False

Worth it or waste of time?,"So I gave Facebook Dating a shot this past month just out of curiosity. I’m in my early 30s, live in a smaller city, and I’ve been single for a bit after a long relationship. I figured maybe using something tied to a real profile would help weed out the fake stuff. Spoiler: it kinda does, but also kinda doesn’t.

The setup was quick and pretty straightforward. What I liked at first was how it showed people with mutual interests or groups in common. One guy I matched with was actually in a local hiking group I forgot I even joined. We chatted for a few days, he seemed normal, even had a dog and posted about his mom’s birthday recently. Then poof, he unmatched after I suggested grabbing coffee. No explanation. That kinda set the tone for the rest of my experience.

There were a few nice convos but most felt dry or just ghosted after a few messages. One dude immediately started trauma dumping like three messages in. Another clearly hadn’t updated his profile since 2019 and was using blurry pics from a wedding I swear I’ve seen reposted in meme pages.

It’s not all bad though. I did meet one guy who’s actually been consistent and normal (which is a win these days), but we haven’t met up yet. I don’t have high hopes, just taking it slow.

Curious if others are having better luck? Is it just me or is Facebook Dating like the awkward middle child between Tinder and Hinge?",1,1750703689.0,productreview,0,1.0,False
1liohir,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1liohir,First Family Road Trip…,"In our 25 MY LR AWD was a success!! The wife, our soon to be two year old and myself traveled from Westchester County, NY to Cape Cod about 240-250 miles.

Not super far but just enough to get rid of our range anxiety and learn how the cars navigation really works on road trips. It was awesome to see the amount of superchargers spread out throughout I95 and also seeing how the car adjusts and just does its thing.

First thing I asked my wife before heading out was at what percent battery did she feel comfortable arriving at our AirBnB and she said 45%. I said ok, plugged it into the car and it had us stop once about 2hr 15min into the trip and charge for about 10min. We ended up going to a Starbucks nearby to grab some coffee and get the gremlin out her car seat (let the car charge for a little more). Total drive up took 5hrs instead of the estimated 4.5hrs, no complaints!

The drive back took 7hrs 😞😞😞. Getting off the Cape took forever and of course traffic on the I95 was all over the place. This time I didn’t ask my wife about the arrival percentage and it had us stopping once at a supercharger with a SOC of 15%. We ended up stopping before that to use the restrooms and stretch at another service center that ended up having superchargers so we just plugged in there!

Our Airbnb had a level 2 NEMA 14-30 outlet (I purchased the mobile adapter ahead of time). Now I fully understand the benefits of having home charging lol, I couldn’t help but smile knowing that each day we were there Sexxxy Red was going to be waiting for us the next morning with an 80% charge! 

We don’t have home charging but supercharging hasn’t been an inconvenience as we hardly drive back home and work from home but I cannot wait to have our house next year  with some level of charging.

Highlights:
1. Wife doing most of the driving on the Cape.
2. At one point on the way up she says from the back, “we have so much space back here, I think we’ll be ok with the two kids 😂 (we expecting another gremlin).
3. How accurate the SOC at your arrival is!
4. Seeing a model 3 fly by on I95 with the driver on his phone with both hands and one leg up on the dash.
5. Awesome how comfortable of a road trip car the MY is in terms of passenger comfort, space and performance. I only used Autopilot for this trip and have no complaints. Didn’t feel any driving fatigue.

I’m definitely looking forward to more trips with my growing little family!

1liogp1,https://www.reddit.com/r/toddlers/comments/1liogp1/our_daughter_might_be_placed_in_foster_care_and/,"Our daughter might be placed in foster care, and I'm not okay. This is a long post, but any advice is appreciated.","I don't know how to stop feeling like I'm failing my daughter.

I'm not even sure how to fit everything into one post, so I'll have to be kind of vague about some parts of this.

My wife and I recently spent 6 months homeless with our now 2.5yo daughter. It was truly at no fault of our own. We were evicted from our apartment (that we lived in for 8 years) when they decided to convert the apartments into a ""luxury living community"". We lost at least 90% of our belongings in the process. Multiple other people/families were evicted within the same month that we were. Theres a bit more to it than that (how they got away with it) but I don't want the backstory for this to be too long.

When we lost the apartment, it impacted our daughter more than we thought it would. Everyone told us that toddlers are so resilient, that as long as we were with her, she would still feel safe.
She's always been a quiet, observant, and sensitive kid, even as an infant. She never cried unless something was very wrong. She took great naps, and had been sleeping through the night since around 6 months old, in a crib in her own room.

On our first night after leaving the apartment, in a hotel, she started crying just before bedtime. My wife and I both couldn't soothe her. We did everything we normally would. We even put on her favorite movie at the time (Frozen 2), let her lay in bed with us, etc. She cried  for hours until eventually falling asleep. She then woke up crying every hour through the night.
That same thing continued for about 10 days, but not only at night time. She cried until vomiting on more than one occasion. Sometimes, she wouldn't even let us hold her. She would just lay face down on the floor crying and hyperventilating, yelling ""Home! Home, mama! Dada, home!"". It was excruciating not being able to help her.

After she adjusted a bit, and wasn't constantly crying.. she also stopped talking. She'd say a few words, like ""mama"" ""dada"" ""milk"", etc but she stopped saying anything else. She stopped the baby talk/babbling. Like I said, she's always been on the more quiet and calm side, but this was different.

For the next few months, we moved around often. Usually staying in not in the best areas, not the best hotels. My wife works full time in a management position for a local shop, and at the time I worked from home in a sales position. Still, we were on an extremely tight budget. Even the cheapest hotels in our area were around $600/week, and most of them only had availability for 4-5 days at a time.

We don't have any family nearby, so that wasn't an option for us. We tried a couple of Airbnb's, but they ended up being even more expensive. Homeless shelters in the area were full and generally not safe for young kids (only some people get a room, everyone else sleeps together in the kitchen on floor mats and cots). We ended up ""sleeping"" in our car occasionally, with one of us staying awake and holding our daughter while the other got some sleep. The whole experience was truly horrific.

We applied to over 40 apartments and houses, paying between a nonrefundable $30-50 application fee for each one, until we finally found a private landlord who agreed to work with us after we explained the situation regarding the prior eviction, and after showing him copies of our rental payments (we were only late on rent 3 times over the years, and only by less than a week).

We moved into the new house in January of this year. It was such a relief to be back into stable housing. On top of that, our daughter has her own bedroom and bed again, which helped her a lot. Weve slowly bought back some toys and activities for her, and we have a large fenced in backyard here, so she has all of that space to play outside. Since weve been here, we've got her started in speech therapy through early intervention, and she's finally started to eat more, gain weight again. She's doing great with her speech, and she overall seems happy, and much more like herself again. Even her sleep has improved, especially now that we have a stable bedtime routine again. She still has nightmares on occasion and wakes up at least once a night, but it's a huge improvement.

While things are much better for our daughter now, things have not been okay overall. Things are so bad financially, and I'm terrified that we're going to end up homeless again.

I work from home because I am physically disabled due to a combination of a genetic condition and prior spine and leg injuries, (in addition to being able to stay home with our daughter). My condition causes extreme chronic pain, and I also have a heart condition that requires specific medication. I am able to live a generally ""normal"" life, but I do have a lot of challenges that I have to adjust for (can't be out in the heat for long, have to follow a specific diet, supportive bracing so I can walk, etc).

3 months ago, my work hours were cut in half suddenly. They told me that they didn't need the additional help on one of the projects I was a part of. So my income is now less than half of what it was.

We got behind on our rent back in March, we were late by 2 weeks. Our landlord was understanding, but we've been playing catch up since and we've been late by about 7-10 days each month.
This month, we were short on June rent, and our landlord accepted a partial payment but he is frustrated. He told me that if we don't pay at least $1900 on or before July 1st (1250 for july rent, and the remainder of June rent) that we will be given a 3 day notice, and if we don't pay within those 3 days he will file for eviction. He also said that he will not renew our lease after this lease ends if we are late even one more time within this lease. We will have nowhere to go if we cant stay here. It took us 6 months of constantly applying, calling, etc to even find someone who would rent to us.

I have no idea how we're going to pull this off. Our total income in the next 2 weeks is only 1,400. So we are 500 short just for the rent. That doesn't include any of our utilities, any food for our daughter, diapers/pull ups, gas for the car, etc.

I've been doing everything to find a new job. I've applied to over 200 jobs over the past 2 months, even some that I wouldn't normally consider. I'll take just about anything at this point.

In the meantime, I've had to stop taking all of my medications, including my heart medication and medication for my severe chronic pain. My wife had to stop taking her antidepressant and ADHD medications. We can't afford to pick any of them up.

We don't qualify for assistance of any kind, our income in just above the limits. The only thing we have access to is the food pantry, which does help, but is not enough. Most days, my wife and I both go without eating anything just to make sure our daughter has enough. We eat maybe a granola bar or some crackers for days in a row. Right now, we are almost out of milk for her and we only have 4 pull ups left, but we cant even go to the pantry again for another week.

I've been doing 8+ hours of Doordash deliveries almost every night, which makes just barely enough to keep the electric on and keep gas in the car for my wife to get to work and back.

I know it's graphic, but I end most of my Doordash shifts vomiting from the sheer amount of physical pain I'm in, as well as the stress on my heart. Without my medications, the pain is indescribable.

I'm not sure how much longer we can continue like this.
We're not okay. At all.

We haven't even had time to process everything that we went through when we were homeless, and now if we can't come up with enough by the end of this month, we'll be homeless again. All of the progress our daughter has made will likely be lost, she'll lose her security again, and we will have no option but to live in our car this time. We simply can't afford the hotels on one income.

We will likely end up losing custody of her. We can't have a 2 year old living in a car in the extreme summer heat. It gets to over 100° here in the summer. We won't have anywhere to go for shelter and the car becomes like an oven in those temperatures.

The thought of our daughter, who is so loved, cared for, thriving, and such a happy, smart kid with a healthy attachment to both of us going into foster care just because we cant afford the $500 past due rent.. that thought is absolutely killing me. She loves us so much, and she's never spent a day away from us. One of us is always with her, we've never even had anyone babysit for us. It would break her heart if she had to go into foster care. Shes so young that we wouldn't even be able to properly explain to her what is happening.

People say ""You shouldn't have had a kid if you couldn't afford one"", but when we had her, we were doing well. This was all unexpected and we never could have anticipated losing everything in the way that we did.

We're not lazy or irresponsible people who put themselves into this situation. We're not the type to spend all of our money on things we don't need and neglect our bills. We're doing everything that we can, and will still probably lose everything.

I don't know what to do. I'm at a dead end. I've called every church in the area. I've tried to talk to our landlord to work out a different payment plan. I've talked to friends and family about the situation. I'm applying to jobs every day. We even sold everything that we could, even things we still needed like our pots and pans, food processor, and coffee pot.

Theres a part of me that wishes I could just give up, but I know I can't. I have to keep fighting for my daughter. I'm just not sure how much fight I have left in me. If we lose her, I don't know how I'll continue on. I feel like that will entirely break me, and do the same to my wife if not even worse.

If anyone has any advice, or even just any reassurance that we're not entirely failing our daughter, I would really appreciate it.

Edit:
I can no longer comment because my comments were downvoted. My wife's salary is 53,000* and each paycheck is about 1400, but it recently went down a little bit due to switching to a slightly better insurance. Health insurance for the three of us plus taxes are taken out.

* I was wrong, she makes 53,000, not 56,000. ",83,1750703554.0,toddlers,113,0.87,False

I have weighed myself every few days and just watched the scale increase. I take vyvanse 40 mg (newer medicine, switched from adderall 40 mg 2 months ago), 200 mg lamictal (7+ years), 150 Wellbutrin (7+ years), a prenatal, and cosentyx 300 mg injections (3 months). I have well managed bipolar 2 (have not any drastic symptoms in a very long time) ADHD, and HS. I formerly had a mirena IUD but got it removed last week. 

My main concern right now is how rapidly I am gaining weight, I have never gained weight this fast in my life. I have not changed anything other than starting new medication. I do not drink alcohol often, I’ve cooked the same meals I’ve always cooked, and rarely snack. Because of my adhd medication it’s easy for me to stick around 1800 calories and I do track my calories including cooking oil, condiments, etc. I don’t drink soda or coffee or sweet drinks. I go on walks or runs at least a few times a week and my lifestyle regarding exercise/being sedentary hasn’t changed. (I also have a kinesiology degree so I feel like I have a decent basic understanding of nutrition and tracking food/exercise correctly)

In the past when I’ve been “reckless” about eating out, snacking, drinking, etc. it would take me around 2 months to put on 5 pounds and then I would see the weight gain and chill out and would naturally lose it slowly back to my baseline without much effort. For the past 2 years I’ve stayed around 153-158. 

I went to my OBGYN last week to remove my iud (I had it for 4 years without issues) and asked for a full panel of bloodwork because of concerns about my hormones and wondering if my weight gain was related. Here are the results that came back so far:

Free T3: 4.1 pg/ml
Free T4: 1.26 ng/dl
Thyroid Peroxidase antibody: .3 IU/ml
TSH: 2.10 uIu/ml
Vitamin D/B12/iron in a normal range
Pregnancy test negative


Since my thyroid results look good and my lifestyle and eating hasn’t changed the only other thing I can think of is weight gain from my new medicines. I don’t think it’s vyvanse since I was on adderall for a year before that and had no weight change besides losing 5ish pounds. However I am starting to wonder if cosentyx is playing a part but I know weight gain is  not listed as a side effect. I completed my first month of loading doses without any weight gain and once I went on regular injections that’s when i noticed the change. 

I just don’t understand how I can gain so much weight in such a short amount of time. Per my obgyn’s recommendation I messaged my dermatologist on her thoughts on if cosentyx could be affecting my weight and she hasn’t responded. Is it possible for cosentyx to cause this much weight gain? I am just at a loss on why I am putting on so much weight. Please let me know your thoughts, I am desperate to find the root problem.

What I heard on the other end wasn’t comfort–it was barking. A chorus of panicked howls.

His voice was cold and distant. “I’m performing a C–section on Leanna’s dog. There are eight lives in her belly. You’ve only got two.”

Then, with a scoff, he added, “What, you can’t give birth without me? Leanna has depression. If her dog dies, she won’t survive either.“

Before I could reply, he hung up–and blocked my number.

Our son Alec, only a child, ran off to find Franco and begged him to help me. But he was in a rush, cradling a shivering dog in his arms, too busy escorting it to the pet hospital.

Without a care, he shoved Alec aside.

# My Husband Abandoned Me to Save His Childhood Friend’s Dog

I was in labor with twins–my second pregnancy–and it was a difficult birth. With the last bit of my strength, I called my husband, Franco, the so–called ‘renowned gynecologist” who should have been by my side. 

What I heard on the other end wasn’t comfort–it was barking. A chorus of panicked howls. 

His voice was cold and distant. “I’m performing a C–section on Leanna’s dog. There are eight lives in her belly. You’ve only got two.” 

Then, with a scoff, he added, “What, you can’t give birth without me? Leanna has depression. If her dog dies, she won’t survive either.“} 

Before I could reply, he hung up–and blocked my number. 

Our son Alec, only a child, ran off to find Franco and begged him to help me. But he was in a rush, cradling a shivering dog in his arms, too busy escorting it to the pet hospital. 

Without a care, he shoved Alec aside.§ 

My son stumbled, fell to the ground, and chased after him in tears–only to be struck and killed by a speeding truck. 

My unborn twins died in my womb, suffocated due to the delay in surgery. And I, from severe blood loss, was left unable to bear children ever again.! 

Losing all three of my children broke me. I wept until I could no longer breathe. 

When Franco saw the three urns and the divorce papers, he completely lost it.

After emergency surgery, I had barely been wheeled into my room when Franco barged in with Leanna clinging to him.” 

He stormed up to me, grabbed my arm, and yelled, “Mara, you’re nearly thirty. Why are you being so dramatic about giving birth? You needed me there?“> 

“Leanna’s dog nearly died! Do you have any idea how serious that was? And you–jealous and petty–made such a scene that the hospital director insisted on a C–section and forced me to come back for you?“> 

His gaze dropped to my deflated stomach. He sneered. “Didn’t you deliver naturally anyway? Don’t act so weak. I’m a doctor–I know what a natural birth looks like. With your body, you could’ve run a marathon right after. This act just disgusts me.”> 

As he pulled me, the stitches from the C–section tore open again. The pain was blinding, my body soaked in cold sweat.” 

I was deathly pale, my voice hoarse as I whispered, “The babies… they didn’t make it. It was a difficult birth…“} 

Before I could finish, Leanna burst into tears.} 

“I’m sorry, Mara, this is all my fault. Maple had complications too, and I didn’t know who else to call. I had to ask Franco. Please don’t blame him–don’t keep him from seeing his kids because of me…“} 

Franco glared at me, then gently pulled her into his arms. 

“She’s making a fuss over giving birth–what’s the big deal? It’s not even her first child. Still acting all pure like she’s never had one. I spoiled her too much.“} 

Then, as if switching masks, he turned to Leanna and softened.§ 

“Don’t listen to her. Maple gave birth to eight [ puppies](https://novel-short.com/novel/when-he-chose-her-dog-over-our-vows/chapter-01/#) on her first try. She’s the one who’s strong and amazing.“} 

Looking at them, it felt like a thousand needles stabbed straight into the softest part of my heart.” 

So this was it. In his eyes, Leanna’s dog… was more important than our children. 

“You came just to show off that the dog gave birth safely?” I choked out, my voice trembling with grief. 

Leanna wiped her tears and gently clutched my wrist. 

“No… I came to ask for your help, Mara.“} 

I yanked my hand free. “I just lost my children and nearly died. I don’t have anything left to give.“} 

“Mara!” Franco snapped. “It’s just a small favor–don’t be so heartless!” 

“You had twins. Your prolactin levels are double. Maple can’t produce milk yet. We need some to feed her puppies-“} 

I grabbed the glass from my bedside and hurled it at him. “Get out!“} 

Leanna wailed, “If Maple’s puppies die, I don’t want to live either!“} 

Suddenly, Leanna grabbed the fruit knife from the table and slashed at her wrist. 

Franco panicked, lunging to snatch it away in his haste, the blade slashed a deep gash into my thigh. 

Blood gushed out instantly, but he didn’t even notice.l 

He was too busy cradling the now fainting Leanna in his arms, whispering words of comfort, completely unaware of the wound he had just inflicted on me. 

In the chaos, the black medical case beside the bed was knocked over. It popped open slightly–just enough for a splash of bloodied water to spill outs 

Leanna shrieked and buried herself deeper into Franco’s embrace. He, in turn, kicked the box away in disgust. 

But that box held the bodies of the twins–our babies–who had died before they could even open their eyes and see the world. 

Tears poured down my cheeks. Ignoring the pain in my leg, I crawled toward the box and tried to protect it with my arms. 

But my desperate attempt only infuriated Franco. 

He kicked the box further away and coldly called for hospital staff to dispose of it. 

“No! Don’t! Pleaser 

I sobbed so hard it felt like my insides were being torn apart. I clutched the box tightly to my chest, trembling all over. 

Franco paused, then muttered with a frown, “Mara… are you having postpartum depression or something?” 

He didn’t wait for an answer. He turned and left, holding Leanna close as he walked away, leaving behind nothing but the echo of my cries in the cold hospital room.t 

\-1 

It was a long time before he rea 

This time, he brought a postpartum meal and awkwardly cleared his throat. 

1 overreacted earlier” he said. “But you shouldn’t have lied to me while I was operating on Maple.”% 

He sighed, as if the whole thing had been a minor misunderstanding. “Leanna only developed depression because she fell in love with me. I feel responsible for her. But I only see her as a sister. All those things I said–just to comfort her. You understand, right? You’re always the understanding one 

It had always been this way! 

If Leanna was unhappy, he would mess with me or Alec just to make her laugh. Then he’d bring us a small treat, a hollow apology, thinking it would make everything rightt 

I looked at the lipstick stain on the hem of his shirt and gave him a small, numb smile. 

It was over. I felt nothing but bitter emptiness.X 

However, he seemed to take that as forgiveness. 

He changed the subject, his tone light. “So? What about the babies? Were they both boys? Or two girls? Maybe one of each?” 

He waved over a nurse, beaming. “Bring them in. I want to see my kids.” 

The nurse hesitated. She glanced at me, then at him. “Dr. Davidson… your children, they…” 

Just then, his phone rang t 

Of course, it was Leanna.l 

He answered immediately. 

“Franco…” she cooed. “Maple just spit up some milk… is she going to die?” 

“Don’t be scared, Leanna, I’m coming right now” 

He hung up and rushed out of the room, so fast he forgot his coat. 

The nurse called after him indignantly, “Dr. Davidson! Your wife just had a C–section!” 

But Franco had already vanished down the hallway. 

I grabbed the nurse’s arm before she could follow.l 

“I don’t need his pity,” I said quietly. “Can you… take me to see my son?” 

Alec was waiting. On the eighteenth floor–in the morgue. 

I held my abdomen where the fresh wound throbbed with each breath and staggered toward the cold farewell room. 

There, beneath the sterile lights, lay my son. 

Alec looked so peaceful 

Tears splashed onto my hands as I pulled his tiny body into my arms. 

“My sweet, silly Alec… did it hurt? I’m sorry, Mommy didn’t protect you.“% 

“I miss you so much. You were always so obedient, so kind. How could you bear to leave me behind?“% 

“Why didn’t you take me with you? Are you scared, all alone out there?“% 

“It should’ve been me. I chose the wrong father for you. It’s all my fault.“% 

I sobbed until I couldn’t breathe. But Alec would never smile at me again. He would never hug me, never wipe away my tears with his little 

The warm, radiant little sun in my life had turned **into** a cold, pale moon. 

I didn’t know how long I sat there crying–until my tears ran dry. That’s when a notification lit up my phone screen. 

It was a public post from Leanna. 

The photo showed two people kissing tenderly, their fingers interlocked. 

The caption read. \[Congratulations, Dr. D, for passing my final test! I’ve always been your first choice, again and again. Even without a title, I’m willing to grow old with you.**\]** 

My gaze fell on the wedding ring in the photo–one I knew all too well. It stabbed into my chest like a blade. 

But none of it mattered anymore.} 

The children I loved most were gone forever.” 

‘Franco… I don’t want you anymore.” 

When I woke the next morning, a bowl of hot porridge sat on my nightstand.” 

A string of messages from Franco lit up my phone.}\] 

\[Mara, something urgent came up. I’m going on a short business trip. I left you breakfast and hired a top–tier maternity nurse and a care worker to look after you.\] 

\[By the way, the maternity ward is really short on beds. Since you had a natural birth, don’t take up the hospital bed any longer. As my family member**,** you should understand–it reflects badly on me. Please check yourself out.

\[Be good. I’ll bring back gifts for you and the babies.\]} 

**I** stared at the high–end maternity nurse standing in the doorway and felt a bitter laugh rise in my throat.” 

Sure enough, the next thing I saw on my phone was another show–off post from Leanna.} 

\[Feel better soon, my little [ pups](https://novel-short.com/novel/when-he-chose-her-dog-over-our-vows/chapter-03/#)! Daddy even took two whole days off to care for you\~ You’re so lucky to have a daddy who loves you this much!\] 

The photo was of Franco, crouching patiently as he bottle–fed a puppy. 

My nails dug deep into my palms. My heart grew heavy. 

I dismissed the nurse. 

Despite the doctor strongly advising I stay hospitalized for at least a month, I refused. 

I had a funeral to prepare–for three children. 

Three days later, I dragged my weakened body to the funeral home.} 

When I came out, I was holding three still–warm urns–the last warmth they would ever give me.” 

“Let’s go home, my babies.“} 

Back at the house, I placed the three white porcelain urns neatly on the coffee table. Beside them lay a divorce agreement.” 

The house was eerily silent. I glanced at the photo wall in a daze. 

A new picture had been added just a month ago: a family portrait taken on Alec’s seventh birthday. The three of us were smiling, frozen in time. 

Now, my tears splashed heavily onto the urns. 

I sent Franco a text. \[Let’s get a divorce.\]} 

It took him a while to reply!! 

\[Don’t be dramatic. I’m away on business. We’ll talk when I’m back.\] 

Then he sent a photo–three tiny gold lock pendants. 

\[Mara, look! Aren’t these cute? I picked them for the kids. I got one for you too. It’ll be a surprise!\]} 

The kids?? 

Coming from his mouth, that word was pure mockery.} 

All three of **our** children were dead–because of him.” 

And now he had the nerve to act like some doting father?” 

I stared closer at the gold pendants, and rage surged through me like a tidal wave. 

Those exact pendants had been on the **necks** of Leanna’s [ puppies](https://novel-short.com/novel/when-he-chose-her-dog-over-our-vows/chapter-03/#) just yesterday.” 

Eight puppies. One gold lock each. 

So even this shallow gesture of “love for the children” had been repurposed–from her dogs**?!** 

Tears blurred **my** vision. 

I took **one last** look around the house that had held **ten** years of my marriage. Then I picked up the urns**,** turned my back, and closed the door behind me without hesitation. Half an hour later**,** I parked **outside** Leanna’s apartment complex. I took one last look around the house that had held ten years of my marriage. Then I picked up the ums, turned my back, and closed the door behind me without hesitation. 

Half an hour later, I parked outside Leanna’s apartment complex. 

There they were–Franco and Leanna–pushing a stroller, walking their dogs, basking in the sunshine like the perfect couple. 

A security guard chuckled as they passed.! 

“Wow, **you** two really spoil your pets. That bottle you’re using to feed the dogs–I didn’t even buy one that expensive for my daughter. **Costs** more than a month’s salary!”

1. **Digestive Issues**: Some consumers have experienced mild digestive discomfort, such as bloating or upset stomach, particularly when first starting Java Burn. These issues often resolve as the body adjusts, but they are worth considering for those with sensitive stomachs.
2. **Price Considerations**: A frequent concern is the cost of Java Burn. While many users find the benefits justify the expense, it may be on the pricier side for some budgets, especially for consumers seeking long-term use.
3. **Variable Results**: As with any supplement, not everyone experiences the same benefits. Some users report minimal changes in weight or energy levels, leading to dissatisfaction.
4. **Dependence on Coffee**: Since Java Burn is specifically designed to be used with coffee, its effectiveness is tightly linked to regular coffee consumption. Those who do not consume coffee regularly may not find it an ideal fit.

1lio42z,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1lio42z/tifu_by_swallowing_a_150000_almond/,"TIFU by swallowing a $150,000 almond","(Note: I already told the Cliff Notes version of this story in a comment last week, but I'm bored so today I'm gonna tell the whole story.)

Obligatory not Today, but a Friday in June 2021, doldrums of Covid--not a time you wanted to be near a hospital. I was eating a lovely granola bar at my desk at work. As I unwrapped it, I noticed an especially large, glistening whole almond on the bar. I noted, ""Hmm, that's as big as my thumb."" 

Eating while typing, my mouth got distracted. Suddenly that giant almond had slipped unchewed to the back of my throat, and I thoughtlessly swallowed. I had no idea the gravity of what I had done. I mean, everybody knows that nut pieces can end up...undigested, but I had never swallowed a nut so large, not by a longshot.

I awoke Saturday morning feeling...funny. I had a very small pain just under my stomach area, but no worries yet. I proceeded to drink two big coffees and eat my cereal as normal. This was another mistake. After an hour or so, I was rocked with pain and unbelievable pressure in that spot just below my stomach. Soon I began vomiting. Rolling in pain and strain-vomiting. Then I remembered the almond.

We headed to the E/R, and when checking in I did say I thought I had an intestinal blockage, but true to form, no healthcare worker actually believed me until they reluctantly did a CT scan. My small intestine was not just blocked, it had started telescoping upon itself, which risks cutting off blood flow to the organ. I was quickly taken quite seriously and was whisked back to a surgery prep area.

The next thing I knew, I was in a room with a soft-spoken nurse who is telling me they have to place a gastric tube before my surgery. I was in no condition to really appreciate what that meant, and just then a bull of a nurse entered the room. In a hospital, it seems there's always an employee they know they can call when they *need* to really hurt a patient to help them - an employee who can hurt people without flinching. This was that nurse.

She approached me with the tube, explained they have to feed it through my nose down into my stomach to constantly suction out my stomach secretions, so my surgery site could heal without disturbance for a few days. The bull nurse drew her fist back and basically punched me with the tube square in the left nostril. My nose exploded with blood like fireworks and would not yield, so they decided that tube was too large in diameter. They had to try again with a smaller tube in the only non-destroyed nostril I had left... So she punched me again in the nose with the second tube while I was frantically guzzling water to keep my windpipe closed, and she successfully shoved the tube all the way down until it reached my stomach.

The surgery was uneventful, to me at least. They had installed a urinary catheter while I was out, which felt a little creepy to me. I mean, it was medically necessary, but it's still weird to find out someone was poking in your genitals while you're under anesthesia.

I spent the next five days in the hospital, the first three with that tube in my nose/down my throat. My surgeon would visit every day, and I had to recount every fart I had after the surgery. When I was eventually compelled to have a (watery) bowel movement, the nurses had to observe my shit, make notes, and report to the doctor all about it. Basically they needed to know my digestive system was still working and not bleeding, and the first time it was reported I had had *any* bowel movement, the surgeon whistled, ""Whew!"" ---And with that 'whew,' I suddenly realized the gravity of all that could have gone wrong with the surgery.

When they finally *slid* the tube up my throat and out of my face, I was on a liquid diet the first two days, then given a slightly more complex diet to follow for awhile at home. I was discharged after 5 days.

But it wasn't over. Two days home, I was chilling on the couch with some jello in my surgical dressing and abdominal binder, when my incision EXPLODED with about a half-pint of sticky brown liquid...scentless thank god. My clothes soaked in disgustingness, we rushed back to the hospital, and I was given IV antibiotics for the infection. And another night in the hospital for observation.

Please please chew your food, or learn to make yourself vomit if you ever happen to swallow a giant whole almond. The total price for that one almond was over $150,000 before insurance. With a hearty helping of public fart & shit analysis, and a bit of medical PTSD on the side.

(TL;DR: Swallowed a whole almond on accident, ended up with a six-figure hospital bill.)",182,1750702748.0,tifu,31,0.89,False

**The Destructive Work (OD) of Love and People**

**Sinculpa, 23/06/2025**

After watching the YouTube presentation of the book *Believing Women and Opus Dei* (by Virginia Ávila García), I found myself reflecting on a phrase the presenter used: “The Work destroys love.” And I would add: it also destroys people.

This destruction has been real. Just reading a few testimonies on that website is enough. Many of us who left did so broken by different types of suffering: physical, psychological, and spiritual. And beware… many of those who stayed are also shattered...

In other words: by breaking, manipulating, hindering development, neglecting, denying, and repressing love… people are broken. Because to love and be loved is the most basic, foundational thing; it’s what allows us to grow, to connect, etc. And, ultimately, **DEUS CARITAS EST**, God is love. True vocation and perseverance are rooted in that as well.

Here are a few —just a few— examples of what I’m talking about:

**1. Love for One’s “Blood” Family**

They taught us to:

* Lie to them while we were minors:
   * Say that annual courses or retreats were “social promotion camps” or “study days.”
   * Hide the fact that we had asked to be admitted to the Work.
* Space out visits to parents and siblings. If someone said they were going to care for a sick parent, they would ask if it was really necessary, how many hours other relatives would be there, and would apply a “mathematical formula” to tell you how many hours *you* could go.
* For a long time, we didn’t attend major family milestones: weddings (Christ went to the wedding at Cana!), anniversaries, baptisms, even wakes or funerals (Christ went to the ceremony for Lazarus!).
* Not allow family to be present at key moments in our lives within the Work: admission, oblation, fidelity. Often, they didn’t even know the ceremonies had occurred. But when it came time to buy the fidelity ring —then the parents were asked for help. It happened to me. I caused my parents a terribly painful moment when I told them they couldn’t attend my fidelity ceremony. They said: “We won’t see you get married, and we can’t witness this either? We’ve attended ordinations and perpetual vows —and you don’t share yours?”
* Think of our families as the Work’s private bank: they were asked for money, for jewelry for the tabernacles, their belongings were taken for the centers. “Holy mischief,” which wasn’t holy at all.

Let me clarify: when I was over 30 years old, I became ill from exhaustion, stress, and mistreatment. They moved me to another center. One day, my mother called (I was in another country), and the person who answered —NOT ME— told her I had been moved because I was ill. My mother immediately contacted the regional advisory to find out what was happening. Result: I got a fraternal correction from the regional director for allowing her to find out. “Those things are not to be told to parents.” Keep lying.

**2. Filial Love Among Members of the Work**

It was dangerous. It could be interpreted as a “particular friendship” or even as homosexuality. You’d see your sisters crying, distressed, shattered, but you couldn’t hug them, sit and talk, or invite them for a coffee.

But on your guard day, you slept with a book as a pillow, tightened the cilice like a tourniquet, whipped yourself with disciplines until you were marked… We are not souls from purgatory! We are flesh-and-blood people, created by God, who —like all normal human beings— need a hug, companionship, distraction! And all that… in a healthy way.

The most valued form of affection, essential to “demonstrate” good spirit, was fraternal correction. That deserves a separate article.

I won’t go into detail here about the “care” of the sick —“the treasure of the Work”— especially those with psychological or psychiatric suffering… which was often caused by that disembodied spirituality.

**3. Love of Friendship**

We were taught to do proselytism, to recruit vocations. In my region, we filled out a monthly grid listing how many people we had interacted with, how many had gone to the center, joined formation means, or were possible vocations.

When confessions were held at the university residence, a sign-up sheet was placed in the anteroom. That sheet was later kept and analyzed by the directors to see who was confessing… and to guide the “fishing.”

We were taught to observe the girls to see whether they could be “caught by the heart or by the head.” Based on that, we’d invite them to a social help camp or a cultural talk.

We were never taught to love, to accompany someone as a friend. Like Christ did with Martha, Mary (oh horror, they were women!), Lazarus, John… Friendship love that every human being needs.

Let’s not forget that Escrivá lived most of his life accompanied by Álvaro and Javi, who supported him in EVERYTHING. The founder *did* get to have very close friendships…

**4. Love for the Church**

Regarding the synodality promoted by the Pope —“the Work steps where Peter steps,” they used to say— I asked three numeraries with many years and responsibilities: none could answer. I doubt they live it.

I heard the regional vicar (of three countries) speak imprudently about Pope Francis, and lay members criticize the “sweet Christ on Earth.” They attacked Jesuits, priests who didn’t wear cassocks, nuns who lived in poor neighborhoods, pastors who didn’t allow catechesis in their parishes. They mocked diocesan priests —who cook, wash, and clean alone— for not confessing “long enough.”

Only Thomistic theology was taught. Women never participated in meetings with other Church institutions. Only priests had relationships with other priests or religious.

**5. Self-Love**

To develop self-love, you need interior freedom. But:

* They told us when we could use tampons.
* They put us on diets without asking.
* They chose our clothing.
* They demanded extremely detailed financial reports.
* They didn’t teach us to run a household (unless you were an administrator or secretary). I didn’t know the cost of rice, sugar, taxes…
* Sometimes they decided which career to pursue: “That one is not suitable, it's poorly oriented.”
* You could only watch movies or read books that were approved (chosen by a priest who had no idea what interests women).
* They told you which book to pray with, which to use for spiritual reading. Once, exhausted, I sat before the tabernacle and said: “Lord, today we will read this novel, let’s rest together.” **VADE RETRO SATANÁS!** I got a fraternal correction.
* You could never choose a schedule different from that of the center.

With these few examples, it’s clear: very little inner freedom, and therefore, self-esteem could not develop in a healthy or mature way.

I’ll stop here so I don’t bore you further.

1lio111,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1lio111/what_lies_in_shadow/,What Lies in Shadow,"CHAPTER 1: The Bodies

 Detective Milton stepped out of his battered Buick, the door groaning and creeked as he shut it behind him. The Seattle air was sharp, It was summer yet oddly enough laced with the scent of rain and distant salt from the bay. A fine mist curled through the streets, softening the neon glow of distant signs, shrouding the city in an eerie, breathless silence.

Even on a night like this, Seattle was never truly quiet. But now? It felt... wrong. As if the entire city was holding its breath, waiting. Milton pulled his coat tighter and stepped forward. The warehouse loomed ahead, a skeletal husk of rusted steel and broken glass, standing like a tomb at the edge of the docks. A dozen squad cars and unmarked vehicles clustered outside, their flashing lights casting jagged, shifting shadows. Something about the scene sent a prickle down Milton’s spine—a sensation he hadn’t felt in years, yet it felt oddly like Deja vu. Inside, the air was thick with decay and something metallic.

Forensics moved like ghosts through the gloom, cameras flashing, latex-gloved hands bagging and cataloging the unspeakable. Milton’s gut clenched as he took in the sight before him. Ten bodies. Arranged in a perfect circle. He had seen death in every form imaginable, murders of passion, gangland executions, the slow, quiet demise of addiction—but this? This was something else. This was deliberate. Ritualistic. No signs of struggle. No wounds. Just ten people lying on the cold concrete floor, their glassy eyes fixed on the rotting ceiling above.

Their expressions were not twisted in fear or agony, but disturbingly serene. Peaceful, even. “What the hell happened here?” Milton murmured. “Wish I knew,” Chief Jones said, stepping beside him. The older man’s face was hard, unreadable, but his voice carried something beneath it. Not just horror or Fear, but confusion. “You need to see this.” He handed Milton a plastic evidence bag. Inside, a small, unassuming piece of paper. A note, written in precise, almost mechanical handwriting. Find me. a strange symbol scribbles with precision in the corner of the card Milton’s pulse quickened. “There was one on each victim,” Jones said grimly. “No prints. No DNA.” A slow, creeping dread tightened in Milton’s chest. He turned, surveying the cavernous warehouse, its corners swallowed in shadow. The distant creak of metal echoed through the rafters.

Then— A whisper. Soft. Indistinct. Milton spun, his flashlight cutting through the dark. Nothing. Just empty space and the watching dead. The detective exhaled slowly. It was nothing. Just his head playing tricks on him from the tension. At least, that’s what he told himself. Milton took the card and made his way to his buick.

Back in his office, Milton sat at his desk, the city’s glow barely piercing through the rain-slicked window. The evidence bags lay before him, each holding that same chilling message. Find me. Whoever had orchestrated this had done it for a reason. They wanted to be found. But why? And why these ten victims? Hours passed as Milton dug through old case files, cross-referencing reports and news articles.

Then, buried beneath a decade of dust and bureaucracy, he found it. A case from ten years ago. Unsolved. almost The same eerie arrangement of bodies, there were 9 corpses not 10. after some more digging he found another, the files nearly torn, but still, the same, 8 bodies, arranged the same, they all had The same lack of evidence. The same message. Milton’s stomach twisted. This wasn’t a new crime. there's something deeper here, and yet when he looked at the photos, he notice something he didn't want to admit back at the warehouse, he recognized some of the bodies. yet he couldn't place from where.

The lamplight flickered, casting restless shadows across Milton’s desk as he pored over yet another stack of crime scene photos and aging case files. The air in his office was thick with the scent of stale coffee and rain-damp paper, the city’s distant hum barely audible through the rattling windowpane. His eyes burned from hours of scanning reports, but then—something stopped him cold. A photograph. It was from the original murders, taken over a decade ago. The details were as haunting as he remembered, the bodies, arranged with eerie precision—but now, something new caught his attention.

In the corner of the image, almost imperceptible, was a symbol. Faint. Overlooked. An intricate weave of lines and circles, inked onto the decayed concrete wall behind the victims. It was so faded it could have been dismissed as graffiti, but Milton knew better. His gut twisted as recognition struck. He had seen this before. The same cryptic design had been scrawled in the margins of the notes found with the new victims—notes written in the same precise, methodical hand. This was no coincidence. This was a message. no, this was a signature.

Milton grabbed his notepad and sketched the symbol, tracing every intersecting line, every deliberate stroke. with mounting urgency, he turned to his laptop. He ran searches through old case files, occult databases, and academic archives, cross-referencing everything he could find. The results were maddeningly vague. the only place he found about the symbol was on posts on old threads and blogs. mentions of forgotten sects, abandoned rituals, whispers of something ancient lurking beneath the surface of history, yet not a single thing in the database.

But, buried in an obscure academic journal, a name surfaced. Nathaniel Grant. A professor of religious anthropology. A man who had spent decades studying ancient symbols, lost sects, and the dark corners of human belief. Milton didn’t hesitate. He picked up the phone and dialed. It rang once. Twice. Then a click. A pause. A breath.

“…Who gave you this number?”

Milton’s grip on the receiver tightened.

""I'm detective Milton, I'm working along with the Seattle police department”

A long silence lasted between them""and"" his tone cold and filled with annoyance ""what's it gotta do with me""

""well, we found a symbo-""before milton could even finish his sentence Grant cut in“No.” his voice cracked and fearful. before Milton could insist The line went dead.

Milton stared at the receiver, heart pounding. Grant was scared. And that meant Milton was onto something very, very real. Milton search through records for a while and finally he found it""there you are"" Milton said to himself, a smirk forming. Milton grabbed his trench coat, he had to see grant in person.

Milton knock on Grants door, first nothing then through the door a voice called out""hello, who is it"" the voice quiet yet full of confidence""detective Milton"" A moment of quiet let out only to be broken by a sharp sigh""fine, come in"" As Milton enter he couldnt help but notice the abundance of symbols and relics adorning the shelves and walls. Milton hand dug into his pockets and showed Grant the symbol he sketched. The professor’s eyes widened in recognition, and a palpable fear washed over his face. “This,” the professor said, his voice trembling slightly, “is linked to an obscure and long-disbanded cult. They were known for their elaborate rituals” Milton pressed for more details, but Grant’s reluctance was clear. He shifted uncomfortably in his chair, his eyes darting around the room as if fearing unseen watchers. “I... I can't discuss this further,” Grant stammered. “It's too dangerous. You have no idea what you're dealing with.” “But Nathaniel, people's lives are at stake,” Milton urged, leaning forward. “I need to know everything you can tell me.” Grant's face turned pale, and he stood abruptly. “I'm sorry, Milton. I can't help you. You need to leave. Now.” Milton tried to protest, but Grant was adamant. He ushered Milton out of his house, his expression one of sheer terror. “Forget you ever saw that symbol. It’s for your own good.” As Milton stepped out into the cold night, the rain drenching his coat, he knew that this case was far from over. The cult was out there, watching, waiting, and Milton had only just scratched the surface of a much darker and deeper conspiracy.

CHAPTER 2: The Hotel

 As Milton trudged through the rain-soaked streets, his thoughts churned like the storm above. He couldn't shake the fear in Professor Grant's eyes, nor the heavy weight of the professor's warnings. But Milton knew he couldn't stop now. He was the only one who could see this through. No one else should be pulled into this, facing dangers they couldn't understand, hell even Milton could barely understand.

With resolute determination, he made his way back to his office. He unlocked the door and stepped inside, the familiar clutter offering a small comfort. He hung his drenched coat and sat at his desk, the symbol etched in his mind. This cult, whatever they were, had to be stopped, and he would do it alone if he had to. Just as he began sifting through his notes again, the phone rang, piercing the silence of the room. He picked up the receiver, the caller id was blocked yet hearing the urgent tone in the voice on the other end, it had im curious. ""Detective Milton, you need to get to the Ritz Hotel downtown, room 412."" the line closed. the abruptness of the call caught him off guard.

As Milton's mind raced with possibilities, he knew he may need backup, it could be a trap, or worse, more paperwork. He picked up his phone and dialed Chief Jones. The phone rang a few times before Jones answered, his voice gruff and slightly annoyed.

""Milton, do you know what time it is? This better be important.""

""Chief, I just got a call about something urgent at the Ritz Hotel from an unknown number. I need backup, you in?"" Milton said, his tone serious.

There was a pause on the other end, and Milton could hear Jones sigh. ""It's my day off, Milton. Can't this wait until morning?""

""I'm sorry to drag you into this, Chief, but I don't think it can. This case is getting more twisted by the minute, and I need the help. I don't want to risk anyone else getting hurt,""

Jones hesitated for a moment before replying. ""Alright, alright. Give me a few minutes to get dressed. I'll meet you there. But you better have a damn good reason for pulling me out of bed.""

""Thanks, Chief. I wouldn't ask if it wasn't important. See you soon,"" hanging up. He grabbed his coat and headed out into the rainy night, his heart pounding with anticipation. With Chief Jones by his side, he felt a bit more prepared to face whatever awaited him at the hotel. As he drove through the rain-soaked streets, the city seemed to blur around him. Shadows danced in the headlights, and he felt the weight of the unknown pressing down. But he was determined to uncover the truth, no matter how deep or twisted it was. The lives of those ten victims, and perhaps countless others, depended on it.

Milton stepped into the dimly lit apartment, the familiar scent of decay hitting his nostrils. Jones followed closely behind, his expression grim as he surveyed the chaotic scene. The walls, covered in strange runes and symbols, seemed to pulse with a malevolent energy. Trash littered the floor.

""Jesus, Milton,"" Chief Jones muttered, shaking his head. ""What the hell happened here?""

Milton glanced at his friend, his eyes narrowing. ""hell if i know, Chief. The place is a mess, and the victim…” Milton gestured toward the body lying on the ground. Jones knelt beside the torn-apart body, his face pale as he examined the gruesome remains.

“Holy Shit” Jones recoiled back “this is nothing like the last victims”

on the verge of vomiting Jones steadies himself ""No ID on him? How can we ID him?"" Milton sighed, rubbing the back of his neck in frustration. ""That's the problem, Chief. Its gonna take a while to find out. The body's so mangled, it's almost unrecognizable as human.""

Jones’s gaze wandered to the walls, his curiosity piqued by the arcane symbols. ""What's with all this?"" he asked, pointing to the runes paint in crimson. Milton frowned, standing up and dusting off his hands.

""I've seen a rune similar to some of them, apparently linked to some cult, that's all I know however so your guess is as good as mine.""

 As they continued to inspect the apartment, Milton's eyes landed on a crumpled piece of paper clutched in the victim's hand. He carefully pried it loose, unfolding the note to reveal its contents. His eyes scanned the shaky handwriting, his expression growing more serious with each word.

**To whoever finds this,**

 **I don’t know how much time I have left. But I need to tell my story. It started five years ago—a feeling, a presence. At first, just a prickle on my skin, the certainty of unseen eyes. Then, one night, I saw it.**

 **A figure stood across the street, motionless, swallowed in shadow. Its face—wrong. Too sharp, too hollow. Its eyes, vast and empty, swallowed light. I ran inside, but the feeling never left. It had noticed me. And it was waiting.**

 **The thing seeped into my life, appearing in reflections, lurking in corners just beyond sight. I tried to pretend it wasn’t real. But reality bent around it. My sleep fractured, my mind unraveled. Friends faded, school slipped away. My world shrank to the walls of my apartment, scrawled with frantic symbols, desperate warnings. None of it mattered. Then came the voice.** 

**""Sam.""**

**I turned, and there he was. My brother, Jake. Dead for years, yet standing next to me, whole and warm, just as I remembered.** 

**""It’s time to go,"" he said.**

 **For a moment, I believed. I wanted to. But something was wrong. His words stretched too long, like an echo in an empty room. His smile wavered, then cracked. His skin thinned, peeling away, revealing something else beneath. His limbs twisted, his jaw unhinged. It wasn’t Jake. It had never been Jake.**

 **Now, as I write this, I know the end is near. The thing no longer hides. It watches, patient. It knows I have nowhere left to run. If you're reading this, be careful. The shadows are not empty. And when you hear the voice of someone you love, don’t listen.**

**—Sam**

 ""Chief, you need to see this,"" Milton said, handing the note to Jones.

 Jones took the note, his eyes narrowing as he read it aloud. ""To whoever finds this, I don't know how much time I have left, but I need to tell my story...""

The note was a chilling account of fear and paranoia, and it was clear that the victim had been driven to the brink of insanity. Jones finished reading, his face etched with concern. 

""What do you make of this, Milton? You think the guy just went crazy?"" 

""Jesus, this guy..."" Milton’s voice cracked, the calm exterior he’d been holding onto finally unraveling. ""He wasn’t just paranoid. Look at the poor bastard.""

 Jones, unfazed by Milton’s outburst, calmly turned the note over, revealing another message on the back. “'Three left,'” the words on the back written in another's handwriting, he read aloud, his tone cold. He looked up, his face hardening. 

""The real question is... who’s next?"" Milton was already pacing, running over the details in his head. ""The note's a message, Chief. The symbol, the countdown—everything is calculated. But the real question is... how do we know who these next victims are?"" 

Jones nodded. ""Well, I literally just asked that,” Jones gave an annoyed look. “it's not like they're handing us any names, but there has to be something we're missing. Some patterns we can work with."" As they stood there in the cramped, dimly lit apartment, an uneasy silence lingered between them.

 Milton’s thoughts raced—until, unexpectedly, something caught his eye. On the wall across the room, partially obscured by a stack of discarded papers, there was a faint, smudged print. A photograph, curled at the edges and forgotten among the clutter. He stepped over to it, brushing aside the debris. His fingers hovered over the image as his heart sank.

It was a grainy shot, taken at night—an image of a group of people. In the dim glow of the photo, faces were barely distinguishable, but one figure stood out. Someone had drawn an X in red ink over the person’s face. And beside the X, the same symbol that had appeared on the notes from the warehouse was scrawled in a jagged hand. 

“Chief,” Milton said, his voice taut with realization. “This photo… It's one of the victims. Whoever did this marked them before they killed them. And it’s not just a random person. These people were tracked.they were being watched.”

 Jones walked over, squinting at the photo. ""You think the others in the picture are the next targets?"" Milton nodded.

 ""Could be. We need to find out who these people are. If they're still alive, we're on the clock. If they’re not, well, either way, we put them to justice.”

 Jones’s phone rang, cutting through the tension. He glanced at the screen and answered with a curt, ""Jones."" Milton watched him closely as the conversation went on. Jones' brows furrowed, and his grip on the phone tightened. He was silent for a moment, listening, his jaw ticking as the manager spoke. Then, his voice sharpened, frustration bleeding through. ""We need that footage now. What do you mean there’s a delay?"" He exhaled sharply, rubbing his temple. ""No, I don’t want to hear excuses—just get everyone down to the surveillance room.” After a short pause Milton could feel the anger radiating off of jones. “I don’t care if it’s a damn weekend, make it happen."" Jones hung up with a sharp exhale, his jaw tight as he met Milton’s gaze. 

""That was the hotel manager. They’ve finally pulled the footage from the night of the murder.” Jones’s voice filled with excitement, but also more than a hint tension. 

“There’s something on there. We’re about to find out exactly who we’re dealing with.""

 Milton’s heart raced. “Let’s go. We’ve got no time to waste.”

Chapter 3: Lurking

Inside the surveillance room, the manager played the footage. Milton and Jones watched intently as a hooded figure entered room 412. The figure moved with purpose, leaving behind a small object before exiting.

""There,"" Milton pointed. ""What's that?""

The manager zoomed in on the object—a charm with the same symbol found on the notes and the photograph. Milton's eyes narrowed. ""That's our link. We need to find out where these charms are coming from.""

Leaving the hotel, Milton noticed a man loitering near the entrance. He wore a hood similar to the one in the footage, and his eyes shifted nervously. Milton's instincts sharpened. ""Jones, over there. That guy. He looks suspicious.""Jones nodded, and they approached the man, who immediately started to flee. ""Stop! Police!"" Jones shouted, but the man bolted down an alleyway. Milton and Jones gave chase, the narrow, darkened alley echoing with their footsteps.

The man led them through a maze of dingy backstreets, the air thick with the scent of decay and desperation. Finally, they cornered him in a dead-end alley. ""Hold it right there!"" Milton commanded, his gun drawn.

The man, panting and wide-eyed, raised his hands. ""Don't shoot! I... I can help you.""

Milton and Jones exchanged a glance. ""Start talking,"" Milton demanded.

The man, visibly trembling, revealed he was a low-ranking member of the cult. ""They have a hideout in Tacoma,"" he stammered. ""It's in an old, abandoned building covered in graffiti. You can't miss it. The place is falling apart, with broken windows and rusted metal doors barely hanging on their hinges.""

Milton's eyes narrowed, urging the man to continue. ""What's inside?"" he demanded.

""It's where they meet and plan the rituals,"" the man explained, his voice quivering. ""The walls are covered in strange symbols, and there's always a faint smell of incense and decay. In the back, there's a large room with a makeshift altar, where they conduct their ceremonies. They use candles and chants, and sometimes... sacrifices."" His voice faltered as he spoke the last word, his eyes wide with fear.

Milton exchanged a glance with Jones, both understanding the gravity of the situation. ""Take us there,"" Milton ordered.

The man led them through the dimly lit streets of Tacoma, weaving through narrow alleyways and past abandoned buildings. The further they went, the more decrepit the surroundings became. Graffiti-covered walls and shattered glass littered the ground, a stark contrast to the bustling city center.

Finally, they arrived at a dilapidated warehouse, its exterior covered in vibrant, chaotic graffiti. The building seemed to pulse with a sinister energy, the dark windows like empty eye sockets staring back at them. Milton could feel the malevolence emanating from the place.

""Stay alert,"" he whispered to Jones, as they approached the entrance. The rusted metal door creaked loudly as they pushed it open, revealing a dimly lit interior.

Inside, the warehouse was a maze of shadows and flickering candlelight. Strange symbols adorned the walls, and the air was thick with the scent of burning incense and something far more foul. Voices echoed from deeper within, a low, rhythmic chanting that sent chills down their spines.

Milton signaled for the man to stay quiet as they crept closer. They peered into a large chamber at the back of the warehouse, where several cult members were gathered, chanting in unison. The makeshift altar was adorned with candles and mysterious artifacts, casting eerie shadows on the walls.

Milton's blood ran cold as he recognized some of the faces from the photograph. These were the targets, the next victims of the cult's sinister plan.

Jones whispered, ""We need backup.""

Milton shook his head. ""No time. We need to act now.""

With a silent nod, they moved closer, their senses on high alert. Milton counted the cult members—six in total. They would need to be quick and precise.

Here’s a more intense and gripping version of your scene:

Milton burst into the chamber, gun raised. ""Seattle PD! Hands in the air—now!""

The air crackled with tension. The hooded cultists froze mid-chant, their ritual abruptly cut short. A heartbeat later, chaos erupted. Some lunged for weapons, others bolted for the exits. Shadows flickered across the candlelit walls as the room descended into a frenzy.

Jones moved in behind Milton, covering his flank. ""We've got movement!"" he barked.

A robed figure lunged at Milton, dagger flashing. He barely had time to react—twisting just enough for the blade to miss his ribs by inches. In one swift motion, he wrenched the knife from his attacker's grip and sent him sprawling to the floor with a vicious strike. Another cultist sprang at Jones, but she was met with a brutal takedown, her wrists snapped into cuffs before she could fight back.

""Get them out!"" Milton shouted, jerking his head toward the terrified victims bound near the altar.

Jones hustled the captives toward the exit, but Milton's attention locked onto the man standing before the altar—the cult leader. A towering figure with piercing eyes and a sinister smirk, he seemed unfazed by the police's arrival.

""You’re too late,"" the man rasped.

Milton aimed his gun at the leader’s chest. ""Yeah? I don’t see any hellspawn running around. Ritual’s over.""

The cultist chuckled—a deep, unsettling sound. ""The ritual isn’t over, detective. It’s only the beginning.""

A low hum vibrated through the chamber. The symbols on the altar pulsed with an eerie crimson light. The air thickened, crackling with unseen energy. Then, with a sudden, deafening crack, the ground split open.

A swirling vortex of shadow and fire tore through the center of the altar. The temperature plummeted, and a force unlike anything Milton had ever felt clawed at his skin, pulling him toward the rift.

Milton’s breath hitched. ""What the hell—?""

The leader grinned through bloodied teeth. ""The doorway has been opened."" His voice was almost reverent. ""You stopped us tonight, but you have no idea what you've just set free.""

The portal expanded, its tendrils of darkness reaching outward, hungry and alive.

And then, something inside it moved.

Milton's heart raced as he faced the portal. The swirling chaos within it seemed to beckon him, whispering ancient, unintelligible words that tugged at the edges of his mind. He took a cautious step forward, feeling the pull of the unknown.

""Milton, don't!"" Jones shouted, grabbing his arm. ""We need to secure the area and get out of here. This is way beyond us.""

Milton hesitated, torn between the urge to explore the unknown and the need to protect those around him. He nodded, stepping back. ""You're right. Let's get everyone out of here and figure out what we're dealing with.""

As they turned to leave, a grotesque, disfigured hand shot out of the swirling void. Its flesh was a sickly gray, stretched tight over jagged bones, with clawed fingers that oozed a thick, black ichor. The air reeked of rot and sulfur as the thing latched onto Milton’s wrist with an iron grip, its touch ice-cold and burning all at once.

Milton barely had time to react. His muscles tensed as he tried to yank free, but the strength of the thing was monstrous. His breath hitched as an overwhelming force wrenched him forward—his boots scraping helplessly against the stone floor.

“Jones—!” His shout was cut off as the vortex swallowed him whole.

The last thing he saw before vanishing was Jones’ face—shock turning to raw determination.

""Milton!"" Jones roared.

Without a second thought, he lunged forward, arms outstretched, and dove into the churning abyss after his partner.

The portal slammed shut behind them with a thunderous boom, leaving only the flickering candlelight and the stunned, silent cultists in its wake.

Chapter 4: The search for Milton

Jones felt his body wrenched in every direction at once, as if he were being unraveled and reassembled at an impossible speed. A deafening rush filled his ears—a cacophony of whispers, screams, and something else, something ancient and hungry. His vision blurred into a smear of shifting shadows and cold fire before he was suddenly spat out into a world that was utterly, terrifyingly wrong.

He hit the ground hard, the impact jarring his bones. The air was thick and heavy, pressing down on him like an unseen weight. As he pushed himself up, his breath came in ragged gasps, fogging in the frigid air.

The world around him was a twisted reflection of the city he knew. The skyline was still there, but warped—buildings loomed at odd angles, their glass facades cracked like splintered mirrors. The streets were eerily empty, abandoned cars rusting in place, their windows shattered. Vines—thick, gnarled, and pulsing with an unnatural glow—coiled around traffic lights and strangled street signs, reclaiming the lifeless urban sprawl.

Above, the sky was an abyss. No stars. No moon. Just an endless, swirling blackness, shifting like oil on water.

Jones swallowed hard, his pulse pounding.

""Milton!"" he called, his voice cutting through the silence like a gunshot. It echoed unnaturally, repeating back at him in distorted fragments.

No response.

A cold dread settled in his gut. He was alone. Separated. And something told him this place was watching him.

He took a cautious step forward, his boots crunching on brittle asphalt. Every instinct screamed at him to move carefully—this place was not just abandoned. It was forsaken.

The battle against the cult was far from over. The real fight—the one they never saw coming—was just beginning. And if he didn’t find Milton soon, he might not find him at all.

""Milton!"" Jones shouted again, his voice cutting through the suffocating silence. Determination fought against the gnawing fear creeping up his spine. Every step forward felt like it dragged him deeper into a waking nightmare.

His flashlight flickered violently, struggling against the oppressive darkness. The long shadows it cast seemed to move on their own, twisting and contorting across the crumbling buildings.

Jones gritted his teeth and tightened his grip on his gun. It was his only tether to reality, his only source of control in this wrong world.

Then, he turned a corner and froze.

An old playground stood before him, its skeletal frame half-swallowed by creeping decay. The rusted swings creaked in the nonexistent wind, their rhythmic groans sending chills down his spine. A carousel stood still, its paint peeling, its figures twisted into grotesque grins.

And in the center of it all, a figure hunched over.

Jones’ heart slammed against his ribs. Milton?

He stepped forward, breath shallow, the weight of unseen eyes pressing down on him. ""Milton?"" he called cautiously.

The figure stirred.

Jones took another step, raising his flashlight—

The light hit the thing’s face.

His stomach lurched. It wasn’t Milton.

The figure turned, revealing a grotesque, disfigured visage—skin stretched too tight over jagged bone, its mouth twisted open in a permanent, silent scream. Hollow, soulless eyes locked onto him. A sound like cracking bones filled the air as its body jerked unnaturally.

Jones stumbled back, his breath catching in his throat.

Then the thing moved.

It let out a shrill, bloodcurdling wail that rattled through the abandoned streets, piercing the unnatural silence like a blade. The sound burrowed into Jones’ skull, setting his nerves on fire. His hand shot up instinctively, gun raised—

But before he could fire, the thing collapsed into the shadows, dissolving into the darkness as if it had never been there.

Only the echo of its scream remained.

Jones exhaled sharply, trying to steady his pulse. Get a grip. This place was trying to break him, to worm its way into his mind. He couldn’t let it go.

He pushed forward, navigating the desolate streets. The horrors of this world unfolded around him—an overturned bus, its windows shattered like screaming mouths; a library, its shelves collapsed, books rotting in damp piles; a clock tower looming in the distance, its face frozen at midnight. Time itself felt abandoned here.

Then—

A sound.

Faint, but unmistakable.

A desperate, ragged cry for help. Jones’s pulse spiked. He turned toward the sound, boots crunching on fractured pavement. Milton.

The cries led him to a crumbling church, its once-grand doors hanging off rusted hinges. Shattered stained glass littered the entrance like broken dreams. He pushed inside, the scent of mildew and something foul invading his nostrils.

The pews were overturned, the altar desecrated with dark, swirling symbols that seemed to pulse when he looked at them too long. And there, sprawled on the cold stone floor—

Milton.

Jones rushed forward, dropping to his knees beside him. ""Milton! Can you hear me?""

Milton's eyes flickered open. They were wide, haunted. His skin was pallid, and his breath came in shallow gasps. ""Jones..."" he rasped. ""The portal... it took me. I saw things, Jones. Horrible things."" His voice barely rose above a whisper. ""We have to get out of here.""

Jones nodded, hauling him up. ""Come on, partner. We're leaving.""

But as they turned toward the exit—

The ground shook.

A deep, guttural growl rumbled through the church, rattling the walls. The air turned frigid. Jones spun around, dread clawing at his chest.

From the shadows, something stepped forward.

It was tall—impossibly tall—its gaunt frame stretched beyond natural proportions. Its limbs were long, bony, and ended in clawed fingers that twitched as though hungry. Its skin, translucent and slick, revealed veins pulsing with a sickly glow beneath the surface. Its mouth—jagged, unnatural, filled with serrated teeth—curved into something that might have been a smile.

Its eyes burned. Not with fire, but with a deep, malevolent hunger.

The thing exhaled, a sound like dry leaves scraping over a corpse.

Jones didn’t hesitate.

""RUN!"" Milton cried out

He yanked Milton forward, bolting through the doors as the creature let out an ear-splitting shriek. The ground trembled beneath them as they sprinted through the desolate streets, their ragged breaths lost in the howling wind.

Every corner they turned, the creature was there—watching, waiting, closing in. It didn’t run. It didn’t need to. The city itself felt like it was conspiring against them, twisting, shifting, trapping them in an ever-tightening maze of horror.

The whispers followed them. Low, insidious murmurs slithering into their ears, promising things too terrible to comprehend.

Desperate, Jones spotted an old, abandoned theater. He dragged Milton inside, shoving past the dust-covered seats, ducking behind the rotting stage curtains.

They pressed themselves into the shadows, struggling to catch their breath.

The creature’s growls reverberated through the empty space. It was here. Hunting.

Milton gripped Jones' arm. ""Jones... what if there's no way out?""

Jones clenched his jaw, forcing down the fear threatening to consume him. ""There’s always a way out.""

The creature’s footsteps echoed across the theater floor. Slow. Deliberate.

Jones tightened his grip on his gun, his pulse hammering in his ears.

""Jones, what are we going to do?"" Milton whispered, his voice barely audible over the pounding of his own heart.

Jones stared into the darkness, listening to the creature’s slow, deliberate movements beyond the stage. It was waiting. Hunting. Their time was running out.

His mind raced. There was no way they’d outrun it. No way they’d both make it.

Taking a slow, steady breath, Jones clenched his jaw. He already knew what had to be done.

""Stay here, Milton."" His voice was calm, resolved. ""I'll draw it away.""

Milton’s eyes widened. ""No, you can’t""

Jones placed a firm hand on his shoulder. ""Just trust me.""

Before Milton could protest, Jones stood and stepped out from behind the stage. His flashlight beam cut through the dust-choked air as he yelled ""HEY! OVER HERE!""

The creature reacted instantly.

A sound like splintering bone and tearing sinew filled the theater as it lunged forward.

Milton barely caught a glimpse of it—twisted limbs snapping unnaturally, glowing eyes locked onto Jones like a predator sighting its prey.

Jones ran.

Milton could hear the frantic pounding of his boots against the wooden floor, the sickening scrape of the creature giving chase.

The theater exploded into chaos—crash! Rows of seats shattered like brittle bones as the thing tore through them. Bang! Bang! Jones fired twice, but the bullets might as well have been spitballs.

Milton’s breath came in short, panicked bursts. He clutched his gun so tightly his fingers ached. He wanted to move, to help, but his body wouldn’t listen.

Jones grunted, followed by a wet sound—something slicing into flesh.

Then—a scream.

Milton had never heard Jones scream before. It wasn’t just pain. It was pure agony.

A horrific ripping sound filled the air, followed by a grotesque, gurgling choke. And then... silence.

Thick, suffocating silence.

Milton’s entire body went cold.

""Jones?"" His voice was barely a whisper.

Nothing.

Then—drip.

A slow, rhythmic dripping from somewhere beyond the wreckage.

Milton forced himself forward, legs shaking beneath him. His flashlight quivered in his grip, the beam flickering over the destruction. Splintered wood. Blood splattered across the stage. Deep claw marks gouged into the walls.

And then—

His light landed on something crumpled against the aisle.

His stomach twisted.

Jones lay sprawled across the shattered remains of a seat, his body ruined.

His left arm was gone, torn away just below the shoulder, the flesh jagged and uneven, glistening in the dim light. His uniform was soaked in blood, deep gouges carved across his chest, exposing raw muscle beneath. His neck—God, his neck—had been ripped open, his windpipe visible, the torn flesh around it dark and wet.

But somehow... somehow, he was still breathing.

Milton fell to his knees beside him. ""Jones!"" His voice cracked. Oh, God, no.

Jones' eyes fluttered open, unfocused, hazy with pain. His lips trembled, stained red.

Then, weakly, he reached into his pocket.

With trembling fingers, he pulled out something—an old, worn photograph, now streaked with blood.

His wife. His kids. Smiling faces frozen in time.

He pressed it into Milton’s hand, his fingers slick and sticky with his own blood. His lips moved, the effort costing him what little strength he had left.

""Make sure my family's okay, Milton.""

Then his body sagged.

The last breath rattled from his lungs.

Milton could only stare. His hands shook violently, gripping the photo so hard it crumpled in his palm. His mind screamed at him to do something—anything—but it was too late.

A slow, wet dragging sound echoed through the theater.

Milton lifted his gaze.

The creature stood in the wreckage, its glowing eyes fixed on him. Blood dripped from its claws. From its mouth.

From Jones.

Milton’s breath hitched.

Then it took a step forward.

And Milton ran.
