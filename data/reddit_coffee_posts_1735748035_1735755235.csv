First one was Claire Saffitz's carrot cake, which came out great. This was a chocolate cake from Sugar Spun Run (ingredients list in second photo).

It doesn't sound like a problem, but I feel like the whole thing won't keep long and eats kind of wet? When I did the carrot cake, the layers of buttercream were defined/clean. This time, I did a ring of peanut butter frosting around the edges and then about a half cup of raspberry compote filling per layer in the center which I thought was enough, but you can't even see the layers when it's cut open. It was a thick compote, too. It seems like the cake soaked it all up and so formed a kind of mushy melded center.

1hr8e1o,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1hr8e1o/how_to_sit_down_and_study_for_hours/,How to sit down and study for hours,"Studying is a refined skill that takes time to cultivate, I want to explore with you the common obstacles that people face and what you can do about them.

# If It’s hard to digest:

One of the following reasons may behind why it’s hard for you to go through the material:

**It’s not well explained**:

Look for other sources for the topic you’re trying to learn. There are countless videos, free courses, and AI tools that can provide alternative explanations, which might make a concept click for you.

I studied engineering in the past, and some online videos taught the material better than some of my teachers, now ChatGPT can do it even better.

**You skipped the basics**:

If it feels like they’re speaking another language or you consistently go back and review previous definitions, concepts, rules, etc then you need to properly review the basics. You might think you’re saving time by skimming over things, but your brain needs a solid jumping-off point to connect the dots. Without that foundation, the material will feel like it’s slipping though your fingers.

Yes, I know, who wants to review the basics for the second, third, or fourth time, right?

**Lack of focus:**

Even the simplest concepts can be hard to understand if you’re not focused and present. You may think you’re focused, but it wouldn’t hurt to check.

How often do you get interrupted, and by what? If you can’t go a single hour without being interrupted, you need to address the cause of the disruption, try to minimize or get rid of noise, get your phone in another room.

Not being exposed to the stimulus is much easier than being exposed and resisting the impulse to give in.

You weren’t thinking about a pink elephant before reading this sentence but now try not to think about it.

# If it’s unpleasant:

Studying can sometimes feel like a lose-lose situation, you need to study for hours every day, ignore all the good and fun things around you, and barely make a dent in your grades, or you can simply play video games for 4 hours and it won’t affect your grade that much.

This is where discipline comes in. Discipline isn’t about finding some inner motivation to propel you through the pain. Let’s be honest, you probably won’t feel that motivated until the night before the test.

What you can do today is willingly expose yourself to a counterintuitive, unpleasant, unrewarding activity at small scale.

Even 10-15 minutes will do.

The only condition is to do it at least three times a week. Yes, it will feel like a lose-lose situation. The good news is you *can* do it, and your tolerance will improve over time.

# If you’re tired

Let’s go over the basics that we consistently ignore:

If you spend most of your time staring at a screen, your eyes will feel tired and strained. If you do it too much, you might feel sleepy and fatigued; Let your eyes rest by taking a nap or looking at something in the distance for 10-20 minutes.

If you feel like you lack energy, go through this checklist:

* Did you drink any water in the last hour (not coffee, tea, or an energy drink)?
* Did you have a meal (not a snack) in the last three hours?
* Do you feel sleepy? Do you need to take a nap?
* Do you take basic vitamins to cover common deficiencies (Vitamin D, B12, A, E, C, Magnesium, Zinc, Iron,)? Did you take them today?
* Did you move at all in the last hour? Did you walk for at least five minutes in the last three hours?

# If you feel defeated or conflicted

**Catching up:**

Motivation and resilience are heavily dependent on framing. How you view failure and effort can either work for you or against you.

If you’re trying to catch up because you slacked off, you may want to compensate by studying hard for the next couple of days, right?

But let’s step back for a moment, how realistic is that? The difficult decision here is to let go of the dream for the perfect grade and start from where you are.

This is a lesson best learned early.

**Conflict:**

If you’re conflicted about your major or a specific class, or if you flunked a test and think it’s unfair that you have to study for it, maybe you’re jealous of how easily others get things done, and it feels unfair.

All these thoughts generate emotions, and those emotions influence your actions. Some will push you forward; others will hold you back.

Ask yourself:

* How do you view the situation you’re in?
* How do you feel about it?
* Does this help you study more or less? Why?
* How can you update your framing to become more motivated?

# If you don’t know how to study

Most of us learn in different ways, both directly and indirectly, through friends, parents, teachers, and so on.

People usually don’t stop to consider their own learning and studying process until it is either too late or when it gets too serious, with a direct impact on their life’s trajectory.

I want you to take a moment and ask yourself: **Have you learned or studied how to learn?**

There are excellent free courses out there that can teach you how to learn and study effectively. One that was popular back when I was in university was *Learning How to Learn* by Dr. Barbara Oakley.",1,1735754593.0,getdisciplined,0,1.0,False

Rows of young, curious faces stared back at him, their wide eyes reflecting both wonder and boredom. The lesson wasn’t part of the standard curriculum—it was Ace’s personal indulgence.

“Ten thousand years ago,” Ace began, pacing in front of the chalkboard, “a war unlike any other raged across realms. Heaven and Hell clashed in what came to be known as The Eternal War. Thor, Apollo, and Neptune led the forces of Heaven, while Lucifer, Hades, and Loki commanded the armies of Hell.”

A hand shot up. “Mr. Lockhart, is this real history?”

Ace smiled. “That’s the mystery, isn’t it? There’s no proof, only stories passed down through the ages. But imagine it—a war so massive it lasted five thousand years.”

The bell rang, cutting him off. The children erupted into chatter, grabbing their bags and heading for the door. Ace watched them leave, his mind lingering on the ancient war. It had fascinated him since he first read about it in an old, tattered book he’d found in a secondhand store.

Later that evening, Ace sat in his small apartment, a plate of reheated spaghetti growing cold on the coffee table. The news droned on in the background, the anchor’s voice a monotone accompaniment to his thoughts.

“And now, breaking news,” the anchor announced, her tone shifting to urgency. “A shocking video has surfaced, showing three unidentified individuals wreaking havoc in downtown Tokyo. Authorities are baffled, as the individuals appear to exhibit... supernatural abilities.”

Ace froze, his fork halfway to his mouth. The screen switched to shaky footage of three figures—one wielding a golden trident, another glowing with radiant light, and the last summoning lightning with a swing of his hammer.

“No way...” Ace whispered, his chest tightening. “Thor, Apollo, Neptune?”

The footage cut to chaos: buildings crumbling, people screaming, and the gods of Heaven unleashing destruction. Ace’s fascination turned to dread. This wasn’t a story—it was real.

A sudden crash outside jolted him from his thoughts. He rushed to the window and saw people running, their faces pale with terror. The gods were here.

Panic surged through him as he grabbed his coat and bolted for the door. The streets were a cacophony of screams and sirens. He barely made it a block before he came face to face with a figure bathed in golden light.

Apollo.

The god’s eyes burned with divine fury as he raised a hand, a ball of fire forming in his palm. “You dare to exist in the presence of the divine?” Apollo’s voice was a thunderclap.

Ace stumbled back, his mind screaming for him to run, but his legs refused to move. The fireball hurtled toward him, and in that split second, something within him stirred.

A shadowy force enveloped him, and the world around him dissolved into darkness. When the light returned, he found himself in an unfamiliar place—a cavern illuminated by a faint, crimson glow.

“Welcome, Ace Lockhart,” a deep, resonant voice echoed.

Ace turned, his breath catching as he saw a figure emerge from the shadows. A man with piercing eyes and an aura of power.

“Lucifer?”

The figure smirked. “You’ve been chosen, mortal. The gods of Heaven have betrayed their purpose. If you wish to survive—and save your world—you’ll need my power.”

**Disclosure:** Amanda is not aware that I am doing this review

**Seller:** Amanda (her info is on the seller’s list; find it there!)

**Factory:** XM Factory

**Price Paid for Item:** 3000CNY + 480CNY = 3480CNY = $476.85 USD

**Timeline:**

* 12/5 – Inquired about the bag
* 12/5 – She confirmed bag was available and paid
* 12/8 – She sent me the PSP and I green-lighted
* 12/9 – Amanda shipped the package
* 12/16 – Package arrived!

**Measurements:**

* DIMENSIONS: 30.5 cm (W) × 20.3 cm (H) × 8.9 cm (D), strap drop: 58.4 cm (single), 33 cm (doubled).

**My Thoughts:** Let me start by admitting something: I’ve never been a Chanel girl. Nope, not me. Growing up, my mom was (and still is) a designer-obsessed queen with a treasure trove of authentic Chanels, but even with all that Chanel energy around me, I never felt the urge to borrow one. Too bougie, too fancy, too not me.

But, as the years went by, something changed. Maybe I’ve been repfluenced (thanks, repladies!) by all those posts showing off Chanel Classic Flaps. Or maybe my tastes just matured (ha!). Whatever the reason, I fell hard into the Chanel rabbit hole—researching every detail about the Classic Flap lineup like I was prepping for a PhD in designer bags with concentration on Chanel Classic Flaps. LOL!

My first adventure was with a CF Small from Amanda from the God Factory. Spoiler: it wasn’t love. Womp, womp! That bag fit my 8-year-old daughter better than me! It was cute, but I’m a mom who needs a bag that can haul a bit more than vibes. So, I took the plunge and upgraded to the Jumbo. And let me tell ya, chef’s kiss!!

Now, let’s talk details because this bag deserves the hype. First, the caviar leather is absolutely stunning. I’ve compared it side-by-side with my mom’s authentics, and honestly? It comes pretty damn close. The grain is just right! It’s durable, luxurious, and that perfect mix of soft yet structured. The hardware is equally impressive. The silver has weight to it, giving off that premium feel you expect from a Chanel, and the chain straps? Pure perfection. They’re sleek, shiny, and don’t squeak (a personal pet peeve of mine). The straps have that gorgeous, authentic-looking silver shine that screams understated elegance.

And oh boy, this bag is a packing dream. It holds my LV mini pochette, iPhone 16 Pro Max, iPhone 14 pro, my portable Anker charger, Touchland sanitizer, wet wipes, AirPods, hand cream, Kleenex and still has room for a “just in case” snack stash. It’s like a Mary Poppins bag with better stitching.

The cherry on top? It’s surprisingly versatile. It’s fancy enough to turn heads but practical enough for mom life, plus it works as a crossbody and suits my frame perfectly. The only downside? It’s a bit of a workout once you load it up. But hey, who needs a gym when you’ve got a Chanel?

So here I am, a convert with a newfound love and appreciation for the Chanel Classic Double Flap. Never say never, right?

**Thoughts on the factory:** Honestly, I originally planned to order this bag from the God Factory because my small Classic Flap was from there, and my friend who owns a ton of Chanel rave about GF or this specific bag. But then Amanda swooped in and told me about an even better version from the XM Factory. She swears by it, claiming the leather is more accurate and just better overall. And because I trust Amanda like my morning coffee (essential and never wrong), I went with her suggestion.

When the bag arrived, the first thing I noticed was the leather—it smelled absolutely delicious. Like walking into a leather shop! The caviar? Oh, it’s a dream. It’s smoother than the God Factory version but still textured like it should be, and the leather feels soft yet durable. Basically, it’s everything I didn’t know I needed. Trusting Amanda paid off big time. XM Factory for the win!

**Thoughts on the seller:** This is my millionth purchase from Amanda (okay, fine, maybe more like my thousandth, but who’s counting?). Honestly, there’s not much left to say about her because she’s an absolute OG and hands-down the best of the best in this game, in my opinion. If you know, you know!

Those lucky enough to shop with her absolutely adore her. For those who haven’t? Well, they might feel a little meh about her since she can be, let’s say, a bit ghostly at times. She’s the kind of seller that requires patience—a lot of it—but trust me, the moment you finally get your bag, it’ll all be worth it. Disappointment? Not on her watch!

**Take Away:** I never thought I’d be a Chanel girl, but here I am, fully converted and obsessed with my Jumbo Classic Flap. The caviar leather? Stunning. The hardware? Chef’s kiss. The space? Mary Poppins-level. It’s the perfect mix of bougie and practical for mom life, with just one minor con—it’s a little heavy, but hey, who needs a gym?

1hr89tg,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1hr89tg/my_27m_gf_30f_refuses_to_talk_when_we_are_having/,My (27M) gf (30F) refuses to talk when we are having a disagreement or fight and blames me for not trying to fix it.  Am I in the one to blame?,"We have been together for 6 months and living together for 4 months. Every time we get into an argument she storms into another room and slams the doors on the way.  When I go to try and talk about it, she refuses to talk and ignores me.  I end up going in another room to let her cool off so we can have a conversation about the problem and figure out a solution rationally rather than yelling or screaming.  After I leave her alone for a few minutes she usually comes out stares at me still upset and I ask ""do you want to talk about this now?"" which she then storms back into the room, in my opinion expecting me to chase after her.  I do not like playing this cat and mouse game, I think it's very childish as we are both adults.  I understand being angry and needing time to cool off but then blaming me for not coming to try and resolve the issue is not right in my opinion.

  
Our recent fight was this:

I came home from work, physically active job in which I am constantly moving for 7-8 hours a day.  Also, I do intense workouts in the morning before work, so when I get home, I am usually exhausted and need a few minutes to sit down and relax.

Yesterday I came home from work, and she was finishing up cooking dinner, which she said would be another 45 minutes or so.  I sit down and turn on a show, she comes over and asks if I want to do anything like play cards or watch a movie while we wait for dinner to finish.  I say maybe later but I want to relax until after dinner.  So, we get to dinner and after dinner my show has maybe 20 minutes left so I wanted to just finish it before we do anything, she does her own thing. Once it is done, we end up get frisky and after I walk out to finish cleaning up the house and get ready to do some yoga which we do every night.  I picked one video to follow and this is when she came out upset with me.

She says ""ever since you got home it has been all about you and what you want to do."" Which is true but at this moment it is only 7pm and I have only been home for maybe 2-3 hours with plenty of night still left. I disagreed and said we can do stuff together now and I am sorry I needed some time to relax after work.  She gets mad and storms into the bedroom slamming the door.  I follow and try and figure this out and she ignores me. I then go back to stretch and give her time to cool off, she then comes out and is still mad and goes ""see you are doing what you want, it is all about you, I wanted to do yoga with you but you didn't wait for me.""

I say ""alright I am sorry I can start over and we can do it together if you come out here."" which she storms off again.  Now this is where I am not playing the cat and mouse game, so I go back to stretching.  I then go and try and talk to her but she continues to yell at me saying it is all about me and what I want to do.  I then try and explain my side and how I just needed a second to relax.  She storms into another room again.  I sit down to read, she then comes out looks at me without saying anything then goes back into the bedroom and locks the door.  I then try and get up and tell her to open the door so we can talk about this.  

We end up just agreeing to go to bed and I figure we will sleep it off and talk about it in the morning.  This morning comes I get up first and go workout, eat, make us coffee and then do post workout stretching. She gets up and storms around the house without saying any words and gets ready and leaves the house.

  
I am sitting here trying to understand if I am wrong so I can fix it and be better.  I am all about communication and figuring out the solution so we can move on and not make the same mistake. 

  
TLDR:  Gf and I got into and argument after dinner saying I only want to do what I want.  Tried talking about it and figuring out the problem and understanding each other's perspective so we can come to and understanding.  She storms out and ignores me when trying to talk about the issue.  Ends up leaving the house without talking.

I became good friends with someone I met at a part-time job I had when I was 18 years old. We got on really well and I soon became close to her family too.  
Knowing that I didn't have a good relationship with my own mom, her mother started making comments about how I was ""her daughter now"" and she had ""adopted"" me.

I started being invited to some family events - like when they wanted help setting up for a party or when they needed extra people to make up numbers at a weekend city break.  
At these events, it was constantly reiterated to me that I was ""family.""  
But on other events like Thanksgiving or Christmas, I was told ""sorry, family only!"" and I didn't hear from them at all during Covid-19.

Once the lockdowns ended, I was guilt-tripped for not coming over to ""see my family"" but when I'd try to make plans to visit, they'd tell me something like ""oh sorry, we're doing a family dinner on Saturday! How about you come over for a coffee on Sunday instead?""

It was very mixed messages, but I always thought they meant well so I tried not to be offended that I was only ""family"" about 50% of the time.

However, another issue presented itself when I needed a lift somewhere in a literal life-or-death emergency.  
I wouldn't have asked unless it was extremely urgent and so one of them drove me where I needed to go.

Afterwards, they asked me for €60 to cover the costs of them ""helping"" me.  
The journey there and back would have been barely €20 in gas/petrol money so I have no idea where the figure of 60 came from.  
But I paid it, because I didn't know what else to do.

About a year later, one of them offered to help me with a DIY job in my house.  
Some of you may already see where this is going but I was naïve and I think a part of me still wanted to feel like they were my family.  
""Are you sure?"" I said.  
""Of course, we're family!"" they replied.  
After they gave me a hand with the job, they said ""OK - let's say...€40 for helping you?""  
Let it be known they paid for none of the supplies and only did a small part of the work.

I paid it and didn't really talk to anyone in the family again after that.  
Since then, one of the brothers has contacted me a few times trying to sell me tools from his mechanic's garage that he's getting rid of (what?) but none of them seem to notice that I essentially fazed them out.

I've since found out they've ""adopted"" a different friend of their children's who they're now calling ""family"" instead.

So that's my story.

Some people will do this to make themselves feel charitable or like they're doing something really generous.  
But you deserve a full-time family; not someone who'll only claim you as family half of the time and charge you money for favours.

1hr888u,https://www.reddit.com/r/FlairEspresso/comments/1hr888u/flair_58_issues_cant_keep_high_pressure/,Flair 58+ issues: can't keep high pressure,"I've been pulling shots with my Flair 58+ for the last few days, and it seems I can't fully grasp its working.

Some details of what I'm using: grinder is Lagom Casa 48 mm, basket is the high flow from Flair, puck screen is the newer thinner Flair one. Manual WDT. I've tamped with both the Flair palm tamper and also with a Normcore V4 spring loaded tamper, flat bottom. Beans I use are specialty arabica blend, signature blend that's been around for ages from a reputable roaster, espresso roasted (not nordic, so I guess proper medium roast) on 18/12/2024.

In my first few shots I ground too fine. my Lagom Casa has burr lock 1 small dot below 0, and anything from number 5 up to number 6 was choking the machine or run very slowly and long. 

I decided coarsen the grind size bit by bit (small dots after 6) and was able to pull shots that were visually ok, tidy, and cup taste was fine. The issue is that, by looking at the dial during the shots, I couldn't really control the measured pressure.

I tried to do shots with and without pre infusion (at around 3 bar until the first drops of coffee appeared from the basket, and this was achievable) but I couldn't really keep the shot brewing between 8 and 9 bar.  


I could achieve more like mid 7 to 8 bar as peak pressure (with a good amount of effort from my arm), but then I could feel the puck resistence eroding and pressure dropping to 6 and below, needing to ""spike"" the lever a bit to have the needle on the dial jumps up a bit, but I believe this is not the way it's supposed to be.

I then decided to coarsen the grind size by significant steps, aiming to find a spot where the shots run poorly and then moving back. at number 8 on my Lagom Casa the pressure control got slightly better, but I noticed a couple of rogue drops on the lid of the cup after pulling the shots and the acidity is starting to get definitely more present.

My idea is that I'm close to enter the ""too coarse"" territory (already had 2 shots today so can't verify) while still not able to keep the pressure high. I decided to ask here and see if there might be something else that could be the issue and not only grind size. 

Does anybody have an idea of what could be wrong / has my same grinder and can tell me their grind range?

1hr82j3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BestProductstoFind/comments/1hr82j3/how_does_beige_create_elegance_in_the_living_room/,How Does Beige Create Elegance In The Living Room?,"The Role of Beige in Creating a Sophisticated Living Room Atmosphere
--------------------------------------------------------------------

When you envision a sophisticated living room, the color beige often comes to mind. It’s not just a neutral. Beige brings a warm elegance that helps create a peaceful atmosphere. Using this versatile shade, you can foster an inviting space that feels both refined and comfortable. In this article, we'll explore how beige plays an essential role in achieving a sophisticated living area.

### Beige as a Base Color

One of the most effective ways to create an elegant living room is by choosing beige as a foundational color. Walls painted in a soft beige serve as a blank canvas, allowing other elements in the room to shine. Here’s how:

- **Versatility:** Beige pairs well with an array of colors, from bold shades to soft pastels.
- **Timeless Quality:** Unlike trendy colors, beige has a classic and enduring appeal that won’t go out of style.
- **Light Reflection:** Light beige tones reflect natural light beautifully, making the room feel more spacious and airy.

### Complementing Textures and Patterns

Beige isn't just about color; it’s also about texture. different materials can elevate the sophistication of your living room.

- **Soft Fabrics:** Think plush sofas and rich throw pillows. The softness creates a luxurious feel.
- **Natural Elements:** Adding wooden furniture, stone accents, or woven rugs introduces organic textures that complement beige.
- **Patterns:** Use subtle patterns like stripes or damask in beige upholstery to add depth without overwhelming the space.

### Creating a Monochromatic Scheme

A monochromatic color scheme based on beige can bring an elegant cohesion to your living room. This approach unifies different elements, creating a calming effect. Here’s how to achieve this:

- **Layering Shades:** Mix various shades of beige, from cream to taupe, for added interest.
- **Accent Pieces:** Introduce accessories like vases, lamps, and art that incorporate the shades of beige. This subtly ties together the overall look.
- **Balance with Contrast:** Dramatic contrasts with darker colors, like chocolate brown or charcoal gray, can make the beige elements pop while maintaining elegance.

### Enhancing with Accent Colors

While beige may be the primary color, adding accent colors can enhance its richness. The right colors can bring warmth and vibrancy, creating a sophisticated ambiance. Consider these options:

- **Warm Tones:** Colors like rust, burnt orange, or mustard yellow can add warmth without detracting from the elegance.
- **Cool Shades:** Soft blues or greens can create a refreshing contrast, while still maintaining a serene atmosphere.
- **Metallic Accents:** Gold or silver decor elements can reflect light and add a touch of glamour to your beige living room.

### The Role of Lighting

Lighting is crucial when working with beige. It can dramatically change how the color is perceived in the space. Here are a few tips for optimal lighting:

- **Natural Light:** Maximize natural light by keeping windows unobstructed. This enhances the warm tones of beige.
- **Layered Lighting:** Use a mix of ambient, task, and accent lighting to create a well-lit environment, with warm bulbs to maintain that elegant feel.
- **Statement Fixtures:** Bold light fixtures can serve as focal points, enhancing the sophistication associated with beige.

Incorporating beige into your living room is an effective way to create an elegant atmosphere. This neutral color acts as a wonderful backdrop that allows for flexibility in style and design. With the right textures, patterns, accent colors, and lighting, beige can transform your living space into a sophisticated haven. By considering these elements, you can craft a living room that is not only visually appealing but also warmly inviting.

Complementary Colors to Enhance the Elegance of a Beige Living Room
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Beige is a versatile color that effortlessly combines warmth and sophistication. When you choose beige for your living room, you set a calming atmosphere while allowing for numerous other colors to be introduced to enhance the space's elegance. The right complementary colors can accentuate the neutral tones of beige and bring out its innate charm.

### Understanding Complementary Colors

Complementary colors are hues that sit opposite each other on the color wheel. When used together, they create a balanced and vibrant composition. In a beige living room, complementary colors can help build a polished look without overwhelming the senses. Here are some excellent options to consider:

- **Soft Pastels:** Soft blues, greens, and pinks can add a touch of serenity to your beige backdrop.
- **Rich Jewel Tones:** Deep emerald, sapphire, or amethyst can bring a luxurious feel to your space.
- **Warm Earth Tones:** Shades of terracotta, rust, or mustard yellow provide an inviting warmth that pairs beautifully with beige.
- **Classic Black and White:** Striking contrasts with black and white accessories or furniture can infuse elegance and modern flair.

### Soft Pastels for a Serene Atmosphere

If you’re looking to create a calm retreat, consider soft pastels. Light blue, blush pink, or mint green can harmoniously complement beige while brightening the room. Throw pillows, artwork, or a subtle area rug in these pastel shades can create a soothing focal point. These hues can evoke a sense of peace and tranquility, making your living room inviting and relaxing.

### Rich Jewel Tones for Luxury

For those who desire a statement-making living room, rich jewel tones are an excellent choice. Dark emerald green or royal blue can add depth and richness to your space. Consider using velvet cushions, a bold accent chair, or even a dramatic piece of wall art to infuse these colors. Jewel tones stand out against beige, creating a striking visual appeal without sacrificing elegance.

### Warm Earth Tones for Comfort

Warm earth tones like terracotta and rust can create a cozy ambiance in your beige living room. These colors complement the natural warmth of beige while adding a grounded element to your design. Incorporate these tones through decorative elements such as ceramics, throw blankets, or potted plants. Together, beige and warm earth tones establish an inviting vibe that feels homey and comfortable.

### Classic Black and White for Timeless Elegance

The classic combination of black and white never goes out of style. Using these colors as accents against a beige backdrop can create a chic and contemporary look. Consider adding a black and white patterned area rug, framed black and white photos, or sleek furniture pieces in these colors. This combination helps to elevate the elegance of your living room, making it look well-curated and polished.

### Textures and Patterns Enhance Elegance

While color is crucial in a beige living room, the use of various textures and patterns can significantly enhance elegance as well. Consider mixing fabrics such as linen, wool, and silk in your decor. Adding a soft faux fur throw or a chunky knit blanket can make the space feel more inviting. Patterns like geometric designs or floral prints can add visual interest while combining seamlessly with the colors mentioned earlier.

### Accent Pieces for a Cohesive Look

To tie everything together, pay attention to your furniture and decorative accents. A well-chosen coffee table, side tables, or light fixtures in your selected complementary colors can harmonize your living room aesthetics. Ensure that your choices reflect your style while maintaining a cohesive look with the beige base.

Choosing the right complementary colors in your beige living room can transform the space from simple to exquisite. With the right palette, you can create an environment that feels both luxurious and welcoming. Don’t be afraid to experiment and let your personal style shine through while maintaining the elegance that beige effortlessly brings to your home.

### Conclusion

A well-designed living room is not just about aesthetics; it’s about creating an inviting atmosphere where you and your guests can feel comfortable and inspired. Beige plays a pivotal role in achieving this by providing a sophisticated backdrop that exudes warmth and tranquility. This neutral shade can make your space feel both elegant and timeless, allowing other elements in the room to shine without overwhelming the senses.

To enhance the elegance of a beige living room, consider incorporating complementary colors. Rich shades like deep navy or forest green can add depth and drama, while softer hues, such as blush pink or light gray, can maintain a serene and sophisticated vibe. Accessorizing with artwork, textiles, and accent furniture in these colors not only highlights the beige but also creates visual interest. Textured fabrics and metallic finishes can further elevate the space, introducing layers that resonate with luxury.

Ultimately, embracing beige as your primary color allows for versatile design possibilities. It sets the stage for a living room that can be both chic and cozy, where every piece feels thoughtfully placed. As you curate your space, remember that the magic lies in balancing elegance with comfort. When you choose shades and textures wisely, bisque becomes a canvas for your personal style, enriching your living room with grace and harmony. Whether it’s an intimate gathering or a lively celebration, a beige living room will always impress and welcome all who enter.

1hr80lc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hr80lc/ugh_help_me_analyze_this_text_convo_kind_of_a_rant/,UGH HELP ME ANALYZE THIS TEXT CONVO 😖 (kind of a rant),"Basically, there's this guy \[M 19\]. And I \[M 19\] like him a lot. But he also does *not* reply quickly. Like, the average response time is anywhere from 2-4 hours. And I think I could live with that if the responses I was getting back were substantive, but they're kinda all just snaps w/o words.

Now, in total fairness to him, his screen time is \~2 hours per day. But at the same time Snap for some reason says he's always online, and *sometimes* his snap score goes up and up while I'm left on delivered (and I'm not saying he should text his friends less—it's good that he has people to talk to—but it would be nice if he could just send me a text when he got a minute).

I scheduled a face time with him (which felt weird, but I didn't want to call at a bad time), but he ended up running 40 minutes late. We've actually never called over the phone, which bugs me, but that's another matter entirely. I'm now giving him the space to ask about rescheduling. If he's interested in calling, he will, and if he's not, then oh well.

In person, things are all right. He's still *really* bad at being in contact irl (I don't think we've ever just texted back and forth), but in person, he's really sweet and thoughtful. He's *so* cute, and the sex is honestly really good. We met during finals season, so I told myself that he was probably just busy with preparing for that. But things really haven't gotten better over break.

My friends think I should leave, but that's kinda not the answer I want to hear. I just want to open up communication. But I also want him to want to communicate. I thought if I gave him a bit of time he would naturally take some initiative, but that doesn't seem to be the case. Basically, I don't want him to feel like this not-relationship is a chore, but it would be *so nice* if he called like once or twice a week for half an hour. Honestly, it would make me the happiest boy in the world.

But anyway, without further ado, here's what I texted after we couldn't FaceTime. Please help me know what I should be taking away from this/if I broached it wrong.

Me:

Also, here's the part where I go over some of the things I was going to say verbally.

Basically, I like you, like a lot. And it's weird, and this is kinda new for me, and I'm trying to do everything right. I'm trying to check off all the important boxes. And it would make me feel infinitely better if I could just make sure we're on the same page w/ some of these things.

1. Are we boyfriends? Should I tell people that, or not tell people anything, or should I say this is a situationship or what
2. I get not being super into texting, and this might not make a lot of sense (I'll workshop it), but like, I want to know what you're thinking. And it just confuses me a little bit when the fastest I'm going to get a response is like four hours. Like, if you feel like I'm coming on too strongly when I reply quickly, just let me know and I can be more...idk judicious with my responses. But I kind of like being able to go back and forth with people, either over phone or text or really fast carrier pigeon And 3.) I want you to live your life. I don't want you to have to restructure your calendar to fit me in it.

Oh and 4.) If it wasn't already readily apparent, I'm kinda a little insecure, and I don't love admitting that. But I also can't read minds, and if there's ever something your thinking, you should just say it bc otherwise the odds are not in your favor that I'll be able to guess it right.

And I should have said this sooner, but I was telling myself that if I was this explicit you'd take it the wrong way-l'm just the type of person that needs things to be clearly delineated and defined (I have a very poor sense of subtlety)

Him:

hey thank you for like reaching out about you 

I think like continuing the convo had that time we got coffee like after Thanksgiving, from my POV idk what I'm really looking for rn if that's a relationship or not I don't know — I think we should talk when we get back cuz I wanna hear your perspective cuz that's important to me what you're thinking

I really like seeing you and talking and spending time and I definitely want to continue with that - having never done this before, l'd think it's best to go into this with no explicit expectations of say, a relationship or not, and see where this evolves naturally (again I wanna see you when we get back and we should have this convo irl)

1hr80bl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AngelNumbers101/comments/1hr80bl/how_do_i_know_when_im_seeing_an_angel_number_or/,How do I know when I'm seeing an angel number or just a coincidence?,"You know you’re seeing an angel number when a specific number sequence keeps appearing to you repeatedly, often in unexpected ways, and it feels like more than a coincidence. It’s not just about noticing a random set of numbers; it’s about the timing, frequency, and how it makes you pause and wonder.

For example, imagine you’ve been thinking about starting a new project, and every time you check the clock, it’s 11:11, or your receipt at the coffee shop shows $11.11. At first, you might shrug it off as chance, but when the same number keeps showing up in meaningful moments, it starts to feel like a gentle nudge from the universe. That’s the essence of angel numbers—they’re about patterns that catch your attention and seem to align with your thoughts or emotions at the time.

The key difference between an angel number and a coincidence is the connection you feel to the number when you notice it. Let’s say you’re going through a tough time, and you keep seeing 444 on street signs, phone numbers, or even while scrolling through Instagram. If you feel comforted or reassured every time it pops up, that’s a strong sign it’s an angel number. In numerology, 4 is associated with stability and support, so seeing it repeatedly might feel like a message to stay grounded and trust that things will work out.

Still, it’s easy to wonder if you’re just imagining it. After all, our brains are great at spotting patterns, especially when we’re looking for them. But even if angel numbers are just coincidences, they can still be meaningful if you choose to see them that way. They’re like little reminders to stop, reflect, and reconnect with your inner thoughts or intentions. In a way, whether they’re “real” or not matters less than the impact they have on your mindset.

One way to tell if a number has significance is to pay attention to how it shows up in your life. Is it always tied to a specific thought, feeling, or situation? For instance, if you see 555 every time you’re considering a big life change, like moving to a new city, it might feel like a sign to embrace the transformation. Angel numbers often appear when you’re seeking clarity or direction, acting as subtle cues to help you trust your instincts.

Another clue is the way it makes you feel. Angel numbers tend to resonate on an emotional or intuitive level. If you notice a pattern and feel a sense of curiosity, peace, or even excitement, that’s worth exploring. On the other hand, if you see a number repeatedly but don’t feel any connection to it, it might just be a coincidence—and that’s okay too.

One fun way to deepen your awareness is to keep a little journal or mental log of the numbers you notice. Write down where and when they appear, and what’s going on in your life at that moment. Over time, you might see a pattern emerge, and that can help you decide if it’s meaningful. For example, you might realize that every time you’re doubting yourself, the number 777 shows up, which is often linked to spiritual alignment and encouragement to trust the journey.

At the end of the day, angel numbers are what you make of them. Whether you believe they’re divine messages or just a cool way to connect with your intuition, they’re a reminder to stay present and mindful. So, the next time you notice a number that makes you pause, take a moment to reflect—what’s been on your mind, and how does this number make you feel? Even if it’s “just a coincidence,” it could be the little spark you need to gain some clarity or confidence. And hey, a bit of extra magic in your life never hurts, right?

I like my clear (triton) Aeropress very much, it has become part of my morning routine and I wonder now how I managed without it. I bought it originally as a travel coffee solution, hotel coffee is very variable to say the least, but it now has a place in my kitchen permanently. I was thinking if I also bought the Premium I could have plastic one in my travel bag and the premium in the kitchen but I can see some possible downsides to the Premium.

1hr7xvo,https://www.reddit.com/r/colonoscopy/comments/1hr7xvo/my_very_positive_colonoscopy_experience_as_an/,My very positive colonoscopy experience as an anxious person,"I really wanted to share my positive colonoscopy experience as a 24F with wretched health anxiety who is very prone to doomscrolling before any medical appointment.

Some months ago, I drank too much coffee and was left with pretty hard stool that resulted in a tiny bit of blood when wiping.

Fast forward to an unrelated appointment with my doctor, I decided to mention the blood as a throwaway comment. She immediately suggested a colonoscopy to make sure everything was up to snuff, as my father has UC, Crohn's, and early stage colon cancer (more on that later).

It was a 6 month wait for an appointment, so I had forgotten about it when I got the call.

Cue the panic. I assumed I'd be out cold, but where I live, they use conscious sedation (Fentanyl and Versed). What if it doesn't work?   I read that younger women tend to have twistier colons that can result in painful scopes, and some of the horror stories on this subreddit scared me senseless. 

What's more, my own father had his colon perforated during a routine colonoscopy, but it was also a life-saving procedure, since they discovered early stage colon cancer and decided to remove his colon to be safe. 

And about prep: Mine was Colyte and two Bisacodyl tablets. I was worried about stomach cramping, general discomfort, but most importantly, vomiting. What if I vomit and am unable to finish prep? 

Well, much ado about nothing. The taste of the Colyte, to me, was like salty bubblegum. Not great, but not disgusting. I used a large glass boba straw to get it down and drank Gatorade in between glasses.

The laxative tablets were very gentle as well.

I had no stomach cramping, no vomiting (and believe me, I have a sensitive stomach), no pain at all.

The most annoying part was having to go to the bathroom so often, but it really just felt like peeing out of your bum. I used a portable bidet, baby wipes and diaper rash cream to help. My butt has never felt cleaner.

The procedure itself was so easy. I had a BPM of 140 when the nurse was taking my vitals. She let the specialist know I was very anxious. I asked her about pain during the procedure and appreciated her honesty. She said some people fall asleep, others do experience some pain, but it is different for everyone. I asked about perforation, she said it was very rare, and only happens when removing polyps, which they were unlikely to find at my age.

When I was in the procedure room, she suggested deep breathing and to just let go when the meds were administered instead of trying to see the screen and maintain awareness. 

A few seconds after the IV was in, I was out. I came to to a voice saying it was done and being wheeled into the recovery room!

The results? Nothing. All clear. I left the recovery room after 20 minutes, and my partner took me out for a burger, fries and milkshake.  

I am really glad to have the peace of mind now that it's all said and done, and I don't have to come back until I'm 50.

TL;DR: Don't doomscroll through colonoscopy horror stories before your procedure. Pay attention to the positive stories. Prep is uncomfortable but a walk in the park compared to colon cancer. The procedure is different for everyone, but I was knocked out even with conscious sedation, and it was over before I knew it. Coming from someone with health anxiety to spare, you can do it!!!!

So I pop my adderal early  and start playing chess and drinking coffee. I crushed 5 1500 elo players in a row. Off to a good start. 

I only had a few goals to accomplish that day: full body workout (takes 2.25 hours). A 1.5 hour walk. Head shave, stubble trim and shower. Then a grocery store trip because it was the last day of the sales.

As usual, chess, coffee, internet and a tv show or 3 kept from starting my tasks until 10am. My workout ran long because I was tired after 1.5 hours of pull ups and Bulgarian split squats. So I rested a bit before my 40min of push-ups. By the time I finished my walk, it was already 5pm. Grooming regime makes it 6pm. Now I really don't want to go to the store. I have to go to 3 stores. It's sure to be busy. And I planed on going to bed at 8pm. But I decide its non-negotiable. Miraculously make it home by 7:30.

For context on how he ended up living with me: When we met I was working 2 jobs and had my own apartment, a nice car, etc. When we met He lived with friends and didn’t have a job, his reason was that he was a live-in nanny for the family and so he was able to stay there rent free, food free etc. and basically had money coming through them with him helping out so much. Not unheard of, okay. 

As we became serious he was home less and the wife specifically had it out for me and said I had ill intentions, whatever that means (*I think looking back she liked him or just was mad he was living there and not able to help like before*) and persistently told him deliberate lies about me. Like, lies so off the wall I could easily debunk. 

So we had a conversation and he moved in with me. Obviously getting a job and helping with bills was a no brainer, I asked him to split half of those with me. I learned not as quickly as I should have that he was hiding alcoholism from me and he has major mental health issues. 

In the time we’ve lived together, he has split 2 rents with me. Our rent was $800 but now it’s $1100, and on top of all of the other bills I have.  He will work a max of 2 weeks and quit a job, I see none of that money. I was letting him use my car to DoorDash and when I would even ask for a coffee he would tell me no. In the worst of his alcohol addiction he’s cheated on me twice that I know of, crashed my car while I was in beauty school, I would go to school from 7am-3pm and then work 4pm-10pm also while working a remote job on top of this and I would have to walk home with a 40lb salon kit every day in the Midwest at the end of my day, to wake up and do it all over again. He’s strangled me and has thrown vapes at me so hard they literally will explode into pieces. He’s broken 3 phones I have gotten him, and punched my mac laptop to pieces. I am a video editor and designer and many of my projects at the time were not backed up. Hes thrown my phone off of the 3rd floor balcony. He mocks me when I have panic attacks and when I cry. I cook every meal we eat and I clean my house the best that I can. 

When he crashed my car while I was in school, he blamed me because “I made him go to a job interview,” told me he wasn’t responsible and had no obligation to help me get another. 

The stress of everything became too much and I couldn’t afford to get another car or Uber everywhere I needed since my school was 45 minutes from where I live. I had to drop out with 500 hours left. 

I lost my remote job in August of this year because they couldn’t afford me anymore. The weight of everything without being able to rest or heal has been absolutely unbearable. I took myself to the hospital because I wanted to off myself. 

We got in a fight in September after he quit his 1 week job and after this fight, he decided to get mental health help and to stop drinking. He was diagnosed bipolar with PTSD and has been on medication for it. Things have basically been flipped right side up when it comes to his mental health. He’s been so kind and much more understanding. He just hasn’t gotten a job yet. 

So now that I caught you up with history, this week:

I have a UTI I’m on antibiotics for, but I was throwing up 5 days prior to Christmas. I was throwing up on Christmas and I made him Christmas dinner while he played the Xbox360 I got him (I didn’t even get a free gift like a love letter by the way) and while slicing a block of cheese with a slicer my finger slipped, causing me to cut the corner of my ring finger off. Through my nail and nail bed. I ended up going to the ER on Christmas (oh by the way my brother got arrested at my house the day before on Christmas Eve. Different story) also while puking. 

So I was throwing up for about a week, had a sliced finger, and then came home to finish cooking Christmas dinner - I have cooked every single breakfast lunch and dinner since Christmas and I have done every dish between. I had to find latex gloves to protect my finger for this. 

It snowed here, and my current car has a cracked rotor and a blown head gasket I think. It’s a death trap. It’s new years so I was going to doordash some coffees from a local shop and we loovveee avocado toast so I was going to DoorDash the fixings for it. 

I asked him if since my finger was still tender, and I’m ordering fancy coffees, if he’d mind making us breakfast today. He literally told me no he doesn’t want to. I kind of threw my head back and said okay no problem. He said “great, this is how today is gonna be huh” and laid down. I said “I’m confused, I didn’t even say anything. I wish that you saw I’ve been doing all of the dishes and cooking since I’ve been sick and my finger is kinda just literally hanging by some glue right now” 🤣 and said he “fucking hates making toast.” Dude. What 😭

Okay, if I toast the bread will you do everything else? No. 

He laid down and is completely ignoring me now. *I’m* the one who made today horrible. How dare I ask for an ounce of help. 

I know what I need to do. I cannot do it. If nothing changes I will get there and I know I will because I am finally feeling that pull. I’m thinking the, if I leave I’m moving states away thoughts. Anybody can tell me to leave and I physically still hurt at the thought. He’s grown so much. I was in therapy doing EMDR to help with my childhood trauma and wounds, I just don’t have a car to get me there anymore. 

I canceled the order and I feel an overwhelming anger inside of me. I want to go eat a whole pack of edibles and lock myself and my puppy away. Not because I wanted a fancy coffee, TRUST ME THOUGH I DO!! 😭I’m a coffee snob and it’s a comfort self care thing for me. I’m angry that somebody can take the life out of me, decide to change when the damage was already done and then do nothing to repair it. Even something small like make fucking toast. 

It’s days like today that make me want to drive my sad ass as far as my car will take me with my puppy in the back seat. 

Probably about 10 miles. Thanks for reading and listening to my rant. I hope your 2025 is better than your 2024 🫶🏼

However, by the time the decoction is fully dripped, it cools down significantly. Even though we boil the milk 2-3 times before adding it, the coffee still isn’t hot enough to drink. We even tried reheating the decoction once, but while we got the heat, the taste was completely off.

My name is Daniel and I'm a 29-year-old software engineer based here in NYC. I currently live in a studio which I don't love, so I'm looking to move pretty soon, sometime in January or early February. I'm working with a broker who specializes in luxury buildings throughout the city. They tend to be a bit pricey, so usually what they do is take a larger one bedroom and put up a flex wall, so it works as a 2-bedroom. I’ve lived in one before and it works well. The flex wall can go up to the ceiling like a regular wall, and functions as a real wall. I’ve lived in this kind of situation before and can send pics of my old place if you’d like to get a sense of what it looks like. 

I really love living in luxury buildings because they tend to have lots of amenities, like gym, doormen, rooftops, and other things like that. The broker said there should be some inventory once the new year hits (after Jan 2nd), so I’m waiting to hear back from him sometime later this week / early next week. I would prefer to have the true bedroom, so if you don’t mind you would be taking the flex, and paying less. Usually the apartments go for like 4200 or 4300, so split you would be paying closer to 2,100 and I’d be paying 2,300 or something around that. 

A bit about me: In my free time I enjoy exploring the city, going to dinner, the movies, shows, and just generally taking in all the city has to offer. I work in my office in the financial district between 4 and 5 days per week, \~9 hours per day, and in the evenings like going to the gym, meeting up with friends, or just having a nice lounge night in with some TV. I’m pretty friendly and easy-going, and am looking for a roommate who is similar. I’ve had many roommates over the years, and it’s always been a pleasant experience for me. I do like to keep the apartment relatively clean (I have a great vacuum I can bring!), and prefer to have our apartment be a haven where we can come home and relax. I enjoy having people over occasionally, but am not someone who brings the party home. I’m a non-smoker myself — I don’t mind if you do, but prefer to keep that outside of the apartment. I also have a couch, a rug, a big TV, a coffee table, a shoe bench, and a dish set I can bring!

If this interests you, please let me know! Would love to set up a time to chat.",3,1735752678.0,NYCapartments,2,0.67,False

i am looking for peoples opinions on their preferences. 

personally i have always enjoyed a lungo, your regular espresso with extra volume of water run through the shot. 

I was thinking about how when I have worked in coffee shops that we were given a tolerance for extraction times and some shops do not check the yeald and it is up to us as baristas to serve what we want to serve as long as it fits a rough recipe. so a finer grinds to add extra extraction time.



what are peoples opinions on the way it effects the taste, is there a significant difference in the taste, amount of sweetness lost, does one add extra depth and so on.



opinions would be appreciated",2,1735752566.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

We were so excited! Our OB said “looks like there’s just one in there!!” Then she dug around a little more…. And she said “I may have spoken too soon.”  

We’re thrilled and scared and I feel like I’m mourning the singleton pregnancy and newborn phase that I don’t even know yet. My sisters are twins (identical) and while they LOVE being twins and my parents did a wonderful job raising them both, I always said I wouldn’t want twins for my first pregnancy. I have visions of taking my newborn to a coffee shop in a carrier by myself and making Target runs with one little baby. 

I am feeling so many conflicting emotions. I don’t know how we’re going to do it. We live in a small 1bedroom that we decided we were going to stay in with a newborn since they’d be in our room for a few months anyway. Now… I feel like we have to purchase a house early (which is scary with the upcoming expenses of twins). I also wanted a water birth at a birthing center which is now off the table. 

All this to say, we’ve barely been digesting this for 24 hours. I’m happy and feel bad that I even have any negative thoughts… but I’m a little terrified for it all. Did things ever start to feel more OK and less scary, or were you winging it through to toddlerhood? Is there any advice that helped you through the shock of twins?

There's PEOPLE here and I just can't start tripping balls and literally seeing how that variety-pack box of cheetos over there is really just a physical representation of spiritual energy and seeing everything being made of crystallized spirt-light! I just can't right now! I just had my pop tarts and I need a cup of coffee... can we PLEASE just not do this right this second?"" 

Luckily, they backed off for now but I had to promise to go to the park later and I guess I'm going to have to go and deal with this in a couple of hours or so... any advice for how I can let this hit me and not act like a freaking psych-patient when I come back to the house? After all my previous ones, I was in a pretty severely altered state of conciousness for days after, and I guess this one is probably going to be the same way. It's always a really positive experience for me, but the people around me usually think that I've lost my mind, which is sort of sad because normally it just results in me being all super happy and trying to spread love and light around, and I guess that looks crazy to a lot of people... 

Anyways, just needed to vent this, and ask for any advice. My guides are really cool, but they don't really have a lot of respect for how other people see me, and they don't really mind if I look crazy from time to time. Their view on the matter is ""who cares what those people think? If they woke up then they would see how awesome you really are!"" But I try to explain that in human society you can't just walk around talking to things that no one else sees, and giving presents to trees and stuff like that, because that sort of gets you put in a hospital. We've come to a sort of compromise, but they still think im being silly for not wanting to go all in and just stay rooted I the spirit world 100% of the time.

I read a lot of sci-fi and dystopian fiction and I often wonder if we lived on Mars and landed on Earth, how we would be stunned by our planet's plants, animals and fungi. We live on Eden. There is no way another plants has this natural diversity. Here are some examples:

platypus, giraffe, armadillo, sea horse, octopus,
hummingbirds, African Grey Parrots (who understand language and often have vocabularies of 1000 words).

Socotra Dragon Tree which looks like it's from another planet, giant bamboo forests, bleeding heart plant, sunflowers

fungi (thousands of varieties) which we've recently discovered allows trees to communicate (plus some feed you, trip you or kill you).

I haven't touched on microbes or insects (bumblebee I see you).

Humans will probably kill themselves off but the planet will recover (we saw a surge of this during COVID when car use dropped and cruise ships took a break).

(F34/M32)","TLDR - My ex (F 34) broke no contact after ending our 3-year relationship. We had 3 solid weeks of reconnection but now she has gone cold. Do I go back into no contact? Is this normal? 

More info - My ex (F 34) and I (M 32) broke up and went straight into no contact. I was sad but wanted to respect her decision. After about 2 months she reached out and pushed to meet for coffee. This sparked a three-week ""reconnection period"" where we saw each other multiple times, had sleepovers, and texted every day in between meet-ups. 

All of our interactions were positive, fun, sexy, and loving. It felt at one point like we were back in our relationship which was really nice. 

We both travelled to opposite sides of the country to spend Christmas with our families. Communication slowed down but I felt it was expected as we were busy.  

But... now I have not heard from her for a week after our convo fizzled. I am probably overthinking things here... but it just feels strange as before this she had been pushing the convo forward each day.   
  
The only thing I can think of is the last time we were together, she said ""we should probably talk about things"" to which I responded ""I agree, but let's do that in the new year since we're both going away for xmas"" as it was late at night, and felt like the wrong time. She agreed. 

Do I reach out to her and keep convo going? Or do I hold back and wait for her to initiate? I heard about something called ""positive pullback"" which is when an ex becomes emotionally confused after reconnecting and ""pumps the breaks"" or withdraws completely. Pretty much all the advice seems to be to do nothing. To not react, or reach out and wait for them to come back to you to avoid putting more pressure on them and pushing them further away.    
  
I would like to start a new relationship with her, but recognize that we need to reconnect more before we are able to have those bigger conversations. I am worried the 3-weeks we had will go to waste! Although a friend who has gotten back with an ex before said it is not a linear journey. You will go through many speed-ups and slow-downs. 

Also worth noting is that we did have a period of on-off again in the past... maybe this is just a pattern. Any advice is wanted! ",1,1735752236.0,relationship_advice,1,0.67,False

1hr7g06,https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/1hr7g06/someone_slandered_and_tarnished_my_good_name_in/,Someone slandered and tarnished my good name in Church and that was the final straw for me,"Hey guys, 33M here.  This is going to be a long post. Apologies in advance! 

I have always had a love hate relationship with Christianity. It would always come and go in phases. I would have periods where I could be really intense where I'd go to the church and become super active. Other times I feel I need a break from the church and step aside for a few months. 7 weeks ago after a long period of dormancy I decided to give church another go. I set myself an ultimatum. This will be the LAST time I try and really get into the Christian life and if it doesn't work I will decide to leave religion behind for good because the constant on and off habit is not good for my well being. 

I found a good church. It's a vineyard church. Apparently a mix between evangelical and pentecostal. I looked at their website and it sounded good at the time. Their values lined up with what I then believed to be true and good. I was instantly hooked! I decided from day one to be active in the church. I helped set up tea and coffee in the morning , talked to everyone , and even joined their small groups . 

I was placed in a small group with people ranging from 18 years of age to 35. So quite young. We met every Tuesday night at this girl's house who was around 24 and she was the host. We were doing a course on 'practicing the way' and I had a lot of catch up reading to do because I was placed half way the course into the group. But I didn't mind. I felt right at home. She was really welcoming ( as were the rest of the group members). It felt really safe so I decided to open up and be vulnerable . I talked about how I didn't have an easy life. How I was always bullied  and how I suffer from low self esteem because of it. I built walls around myself and guarded my heart always. However because it felt safe I finally let my guard down and boy did that feel good. I finally felt like my life was about to make a U-turn for the better.

However, the weeks went by and I began to feel uneasy in the church. I felt people were being really nervous around me, always looking down when I talked to them , some even walked the other way as I started walking towards them. I didn't understand this behavior at all. Then and there the pastor came up to me and said he needed to have a word with me. He led me into a room and proceeded to talk. Apparently that same girl from the small group told an elder in the church that she  feels unsafe around me and she said that I am a 'danger to society' and that she wants to 'warn people about me'. I was COMPLETELY flabbergasted . I didn't know what to make of it at that time. I asked the pastor why she thinks that. He said that he didn't know why but he did tell me he has to make an immediate decision . He told me he will remove me from the small group. At this point I was pissed off. These are serious allegations and without a shred of evidence he removed me from the small group where I felt at home. I told him I will need some time to digest this information. I felt numb. I really did .

I got home that day and the moment I closed the door I broke down and sobbed uncontrollably . Sadness and feelings of worthlessness consumed me. This wasn't a 'my football team lost' kinda sobbing feeling. This was the most painful sobbing I have ever felt in my life. Every sob and tear I shed was followed by a painful scream. It's really hard to describe . I felt like someone just ripped my heart out my chest. For the next 5 hours I was curled into a ball on my bed. I felt vulnerable, unheard, mad, sad and hurt all at the same time. I then somehow managed to compose myself and message the pastor saying that I would really like to schedule a meeting with the girl , me and the pastor because this is not ok and needs to be delt with swifty. She can't just say stuff like that and get away with it. To my surprise the pastor didn't know if talking was a good idea and that he stands by his decision to remove me from the small group. I was pissed off. I messaged him saying I disagreed with him and because of her allegations against me and the church's way of handling it I decided to leave the church. He said he is sorry i felt the way I felt and wished me well. That infuriated me even more. No where in any of his statements did he EVER say what she did was bad. NEVER. As if they are taking her side . 

I didn't reply anymore to him. I felt he doesn't deserve my attention if he's going to treat me this way. I felt like he just wants to sweep this whole incident under the rug and forget about it. I tried for the next few days to put this all behind me but I couldn't . I continued sobbing day in day out. I even almost broke down in the supermarket. I was luckily able to rush to my car in the parking lot where I was able to sob and scream. When I got home I decided enough is enough. I looked up 'slander' into Google and the first link that popped up was a government website for people who are victims of a crime. Without hesitation I decided to call. A man answered and he said 'hey there, how are you how can we help'. The way he said it felt so warm , so welcoming and so lovely . It was EXACTLY what I needed to hear and at that point I knew this was a safe space and I just completely broke down again. I finally felt heard and understood. He told me that what she did was indeed a crime and that the pastor could have handled things better. He even said he was sorry this happened to me. It felt so nice for someone to finally acknowledge my feelings. I was so happy I finally had someone to talk to to get through things. 

However the worst was yet to come. The church is very small ( around 100 people) so everyone was in one Whatsapp group. It's mainly to share lovely bible passages and also announce events and stuff. I decided the next best thing was to send out a generic message to the group saying I am leaving the church because it wasn't a good fit. Only one person ever replied to that message. It was that SAME GIRL. The one who completely tarnished my good name, slandering me and made me feel like a worthless turd even after I was NOTHING but nice to her. She said 'oooo I'm so sorry to hear that, I wish you nothing but kindness , lots of love and God Bless'. That PISSED ME OFF big time!!. The audacity of her. NEVER  in my life have I actually hated anyone, be she is really pushing the envelope there.  Of course I tried my best to rise above it and show I'm the bigger and better person. And that's exactly what I did. 

This all happened 2 weeks ago. I have contacted everyone in that church but to this day I still haven't gotten a straight answer, just crickets. I might have to accept the fact that I will never understand why she said the things she said or why they condone her actions. To get stabbed in the back and tarnished after you show vulnerability and kindness is worst pain I have ever felt in my life. She took away my trust in people, my hope in society. I cry everytime I think about this and thank goodness for the governmental victim help line. 

As per me leaving the church I am no longer a practicing christian nor will I ever attend church ever again. I have denounced the Holy Spirit and now identify as an atheist. I have to protect my heart now because no one can ever EVER hurt me like that again.

I like to thank those who have taken the time to read my post. Thanks for bearing with me here I know it's long . I just needed to get it all out in the open.

TLDR: someone in the church slandered me by saying 'i am a danger to society' and without any evidence I was kicked out of the church activities. After a painful emotional period left the church leaving Christianity behind for good. ",8,1735752085.0,exchristian,5,1.0,False

(If you've messaged me before, feel free to message me again!) I am looking for a serious traditional gender roles relationship within the USA (I am willing to relocate eventually for the right person!) Everyday I strive to be a better version of myself, with God's help❤️ Below are some things about me:

• Curly haired down to shoulders natural burnette (currently dyed black and red but will be soon dyeing it all black for winter)
•Green/blue eyes and glasses
•25 years old, birthday is in the summer
•Thick/BBW/Curvy (on a weightloss journey though!)
•German and Irish ancestry (this means I'm really pale)
•Wonderful with cooking and baking (my grandma taught me how to cook and bake)
•Gardening and farm experience
•Christian- I always strive to be a Proverbs 31 woman
•Wants kids someday
•Wishes to be a stay at home wife and work on my work from home career goal
•Educated in mental health so very good at reading people and what they may need (will be putting my future husband's needs above all else, especially mentally and emotionally and of course physically)
•Believes that men should be the ones to lead and take charge as their woman follows them
•Dreams of being able to pack my future man lunches to take to work with little notes in them
•Very positive outlook on life (will be your number one supporter)


Ideally You:


•27-45 years old
•Strong work ethic/Hard worker
•Wants kids and some animals (you have to at least tolerate cats, they're my favorite animal)
•Wants something serious
•Ideally also Christian and wants to go to church together (Bible study date anyone?)
•Wants a stay at home wife to take care of the house and children
•A good sense of humor
•Will lift me up with support and not tear me down



Ideal timeline (if not sooner):


•date living apart - 6months to 1year
•date living together - 6months to 1year
•engaged and then married - maximum of 1year (have at least a wedding date planned)
•trying for kids - right away after being married






Here's a little about what I look forward to:


I'll get up early while he still sleeps and get his lunch ready, pack a little note in there. If it's cold out, I'll throw his coat or jacket in the dryer for a few minutes to make sure he's nice and toasty, get his morning coffee ready in a thermos and a quick homemade breakfast like biscuits and gravy or protein pancakes with banana slices and chocolate chips so he can feel full until lunch, sigh it's the dream. Not to mention when he gets home from work, having dinner ready like my grandma's recipe for homemade chicken and dumplings or my secret recipe for pot roast with blackberry cobbler and vanilla ice cream for dessert. Having him settle on the couch and relax while I clean up the kitchen and load the dishwasher, coaxing him to get in the shower so he can clean off all the grime from the day and throwing the towel in the dryer so it's nice and warm for when he gets out. Then having him put his head in my lap while we watch tv in the living room so I can play with hair or scratch his back. Just the little things honestly🥹 I wanna accompany my guy with his hobbies even if I'm not into it myself, be a presence and help where I can, when it's time to unwind, watch him mess around in the shop/garage or watch some TV together, me reading or writing while he's doing his own thing just enjoying each other's company, ending the night with cuddles as he falls asleep while I scratch his back, knowing tomorrow will be the same thing all over again

I've had myself convinced that I need to do a Stage 2 build on the 212 to reach that goal, but the 79cc has 3HP (just has intake and exhaust, but still has the governor) hits 40 on whatever tires came on it from TractorSupply. The 212 has 6.5 and with the governor removed I'd be willing to be it makes 7-7.5 and Stage 1 a couple more. By tripling the power of the 79 I see 65-70 being possible without digging to far into the motor for crank, head, etc, but obviously flywheel and other things for peace of mind. 

I just wanted to reach out and ask about gearing for the desired speed (or faster without sacrificing down low) and Stage 1 or Stage 2 build on the motor. Thank you and you have a great day!

Imagine waking up every morning and feeling like you’re dragging yourself through a fog. That was my life—a constant battle with low energy, weight that stubbornly refused to budge, and a metabolism slower than a snail on vacation. I’d tried everything: diets, exercise plans, fancy meal prep boxes, and even those “magic” pills that promised overnight results but delivered nothing but frustration. Sound familiar?

One day, as I was sipping my morning coffee, I stumbled upon something that changed everything. It wasn’t a magic wand or an instant fix—it was a little secret I’d overlooked. And the best part? It fit seamlessly into my routine. No overhauling my life, no choking down chalky shakes, no setting alarms for complicated schedules. Just me, my coffee, and a sachet of pure potential.

Let me tell you, the first week was subtle, almost like a whisper. But by day three, something shifted. I didn’t hit that usual mid-afternoon slump that sent me reaching for another shot of espresso or a sugary snack. My energy felt natural, steady, like my body had rediscovered its rhythm. And that’s when I knew: this wasn’t just another hype product. It was working.

Within a month, the results spoke louder than words. My jeans fit better, and I was down a solid eight pounds without obsessing over every calorie or logging endless miles on the treadmill. But it wasn’t just about the weight. My mornings became brighter—literally. I’d wake up refreshed, ready to tackle the day with a kind of clarity I hadn’t felt in years.

Now, I know what you’re thinking: “Okay, but what’s the catch?” That’s exactly where I was before I gave this a shot. Here’s the thing—it’s not a gimmick. It’s science. It works with your body, not against it. The ingredients are clean, natural, and carefully chosen to supercharge your metabolism and optimize your energy levels. No jitters, no crash—just real, sustainable results.

The transformation wasn’t just physical. There was a mental and emotional shift too. Feeling healthier, lighter, and more energized gave me back my confidence. That spark I thought I’d lost? It was right there, waiting to be reignited. Friends started asking what I was doing differently. My answer? “I just started saying yes to myself.”

I’ll admit, I was skeptical at first. Aren’t we all? But sometimes, the biggest breakthroughs come when you take a chance. I didn’t change everything overnight, but this small change made a massive impact. It wasn’t about perfection—it was about progress. One decision, one habit, and a ripple effect that touched every part of my life.

Here’s the deal: if you’ve ever felt stuck, exhausted, or like your body is working against you, don’t settle for less. You don’t have to accept fatigue or a sluggish metabolism as your norm. I’m living proof that a small, intentional shift can unlock the potential you didn’t even know you had.

Now, every morning when I brew my coffee, I smile because I know what’s coming—a burst of energy, a sense of control, and the confidence that I’m on the right path. This journey wasn’t about quick fixes or empty promises. It was about finding something that worked for me—and it can work for you too.

All it takes is a single step forward. So, what are you waiting for? The best version of you is just a sip away.

**The Science Behind the Transformation**

After my personal experience, I became curious about why this simple addition to my coffee was working so effectively. What I discovered only deepened my trust in it. The secret lies in the carefully formulated combination of natural ingredients designed to supercharge your metabolism and ignite your body’s fat-burning capabilities.

**Boosting Metabolism with Green Tea Extract**

Green tea extract is a powerhouse of antioxidants, particularly catechins. These compounds work to enhance your body’s natural metabolic rate, meaning you burn calories more efficiently throughout the day. What makes it even better? This process doesn’t stop when you’re at rest. It promotes a constant state of fat oxidation, helping your body use stored fat as energy.

**Green Coffee Bean Extract: A Hidden Gem**

Another star ingredient is green coffee bean extract, which contains chlorogenic acid. This compound is known for its ability to reduce the absorption of carbohydrates in the digestive tract, effectively lowering blood sugar levels and preventing fat storage. It also supports fat metabolism, turning your body into a lean, energy-efficient machine.

**L-Carnitine: The Fat-Burning Amino Acid**

L-Carnitine is an amino acid your body naturally produces, but supplementation can make a big difference. Its primary role is to transport fatty acids into your cells' mitochondria, where they’re burned for energy. This helps your body tap into fat stores, enhancing energy levels while promoting weight loss.

**L-Theanine: A Perfect Partner for Caffeine**

Caffeine is already known for its metabolism-boosting properties, but when paired with L-Theanine, it becomes even more effective. L-Theanine is an amino acid found in tea leaves that promotes relaxation without drowsiness. Together, they create a focused, calm energy that enhances your mental clarity and prevents the jittery side effects often associated with caffeine.

**Chromium for Blood Sugar Control**

One of the unsung heroes in the formula is chromium, a trace mineral that helps regulate blood sugar levels. By improving insulin sensitivity, it minimizes the likelihood of sudden sugar crashes or cravings, making it easier to stick to healthier eating habits.

**Essential Vitamins: The Supportive Boost**

Java Burn also includes vitamins D, B6, and B12, which play crucial roles in supporting energy production, immune function, and overall health. These essential nutrients ensure your body operates at peak performance while keeping fatigue at bay.

**How It Works Together**

What makes Java Burn stand out isn’t just the individual ingredients—it’s how they work synergistically. Together, these components create a metabolic domino effect. The formula activates thermogenesis, your body’s natural ability to burn calories for heat, which accelerates fat loss. It also optimizes nutrient absorption and energy utilization, ensuring your body uses every calorie to its fullest potential.

**Backed by Science, Built for Results**

The beauty of this formula lies in its simplicity and transparency. It’s not about overwhelming your system with stimulants or unnatural chemicals. Instead, it works with your body’s natural processes, enhancing what’s already there. Each ingredient has been studied extensively for its effectiveness, ensuring a safe, reliable solution for anyone looking to elevate their health and fitness journey.

**My Final Thoughts on the Science**

After digging into the research, it became crystal clear why I felt such a profound shift in my energy and weight management. The blend is a masterclass in natural, science-backed nutrition. It’s not just another supplement; it’s a tool to unlock the potential already within you.

So, whether you’re a busy professional, a parent on the go, or someone who’s tired of fighting the same uphill battle with weight and energy, this could be your game-changer.

**What is Java Burn, and how does it work?**

Java Burn is a natural, tasteless dietary supplement that you mix into your coffee. It works by boosting your metabolism, increasing fat-burning, and enhancing your energy levels without altering the taste of your favorite brew. The formula contains a blend of scientifically backed ingredients like green tea extract, green coffee bean extract, and L-Carnitine to support weight loss and overall health.

**Can I use Java Burn with any type of coffee?**

Yes, Java Burn is designed to mix seamlessly with any type of coffee, whether it’s black, sweetened, decaf, or even iced. It’s tasteless and dissolves quickly, making it compatible with your personal coffee preferences.

**Is Java Burn safe to use?**

Absolutely. Java Burn is manufactured in an FDA-approved facility, adhering to Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) standards. The ingredients are 100% natural, non-GMO, gluten-free, and free of artificial additives. However, if you have underlying health conditions or are taking medications, it’s always a good idea to consult your healthcare provider before starting any new supplement.

**How soon can I see results?**

Many users notice increased energy and reduced appetite within the first few days. For visible weight loss results, consistency is key. Most people report significant changes within 4–6 weeks when used daily as part of their routine.

1hr6z4k,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1hr6z4k/vertuo_machine_that_is_rarely_used_not_working/,Vertuo machine that is rarely used not working,"My wife got a Nespresso machine as a wedding gift. She was beyond pumped. However, 2.5 years with it and she rarely touches it. Frankly, it drives me nuts. She claims the coffee doesn’t come out hot enough and she just gave up on it. She only uses it to serve guests ever so often. However, about a year ago the machine stopped brewing (orange light).

We bought the descaling solution about 6 months ago and, after countless descaling runs, the machine began working again. She’s literally made like two coffees in it since we did this. Now, we have guests coming over so she ran a test coffee and sure enough it’s not working again. Same orange light.

My hypothesis is that she doesn’t use the machine and as a result it has built up scale in the machine. She claims it’s a faulty machine. 

Does anyone have any troubleshooting solutions or experience with sparsely used machines?",1,1735750810.0,nespresso,3,1.0,False
1hr6yhf,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1hr6yhf/ugh_help_me_analyze_this_text_convo_kind_of_a_rant/,UGH HELP ME ANALYZE THIS TEXT CONVO 😖 (kind of a rant),"Basically, there's this guy \[M 19\]. And I \[M 19\] like him a lot. But he also does *not* reply quickly. Like, the average response time is anywhere from 2-4 hours. And I think I could live with that if the responses I was getting back were substantive, but they're kinda all just snaps w/o words.

Now, in total fairness to him, his screen time is \~2 hours per day. But at the same time Snap for some reason says he's always online, and *sometimes* his snap score goes up and up while I'm left on delivered (and I'm not saying he should text his friends less—it's good that he has people to talk to—but it would be nice if he could just send me a text when he got a minute). 

I scheduled a face time with him (which felt weird, but I didn't want to call at a bad time), but he ended up running 40 minutes late. We've actually never called over the phone, which bugs me, but that's another matter entirely. I'm now giving him the space to ask about rescheduling. If he's interested in calling, he will, and if he's not, then oh well.

In person, things are all right. He's still *really* bad at being in contact irl (I don't think we've ever just texted back and forth), but in person, he's really sweet and thoughtful. He's *so* cute, and the sex is honestly really good. We met during finals season, so I told myself that he was probably just busy with preparing for that. But things really haven't gotten better over break.

My friends think I should leave, but that's kinda not the answer I want to hear. I just want to open up communication. But I also want him to want to communicate. I thought if I gave him a bit of time he would naturally take some initiative, but that doesn't seem to be the case. Basically, I don't want him to feel like this not-relationship is a chore, but it would be *so nice* if he called like once or twice a week for half an hour. Honestly, it would make me the happiest boy in the world. 

But anyway, without further ado, here's what I texted after we couldn't FaceTime. Please help me know what I should be taking away from this/if I broached it wrong. 

Me:

Also, here's the part where I go over some of the things I was going to say verbally.

Basically, I like you, like a lot. And it's weird, and this is kinda new for me, and I'm trying to do everything right. I'm trying to check off all the important boxes. And it would make me feel infinitely better if I could just make sure we're on the same page w/ some of these things.

1. Are we boyfriends? Should I tell people that, or not tell people anything, or should I say this is a situationship or what
2. I get not being super into texting, and this might not make a lot of sense (I'll workshop it), but like, I want to know what you're thinking. And it just confuses me a little bit when the fastest I'm going to get a response is like four hours. Like, if you feel like I'm coming on too strongly when I reply quickly, just let me know and I can be more...idk judicious with my responses. But I kind of like being able to go back and forth with people, either over phone or text or really fast carrier pigeon And 3.) I want you to live your life. I don't want you to have to restructure your calendar to fit me in it.

Oh and 4.) If it wasn't already readily apparent, I'm kinda a little insecure, and I don't love admitting that. But I also can't read minds, and if there's ever something your thinking, you should just say it bc otherwise the odds are not in your favor that I'll be able to guess it right.

And I should have said this sooner, but I was telling myself that if I was this explicit you'd take it the wrong way-l'm just the type of person that needs things to be clearly delineated and defined (I have a very poor sense of subtlety)

  
Him:

hey thank you for like reaching out about you 

I think like continuing the convo had that time we got coffee like after Thanksgiving, from my POV idk what I'm really looking for rn if that's a relationship or not I don't know — I think we should talk when we get back cuz I wanna hear your perspective cuz that's important to me what you're thinking

I really like seeing you and talking and spending time and I definitely want to continue with that - having never done this before, l'd think it's best to go into this with no explicit expectations of say, a relationship or not, and see where this evolves naturally (again I wanna see you when we get back and we should have this convo irl)

also like plz don't worry about like replying too quickly - I admit that I'm a bit of a lethargic communicator when it's over snap or text or email or whatever... so I hope that didn't like come off in any way or another I'm just slow

Also from my own knowledge of myself I can sometimes not be the bestest communicator for stuff (esp if it's like emotions and related topics) so I'll make sure to make an active effort:)",1,1735750762.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False
1hr6yfd,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1hr6yfd/spent_new_years_eve_all_alone_because_i_dont_have/,Spent new years eve all alone because I don't have a friend group. ,"While most people were out having a great time, I spent New Year's Eve all alone at home. Not a single one of my ""friends"" invited me to hang out or go to any parties with them. In fact, I've never been invited to any New Years or Christmas parties ever. And I'm so tired of feeling left out. 

I would consider myself a fairly attractive guy - I'm 28 years old, over 6 ft tall, I work out, and I get 2-4 matches per day on dating apps. But I've never had a core friend group. I have individual friends who I'll catch up with 1 on 1, but I'm not a part of their friend groups, and I don't have a main friend group of my own. So they'll meet with me for drinks or a coffee from time to time, but they'll spend most of their social time with their own friend groups which I'm not a part of. For as far back as I can remember, I've craved the idea of having a group of 3 or 4 really good friends who I could regularly hang out with, go on trips and make memories with, and who would have my back just like I'd have theirs. It seems like such a normal thing that most people take for granted. But the older I get, the more I realize that I might never get to experience this.
  
I'm an extremely loyal person by nature. I go out of my way to help people, even if they don't ask for it. But they never do the same for me. For example, one of my so-called friends recently asked me if I could give him some tips for an upcoming job interview, since I have pretty good interview skills. I took time out of my day to get on a call with him and spent almost 3 hours walking him through interview techniques and giving him various tips that helped me land a job. The next day, after the interview was over, he didn't even bother texting me to let me know how it went. He wouldn't have even said anything if I hadn't followed up to ask. Situations like these just make me feel like my ""friends"" only reach out if they need something, yet they're never here for me in the same way when I need them. 

I'm also always the one reaching out to initiate plans. If I don't reach out and ask to catch up, my friends almost never invite me to things or suggest that we hang out. It makes me feel so invisible and unwanted, even though I know that I'm desirable because I have a pretty active dating life and have no trouble getting attention from women. But when it comes to friendships, for whatever reason I always feel like the kid who gets picked last in gym class, no matter what I do. 

In 2024, I went out of my way to try to make new friends and be adopted by a friend group. I went to a bunch of social events where I didn't know anyone, and I even attended some open mic nights and sang in front of complete strangers just to try and make new friends. I did meet some new people who invited me to hang out with them, but they were all part of a group who'd known each other for 10+ years and were BFFs, and I felt like the odd one out. I did join a couple of their hangouts, but I always felt like an outsider. They had their own group chat which I wasn't a part of (understandable because they'd known each other since freshman year of college), and even though I tried to keep the friendship going, eventually we just faded out of contact. And when I texted one of them again after a while of not seeing each other, I was ghosted and left on delivered. I'm an introvert by nature but I really spent so much time in 2024 trying to make new friends. Yet, here I am on the first day of 2025, no closer to my goal than I was last year.

I know I'm a good person, and I always go the extra mile for my friends (or the people who I like to think are my friends). But I've never even so much as been invited to a new year's party before. Leading up to this New Year's  all I wanted was to finally know what it was like to be included in something. To be invited to a new year's party and get to celebrate the new year with people who weren't my parents or relatives. But not a single person reached out to invite me to anything. I tried suggesting to my individual friends that we do something for new years when I saw them 1 on 1 in December, and they all said ""yeah sounds good!"" and then went on to plan their own parties with their own friend groups. And once again I was left out. I'm going to be 30 in 2 years, and I've never experienced what it's like to have a best friend or a group of best friends. I'm just so sick and fed up of seeing everyone on social media posting all these pictures with their friend groups for new years, and meanwhile I didn't even have a single person to celebrate it with. I just feel so tired of this constant loneliness and rejection. Thank you for reading this extremely long winded and unnecessary rant :)",1,1735750758.0,rant,0,1.0,False

We stroke up a conversation with her about a type of cookie that I know how to make m. She said she would “literally pay me” to bring in homemade cookies so she could try them.  with Since then, they’ve gone out 6 times but 4 of them were nice dates in which food was involved. Every time he’s told me about the date, I’ve asked him what each of them ate (ex: they went out for drinks and apps - what did you order?) and every time he tells me she said she ate before they went out. I made a comment that I think it’s a little weird she hasn’t eaten anything while they went out. He planned a date around dinner and another activity and she didn’t eat. She said she ate before. He got super defensive and said she’s going to school for nutrition, so she eats healthy. I have considered that maybe she has a sensitive stomach and chooses to not eat out in case her stomach hurts. Their most recent date, they spent HOURS together and even went to the gym. They went to get coffee and breakfast burritos after the gym and she still did not eat. I baked some of the cookies we talked about when we met her, so I sent them with my brother in law to give to her when he saw her. When I saw him the next day of course I asked if she liked them, but he said she didn’t try them when they were together. Two days go by and I tell him I’m kind of annoyed I haven’t heard anything about the cookies. He said she did try them and she had a reaction to them so she didn’t eat them. Apparently, she gets a reaction to the ones at the bakery too. They’re an almond based cookie. Why would she say she has no food allergies, but then is suddenly allergic to almonds? She told him it’s because it’s almond paste… but my recipe doesn’t actually use paste. I use an almond filling. So… she would have to be allergic to almonds… I just think it’s suspicious. My brother freaked out on me when I pointed out that I think it’s a little concerning she didn’t eat again and suddenly she’s allergic to the cookies she told me she’d pay me to make. He told me he doesn’t want to hear about it again and it’s none of my business, which he is right about, but I find it more of a concern for him to blindly fall for someone and refuse to see any potential red flags. Him doing that is a bigger red flag to me than her having a bad relationship with food.

I work in the field of functional medicine and know many, many people who are cautious about food or follow specific diets and I am one of those myself. One of the reasons he liked this girl on their first date is because she said she eats everything and has no food allergies. I have food sensitivities and follow a certain diet for health reasons and my brother gets annoyed by my “healthy” modifications to baking. I’m cautious of ingredients and quality of food, but that doesn’t stop me from eating especially out on a date. If she has some form of disordered eating, I’m not telling him that’s a reason to not go out with her. I’m just telling him it’s a little odd and maybe something should pay attention to. Am i overreacting?

I went to a bunch of social events where I didn't know anyone, and I even attended some open mic nights and sang in front of complete strangers just to try and make new friends. I did meet some new people who invited me to hang out with them, but they were all part of a group who'd known each other for 10+ years and were BFFs, and I felt like the odd one out. I did join a couple of their hangouts, but I always felt like an outsider. They had their own group chat which I wasn't a part of (understandable because they'd known each other since freshman year of college), and even though I tried to keep the friendship going, eventually we just faded out of contact. And when I texted one of them again after a while of not seeing each other, I was ghosted and left on delivered. I'm an introvert by nature but I really spent so much time in 2024 trying to make new friends. Yet, here I am on the first day of 2025, no closer to my goal than I was last year.

I know I'm a good person, and I always go the extra mile for my friends (or the people who I like to think are my friends). But I've never even so much as been invited to a new year's party before. Leading up to this New Year's  all I wanted was to finally know what it was like to be included in something. To be invited to a new year's party and get to celebrate the new year with people who weren't my parents or relatives. But not a single person reached out to invite me to anything. I tried suggesting to my individual friends that we do something for new years when I saw them 1 on 1 in December, and they all said ""yeah sounds good!"" and then went on to plan their own parties with their own friend groups. And once again I was left out. I'm going to be 30 in 2 years, and I've never experienced what it's like to have a best friend or a group of best friends. I'm just so sick and fed up of seeing everyone on social media posting all these pictures with their friend groups for new years, and meanwhile I didn't even have a single person to celebrate it with. I just feel so tired of this constant loneliness and rejection. Thank you for reading this extremely long winded and unnecessary rant :)",2,1735750657.0,lonely,0,1.0,False

1hr6vn4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1hr6vn4/sad_on_new_years/,Sad on new years.,"Waking up this morning to seeing all of my friends partying and having fun and I have FOMO. It’s stupid to be feeling this way, I turn 24 in a month and I really should be a bigger person than I am and not feel stupid stuff like this. I have a child and a fiancé, and we’re really a happy family, but it’s just different not having any real friends. I moved across the country to live close to my fiancé’s family when we started our family. Im still connected with my old friends, we play games every once in a while, I text them every few days, send memes every day. It’s not that I feel they don’t love me anymore, it’s just that being so far from them makes me lonely.

I moved 3 years ago. I haven’t really made any new friends where we live now. I have a few coworker friends, where we have fun at work and occasionally get together outside of work usually for holidays (like friendsgiving). I have a child and I’m young so not many other folks have kids so I understand there’s a natural disconnect because of that. No one wants to invite the engaged parent friend out to have fun because they assume that they’re just busy with family. And I guess usually I am, or I’m often too tired, but I have gone out a handful of times with them. When I do I try really hard to connect with new people, get their socials and have conversation. It’s not like I just sit alone and don’t talk to anyone, I do genuinely make an effort. And I’ll think I’m doing good, because people will say things like I’m so funny or I’m so cool. But actually being friends with people doesn’t seem to stick and I don’t know why. Maybe I’m just too weird, or people are naturally inclined to not want to connect with me because I have a child and they don’t. I don’t know.

My initial new year’s resolution was to make more friends. I’m tired of feeling lonely. I love my fiancé and my daughter, but there’s a hole in my heart where I want a friend I can hang out with. I just can’t seem to find anyone I connect with well enough that they want to be my friend. I really do open up to people and do my best to connect with them, and I feel like I do with many, but clearly not enough for them to want to be friends. 

I don’t really have any of my own family. Most people have siblings or cousins they can connect with. I really just have my mom and my grandparents. It makes me feel a bit old. My mom is my best friend, which isn’t a bad thing, we play video games together and call almost every day. But she’s chronically ill and suffers a lot, so when we talk it’s often fairly sad and usually about her suffering. Playing games with her is fun and doesn’t end up being about her pain, but she is also across the country so I can’t see her in person.

I just feel very lonely. I love my fiancé more than anything but he works night shifts and I work day shifts, so we only really get one day off together on the weekend and the rest of that is a 2-5hr period where we’ll watch a show and cuddle or just hang out with our daughter. We don’t go out to do anything ever, usually because we’re both too tired or because we don’t have anyone to watch our daughter. The most we “go out” is going grocery shopping as a family. 

I feel bad for wanting a friend when I have my daughter and fiancé, I shouldn’t feel lonely because I have them. But I do. I feel so lonely all the time. Talking to my friends who live so far away sometimes helps, but other times it makes me feel more lonely because they’re so far away and I’m not really a part of their lives anymore. I’m just tired of feeling this way.

My new year’s resolution was to make more friends but I just feel defeated. I put myself out there but I guess everyone already has their friends and isn’t looking for new ones or something. Maybe it really is just because I have a family people assume I don’t want new friends or something. I don’t know. I’m feeling really bad about it. I’m almost 24 and can’t make any real friends. I just feel lonely and sad all the time. When my fiancé and I get married, I can’t even think of more than 4 people I’d be able to invite to the wedding, and all of those people live far away from us. 

My fiancé doesn’t have many friends but that doesn’t seem to bother him. He’s always been a very secluded and quiet person. He’s okay with his own space and just having me and our daughter. I don’t know how he does it. I feel terrible about not having a friend I can just get lunch or coffee with or something. And I don’t know how to fix it because I’ve done everything I can to put myself out there, be open to new people, try to connect with them. I feel like I’ve done a good job too, but none of the people I’ve met actually really want to be friends. And that’s okay, I’m not saying they have to. I’m just sad I haven’t found someone to connect with like that.",2,1735750539.0,Vent,0,1.0,False

If you really study it well, you'll find that only a handful of foods are off the limits, like spinach, beets, rhubarb, almonds, hazelnuts, dark chocolate, etc.

For potatoes: https://www.plantzmatter.com/post/oxalate-levels-in-potatoes

This shows you can still eat red peeled boiled potatoes, as well as fries made with red blanched peeled potatoes, puree, etc.

Also shown that oranges are high in oxalate, but not orange juice (I guess it's because the oxalate is mostly in the white stuff). Same for tomato vs tomato juice.

Dark chocolate is off the charts, but not milk chocolate, with almost no oxalate, since the cocoa content is much lower, being mostly cocoa butter (I think), which has no oxalate.
 
Many nuts are low oxalate, such as pecan, macadamia and pistachio. As well as many vegetables. So it's far from truth that you have to give up all nuts and vegetables. 

Most beans are low oxalate. Coffee and tea are low oxalate (yes, because even though tea leaves are very high in oxalate, only 1-2 grams are used for each cup, leading to around 10mg per cup).

Simply find out which foods are high and limit oxalate to 50mg a day. And there you have it, a low oxalate diet with very few food restrictions.

90% of all stones are made of calcium oxalate, so it goes without saying that pretty much all stone formers (in my opinion even everyone, really, but that's me) should be on a low oxalate diet for life. There would be no logistic obstacles to it, because whatever we choose not to eat we can simply not cultivate, or cultivate less, and use the land for other things. Unless you had to go carnivore to go low oxalate, which is far from truth. Plenty of plant foods have almost no oxalate.",3,1735750466.0,KidneyStones,2,1.0,False

I recently upgraded to a Niche Zero grinder, and the improvement in espresso texture and taste was instantly noticeable.

For fun, I decided to dust off my old Mr. Coffee cafe barista, which I used before the Breville. I was frankly shocked by the excellent shot quality when using the Niche Zero on such a cheap machine ($120 in 2017 I think?). I used to think the whole ‘grinder matters more than the machine’ talk was overhyped, but now I’m a firm believer. If you’re starting out on a budget, truly invest in a high-quality grinder and pair it with a cheap machine. You’ll almost certainly get far better coffee than with a fancy machine and a average or below average grinder.

Sidenote- these beans were a bit too fresh at only 2 days off roast, so I’ll be giving the Mr. Coffee another spin in a few days and plan to do a direct taste comparison with the Breville. Cheers!",51,1735750318.0,espresso,11,1.0,False

They help me get through stuff. I know that the title might seem bad but I felt my actions are somewhat justified. 

I (F 19) am part of friend group in college with Martha (F 20), Grace (F 19), Adam (M 19), and Steve (M 19). We always love to hangout, and as new college students we were able to quickly form a group. Martha is a new addition to the group because she is a mutual friend of Grace from a sorority. I talked to Martha 3 times before I reveled Adam about Martha's feelings because secretly I liked Adam too for couple of months. 

The first ever interaction with Martha was through Grace after a class where we were talking about some friendship problems Martha was going through. I felt bad for her because she was being left out so I invited to other things we were doing the next day. The next day, we all arrived to the event early except for Adam. During this second interaction, Martha was talking about how much she was hanging out with Adam for a few days and how they gotten closer. I kinda got mad and a little jealous. But some of her behavior sounded a little weird. For example, she was faking to be weak to open her water bottle so he can open it. Next, she said she wanted a ride to the airport and she said she wanted to ask Adam. I quickly jumped in and said Adam was busy (which was not a lie as he told me about it before). So Grace said she would be glad to drive her to the airport. Right after the conversation was over Adam arrived but Martha left because she was too shy to hang out with him with us which I thought was weird cause she was comfortable hanging out with him one on one. 

The third and final interaction is where my world view of Martha completely shifted. We all had lunch as a group but I left the lunch early to work on something. I was sitting outside the coffee shop in uni and Adam saw me so decided to sit with me. We talked for a while and low-key he was being really playful so I decided to give him back the same energy. But after a while he said he wanted to go back to him dorm. So I was like was ok and sat there to continue to do my work. After a while, Martha and Grace saw me and they sat with me. So I decided to ask Martha if she wanted to date Adam seriously and she said she wanted to have a fling with Adam before dating another boy. Ngl that kinda pissed me off because she want to mess around for fun. 

A bit of context, Adam told me before that he wanted to date to marry but he was in a place in life where he didn't want to date. He was telling me about his preferences and she didn't fit some of them (like he wants date somebody younger).

Anyways, I told the girls that I was just talking to Adam before they sat with me. So Martha told me to call him over and I was like fine let's do that, and so I did. So I texted him Martha, Grace and I are out here and if he wanted to come sit with us and he said he will to be there. After he was there, Martha did a 180 and changed her personality and Adam seemed detached from the situation because he wasn't talking to her. Girl when I tell your her voice changed, and her mannerisms gotten so touchy (pick meish). Anyways she was talking about dress shopping for a danc and wanted to go to it with a date (very subtly asking him out). Adam was visibly looked very uninterested because he didn't want to talk about dress shopping.

Little bit about Adam is that he is a little conservative and loves politics. Personally, I told him I was liberal and he said it's fine and he loves to listen to talk about my views. Politics is how me and him gotten close. 

Because Adam was uncomfortable I changed the subject about the recent presidential election and he was explaining me some stuff about it. I love when he mansplains ahhhh. Martha feeling left out, said something out of the blue and I couldn't believe she said it. She loudly sighs and says ""Bruh don't you like to yap. Personally I don't think women should have a right to vote. They belong in the kitchen and have to serve the man. Woman  shouldn't get a college degree period. They shouldn't be talking about politics like you"" I almost slapped this ho because WTF.  All my friends visibly gasped. I was taken a back, but I revived and went off on this b. I said how can she say it as a woman and started to argue with her. Adam backed me up as said women should vote in this part of history. Grace was mad too and argued with her. Martha said that she knows about her woman rights history and how bad it was like. I got mad again and said if she believed women can't go to college why is she here. No response. Legit I left my stuff and walked off and Adam tried to get a hold of me but I was like whatever. I took a walk and came back sat down because I didn't want to be mean. Then she proceeds to ask Adam to open her water bottle and I glared at this man. He said not now maybe later. As we were walking our ways I walked, Martha texts me and says that she said those things because she wanted Adam’s attention and I said whatever but what she did was a little pick me. Few hours later, Martha makes a group chat with me and Grace. All she talked about was Adam and how they are perfect couple. I said he didn't want to date because he genuinely doesn't. But Grace was affirming her delusions and told me to stop talking. This group chat got me mad and told myself this crap should end in the now. 

Next day, I saw Adam sitting alone eating lunch so I sat with him and talked a little with him about life in general. One thing I asked him was whether he was oblivious or likes playing dumb. He said he was observant and knows what happens around him. Then I asked if he noticed Martha's actions and he said he did. I said Martha wanted to date him. In response he asked if I told her that he doesn't want to date anyone and that she didn't fit his preferences and I said I did. Now here I was irrational because I showed him the groupchat and funny thing was Steve sat down while I was reading the group chat loudly. Adam was both confused but amused that he was getting the attention.

Later that night, all of us had dinner and this point I felt nauseous because some much went behind Martha's back and I felt bad. I was stopping my tears because its I felt like an opp. So back to the story, Martha was talking about the dance again. Now this time she asked him if he had a date. He said no. Being bold she said she wanted to go with him. Instead of saying no he said ""you can go with Grace."" I kicked him under the table and mouthed stop. This caused Adam to be quiet the rest of the dinner. I felt like I was responsible for this and cried when I got back to my dorm.

The next day when Grace and I saw Adam he said he invited Martha to the coffee shop and said he genuinely doesn't want to date her. Grace was confused and I was like oh God, and then he looked at me and winked. 

Martha was livid and unhappy and she started sending us images of her crying. Even though this happened weeks ago, Martha doesn't know I said anything and how we were able to become good friends now that she doesn't like Adam. I cried in front of Steve and told him and he said I wasn't the A Hole. So tell me what I need to do now.

Update: Martha is dating another man. Adam is being really flirty and we are hanging out every day but don't I want to be direct with him because of fear of rejection. Grace now has a bf and told me she hates Martha.

I (M53) met a Suzie (F51) on a dating app in September 2024.   

We immediately hit it off and the relationship pretty heavy pretty quickly.   We've gone on trips together and see each other almost every weekend.  We've spent quite a few nights together and the sex is the most amazing I've had in a very long time.  

Suzie, however, has recently went through a huge tragedy.  Her child (early 20s) passed away in late March 2024.  She was the one who found the body, too.  

I cannot imagine the pain and anguish she is going through.  There are many times that we are together that (seemingly out of the blue), she will just break down and cry, lamenting over her child.   I have tried very hard to be supportive of her and just listen and let her cry when this happens.  

Where I'm struggling is that her pain is negatively affecting me.   I certainly don't want to sound like an asshole, but I sometimes feel ignored.   

Yesterday was New Years Eve.   She did not want to see me or go out, as she said she wanted to lay in bed and think about her lost child and cry as this is her first NYE after the death.     So, I ushered in the New Year alone.  We texted a little, but her responses were slow (and all about her child).   Her last text was around 9PM.  

I woke up this morning, got dressed, made coffee, and read my emails.   Around 8AM, I texted her good morning and happy new year.    It's now almost 11AM and she has not responded at all.    

  
Is it important that I spend NYE with her?  A little... but I can understand and be supportive.  But this happened over Thanksgiving and Christmas as well.  (Her excuses was always that it was her first xxxx without the child).   I'm truly dreading Valentines Day as thats just a few days away from her child's birthday.  

I feel like an ass because if feels (to me) like I'm trying to be in competition with a dead child.  I'm not saying she needs to get over it, but I don't want to spend every holiday alone.   I've talked to her about going to therapy, but only superficially as I feel the relationship is too young for me to make suggestions like that.  But, she has repeatedly said that she's not ready for therapy.  

Again, I have NO idea the pain she's going through.  I've never lost a child (Thank God!).   

So, I'm here, looking for thoughts and advice. ",1,1735749935.0,relationshipadvice,1,1.0,False

I get a barely tan water that vaguely smells like a hint of coffee and tastes like burnt water.  I clean and descale the machine regularly on the recommended schedule.

I have looked at various troubleshooting guides and found nothing useful.  Any ideas?",1,1735749912.0,superautomatic,5,1.0,False

I've gathered a lot of portable electronics: table lamp, coffee grinder, electric shaver, various bike equipment, etc.  I love having these be rechargeable so I don't have to worry about cords.  But I hate taking them to a charger to refresh them -- not only are they out of service until recharging, but there's no convenient place for everything to charge.

Instead, use old battery packs and take them to the appliance.  You can plug them in and use them, then leave the pack until it's charged up.  Much easier to find a place to charge and store a few battery packs than to keep moving the appliances around",0,1735749890.0,LifeProTips,8,0.17,False
1hr6mt0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeRoasting/comments/1hr6mt0/kaleido_m2_smoke_kit/,Kaleido M2 smoke kit?,"Happy New Year! I'm moving from my Ikawa home roaster to a Kaleido M2. I'm unsure how much the unit smokes, but with the Ikawa, I could roast under my oven fan. I'm not sure this will be possible with 300g of coffee. If smoke is an issue, does anyone know of simple kits that would allow me to use my kitchen overhead fan with the roaster? I appreciate the help; I've tried searching for a solution without any luck.

Small, incremental changes add up. Start low, go slow. And be mindful of where your resistance is. Don't want to clean or put order in the place because it's such a huge task? Set the goal to do 5 or 10 minutes a day. Or maybe 10 in the morning, 10 in the evening. Right? ... Right.

...*<sips coffee>*... Ahhh.... 2025 starts good with a coffee tasting this good. ...*<looks at you>*... See what works. Stay mindful; which things bring you joy, and which make you feel *ehhh*? Are there expectations you put on yourself that are outdated, or maybe they're not even *your* expectations, but they belong to the people you grew up around.

Remember to look at your *want* instead of your *should*. ""I should eat healthier"", ""I should move more"", ""I should this or that"" -- those are guilt-tripping phrases. And such a shitty motivation to do something!

What is that you *want* from those things? What's the end goal? What would you like? ""I would like to feel less out of breath when taking the stairs"", ""I would love to read more"", ""I would really like it to spend more time with or on...."" -- you see the difference? You *feel* the difference?

Anyway....enough of that. Dad could ramble on for hours like that, and I'm sure you have other things to do as well.

1. Cozy coffee shop where we can chill and do some planning. Preferably a spot with a fireplace.
2. Ramen spot with a good atmosphere?
3. Recommendations for places to see local art and/or interesting vintage shops
4. Peaceful hiking/nature exploration, if the weather permits

I have for some months problems with peeing generally too often, not only during the day but lately also during the night - I wake up at least once to go to pee. Before 10-11AM I go to pee at least 4-5 times. And I pee a lot. I always thought that it is because I drink too much coffee during the day. But my mom drinks even more and she doesn’t pee that often. 

I did some tests and the following came out:

Cholesterol 201 (max 200).
Albumin in urine 56.80 (max 20 mg/l)
Albumin / Krea Ratio 50.7 (max max 30 mg/g)

All other results are in the green area. No indication about pre-diabetes or diabetes. 

I never had problems with too high cholesterol. Neither with Albumin. To mention that Albumin level 6 months ago was above the limit but still the half of the today’s value (round 25 mg/l). 

Urlologist said that I have a bit a thickened bladder wall and gave me some pills to reduce the urinary frequency. He sent me to nephrologist. 

The nephrologist said that I am healthy, my kidney and everything is fine and gave me some pills to lower the albumin level in the urine. 

They all try to treat the sympthoms but which is the cause?

I was also taking long time different medicine for depression etc. and I am thinking that this might have affected something. I am still taking now 75mg Venlafaxine. I took a long time (like 2 years) lots of other medicine such as Zyprexa, Gabapentine, Sertraline, Rivotril, Zoloft. Or maybe the supplements I was taking could have caused the albumin in urine and the frequent urination? (Omega 3, Coenzime Q10, some homeopatic stuff).

Hi! I’m Stephanie. I’m 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection, something close to a relationship. I’d like to find someone I can confide in, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older. Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don’t have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I am single, and would prefer that you are as well. I’m not looking to change my situation at this time, but do crave a relationship-like connection. I’m not interested in anything solely or immediately nsfw in nature, I prefer to know a person quite well before that. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health

That’s just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interest you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started! Chats preferred over messages.

And, theres a girl Ive known for years who’s done that with me. The way our friendship started was definitely by romantic interest. But shes 3 years younger than me and the timing was just weird because I was about to graduate High school and well… she wasn’t. I had my opportunity but it felt like I was taking advantage and it just didnt sit right with, farthest we gone was kind of awkwardly cuddling?But now we’ve gone to college together even had the same class, and we have the same friend group. Her and I are pretty similar to say the least from interests, hobbies, career path and even down to the small things like the kind of music and alcohol we drink. This isn’t because we’ve rubbed off on one another either; we’re good friends but more “occasionally” see each other.

Shes honestly beautiful and just my type and I feel like she has to be attracted to me… theres just moments you know? There were times ive noticed jealousy from her and shit even I have caught myself being jealous at a few points but I kind of just now am realizing everything… The thing is, theres just never a good time it seems for us. Whenever I maybe felt a spark I was either seeing someone else or she was. Or life whatever it may be. But now were both single so recently about a month and a half ago I had the thought of just asking her out after hanging out with her and her friend. Originally they were trying to hook me up with her but she was no where near my type… but she said something that night that snowballed all these thoughts into my brain. So respectfully and carefully I kind of asked her out to a coffee date.. well I got seemingly friend zoned. And, from there I thought I just misread the situation and kind of just continued on with my life since than.

But I recently saw her again and I even gave her a bday gift. She always gets me something for mine so I got her a plant. She likes plants. I know nothing about plants. And, I was kind of curious to see what it looked like. So I asked her ( over text ). And, this became an entire joke conversation where we were kind of just role playing like we were in relationship and phil (plant) was our kid? Idk man it was goofy im all with the goofs. And, if anyones seen the movie Shutter Island well I kind of pulled that on her. Just kind of saying “i dont want to see phil ever again, we’re not even dating. Its all in your head”. It wasn’t exactly that but just know it was all friendly. But anyways she didn’t get the shutter island plot twist, so I kind of mentioned like “now we have to watch shutter island”  and she didn’t reply right away. Keep in mind this was on NYE and unfortunately I couldn’t go out with all of my friends last night. But she did end up replying  around 3am just saying “we shall”. Idk wtf that means tbh, idk if its bait or a joke. Or if she was just drunk. And, yes im a bit anxious about this but thanks guys thats the story advice would be pretty nice rn.",1,1735749540.0,dating_advice,5,1.0,False
1hr6ip7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlAnon/comments/1hr6ip7/in_need_of_advice/,In need of advice,"Hi everyone,

I (F31) just ended a 9 year relationship with my boyfriend (M37) - an addict in recovery. He has been sober for 11 months, but his emotional immaturity really made it hard for me to keep coping. He gets angry for really small things since his sobriety (for example : being extremely angry when making a joke with a mutual friend that he always wants to leave very early when we need to go somewhere).

I believe it has to do with his low self esteem that is coming to the surface. He acknowledges this too, but still he feels that I don't understand him. The last time he was very upset when he made coffee for everyone on a trip with friends, and the last day of the trip a friend asked if we bought the coffee ourselves or if he got it from the cupboards in the appartment. He told her he found the coffee in the cupboards, which she replied to that they never take anything from the cupboards (appartment rented from a family friend). He took this very personal and was so upset and angry about it. It took an hour or longer for him to feel okay-ish again and act normal.

Afterwards my friend told me she and her BF felt like they had to walk on eggshells the whole time and she never knew this side of him. She found it 'admirable' how I could deal with this behaviour on a regular basis.

I tried to talk to him about it because I felt his reaction was unfair and disproportional towards our friends, but he felt as if I was worried more about our friends feelings than his feelings. He though I should just support him no matter what.

Eventually I gathered all my courage and asked him to start relationship therapy, but again he felt very attacked (""I worked so hard on myself this year, you want perfection,...""). Afterwards he calmed down and told me he was okay with starting therapy. But something in me already snapped. I just felt so tired and left our house the next day. Initially to find some peace for myself, but I just did not want to go back home to him. So after two weeks at my dad's house I broke up with him.

It's been a couple of weeks now and he really hopes that I change my mind and give our relationship another shot. He says he wants to grow old with me. He believes we can work on it together, but I feel like I can't fix his low self esteem issues and it is affecting my happiness and my mental wellbeing (I feel small in the relationship and I constantly adjust myself so I don't make it harder for him being in sobriety).

I don't know if I am making a big mistake by ending things now that he is sober and trying to work on himself?

I do feel like I have codependency tendencies. I am realising that I fall for men who are struggling with addiction and  I adjust to this 'saviour' role. I'm scared we can never get out of this pattern after 9 years and that I can only develop a healthy relationship when I have done some serious soul searching.

What do you think? 

Thanks for taking the time to read!

1hr6imb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hr6imb,A comprehensive review of new house,"Citrus dive  - Best summer vacation fragrance - I have tried many LV afterswim DNA but didn't liked any because of linear scent profile, but this has neroli in mid and base which makes it more interesting and standout bit more, it's best for summers, No alcohol blast gives it extra premium feel to it, and lasting is amazing for freshie upto 6hr with decent projection but with maceration it becomes even better. 


Aftermath - A unique, must have date night fragrance - I have tried the original (initio side effect) in maisons des parfum delhi and can say it's 90% similar( OG is less sweet) it's a must have for winters, very interesting scent profile. Again it gives 0 alcohol blast, it's a must have for winters date night. I'll suggest it only for night times on winter/colder days it might be clawing in heat( just like og). I haven't tested it's lasting because it's date night frag (I deliberately don't want it to last long, but it does last really long) can get whiff from clothes even next night.


Mocha manic - my favourite from aromacraft - mocha manic is my first sniff love and bought the tester itself while testing it was his literally first bottle(mind you I'm very cautious type guy in buying frag) it's has gourmand profile, opening bitter coffee ( it might be bothersome if you don't like americano or expresso shots) with vanilla as base I find its vanilla similar to lattafa nebras but more heavy. It might remind you of kopiko coffee. It's has more than a day of lasting in clothes.

Conclusion - all 3 are my favourite (depending on occasion) and my only regret is not buying 100ml of each. Aromacraft

1hr6gbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/afterlife/comments/1hr6gbg/constructing_a_defendable_case_for_nonmortal/,Constructing a (defendable) case for non-mortal consciousness.,"What can we actually deduce (or induce) about the possibility of nonmortal consciousness, starting (as we should) from known facts? Is it possible to deduce anything? Possibly. But starting from known facts is key, as it is the best insurance against the argument devolving into fantasy, wish fulfilment and Dunning Kruger territory, where (I regret to say) so much of the discussion on this subject languishes. 

Testrimony has its place, but testimony is not primary evidence, and should not be treated as such. One hundred people might be convinced that they’ve seen a dragon and therefore that dragons exist, but this is not a sound process of reasoning. Every one of those hundred can quite easily be mistaken about what they have seen (even if we assume they have seen it). Such testimony could be taken as a first step, a very weak kind of prima facie evidence for dragons, but that is all. We would then have to ask more probing questions about whether dragons could exist. For instance, could any throat tissue possibly exist that might survive the breathing of fire? Well, maybe. But there is the first instance of an actual question that has investigative merit. 

Well of course, we aren’t talking about dragons, but about the possibility of consciousness somehow being “bigger” or “more” than biological life. I’m not spedifically going to use the term “afterlife” because that already has a list of assumptions built in that we haven’t done any work to justify. 

 

We cannot account for the “emergence” of that which it is to be something, so the idea that some form of at least primitive awareness, or immediate potential for awareness, has ontological primacy is at least on some solid ground.There is no solid ground for saying that developed mind or specific entities of consciousness, including ourselves, have ontological primacy. However, it is not impossible to envision a cosmology in which that could be true. Each individual being could be like a unique “spoke” that originates from a core principle and is never repeated. I don’t see much actual evidence to interpret this as being the way things are, but as I say, in pure metaphysics, it is a viable speculation. 

 

On the other hand, every instance that we see of consciousness in context or in action is one associated with the space-time engine of the physical universe, and in the human context, the temporal engine of the brain. Known facts suggest that it is precisely this embedding of context that enables consciousness to “experience” things, to act creatively, to generate the new, and in general to have consequence in the ecology of being. 

If one could do all these things without the engine of change indicated by the space-time world and in the human case, by the brain, then common sense dictates that surely consciousness would already be doing this and the necessity of the physical world would be redundant, especially given its difficult, suffersome, and challenging natures. Again, all of the latter suggests that this engine of temporal change makes a real ontological difference to consciousness, and in a sense enables it to achieve things which otherwise are not possible at all. 

If it were possible to be individual, non-suffering, free, and pan-potentiated beings outside of the temporal engine, then we would assuredly already be those beings, and the physical world would not exist. 

One often sees the argument attempted that the physical world is for some “special project” or “lessons” or “diversions” from some apparently more real state of consciousness and action. But all of those speculations (and their cousins) suffer from the same problem. Why would existence be doing its “most real” or “most important” stuff anywhere except in its most capable theatre of action? That it would do otherwise makes no sense at all. As William James said, unless the suffersome world achieves something ontologically real, life is without measurable sense. Of course, maybe it IS without measurable sense, but we at least gain the possibility that it MIGHT have such sense. 

So if the physical world is the “capable theater of action” for consciousness, then life is the process by which change and creativity can occur. In other words, the action of consciousness needs temporal process. It is possible to imagine a phase of consciousness outside of this temporal process, but the nature of such consciousness, if it is there, would be greatly different from the nature of consciousness within the temporal engine (physical world) and we would enabled to conclude, with at least some confidence, that it cannot of itself oversee change, creativity, and development. 

This has an opposite side to its coin. If temporal process cannot occur outside of the physical context, then there cannot be “civilisations of incorporeal entities” existing somewhere, engaging in all kinds of activities and fond hobbies, evolving themselves, making discoveries... etc. All of these things just described are descriptions of beings within a temporal process. But as we have just seen, temporal process requires a highly developed engine of context, otherwise evolution is redundant, which would be an extremely malformed argument. 

There is zero evidence for other huge “engines of change and activity” within the ecology of being. Such is what a nonphysical world, filled with billions of acting and living beings, would literally have to be. But then you have the problem of explaining how this enormity could literally hide itself from all empirical investigatrion, and once again, we are up to our necks in implausibility. 

People sometimes argue that “absence of evidence is not evidence of absence” and to a degree this is true. For istance, the fact that I can’t find the coffee in my kitchen cupboard (absence of evidence) doesn’t prove that I haven’t mistakenly put it elsewhere and that I still have coffee nonetheless (evidence of absence). But this has its limits. For instance, is the fact that there is absence of evidence for a planet larger than Jupiter in our solar system really not evidence of absence? In fact, that is exactly what it is. Why? Because we know the parameters of gas giants and solar systems. There is literally nowhere for it to hide. 

Likewise, if there were a humanlike civilisation somewhere in our solar system, and if it had even minimal technology, or even if it didn’t, there would be nowhere for it to hide. Signal detection and/or unmanned probes would be destined to discover it, and they could not keep themselves concealed for long even if they made efforts to. 

In similar vein, notional nonphysical societies of beings are going to leave a footprint, and it will be large. Why? Because we would be talking about an engine of activity and change at least as large as the world if not larger. 

So again, with some confidence, based on true reasoning, we can say that any phase of consciousness which exists outside of the normal context of physicality, can’t have these properties, or we would have detected them by now. If you have to rely on conspiracy theory to object to this point, that is not a good place to be in. 

But if the world, and hence the temporal engine, is the “theatre of action” for consciousness, what is consciouness then when it is not inhabiting the theater of action?

The answer must surely be one or another version of the idea that it is latent, or potential, expression only. It may have ontological primacy, but it needs the engine of change to express and complete itself. 

With that in mind, it becomes much less likely that there is a specific “nonphysical world” than it is that we just don’t understand the world. Matter, time, and physicality are all much more subtle in nature than we have supposed. They contain the ontic primacy of primitive awareness. It is not something “injected” from a mystical outside. There is no need for such an extra requirement, so it becomes a philosophical Typhoid Mary. 

What then does consciousness “do” with the expressions or benefits it acquires in the Change Engine (the biological and physical world)? To the extent that we can answer this, we would have to say that the most likely answer is that it feeds back the output somehow into the same world. In other words, that this is what the process of evolution actually looks like when you include that variable in the mix. I should caution though, it is also quite possible that there is no lasting “benefit”. That the expression is just the thing, the necessity itself, and it has not further utility beyond this. Since it is not possible to conclude one way or the other,  I simply offer both possibilities here. 

Afterlife. In a sense, afterlife is a contradiction in terms. Both ""before-after"" and “life” are properties of the Change Engine (our embodied, living experience). They are not properties that exist “outside” of it. Strictly speaking, there is no outside, there is only an enlargement of context which, because of our organic limitations and sensory modalities, we don’t currently perceive. We don’t have an organ for processing “nonlocality” directly, for example. 

The question of whether there is any meaningful Telos (final destination) of this process is difficult to answer, because we don’t formally know whether everything is wiped and begins again at the end of each instantiation of the whole Change Engine (universe) or whether things gained can in any sense carry over. 

Within the universe, withn one such instantiation at least, the fruits won in my life, or in yours, can pass on to other lives in the future, and if a sufficiently similar being forms, that can even be seen as (a kind of) reincarnation. One would hope, in general, that our lot improves incrementally, with the process. 

Moreover, if you have ignited once as a conscious presence, then the engine of change suggests that (in one way or another at least) you will have that experience again (whether in this round of the engine, or not).",2,1735749339.0,afterlife,2,0.75,False

# Commentaires :

L’année 2024 s’achève avec une performance négative pour mon portefeuille PEA. Cette année a été marquée par une forte volatilité, avec des lignes particulièrement exposées à des dossiers risqués. Certaines valeurs, comme **Prosus** ou **Chemometec**, ont affiché d’excellentes performances, mais celles-ci ont été contrebalancées par des baisses significatives du côté de **Kering** et **Teleperformance**. À noter que, sur les six derniers mois, l’action **SMCP** a presque doublé, progressant d’environ 100 %. Bien que je reste confiant quant à ce dossier, l’incertitude demeure dans le contexte économique actuel. La proportion de cette ligne dans mon portefeuille devrait diminuer progressivement, au gré des apports que je réaliserai. Ces apports ont été plus limités cette année, car d’autres opportunités intéressantes se sont présentées en dehors de ce portefeuille PEA.

Dans l’ensemble, je suis très satisfait des lignes qui composent mon portefeuille et confiant quant à sa performance sur les prochaines années. Adhérant à une approche « value », je reste néanmoins prudent concernant ma ligne **Chemometec**, que je trouve actuellement surévaluée. Malgré cela, je prévois de maintenir une stratégie inspirée du concept de « coffee can », c’est-à-dire conserver mes titres à long terme tant qu’aucune raison majeure ou évolution significative des fondamentaux ne justifie leur vente.

Enfin, j’espère avoir l’occasion, en 2025, de compléter ou finaliser ma ligne **Höegh Autoliners**. À sa valorisation actuelle, cette valeur pourrait tout à fait devenir l’une des principales lignes de mon portefeuille.

Je profite de cette fin de commentaire pour vous souhaiter à tous une excellente année 2025 et mes meilleurs vœux de réussite et de prospérité !

This is far from all of the recaps of the second trial, even from Erik's direct and cross -* [*you can find more of these here.*](https://web.archive.org/web/19961017233040/http://www.courttv.com/casefiles/menendez/summaries/)

**DECEMBER 6**

During his testimony, Erik created for jurors an image of a double life he led at home from the time he was six years old until he was 18: one life inside the bedroom and the other outside the bedroom. Inside the bedroom, he testified, his father was kind, gentle, patient and loving. At the same time, his father molested him, massaging his back and thighs, then his genitals and performing oral copulation on him when he was six years old, Erik said.

""He told me that this was love,"" Erik said, **while appearing to fight back tears.**

But outside the bedroom, Erik testified his father was a domineering brute. He said his father would slap him, punch him and hit him with a belt. And when he cried, Erik testified, his father would hit him again. ""He hated it when I cried,"" he testified.

Erik began his testimony much the same way he did during the first trial -- dealing with the ugly details of sexual abuse. His brother Lyle watched him intently during the testimony, leaning on the counsel table with his head in his hands.

**DECEMBER 7**

Erik Menendez continued to provide gruesome details of the abuse that made him fear his parents enough to kill them.

During his second day on the witness stand, he explained how he was beat, belittled, raped and threatened by his father. He detailed many of the same childhood horrors that he had on the witness stand during the first trial in 1993 - sexual abuse from ages 6 to 18, beatings and angry outbursts from his father, and name calling.

""Sometimes he would call me a sissy, a coward, that I wasn't worthy to be his son, that I was not a Menendez,"" he testified.

**He cried as he told jurors about the continuous torture that mixed violence with sex and a son's duty to his father. As Erik cried, prosecutor David Conn became increasingly agitated and asked for a recess.** Defense attorney Barry Levin interrupted, insisting his client be allowed to continue his testimony. Judge Stanley Weisberg allowed Erik to continue his testimony.

Erik described how his father's ""gentle, loving"" sex changed suddenly one night into violent sex. His father burst into his room, slapped him against a wall, threw him off his bed and forced him to have oral sex, Erik testified.

Eventually, he said, his father sodomized him.

""It hurt me and made me very confused,"" Erik told the jury. ""I just thought it was something I had to overcome and I would get used to it.""

**DECEMBER 8**

The week ended on a dramatic note when the defense showed the jury a large hunting knife allegedly used by Jose Menendez to force himself sexually on his younger son.

""He put his hand down on my forehead and put the knife at my throat and told me that he should kill me and next time he would,"" Erik Menendez said, during his third day on the witness stand.

Erik said the knife incident occurred when, at age 17, he finally had the strength to resist his father's sexual advances. The knife, which has a 12-inch blade, was a souvenir from a ""Rambo"" film. Jose Menendez's company had been involved with the movie. When the knife was brandished, Erik said he submitted to his father's wishes.

""How did you feel?"" asked his lawyer, Barry Levin.

**""I wanted to die,"" he responded.**

As Erik continued his testimony, Judge Stanley Weisberg followed through with a threat to limit testimony about allegations of early childhood abuse. **The judge rejected as irrelevant testimony about Erik becoming injured learning to ride a bicycle.**

The judge said he would limit testimony about events that occurred so long ago that they could have little to do with the brothers' state of mind at the time they killed their parents, **and warned defense attorney Levin that he would not allow the case to be turned into a trial about child abuse.**

**DECEMBER 12**

The scene Erik created for the jurors was one of utter chaos. He said he ran into the den, illuminated only by a TV set, saw the shadow of his father standing by a coffee table, and fired. He said he believed his parents were firing back.

Erik said he did not remember much except for the sounds -- the sounds of the shotgun blasts, the sound of shattering glass and the sounds of his dying mother.

""It was a sound of pain, a sound I continually hear in my mind,"" he told jurors.

Erik said that when the shooting stopped, he and brother sat in the foyer of their home mansion and waited for police to come. Minutes passed, and when they heard no sirens, the brothers decided to try an establish an alibi. They drove to a Century City movie theater, dumped the shotguns off Mulholland Drive, tossed bloody clothes in a trash bin, and drove back home.

When the brothers returned home, Erik went into the den while Lyle called police and went upstairs.

""I remember staring at my father in particular and **just being in shock that my dad could die**, and he was sitting in front of me, dead. I remember thinking how wrong this looked,"" Erik said.

As for his mother, he said, ""I just wondered if she knew it was me, if she was scared. Did she understand? Was she hurting.? I just felt really bad, like a bad person. I just wanted to know what she had thought when I entered the room.""

It was then that he looked for his parents' rifle. When he found none, he said he knew he had ""made a mistake.""

**DECEMBER 18**

Conn attacked Erik's claims that his father forced sex on him even at age 18, when Erik had a car and plenty of money to escape. He even asked Erik why he did not join the military and ""let your father take on the U.S. Army."" Erik said the Army would not have been enough to protect him from his father, who was the ""most powerful man I've ever met."" He said his father, who feared that his sons would expose him as a child molester, would have spent his last cent tracking him down if he had run away.

**The day also was highlighted by Erik's revelation that he had visions of killing his father just three months before the August 20, 1989, slayings of Jose and Kitty Menendez. He said he started to wish his father was dead when he was 13 years old. And in 1988, he said he wished his mother would kill her husband with a new rifle she had purchased.**

Prosecutors contend Erik's statements are evidence of premeditation. But defense lawyers say his truthfulness is typical of an abused person and shows jurors that he has nothing to hide.

Later, Conn raised the issue of Erik's sexual orientation. Conn suggested that Erik exaggerated his involvement with women to hide his true sexuality. Conn asked Erik if his parents ever questioned his sexuality. Erik said they did.

Outside of court, Conn said he wanted to show that Erik's sexuality was a source of tension in the family.",17,1735749117.0,MenendezBrothers,0,1.0,False

I understand that letting the wine ""breathe"" means to let unwanted volatiles evaporate, and also let oxygen mix into the wine. My mental image of the second process is like mixing milk into coffee. Simply letting it sit is the process of diffusion, which is very slow. That's why we swirl the glass, which is similar to using a spoon to mix the milk with the coffee. Instead of diffusion, which is a random walk, we use direct transport, which accelerates the process significantly. My question is, wouldn't the same be achieved by swirling the whole (open, uncorked) bottle? What if we used a big thin spoon to mix the wine in the whole bottle, like the ones used to mix sedimented sugar in a big jar of juice? Conversely, what if we blew bubbles into the wine with a straw? Wouldn't that lead to the same result? Has someone done the experiment?

Also had a lot of iced tea and chocolate, so there was that too. Due to constant poor sleep filled with broken sleep, early awakenings and just taking too long to fall asleep, I decided to cut caffeine out once and for all and see what happened.

After only 5-6 days or so of brutal headaches, intense cravings for coffee and some horrible sleep, I started to sleep better which was amazing. No more taking forever to fall asleep, no broken sleep and no early awakenings. Then about 12 days in I came down with a very bad sinus congestion/sore throat situation. A lot was going around at work, but I also think the stress of quitting cold turkey may have played a role in bringing this on. Still, my sleep was ok during this phase as well and I felt so much better everyday even if I only got 5-6 hours of sleep as opposed to while on caffeine if I got 5-6 hours, or really 7-8, I'd just always feel tired.

I'm now exactly 21 days/3 weeks into this. I've been feeling better from my illness for a good few days, but I feel I've lost ground with sleep. I'm still able to fall asleep quicker and stay asleep in the middle of the night, but I'm having some really bad early morning awakenings to where I can't fall back asleep. This is leaving me feeling exhausted the last few days. Not the exhausted brain fog I felt if I were still on caffeine, but exhausted nonetheless. I don't really understand what's happening. I'm still craving coffee on these tired days but for the most part I thought I was over the hump. Again, I was only a one cup a day guy. I was addicted, yes, but I will be completely honest, I was feeling so good about a week into this that I already wasn't struggling in craving coffee anymore. I guess its possible this is anxiety related? But I really don't feel anxious when going to sleep.",2,1735748490.0,decaf,3,1.0,False

I’m also a big foodie who enjoys discovering new coffee spots and trying different cuisines. Hiking, running, traveling, and exploring new places are some of my favorite ways to unwind. Books are a huge part of my life—I’m an avid reader, particularly of non-fiction, mysteries, and anything by Dan Brown or Paulo Coelho. I’m a shy but good listener who loves deep conversations and exploring different perspectives. If you’re into science, creativity, food, or just enjoy a good chat about life, let’s connect!

No, I don't write thesis' for a living, but this is long...🤣🤣🤣
Ok, although I'm not a super responder like some, my body is responding. Each week seems a little bit different, so listen to your body.
I've completed 18 injections (2.5, 5, 7.5 for 4 weeks each,  10 for 6 weeks), and 13 lbs. My guess is that as I lose, the meds will possibly become more effective. In my mind makes sense, anyway!
My injection site is in the abdomen mostly since on 10mg, and my day is Monday afternoon. Since it makes me drowsy, this works well for me. 
Saturday and Sunday are the most challenging, but I've learned in this short time how to make better choices.
This week: I injected Monday afternoon, slept well, and did my morning walk yesterday (Tuesday). I felt a little bit tired, but I had a good walk. I was Super thirty all day yesterday, so water intake was not a problem. Took my daughter and granddaughter out to lunch. Had a half cup of she-crab soup, and half of a grilled salmon salad. I was full.
I bought the extra salad home and ate it for dinner. I wanted something after midnight so I ate grapes.
I don't suffer from constipation too bad because of required dosage of fiber, so my more movements are wonderful!!😂😂😂
I got up this morning, made my coffee and began moving around in the kitchen. I became a little lightheaded but I attributed to bending in cabinets, looking for a few items (ended up cleaning out a few things while there). Then, I became more lightheaded and jittery. Then I realized it was 10am and I only had half of my coffee. My blood sugar level was dropping. I stopped, grabbed pure protein bar. I don't like the choice, but I needed something quick. I ate it with the rest of my coffee. I immediately started feeling better.
Please don't forget.... Zepbound is prescribed for weight loss, but the SAME meds at Mounjaro, which treats diabetes. Be sure to remember to eat so you don't crash! 
I was diagnosed prediabetic earlier this year and the short time this Zepbound has given me a normal A1C.
Continue to take care and be safe!!! 💕",4,1735748388.0,Zepbound,4,0.83,False

Technically I don’t celebrate Christmas but this is the first year that I feel like I love Christmas time. The carols (Santa baby is stuck in my head haha), the light decorations, the coffee, the quieter roads during the holidays, and just the holiday spirit. I really like Christmas.

2024 has been an absolutely insane year for me, and not in a good way. I'm hoping to leave a lot of what happened behind me and start new in 2025, and to this end, I have resolved to expand my horizons and actually start talking to new people. Crazy, right?

I'm a hobbyist writer, and would love someone to bounce ideas off of. I'm also a big fan of nerd stuff like strategy games, MMORPGs, and Dungeons & Dragons (forever DM by nature, but open to being a player if you know a guy). When I'm not staring at a screen for hours, I'm spending what temperate hours there are in this state looking for good walking trails and walking on them, gardening and woodworking when I can afford to, and being an audiophile... when I can afford to.

I mainly just want someone to chat about mutual interests with, and if we're lucky enough to be local, maybe grab coffee and go out and walk along some shoreline somewhere (there are plenty of them in Maryland). Bonus points if you'd be down to join me when I start going to the gym again. If something more happens from there, I certainly won't be upset.

(Florida and New York also count as 'local' for my purposes--I go to both more often than you might think... and not for the obvious reasons.)

Send a message, I'm almost guaranteed to respond. Just don't be upset if I immediately want to pivot to using Discord or SMS--If there's one thing I hate about Reddit, it's their messaging system.",1,1735748073.0,r4r,1,1.0,False
