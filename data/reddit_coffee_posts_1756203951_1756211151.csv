Aisha was being slowly engulfed by the vines tightening around her blanket cocoon. I moved forward with surprising agility, trying to free her from her prison. All four of my arms were working clumsily, trying to rip the vines apart. I didn‚Äôt know how they moved, but the urgency of the current situation made me push those thoughts back. I tried to focus, tried to make my arms move in some semblance of coordination.  



Aisha looked at me, the horror in her eyes replaced with sleepiness. She had no reaction to me becoming an almost alien creature. She had no reaction to her current predicament as well.  



‚ÄúFuck off,‚Äù she whispered in a small voice. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so peaceful. I can feel the sun, the humidity, and soil. I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ Just buzz off and let me sleep.‚Äù  



‚ÄúAisha, you have to fight it,‚Äù I almost screamed at her. ‚ÄúThis thing, this change‚Ä¶. it reacts to your deepest desire. If you give in‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôll happen.‚Äù A silent sob escaped from my mouth.  



‚ÄúDesire? That‚Äôs okay. Just let me be a tree,‚Äù Aisha whispered, not even making an effort to think about it.  



‚ÄúI know you like to relax and be one with nature. But there are people who need you. I need you. So please fight back.‚Äù I felt my voice tremble. She was a lazy and annoying neighbour. But she was also a friend, my best friend, even though I would never admit it to her.  



She looked into my eyes for a full minute, while I wrestled to keep the vines from engulfing her. Then, with a resigned sigh, she tried to break free. The vines heeded her command, freeing her from her cocoon. She lazily got up and looked longingly at the nest-like structure created by the vines using pillows and blankets.  



‚ÄúI will come back to you, my love. Some people just can‚Äôt live without me,‚Äù she said lovingly to the vines**,** and they shook. She now had two butterfly-like wings coming from her back. Her single vine wrapped around her arm like a bracelet.  



‚ÄúWhat happened to you?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúYou look like the blue alien from Avatar had a baby with an idiot.‚Äù  



‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt. Have you even seen that movie? Anyway, these things have been happening all over the world. I need to go see what happened to the tiny people. Wanna come with me?‚Äù  



‚ÄúLet me make herbal tea first. I don‚Äôt wanna even see your cheap-ass coffee.‚Äù  



I sat back on the couch while Aisha carried a basketful of herbs to my kitchen. I was curious to see what was happening to other people.  



A lot had happened while I was rescuing- I liked the sound of that- Aisha. The tiny couple, the ones the size of mice but with the strength of peak athletes, had started creating videos of tiny living spaces for other people like them. They had repurposed a doll house they had with them. They were trying to fit LEDs from toys into the doll house. There was also a shoe box that was stuffed with a small cushion. It was comical seeing two people working hard among dolls bigger than them. I felt jealous of how comfortable they looked.  



There were other posts. Someone had become a superhero and flew with his father to a hospital when his gun misfired. The guy had the biggest smile on his face.  


Some became their true selves, without the boundaries of gender or shape.  



The guy who had a snake-headed tail was trying to feed it different food. He was still scared. He was still praying while he did it. But they had become odd companions during this confusing time.  



There was a small community of giants, all roughly 10m tall, sharing tips on how to be safe around people. Everyone was supporting each other. But I couldn‚Äôt shake off the anxiety I was feeling inside me.  



If it was people‚Äôs deepest desires giving them form, what happens if it‚Äôs something evil? What was the meaning of my form? What was my desire?

1n0kb0o,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatdoIdo/comments/1n0kb0o/i_feel_like_my_friends_in_college_are_slowly/,I feel like my friends in college are slowly cutting me off and idk how to deal with it,"(rereading this before I post, I sort of feel like this might be a bit of an aitah kind of post and quite long too, sorry) Hello, I'm a third year college student. The semester started this August, but honestly, I don't feel so interested in studying right now. I feel kind of burnt out, unmotivated, and feeling a little bit alone

Might be a long post but I'll try to shorten it much as I can. I study Hospitality Management, and my program covers a lot of things such as Bartending, Food/Beverage and Customer service, that sort of things.

Last semester, we had a subject that was mainly focused on bar operations like bartender/barista operations. We had this laboratory activity with coffee where I broke a french press and the whole class had to pay for it. It cost like maybe 50 dollars, but in Philippine currency, that's like 2,800 pesos. Which is a lot for me. I covered 50% of it and my classmates shared the rest of the amount so we could replace it.

I got into a fight with my friends because of that french press, but we got over it. Or so I thought. I didn't really care that much whether they were really over it because nobody wanted to keep arguing, the french press was replaced, that was it.

Then for another subject we had which was basically cooking, me and a friend were grouped together. We didn't have a pot holder for the pan we were using so I used my folded up apron as a potholder. I left my friend to the stove for a minute and when I came back, my apron was missing because friend lent it to another classmate, and that classmate had apparently lost it. I'm not very confrontational, but I panicked at that moment and didn't know what to do. I felt very upset so I ignored my friend after we were done cooking, which was kind of an ass move on my part. We didn't talk until the next semester, which was just this month.

Now this semester, we have a thesis coming up so we had to group ourselves into groups of 5 people. Our friend group had 6 people in it and I was sort of hoping they would put me in their group, but I was of course left out. I low-key expected that tbh but I was still bummed. Luckily I was able to form a group with my other classmates.

It's been maybe a week since that happened, but I feel like that's probably the biggest reason why I feel so unmotivated to, yk, keep studying this semester. I usually like going to school but this semester I feel so drained and tired and a little alone. I know somewhere down the line I was an ass to them to an extent but I feel like I'm being shut out by who I thought were my friends and groupmates

They haven't talked to me much as well and I really just don't know how to go from here. 

What do I do? Do I confront them? (I don't want to), do I just let them do their thing and I'll do mine? I need advice üò≠üôè",1,1756210826.0,whatdoIdo,0,1.0,False

1n0k8d9,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpotlessSecrets/comments/1n0k8d9/explore_pure_organic_ingredients_washing_soda_is/,Explore Pure Organic Ingredients washing soda is it worth using daily,"**A First-Hand Experience with Pure Organic Ingredients Natural Washing Soda**

Using the Pure Organic Ingredients Natural Washing Soda has become a part of my daily cleaning routine, and I must say, it delivers on multiple levels. Hearing so much about its versatility, I initially picked it up because of its claims of being a hypoallergenic, non-toxic solution that could handle a variety of cleaning tasks. Packaged conveniently in Utah, USA, I felt that this product deserved a shot in my eco-conscious household.

**An Eco-Friendly Design that Doesn‚Äôt Compromise Functionality**  
The first thing I noticed when this product arrived was its practical and no-frills packaging. The 2 lb package is compact yet sufficient for a plethora of uses. Its simple design screams utility, which I appreciate since the focus remains on what's inside. For someone like me trying to cut down on chemical-laden products, the fact that it contains no additives is a huge plus. The hypoallergenic properties make it safe for anyone sensitive to harsh chemicals, and I‚Äôve even used it on delicate cleaning tasks without a hitch.

[Looking for Pure Organic Ingredients Natural Washing Soda? Discover the price on Amazon.](https://blog.senaar.com/p/b06y3c8wkj/)

**Performance That Surpasses Expectations**  
Calling it a multipurpose cleaner feels like an understatement. I‚Äôve used this washing soda in various ways; from softening the hard water in my laundry to scrubbing out stubborn stains on tile surfaces, it doesn‚Äôt fail to impress. A notable mention: tough coffee stains on kitchen counters? Gone in no time after mixing this with warm water. It's satisfying to have one product that can handle so many jobs. While I haven‚Äôt tested it in every conceivable scenario, its performance has been more consistent than many branded, single-purpose cleaning products I‚Äôve used before.

**Ease of Use While Remaining effective**  
Mixing this powder with water, creating DIY cleaning paste, or even adding it to my laundry routine is a breeze. The sodium carbonate works particularly well in boosting the effectiveness of regular detergent, making everything come out cleaner, especially in hard water situations. Even my coworker started using it after I raved about how fresh-smelling my linens were post-wash. It‚Äôs not a miracle worker where heavy grime is concerned, but for everyday cleaning jobs, it keeps life simple and manageable.

**Strengths**  
Here‚Äôs why I think everyone should give this product a chance:

- The pure ingredients ensure no harmful additives or questionable substances.  
- Works great as a water softener, especially in hard water scenarios.  
- Perfect for DIY enthusiasts looking for a customizable, eco-friendly cleaner.  

**Limitations**  
No product is perfect, and there are a few areas where this washing soda could improve:

- The packaging lacks resealability, which can make storing it a bit tricky without transferring it to a separate container.  
- Some users might find the powder‚Äôs consistency slightly coarse for specific applications.  

**Product Comparisons with Market Rivals**  
Comparing the Pure Organic Ingredients Natural Washing Soda to traditional store-bought multipurpose cleaners, one clear advantage is its purity. Unlike some competitors that include chemical blends, fragrances, and artificial agents, this product keeps it clean and straightforward. While brands like Arm & Hammer also offer washing soda products, I found their formulations to be less focused on the ‚Äúnatural‚Äù and ‚Äúpure‚Äù aspect. This product‚Äôs hypoallergenic advantage makes it perfect for households with sensitive skin‚Äîa qualifying point the competition sometimes misses.

However, if I need to deep-clean something, like an oven or severely stained outdoor furniture, I might lean toward a heavy-duty product specifically designed for that purpose. Pure Organic Ingredients Natural Washing Soda holds its ground in day-to-day, eco-friendly cleaning but isn‚Äôt necessarily one-size-fits-all.

**Bang for the Buck**  
For a budget-conscious individual, this product is a smart investment. Its versatility and the sheer number of uses make it cost-effective in the long run. Compared to pricier chemical-heavy cleaners that need to be bought separately for specific tasks, this sodium carbonate powder simplifies things while saving you serious money over time. Though it won‚Äôt stretch to meet every possible cleaning need, what it does cover is significant enough to deem it worth every penny.

1n0k7qo,https://i.redd.it/p8r6pb1ovclf1.png,Succo anguria e caff√® freddo,"Il succo di anguria e caff√® freddo √® un drink rinfrescante e insolito, perfetto per l'estate. La dolcezza e la freschezza dell'anguria si sposano inaspettatamente bene con il sapore intenso e amaro del caff√®.
Ecco una ricetta semplice per prepararlo a casa.
Ingredienti
 * 300 g di anguria senza semi
 * 80 ml di caff√® espresso (o caff√® della moka) freddo
 * Ghiaccio
 * Zucchero o sciroppo d'agave (facoltativo, a seconda della dolcezza dell'anguria)
 * Foglie di menta o una fetta di limone per guarnire (facoltativo)
Preparazione
 * Prepara il succo di anguria: Taglia l'anguria a cubetti, rimuovi la buccia e i semi. Metti i cubetti in un frullatore e frulla fino a ottenere un succo liscio e omogeneo. Se preferisci, puoi filtrarlo con un colino a maglie fini per eliminare eventuali fibre residue.
 * Prepara il caff√®: Prepara il caff√® espresso o con la moka e lascialo raffreddare completamente.
 * Unisci gli ingredienti: Riempi un bicchiere alto con il ghiaccio. Versa il succo di anguria fino a riempire circa met√† del bicchiere. Se l'anguria non √® abbastanza dolce, aggiungi un po' di zucchero o sciroppo e mescola bene.
 * Aggiungi il caff√®: Con delicatezza, versa il caff√® freddo sopra il succo di anguria. Il caff√®, essendo pi√π denso, rimarr√† sopra il succo, creando un bellissimo effetto a strati.
 * Servi: Puoi mescolare prima di bere, o gustare gli strati separatamente. Guarnisci con una foglia di menta o una fetta di limone per un tocco in pi√π.
Consigli
 * Per un sapore pi√π intenso, puoi usare il caff√® preparato a freddo (cold brew).
 * Se vuoi una versione pi√π cremosa, puoi aggiungere un goccio di latte di cocco o una spruzzata di panna vegetale in cima.
 * Assicurati che sia il succo di anguria che il caff√® siano ben freddi prima di unirli.
 * Per un tocco estivo, puoi preparare dei cubetti di ghiaccio con il succo di anguria e usarli al posto del ghiaccio normale.
Goditi questo mix rinfrescante e sorprendentemente delizioso!
Mi chiedi nove ricette, dolci e salate, che uniscano due ingredienti inusuali come il succo di anguria e il caff√® freddo. √à una sfida interessante! L'anguria √® dolce e rinfrescante, mentre il caff√® √® amaro e intenso. L'abbinamento crea un contrasto che pu√≤ essere usato in modi molto creativi.

1n0k78z,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/1n0k78z/my_experience_as_an_african_dn/,My Experience as an African DN,"I started my digital nomad journey earlier this year, and I‚Äôve been on the road for about 8 months now. Before starting, I heard so many inspiring stories and was really excited but one thing I didn‚Äôt realize later was that most of the people I spoke to weren‚Äôt African.

In the past 8 months, I‚Äôve traveled through 10 countries across Africa and Southeast Asia. As an African (I don't have residency anywhere else), it was somewhat easier moving around different countries in Africa, but the challenges were huge. There was poor infrastructure (internet, electricity, coffee shops, etc) in many places and extremely high costs in others. Flying across Africa is also crazily expensive!

When I got to Southeast Asia, the difference was massive. The infrastructure here is way better compared to the other countries I visited. Fast internet, tons of coffee shops, co-working spaces, and stable electricity. And the hospitality I have experienced here has been unmatched. 

But my passport has been the biggest barrier. I can only enter the Philippines and Singapore without extreme hassle. Even then, both required immigration singled me out for interviews. I had to show them documents, private chats with some contacts I had and even proof of my work emails. Sometimes they called my hotel to confirm I have a booking or called a friend and asked if they will really be meeting me while I am in the country.

Vietnam was amazing, but I had to pay an exorbitant fee (6x the cost) for a short 30-day visa (the only one available to me). Crossing into Cambodia by land from Vietnam was even worse; immigration there was such a frustrating experience that I almost turned back entirely.

I love the culture, the people, and the lifestyle in SEA, but the strict immigration rules for people with African passports and my low finances makes it really tough. Honestly, the whole experience has been enriching, but if you‚Äôre African and thinking of doing the digital nomad thing, you‚Äôll need thick skin and a lot of money.

1n0k735,https://i.redd.it/64jb2o8kvclf1.jpeg,I got mindful about sugar,"The change in my energy has been insane. I went from needing a nap every afternoon to having steady, consistent energy all day long.

**The hardest Things to cut out**

My Morning Coffee: I used to load it with flavored creamer, which is basically just sugar syrup. The first few days of black coffee were rough.

* The Swap: Now I use a splash of unsweetened almond milk and a sprinkle of cinnamon. It‚Äôs creamy, tastes amazing, and has zero sugar.

""Healthy"" Snacks: My go-to was granola bars. I was shocked when I read the label and saw how much sugar was packed in there.

* The Swap: A handful of almonds and an apple. It gives me actual energy instead of a sugar spike and crash.

Late-Night Cravings: My biggest weakness was a bowl of ice cream before bed.

* The Swap: A bowl of Greek yogurt with some fresh berries. It satisfies the craving for something creamy and sweet without derailing my progress.

And I can't forget my Daily Meditation. When a craving hits, taking just a few minutes to breathe helps me realize I'm probably just stressed or bored, not actually hungry.

**And here‚Äôs the thing that really hit me:** it‚Äôs not just about the sugar itself, it‚Äôs about how much we‚Äôre being pushed toward it every single day. Advertisers know exactly how to wear us down. They design ads and packaging to hit us at our weakest moments, and it‚Äôs no coincidence that low-income neighborhoods and minorities are targeted more aggressively by companies like Coca-Cola, Pepsi, and fast-food giants. It‚Äôs basically social engineering, nudging us into behaviors that keep the consumer machine running while wrecking our health.

I've been thinking about something lately and I'm genuinely curious about your perspectives. I keep seeing people religiously following influencers (both Moroccan and international) who literally just post themselves eating, shopping, or having random small talk. Like, their entire content is just... living their daily life?

I honestly can't wrap my head around it. What's the psychological appeal here? What am I missing?

* Why do people get invested in watching someone else eat a meal or buy clothes?
* Is it the aspirational lifestyle thing? The ""I wish I had their life"" factor?
* Or is it more about parasocial relationships - feeling like these influencers are their friends?
* Maybe it's escapism from their own routine?

**In the Moroccan context specifically**, I notice we have influencers who literally just document their day in Rabat/Casa/Marrakech, show their morning coffee, their outfit, their grocery shopping... and they have hundreds of thousands of followers hanging on every story.

I'm not judging anyone - I'm genuinely trying to understand the psychology behind it. Maybe there's something therapeutic about it that I'm not seeing? Or maybe it's just entertainment in its simplest form?

For those of you who follow these types of influencers - what draws you to their content? What do you get out of it?

And for those who, like me, don't really get it - do you have any theories about why this type of content is so popular?

Looking forward to hearing different perspectives on this!",2,1756210331.0,Morocco,2,1.0,False

where breathing itself feels like too much.
I sip my coffee as if it saves me,
but mostly it just tastes like waiting.
The world outside rushes without slowing,
while my chest moves heavy, then slow.
I tell myself ‚Äújust one more step,‚Äù
like survival is stitched into tiny promises.
The window glows with soft yellow light,
reminding me the world still holds warmth.
I do not need to win the day,
sometimes just breathing is proof I stayed.
Hope doesn‚Äôt roar, it whispers instead,
quiet enough to keep me alive.
Each sunrise carries a fragile chance,
each shadow eventually breaks toward light.

Once she‚Äôs finally down, she‚Äôs fine and wakes up happy, refreshed, all smiles but getting her there is a nightmare. 

She will scream. Not just fuss, but full on exorcism purple crying. It can take 10 minutes on a good day, but usually we‚Äôre talking 20 - 30 minutes of protest before she finally gives up. I assume from sheer exhaustion, not because my soothing skills are impressive. Clearly they are not. 

I tried the following with little to no success:

- White Noise: Might as well play loud music, hates it.
- Baby Wearing: She‚Äôs ok with but only outside and only if I keep walking. Obviously the weather has to cooperate for this. And she won‚Äôt take a nap any longer than it takes for me to grab a coffee either so she‚Äôs still tired after. However, she doesn‚Äôt scream. Semi-success! 
- Pram: Lol let me not even elaborate. Awful.
- Cot: Only at night she‚Äôll happily sleep there. During the day? No chance.
- Next to me on top of my bed: The worst one. Arching her neck, flinging arms and legs everywhere.
- Holding her / Rocking: Makes it even worse, hates it.
- Dark room: Screams the second I turn the lights off.
- Bottle to sleep: Sometimes works when she‚Äôs hungry but otherwise she looks at me like I‚Äôm insulting her.
- Dummy: Spits it out.

I‚Äôm also sticking to a somewhat strict routine, which sometimes works under the condition that I manage to get her down before she‚Äôs overtired. But if I miss that microscopic window? Absolute chaos. However I notice it‚Äôs even worse if I don‚Äôt attempt to get her to nap every 1 1/2-2h or when she shows even one single cue she‚Äôs tired. 

The only semi-reliable trick we have is the car seat. She‚Äôll actually nap in it but only if the car is moving. That‚Äôs impossible with all the traffic in London and I also read 500 different opinions online about how long babies can safely sleep in them, anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours?, and also, I don‚Äôt drive so I‚Äôd have to wait for my boyfriend to come back from work which doesn‚Äôt happen before 5 pm.

1n0k160,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBagCheck/comments/1n0k160/should_you_buy_the_wrangler_smart_luggage_set/,Should You Buy the Wrangler Smart Luggage Set Review Features USB and Cup Holder,"The Wrangler Smart Luggage Set with Cup Holder, USB Port, and Phone Holder, model WR-20272-001, is undoubtedly an ingenious solution for modern travel. Known for its combination of functionality and user-friendly features, this luggage set aims to make trips more practical and enjoyable. After testing it extensively, I‚Äôve found that while it excels in many areas, there are some things to keep in mind before deciding if it‚Äôs the right choice for you.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Right off the bat, the visual appeal of this luggage set strikes a chord. The sleek black finish gives the set an understated elegance that‚Äôs perfect for travel, whether for business or leisure. What particularly impressed me were the double spinner wheels. Gliding this suitcase through airports felt nearly effortless, thanks to the 360-degree movement allowed by these wheels. The carrying handle feels sturdy in hand, and the overall construction did not scream ""compromise,"" despite its lightweight 6.3-pound design. I even dropped it a couple of times to test how well it could hold up, and I was relieved to find zero scratches or dents‚Äîdefinitely a bonus. But let‚Äôs talk about the real selling feature: the patented 3-in-1 cup holder, USB port, and phone holder. I didn‚Äôt realize how much I needed these until I had them. Juggling a coffee, phone, and boarding pass while rolling luggage is a nightmare this set solves remarkably.  

**Check [Wrangler Smart Luggage Set WR-20272-001] deals on Amazon now.**  

**Features That Stand Out**  
A 3-in-1 feature might sound like a gimmick, but it‚Äôs genuinely a massive convenience. I tested all three functions. The phone holder was a surprising lifesaver during my last layover; being able to watch an episode of my favorite series hands-free while charging my device was wonderful. The USB port is similarly useful, although I found it a little disappointing that no power bank comes included‚Äîbudgeting for an additional battery pack might be necessary. The carry-on also boasts an expandable feature for extra packing space, which I utilized to fit in an extra outfit and a small set of toiletries without any issue. The fully lined interior and additional pockets make organizing a breeze. Packing no longer feels like a chaotic ordeal but an almost therapeutic task because everything has a place.

**Advantages**  
- User-friendly 3-in-1 cup holder, USB, and phone holder ensures unmatched convenience.  
- Lightweight build coupled with double spinner wheels makes mobility seamless.  
- Expandable storage provides extra packing capacity.  

**Usability on the Go**  
Navigating through crowded train stations and hectic airports can turn into a stressful experience, but this luggage set eased that considerably for me. The carry-on size was accepted by all airlines I traveled with, fitting snugly in the overhead compartments without requiring any awkward jams. I was skeptical at first about the balance of the 3-in-1 feature, thinking my coffee might tip over mid-roll, but the design is remarkably stable. Even during high-speed sprints across terminals, the setup held secure.  

**Negatives**  
- Absence of an included power pack undermines the USB port utility.  
- The 14-inch boarding tote's capacity feels limited compared to the main suitcase.  

**Target Users**  
Casual travelers, business professionals, and even families can all appreciate what this luggage set offers. A coworker who travels weekly borrowed my set for their business trip and raved about it upon return, labeling it as the ‚Äúultimate jet-setting companion.‚Äù Personally, I think digital nomads who highly value multitasking will get the most mileage. Having features like a USB port and phone holder inherently caters to those constantly on their devices. If you‚Äôre someone who finds even the smallest bits of efficiency exhilarating during your busy schedules, this set is a dream come true.

**Competing Brands**  
The market is brimming with luggage sets claiming to make trips easier. Samsonite, for example, offers durable and stylish options in their Omni PC series, but they don‚Äôt include any innovative convenience features like the Wrangler‚Äôs 3-in-1 setup. Another competitor, American Tourister, boasts colorful designs and sturdy frames; however, their wheel quality falls short of the smooth gliding experience of this set‚Äôs double spinner wheels. While the Wrangler Smart Luggage Set shines in terms of portability and functionality, competitors sometimes outperform with greater durability or better warranties. The choice ultimately depends on what someone values most in a suitcase.

**Smart Spending**  
While I won‚Äôt delve into specific prices, the value this set delivers compared to similarly featured luggage is nothing to scoff at. Given the thoughtful integration of user-centric features, the price-to-quality ratio feels favorable. It‚Äôs evident that the designers prioritized traveler convenience, and the robust build ensures that the set will last well. Still, if you already have a great battery pack lying around and don‚Äôt mind spending a bit more for premium materials, alternatives like Samsonite‚Äôs high-end series might serve you better.

**INDUSTRY:** Food & Beverage / Retail

**BUSINESS SIZE:** Small Team (4 employees, family-owned)

**THE CHALLENGE:** We've run ""Maya's Coffee Corner"" for 8 years in downtown Springfield. Last year, Starbucks opened 2 blocks away and we've lost nearly 40% of our regular customers. Our coffee is arguably better (we roast our own beans), our prices are competitive, and our staff knows every regular by name. But people are drawn to the Starbucks brand, convenience, and mobile ordering.

We're not just losing customers - we're losing our identity. Trying to copy Starbucks feels wrong, but ignoring them is killing us. Our revenue dropped from $28K/month to $17K/month. We're bleeding money and morale is terrible.

**WHAT YOU'VE TRIED:**

* Loyalty punch cards (minimal impact)
* Social media promotions (gained followers but not customers)
* Extended hours (increased costs, didn't increase sales proportionally)
* ""Local business"" marketing (feels desperate and guilt-trippy)
* Partnering with local artists for wall space (nice atmosphere, zero revenue impact)

**CONSTRAINTS:**

* Budget: $3,000 maximum for any solution
* Timeline: Need to see improvement within 3 months or we're closing
* Resources: Maya (owner), 2 full-time baristas, 1 part-time
* Other: Can't relocate, lease locked for 2 years

**SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE:**

* Get back to $25K+ monthly revenue
* Create something Starbucks can't easily replicate
* Build a sustainable competitive advantage
* Make our ""local"" status an actual profit driver, not just a nice story

**ADDITIONAL CONTEXT:** Our space is small (30 seats) but cosy. We're in a mixed business/residential area with a university 6 blocks away. Our coffee quality is genuinely superior - we've won 2 local taste competitions.

Hit the gym for 2 hours. Read 50 pages a day. Completely overhaul my diet. Go from zero to hero in a week.

You know what happened? I'd burn out in 5 days and quit everything. So I decided to take a step back. And start from the bottom. 2 years later I've read over 20 books and have lost 20kg.

Here are the 9 stupidly simple habits that transformed my life one tiny step at a time:

* Habit 1 - Read 10 pages every morning. Not 50. Not a whole book. Just 10 pages with your coffee. That's 3,650 pages a year. About 12-15 books. You'll accidentally become one of the most well-read people you know.
* Habit 2 - Did 10 push ups the moment I woke up. Before checking your phone. Before coffee. Before anything else. It's not about getting ripped. It's about proving to yourself that you can do hard things first thing in the morning.
* Habit 3 - Writing down what I'm grateful for. Takes 2 minutes. Rewires your brain to notice good things instead of only problems. After 6 months, you'll be the person who finds silver linings while everyone else complains.
* Habit 4 - Drinking water before doing anything. 2 glasses of water when you wake up. Before coffee, before anything. Your brain is dehydrated after 8 hours of sleep. Feed it water first, stimulants second.
* Habit 5 - Making the bed Sounds stupid. Works incredibly well. You start every day with a completed task. You end every day coming home to something neat and organized.
* Habit 6 - Daily walks after a meal. Not a workout. Just a walk around the block. Better digestion, improved mood, clearer thinking. Plus you'll accidentally get 8,000+ steps a day.
* Habit 7 - Phone in another room at night. Charge it somewhere else. Use an actual alarm clock. Better sleep, better mornings, less mindless scrolling. Your future self will thank you.
* Habit 8 - Learned everyday. A word. A fact. A skill. Anything. Watch a 5-minute YouTube tutorial. Read a Wikipedia page. Ask someone to teach you something.
* Habit 9 - Planned the day before. Spend 5 minutes writing down your top 3 priorities for the next day. Wake up with purpose instead of decision fatigue.

It took sometime to fully integrate all this habits but I'm so glad I pushed through. I hope I motivate you to do the same as well.",8,1756209561.0,Habits,0,1.0,False

As my little one gets older, im starting to feel like she isn‚Äôt the right fit for us. 

I‚Äôve asked her to stay inside more and engage in more focused, educational activities, (most of which I set up), and she will will stick to it for a couple of days and then drift back into old routines. 

If I leave them to their own devices, she will literally just put the baby in the car, drive to a park, (when we have about 10 parks in walking distance), sit in a cafe with a coffee, then come home to do nap/lunch/play then i finish work and take over at 4pm. 
I don‚Äôt feel like my baby gets much focus on her development and the EYFS isn‚Äôt referenced. She‚Äôs just like a little mate going out on errands with her nanny. 

I‚Äôve confronted the nanny about this and she‚Äôs said she‚Äôs happy but she would rather make her own schedule - which she knows I‚Äôm not happy for her to do. 

I‚Äôve bought them annual passes for local attractions, National Trust passes, I‚Äôve introduced her to local people I know for play dates and she doesn‚Äôt really do any of those things.

I feel like I‚Äôm trying to imprison them and I‚Äôm being made to feel unreasonable - do you really need to be in the car and up and out every day? Am I wrong about something here? 

I take as much time with my toddler as possible and we are always busy learning or walking or crafting or going on nature trails.

1n0jpzt,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatItsLike/comments/1n0jpzt/uncover_if_angel_soft_ultra_toilet_paper_truly/,Uncover If Angel Soft Ultra Toilet Paper Truly Delivers Comfort,"**A Real Test of Angel Soft 79342: My Daily Experience**  

Toilets aren't typically topics of daily conversation, but toilet paper? Absolutely. After trying the Angel Soft 79342 on a whim, I realized there's more to tissue than meets the eye‚Äîespecially when you're tasked with restocking it regularly in a lively household like mine. This seemingly simple product found its way into my life, and after weeks of testing it with family, I have an honest take on what works and what might not. Spoiler alert‚Äîit‚Äôs been a mix of delight and slight frustrations.  

**Comfort and Strength: Perfect Balance**  

One thing I immediately loved about these rolls was just how soft and strong they were. No one wants their toilet tissue to either disintegrate mid-use or feel like sandpaper‚ÄîAngel Soft strikes the perfect balance. The 2-ply sheets genuinely deliver on the softness promise, as advertised, and are remarkably strong for their category. I even tried a little experiment by soaking a small sheet under the faucet. While it softened with water (as paper naturally does), it maintained integrity better than many competing brands I‚Äôve used.  

**A Household Delight: Bigger Rolls, Fewer Changes**  

With six mega rolls equating to 24 regular ones, you really do change the roll far less often. In a household of five, the convenience of these ""bigger-is-better"" rolls became evident pretty quickly. Fewer roll changes meant everyone stopped the notorious habit of leaving an empty roll behind in the bathroom‚Äîa win in my book! This aspect alone might make it a game-changer for families who go through toilet tissue faster than coffee in the morning.  

[Check Angel Soft 79342 price on Amazon.](https://info.sanue.com/p/b08xzvsk77/)  

**Eco-Friendliness and Usability**  

The Angel Soft Ultra rolls are made from SFI sustainably sourced trees, which honestly eased my environmental guilt a little. Being septic safe was another selling point, as I didn't have to worry about clogs in our old plumbing system. Well-maintained septic systems seemed to handle it as promised‚Äîthere‚Äôs been no hint of blockages (thank goodness).  

Even with its usability, I did notice that while loading the roll onto my standard holder, the mega size was slightly snug until it had been used for a couple of days. It fit, but the tightness was real. That being said, this was a small annoyance in an otherwise convenient feature.  

**Durability Test in Messy Situations**  

Don‚Äôt laugh, but whenever a household product sits in front of me for too long, I inevitably test it in unconventional ways‚Äîsometimes unintentionally. These ultra-strong and soft sheets became my go-to kitchen wipe for spills when I ran out of napkins last week. While not its intended use, it cleaned up liquids decently without shredding to bits. Granted, it‚Äôs not a substitute for paper towels, but it's handy in a pinch‚Äîwho knew toilet paper could be so versatile?  

**Pluses**  

- Delivers on both softness and strength without compromise  
- Mega rolls save time on constant replacements  
- Made with sustainably sourced materials, adding an eco-conscious element  
- Perfectly septic-safe for well-maintained systems  
- Surprisingly versatile when used beyond its intended purpose  

**Critiques**  

- Mega roll size can feel a bit snug on standard holders until used down slightly  
- Not ideal for those with limited storage, as the bigger rolls take up more space  
- Lacks unique patterns or textures for households who prefer a ""fancier"" look in their bathrooms  

**Competing Products**  

Having tried other big-brand options before, Angel Soft certainly held its own. It outperformed its competitors in both combined softness and durability, giving something like Charmin Ultra a run for its premium image. However, while Angel Soft edges ahead for families on a budget, it doesn't feel as plush as the high-end varieties from Quilted Northern or Cottonelle. That said, its septic safety is superior as some premium brands can cause blockages even when they claim otherwise.  

**Cost Efficiency**  

This tissue strikes a fantastic balance between affordability and quality. While it's not as cheap as single-ply generic alternatives, you really feel the improvement in comfort and usability for every penny spent. Considering the longevity of these larger rolls and fewer replacements needed, it's hard to argue with the value it offers. For households looking to save without sacrificing quality, it‚Äôs an easy pick in my books.

1n0jpxk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marathon_Training/comments/1n0jpxk/charity_slot_finish_times_musings_over_coffee/,Charity slot finish times: Musings over coffee,"I‚Äôm sitting here drinking another cup of coffee as I put off my long run further and further, reading Reddit running threads.  

A post graphing out average marathon finish times over the last few decades made me wonder: is the increase in overall Average Marathon Times becoming slower driven by an increase / advent of charity slots being offered?  

Or more simply put: **Have charity slots led to slower marathon finish times.**

Not all races have or need charity slots - I‚Äôm not sure if races that don‚Äôt fill up even offer them. But most (all?) of the Majors and many (most?) of the larger races / those which tend to sell out, offer charity slots as a way in for many people.  We all know that (or do now). 

**What do charity slot average finish times look like vs non charity slots average finish times?**

There‚Äôd be many factors to consider:  anyone gaining entry via ‚Äúgood for age‚Äù / ‚Äúage based qualifier times,‚Äù Pros, Local Elite invites, etc. will drive overall finish times way down, but that doesn‚Äôt mean everyone gaining entry via charity slot is slow. Or those who got in via lottery, just signed up in time, did a 9+1 (NYCM), are a streaker, etc. are fast. 

I‚Äôm heavily involved in the running world and have been for decades. I coach marathoners,
I‚Äôve been a sponsored runner for years, I‚Äôve been pacing the Majors for a decade+, I‚Äôve written marathon training plans for major brands and apps, I‚Äôve finished north of 100 marathons myself.  I‚Äôm someone who finds themselves talking to runners (and marathoners) all the time.  And thinking about marathons all the time.  I‚Äôm also a researcher by profession. 

Anecdotally, I‚Äôve noticed a lot of slow runners gaining entry to races via charity.  I can‚Äôt recall a lot of the ‚Äúpretty damn fast but not super fast‚Äù runners I‚Äôve known entering marathons via charity. 

As a researcher I‚Äôm aware I‚Äôve got some degree of selection bias or blinders. But I am paid to spot tends and reportedly good at my job. 

So I wonder about this. 


Additionally, this isn‚Äôt meant to suggest a slow finish time is less meaningful or isn‚Äôt as valid - you can come into this with existing beliefs about the value of ‚Äújust finishing‚Äù vs the value of ‚Äúbeing competitive‚Äù or ‚Äúracing‚Äù or anything else.  Or no opinion whatsoever.  It‚Äôs just purely curiosity and I wonder what the numbers say. 

What do you think?  Anyone want to go try to dig up some data?

They have a generous refer-a-friend scheme where you earn a **free ¬£50 credit** when you switch your energy to them. You're eligible if you have a smart meter, standard meter or economy 7 meter but you‚Äôd need to switch both your gas and electricity. Another plus: NO FEES if you decide to switch out elsewhere at any time!

**How to get your free ¬£50 bonus with Octopus Energy:**

1. [Sign up to Octopus using my ¬£50 refer-a-friend link here](https://share.octopus.energy/quiet-mouse-344)
2. Enter your post code and answer questions about your current energy use to receive a price quote. Click ""Sign me up"" to see the details about the proposed tariff, then confirm the switch once you‚Äôre happy.
3. Enter your gas and electricity meter ID/serial numbers, so have an old bill ready as this info will be on there already. Octopus is brilliant at updating you via email on the whole process with what you need to do at each step.
4. Your ¬£50 reward will be credited to your account after your first direct debit has been taken - I received mine 2 weeks after the direct debit.

**My hot tips:**

* When getting your quote, enter your ‚Äúactual‚Äù energy usage using an old bill instead of choosing the ‚Äúlow, medium, high‚Äù options to keep your direct debit payments accurate
* In your online account, you can reduce your monthly direct debits if you think they're too high - I lowered my mine by about 70%!

**My experience + timeline:**

I switched from Shell Energy to Octopus as it worked out cheaper across the board for both gas and electricity, so the ¬£50 switch reward was a total bonus. The ¬£50 was applied to my account less than 2 weeks after my first direct debit was taken and the switch process was probably the smoothest I‚Äôve ever experienced. If you have a smart meter, you can also claim a free Caffe Nero or Greggs coffee each week as a free perk. Another plus: NO FEES if you decide to switch out elsewhere at any time!

1n0jhdd,https://www.reddit.com/r/dubairealestate/comments/1n0jhdd/dubai_commercial_real_estate_snapshot/,Dubai Commercial Real Estate Snapshot,"If you think Dubai property is only about penthouses with infinity pools and Instagram reels from Palm Jumeirah, here‚Äôs your reality check. The real story & frankly the smarter money, might be sitting quietly in the beige, overlooked world of commercial property.

The Big Picture: What‚Äôs Actually Happening
Residential supply is in turbo mode. Developers have launched almost 95 new projects in Q1 2025 alone, adding over 28,000 units into the pipeline. By year-end, nearly 42,000 keys are expected to be handed over. That‚Äôs a lot of shiny towers hitting the market at once. As one broker in JVC told me over coffee last week, ‚ÄúI have more landlords than tenants calling me every day.‚Äù The imbalance is real, and it will start showing in rental yields.

Commercial? Different story. Dubai‚Äôs office stock is roughly 9.6 million sqm, and 2025 will only see about 890,000 sq ft delivered. If you‚Äôre walking around DIFC or Business Bay, you‚Äôll notice it, agents say they‚Äôre getting multiple offers for well-located Grade A spaces, and smaller flex offices are being snapped up faster than they can be listed. A friend leasing in Business Bay joked that finding a 2,000 sq ft fitted office these days feels like ‚Äútrying to book a Burj Khalifa view suite on New Year‚Äôs Eve.‚Äù

What It Means for Investors
New investors are swayed by the apparent abundance of residential, it‚Äôs easy to buy, and you‚Äôll find plenty of choice. But oversupply could squeeze rentals within two to three years. That ‚Äú10% guaranteed ROI‚Äù that every billboard in Arjan screams about? Expect it to soften.

For seasoned investors, the distinction is obvious. Residential is crowded, with landlords undercutting one another. Commercial stock, on the other hand, has scarcity on its side. That‚Äôs why leasing managers in DIFC say ‚Äúclients are renewing instead of moving‚Äù  simply because there aren‚Äôt better options. Scarcity gives owners room to negotiate rents instead of racing to the bottom.

Where the Opportunity Is Hiding
Value add small offices: There‚Äôs a clear trend for companies to downsize from large traditional spaces to smaller, modern, flexible offices. A tired building in Deira or Karama renovated into plug n play co-working style offices could easily outperform. One landlord near Al Rigga recently refurbished a whole floor with glass partitions and high-speed internet, and hit 95% occupancy in weeks.

Last mile logistics: E-commerce warehouses along Al Quoz and Dubai South are in demand. A logistics agent there mentioned to me: ‚ÄúEven older hangars are leasing, as long as they‚Äôre close to highway exits.‚Äù It may look boring from the outside, but the rent checks are anything but.

Retail tied to community growth: Forget giant malls on the outskirts, what‚Äôs hot are mid-size retail clusters attached to new communities. Just look at the buzz around retail strips next to metro stations in Al Furjan and new residential in JVC. Tenants are circling because foot traffic is guaranteed.

Selective off-plan commercial: Off-plan offices exist, but choose your developer wisely. Ask around, and you‚Äôll hear horror stories of investors stuck waiting 3 or 4 years past advertised handovers. Stick to names with proven deliver, otherwise it‚Äôs a gamble.

Investor Checklist
Timelines are often ‚ÄúDubai optimistic.‚Äù If a developer says 2026, assume 2027.

Run numbers conservatively. Your ROI should hold even if rents pull back.

Don‚Äôt be fooled by glossy brochures. Dig into actual tenant profiles. A space leased to three startups running crypto Telegram groups? That‚Äôs not stable income.

Factor VAT, service charges, and Dubai‚Äôs increasingly structured licensing costs into your returns. Many returns look amazing until those eat away at net yield.

Bottom Line
Dubai 2025 is essentially two very different markets. Residential remains busy, with lots of launches and flashy marketing, but the returns could flatten once those 40,000 new apartments hit. Commercial is the quieter corner, less hype, less supply, but that scarcity is exactly what makes it interesting.

Brokers on the ground are already noticing the shift. In DIFC, space is getting snapped up faster than it comes to market. In Al Quoz, dusty warehouses nobody wanted five years ago are suddenly hot property. And in neighborhoods like JVC and Arjan, retail clusters next to new communities are booked out before the paint dries.

So, the real decision for investors this year isn‚Äôt whether Dubai is worth buying into, it‚Äôs whether you‚Äôd rather hustle for tenants in the crowded residential playground, or quietly sit back collecting rent from an office or warehouse in a market where demand is outpacing supply.

So I think I killed my Melitta coffee machine, but I hope you could share some tips to get it back to life!

I‚Äôve done a deep clean yesterday after 7 years of using the machine. I took off covers from the back, top and sides. I partially dismantled the front panel as well (without disconnecting pipes). Cleaned everything I could reach. I was really careful to keep all internal cables connected, and if I had to disconnect them I took pictures to ensure I know how to plug them back. I was happy with the results, until I plugged it back to mains.
It doesn‚Äôt turn on. After pushing the power button it just remain silent. The display is dark, you can‚Äôt hear any movement inside. I did check the power is going to the board, but that‚Äôs all I could test. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs any of the sensor, as otherwise it would give some sort of alert. Here it looks like dead.

What started as a small side project for my personal use turned out to be a good tool for the users of immich, I've been hearing stories of how some of you organised your library so quick with IPT and also sharing it with others, I feel so grateful and immensely happy about it, can't wait to contribute more to this project and help the immich community which helped me a lot in preserving my memories :D

The project has hit a million downloads, I'm sure this is after a lot of duplicate pulls and upgrades, but still feels quite exiting for me to see this number less than a year. Thank you everyone for trying the project.

Also do share your stories if the power tools helped you and also if you have any horror stories if it has messed up, would be helpful for improvements and also come usescase for my own usage.

If you'd like to contribute to the project, please do raise a PR or share your feedback/feature request in [Github Project ](https://github.com/varun-raj/immich-power-tools)or in the [Feedback Portal](https://immich-power-tools.featureos.app/)

If you'd like to support the project, I'd love to get coffees from you :D [https://buymeacoffee.com/varunraj](https://buymeacoffee.com/varunraj)

And, I've started exporing on the automations and workflows, I know Immich is working on it, but I'm trying more of deeper use cases (I hope it will be useful and powerful than native implementation). Just stuck in getting the signals from Immich (planning to go with interval based polling for now).

This is certainly exciting guys!

Hey folks, it‚Äôs me again,  
During the process of building **""Clipboard Manager Pro""** (http://clipboard.extensionbooster.com/), I ran into some pretty fun moments, so I‚Äôm bringing them here to share with you all.

# Motivation to Build the Extension

At first, I made this extension mostly because I found other clipboard extensions quite **‚Äúhard to use.‚Äù** I‚Äôve always been a heavy Clipboard Manager user. So I thought, *why not just build one the way I like it*‚Äîclassic builder syndrome.  
But then I started wondering: ‚ÄúWait, why do those extensions, which are ugly and hard to use, have tons of users‚Äîeven paying big bucks?‚Äù I figured maybe I needed to build one myself to really see the problem.  
‚Üí Then I realized: ah, they were **the pioneers**. That‚Äôs why!

# Releasing the MVP

Alright, so I coded it out‚Äîgot quite a bit of help from Claude, and since I use this kind of tool daily, it went pretty smoothly. Initially, I only planned to let Claude help me code the extension and the backend server. But then I realized: *this thing actually understands more than me, why not let it build the landing page too?* So I did.

Release was pretty smooth‚Äîpublish to store, post to groups, do some seeding.  
Got a few dozen users. Good signals, I got excited. Added more features here and there, waiting for ‚Äúthe magic‚Äù to happen.

# After the MVP Release

After 2‚Äì3 weeks, the media buzz faded. Posts got buried, users in the community started forgetting about me. I kept adding new features, tried ‚Äúsharing‚Äù in new ways, but new users only came in small trickles.

So I thought: *hard work beats smart work.* I added more features, redesigned the UI to make it easier, threw in shortcut hotkeys‚Äîbasically just guessing what users wanted. Features kept increasing, users fluctuated. Not good. I was starting to burn out.

# Magic #1

The old intro post was still there, not deleted, not reposted. Every day, I still checked analytics to see new users and churn: +2, +5, -2, -10‚Ä¶

Then one day, I saw a new signup with an amazon email. And they were using it actively. Holy crap‚Äîmy crappy extension, noticed and trusted by someone at Amazon? Maybe they installed by mistake? Or was it a fake email? But no‚ÄîI had verification, not easy to fake. Their workload kept increasing, proving they were actually using it.

That gave me some spirit back.

# Obstacle #1

Of course, joy never lasts forever. Once things looked promising, I tried posting to other groups/communities. But you know how it is: making a clipboard extension with **device sync** means people immediately worry about ‚Äúsensitive data.‚Äù

Like: *‚ÄúHey man, if you sync across devices, but don‚Äôt send it to a server, how do you sync? Cry emoji. Please understand that if you want end-to-end encryption, you‚Äôll run out of time and money.‚Äù*  
Luckily, that guy calmed down after my explanation.

Another obstacle: competitors noticed me popping up, so they crushed me with ads. Instead of burning money on ads, I figured: just wait for them to run out of budget. =))

# Solution to Obstacle #1

Users are picky‚Äîlike trying to please women, haha. So I built **two modes**:

* **Online mode:** syncs like normal.
* **Offline mode:** data stays only on local, nothing sent to the server, only an identifier when logging in.

Good enough. Users were satisfied.

# Magic #2

Another sunny day, I was analyzing user data over morning coffee. Saw some **enterprise emails** (ABC company). Wait‚Äîenterprise users using this too?

Filtered deeper, found a whole batch of users sharing the same corporate domain. So not only were they using it, they were even **recommending it to colleagues.** Pretty fun. Seems like *good karma pays off.*

Maybe I should add some B2B-friendly features. Still thinking‚Ä¶

# Lessons Learned

Turns out, whether big or small, simple or complex, there will always be users who need your tool. The key is scratching the right itch.

Problems will always exist‚Äîthe only way is to find solutions, not avoid them. Treat users well, and they‚Äôll love you back.

I once thought I had to study ABCXYZ before doing anything. But nope‚Äîjust jump in. If it doesn‚Äôt work horizontally, it‚Äôll work vertically.

Oh, and don‚Äôt be afraid of criticism. If people complain, it‚Äôs because they care enough to use it. That‚Äôs how you learn.

# Closing

This rambling has gone on long enough. Hopefully, **Clipboard Manager Pro** lives long enough to help more people optimize productivity in small ways‚Äîand give me more funny stories to share with you all.

A short story, but a long journey. Thanks for reading this messy tale. See you in the next one!

Ah‚Äîalmost forgot. The real purpose of this post is to ‚ÄúMARKET‚Äù my extension, haha. Got too caught up in storytelling. üòÖ It‚Äôs called **Clipboard Manager Pro -** [**http://clipboard.extensionbooster.com/**](http://clipboard.extensionbooster.com/), link in the comments below.

Referral Code: AYLGY54DAG

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24‚Äì48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.

* [During¬†**plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and¬†red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to¬†track donations across centers; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your¬†**overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.

1. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

1. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. Caffeine is a mild diuretic and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.

1. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.

1. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

1. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq)¬†via normal tissue healing.

1. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what‚Äôs called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

1. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

1. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).

* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.

* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).

* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.

* Taking vitamin and mineral supplements (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. Protein shakes¬†before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

1. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24‚Äì48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.

* [During¬†**plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and¬†red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to¬†track donations across centers; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your¬†**overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.

1. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

1. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. Caffeine is a mild diuretic and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.

1. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.

1. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

1. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq)¬†via normal tissue healing.

1. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what‚Äôs called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

1. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

1. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).

* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.

* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).

* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.

* Taking vitamin and mineral supplements (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. Protein shakes¬†before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

1. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

1. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

1n0j3ai,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_scribleg/comments/1n0j3ai/never_nangabit_pero_masisira_yung_5_yr/,Never nangabit pero masisira yung 5 yr relationship namin because of gambling,"P.s: Mejo mahaba to.

I don‚Äôt know how to put all these together. But i ruined our relationship because i‚Äôm a gamble addict. I‚Äôm F, currently living in bacolod. Originally, i‚Äôm from Region 2. But because of love, i choose to relocate in Bacolod and live with my partner, btw we‚Äôre a queer couple.

To cut the story short. Our relationship is now under the brick kasi lagi akong nagsusugal ng patago, pero eventually lagi rin niyang nabubuko.

Yung pera na sinusugal ko lately was her hard earned money from freelancing. I don‚Äôt contribute a single penny sa kung magkano man ang pera na meron kami.

Life update, we had a small business, pero nagstop muna kami sa magulong rason rin. Basically we were figuring out how to survive on a daily basis sa freelancing gig namin. Yung client ko siya nagsusulat btw. 

So ayun, hindi naman stranger sa kanya yung pagsusugal ko. It all started as pantanggal boredom, minsan nga we both do it for fun. Eventually though, my fond of gambling turned into a necessity. 

Let me explain. Before ako lumipat sa bacolod, i worked as a manager sa isang financial company. (Yup, may background sa finance pero bobo sa pera) But then nataggal ako, for some fucked up reason. So, my girl introduced me to freelancing. She was smart, super smart. Binigay niya sakin yung first client niya. Cause she had more than 1 at that time. I was new to the freelancing world. As a newbie, she patiently teaches me how to do the job done. 

Until we decided that what if i should move there so it‚Äôll be easier for me to transition from corpo to wfh with her help. Pero para lang talaga mas malapit kami sa isa‚Äôt-isa. We were ldr for like a year or two ata. 

We built our small snack/coffee shop, all while continuing the freelancing gig. The agreement was, siya hands on sa clients namin, while ako sa business. 

But then, yun nga nagstop kami, i‚Äôm not gonna detail everything. Basta, we ran away from their house. Without savings. 

Yung kita ng business namin was just enough to cover our daily expenses. Nga pala, ang pera niya ay pera ko. That‚Äôs what she always say. Legit na mas malaki kita namin sa freelancing than what our business is earning. 

Pero as a previous bread winner. I‚Äôm not comfortable with the set up. She earned it, pinagpuyatan niya yun. Utak niya yun.  So kahit sabihin niyang ‚Äúpera namin‚Äù yun. Laging nasa utak ko, sa kanya yun. Tiyaka, di naman kami mag asawa. So, i set the bounderies. 

I had needs. My family had needs, especially my mom. Since we started our biz, i stopped earning as well. Nasira laptop ko. Idagdag mo pa na wala talaga ako time magsulat since ang biz ay mostly nakatoka sakin. That‚Äôs when gambling started to feel like a necessity. 

May mga utang ako at si mama na need ko bayaran. Yung maintenance ni mama na dapat weekly ako magbigay. My sisters weren‚Äôt capable to help as of now. I can‚Äôt just tell my girl na ‚Äúhey, need ko bayaran si ganito‚Äù, ‚Äúneed ni mama ng gamot‚Äù. From time to time, nagpapadala ako kay mama galing sa freelance gig pag sumahod na. She‚Äôs the one hesitating na magpadala ako and i really appreciate it. 

I remember when i first won. It was an easy money. And that was the trap.

Ang ironic rin kasi halos ayoko tumanggap from her pero when it comes to gambling, i can gamble that money easily.

One time, I gambled our supposed to be inventory money. That‚Äôs when I started to lie. I was so scared kasi san ako kukuha ng kapalit. I had nothing. I lied na pinadala ko bla blah, but then sabi ko nga, nabubuko ako.

It happend twice, thrice, and now the last one. Her last straw.

At first, I had her permission to play, but when she told me to stop. I couldn‚Äôt. Kaya lately, kapag tulog na siya saka ako maglalaro. 

It hurts me kasi lagi niyang iniisip na kaloko loko raw ba siya. Kasi pangkain na lang namin ngayon isusugal ko pa. Pag nananalo ako sinesend ko lang sa pamilya ko, then siya na sumasalo sa lahat. She told me I was dragging her down. And she was right. Hearing those words from her mouth was unbearable. 

I can‚Äôt blame her. She was right all along. 

I don‚Äôt want to lie. But it was a choice that i had to make. 

At di sila nagkakamali. You reap what you sow. I was having panic attacks everytime nagsisinungaling ako. Ayoko magsinungaling, pero i had to. To protect my personal gains and our relationship. Pano ko sasabihin na need ko magtake ng risks sa sugal kasi need ni mama ng gamot, na may due date akong need bayaran. We weren‚Äôt earning much lately. Binitawan niya kasi yung mga high paying clients niya noon para magfocus sa biz. So yung mga natira are small paying clients.

‚ÄúBat di ka na lang kasi magwork.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt have a laptop. Neither a phone. That‚Äôs how broke i am. It‚Äôs a shared laptop if i wanted to work. But the set up won‚Äôt work with us.

I feel sorry and guilty. More than she can imagine. She never lied to me, never. Kaya i don‚Äôt blame her. She had all the right na magalit sakin. Nung natalo ako kanina, I knew this would happen. That we might broke up. I was scared. I literally can‚Äôt breathe. 

But here I am, writing this long ass story. Instead of an apology letter. 

Baby, if makita mo man to. I‚Äôm really really sorry. I don‚Äôt wanna lose you. Pero i did it to us. Kaya i would totally understand if ayaw mo na. P.S: you‚Äôre wrong. I love you more than you love me.

1n0j1es,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForceTech/comments/1n0j1es/examine_the_best_gaming_keyboard_magegee_sky81/,Examine the Best Gaming Keyboard MageGee SKY81 Worth the Hype,"Testing out the MageGee SKY81 mechanical gaming keyboard every day has been a fascinating journey for a tech enthusiast like me. When I first got my hands on it, I immediately noticed the compact, 75% layout boasting just 83 keys, which significantly minimizes the keyboard's footprint while retaining essential functionality. For someone like me, who constantly juggles between gaming and work tasks, it offers a fantastic blend of aesthetics and practicality.

**Design and Build Quality**

The design screams premium at a glance. The dreamy sky color scheme combines whimsical aesthetics with a professional edge, making it versatile enough for both office use and gaming setups. The heat-sublimated keycaps feature intricate patterns that I found visually delightful‚Äîespecially for long gaming nights or workdays. With the gasket-mounted structure, this keyboard is crafted to reduce vibrations and noise through strategically placed gaskets, enhancing typing comfort and keystroke consistency. It‚Äôs not entirely silent, but the sound is subtle and satisfying, even during those furious late-night gaming sessions.

**Gasket-Mount Structure and Sound Absorption**

Typing on this keyboard has been an oddly satisfying experience. The built-in five-layer sound-absorbing components, including IXPE foam pads and silicone dampers, make a noticeable difference. I‚Äôve owned plenty of mechanical keyboards, and they often have a hollow sound‚Äîthis one does not. Whether it's writing emails or spamming spells in an MMORPG, the cushioned feedback and softened acoustic tones genuinely stand out.

**Pluses**

- Tri-mode connectivity (BT 5.0, 2.4 GHz, wired)  
- Exceptional sound dampening with foam and silicone layers  
- Compact yet retains full functionality  
- Customizable lighting with 18 unique RGB modes  

[Check MageGee SKY81 price on Amazon.](https://headphonegeek.com/p/b0d2nw4g41/)

**Performance and Connectivity**

The MageGee SKY81 offers three modes of connectivity: wired, wireless 2.4G, and Bluetooth 5.0. Switching between devices with the onboard toggle has been seamless, and I‚Äôve been able to quickly alternate between my gaming PC and work laptop with ease. It‚Äôs a relief to switch connection modes this efficiently, especially during Zoom meetings or while transitioning to a fast-paced FPS game. The highlight, however, is MageGee‚Äôs use of a 3000 mAh battery that keeps the keyboard running for over a dozen hours on a single charge when the RGB lighting is enabled. 

For someone who uses the keyboard almost as much as my coffee mug, it‚Äôs pleasing to know that battery anxiety won‚Äôt kick in halfway through my day. Recharging is also convenient with the included USB-C cable.

**Positives**

- Impressively long battery life with 3000 mAh capacity  
- Can connect to up to five devices simultaneously  
- Anti-ghosting ensures zero missed keystrokes during intense gaming  

**Hot-Swappable Switches and Customization**

Being someone who loves to tinker with tech, I was elated to find the hot-swappable functionality. You‚Äôre not stuck with the pre-installed MageGee Violet switches (which are pre-lubed, by the way). Though I‚Äôve grown to appreciate the creamy and responsive typing/tactile feel they provide, being able to swap them with any 3-pin or 5-pin compatible switches is a major plus. Customizing your keyboard based on your typing style has never been easier‚Äîespecially for gamers or typists who demand precise keystroke actions.

**Drawbacks**

- Lack of software for finer RGB and key remapping customizations  
- Slightly hefty for a compact keyboard at 2.27 pounds  

**Multifunctional Knob**

The metal knob on the top-right corner immediately caught my attention. Navigating your keyboard lights and music with just a knob is a welcome feature. Adjusting volume or switching backlight effects by rotating or pressing the knob feels intuitive, and it didn‚Äôt take long to integrate it into my daily routine. As someone who‚Äôs always multitasking, features like this go a long way.

**Competing Brands**

After spending hours with the MageGee SKY81, I couldn't help comparing it with a few competitors such as the Keychron K6 and the Royal Kludge RK84. While the SKY81 matches the Keychron K6 in terms of build quality and compactness, it edges it out with better sound-dampening capabilities and pre-lubed switches. However, the Keychron family offers more robust software support for key remapping, which the SKY81 lacks. Similarly, the Royal Kludge RK84 offers slightly better affordability but doesn‚Äôt match the premium feel or sound of the SKY81. The choice boils down to your priorities‚Äîwhether you seek premium sound absorption or extensive software customization.

**Value Assessment**

The price-to-quality ratio for the MageGee SKY81 feels justified. While it leans toward a premium segment, the features it offers‚Äîfive-layer sound absorption, gasket-mounted comfort, a sturdy build, and robust connectivity‚Äîcertainly make it worth the investment. It‚Äôs perfect for both gamers and professionals who prioritize performance and usability over glamour. Sure, competing keyboards provide certain features at slightly lower prices, but the seamless typing, tactile response, and durability here make this keyboard a reliable long-term companion.

And honestly DoorDash has been f***ing sh*t recently. My order history in the last month or two has been the following, delivered by different people. And all orders are small or one bag for a $3-4 tip. 
(Not far drive, we just don‚Äôt have transportation and it‚Äôs been too hot to cook) 

McDonald‚Äôs order? Open bag, refunded with credits. 
Starbucks order? Opened bag, missing brownie. Full refund in credits 
KFC order? Cancelled by driver then by KFC and DD kfc was turned to closed 
Starbucks order? Missing brownie, given card to ask DD for refund. DD refuses, I dispute it with an appeal and it was denied ($5 brownie)


And yesterday? Tim Hortons order. Door dash driver double delivered and gave our Tim‚Äôs bag to a woman who ordered Tacos from a local taco place by a different app (skip the dishes) She opened our bag for some reason.  Made a report, showed the very heavily ripped open bag. Refunded only $15 credits out of a $50+ order.

[The List of Critical Minerals informs investments in mining activities and the recovery of resources from mine waste and stockpiles. Credit: BJP7images\/Shutterstock.com.](https://preview.redd.it/8bk6zo4d6clf1.png?width=770&format=png&auto=webp&s=f21ee2617426795cbb747274a931668de8331ffa)

The US Department of the Interior (DoI), through the US Geological Survey (USGS), has released the draft 2025 List of Critical Minerals along with a report detailing a new framework for evaluating how potential disruptions in the supply chain might impact the US economy.

The draft list will serve as a guide for federal strategies, investments and permitting decisions aimed at securing the minerals essential for driving the US economy and safeguarding national security.

The List of Critical Minerals informs investments in mining activities and the recovery of resources from mine waste and stockpiles.

It also supports tax incentives for mineral processing in the US and facilitates a more efficient permitting process for mining operations.

The 2025 draft list comprises 54 mineral commodities, of which 50 were selected based on the findings of the economic impact assessment.

Zirconium was added due to concerns regarding a potential single point of failure in the domestic supply chain, while three others were kept based on qualitative analysis.

Copper, lead, potash, rhenium, silicon and silver were recommended for inclusion, while arsenic and tellurium were suggested for removal.

This update marks the second iteration of the List of Critical Minerals, which originated from a 2017 Executive Order by President Donald Trump.

This order initiated an analysis of the vulnerabilities within supply chains for critical minerals. The Energy Act of 2020 further established a process for updating the list every three years.

Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said: ‚ÄúPresident Trump has made clear that strengthening America‚Äôs economic and national security means securing the resources that fuel our way of life.

‚ÄúThis draft List of Critical Minerals provides a clear, science-based road map to reduce our dependence on foreign adversaries, expand domestic production and unleash American innovation.‚Äù

The supply chain disruption model evaluated more than 1,200 trade disruption scenarios involving 84 mineral commodities and their potential effects on 402 individual industries and the overall US economy.

The economic impacts were weighted by the probability of each disruption scenario occurring.

The top ten mineral commodities, ranked by the estimated probability-weighted impact of supply disruptions on the US economy are dysprosium, gadolinium, gallium, germanium, lutetium, niobium, rhodium, samarium, terbium and tungsten.

The new USGS methodology allows policymakers to evaluate risks across multiple scenarios for all 84 mineral commodities analysed, providing a clear economic measure that can be compared directly to other national priorities and risk-mitigation strategies.

Under the Energy Act, Secretary Burgum has the authority to designate additional minerals for inclusion in the final list.

Metallurgical coal and uranium are among those referred for consideration, and the USGS plans to analyse their potential inclusion in the 2025 List of Critical Minerals.

In July, the DoI began taking significant measures¬†[to extract critical minerals from mining by-products](https://www.mining-technology.com/news/us-mine-waste-critical-minerals/), which are crucial for the nation‚Äôs economic stability, defence capabilities and energy prospects.

It is focusing on the extraction of uranium and various other minerals from disused mines and has instructed the USGS to catalogue and assess federal mine waste locations.

*China distorts global markets for critical minerals through subsidies, export controls, and price manipulation, threatening U.S. and allied industry. Drawing lessons from stockpiles in history, we propose establishing a U.S.-led multilateral critical minerals stockpile (MCS), implemented by regulated private operators.*

China distorts global markets for critical minerals through subsidies, export controls, and price manipulation, threatening U.S. and allied industry. Drawing lessons from stockpiles in history, we propose establishing a U.S.-led multilateral critical minerals stockpile (MCS), implemented by regulated private operators. The goals are to stabilize the commercial market during times of geopolitical stress and facilitate the creation and sustainment of liquid spot markets for more of these minerals.¬†

**The proposed MCS will:**¬†

1. Stockpile at least 12 months of peacetime demand for the critical minerals with industrial uses that are most vulnerable to supply chain disruptions from China.¬†
2. Purchase these minerals under normal market conditions and store them on federal land and/or in allied countries.¬†
3. Disperse minerals into the commercial market when China‚Äôs actions spike prices or disrupt supply.¬†

The existence of such a mechanism would mitigate the coercive leverage China enjoys over the United States and its allies thanks to its control of mineral supply chains. The paper proposes a detailed schematic concept for broader discussion and possible implementation.¬†

*IMHO:*

***NioCorp‚Äôs Elk Creek Project is rapidly emerging as a flagship U.S. source of critical minerals, aligning uniquely with national priorities in defense, energy, and industrial resilience.*** *With Phase 1 drilling complete and a Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS) expected in Q4 2025, the project sits at the intersection of federal backing, resource demand, and capital market readiness. Key catalysts include a $10M DoD grant, EXIM Bank fast-tracking, and alignment with strategic initiatives like the DOD‚Äôs SMR/DPA Critical Minerals Hub, the DOE‚Äôs $1B critical minerals fund, and potential CHIPS Act funding.*

***\*\*\*The 2025 USGS draft rankings now place three of NioCorp‚Äôs core products in the Top 10 most critical minerals, underscoring Elk Creek‚Äôs strategic importance. This, combined with NioCorp‚Äôs vertical ambitions in scandium alloys and rare earth magnet production, positions the project as one of the most strategically critical undeveloped mineral assets in the U.S.***

***Despite a temporary quiet period before updated drill results***\*, NioCorp‚Äôs vertically integrated model and supply chain relevance may attract anchor investors post-DFS ‚Äî including potential OEMs or federal partners. As reshoring and critical mineral independence become top U.S. priorities, NioCorp‚Äôs ability to deliver multiple top-ranked minerals, pursue value-added processing (e.g., scandium-aluminum alloys), and integrate future rare earth recycling makes it a central player in the race for American resource independence by 2028 and beyond.\*

Hey folks, it‚Äôs me again,  
During the process of building **""Clipboard Manager Pro""** (http://clipboard.extensionbooster.com/), I ran into some pretty fun moments, so I‚Äôm bringing them here to share with you all.

# Motivation to Build the Extension

At first, I made this extension mostly because I found other clipboard extensions quite **‚Äúhard to use.‚Äù** I‚Äôve always been a heavy Clipboard Manager user. So I thought, *why not just build one the way I like it*‚Äîclassic builder syndrome.  
But then I started wondering: ‚ÄúWait, why do those extensions, which are ugly and hard to use, have tons of users‚Äîeven paying big bucks?‚Äù I figured maybe I needed to build one myself to really see the problem.  
‚Üí Then I realized: ah, they were **the pioneers**. That‚Äôs why!

# Releasing the MVP

Alright, so I coded it out‚Äîgot quite a bit of help from Claude, and since I use this kind of tool daily, it went pretty smoothly. Initially, I only planned to let Claude help me code the extension and the backend server. But then I realized: *this thing actually understands more than me, why not let it build the landing page too?* So I did.

Release was pretty smooth‚Äîpublish to store, post to groups, do some seeding.  
Got a few dozen users. Good signals, I got excited. Added more features here and there, waiting for ‚Äúthe magic‚Äù to happen.

# After the MVP Release

After 2‚Äì3 weeks, the media buzz faded. Posts got buried, users in the community started forgetting about me. I kept adding new features, tried ‚Äúsharing‚Äù in new ways, but new users only came in small trickles.

So I thought: *hard work beats smart work.* I added more features, redesigned the UI to make it easier, threw in shortcut hotkeys‚Äîbasically just guessing what users wanted. Features kept increasing, users fluctuated. Not good. I was starting to burn out.

# Magic #1

The old intro post was still there, not deleted, not reposted. Every day, I still checked analytics to see new users and churn: +2, +5, -2, -10‚Ä¶

Then one day, I saw a new signup with an **amazon** email. And they were using it actively. Holy crap‚Äîmy crappy extension, noticed and trusted by someone at Amazon? Maybe they installed by mistake? Or was it a fake email? But no‚ÄîI had verification, not easy to fake. Their workload kept increasing, proving they were actually using it.

That gave me some spirit back.

# Obstacle #1

Of course, joy never lasts forever. Once things looked promising, I tried posting to other groups/communities. But you know how it is: making a clipboard extension with **device sync** means people immediately worry about ‚Äúsensitive data.‚Äù

Like: *‚ÄúHey man, if you sync across devices, but don‚Äôt send it to a server, how do you sync? Cry emoji. Please understand that if you want end-to-end encryption, you‚Äôll run out of time and money.‚Äù*  
Luckily, that guy calmed down after my explanation.

Another obstacle: competitors noticed me popping up, so they crushed me with ads. Instead of burning money on ads, I figured: just wait for them to run out of budget. =))

# Solution to Obstacle #1

Users are picky‚Äîlike trying to please women, haha. So I built **two modes**:

* **Online mode:** syncs like normal.
* **Offline mode:** data stays only on local, nothing sent to the server, only an identifier when logging in.

Good enough. Users were satisfied.

# Magic #2

Another sunny day, I was analyzing user data over morning coffee. Saw some **enterprise emails** (ABC company). Wait‚Äîenterprise users using this too?

Filtered deeper, found a whole batch of users sharing the same corporate domain. So not only were they using it, they were even **recommending it to colleagues.** Pretty fun. Seems like *good karma pays off.*

Maybe I should add some B2B-friendly features. Still thinking‚Ä¶

# Lessons Learned

Turns out, whether big or small, simple or complex, there will always be users who need your tool. The key is scratching the right itch.

Problems will always exist‚Äîthe only way is to find solutions, not avoid them. Treat users well, and they‚Äôll love you back.

I once thought I had to study ABCXYZ before doing anything. But nope‚Äîjust jump in. If it doesn‚Äôt work horizontally, it‚Äôll work vertically.

Oh, and don‚Äôt be afraid of criticism. If people complain, it‚Äôs because they care enough to use it. That‚Äôs how you learn.

# Closing

This rambling has gone on long enough. Hopefully, **Clipboard Manager Pro** lives long enough to help more people optimize productivity in small ways‚Äîand give me more funny stories to share with you all.

A short story, but a long journey. Thanks for reading this messy tale. See you in the next one!

Ah‚Äîalmost forgot. The real purpose of this post is to ‚ÄúMARKET‚Äù my extension, haha. Got too caught up in storytelling. üòÖ It‚Äôs called **Clipboard Manager Pro** http://clipboard.extensionbooster.com/.

i met this friend in high school last year and we decided to be roommates. i was fine with it because we aren‚Äôt super close friends (just friendish classmates) and we seem to have pretty similar lifestyles. 

for context, im an introvert and have never had arguments or issues with any friends or classmates so im very inexperienced with standing my ground in friendships. i also never found it necessary to stand my ground in light conversation bc usually the other person just wants to talk(and that‚Äôs ok!). 

after a couple of months of living together and talking, i realized that they often lightly argue with me over opinions or random facts and is very persistent about their own experiences/feelings. i often find myself agreeing with what they said, letting them take the last word, listen to their rants, listening to how someone did them wrong, how ppl are racist or disrespectful towards them, etc. they would also occasionally ‚Äúvaguely‚Äù compare themselves to me. they also tell me a lot of their previous experiences where someone else always compare themselves to them and they found it funny (but also compare themselves to me so I‚Äôm confused why you care so much if u do it too?). i have heard so much of that person talking about themselves that if i hear it again ill literally go crazy. the first few times i respected them bc they hv the confidence and it‚Äôs def something we should all learn but at some point it becomes somewhat like flexing (but they‚Äôre also insecure they literally said it to me). they also try to bind us together so i kept having to answer them where im going and that we should go together. we used to share snap location but i stopped bc they kept stalking me (not a problem since i shared) and asking me where i am and what im doing‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ 

it was pretty recent when i realized that this is not right. i started to feel SO compared to, so small, so powerless, and honestly so annoyed. i have never let people or friends get to me because i always look at the bright side of them but this time it went too far to the point i accidentally rolled my eyes facing away from them when they kept passively bragging about themselves or arguing their side to me one time. rolling my eyes is so mean and as much as i hated our interaction, i would definitely hold myself back from doing it next time. but overall, they are a good friend and a kind person. there are a lot of positives of this person that i look up to and respect but i don‚Äôt think im ok with all the prev behavior and how they make me feel.  

the point is: i became a bit more quiet (if that even is possible) for a few days and ran my errands on my own. i woke up early to go get some alone time in my labs and came back a bit later than usual bc of hw. it triggered them. yep. i am also so passively manipulated by them that im literally on reddit rn feeling like im an evil friend for being distant for a day or two. 

edit: im gonna add more things that happened that I found weird as I try to recall them. maybe it‚Äôs weird or maybe I‚Äôm weird for thinking it‚Äôs weird pls lmk i wanna be a better person

- they immediately looked up the clubs and positions i was applying for and looked into what i applied for and looks at what they can apply for (we are completely diff majors‚Ä¶.) 
- every time i have a coffee chat with clubs or any career advancement, it triggers them into their career grind
- mentions a lot about my culture and likes my hometowns
- vaguely talks down abt my ‚Äúprivilege‚Äù but literally loves where I‚Äôm from

1n0iyxi,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewVoyage/comments/1n0iyxi/why_is_stanley_carpet_spot_remover_gaining_so/,Why Is Stanley Carpet Spot Remover Gaining So Many Rave Reviews,"Testing out the Stanley Steemer Professional Carpet and Upholstery Spot Remover in my daily life felt like a practical approach to tackling the mishaps that inevitably occur in a busy household. The 32-ounce container seemed like a fair amount to test on various surfaces in my home, ranging from the plush living room carpet to the occasional couch spills that my kids seem too keen on creating. I‚Äôll admit, I‚Äôve had my fair share of skepticism about carpet cleaners in the past, wondering if they live up to their claims of ‚Äúremoving most common stains‚Äù‚Äîbut this product gave me a chance to find out.

**Ease of Use and Versatility**  
The spot remover is straightforward to use. All I needed was a quick spritz on the affected area, let it sit for a few seconds, and then blot the spot with a clean cloth. Its versatility amazed me‚Äîit successfully tackled a juice stain the dog wasn‚Äôt kind enough to ignore, a lipstick smear that mysteriously ended up on the couch, and even the dreaded coffee splashes on the carpet that I thought were permanent. The product claims it removes or improves stains like blood, candy, chewing gum, chocolate, pet accidents, and more, and I‚Äôd have to agree. It felt like an all-in-one weapon for everyday accidents.

**Performance at Stain Removal**  
Admittedly, what stood out most was how effectively it removed tough marks without much elbow grease. In one instance, a chewing gum stain that had been stuck to one of the car upholstery seats for weeks showed visible improvement after just two uses. Another stubborn coffee stain that had dried on my carpet lifted substantially after one treatment. With consistent use, I felt the results were highly satisfactory for most spots.

**Ready to snag Stanley Steemer Professional Carpet and Upholstery Spot Remover? [Click here for Amazon pricing.](https://blog.sanue.com/p/b001aa3q1o/)**  

**Highlights**  
- Tackles a variety of stains, from pet accidents to food and drink spills.  
- Quick and easy application process.  
- Works effectively on both carpets and upholstery.  
- Large 32-ounce bottle gives plenty of product to work with.

**Scent and Residue**  
Oddly enough, I was surprised by the mild coffee-like fragrance. Unlike some overpowering cleaning chemicals, this scent was pleasant, but it dissipates fairly quickly. Even if you don‚Äôt enjoy the aroma, rest assured it won‚Äôt linger for long. Additionally, the cleaner didn‚Äôt leave behind any sticky residue, which has been an issue with some previous products I‚Äôve used. This was a relief, especially on my living room couch, where I don‚Äôt want lingering chemicals or odors.

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Struggles a bit with older, deeply set stains.   
- Could be more effective on certain oily spots without requiring multiple applications.   

**Alternative Offerings**  
Looking around, I‚Äôve worked with other well-known spot cleaners like Resolve and Folex in the past. While Folex has the edge in speed and minimal effort with stain lifting, it doesn‚Äôt leave as pleasant a scent as this cleaner, nor does it handle such a wide array of stains with the same consistency. On the other hand, Resolve performs well but can leave slightly soapy traces on dense carpets if not meticulously cleaned away. For this spot remover, I‚Äôd say it stands out in terms of its overall user experience and its ability to improve challenging marks without tiring effort from me.

**Value for Money**  
Pricewise, it slots itself reasonably for the scope it covers. Knowing how versatile the product is gives it definite value over more specific or limited-use cleaners. It‚Äôs not something that feels like an extravagance, but rather a much-needed tool in the arsenal of a well-lived home. Budget-conscious shoppers would probably find it hard to argue against the overall performance.

1n0ivq8,https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/1n0ivq8/a_coffee_shop_date/,A Coffee Shop Date,"One spring morning, when the children were at Hogwarts and the work was slow and the day was bright, Hermione said, 'do you want to go to a coffee shop?'

Hermione did not think of herself as a particularly girly woman. She liked herself for her intelligence, and her tenacity, and her sharpness and wit, and she liked to think that made her not the sort to be fond of heels, or make-up, or dresses, or dates, though she admitted she did indeed like those things, and wished she was better at them. But lately the weather had been so nice, and it had set all her friends and co-workers in a lovely romantic mood, and they would whisper and giggle to each other about the wonderful time they had spent out yesterday with their husbands and boyfriends out in coffee shops and shopping streets. And lately Hermione would hear all these things and look out the window, at the beautiful spring atmosphere (or a close approximation of it, since the Ministry was underground) and think that perhaps heels and make-up and dresses and dates were not such a bad idea.

Ron, standing at the counter, turned around in surprise. 'What's brought this on?'

'Oh,' said Hermione, who had not prepared for this perhaps reasonable line of questioning, 'well, it's just been so nice out, and since we're both free I thought we could enjoy it.'

'I guess it has been,' Ron agreed. 'And I guess we could.'

'So should we?'

'What, today?' said Ron, surprised again.

'Well, not today,' Hermione said hastily. 'We could go out tomorrow. Or next week.'

'Let's go today if you want to,' Ron said. 'Before the weather goes out. I don't have anything to do today anyway. Do you?'

'No,' said Hermione. 'Alright, let's go today.'

'Where should we go?' asked Ron.

Hermione had not thought about this. To be quite frank with herself, as much as she could be, Hermione was not entirely sure if this was even a good idea, and was a little surprised that Ron had taken it on so easily.

'I don't know,' Hermione admitted. 'Maybe we could go to Madam Puddifoot's.'

'With all the teenagers?'

'Alright, maybe not Madam Puddifoot's,' Hermione relented. 'But I don't know any other places.'

'There's a place in Diagon Alley we could go to,' said Ron. 'It's all blue and white. Something-coffee, I forgot the name.'

'It's always very loud, isn't it?' said Hermione. 'Would it really be fun?'

'I guess not,' said Ron. 'Where should we go, then?'

They both considered it.

'There's a place nearby,' Hermione said slowly. 'Near the square...'

'A Muggle shop?' asked Ron.

'We could find a wizarding shop,' said Hermione

'No, I want to go,' said Ron. 'It's been a while since I went to a Muggle shop. And it'd be nice, to walk somewhere close.'

'Alright,' Hermione said. 'But I don't know if we have any money for it.'

'I can go to Gringotts and get some today,' said Ron. 'Let's go to a Muggle place. It'll be fun.'

'Alright,' said Hermione again, and smiled. 'Let's go to a Muggle place.'

So it was that morning passed, and afternoon came, and Ron left and returned with paper notes, and Hermione stood in front of her mirror, wearing heels and make-up and a dress.

'You look lovely, dear,' said the mirror.

'Thank you, I suppose,' said Hermione. She ran her fingers over her hair, dismayed a little by how frizzy it was.

Ron opened the door just then. He looked her up and down, impressed.

'You look fantastic,' he said.

'Thank you,' Hermione repeated. Ron was in an old orange shirt, one with a cannon on it, and he had on a jacket over that, and he was wearing faded jeans and worn boots alongside that. He looked quite nice, and quite Ron, and Hermione thought she liked it very much.

'Should we go?' said Ron. He held out his hand, but Hermione didn't take it.

'My hair,' she said, a little upset. She ran her fingers over it again. She did not often think about her hair, but in her nice dress she could not help but feel a little self-conscious.

'It's such a mess,' she explained. 'I don't know what to do with it.'

'I like it when it's messy,' said Ron. 'And you look good. And it's only a coffee shop anyway, isn't it?'

'That's true,' admitted Hermione. 'I won't bother, then.' 

So she took Ron's hand and he led them out the door, down their garden, and into the Muggle street beyond, which was sunny and alive with people in their Muggle clothes and funny modern gadgets, and cars that cruised along the street with ease. Hermione wobbled a little on the uneven pavement, so Ron wrapped her arm around his and they went down to the square together, to the fountain that was broken more than it was fixed and the people walking their dogs under the shop signs and street lights.

'It's over here,' said Hermione. 'This place.' 

She led them to a little red shop sitting on the corner of the road, with wooden seats set out front and a plastic sign on top with a heart and a mug that said Warm at Heart. When they went inside they saw it was only the littlest bit busy, with a young couple next to the window giggling at each other, and another in the corner waiting for their order, and an old man in line waiting at the register, and a lone patron at the back who was typing on what must have been a computer, but it was a strange looking computer that Hermione had never seen and so supposed it was modern.

They went in line behind the old man. Ron took out the money he brought and thumbed through it. 

'You'll have to help me with the money,' he murmured. 'I don't know what any of these mean.'

'Look at the numbers in the corner,' said Hermione, leaning over to point at them. 'Just add those up to whatever we need.'

'Alright,' said Ron. He put the money back in his pocket and frowned at the menu instead. 'You might have to help me with my order, too,' he said. 'I've never seen these names.'

'Sure,' said Hermione, and looked up at the menu as well. If she was being honest with herself, which she always tried to be, she was really just as out of place as Ron. She did not frequent Muggle shops, if she frequented shops at all, and it seemed that in the meantime the selection of drinks that were offered had expanded into a number of items she did not know, so she decided simply to ignore them and look at the things she did know.

'I'll have a latte,' she said eventually. 'You could have a mocha.'

'Alright, I'll have a mocha,' said Ron. 'A latte and a mocha,' he told the cashier, since the old man had stepped out of line.

'Size?' said the cashier, without looking up.

'Oh, er...' said Ron, looking at Hermione uncertainly.

'Small latte, please,' said Hermione. 'And the mocha...?'

'Small as well, then,' said Ron. The cashier typed their order into the register and said, 'four pounds sixty.'

Ron gave him a five pound note, and they went to take a seat by the window where they could see the square outside, next to the giggling couple.

'It's been a while since we've been out like this, hasn't it?' said Ron, looking out the window.

'Yeah,' said Hermione. 'Not since Hugo was born, have we?'

'Long time,' Ron smiled. 'We picked a nice day for it, though, I reckon. I wish we'd picked a seat outside.'

'We could go there, you know,' offered Hermione.

'No,' said Ron, turning around to her. 'Here I can see you better.'

Hermione was so startled she couldn't help but laugh and blush. The cashier called out their order and Ron went to go get it, while Hermione looked around at him and then at the surrounding shop. The old man who was waiting in line had returned to a table where he was nursing his drink and talking to someone on what Hermione thought was a phone, but it didn't have any wires and so she assumed it was also modern. The couple sitting next to them was now kissing passionately, and Hermione quickly looked away.

Ron returned with a tray that held two cups and a packet of sugar. 'Make you remember, eh?' he said, nodding at the kissing couple, and laughed when Hermione flushed again. He sat down and took a sip of his mocha.

'Bit sweet, isn't it?' he said.

'It's supposed to be,' said Hermione, as she took her own drink. 'I thought you'd like it.'

Ron took the sugar packet and put some into his coffee. 'Never said I didn't.'

They subsided into a comfortable silence for a few moments while they both drank.

'I didn't really plan this out,' Hermione admitted eventually. 'I just wanted to get out for a bit, I suppose.'

'We don't really have to plan anything,' said Ron. 'We could just sit here.'

'I know,' said Hermione, 'but I thought we could have - oh, I don't know. A heart-to-heart, maybe?' She was thinking of the stories she heard where girls went out with their boyfriends to coffee shops and spent hours and hours talking to each other about all sorts of things, only now she realised she didn't actually know what exactly they'd talk about.

'A heart-to-heart?' Ron laughed. 'About what?'

'I don't know,' Hermione said, now half-laughing too. 'I just - oh, forget it.'

'No, let's do it,' said Ron, still smiling, and he set his coffee aside to lean forward. 'Let's have a heart-to-heart. Like why you wanted to go out today. I know it wasn't the weather, the sun's been out for two weeks now.'

'Alright,' Hermione admitted. 'It wasn't the weather. But - oh, it's just so silly.'

'I love silly,' said Ron. 'Silly's my job. You can tell me, I won't laugh.' He made a mock frown that made Hermione smile a little before she subsided.

'Well,' she said, considering her coffee, 'I guess I've been, I don't know... a bit lonely.'

'Lonely?' said Ron. He looked affronted and a little hurt, and Hermione thought about what she said.

'No, not like that,' she said quickly. 'Not with you. I'm not lonely with you. I like this, I mean. It's nice. You look nice,' she added, because she realised that she had been so nervous about herself that she forgot to say it earlier.

'But,' she continued, 'it's - well, at work,' she said awkwardly, 'you know, there's always people coming in and out, and they're always talking, and you know me, I've never been very good at making friends-'

'But you're-'

'Oh, don't say that, you've known me since I was eleven,' Hermione said impatiently. 'But I always hear everyone talk about their weekends and what they've been doing, going out on dates and nights with their husbands and their friends. And they have fun. But when they come to me,' she sighed, 'and they ask me what I've been doing - I mean, what am I supposed to tell them, the time we had to eat mushrooms for dinner in a tent? I don't do this. Dates, I mean, or going out. And nobody wants to hear about how I filed papers over the weekend, I'd just sound like I work too much. So I don't have anything to say,' she said lamely. 'And, well, I'm not saying it really bothers me, you know I'm not really bothered by any of this, but... you know.'

Ron did not say anything for a long moment, but just when Hermione was starting to get nervous, he said, very slowly, 'well... you do work too much.'

'Ron,' she said, with exasperation.

'What?' he said. 'You said it first.' He was already half-smiling. 'So that's it, then? Blimey, you had me worried for a bit.'

'Ron,' she said again, this time with more amusement than exasperation.

'You know,' Ron grinned, 'if you just want to tell your co-workers how you went on dates with your doting husband, I wouldn't mind.' And he leaned forward to peck her on the cheek.

'Oh, Ron,' Hermione laughed. 'No, it's not that, you know I don't care what anyone thinks of me, but - oh, fine,' she conceded at last, 'maybe I do work too much.'

Ron made a triumphant little fist pump and kissed her again, which set her giggling.

'You blush so much,' said Ron.

'Well, you've just kissed me, haven't you?' laughed Hermione.

'I ought to do it more then,' said Ron, and Hermione gently pushed him away from a third kiss.

'Oh, come on,' she said, composing herself. 'Enough of that. Your coffee's getting cold.'

'So it is,' said Ron, looking down at it in surprise as if he totally forgot about it, which he might have. He made a great show of looking around the shop, then quick as anything he took out his wand and tapped it against his cup until steam rose out of it.

'Ron!' Hermione whisper-screamed, not sure if she should laugh or be angry.

'It's alright,' offered Ron, grinning. 'If anyone sees me they'll just think I'm a barmy idiot who taps his coffee with drumsticks.'

'Ooh, you shouldn't,' said Hermione, who was laughing again. 'You really shouldn't - I'm Head of Department, I can't be doing this!'

'Good thing I did it, then,' said Ron. He leaned forward to kiss her again and when he leaned back Hermione realised her cup was suddenly hot as well.

'Forget about work for now,' said Ron. 'Let‚Äôs have a date. And tomorrow you can go in and tell all your co-workers about how your very lovely husband saved your coffee.'

It begins with a question he asks: ‚ÄúWhy do we practice Nichiren Buddhism?‚Äù Basically, the answer: it‚Äôs to become happy and create value despite all of the challenges of life. Yesterday I followed his thoughts about the first of the Four Sufferings‚Äîall the stuff that just comes from being born and living.

Today I read about Aging (or is it ‚ÄúAgeing‚Äù?), the second Suffering.
>Aging is the second of the four sufferings. Life passes by in a flash. In the blink of an eye, we are old. Our physical strength wanes, and things start to go wrong with our bodies. Our practice of Nichiren Buddhism enables us to make our old age a time of great richness, like a golden autumn harvest, instead of a time of sad and lonely decline. The setting sun bathes the Earth and sky in a magnificent glow. We practice Nichiren Buddhism so we can enjoy just such a vibrant, glowing old age, without regrets.

Isn‚Äôt this beautiful? I think those qualities were so apparent, attractive, and compelling when Guy and I met Bob and True. The same thing with Roz and Andy. If aging is like this, then we wanted some of the good stuff!

But aging is not just for ‚ÄúSGI Olds.‚Äù I am so thrilled watching Laverne & Shirley who took such a big swing into uncharted territory at a mature state of life when they quit their well-paying and safe jobs to open a B&B/restaurant/conference center. Let me age with that spirit of adventurism!

not sure what I'm looking for here and if I actually have enough energy to invest in long conversations now, so if you have something specific in mind or don't like wasting time, be aware. but it's been a long time since I talked to anybody outside my usual social circle, which is pretty narrow. I am stuck in a bubble doing the exact same things every day, which include a bit of working (translation), watching countless films and tv shows(basically my main form of escapism, I recently releasing I barely spend any time all quiet, ""in the present""), and indulging in little hobbies, such as crocheting ( didn't make a single piece I'm proud of yet, currently working on a cozy sweater, if you're interested). 
it's a bit difficult to describe myself and my life, how do you even write these type of introductions? let me just point out some things that might help draw an abstract picture, if to believe my personal observations and tests: I'm an INFJ, omnivert, 50/50 Hufflepuff/Ravenclaw( I feel like this says a lot about a person, not that I'm a HP nerd). some of the recent films I absolutely loved are The Handmaiden (certified PCW girl, okay?), Ritual, Suzhou River, Our Little Sister( this is my Kore-eda summer). I am in a terrible reading slump for months, so unfortunately nothing to share here. I love coffee, long walks, learning new things/researching a random topic and I'm afraid I daydream a bit too much. I don't want to share pictures of myself and I don't want to know what you look like. I'd prefer that kind of connection that exists somewhere between this reality and the one we would build, if there's ever any connection at all. Smalltalk annoys me. What is your favourite blah lah kind of questions exhaust me. I can be both yapping and keeping distance, you never know, I myself never really know what I need.
This is as much as I can say so far and hope that whoever texts me has some similar interests/feelings yet isn't like me, because there's more beauty and joy in getting to know somebody with different experience/thoughts. Also I'd prefer it to be someone close enough to my age, but definitely not younger than me, no offence. ",1,1756206387.0,r4r,1,0.67,False

Maybe it‚Äôs because I still haven‚Äôt heard from some of my closest friends yet today, the 1 year anniversary of the day my beautiful mum died suddenly in the hospital. I honestly had just been distracting myself this week leading up to it and so I thought I was fine, but it definitely felt a million times heavier waking up this morning to that memory of her slipping away from us. 

I feel like this anniversary feels harder than her birthday, which was a month ago, because for that we were celebrating her life, and today? I don‚Äôt know what we‚Äôre supposed to be doing. I hate remembering the few weeks she spent in hospital, especially the last 2 days when she was a shell of herself and couldn‚Äôt see or speak to us before she died. Those are the memories that haunt me, and I hate that today I just keep thinking about where we were this time last year - sleeping on the floor of her hospital room, being told by the consultant her cancer had built up overnight and burst like a dam everywhere in her body including her brain, hearing her moan and try to speak to us but not being able to, being so incredibly furious as to how this happened when she was her bright chatty lively positive self just days before. 

I‚Äôm still so angry and numb and just all kinds of other indescribable feelings to be honest. Looking back at photos of myself with her I feel like I‚Äôm looking at a different girl, and I have no idea who I am anymore without her.

Today I had her favourite pastry and coffee for breakfast, I am doing a sauna, I‚Äôm going to an art gallery as she was a huge art fanatic, and later we‚Äôre having dinner in her favourite restaurant with our family and close friends, and we‚Äôll have music and poems afterwards which she loved so dearly. 

Although I feel like I don‚Äôt know who I am anymore without her, I am trying so hard to try and live my life by her example. I‚Äôm only 26, and she was only 61 when she died, so it feels impossible to try and navigate my life as a young woman without her to guide me. But I‚Äôm trying so hard. I read somewhere recently that ‚Äúgrief is the tax we pay on love‚Äù and it massively resonated me, as I try to constantly remind myself that I feel so hurt and lost because of how much unconditional love she always gave me and my brother. We were so lucky to have Marian as our mum for the time we did, she was a remarkably special person and the world was better off with her in it.

We met on a dating site, we were very much loved up for the first 6 months then he got a kidney infection and has been ill since, tired etc.

He is also going through a messy divorce, gets abusive language from the ex, still trying to sell the family home, is skint

We have had a few bad moments. The affection is up and down , this weekend we went from me walking out in floods of tears to me (finally) asking him I want a long term and serious relationship, do you. He said yes but, he is so overwhelmed with the emotion from the divorce, not being with his kids, lack of money, being ill, he doesnt want to make a promise he cant keep. He is starting to look for new jobs and 'i may have to move away'.  He doesnt want to say he loves me, which hurts me. After this we spent all day together and he was very good to me.

I think this is his way of saying 'Dont depend on me' and 'i'm going sometime'

I finally succumbed to looking through his phone

I found he has been buying 'C' this weekend (and probably other occasions the conversation was archived)

I found he has a subscription to grindr that expired yesterday (¬£26.99 think this is a 3 month unlimited)

I found a message to himself saying 'keep throwaway6666777 on board.'

I feel a little used - we both told each other we've been dating because we get lonely without an SO. I do pay for the majority of things and I Help a lot, mega clean of his apartment, with another one coming up. I feel I have supported him so much emotionally. Sex has been non existent since he got ill.

I feel I am just around to solve the loneliness component and help and support him. he doesnt love me, and we dont have a future ?

He does show many nice gestures, getting me a coffee beer other small things. We do get on and talk and talk when we are together. I love him but I am now evaluating what to do

TL;DR 1 year relationship, he is non committal and found expired grindr subscription on his phone.

***Im sorry for the long text...***

Hi. I'm getting to know a guy. We had exchanged numbers before, but he didn't call the first time. I didn't delete his number. I remember he wanted to kiss me after asking for my number, but I refused.

Months later, we met again at the bus stop. We exchanged numbers, and I remembered him, but he didn't have my number saved. He called me that same day, but I was tired, so we agreed to talk the next day in person. I accepted. The next day was Saturday, and I worked half a day. When I left work, he called and said we would meet at the place where he wants to build his future house. He said he didn't have money for a restaurant or a coffee shop. I got scared and thought the worst, so I said no and that I didn't feel comfortable. He accepted, and we talked for a long time on the phone that afternoon.

We talked about many things. I told him I was single and had never dated, and he didn't believe me, which I expected since I'm almost 30. I told him what I was looking for in a man: no kids and a job. I also told him that I wouldn't have sex until marriage because of my religion. He was very understanding. He said he was religious, too, but had a daughter who didn't live with him. I was okay with that. We agreed to go to church together the next day. It was amazing; he was polite, sweet, kind, handsome, and very stylish. I sometimes wondered if he was really single.

In the following days, we texted a lot, and he complimented me a lot. But I started to notice that he was demanding attention that didn't make sense for the stage we were in. He complained because I didn't reply to his messages quickly, and he complained because I didn't ask how his day was at the end of the day. When I asked, he would say he didn't know and then quickly change the subject. I thought it was nothing serious.

A few days later (still in the week we met at church), he started asking about my life goals, like if I wanted to get married and have children. I said yes, and then he asked me to marry him via text message. I laughed and said no. He got upset and said he was getting old and didn't have time to waste.

I was confused because I thought he was joking, but I was patient and explained that I didn't know his family and that it was too soon since we had only had one meeting. I told him I was interested in him and that I liked him. He changed the subject and said he liked the message where I said I liked him. I was confused by how quickly he changed the subject and felt frustrated, but I let it go.

The next day, he wrote that he missed me. My week was busy, so I told him I wouldn't have time. He said ""ok,"" but minutes later, he said he missed me and that I didn't have time for him. I got upset and complained that he was pressuring me. He changed the subject and complimented me. I became furious and showed him the messages he had sent, telling him he was ignoring me and not listening to what I was saying. He stopped and asked to call me.

I accepted, and he said he needed to see me and that I should stop by his workplace. I was furious and complained about his behavior, saying he was moving too fast. I also complained about the marriage proposal. He said it was a joke and that he would never say anything serious in a text message. But I knew that wasn't true; he got furious when I refused the proposal and even threatened that he might never ask me again.

He said I had misunderstood and that when he asks me for anything, it will be in person, including when he asks me to be his girlfriend. At that moment, I remembered that we weren't even a couple yet. I was so caught up in the closeness that I hadn't even noticed that the attention he was demanding didn't make any sense.

At the end of my workday, I hadn't done anything. My mind was full of confusion, and I felt terrible. I asked some friends if his behavior was normal, and one of them said I was overreacting and that all men are like that at the beginning of a relationship.

I had never dated, but I didn't think that was ""normal"" in healthy relationships. I was anxious all the time and felt terrible for thinking he was hurting me. I was so frustrated that I cried for a few minutes. But in the end, I apologized for overreacting but explained what he was doing: ignoring what I was saying and changing the subject, making me think I was getting upset for nothing. He simply wasn't understanding why I was upset. I asked many times, and I had to point out the problem. He apologized in a way that didn't feel 100% genuine, but I let it go.

A few days later, he became distant, but then he came back, sending me messages like ""hi, love,"" ""hi, baby,"" and ""you are beautiful."" Even though I was distant, he kept giving compliments. I was mentally exhausted and froze the app I used to talk to him, but from time to time, I would check to see if he had sent any messages. When I started a conversation, he would stop talking. I started to think that maybe he was normal and that I had pushed away someone amazing, but yesterday he told me he loved me. I didn't believe it (we haven't been ""together"" for a month), so I asked him what he loved about me. Since I had sent a religious joke before, he replied that he loved how involved I was with religious things. I asked what else, and he replied that he wouldn't say it in messages and would only answer in person. I insisted, but he hasn't answered yet.

I think he is love-bombing me, but I'm not sure about anything because I don't know much about him. Maybe he's a narcissist, or maybe it's all in my head.

I've been using the Tapo P110 sockets for a while now, and they've been great. Both cost-effective (around ¬£30 for a 4 pack) and nicely integrated into HA via the Tapo Controller custom integration in HACS. Based on that reliability, I have built up a collection of 20 of them and have been replacing the Tuya ones I previously used. But for the last couple of weeks, I'm regularly finding them going 'unavailable' in Home Assistant, even though they're online in the Tapo app and voice controllable from Alexa. I've created a group and the markdown card above that shows any with current state 'unavailable.' Here's what it's currently showing: just under half of them offline.

They're fixed IP (DHCP reservation rather than static) with the same IPs as used when they were first added to HA. Power cycling them brings them back online, but I can't trust them to stay online. Also, they can't be rebooted from the app and must be physically power cycled. Due to the location of at least one of them, it's actually easier to turn off the ring main and 'reboot' the entire house.

I'm running the latest version of Tapo Controller (3.2.1) according to HACS. Noted in the docs that TP-Link have changed the protocol, but 3.2.1 claims to be compatible with the new one.

For me I wake up and head straight to the bathroom. Guzzle some Biotine, do a Neilmed sinus rinse , pop my Cevemeline, drop in the Xiidra, and head down for coffee. In about 15-20 mins the level of dryness from the night becomes manageable.

Now, I don‚Äôt mean boxers. I mean *nothing*. Just a T-shirt and confidence.

We made eye contact. And instead of closing the blinds or ducking away, this man casually raised his mug, nodded at me, and went back to scrolling on his phone. Like we were two dudes meeting across a bar‚Ä¶ except he was serving full National Geographic.

The worst part? I panicked and nodded back. Like some unspoken ‚Äúgood morning‚Äù bro-code agreement.

Now every time I see him in the hallway, I can‚Äôt look him in the eye. Because I know. And he knows I know.

Factors that we wanted to take into account included how we and some of our friends and family love spicy food, while others ‚Äì especially older guests ‚Äì might not be able to handle chilli as well. We‚Äôre also refraining from beef and pork items, out of consideration for guests‚Äô religious restrictions.

So far, the Asian-style menu that I‚Äôve come up with entails: fried appetisers, steamed rice, fried noodles, braised vegetables, non-spicy chicken stew, fish curry, and [tong sui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tong_sui) and sweet [rice pastries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_cake) for dessert.

We‚Äôd top up for hot coffee and tea, on top of the iced punch, as many older Asians don‚Äôt drink cold beverages, and we will also order individual lunch plates for vegetarian and gluten-free guests.

(Even now, though, I‚Äôm wondering whether this menu might be riskily messy, given that we will both be wearing cream/white! We had spaghetti after our civil ceremony, and the stains never came out.)

In all, this should come to about US$40-50 per head, according to my current budget estimates ‚Äì inclusive of delivery, set-up/take-down, utensils, and rented equipment like chafing dishes/food warmers.

The event is still months away, so we don‚Äôt have the headcount to lock in the exact menu or make a booking yet, which means I will continue to over-think the possibilities!!

What follows is a full 24-hour chronicle of John Chaos Unpredictable‚Äôs latest intervention at the Global Council summit. Timestamps are approximate; reality may have been slightly altered.


---

00:00 ‚Äì Security logs detect a subtle fluctuation in Flapcoin energy near the council entrance. Analysts ignore it. Rookie mistake.

01:15 ‚Äì John‚Äôs shadow appears in the parking lot. Steve #001 accompanies him, balancing a penguin on his shoulder. All cameras inexplicably malfunction.

03:42 ‚Äì A mysterious fog fills the council hall. Penguins begin organizing chairs into concentric circles. Delegates panic, legal advisors faint.

06:00 ‚Äì John announces breakfast will be served‚Ä¶ via interpretive dance. Eggs levitate. Coffee is optional but replaced by tiny Flapcoin-shaped pastries.

08:07 ‚Äì Official summit begins. Delegates attempt normal procedure. John interrupts:

> ‚ÄúNormal is boring. Let‚Äôs add a penguin debate. And kazoo music. Mandatory.‚Äù



09:15 ‚Äì Minor diplomatic crisis resolved when John convinces delegations to compete in a synchronized penguin parade. Winner receives honorary Flapcoins and a miniature crown.

11:03 ‚Äì All electronic devices begin auto-playing the national anthem of Penguinopolis. Analysts report increased heart rates and inexplicable joy.

12:30 ‚Äì Lunch: chaotic sushi, prepared by Steves in top hats. Delegates forced to eat with penguin-shaped chopsticks. Some report existential enlightenment.

14:12 ‚Äì John declares the council cafeteria shall permanently relocate to Penguinopolis. Architects begin drafting blueprints under duress.

16:45 ‚Äì A minor earthquake (or a penguin drumline, unclear) interrupts proceedings. Delegates improvise jazz interpretations. John applauds.

18:00 ‚Äì John stages a ‚Äúmandatory nap‚Äù for all attendees. Sleep is enforced by strategically placed Flapcoin pillows.

20:30 ‚Äì Evening debrief: all reports transformed into haikus. Analysts attempt to decipher meaning. Outcome: inconclusive, but inspiring.

22:50 ‚Äì John introduces ‚ÄúNighttime Flapcoin Ceremony.‚Äù Penguins, Steves, and delegates engage in ritualistic Flapcoin juggling. Chaos at peak intensity.

23:59 ‚Äì John departs, leaving behind a single note on the podium:

> ‚ÄúChaos is the heartbeat of the world. Flapcoins are the pulse. Sleep, dream, and remember me fondly.‚Äù

Consequences:

Coffee shortages persist.

International relations improved in ways nobody can fully explain.

Steves gain honorary diplomatic immunity.

All delegates report mild obsession with penguins.

Is it a ridiculously bad idea to be drinking one Red Bull every day in order to just be a functioning adult? Background: 33F privately diagnosed a few years ago but unmedicated because the clinic literally GHOSTED ME.

I know energy drinks are full of additives and the general consensus is ""they're bad for you"" but honestly Red Bull is like a turbo boost button that allows me to start and efficiently complete tasks in a way that coffee (and I drink a LOT of coffee) just cannot replicate. I wondered if it was one of the other ingredients that had this magical effect on me (started taurine supplements for example) because I drink the same mg of caffeine in coffee form but it doesn't work the same.

If I were medicated I'd be taking stimulants daily - is there any difference?",0,1756204396.0,adhdwomen,8,0.25,False

Bangalore, India‚Äôs Silicon Valley, has always been the hub of innovation, startups, and multinational enterprises. From tech giants in Whitefield to creative startups in Koramangala, the city thrives on business energy. But with this growth comes a major challenge: finding the right workspace.

If you‚Äôre searching for a [500 sqft office space for rent in Bangalore](https://www.workafella.com/office-space/coworking-space-in-bangalore/), you‚Äôre likely weighing options between traditional leasing, coworking models, or managed office solutions. The truth is, in today‚Äôs fast-changing business world, flexibility, scalability, and convenience matter more than just square footage. That‚Äôs why **managed office space in Bangalore** has become the preferred choice for businesses of all sizes.

And among the leaders in this space, **Workafella** stands out ‚Äî offering premium, people-focused workspaces tailored to modern business needs.

# Understanding the Need for 500 Sqft Office Space in Bangalore

Not every business needs a massive office with hundreds of desks. For many startups, boutique firms, or branch offices, **500 sqft office space for rent in Bangalore** is ideal. It‚Äôs compact, cost-effective, and provides room for a small team to collaborate and grow.

But here‚Äôs the challenge: in traditional leasing, a 500 sqft office might come with hidden costs ‚Äî furniture, utilities, maintenance, and long-term lock-ins. This is where **managed office space in Bangalore** comes into the picture. Instead of worrying about fit-outs, infrastructure, and day-to-day operations, businesses can walk into a fully managed, ready-to-use office.

# Why Managed Office Space in Bangalore is the Future

# 1. Plug-and-Play Convenience

Imagine moving into a **500 sqft office space for rent in Bangalore** that‚Äôs already equipped with high-speed internet, ergonomic chairs, meeting rooms, and a reception area. That‚Äôs exactly what **managed office space in Bangalore** offers. Workafella, for instance, ensures that businesses don‚Äôt waste time setting up‚Äîthey can start working from day one.

# 2. Flexibility to Scale

A startup may begin with five employees today but grow to twenty within a year. A traditional lease creates rigidity. In contrast, managed spaces like Workafella allow you to scale up or down effortlessly. If 500 sqft isn‚Äôt enough tomorrow, you can seamlessly expand within the same facility.

# 3. Prime Locations

Bangalore is notorious for its traffic. Choosing a **500 sqft office space for rent in Bangalore** that‚Äôs strategically located can save hours of commute time. Workafella offers [managed office spaces](https://www.workafella.com/) in prime areas like Whitefield, MG Road, and Koramangala, ensuring accessibility for both clients and employees.

# 4. Cost Efficiency

With **managed office space in Bangalore**, you don‚Äôt pay separately for utilities, housekeeping, or furniture. Everything is bundled into one transparent cost. For a **500 sqft office space for rent in Bangalore**, this means predictable budgeting and no hidden surprises.

# The Human Side of Office Space

Numbers and square footage matter, but offices are about people. A well-designed **500 sqft office space for rent in Bangalore** can foster creativity, collaboration, and wellbeing.

Workafella designs its managed offices with this human touch. Natural lighting, ergonomic setups, community lounges, and breakout areas create a balance of productivity and relaxation. Employees don‚Äôt just work ‚Äî they thrive.

# Amenities That Elevate Workafella‚Äôs Managed Office Spaces

What sets **Workafella‚Äôs managed office space in Bangalore** apart is its world-class amenities:

* **High-Speed Internet & IT Support** ‚Äì Stay connected without downtime.
* **Fully Furnished Workstations** ‚Äì Ergonomic chairs, spacious desks, and modern design.
* **24/7 Access** ‚Äì Because work doesn‚Äôt always stop at 6 PM.
* **Housekeeping & Maintenance** ‚Äì A spotless office, without effort.
* **Cafeteria & Pantry Services** ‚Äì Fuel up with coffee or meals onsite.
* **Meeting & Conference Rooms** ‚Äì Impress clients with professional facilities.
* **Wellness Rooms & Breakout Zones** ‚Äì Balance productivity with relaxation.
* **Security & Access Control** ‚Äì Safe, secure, and monitored workspaces.
* **Parking & Accessibility** ‚Äì Convenience for both employees and visitors.
* **Networking Events** ‚Äì Be part of a thriving coworking community.

These amenities ensure that when you choose a **500 sqft office space for rent in Bangalore** with Workafella, you‚Äôre not just renting space‚Äîyou‚Äôre accessing a holistic work ecosystem.

# Real Stories from Bangalore Businesses

* **The Tech Startup:** A five-member app development firm moved into Workafella‚Äôs **500 sqft office space in Bangalore**. Within a year, their team grew to 15. Instead of moving locations, they simply upgraded to a larger managed office within the same facility.
* **The Consulting Agency:** For a boutique HR consultancy, Workafella‚Äôs **managed office space in Bangalore** offered not just a workspace but also access to a network of clients. They secured two major contracts through connections made in the coworking community.
* **The Global MNC:** A multinational set up its Bangalore satellite office with Workafella. The **500 sqft office space for rent in Bangalore** served as a cost-effective base to test the market before scaling operations.

# Why Workafella Stands Out

When it comes to **managed office space in Bangalore**, several providers exist. But Workafella‚Äôs approach is unique:

* **People-Centric Design** ‚Äì Spaces built to inspire productivity and wellbeing.
* **Scalability** ‚Äì Start with a **500 sqft office space for rent in Bangalore**, and scale seamlessly as you grow.
* **Vibrant Community** ‚Äì Entrepreneurs, freelancers, and enterprises under one roof.
* **24/7 Support** ‚Äì From IT troubleshooting to concierge services.
* **Sustainability Focus** ‚Äì Eco-friendly operations with energy-efficient infrastructure.

This makes Workafella more than a workspace provider‚Äîit‚Äôs a partner in business growth.

# The Business Case: Why 500 Sqft Office Space Works

For many businesses, **500 sqft office space for rent in Bangalore** is the sweet spot. It‚Äôs large enough to house a small to mid-sized team, yet compact enough to remain cost-effective. Combine that with the managed services model, and it becomes a powerhouse of efficiency.

With Workafella, you get:

* A central address in Bangalore.
* Professional image without huge capital investment.
* Freedom from operational headaches.
* Flexibility to evolve your workspace with your business.

# Looking Ahead: The Future of Managed Workspaces in Bangalore

The demand for **managed office space in Bangalore** is only set to rise. As more companies adopt hybrid work and remote teams, the need for flexible, professionally managed, and cost-efficient offices will grow.

For businesses seeking a **500 sqft office space for rent in Bangalore**, Workafella offers the perfect bridge: the intimacy of a small office with the infrastructure of a large enterprise.

# Conclusion: Where Space Meets Growth

Choosing office space isn‚Äôt just about square feet‚Äîit‚Äôs about possibilities. A **500 sqft office space for rent in Bangalore** may look like a number on paper, but with Workafella‚Äôs **managed office space in Bangalore**, it becomes much more: a hub of creativity, productivity, and growth.

Workafella provides the agility, amenities, and community that businesses need to thrive in India‚Äôs most dynamic city. Whether you‚Äôre a startup, consultant, or multinational, the future of work in Bangalore isn‚Äôt in traditional leases‚Äîit‚Äôs in flexible, managed, and human-centered spaces.

This is deep lore, i got 9 pages of just worldbuilding if you are interested. Passion project to mix Lovecraftian style with Detective novel which focuses on the psychological breakdown of characters. 

Here is the Prologue:



Silence. Absence. Void. What do they have in common? Nothing. And nothing, is the better companion oh dear.

Powder oozes from it's thin, brittle outer coating. The smell of gunpowder and sickly-sweet smell holds Em's throat shut. Her eyes squirm with irreversible agony. She walks closer to the¬† carcass of a young woman. She was pretty, missing report since Tuesday called in by a barely coherent mother.¬†

Em drops to a squat. Tears force their way from her eyes and nose. Her whimper breaks free, raw and shaking. She knew what her fate would be once they picked up the Occultist trail. Em really prayed to have a chance at remembering the girl just like how she saw her when they were separating from a coffee hang out on Tuesday noon. She was going to see that horror movie. Em said no, like always. But her god does not care how hard she prayed. Prayed for her sister to be found. Alive. Prayed for every second that didn't come.¬†

Em felt a gentle touch on her shoulder and back, it was Harry. Her dear old friend since the academy was right beside her grieving with her. As Em stands up she cannot bare another look and slowly walks towards the masked man who squeals from his wounds. She squats down to his eye level, almost like she sees him as equal, and clears her throat. ""Where is the rest of you?"" She trembles out a deep message to the masked man. ""Doesn't matter, this is only the beginning and it cannot be stopped. Your girlfriend over there had it easy, you won't be so lucky.""

The man sights in pain as he looks directly at Em. Hollowed out eyes of a white mask de-voided of any features except a single triangular sigil on it's forehead.¬†

""You won't. Make it, unless you repent and join u-""¬†

The man has succumbed to his deep wounds.¬†

""Sh-shit"" Em mutters quietly as her head drops.¬†

""We need to call this in Em, Mike-1 to dispatch we need an ambulance and forensics to 36 Charlie Drive. We found Sabrina Williams' body.""¬†

‚óèBoth of them leads a team of highly skilled fighters which they show both love and frustration multiple times (Tanya leads the Imperial 203rd Aerial Mage Battalion and while the Umbrella Academy doesnt have a leader,Five is the one who is calling the shots most of the time)

‚óèBoth of them either disrespected and disobeyed an order of someone superior and crueler than them which screwed them over greatly (Tanya disrespected Being X and refused to call him god which got her reincarnated in war world in the body of a little girl,while Five disrespected his father and his advices and disobeyed his order to stay home which got him stuck inside the apocalypse for years)

Let's talk about something that's firing up the collective imagination‚ÄîAI automation! Can we take a moment to appreciate how mind-blowing it is to see tedious tasks fly out the window, replaced by algorithms and smart workflows? The wave is cresting and we‚Äôre on our surfboards! üåä

There‚Äôs this tingly mix of excitement and awe when you witness:

- Customer service going 24/7 with helpful, lightning-fast chatbots.  
- Spreadsheets updating themselves while you sip coffee.  
- Creative tools assisting writers, artists, musicians‚Äîbasically helping anyone with an idea unleash something awesome faster than ever before!

What gets me absolutely jazzed is seeing these things no longer living just in sci-fi movies. We‚Äôre coding the future right now, and EVERYONE gets to participate. You don‚Äôt need to be a data scientist to tap into this revolution‚Äîlow-code and no-code tools are putting AI in our hands.

Consider this:

- You want a personal digital assistant tailored to your quirks? It‚Äôs only a prompt away.
- Automating invoice management at your micro-business? Poof! Let the bots handle it.  
- Making your home smarter so the lights dim automatically when you start your Netflix binge? Yup, AI‚Äôs got that too!

Sure, there are BIG conversations around jobs and what the workplace will look like. But isn‚Äôt there something deeply optimistic here, too? Imagine how much more joyful work could be if we free up hours to dream, explore, and focus on what actually inspires us.

And let‚Äôs not forget‚Äîincreased efficiency means more time for life: Friends. Family. New hobbies. That side project you keep putting off. Suddenly, the limits are dropping away.

What AI automation brings is a genuine boost to creativity, productivity, and everyday happiness. It‚Äôs about removing the friction so we can focus on higher, happier pursuits.

My question to this community is: what‚Äôs the coolest or most unexpected way AI automation has changed your life? Or, what would you LOVE to automate if you had no limits?

it has been seven months and i thought it would get easier and i don't think it ever will. i say goodbye to you everywhere i go. i am saying goodbye when i hear a song you might goofily sing and dance to. i say goodbye when i make my morning coffee and have my first sip without you. i am constantly saying goodbye and each goodbye is harder than the last.

it has been seven months and i still can't see my life without you. i still see us walking down the isle, i still see us adopting a dog, and i still see us in rocking chairs. your love gave me so much life, comfort, and safety. i am grieving someone who is still alive and that i live with. i always feel it in my soul we will find our way back to each other, but i think i only say that to ease my own pain.

it has been seven months and it wasn't suppose to end like this, i wish we made better choices. i wish i was stronger, i wish i healed myself before hurting you. i wish i knew our last moments were going to be our last. i wish i couldve cuddled you more and lazily been in bed with you while the world passed us by.

it has been seven months and i dont think another love like ours will come my way. in seven more months we might be strangers. i remember our first date and didn't think such a moment would be so pivotal in my life, but then again the biggest moments never announce themselves.

I'm in the kitchen, waiting for the kettle to boil, tpaping my foot impatiently like I do every single morning. ü§î And out of nowhere, I suddenly realized how often I rush throough tihngs without even noticing I'm doing it.

I mean, it's my little daily ritual, but I'm always in such a hurry to get to the next step. It's not just coffee, though. I think this impatience kinda seeps into other afeas too. Like, when was the last time I just sat with a book and trluy enjoyed it without peeking at my phone every few minues?

This morning made me thnik about slowing down and being more present. Maybe it's time to savor each sip a bit more... and maybe actually get through that book I've been ""reading"" for months. üòä",11,1756204060.0,snapinsight,0,1.0,False

Now, she's back with a vengeance. Follow her journey of revenge, love, and self - discovery in this thrilling novel.Aug 26 2025

Chapter 1.

""Ma'am, seen the whole collection now? Nothing catches your eye?""

""Ma'am?""

Rosalind Johansen blinked, pulled from her thoughts.

Her finger landed at random on a diamond necklace.""This one. Wrap it up.""

Relief washed over the clerk's face.""Right away.""

A wave of satisfaction rippled through the boutique staff.

Rosalind's daily visits for three months were legendary.

""Ms. Johansen,"" one associate ventured, envy clear in her voice,""your husband must cherish you! Treating jewels like everyday trinkets... Incredible.""

""They're right,"" another added.""Follow the money, find the love. A man spending like that? He's utterly devoted.""

""Rich and a hopeless romantic. Life truly favors you, Ms. Johansen...""

Rosalind offered a thin, distant smile at the flattery.

Her attention stayed fixed on the associate across the room, the one quietly packaging her purchase, not jostling for favor.

Her hands were particularly striking, delicate, pale, and graceful.

Rosalind felt a flicker of self‚Äîdisgust, like some kind of stalker.

She needed to see up close the woman who'd shattered her husband's famed self‚Äîcontrol.

What magic did this ordinary shop girl possess to make her husband discard their fifteen years together, trample every sacred vow, and choose her?

The associate's name was Latoya Middleton. Her face wasn't classically beautiful, just pleasant.

But those hands were exquisite, delicate, and perfectly formed. Even a woman could appreciate them. It was no wonder a man would be captivated.

As Rosalind was leaving, she asked,""Could you do me a favor?""

As a top‚Äîtier VIP client, the answer was always yes.

She slid the ring off her ring finger and handed it to the associate.""Melt this down for me, please.""

The associate looked shocked.""But ... this is your wedding ring? And ... it looks like there's an inscription?""

There was indeed an inscription: CF and RJ, the initials of Christopher Foret and Rosalind Johansen.

Christopher had engraved it himself.

The associate double‚Äîchecked,""Ms. Johansen, this ring must hold such significance. Are you sure you want it melted?""

""Yes,"" Rosalind stated firmly.""Please do it as soon as possible.""

...

Rosalind arrived home as evening fell.

She had barely stepped through the front door when Christopher barreled out, nearly knocking her over.

She stumbled back several steps, almost losing her balance.

Luckily, a strong hand shot out and caught her around the waist, preventing the fall.

Christopher frowned, a light sheen of sweat on his brow.""Where were you? Why are you only getting home now?""

""Yes, Mrs. Foret,"" chimed in Liza Lester, their housekeeper.""It's past seven. You should let Mr. Foret know if you'll be out late. He was ready to call the police...""

Standing slightly behind Christopher was his assistant, Joshua Pruitt.

Seeing her, Joshua visibly relaxed and spoke into his phone.""Sir, my apologies. Mrs. Foret is home now. Thank you for your time.""

Christopher leaned down slightly, quickly scanning her for any sign of harm.

Seeing she was unhurt, the tension in his face eased a fraction.""Your phone was off. I thought something had happened to you.""

He instinctively reached out to touch her cheek, then frowned again.""You're freezing.""

Rosalind pushed his hand away and moved past him into the house.""Just needed some air. Felt stifled in here. My phone died.""

Christopher caught up in two strides, shrugging off his suit jacket and draping it around her shoulders as he guided her inside.""The wind picks up at night. Don't catch a chill.""

Rosalind tried to pull away, but his arm held firm. She stopped resisting.

Once inside, Christopher started issuing orders.""Liza, make Rosa hot coffee to warm her up.""

Then he turned to Joshua.""Go to Blossom Eatery. Get her usual favorites. Tell them easy on the salt and sugar.""

""Right away, Mr. Foret.""

Soon, they were alone in the living room.

Christopher kept his arm firmly around her shoulders, a gesture both possessive and protective. His voice, however, was gentle.""I was a bit frantic earlier. I'm sorry if I sounded harsh, Rosa. Please don't be angry.""

He also despised black coffee due to the harsh nature of it in most places. 

Wanted a less bitter cup so went with MS estate pourover. I don't have my own v60, I have an espresso machine and a fp so haven't made a purover myself ever altho have tasted a few.

As I was just showing my father their espresso machine and grinders(not sure how much of it he appreciated it as much as meüòÖ) they asked me if I would like to do the pourover myself. I was absolutely thrilled at this point. Ig there weren't many ppl in the cafe also at that time so it worked out perfectly.

1st pour was done by the barista, the 2nd and 3rd by me. Got the 2nd pour a little uneven altho my 3rd pour was pretty good for a beginner . And the coffee tasted just amazing. My father, who despised black coffee also appreciated it this time, even sensed the different flavour notes in it apart from just coffee. 

Overall, almost everytime I visit BT cafes the baristas always give off good vibes and their attitude is also very welcoming, and that's just great.
