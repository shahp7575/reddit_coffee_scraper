For months, *months*, I was a creature of habit. Every single weekday, 7:30 AM sharp, I'd hit up 'The Daily Grind' for my extra-large black coffee. And every single weekday, there she was, a few spots ahead of me in line, usually buried in a book, her dark curls catching the morning light. We never spoke, just exchanged those fleeting, polite glances – the 'I see you exist in my morning routine' kind.

It became this weird, unspoken rhythm. Her scent – something subtle, like vanilla and old books – would waft over sometimes, and I'd catch myself wondering about her. Was she a writer? A student? Did she also secretly judge people who ordered complicated frappuccinos before 8 AM? The mystery just added to the whole coffee shop vibe. I even started timing my arrival to subtly coincide with hers, which, looking back, is peak 'main character energy' but also kinda sweet, right?

Then, disaster struck. Or, rather, destiny. One Tuesday morning, I showed up, ready for my usual caffeine fix, and there was a giant 'OUT OF ORDER' sign taped to the espresso machine. Panic. She was there too, looking equally bereft. We both ended up migrating to the smaller, slightly less cool coffee shop a block over. As we waited in *that* line, she actually looked up from her book, met my eyes, and laughed. ""Guess we're all migrating today, huh?"" 

That simple sentence. It was like a dam broke. We talked. For an hour. We realized we lived in the same apartment building – different floors, but still! And the absolute kicker? We both collected vintage sci-fi comics. Seriously, what are the odds? From silent coffee strangers to swapping comic recommendations over mediocre lattes in less than an hour.

Fast forward three years, and we're married. My morning coffee ritual went from a mundane necessity to the literal starting point of my entire future. Sometimes, the universe just knows what it's doing, even when you're just trying to get your caffeine fix.

Day 2: Kochi → Thekkady

Day 3: Thekkady

Day 4: Thekkady → Varkala

Day 6: Varkala

Day 7: Return to Delhi

Questions

	1.	Is this itinerary too hectic with a 5-year-old?

	•	Especially Thekkady → Varkala travel day

Obviously, I’m biased. I think these folks I work with are some of the best in the world. I feel really fortunate."" + More reactions from Teyana Taylor, Ethan Hawke...","**“Sinners” is the the most nominated film in Oscars history. How are you processing that record?**

**Zinzi Coogler:** I don’t know that it’s truly settled in yet. We’re still trying to catch our bearings. Like. literally for any morning, it’s so early. But what an insane honor.

**Ryan Coogler:** I was very impressed by everything that my collaborators were doing every day, so I’m so happy that everybody got recognized by their peers. Obviously, I’m biased. I think these folks I work with are some of the best in the world. I feel really fortunate. Because it doesn’t always go that way.

**Did you wake up early to hear the nominations?**

**Ryan Coogler:** I turned on YouTube when I woke up. Me and Zinzi sleep in the same room \[laughs\], so it was like “Hey, get up.” Very similar to how it’s been for 20-something years. It was no different from when we were in New Oreleans or on other movies. It was nice to roll over and turn on YouTube. We were up late last night working, so we’re still waking up. We’re all in California, and we’ve gotta *\[laughter\]* take the kids to school. But Sev, you say what happened with you, bro.

**Sev Ohanian:** At 5:15 a.m., my doorbell rang. *“Ding Dong.”* My parents and my sister were like, “Hey, we brought food.” So I got a chance to watch it with the family. It was awesome.

*Amy Madigan was nominated for best supporting actress for “Weapons.”*

**Congratulations on your nomination. How are you feeling?**

I feel really happy. I’ve had a long career, and it’s really nice that people are responding so well to “Weapons.” I love Aunt Gladys. She is a really cool character who has turned into an iconic. So hats off to Aunt Gladys! She is a diva — non-derogatory — with her makeup, jewelry and costumes.

**It’s been 40 years since your last Oscar nomination for “Twice in a Lifetime.” Does the excitement ever wear off?**

It feels completely different because of social media, which did not exist when I did “Twice in a Lifetime.” Gladys has captured people’s hearts, and \[shows that\] horror doesn’t have to be pushed to the side.

**Did you wake up early to watch the nominations?**

It’s very early. I’m not a morning person. I’m here with my dog, Woody, and he’s wondering why we’re up drinking coffee this early. The people that I work with told me last evening, “Make sure your phone is on.” And I said, “OK, I will.” So in the back of my brain, I was somewhat expecting it. But it’s a nice way to wake up.  


\----  


**Academy Award nominee Teyana Taylor. How does it feel to hear that?**

It feels crazy in the best way. I’m so speechless; my voice is halfway gone. Me and my family were literally screaming at the top of our lungs. I had been tossing and turning all night. I knew that nominations were at 8:30 a.m. and my body was like, “Girl, get up. You can’t out sleep this one.” So, I was bright eyed and bushy tailed. I don’t take any of this for granted. I’m emotional in ways that I don’t even have enough words to express.

**You said you fell asleep last night watching “Pretty Woman.” Is Julia Roberts a good luck charm?**

She’s a good luck charm. “Pretty Woman” being one of my favorite movies, especially at such a young age,  it hit different. My favorite line is “I want the fairy tale,” and that’s what this feels like. It feels really good being here — from retiring in 2020 from music and feeling trapped in a box and wanting to spread my wings, I know I can water my whole garden, opposed to just watering one plant or one flower.

*Kate Hudson was nominated for lead actress for “Song Sung Blue”*

**How does it feel to get your second Oscar nomination?**

It feels wonderful. This whole process has been thrilling. It’s allowed some time to reflect on my career, on how much the industry has changed, and how different the whole process is when you’re in one of those movies that people get behind. I feel so lucky to be able to do this for so long, and to have had the career that I’ve had. This is a weird business. As an actor, you’re a hired gun and sometimes you get the role and sometimes you don’t. It just takes one to shift the tide.

**Who was the most unexpected person you heard from on nominations morning?** 

The one I cared most about was Hugh Jackman. He’s my partner. He’s just so happy. We all are. 

*Ethan Hawke was nominated for best lead actor for “Blue Moon”*

**This is your fifth Oscar nomination. Does it feel different to get nominated for a lead performance?**

It does. When you dedicate your life to acting, getting a lead performance nomination means a lot.

**Who is the most unexpected person you’ve heard from?**

The parents of the other kids in my kids’ class. It’s actually kind of funny, when I took Maya, my oldest, to nursery school, I found out that I was nominated for “Training Days” through her preschool teacher. She emailed me this morning, and that felt great.

**This is your fourth nomination for a Linklater film. What works about your collaboration?**

It’s kind of like asking somebody, “How do you ride a bike?” If you think too much, you fall off. It’s just been easy and rewarding for the two of us. We started talking 30 years ago, and we’re still talking to each other, and every now and then, a movie flies out of those conversations.",4,1769105635.0,oscarrace,0,0.75,False

## **The goal:**

This time I've chosen a **northern, cold but bustling street** as the setting, with two policemen in the foreground as something the AI can focus on and warm lighting from a sunset, contrasting the cold snowy street.

I'm gonna present all pictures here, judge for yourself what style you like the best and share it in the comments, so that we can discuss a bit! 😄

**Remember:** All Pay-per-Use models are not considered ""private"", as they are proprietary and offered by third-parties. On the other hand this most often results in higher quality... but most likely doesn't respect your data, in contrast to VeniceAI, so keep that in mind.

## **The rules:**
- Same prompt for every generation
- No regeneration; The first attempt for every model is final, no matter how bad it looks
- Standard settings for each generation, no set seed
- No postprocessing; Images are compared as-is, without any upscaling / enhancing

## **The prompt**:

```txt
An artistic wide shot of a bustling, north european street with pedestrians going about their day, talking to each other and shopping in the shops on the right of the image. The weather is good, slightly cloudy, and the scene has a warm orange tint from the setting sun, contrasting the colder light blue accents of the slightly snowy street. Two policemen are standing relaxed on the left side, chatting and laughing to each other, while holding a paper cup of hot coffee.

What do ya'll think? 😃

My personal favourite is the last image by Seedream, it's the most artistic imo and nails the ""orange-blue contrast"" the best, while remaining true to the rest of the prompt.

I am going to use this space to make journal entries to share with those having similar experiences.  The first word is the title of the entry.  The words following explain breakup number, followed by entry number.  

My ex (19F) and I (21M) have been officially broken up for 6 days.  We broke up on Friday, and then spent the next 2 days together as a “last” sleepover.  Originally we were going to wait to decide the fate of our relationship until the end of that weekend, and to be honest I still wish we had.  I never thought bringing her flowers and Malibu that night would turn into us breaking up.  The weekend that we spent together was so nice, we snuggled the whole time and watched shows and movies, got food and coffee together, smoked together.  It gave me hope that maybe we weren’t done.  It is now Thursday and the past few days have been okay, I’ve been doing alright using my breathing exercises and practicing my manifestation and law of attraction (doesn’t matter if you believe it or not, it relieves anxiety by placing control into the hands of life/ God/ the Universe).  A couple nights it seemed like we were flirting as we used to, but then last night we called for the first time since we saw each other.  She made a couple jokes about us being broken up that really hurt.  I made a few back but only because I was feeling hurt.  This morning we talked about it and she apologized but I still feel like this is a setback for me and my healing.  I feel hurt more today.  I feel sad more today.  It’s 1pm and I haven’t gotten out of bed, which isn’t unusual for me.  I think I will spend most of today working on my project car.  I am supposed to go to a party at my friends apartment on our college campus tonight, and I think that will be really fun.  

My first breakup was last year in April, it destroyed me for the first couple days and I was in a crisis I cried constantly.  It took me 4 days of crisis before I decided I didn’t have to feel this way and I wanted to figure out how to get out of it.  I did research into healing, and research into my severe ADHD to help understand myself a bit better.  I learned meditation, breathing exercises, positive affirmations, law of attraction, etc.  Those mechanisms helped me heal from a 3 year relationship in about a month.  It is amazing how quickly you can heal if your head is in the right place and you do the work to get there.  Fast forward to today, and my new ex and I were together for 7 months.  This relationship wasn’t as long, but I still loved her so much. This time I was only in crisis for about a day before we saw each other for the weekend.  I’ve been healing slowly but surely a little more each day this week.  It is different this time because we decided to stay friends rather than cut it off completely like last time.  But I’m trying my hardest to heal and take things as they happen.  It is nice to be able to rely on myself.  I know myself better than anyone ever will and that is okay.  In the past 4 years I have been single for about a month, and now I get to be single again.  That doesn’t mean I want to look for new relationships yet, it means I get the opportunity to experience life without the commitments of a relationship for a while.  This time I’d like to take more time by myself and learn to love myself before I get into anything serious again.  ",1,1769105551.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I am actively sabotaging her diet and weight pretty much every day because I love how good she looks when she’s chunky.

We have been together for 6 years now, and I am the one that cooks when we don’t order fast food. She is awful at cooking and usually too lazy to. We have lived together for 5 years out of the 6 and I can say her gaining definitely increased once I moved in and started cooking for her daily, obviously. She was already putting on relationship weight before then but this just quickened the process. Now she is what I can only visually guess is around 345lbs (give or take). She used to be petite (140lbs) when we met.

I come home from work a few hours before she does so she has no clue I tamper with her food. I usually sneak extra butter into her portions as this is easy enough to hide. Something like: cook some pasta, separate my portion, then put hers back in the pan with a few spoonfuls of butter. When I make sauces, I add at least half a cup of salt to her portion of it and just mix it out with water so it doesn’t taste obviously salty. 

I do this for pretty much every meal that I can get away with. 

Other things I do is add extra butter and sugar to the desserts I bake her, she loves sweet things so much so she doesn’t mind or mention it if it tastes sugary. I pack her lunches for work, and always give her huge portions of hearty foods that I ensure are as fattening as possible (lasagna, fried chicken and waffles, nachos, are her faves). Whenever I pick up coffees for us, I make sure to ask for a ton more sugar and cream and syrups than she requested (and she already likes those extremely sweet, so she never notices). I make sure to most meats are fried. And when we *do* get fast food, I insist she eats some of my portion because I’m “full” or sometimes I flat-out encourage her to get a double serving or the biggest combo meal on the menu. And if I manage to pick up the fast food myself, I sprinkle extra salty onto the patties and fries. 

I estimate that I can sometimes get her up to 4000 calories a day depending on what she eats and how big her portions are. Maybe close to 5000 if I can really encourage her to binge on more snacks during the night. 

She already had a huge appetite and never liked healthy meals in the first place, she was just able to stave off any major weight gain before my intervention. So it has honestly been easy for me to get away with this. She’ll eat fast food and junk food all day, get midnight snacks, etc. 

She has not suspected anything even remotely and I doubt the thought that it was me adding things to her food would even cross her mind. She has just blamed her own awful eating habits whenever she rips a piece of clothing or can’t get something on. 

Whenever she tries dieting, her calories end up so off because of me adding extras that she never loses a pound. On the days she tries to actually be strict she will think she’s eating 1200 calories a day but with my additions it’s more like 3200 calories. 

But by now she’s gotten so heavy and bloated and lazy that exercise is out of the question. She’ll huff and puff just trying to do squats and her belly will get in the way, so she gives in easily. She hasn’t tried dieting or exercising at all the past six months due to how huge she is.

I just can’t help keeping her so obese. I feel a tad guilty sometimes but she’s so flabby and is such a nice pear shape… she really is just perfect to me. And the sex has only gotten better the bigger she’s gotten. I genuinely would marry her and have her gain to 400 or 500 pounds if she can manage.",0,1769105380.0,confessions,7,0.25,False
1qk1wab,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideHustleGold/comments/1qk1wab/seriously_attapoll_is_my_beer_money_mvp_right_now/,"Seriously, AttaPoll is my beer money MVP right now. Here's my realistic take.","Okay, I was super skeptical about these ""get paid for surveys"" apps. Most are trash with endless disqualifications. But I gave AttaPoll a shot about 3 months ago, and it's honestly the most consistent one I've found.

**The reality:** You won't get rich. Let's get that out of the way. But I'm a student, and it perfectly funds my Spotify and coffee habit each month. I make about **£25-£40 ($30-$50) a month** just doing surveys on the bus, waiting for lectures, or watching TV.

**My ""trick"" is stupid simple:**

1. **Enable notifications.** The good, high-paying surveys go fast. A quick 2-minute survey for £0.50 pops up, you do it immediately, and it's gone in 10 minutes.
2. **Be brutally honest in the profile section.** This sounds counterintuitive, but it helps the app send you surveys you'll *actually* qualify for. Less wasted time.
3. **Check the ""star rating"" before starting.** If a survey has a 3.5+ star rating, it's usually smooth. Avoid the 1-star ones—they're often buggy or disqualify you at the end.
4. **Cash out early.** The minimum is like £3 via PayPal. Don't wait to hit £50. Getting that first payout fast is a huge motivator.

It's not passive, you have to put in the time, but it's the easiest ""task-based"" money I make. If you want to give it a try, you start with a small bonus. Here's my invite link: [**https://attapoll.app/join/vtfql**](https://attapoll.app/join/vtfql)

I haven’t had a monster in a minute, probably over a year. But I’m in Winco yesterday, need a caffeine fix so I grab one of these bad boys. Go about my day, all is well - until this morning. Wake up, have some coffee, and inevitably have to shit. It was a softie, so of course I’ve got to check the butt wipe if it was a never ending wipe or a clean swipe. What a surprise it was when I see green shit on this butt wipe. I’m not kidding, GREEN. Like 🦖<—- the color of this bad boy. For reference, I also ate three pieces of sourdough toast yesterday with jalapeño jelly on it, and apparently that can cause a nice verde poo hue. 

But because I live and breathe by the shared knowledge that is Reddit, I couldn’t think of a better place to post, other than maybe a medical subreddit, but I’d rather not scare the green shit out of myself just yet.

1qk1rv0,https://v.redd.it/8e1okadjxxeg1,Breville Barista Express Not Pressurizing (not grind size issue),"Hey guys so I’ve recently gotten a Barista Express (used which may be what’s affecting this) but it is not getting to the correct pressure level for espresso. The only advice I’ve seen anywhere is adjusting the grind size, but both the inner burr and the outer adjustments are set to the finest setting, 1. In the video, I used one shot just for example and to not waste a ton of coffee, but it’s doing the same thing on two shot as well. I’ve descaled the machine and I’ve backflushed it (which does get up to the correct pressure level). I can’t try the pressurized basket as the machine didn’t come with it (again, I got it used), but since the back flushing gets up to the correct pressure level, I don’t think it’s just the gauge.

Im thinking 100g is the sweet spot, although 50g to 150g (actual batch size) is totally workable. 

I am on a tight budget- Sub $1000 would be good. The less the better. I would consider the Nano-7 ($1300) assuming it was clearly heads and shoulders above the other options.. 

I have also considered: Smola and Freshroast, both <$300, Smola with Probes or Santoker- $500,  and Kaleido M1 Lite -$700, sort of feels like the front runner..

I also own a Kaldi 300g with updated probes and Phidget for Artisan- but with no airflow, i have always felt the results are a bit roasty and char'd.. i would need to spend some $ on it to upgrade a burner with a pressure gauge for repeatable roasts... not sure its worth the money..

Last year my friend “Dan” and I had a dumb fight that lasted like two weeks. The short version: I bailed on helping him with a project last minute (I had a legit family thing pop up), he felt I made him look flaky in front of other people, and we both got snippy. We talked it out over coffee, I apologized for the late notice, he apologized for going nuclear, and we agreed it was done. Since then we’ve hung out normally, no weirdness, no side comments. So when Dan invited me to his birthday, I went, brought a bottle, tried to be chill. About an hour in, one of the guys in the group clinks a glass and does this “speech” about “growth” and “accountability” and how it’s important to clear the air. I’m already getting that stomach-drop feeling. Then he goes, out loud, “And since we’re all family here, maybe (my name) wants to say sorry to Dan properly, like for real this time.” People turned and looked at me, some were smiling like it was a cute bit. Dan didn’t stop it. He just kinda sat there with this half grin and said, “Yeah, man, it’d mean a lot. Just say it.” I said, “We already handled this,” and tried to laugh it off, but then another person goes, “C’mon, don’t be a baby, it’s his birthday.” Someone actually started filming on their phone like it was content. That’s when I realized this wasn’t spontaneous. It felt like I was being set up to perform remorse so everyone could clap and move on.

I got up, said “I’m not doing this,” and walked out. I didn’t yell, I didn’t slam a door, I just left my drink on the counter and left. Ten minutes later my phone starts blowing up. Dan texts “Seriously? You couldn’t just do that one thing for me?” Then a couple people say I made it awkward and “ruined the vibe.” One friend said I’m the jerk because it was “low effort” to just apologize again, and it would’ve cost me nothing. But it did cost something, it cost my dignity? I hate being pressured in front of a crowd, and the filming part made me feel gross. If Dan had pulled me aside and said he was still hurt, I would’ve talked, no problem. But making it a party moment felt petty and kinda humiliating. Now Dan’s acting like I embarrassed him, and I’m sitting here wondering if I overreacted by leaving instead of just swallowing it for 20 seconds.

 TL;DR: Friend and I already resolved an old argument privately, then at his birthday his friends tried to make me apologize publicly (someone even filmed), so I left. AITJ?

When I was preparing to study in the UK, I desperately searched for posts that answered one simple question:

**“How much does a normal week actually cost?”**

Not exaggerated influencer budgets.  
Not extreme penny-pinching.  
Just a realistic, honest breakdown.

So here it is — what I typically spend in a week as an international student in the UK, and what I’ve learned about managing money without constant stress

**Accommodation: The Fixed Cost**

This is the one expense that stays the same every week — and that’s a good thing.

My accommodation cost is **fixed**, which means:

* Rent is predictable
* Utilities are included
* No surprise bills

Choosing student accommodation through **University Living** helped here. Using their **price filters**, I could compare properties within my budget and pick one where utilities were already included. That clarity makes weekly budgeting much easier.

When your biggest expense is sorted, everything else feels manageable.

**Food & Groceries**

This varies week to week, but I keep it consistent by:

* Doing one main grocery shop
* Cooking most meals
* Limiting eating out

Groceries feel expensive at first, but once you learn which stores are affordable, costs stabilise.

Cooking at home is the biggest money-saver.

**Transport**

Because I live close to campus, I walk most days.

This saves:

* Money
* Time
* Energy

Accommodation location plays a huge role here — and being able to filter properties by distance on University Living helped me avoid unnecessary transport costs.

**Small Extras (The Sneaky Spend)**

This includes:

* Coffee with friends
* Snacks
* Occasional eating out
* Random essentials

These small expenses add up quietly — but they’re also part of enjoying student life. I don’t cut them out completely; I just stay mindful.

**A Sample Weekly Breakdown**

Here’s what a **typical week** looks like for me (approximate):

* Accommodation (weekly portion): **Fixed**
* Groceries: Moderate
* Transport: Minimal
* Eating out / coffee: Occasional
* Miscellaneous: Low

The key isn’t perfection — it’s consistency.

**What I’ve Learned About Student Spending**

* Your first few weeks will be more expensive — that’s normal
* Budgeting gets easier with routine
* You don’t need to track every pound
* Fixed costs reduce mental load

Financial discipline doesn’t mean deprivation — it means awareness.

**Conclusion**

Living in the UK as a student doesn’t require extreme budgeting or constant anxiety.

Once your accommodation is sorted and your weekly patterns settle, expenses become predictable — and manageable.

This isn’t about spending less at all costs.  
It’s about spending **intentionally**.

And with the right tools and planning, student life abroad can be financially sustainable *and* enjoyable.",1,1769104534.0,u_Low-Astronaut3147,0,1.0,False
1qk1i4b,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmITheJerk/comments/1qk1i4b/aitj_for_refusing_to_keep_covering_for_a_coworker/,AITJ for refusing to keep covering for a coworker who is always late but very likeable,"I work in a small office team of about 10 people and we rotate opening duties. Nothing crazy just unlocking the door starting coffee and being ready for the first calls. One coworker Jenna is late constantly. Not once in a while but like 10 to 20 minutes several times a week.



At first I didnt mind. She is super friendly always apologetic and has some kind of story every time. Traffic alarm phone update whatever. When she is late I just cover and no one says anything. This has been going on for months and I guess I trained everyone to expect it.



Last week I was running late myself for once and didnt text ahead. Jenna was scheduled to open. I got a call from our manager asking why the office was still locked. I explained I wasnt the opener and mentioned Jenna was scheduled. Turns out she showed up almost 30 minutes late again.



After that my manager pulled me aside and asked why I never mentioned this pattern before. I was honest and said I didnt want to make it a big deal or get anyone in trouble. He said it actually made things worse because now it looked like a one off issue instead of a pattern.



Since then Ive stopped covering. If Jenna is late I just let it be obvious. She noticed immediately and asked me why I stopped helping her out. I said I wasnt comfortable taking responsibility for something thats not mine anymore.



Now a couple coworkers are saying Im being petty and that everyone likes Jenna so I should just chill. I dont hate her at all but Im tired of quietly fixing the same issue over and over. Am I the jerk for finally letting it be seen",7,1769104457.0,AmITheJerk,6,1.0,False

I’m 21 (she's 22 if that even matters) and honestly pretty inexperienced with dating. This is the first time I’ve felt like this about someone at work, so I’m trying to move slowly and be respectful instead of impulsive

A few weeks ago during group work for a presentation at my internship, I ended up spending a lot of time with a female colleague. We worked closely, talked a lot, and the conversations flowed easily. I realized I liked her not just physically but because she’s confident, articulate, and easy to be around. After the project ended, I assumed everything would just go back to normal and that the closeness was probably situational.


 But since then she’s still been warm and normal with me, has initiated conversations a few times, and there hasn’t been any awkward avoidance. Recently she mentioned that the food at her PG is bad and that she sometimes eats breakfast at the office. My PG food is bad too, so later I called her for some work related clarification and mentioned it. 

During that call she said that if I’m having breakfast at the office, we could go together. I agreed, and she replied pretty enthusiastically saying she’ll call me in the morning. This is honestly the first time in my life I’m doing a one on one thing like this with a woman, so I’m nervous but trying to stay grounded. 

What’s confusing me is that I don’t know if she’s single or dating someone. She has male friends at work and spends time with a group, but I genuinely can’t tell what the situation is. 

I don’t want to mistake friendliness for romantic interest, but I also don’t want to be so afraid that I never express interest at all. My intention isn’t to rush or pressure her. I was thinking of asking her out for something simple like coffee at some point, once things feel a bit more stable, and only once, respectfully.

 From a woman’s point of view, does this sound like normal friendliness or like someone who might be open to getting to know me more? Is it okay to ask someone out once in this context even if I don’t know their relationship status? Are there any red flags here that I might be missing? I’m genuinely trying to handle this in a mature way and not overthink myself into paralysis, so I’d really appreciate honest advice.
TL;DR: Got close to a coworker during project work, things still feel warm and normal, she suggested we get breakfast together, I like her but don’t know if she’s single. Is it reasonable to ask her out once or am I overthinking friendliness?",2,1769104278.0,GenZIndia,1,1.0,False

1qk1df0,https://v.redd.it/f69ewgaxuxeg1,Swift Native Module Scroll Issue Help,"Hey everyone, I'm building a component of my app which uses the expo-map package to render a native map. However on AppleMaps.View there is no option to present a marker at a coordinate AND also when clicked, show the detail view of the place (POI) on that marker. It will only work when we don't render a marker, in which case upon tapping the place of interest (coffee shop in the video) we get the detailed POI view. Because of this, I've implemented my on custom swift module that implements

`MKMapItemDetailViewController` to present the POI detail view, in a sheet manually by calling `onMarkerClick` and presenting the custom swift module sheet.

As you can see in the video, there is a conflict in handling scrolling and the expansion / collapse of upon sheet detent change. I thought this was an issue with my custom implementation, but as you can see in the video, when I click on a place that isn't the marker, the native detail view shows up and also has the exact same issue, leading me to the understanding that this is a native issue of `MKMapItemDetailViewController`. The basic issue, which you can see in the video, is that we are only allowed scroll events when we attempt a scroll from an area where there is a view that registers touch events. If I try to scroll from someplace else where there is no touchables, we get the bug where the sheet or native modals begins interpreting the drag as a modal dismissal. Considering this, and my very limited knowledge of Swift, is there anyone that can help me solve this issue, if even possible? It seems to be a native issue of the view controller but perhaps there is a way to address it overriding the gestures and scroll behaviour manually?

              onWillDismiss={() => {
                setMarkerKey((key) => key + 1);
              }}
            >
              <View className=""flex-1"">

I own and operate Luxury V3, a global discovery / intelligence platform focused on emerging and independent luxury brands.

I recently started it because of my public profile working with luxury CEOs from foreign nations who needed strategic partnerships/introductions to the United States.

Because I now market across New York, Paris, and Geneva, I’ve been gaining access to private conversations and deal flow. Much of what I see sits at the intersection of IP, consumer, and manufacturing.

For example, a few years ago in Paris, I built a relationship with a pharmaceutical CEO who just received $80M in non-dilutive French gov funding to revive an existing drug patent. Through a personal introduction from his CFO, he offered me pre-IPO shares in his holding company in exchange for access to one of my billionaire contacts in Washington DC. It didn’t work out at the time, but I literally later watched the valuation 5x and the guy sell to someone else, and personally cashed out $100M for the 1 drug (not holding company that I would have shares in) he created on behalf of France. It was a bit lesson that I had to learn to move fast and stay connected to funders.

I am now intentionally looking to align with the right funder or search team that wants proprietary access to vetted founders and high-end private deals.

I’m not a banker. I’m just a connector and operator who sits close to decision makers. At 30, I’m focused on spending the next decade funding these insanely successful founders and brands with the right capital partners and helping funders access opportunities they would not otherwise see.

If this resonates, I’m open to joining a search or investment team -or- curated deal flow -or- exploring structured partnerships.

Happy to connect here or directly.

1qk1adh,https://v.redd.it/u53bhn0jvweg1,Swift Native Module Scroll Issue Help,"Hey everyone, I'm building a component of my app which uses the expo-map package to render a native map. However on AppleMaps.View there is no option to present a marker at a coordinate AND also when clicked, show the detail view of the place (POI) on that marker. It will only work when we don't render a marker, in which case upon tapping the place of interest (coffee shop in the video) we get the detailed POI view. Because of this, I've implemented my on custom swift module that implements 

`MKMapItemDetailViewController` to present the POI detail view, in a sheet manually by calling `onMarkerClick` and presenting the custom swift module sheet.

As you can see in the video, there is a conflict in handling scrolling and the expansion / collapse of upon sheet detent change. I thought this was an issue with my custom implementation, but as you can see in the video, when I click on a place that isn't the marker, the native detail view shows up and also has the exact same issue, leading me to the understanding that this is a native issue of `MKMapItemDetailViewController`. The basic issue, which you can see in the video, is that we are only allowed scroll events when we attempt a scroll from an area where there is a view that registers touch events. If I try to scroll from someplace else where there is no touchables, we get the bug where the sheet or native modals begins interpreting the drag as a modal dismissal. Considering this, and my very limited knowledge of Swift, is there anyone that can help me solve this issue, if even possible? It seems to be a native issue of the view controller but perhaps there is a way to address it overriding the gestures and scroll behaviour manually?

This is how I'm using my custom module in react-native, but as I said this is a native issue, since even the expo-maps detail modal has the same issue, so I know its not a react-native specific thing:

              onWillDismiss={() => {
                setMarkerKey((key) => key + 1);
              }}

**Wristrax** allows you to download music from your own Plex library to your Apple Watch for offline playback, using your AirPods or other Bluetooth headphones or speakers paired to the Watch.

The iPhone app handles library access and download. Once in your phone, the tracks can be synced with the included Wristrax Watch app.

**Features**:

iOS app:

* Authentication via [Plex.tv](http://Plex.tv), so your details are not stored in the app
* browse artists and their albums & playlists
* Select albums and playlists for download to phone
* Chose quality:
   * compressed at 128, 256 or 320kbps: Everything above will be transcoded before download to safe space
   * Original: download files as is (Watch with AirPods supports CD quality lossless)
* Sync downloaded tracks with Apple Watch (file transfer in the background, not the fastest, but it works. There is no better alternative to this method as the Watch networking capabilities Apple allows are very limited.)
* Supports multiple servers (not at the same time)
* Supports multiple audio libraries on the same server
* Supports multible home users

That being done, I thought I would put together a writeup in case anyone else finds it useful.
 
Some system info first. This is what I'm working with, it *shouldn't* make any difference if you are on a different distro, I only include it for the sake of completeness. I run Arch, with no desktop environment, and i3 as my window manager. It works for me, you do you.

What we're going to setup today is:

[Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/)

[Elite Dangerous](https://www.elitedangerous.com/)

[Minimal Elite Dangerous Launcher](https://github.com/rfvgyhn/min-ed-launcher)

[Elite: Dangerous Market Connector](https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector)

[Elite Dangerous AFK Monitor](https://github.com/PsiPab/ED-AFK-Monitor)

Throughout my guide I am going to talk about my own paths in the filesystem. I am *assuming* that if you're going down this road you know how to update paths for your own preferences accordingly.

First things first, update your packages and install Steam via your distro repo or their download. I won't detail this step. If you're using Linux and playing games then you already know how to do this.

Fire up Steam, install Elite Dangerous, right-click, Properties, and then choose your preferred Compatibility setting for it. I go with Proton Hotfix. Your mileage may vary.

Launch ED, get yourself logged in to your first account, close it down.

Fire up your favorite terminal or file manager.

Navigate to `~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata` and `cp -R 359320 EDP1` then `cp -R 359320 EDP2`

The purpose of this is so that you can run two pilots at the same time with independent Journal directories. I searched high and low and did not find a better solution than this. If you are really crunched for disk space you can symlink *everything* back to `359320` except for the Elite Dangerous directory in Saved Games:


`~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/EDP1/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/Saved Games/Frontier Developments/Elite Dangerous`
`~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/EDP2/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/Saved Games/Frontier Developments/Elite Dangerous`

Those however you *can* symlink elsewhere to make your Journal files easier to locate in the future. I have mine symlinked out to ~/games/ED-Logs/EDP1 and EDP2

`mkdir -p ~/games/ED-Logs/{EDP1,EDP2}`

`ln -s ""$HOME/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/EDP1/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/Saved Games/Frontier Developments/Elite Dangerous"" ""$HOME/games/ED-Logs/EDP1""`
`ln -s ""$HOME/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/EDP2/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/Saved Games/Frontier Developments/Elite Dangerous"" ""$HOME/games/ED-Logs/EDP2""`

Now that we have our separate Journal directories we can freely use supporting applications to receive, record, submit each pilot's data in isolation. Many ED applications do a good job parsing the Journals and figuring out which pilot is doing what, but not all of them. Finding a way to *[keep 'em separated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jOk8dk-qaU)* became an important part of what I was doing.

Next step, [Minimal Elite Dangerous Launcher](https://github.com/rfvgyhn/min-ed-launcher). Rather than provide install instructions for that, I am going to send you to the author for their documentation. Because it's good, and if it ever changes this post will still be as current as their own docs!

For my own setup, I merely downloaded the latest release and uncompressed it into `$HOME/gamed/ed-mods/medl` and was good to go. When you first use the Minimal ED Launcher it will create a [settings file](https://github.com/rfvgyhn/min-ed-launcher?tab=readme-ov-file#settings). Mine is located at `~/.config/min-ed-launcher/settings.json` and the contents are:

    {
        ""apiUri"": ""https://api.zaonce.net"",
        ""watchForCrashes"": false,
        ""language"": null,
        ""autoUpdate"": false,
        ""checkForLauncherUpdates"": true,
        ""maxConcurrentDownloads"": 4,
        ""forceUpdate"": """",
        ""processes"": [],
        ""shutdownProcesses"": [],
        ""filterOverrides"": [
            { ""sku"": ""FORC-FDEV-DO-1000"", ""filter"": ""edo"" },
            { ""sku"": ""FORC-FDEV-DO-38-IN-40"", ""filter"": ""edh4"" }
        ],
        ""additionalProducts"": []
    }

Now before we begin using Minimal ED Launcher, lets confirm that ***both of your ED accounts are linked to Frontier accounts***. Both of my accounts originated through Steam accounts are were linked to Frontier Accounts via their [Login page](https://www.frontierstore.net/customer/account/login/). It doesn't matter if they are both tied to Steam accounts though, we're really only using Steam for the simplicity of installation and Proton. What *does* matter is that your accounts are connected to Frontier. Anyway... assuming that is done it is now time to start building our launch script for each pilot.

Obviously, make sure that where you place your script is in your $PATH variable.

`vim ~/.local/bin/edp1`

    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    
    # Environment variables
    export ED_JOURNAL_DIR=""$HOME/games/ED-Logs/EDP1/""
    export STEAM_COMPAT_DATA_PATH=""$HOME/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/EDP1""
    export STEAM_COMPAT_CLIENT_INSTALL_PATH=""$HOME/.local/share/Steam""
    
    VENV=""$HOME/.venv""
    
    # Run MinEdLauncher with arguments
    ""$HOME/games/ed-mods/medl/MinEdLauncher"" \
      ""$HOME/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Proton Hotfix/proton"" \

      /novr \
      /autorun \
      /autoquit \
      /edo \
      /frontier \
      edp1 &

You can ignore the VENV for now, we'll get to that in due time. Leave the line in the script though.

Make a copy of `edp1` and call it `edp2`, update `edp2` for your second pilot by changing EDP1 to EDP2, and edp1 to edp2.

`chmod +x ~/.local/bin/edp*`

Go ahead and run `edp1` ***from a terminal*** so that you get prompted to login via Frontier and it creates the .cred file that Minimal ED Launcher will use to login. Do the same for `edp2` and your second account at this time.

That should be all you need to use Minimal ED Launcher and two accounts with separate Journal locations! So, one big hurdle complete.

Next we will install EDMC and make sure we can run two independent instances. Time to setup a Python virtual environment. You do have Python right? I hope so. I keep a comprehensive venv in my home directory for general usage.

`python -m venv $HOME/.venv`

Go get the latest EDMC. I cloned the repo into ~/games/ed-mods/edmc

`git clone https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector.git ~/games/ed-mods/edmc`

Now lets make sure we have the requirements to run it.

    source ~/.venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r ~/games/ed-mods/edmc/requirements.txt

Now, lets run EDMC once so that it creates default config files.

`python ~/games/ed-mods/edmc/EDMarketConnector.py`

Go ahead and setup some sane defaults then close EDMC. Don't worry about specifying your log directory or authenticating with Frontier just yet. That will happen when it needs to. The default config file on my system was created at `~/.local/share/EDMarketConnector/config.toml`

Locate your default `config.toml` and make two copies, you guessed it: `edp1.toml` and `edp2.toml`

Open up your new config files with your favorite editor and make sure these entries are empty for now:

    cmdrs = [
        """",
    ]
    edsm_cmdrs = [
        """",
    ]
    edsm_usernames = [
        """",
    ]
    edsm_apikeys = [
        """",
    ]
    fdev_apikeys = [
        """",
    ]
    inara_cmdrs = [
        """",
    ]
    inara_apikeys = [
        """",
    ]
    fcms_cmdrs = [
        """",
    ]

If you want a different set of plugins for each pilot then make sure `plugin_dir` has a different path for each. I run the same plugins for both pilots.

You remember our bash scripts `edp1` and `edp2`? Time to update them.

They should now look like this:

    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    
    # Environment variables
    export ED_JOURNAL_DIR=""$HOME/games/ED-Logs/EDP1/""
    export STEAM_COMPAT_DATA_PATH=""$HOME/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/EDP1""
    export STEAM_COMPAT_CLIENT_INSTALL_PATH=""$HOME/.local/share/Steam""
    
    VENV=""$HOME/.venv""
    
    # Run MinEdLauncher with arguments
    ""$HOME/games/ed-mods/medl/MinEdLauncher"" \
      ""$HOME/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Proton Hotfix/proton"" \
      run \
      ""$HOME/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Elite Dangerous/EDLaunch.exe"" \
      /novr \
      /autorun \
      /autoquit \
      /edo \
      /frontier \
      edp1 &
    
    # Activate the virtual environment for EDMarketConnector
    echo ""Activating virtual environment...""
    source ""$VENV/bin/activate""
    # --force-localserver-for-auth
    sleep 60
    python ""$HOME/games/ed-mods/edmc/EDMarketConnector.py"" ""--config"" ""$HOME/.local/share/EDMarketConnector/edp1.toml"" &

This will launch Elite Dangerous via the minimal launcher, wait a minute, and then launch your EDMC for your pilot. If everything is working fine, go ahead and setup your credentials with EDSM, Inara, Frontier, etc. and then you can close down ED and EDMC for now. Be sure you update `edp2` and repeat the steps for your second pilot.

Alright, moving on to [Elite Dangerous AFK Monitor](https://github.com/PsiPab/ED-AFK-Monitor)! Head over to github and get the [Python version](https://github.com/PsiPab/ED-AFK-Monitor?tab=readme-ov-file#python-version). <= that link goes right to the developer's instructions.

I have mine installed at `$HOME/games/ed-mods/ED-AFK-Monitor/`

Before we forget, lets update our VENV again.

    source $HOME/.venv/bin/activate
    pip install discord-webhook
    deactivate

Now we can output the AFK Monitor to our private Discord (you do have a private Discord server right? You should. It's free, and a handy place to dump information you want to access from multiple devices, or follow channels from other Discord servers, etc.)

Browse to your install located and copy the example config file as instructed.

Go through the config file and set your default options accordingly. Do not forget to populate the `UserID` variable in the `[Discord]` section if you want to be pinged for critical events.

Great news here, the developer of ED AFK Monitor is ***freaking awesome*** and built in profiles and overrides as a part of the base configuration file AND is adding Commander names to the output in next version.

For the time being, until the next version with Commander names in the output, you will need two separate Discord channels and two webhooks if you want to be able to tell your Commanders apart. So for now go ahead and update the config file at the bottom like so:

    # Custom profiles (advanced)
    # You can set additional profiles to override settings as per the example below
    # Profiles are loaded by passing -p <profilename> via command line or shortcut
    [EDP1]
    Settings.JournalFolder = ""/path/to/your/ED-Logs/EDP1""
    Discord.WebhookURL = ''
    [EDP2]
    Settings.JournalFolder = ""/path/to/your/ED-Logs/EDP2""
    Discord.WebhookURL = ''
    # Loading the above with {afk_monitor.py -p MyAltProfile} will override those two settings
    # This feature is most useful for those with multiple accounts or PCs
    # Note: profile, category and setting names are all case-sensitive

Be sure you actually create and fill in your webhook info.

 and... it is time for one more update to our launch scripts `edp1` and `edp2`

The full `edp1` bash script should look like this:

    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    
    # Environment variables
    export ED_JOURNAL_DIR=""$HOME/games/ED-Logs/EDP1/""
    export STEAM_COMPAT_DATA_PATH=""$HOME/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/EDP1""
    export STEAM_COMPAT_CLIENT_INSTALL_PATH=""$HOME/.local/share/Steam""
    
    VENV=""$HOME/.venv""
    
    # Run MinEdLauncher with arguments
    ""$HOME/games/ed-mods/medl/MinEdLauncher"" \
      ""$HOME/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Proton Hotfix/proton"" \
      run \
      ""$HOME/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Elite Dangerous/EDLaunch.exe"" \
      /novr \
      /autorun \
      /autoquit \
      /edo \
      /frontier \
      edp1 &
    
    # Activate the virtual environment for EDMarketConnector
    echo ""Activating virtual environment...""
    source ""$VENV/bin/activate""
    # --force-localserver-for-auth
    sleep 60
    python ""$HOME/games/ed-mods/edmc/EDMarketConnector.py"" ""--config"" ""$HOME/.local/share/EDMarketConnector/edp1.toml"" &
    sleep 90
    python ""$HOME/games/ed-mods/ED-AFK-Monitor/afk_monitor.py"" ""-p"" ""EDP1"" &
    # The 'deactivate' command is automatically run when the script finishes,
    # because 'source' only affects the current shell execution of the script,
    # not the parent shell that called the script.

Update the `edp2` script as well, and that *should* be all you need to do.

I have launched edp1 from the terminal itself, and from dmenu (a text based launcher for i3wm) and it works fine either way. You can adjust the sleep times as you see fit, I leave plenty of window to launch each part of the process and get into the game.

One final piece, I also wrote a really dirty script to cleanup all ED processes whenI'm done playing.

`vim ~/.local/bin/edquit`

    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    
    killall ""EliteDangerous64.exe""
    kill $(pgrep -f EDMarketConnector.py)
    kill $(pgrep -f afk_monitor.py)

`chmod +x ~/.local/bin/edquit`

It's ugly, but it works. In my defense I was all out of Fs to give by this point.

Anyway... I hope this is useful to even one other person.

I hope I didn't forget any of the steps along the way.

I hope I remember to come back and edit/add anything I did forget.

I hope the coffee pot isn't empty, and is still warm.

I hope you all fly Dangerous.

Thank you for coming to my tED Talk.

1qk180d,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1qk180d/my_34m_fiance_30f_had_a_double_lifeboyfriend_that/,My (34M) Fiance (30F) had a double life/boyfriend that she hid from me for over 2 years. How do I move on from this?,"I broke up with my fiancé 3 weeks ago. We were together for over 8 years. We were due to get married in a few months and start having children. I noticed strange patterns from her over the last couple of years but never had concrete proof of infidelity. These patterns took a toll on our relationship as well because I grew to resent her for how she made me feel. I was getting close to the point of just ending it to avoid feeling like I was losing my mind. 

She started going on spontaneous trips 2 years ago and during these trips would be incredibly invasive. She always had an excuse as to why… It was either a work trip, a family vacation, a trip to take care of her sick grandfather with cancer, the list goes on. She’d then ignore my calls for days and be very slow in responding to any sort of outreach. When I confronted her on this it then became the opposite… She’d become overly communicative as to try and make sure I was not suspicious of anything. Lots of little things at home that I noticed as well like taking 3x longer than it should to run a basic errand, new “male dominated” interests/hobbies, hiding her phone if I walked over, big drop in our sex life, etc… 

On the last trip that she went on she made some mistakes in hiding her infidelity and it opened the floodgates to everything I had wanted to know. These trips were a complete fabrication and she was not even in the state that she told me she was traveling to. She had a fling with a man across the country in a town she used to spend summers with her father in. She was going out and staying at his apartment or they would both meet in a different state and get a hotel to attend a hockey game. This happened at least 6 times that I know of although they were definitely in constant communication while she was with me at our house as well. It was 1000% worse than I could have imagined and I was in total shock. I sat on it for a few weeks while I figured out what I was going to do with my life and that was absolute hell. 

I waited for her to leave again, told her that I know everything via a text message, and that her mother can contact me in regard to picking up all of her things from the house. She didn’t even address all the accusations I laid on her and the proof, she just said she was “so sorry” and that she won’t ever contact me again as per my request. The last day she texted me several times in regard to what she was taking/leaving and that is all I ever heard from her. We spent so much time together and the last thoughts going through her mind were in regards to a $300 coffee table and some dining chairs. 

It’s been 2 weeks now of total no contact and I feel like I am going insane. I can’t sleep, I can barely eat, and all day I run through a million different “what if” scenarios in my head wondering what I could have done differently and trying to reason how she could do such a thing to me. I daydream about all of the ways I can get revenge or some sense of closure and I know its all just pointless. It pains me to say it but I still love her deeply and can’t imagine ever being with another woman. There’s even a part of me that regrets ending it and wishes I just never even found out. Ignorance would be better for me at the moment than the amount of pain I’m in. I dont even know what I am asking here with this post I just wanted to vent a bit as I haven’t told anyone in my circle the extent of her betrayal. Any advice would be appreciated from those who have gone through something similar.",0,1769103838.0,relationship_advice,5,0.5,False

1qk17g7,https://www.reddit.com/r/bluetti/comments/1qk17g7/recommendations_for_home_power_backup/,Recommendations for home power backup,"My home is wired for a generator, as in it has a 30A 240V power “inlet” that feeds into some sort of manual transfer switch (with a physical mains interlock) and powers six circuits, including the water circulation pumps for my home heating (so I can not only keep the house warm, but also keep them from freezing and bursting), and a few other important things (but not the well pump, nor any of the air-conditioning, nor several other systems which long term would be fantastic to also cover).  My home also has about 10kW of solar that doesn’t interact with the backup power (so it stops being useful when mains power goes out).

When I last used this system I was pulling about 600W running the heat and a few odds and ends (LED lighting in a few rooms, some networking gear, a bunch of freezers/fridges).

My generator is loud, and cantankerous, and probably won’t actually run if I need it.

I also have an EV which is roughly 98kWh of battery on wheels and has a 12V DC out and a 1500W120V AC out which will gladly run until it gets down to about 20% state of charge.

In the short term I would love to get something I can hook up to the home’s generator input and feed power into the home, and use the EV’s 1500W 120V AC out to feed into the system to “extend” the life of the whole thing by a few days (\~100 hours, assuming the EV stops feeding power at at 20% charge, and the 130 hour by the easy math turns into more like 100 after some of the power turns into unwanted heat in various inverters).

In the long term it would be nice to be able to do something “smarter” and get the solar inputs and other things as well without wasting whatever equipment I buy in the short term.

In pursuit of my short term goal I think 2x Apex 300 systems and the A1 hub should “work”, and some number of B300 or B500 batteries would give me some “extra buffer” to do power consuming things like run the coffee maker a few times and not worry about using wildly more then my “around 600W” average consumption.  Or also deal with that number coming from reading a little floating dial on the transfer switch, and me not knowing how accurate it actually is, and only looking at it “for a few minutes” “several times” during a 3 day outage which might not have given me an actual good estimate of the average.

Is this a reasonable system for those goals?   What would the longer term system look like, and what would I be managing to make good use of from the short term system, and what would be a waste?   (I’m not utterly opposed to just spending $5k to $7k and getting the short term system and having none of it be useful, but it seems silly if the long term system is say $12k and a professional install cost but none of the short term system gets reused, I ought to just bite the bullet and pay the 3x to 4x more...)",1,1769103804.0,bluetti,0,1.0,False

\- How hard is it to make new friends in LA? I’ve made great friends in NYC, and all my family is in the north east. This would be the hardest part of leaving.

\- I love walking. I don’t mind driving, but love being able to walk to coffee shops, restaurants etc. I understand the driving culture in LA, and would be OK with it as long as my apartment area was walkable.

I thought that by sharing these freaky adventures of mine would help ya'll share yours, because we all joke about shit and cum but no one does the real thing. And currently, I think the sub is even getting away from shit and cum memes, so here's another one to brighten your days.

I usually jerk off 2 to 3 times a day, usually after lunch and before showering. And I also drink a lot of black coffee at the morning and after lunch, making me want to shid daily (keep this information).

So currently in my summer vacation, I've had a lot of time to fap crazy style. Gilfs, futas, femboys, everything that this world has to offer. And in one of my jerking sessions post lunch, after I just drink coffee, I was hard as fuck AND wanting to shid. My body have like a natural clock for both of these things.

So I decided to shit before because this would make the cumming feel better. Shit slipped like pressing an almost empty ketchup bottle, loud and smelly. I even scratch my balls while I shit because the smell lingers on them, and its good.

Then, I went to fap, and if some of you readed that post of mine, ya'll should know that my cumshots are BIG and FAT, just like the GOAT DreamyBull. And to avoid messes, I fap on old socks that I dont use anymore. So I putted on the sock and layed on my bed, I started jorking it. And after just a few minutes, I noticed something warm and sticky on my butt.

Yeah, I didnt wiped enough, or I shat myself while fapping, doesnt matter at this point because it fucking STAINED my bedsheets, like nutella. But I was jerking off and I wouldnt stop until I cum. The only problem of jerking off while standing up in my bedroom was that I didnt realized that I was fully exposed throught my window, wich led to a public street and a gate from a transport company. And when I realized, there was the guard from the company and some cars parked with people watching.

To show off my huge cock to them, I decided to pull of my sock and finish myself off on the window, but my cum landed on the backyard of the first floor, right were my dog uses to shit. Later on that afternoon, my mom gathered up my dog's shit and she said that it had a white, sticky liquid drying on the rocks and near the shit, and she said she think the dog shidded and camed. I just said that meme ""What the dog doin?"" out n loud. She'll never know it was my nuh, and good thing that my nuh didnt landed on the dog 🤣.

So yeah, this was my shid and cum story of today, that happened 4 days ago. I'm already seeing those shocked reaction images and stuff, but if ya'll share your shid and cum stories this time, I would be really glad. Love you all!",4,1769103193.0,shid_and_camed,2,1.0,False

1qk0vwb,https://www.reddit.com/r/midcarder/comments/1qk0vwb/history_of_pro_wrestling_1916_covering_the_climax/,"History of Pro Wrestling - 1916 - covering the climax of Samuel Rachmann’s New York tournament, a massive world title rematch between Joe Stecher & ""Strangler"" Lewis, as well as the potential return of the legendary Frank Gotch!","Hey y’all, we’re back with another look at the colorful history of pro wrestling, this week wrapping up Samuel Rachmann’s international tournament in New York, a rematch between world champion Joe Stecher and Ed “Strangler” Lewis, and the potential return of the legendary Frank Gotch.
 

We covered [1915]( https://www.reddit.com/r/midcarder/s/AnXGy027XL), which covered…
 

**1915 recap**
 

 - Joe Stecher’s crowning victory over Charles Cutler to become the world heavyweight champion.
 - Samuel Rachmann’s ambitious international tournament in New York, where he ran daily events through November and December , with one more month remaining.
 - Jack Curley’s last big boxing event, where he promoted the matchup that saw Jack Johnson’s 2000+ day title reign end in a bout with “Gentleman” Jim Flynn. Curley would focus entirely on pro wrestling moving forward.
 - Mort Henderson’s breakout portrayal of the Masked Marvel, competing in Rachmann’s tournament. The Masked Marvel became must-see by the end of the year, with Jack Curley taking a special interest and attempt to steal away the Marvel for his own shows in New York.
 - Former world heavyweight champion Frank Gotch was eyeing a return to the ring in a championship match with Joe Stecher.

 
 
**Main Characters**

 
Joe Stecher – the undefeated world heavyweight champion, wrestling at a non-stop pace.
 

Ed “Strangler” Lewis – one of the top wrestlers in the country, looking for an avenue into becoming world heavyweight champion.
 

Frank Gotch – former world heavyweight champion, eyeing a return match with current champion, Joe Stecher.

 
Samuel Rachmann – European concert and theater promoter who came to New York to promote an ambitious three-month-long tournament with events running every evening.
 

Jack Curley – pro wrestling promoter based out of New York, looking to establish himself as the top promoter in the territory.

 
Billy Sandow – former pro wrestler-turned-manager, now representing “Strangler” Lewis with goals of Lewis being the top wrestler in the country.

 
As always, its in chronological order, and we will kick the year off right where we left off the previous post, with Samuel Rachmann’s international tournaments entering its third and final month of daily shows at the Manhattan Opera House. Unfortunately for promoter Samuel Rachmann though, his star attraction was about to hit a road bump with a newspaper article in early January.
 

**1916**

 
**Samuel Rachmann’s** international tournament had been holding daily events at the Manhattan Opera House for the past two months, and without question, the breakout star of the tournament was Mort “The Masked Marvel” Henderson, who became a must-see attraction for Rachmann. Its worth noting, that the tournament seemed to operate on a point system, and not a single elimination style matchups. Also, the tournament was contested under the more constricting Greco-Roman rules, as opposed to the catch-as-catch-can style of rules which had become very popular in America in the past decade.

 
**Rachmann’s Tournament**

 
The January 3rd, 1916 edition of the Brooklyn Daily Eagle printed a picture of Mort Henderson, with the caption that read, “The Masked Marvel without his hood.” While its possible that promoter **Jack Curley** had something to do with this, it would also hamper his plans to feature the Masked Marvel, so I doubt that. Considering how popular the tournament was in New York, I wouldn’t be surprised to learn that photographers were trying to snap a picture of him for several weeks at this point. My bet is that some lucky photographer got a good payoff that day.

 
Despite the set-backs, Samuel Rachmann’s tournament continued with a tournament match between **Ed “Strangler” Lewis** and Wladek Zbyszko from January 7th, 1916. The match would be called a draw as the two men wrestled past curfew, according to newspapers. A few days later, on January 10th, Wladek Zbyszko met the Masked Marvel in a tournament match which also went to a draw, after two-and-a-half-hours of grappling. 
 

**The Potential Return of Frank Gotch**

 
As Rachmann’s tournament raged in through the month of January, former world heavyweight champion, **Frank Gotch** was still mulling over a potential match with pro wrestling's current world champion, **Joe Stecher**. For months, news and rumors circulated of a match between the two grapplers. A January 13th newspaper wrote a feature on this, stating that Gotch, “replied yesterday to the offer of a $15,000 purse by Joe Stecher. Gotch replied in effect that he would come out of retirement and wrestle Stecher, provided that he was assured that the public demand such a match.” The article also talked about how a potential match between the two could draw $75,000 - $100,000 if held in Omaha or another mid-west city where Gotch and Stecher were both very popular. 

 
Around the same time, promoter Jack Curley announced a world heavyweight championship match set to headline Madison Square Garden on January 27th, 1916. Although I cant be clear about this, it sounds like Curley was promoting the event as Joe Stecher defending his title against the winner of an upcoming tournament match between “Strangler” Lewis and Wladek Zbyszko.
 

**Sandow’s Claim**
 

Another tournament match would see Ed “Strangler” Lewis defeat Dr Benjamin Roller in New York on January 15th, 1916, and while Roller was the American heavyweight champion, this appears to have been a non-title bout. Why I bring that up is because Lewis’s manager **Billy Sandow** will use the win over Roller to claim Lewis as some disputed “world” champion, specifically referring to Lewis as the “Catch style” champion to a newspaper the following day. Billy Sandow also did a bit of damage control on the first Lewis-Stecher match from the prior summer, saying that the match was stopped only after Stecher broke his thumb in order to escape a bridge from Lewis. The best part of this story is how Sandow claimed that Lewis held Stecher in that bridge from twenty-three minutes before Stecher broke free.

 
A few days later, Billy Sandow would be quoted more by newspapers, where he was attempting to claim Lewis as the legitimate world champion, over Joe Stecher. His reasoning is actually quite simple. He ascertains that Lewis is the legitimate champion, and is able to trace it back to Gotch and Hackenschmidt, basically arguing that the reign of Gus “Americus” Schoenlein isn’t valid. Because when Gotch retired, he allegedly gave the title up to the winner of a match between Henry Ordemann and Jess Westergaard. Ordermann was the winner, but Sandow says that Ordermann lost the title Charles Cutler, who in turn lost it to Dr Benjamin Roller, who then lost to Lewis this year. This is all bullshit, of course, but it’s an example of how promoters, managers, and wrestlers could spin tales to their benefit back in the 1910s.

 
**Rachmann-Curley**

 
Speaking of the tournament, the breakout star, Mort “The Maske Marvel” Henderson abruptly quit the tournament altogether and informed Rachmann that Jack Curley had offered him more than ten times his weekly salary for one big match at Madison Square Garden at the end of the month. For anyone impressed by this, its important to remember that Henderson was an unknown wrestler who was being paid a paultry $100 per week. Despite being under contract, Henderson stopped showing up for his tournament matches and eventually Rachmann hit Henderson with an injunction, just two days before he was scheduled for Jack Curley’s big Garden show.

 
**Tournament Finals**

 
Samuel Rachmann’s tournament would wrap up by the end of January, after nearly twelve weeks of nightly matches. Worth noting, would be that Ed “Strangler” Lewis dropped out of the tournament after exchanging a win and loss in back-to-back matches with Wladek Zbyszko. The tournament finals would be fought on January 24th, 1916, between Wladek Zbyszko and Alex Aberg, who claimed to be the Greco-Roman champion at the time. Alex Aberg isn’t a name I have detailed much through these reports, but he has been present through the story all the same. 

 
Alex Aberg was a thirty-five-year-old from Kolga, Estonia who had been wrestling throughout the world for the past fifteen years, and by all accounts, he was described by his peers as one of the very best mat grapplers in the world. Standing at six feet tall and over two hundred and thirty pounds, Aberg was a well-respected and legitimate shooter. He has held the claim of Greco-Roman world champion for several years, stating that he won the belt back in 1903, and had been defending it against all comers in the New York area for years. Its not a really a claim worth tracing though, because several different wrestlers all over the world claimed to be the Greco-Roman world champion through the previous decade.

 
Alex Aberg and Wladek Zbyszko met in the Samuel Rachmann tournament finals on January 24th, 1916, with Aberg being declared the winner after a controversial finish. About twenty-five minutes into the match, Aberg tossed Zbyszko out of the ring where he reportedly crashed hard into the back of the stage. After calling a doctor, Zbyszko determined that he was hurt and unable to continue the match, as fans screamed at him, calling Zbyszko a “quitter” and a “fake.” Although the doctor said Zbyszko was fit to continue, Zbyszko refused, insisting that he was hurt. After nearly an hour of deliberations, the referee of the bout, George Bothner announced Alex Aberg as the winner.

 
**Curley’s Madison Square Garden Show**

 
Getting back to Jack Curley’s upcoming Madison Square Garden event, remember how Curley announced that world champion Joe Stecher would defend his belt against the winner of a matchup between Wladek Zbyszko and Ed “Strangler” Lewis? Well since then, Zbyszko and Lewis wrestled twice and both registered a win over the other, and while the general public would be more interested in a potential Lewis-Stecher rematch, Lewis and his manager Billy Sandow already left town to tour with their made-up world title claim. Wladek would make sense, but he just lost a high-profile match to Alex Aberg, so Curley didn’t want to match up Stecher with someone who the public just witnessed lose a big bout, leaving Curley with little options.

 
I’m sure most of you are already wondering why Alex Aberg wouldn’t be selected for this world title opportunity, and that will be because Alex Aberg specifically wrestles his matches under Greco-Roman rules, whereas most modern (for 1916) matches at the time were fought under the less constricting Catch-As-Catch-Can style of rules. Catch wrestling was freer and faster compared to Greco-Roman, and Aberg had little interest in expanding his skill-set, so Curley needed to find an alternative. That left only one real option for Curley to match up against Joe Stecher, against the breakout star of Rachmann’s tournament, the Masked Marvel, Mort Henderson. Remember, Rachmann had already tried to oppose this by filing an injunction that specifically named the Masked Marvel and “Strangler” Lewis as being unable to leave the tournament in favor of Curley’s promoted events in New York. Curley didn’t take this lightly and fought the injections, leading to a suit between the two promoters.

 
Just like Jack Curley and Ole Marsh exposed the business in Seattle, five years prior, the resulting suit, which was reported on by all major New York papers, also exposed the business. The suit named Henderson as the Marvel and revealed that his contract with Rachmann called for Henderson to win and lose matches as directed. Luckily for Curley, who faced the prospect of replacing his main attraction on two days notice, both he and Rachmann were able to come to terms and the injunction was dropped. No details are given beyond the fact that Curley and Rachmann spent hours deliberating with their lawyers until some agreement was made between the two promoters that allowed Curley to use Henderson in his show, even advertising him as the Masked Marvel.

 
On January 27th, 1916, Curley’s Madison Square Garden show went as planned, with thousands in attendance for the main event that pitted the Masked Marvel Mort Henderson against the current world champion from Nebraska, Joe Stecher. Stetcher would dominate the best two of three falls contest, pinning Henderson in back-to-back falls in less than fifteen minutes. With this show a success, Curley had firmly established his own foothold in Manhattan, making the city his new base of operations going forward.

 
With Samuel Rachman’s tournament wrapped up, the tournament winner Alex Aberg officially accepted a $5,000 check on January 29th, 1916. The end of the tournament would signal the end of any interest in Greco-Roman style wrestling matches, and the end of Samuel Rachmann’s promotional career in pro wrestling. Rachmann, seemingly having enough of pro wrestling, never attempted to get back into the wrestling business. Though he only spent long enough in the business to have a cup of coffee, his influence on the product going forward cannot be overstated. Judging by what we have covered, Rachmann would have fit right in with a lot modern performers.

 
**Struggles of Jim Londos**

 
As we wrap up the big tournament in New York, lets travel across the country to look in on a twenty-two-year-old Jim Londos. Londos spent the first several months of the year criss-crossing the Northwest, picking up work where he could and using his railroad skills/ knowledge to hitchhike from town to town on freight trains. Londos struggled through this time period, one time even travelling for hours to Dallas, Oregon, to wrestle Ted Thye for what he thought was a $75.00 payout. It was actually just $0.75 payout though, leaving him in the red for that trip. Londos lost two straight falls for the first time in his career to Canadian Jack Taylor on February 24th, 1915, in Spokane, Washington. Londos would attempt to dispute the second fall, arguing to newspapers the following day that his shoulder was actually off of the mat during the alleged pin. Londos would spend the next several months struggling to make any real income worth talking about.

 
**The Strangler’s Return to New York**

 
Ed “Strangler” Lewis and Billy Sandow seemingly gave up on Lewis’s false championship claim pretty quickly, as they were back in New York by March, with no indication that Lewis was still claiming to be any kind of champion. Lewis would compete at a Jack Curley promoted event at Madison Square Garden on March 6th, 1916, in a ridiculous seven-on-one handicap match! I’m assuming it was a gauntlet-style match of one guy after another, but the rules stated that Lewis needed to register seven falls in under sixty minutes! The crazy part is that Lewis accomplished this feat, defeating Hans Fuerst, Herman Shilling, Albert Mueller, Carl Vogel, Carl Nelson, George Bailey, and another unnamed wrestler that evening. Billy Sandow was clearly pulling out all the stops in order to get Lewis over as a world champion contender and secure that rematch with Stecher.
 

**Booking Gotch vs Stecher**

 
Even though he had been retired for several years by 1916, the pro wrestling world wouldn’t stop buzzing over the prospect of Frank Gotch challenging Joe Stecher for the world title that Gotch never lost. Joe Stecher was seen as the dream opponent for Gotch, as Stecher seemed to fit neatly into the mold Gotch had left as a performer. A simple Midwesterner with a no-nonsense approach and a body said to have been made strong by his farm work. Stecher won his matches quickly and consistently, and was dubbed, “The Scissors King” in homage to his most popular hold, in which Stecher would trap his opponents chest between his legs and squeeze them to defeat, or just hold them on the ground pinning them easily. Jack Curley saw big potential in Joe, and would later tell the New York Evening Journal, “Don’t make any mistake on this fellow. I’ve been in the wrestling game many a year, and he’s the greatest I ever saw-bar none.” Just like Gotch-Hackenschmidt from years prior, there was a bidding war of sorts to be the one to land and stage the potential Gotch-Stecher bout. 

 
An unnamed Chicago promoter reportedly offered Gotch $25,000 for the fight, but Gotch refused unless he was paid at least $35,000. Jack Curley, having set up a home-base in New York, attempted to bring Gotch and Stecher to Manhattan, but Gotch refused, on the grounds that it would draw better if it’s done somewhere in the Midwest. The winning bid, came from Gene Melady, a prominent promoter in Nebraska, who made a deal with Curley, that would see both men hold the match in Omaha. Its worth noting that there are conflicting reports of how much Melady paid to secure the deal, with various sources ranging anywhere from $15,000 - $50,000. Obviously, we have no way to verify the information.

 
Gene Melady was a former amateur boxer and college football standout as part of Notre Dame’s first football squad, after which he made a fortune dealing in livestock. Melady was able to entice both Gotch and Stecher into the offer, by promising to build a stadium in time to host the event on Labor Day. Another Labor Day payday for Gotch it would seem, who previously made history and set gate records with George Hackenschmidtin over Labor Day weekend in 1911. Melady on the other hand, was hoping to one-up that event with a $150,000 gate, which would be the biggest pro wrestling had ever seen up to that point. 

 
**Return to the Ring**

 
Frank Gotch agreed to a seven month long tour to hype and promote the match, and would wrestle several exhibition bouts with friendly competition. The first match back for the former world heavyweight champion came on March 10th, 1916, and against William Demetral, in Los Angeles. Gotch’s long-time friend and peer Dan McLeod served as the guest referee for the match, which would see Frank Gotch be declared the winner. Two days later on March 12th, Gotch would wrestle again, this time in San Diego in a special handicap match against three other men! Unsurprisingly, Gotch would be declared the victor over his opponents, Herman Stretch, Sam Chapham, and Jack White.

 
While Frank Gotch agreed to a seven month long tour to build interested in the bout, and get him back in ring shape, Joe Stecher was looking to bide his own time with a rematch the fans were clamoring for, against Ed “Strangler” Lewis.

 
**Number One Contender “Strangler” Lewis**

 
Through the first half of 1916, Billy Sandow only got more proactive in his efforts to secure his client, Ed “Strangler” Lewis another world title match, and really began to push for that rematch in the spring and summer of 1916. In order to capitalize on the publicity that came from Samuel Rachmann’s tournament, Sandow would secure a match for Lewis against the tournament’s breakout star, the Masked Marvel, Mort Henderson. “Strangler” Lewis would meet The Masked Marvel at Madison Square Garden on May 2nd, 1916, with Lewis going over in the main event contest of the night. 

 
After months of campaigning, Sandow and Lewis would finally get their wish, as Joe Stecher formally agreed to a rematch with Lewis and set the contest for July. Before we get to that though, its worth pointing out that promoter Gene Melady’s ambitious plans of having a new stadium constructed in Omaha proved to be too tall of an order to follow through on. Out of a concern for losing the high profile bout between Stecher and Gotch, Melady would partner with the owners of the Sells-Floto circus to secure proper finances to pay for the bout. Frank Gotch officially signed the deal for a future match with Stecher on June 13th, 1916. Before Stecher can look at Gotch in the Fall though, he first needed to overcome a rematch with “Strangler” Lewis scheduled for the following month.

 
**Lewis-Stecher**

 
On July 4th, 1916, in Omaha, Nebraska, Joe Stecher once again got into the ring with “Strangler” Ed Lewis, in a match that is best remembered for miserable weather and miserable contest. It was an outdoor event, with a tarp to block the sun for the wrestlers, but the fans were stuck in the sweltering heat for a rematch title bout that was over two hours long. 

 
Just like their previous encounter, this was a dull affair with “Strangler” Lewis mostly looking to avoid all of Joe’s attempts to lock up. Several locals had bet large sums of money that Joe would beat Lewis in under an hour, with some even betting that Joe would win two straight falls. Lewis’s manager, Billy Sandow remembers this, later recalling how “Those Nebraska chaps, loaded with Eastern money they had won previously on Stecher against some of the best in the country, had bet wildly.” When that first hour passed, and those bets turned into losses, many in the crowd turned hostile towards both competitors and started heckling and jeering the contest.

 
The events promoter, Gene Melady didn’t plan for it to go past sundown, considering the bout started at 4pm. So as the slow plodding match entered its third hour, and they began to lose daylight, Gene realized that fans in attendance had no way to view the action. Gene actually got up and suggested they pause the match and resume it in the morning, but the crowd responded so negatively to the suggestion, that Gene immediately got crew members to stand on ladders and hold lanterns up high.

 
The match was so boring, that the only moment of action happened when some children lit off fireworks in the middle of the grandstand. Finally, after 9pm, referee Ed Smith shut the match down. Ed was quoted as hilariously saying “In the name of humanity, the match is over.” Fans would later claim that there was maybe thirty seconds of actual wrestling during the five hour contest where Stecher and Lewis stayed locked up and slowly moved around the ring for hours. Brutal. The fans in attendance apparently threw garbage and bottles at the wrestlers following the end of the match.

 
The press articles and journalists following the matches painted Lewis as the one to blame for the plodding match and was accused of “stalling” at various points. At this time, an immediate rematch was out of the question, as Frank Gotch was about to come out of retirement to challenge the Stecher for that world title, in a proposed dream match. 
 

On his match with Stecher, Lewis would later be quoted saying, “We wrestled five hours without either of us securing a fall. At the end of the bout, which was halted by the referee, Stecher appeared to be all in. His pulse was 115, and according to those who witnessed the encounter, he could not have stood the strain ten minutes longer. I offered Stecher a return match, but he refused to accept it, saying he was through with me. I cannot account for his statement, as I always gave him a square deal in every one of our matches. I intend to rest up during the summer months, getting back into the game sometime in September. If Gotch retires, as he says he will, and Stecher makes good on his statement that he will not wrestle with me again, I will lay claim to the heavyweight title.” That was Lewis basically saying that when Gotch retires again, Lewis intends to announce himself as the world champion, regardless of what Stecher’s claim will be then.

 
Billy Sandown would later be quoted when speaking on this match, saying, “Stecher was hardly known outside of Omaha. He had, however, thrown every man he had met inside of 15 minutes. Out that way, he was thought unbeatable, and they said the man didn’t live who could stay an hour with him. They met in the open air under a boiling Nebraska sun. After five-and-one-half hours of wrestling, without either man being off his feet once, folks began to run automobiles up to the ring so they could throw their headlights on the men, that they might see each other. At this late day they were just beginning to realize what a great match that was. Now, but they didn’t then. They held Lewis’s money up for four days on the grounds that there was something shady with the match. They couldn’t believe that mortal man could stay beyond half an hour with their Joe. To show the stuff that Strangler’s made of, let me add that Lewis took a shower, had a light supper and danced until 4:30 the next morning.

 
A week later, on July 12th, 1916, Ed “Strangler” Lewis and his manager Billy Sandow put up a $1,000 bond in an attempt to coax a match out of Frank Gotch. They were probably hoping to benefit from the publicity surrounding the upcoming Gotch-Stecher bout. Unfortunately for Lewis and Sandow, their challenge would go unanswered, and a match between Gotch and Lewis would never take place.

 
**Heartbreaking End for Gotch**

 
Speaking of Gotch, leading up to the big match in September, he had agreed to a tour the country for seven months, to get into ring shape and build interest in the bout, and for his participation, Gotch would be paid $30,000 for the tour alone. Unfortunately, it was clear from the very first dates that Gotch was a changed man, and his weight started to plummet a month into the tour, to which Gotch was quoted at the time saying “There is something radically wrong with me.” Gotch would panic and leave the tour to recover, and after a month, Gotch returned and got back to his scheduled matches. Seemingly satisfied with his condition, Gotch decided to press on with the planned bout with Stecher.

 
During this resumed tour, on July 18th, Frank Gotch arrived in Kenosha, Wisconsin for a public training match with Bob Managoff. Unfortunately, during their friendly skirmish, Gotch’s foot became tangled between the two ring mats during a scuffle, and the speed of Gotch’s movement snapped his left fibula. Gotch fell to the mat in legitimate shock and had to be carried out of the ring and into a waiting car. Bob Managoff would later recount this day, remembering how “the people booed. They thought Frank was faking.” Reminds me of Bret Hart breaking his sternum, being unable to stand, but could hear several people in the front row calling him a fake.

 
Frank Gotch would later sit in a hospital bed and tell reporters, “It happened so quickly that I had no chance to see what was happening.” Gotch headed back home to recover, and unfortunately his weight would drastically drop again, eliminating any chance for the potential Gotch-Stecher bout. Frank Gotch’s wrestling career, was effectively over.

 
**Retirement & Time Off**

 
And just for old times sake, Frank Gotch’s retirement was again formally announced by the Washington Post, on July 23rd, when they announced Gotch was returning home to his farm. Gotch was quoted in the article, saying, “I am done for good. I think it is time for any man to retire when he is 40 and from now on I don’t care who has the wrestling championship.” Gotch also said that his son will not be a wrestler or a boxer, but a “champion lawyer of the State of Iowa.”

 
Without a blockbuster bout, world champion Joe Stecher found himself in a rare moment of solace and peace. He was only twenty three years old, but he had been going hard in the pro wrestling game for the past four years. In his time off that summer, Stecher was able to get married and enjoy his honeymoon before being thrust back into the role of pro wrestling’s reigning world champion. 

 
The Milwaukee Journal published an article on July 25th, 1916, talking about the state of the major players in pro wrestling, and specifically, Ed “Strangler” Lewis. The article wrote that, “Lewis, who with Joe Stecher is the logical claimant of worlds wrestling honors now that Frank Gotch has come out with a statement that he is through with the mat game… he (Lewis) will appear in motion pictures, taking the part of Hector in a movie play called The Iliad.” Along with his movie aspirations, the article would go onto say that, “If Gotch retires, as he says he will, and Stecher makes good on his statement that he will not wrestle Lewis again then Lewis will lay claim to the heavyweight wrestling title.”

 
**A Break for Londos**

 
Jim Londos spent the summer of 1916 working as part of the C.W. Parker carnival shows, where he issued open challenges for anyone in the audience to try and survive in the ring with him. Londos got this job through Pete Buzukos, and apparently Londos wrestled under the ring name of “Jimmy Sampson,” or sometimes just “Young Samson.”

 
Dutch Mantell would help secure Londos a spot wrestling in Nebraska in the autumn of 1916, specifically in Falls City, where Londos would spend the next several months wrestling under the ring name “George Polk” and then in December Londos was wrestling under the ring name Julian Reif in Great Bend, Kansas. The multiple names was done so Londos could wrestle the same guy over and over again in different venues, with the promote claiming he has a wide variety of talent at his disposal. To highlight how profitable it could be, Londos reportedly beat Bob Managoff three times in under two names in December of 1916.

 
**Olin-Stecher**

 
Stecher's first match back following his marriage and honeymoon was on December 11th, 1916, in Springfield, Massachusetts. Stecher was facing a wrestler from Finland, John Olin, who the locals had taken a shine to. Olin didn't expect to win but was hoping to put on an entertaining crowd for Olin's local fans. Stecher didn't get the memo, unfortunately and walked into this bout looking to fight for his life. 
 

For all his popularity with fans, Stecher had a reputation with the boys as being uncooperative, and on this night, John Olin and the fans of Springfield saw this first hand. The match was messy, with Stecher looking to quickly dispatch Olin and the challenger instead choosing to fight off literally every single attempt at offence from Stecher. The bout would finally end, several hours later, at past 1am, with Olin and Stecher outside the ring, and trading legit punches in the front row. A frustrated Stecher would just walk off and take a DQ loss.

 
While this match may seem inconsequential at first glance, it will have massive ramifications on the pro wrestling scene in America for the next several years. Despite being a disqualification finish, John Olin did register a victory of the world heavyweight champion, and John Olin would never attempted to make a claim to the world title off this, that wont necessarily stop someone else who defeats Olin from making such a claim to be world champion. But, more on that in the next post. 

 
**And that’s a perfect place to stop, with...**


 - Joe Stecher still reigning as world heavyweight champion, though the grind of touring as champion has begun to wear him down.
 - Ed ""Strangler"" Lewis in his endless pursuit of a world title claim, by hook or crook, alongside his manager Billy Sandow.
 - Frank Gotch's final retirement from pro wrestling, as his health began to worsen.
 - John Olin's disqualification victory over Joe Stecher will have massive ramifications as we head into 1917.
 - Jack Curley firmly established as a top match-maker in the New York market.


**Championship History (1916)**

 
**World Heavyweight Championship**


Joe Stecher, July 7th, 1915 - next post.

 
**American Heavyweight Championship**

 
Dr Benjamin Roller (**3**), October 7th, 1914 – next post


Im sure some of have noticed the American heavyweight title has basically disappeared from the conversation by this point. That is mostly due to the fact that with the legitimate world title, general interest in the American title evaporated pretty quickly. The next post will see us officially finish up with the title with one final title change. 


I will be back next week with 1917, as well as a spotlight post that looks at the entire International Tournament hosted by Samuel Rachmann through 1915 & 1916. Im nearly done with Natalya Neidhart's book as well and will have a couple posts on that, but between running a restaurant and being a new dad, finding time with a book is a tall task!

1qk0vkq,https://www.reddit.com/r/DatingInIndia/comments/1qk0vkq/need_womens_perspective_workplace_crush_and/,"Need women’s perspective, workplace crush and trying not to mess it up","Hi, I’m posting because I’m genuinely confused and could really use a woman’s perspective. I’m 21( she's 22, if that even matters ) and honestly pretty inexperienced with dating. This is the first time I’ve felt like this about someone at all, so I’m trying to move slowly and be respectful instead of impulsive. A few weeks ago during group work for a presentation at my internship, I ended up spending a lot of time with a female colleague. We worked closely, talked a lot, and the conversations flowed easily. I realized I liked her not just physically but because she’s confident, articulate, and easy to be around. After the project ended, I assumed everything would just go back to normal and that the closeness was probably situational. But since then she’s still been warm and normal with me, has initiated conversations a few times, and there hasn’t been any awkward avoidance. Recently she mentioned that the food at her PG is bad and that she sometimes eats breakfast at the office. My PG food is bad too, so later I called her for some work related clarification and mentioned it. During that call she said that if I’m having breakfast at the office, we could go together. I agreed, and she replied pretty enthusiastically saying she’ll call me in the morning. This is honestly the first time in my life I’m doing a one on one thing like this with a woman, so I’m nervous but trying to stay grounded. What’s confusing me is that I don’t know if she’s single or dating someone. She has male friends at work and spends time with a group, but I genuinely can’t tell what the situation is. I don’t want to mistake friendliness for romantic interest, but I also don’t want to be so afraid that I never express interest at all. My intention isn’t to rush or pressure her. I was thinking of asking her out for something simple like coffee at some point, once things feel a bit more stable, and only once, respectfully. From a woman’s point of view, does this sound like normal friendliness or like someone who might be open to getting to know me more? Is it okay to ask someone out once in this context even if I don’t know their relationship status? Are there any red flags here that I might be missing? I’m genuinely trying to handle this in a mature way and not overthink myself into paralysis, so I’d really appreciate honest advice.
TL;DR: Got close to a coworker during project work, things still feel warm and normal, she suggested we get breakfast together, I like her but don’t know if she’s single. Is it reasonable to ask her out once or am I overthinking friendliness?",2,1769103084.0,DatingInIndia,0,1.0,False

1qk0ung,https://www.reddit.com/r/Schizoid/comments/1qk0ung/can_any_of_you_relate_to_this/,Can any of you relate to this?,"I am a former victim services secretary & a current criminal justice employee. 

At my secretary job I worked for a state department that provided financial assistance to victims and their families. It required no interaction with the public outside of copy paste emails. The victims would send us documents through email. These documents would sometimes contain crime scene photos. 

I was one of the only secretaries that could handle the crime scene photos. You had to look at the entire document because sometimes other things would be bundled in there that you had to separate. The emails containing homicide photographs would be assigned to me because I didn't really get disturbed by it. I had enough emotional detachment that I was rather apathetic about it. 

I don't seek out gore. I don't enjoy looking at it. But when it is presented to me in a work setting like this I don't have an emotional reaction. I do what I have to do. Same thing for the pretty horrific crimes we had to read about & the victim letters we'd receive. I never wished harm on any of these people. I was efficient in my job so they could receive the help they needed. But at the same time I could read about how a man annihilated his entire family and sleep well at night. 

My efficiency got me recognized in the criminal justice sector and I was plucked out of that job & put in a new one. I handle post conviction processes & I'm one of the people responsible for determining the conditions of an offender's probation. I do not have an emotional reaction to their crimes. I can read about some pretty nasty stuff & talk about it like I'm talking about getting my morning coffee. But I also have an awareness that I need to keep the guy who raped a kid from being able to work at a daycare or going to a playground. 

The sex offenders & people with sex crimes convictions who aren't sex offenders hate to see me coming. I do not play about them. But I'm also emotionally detached from their crimes & their victims. I will do what I can to prevent more victims while they're on probation. But I am apathetic about the circumstances that got them locked up in the first. 

Does this feel familiar to anybody else? Like you are pretty apathetic to human suffering but you also do what you can to prevent it? It's a strange thing. ",4,1769103027.0,Schizoid,3,1.0,False

1qk0rhp,https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1qk0rhp/vinyl_listening_became_my_best_productivity_hack/,Vinyl listening became my best productivity hack by accident,"This wasn't intentional at all but vinyl completely changed how I structure my wfh days where morning coffee record sets the vibe for focused work, lunch break flip creates a natural pause, evening wind down with something chill helps transition out of work mode.

The 15-20 minute sides force natural time blocks because you can't just zone out for 4 hours with autoplay running, you have to actively engage and flip sides which breaks up the day. Also way less screen time because you're listening to physical media instead of staring at spotify which helps with the digital fatigue everyone talks about.

I started with albums I already liked, now I’ve been getting new “mixtape” kind of ones through vinyl moon who always curate a great vibe. Sounds simple but the physical ritual of it makes a difference imo, screen-based productivity systems never stuck for me but this has been consistent for months now.

Anyone else use analog stuff to manage wfh better?",0,1769102839.0,remotework,1,0.5,False
1qk0re8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qk0re8,Help Me Re-Design My Boring Living Room,"I am trying to redesign our somewhat awkwardly shaped living room! I plan to buy at least a new coffee table, couch, and console, but I'm also thinking of a new chair and open to suggestions. 

The wood burning stove creates some awkwardness in the space, but we love it! I had previously posted asking for advice on what to put in the awkward window corner, but now there's more at play.

My finance does not like where his recliner sits currently, but I am struggling to think of a better location. Our couch also feels too big, and I'm not too keen on having a floating coach. 

Our priority is comfort and usability, as we spend a lot of time in this room. I tend to sacrifice aesthetic in favor of comfort, but I am trying to find the balance. 

One note: we don't want to put the TV in the window corner since it would overheat when we use the stove and would block some of our only natural light. And I know we need more art!

1qk0q2z,https://www.reddit.com/r/StoryTimeLanguage/comments/1qk0q2z/how_to_create_languagelearning_story_prompts_that/,How to Create Language-Learning Story Prompts That Match Your Needs,"Crafting personalized story prompts is one of the most effective ways to tailor your language-learning experience. By focusing on dialogues or scenes that reflect real-life situations, you can practice vocabulary and phrases that are most relevant to your needs. Whether you’re just starting out with basic greetings or preparing for a professional presentation, personalized story prompts can help you master essential phrases in a way that feels meaningful and engaging.

In this post, we’ll guide you through using **StoryTime Language** to create prompts in your native language that teach you what you need to know in your target language. We’ll provide tips, examples, and a list of potential prompts to get you started.

 

**Why Personalized Prompts Are So Effective**

1. **Context Matters: Practicing vocabulary and phrases in realistic scenarios makes them easier to remember and apply in real life.**
2. **Relevant Practice: You’ll focus on the specific words and sentences you’re most likely to use, such as for a doctor’s appointment or a business meeting.**
3. **Adaptable for All Levels: Whether you’re an A1 beginner or a B2 advanced learner, personalized prompts can grow with you.**

 

**How to Start Creating Prompts**

The best way to create a story prompt is to target a specific area of your life where you know you’ll need language skills. For example:

* Living in a foreign country provides constant opportunities to learn, but also unique challenges.
* One of my earliest struggles in Spain was setting up a water bill with a company that only handled inquiries over the phone—a difficult place to try out my language skills!

Here’s how you can create a personalized prompt:

1. **Describe the Scenario: Think about a real-life situation you’ll encounter, like setting up a utility bill, meeting new people, or giving a presentation.**
2. **Define Your Goals: What do you want to learn? For example, specific vocabulary, cultural nuances, or phrases to help navigate the scenario.**
3. **What You’ll Gain: A story or dialogue that mirrors real-life interactions, teaches context-specific vocabulary, and builds your confidence by role-playing the situation.**

 

**How to Create Prompts for Your Language Level**

**1. Beginners (A1): Focus on Basic Vocabulary and Greetings**

At the A1 level, your prompts should cover simple phrases, everyday vocabulary, and essential grammar.

* **Examples of Scenarios**:
   * Meeting someone for the first time.
   * Ordering food at a café.
   * Shopping for groceries.
* **Example Prompt in Native Language**:   *“Write a story where two characters meet for the first time and greet each other. Include a simple conversation about the weather and their hobbies.”*
* **How StoryTime Language Helps**:    The app generates basic stories with clear, beginner-friendly dialogue to help you practice essentials.

 

**2. Lower Intermediate (A2): Practice Everyday Conversations**

At this level, you’ll want prompts that involve slightly more complex scenarios, like giving directions or making plans.

* **Examples of Scenarios**:
   * Asking for directions in a new city.
   * Describing your weekend plans to a friend.
   * Talking about your daily routine.
* **Example Prompt in Native Language**:   *“Write a story where one character asks another for directions to the train station. Include a conversation about nearby landmarks.”*
* **How StoryTime Language Helps**:    Generate realistic dialogues with vocabulary and phrases you can use immediately.

 

**3. Intermediate (B1): Expand Vocabulary for Specific Topics**

At the B1 level, focus on prompts that help you prepare for specific situations, such as a doctor’s appointment, a job interview, or planning a trip.

* **Examples of Scenarios**:
   * Visiting the doctor and describing symptoms.
   * Preparing a presentation at work.
   * Discussing travel plans at the airport.
* **Example Prompt in Native Language**:   *“Write a story where a character visits the doctor. Include dialogue where they describe their symptoms and ask questions about treatments.”*
* **How StoryTime Language Helps**:    Tailor prompts to your needs, and the app creates stories that include the vocabulary and grammar you’ll encounter in real life.

 

**4. Advanced (B2 and Above): Focus on Complex Situations**

Advanced learners should craft prompts around nuanced conversations or specialized topics, such as debates, technical subjects, or cultural discussions.

* **Examples of Scenarios**:
   * Negotiating a deal in a business meeting.
   * Debating a cultural topic with friends.
   * Explaining a technical process in detail.
* **Example Prompt in Native Language**:   *“Write a story where a character presents a new idea at work. Include dialogue where they answer questions from colleagues.”*
* **How StoryTime Language Helps**:    Generate advanced stories that challenge your vocabulary, grammar, and cultural understanding.

 

**Prompt Ideas for Real-Life Scenarios**

Here are some prompts to help you practice the vocabulary and phrases you need:

1. **Basic Daily Life:**
   * **“Write a story where a character goes shopping for groceries and asks about prices and quantities.”**
   * **“Create a dialogue between two people meeting at a party and introducing themselves.”**
2. **Travel:**
   * **“Write a story about a traveler checking into a hotel and asking about amenities.”**
   * **“Create a dialogue at an airport where someone asks for help with their luggage.”**
3. **Healthcare:**
   * **“Write a story where a patient describes their symptoms to a doctor and discusses possible treatments.”**
   * **“Create a dialogue where someone calls to schedule a dentist appointment.”**
4. **Work and Professional Life:**
   * **“Write a story where a character gives a presentation at work and answers questions from the audience.”**
   * **“Create a dialogue between two colleagues discussing a project deadline.”**
5. **Social and Cultural:**
   * **“Write a story where a character explains a holiday tradition to a friend.”**
   * **“Create a dialogue about planning a birthday party.”**

 

**How to Use StoryTime Language for Custom Prompts**

1. **Open the App: Navigate to the “Create a Story” section.**
2. **Write Your Prompt: Describe your scenario in detail. For example:**
   * ***“Write a story where a character orders a coffee at a café and asks about menu options.”***
3. **Select Your Target Language: Choose the language you’re learning.**
4. **Choose Your Proficiency Level: Pick A1–C2 to match your current skill level.**
5. **Generate the Story: The app will create a personalized story with dialogue, vocabulary, and cultural context.**

 

**Final Thoughts**

By creating personalized story prompts, you can focus on the language skills you need most. Whether you’re preparing for a real-world scenario or just expanding your vocabulary, **StoryTime Language** makes it easy to generate stories that are engaging, relevant, and tailored to your needs.

	Later that evening, Harold helped Marjorie out of bed and to the living room, where they usually spent time together talking or playing a board game. However, this activity became less enjoyable with each passing day and the progression of her pregnancy. The increased pain and fatigue that she felt made any task difficult.

“It’ll be stormy tonight,” Harold said as he walked over to the couch where Marjorie was laying. “At least that’s what I heard on the radio today.” He reached over her and pushed the heavy brown curtain to the side then looked out. “I don’t see it though.” Looking around for a little longer, he let the heavy curtain drop back in place releasing a cloud of dust that danced in the light of the table lamp.

Marjorie’s eyes were closed and he figured that a good conversation was probably out of the question tonight so he sat down at the other end of the couch. Gently lifting her feet, he rested them on his lap and began to softly massage one, starting at its base and slowly moving to the toes. His grip was firm but soft and he was careful not to move her foot too much so he wouldn’t cause more discomfort. 

Harold smiled at Marjorie as he thought about the last seven years of marriage. Her long brown hair was lying loosely over her shoulders accented by the red in her dress. His eyes wandered down over her swollen breasts and to her pregnant belly that was stretching her dress to its limit. His smile grew as he considered the idea that the baby beneath his wife’s stretched skin would soon be born and add another layer of love in the home. Moving his eyes from the top of her head to her toes, he couldn’t believe how her tiny frame could support the pregnancy. “You know Mrs. Faller, I think you’re the most beautiful thing I’ve ever set my eyes on.” Harold maintained his smile and looked at her eyes in search of a response, but they were closed. He continued looking at her as his thoughts wandered and he mindlessly continued massaging her foot. 

“Ouch!” Marjorie yelped and reflexively jerked her foot forward, kicking Harold in the stomach. “That hurt.”  

“Sorry Honey, I was just trying to…” 

“It’s not like I’m in enough pain already,” Marjorie interrupted. She frowned at him while he carefully pulled her feet back onto his lap.

“I’m sorry, but I was just thinking about you and I guess I just wasn’t paying attention.” Harold picked up her foot and kissed the top of it gently. “Better?”

“No.” She answered stiffly with a frown. 

Flashing her a smile, Harold began gently massaging her foot again. He noticed that her feet were so swollen that the lightest touch would leave an indentation. In a steady motion he slowly slid his hands from the bottom of her foot to the top of her ankle and back.  “How are you feeling, now?”

“Not good,” she answered.

“Is the pain still there?”

Marjorie’s eyes began to glisten. “Yes, it’s still there.” 

“It’s that bad?”  

“Yes,” she said as a single tear rolled down her cheek and onto her dress.  

Harold knew that tears had always been a source of release for Marjorie, but couldn’t understand why it made her feel any better. Crying never did much for him, but everyone was different. “I’m sorry that it’s so bad,” he said while switching her feet on his lap and beginning to massage the new one. He leaned back against the arm of the couch and asked, “have you felt the baby lately?”

“I don’t know, I mean I can’t tell, I’m just really sore.” Her eyes winced as she felt another shot of pain. Marjorie took a deep breath and leaned her head on the couch pillow in an attempt to get comfortable. “Yesterday was the same. I think it’ll be soon.”

Harold felt his stomach tighten and he became rigid with heightened alarm. “Soon?” he repeated. 

Although in discomfort, Marjorie playfully pushed his chest with her feet.  “Relax, what I mean is that it could be sometime soon.”  

“Very funny, but you will tell me in advance that we should head to the hospital, right?” Harold said with a smirk.

“I hope so,” she said and then closed her eyes as another surge of pain rushed her. 

Harold lifted Marjorie’s legs and slid closer to her. He rested her thighs on his lap and asked, “Do you really feel it’ll be soon?” A smile slowly formed as he pressed his left hand on her calf.  Slowly he moved his hand under the hem of her dress, over her knee and up her thigh. 

“Men,” she said. “I’m here about to burst open and you’re trying to feel me up.” Marjorie shook her head at Harold. “Listen Romeo, is Shannon still awake?”

“Not sure.” Harold glanced down the hallway and noticed light seeping through the bottom of Shannon’s door. “I think she might be.” 

Marjorie raised her eyebrows. “Don’t you think it’s getting late?”

Harold didn’t need to pursue the matter further. He knew where the conversation was headed so he reluctantly pulled his hand out from under her hem and slid off the couch letting her legs drop back onto it. The wood floor quietly creaked under his weight as he walked across the living room, past the kitchen and down the hall. 

Pausing for a moment just outside Shannon’s door, he listened for any noise. Hearing nothing, he looked up the hallway and whispered to Marjorie. “She must be asleep,” he said and then pushed the hollow core door slowly open. Harold stepped into her room and glanced at the bed, which to his surprise, was empty. It was an old game, so he played along. He knew her favorite spot to hide was under the bed so he carefully kneeled down to look under it, but it too was empty. 

At that moment, Shannon screamed and leapt from behind the door and onto her father’s back. 

Startled, Harold jerked his head up and smashed it against the bottom of the bed frame. “Damn it anyway!” he said. 

“You couldn’t find me!” Shannon yelled. 

Rubbing the back of his head, he smiled at her. “Hi sweet pea. You got me!” Standing up, he flung her over his shoulder in one motion and hugged her. “Do you know what time it is young lady?” 

Giggling, Shannon threw her arm around her father’s neck. “Time for bed?”

“Good answer.” 

Harold pulled back the covers he had previously tried to straighten and like a giant crane dropping its cargo he let her fall into the soft bedding. He quickly grabbed the pale yellow blanket that Marjorie had sewn and placed it over her then leaned down and kissed her. “Good night,” he said again then left the door ajar. His parents had always done it for him and so it felt natural.

































**CHAPTER 3**



Marjorie’s first experience with pregnancy was very similar to this one, although it unfortunately ended in miscarriage. Her sixty year old family practice doctor wisely suggested to Harold that childbirth may no longer be an option for her. 

“Some women are made better for bearing children,” he had said. 

This seemed somewhat true in their case because of Marjorie’s history with carrying her children to term. After the loss of their first child they fell into a depression that seemed to dull everything in life. 

As time marched on, hope began to return when they decided to go against the doctor’s advice and try again. Everything about the pregnancy seemed right. In fact it could have been deemed a perfect pregnancy until it wasn’t. On the day of the delivery, little Shannon emerged healthy, but Marjorie was taken into surgery almost immediately due to excessive hemorrhaging. She remained in the hospital for two weeks. 

“What are you thinking about?” Harold asked as he walked back over to his wife and reclaimed his spot on the couch. He pulled her legs onto his lap and leaned over her so that he could caress her belly.  

Marjorie let out a sigh and tears filled her eyes again. “Just thinking about Shannon’s delivery.” 

“Are you OK?” he asked. “You in good hands with the doctors. You’ll be OK, honey.” 

“I know, but there’s still an unknown to it all,” she said. 

“Should I call Eleanor and let her know that we might be bringing Shannon over tonight?” Giving Marjorie’s belly a light pat, he continued, “I don’t think this one is going to wait much longer.” 

“No,” Marjorie said with a cringe. “It’s not time yet. I’m just having some of the pains that get my body ready to go, that’s all.” She moved her legs to the ground and leaned against the corner of the couch. 

Harold stood and reached out to help Marjorie from the couch. “Listen,” he began, “you need your sleep.” He reached down and cradled her in his arms then gently lifted her from the couch and carried her to bed. “Now please go to sleep. You’re going to need your energy.”  

Marjorie slid under the covers of the modest double sized bed.  She arched her neck and kissed Harold as he adjusted her pillow. “I love you, Harry.” 

“I love you too.” Harold kissed her forehead and walked back toward the living room. He passed Shannon’s door and peered through the crack into the dark room. Little Shannon was asleep, curled into a small ball under her blankets. 

Harold headed to the kitchen. He glanced around the countertops and table to see if everything had been cleaned and straightened then walked at a slower pace into the living room where he sat down on the couch and sighed. Glancing at a few pictures hanging on the walls, he reflected on how photographs were a way to stop time, at least for that person with the younger smile and smoother complexion that always smiled back whether or not the same emotive gesture was reciprocated. 

The small side lamp on the table next to the couch shook slightly as he stood and walked over to the liquor cabinet that was leaning against the sidewall where he retrieved a bottle of cheap scotch. He pulled the cork stopper, poured himself half of a glass, then returned the bottle to the cabinet. 

Most of what Harold drank was cheap booze. It was nice to have a glass of something old and expensive every now and then, but he couldn’t seem to justify the cost. If he was honest with himself, it was difficult to really distinguish the finer notes that made a scotch better or more unique than its peers. He sipped at it at first. As usual, the scotch was smooth in his mouth and bit as it went down. The liquor warmed him slightly and the warmth brought back memories of the war. Harold sighed as he finished the glass then headed to bed. 

Marjorie stirred slightly as Harold crawled into their small bed. He rolled next to her sliding an arm over her belly and kissed her neck softly. Pulling her body tightly against his, he kissed her again. 

With a sigh, Marjorie said, “I love you honey, but leave me alone.” She eased his arm off of her body and readjusted in the bed. “We need to go to sleep,” she insisted. Her body was sore and exhausted and she knew that if she could only fall asleep her mind could slip away from the discomfort that was so persistent.  

Feeling a little put off, Harold rolled over and stared through the shades of the open window. He closed his eyes for a moment and then opened them again. It was now morning, but he felt like no time had passed at all. Not wanting to wake Marjorie, he stood slowly from the bed and pulled his clothes on. Harold walked into the kitchen where he began fumbling with a coffee cup for a moment.  

The sun was out and Harold could feel its heat through the small window above the kitchen sink. He set a pan on the stovetop and walked over to get a glass of water for the soft boiled eggs he wanted to make. Turning off the tap with his thumb, he glanced outside and saw a man leaning against a car he didn’t recognize, but somehow he knew it was his. Harold tilted his head in concentration as he focused on the man’s oddly familiar face. He waived at the man, but there was no response. Finding it increasingly odd, Harold headed outside. 

With his first step on the gravel driveway, his yard instantly changed and Harold spun around violently in shock. Instead of his house, he saw a large gray and tan apartment complex that was just part of the wall of dark concrete and cement that made up the wet city street he was on. 

“We’ve got them cornered sir.” First Sergeant Bendito Pernelli stood with his .30 caliber M1 Garand pointed at another apartment just feet from the jeep they were behind.  “Sir?” Pernelli stared at Harold with a sort of stunned expression. “Are you OK, sir?”  

“Yeah.” Harold shook his head and knelt next to the jeep. His mind was spinning.  His thoughts began to blur and suddenly he remembered what he was doing. *Bayeux, France.* The city street and the damp musty smell that clung heavily in the air seemed all too real. *What’s happening?* He questioned his sanity while trying to piece together how he managed to forget how he got there. Glancing at Sergeant Pernelli, he reached out and touched Pernelli’s jacket. “This is real,” he said aloud. 

“Wish it wasn’t,” came the clipped reply. Sergeant Pernelli gave Harold a side eye. “You sure you’re OK?” He lightly slapped a hand on the lieutenant’s helmet. “You’re looking pale.” 

“Yeah, I’m fine. A little light headed and dizzy that’s all.” Harold paused for a minute to take in his surroundings. A wall of gray, dirty buildings surrounded him. Rain pelted his jacket and helmet as he twisted his body to view the city street. “What’s going on?” Harold asked Pernelli. 

Pernelli smiled again. “Did you get hit on the head or something?” He watched him again for a minute longer and then turned back toward the action. “Alright,” he said. “We’ve got four Germans inside that building.” He pointed to the larger building just feet from the jeep. “I’ve sent five men in.” Pernelli peered around the jeep and continued, “there was some gunfire, but no word so far. So I figure you and I ought to go in and check on them.”  

Harold felt his stomach lurch as he looked at the building with anticipation. The sensation wasn’t a sense of fear, but more of a response to the uncertainty of the moment. “Let’s go.” He jacked the action back on his M1A1 Thompson submachine gun and moved quickly to the open door of the building. Harold moved quickly only glancing to see that Sergeant Pernelli was following with his rifle out in front.  

The inside of the building had the distinct stench of mildew that permeated the air and Harold could taste it with each breath. He led Pernelli through the entrance hall and into a longer hallway that was quiet. Raising his gun, he quickly pushed open a door to his right and scanned the interior of the room. Nothing. He glanced back at Pernelli who signaled that he would move up the main staircase. Harold watched the Italian born New Yorker begin his ascent. He then turned back to the doors lining the first floor hall and moved along the wall. The floor above groaned under Pernelli’s weight and Harold shrunk against the plastered wall. Giving it a moment, he then moved to the next door that was closed and in one motion, kicked it open. He scanned the room with his gun up, but the room was empty. 

The door across the hall suddenly creaked behind him and Harold spun defensively on his heel. There was nothing there, but that brought little relief to his racing heart. Taking a moment to listen, he hear Pernelli continue down the hallway above him and so Harold moved to the next door. It was ajar and he pressed on it with the barrel of his gun then walked through it slowly. This room was empty as well. 

A simple metal bed frame stood perpendicular to the wall in front of him. He scanned the room again and noticed a medium sized wooden dresser opposite the bed that was riddled with bullets. He smiled slightly as he considered the broken down dresser, of all things, could reflect the nature of war in such a beautiful yet terrible manner.  

Lowering his weapon, he sighed and glanced at the white, worn, and cracked plaster ceiling. Harold followed one of the larger cracks that ran over his head. He turned to walk out of the room and was met with the barrel of a German Gewehr 41. Jumping back in surprise, he recoiled as the German soldier raised the weapon to fire. Harold knew that the 7.92mm round would be fatal if it hit him. 

In the time it took for Harold to register the mortal danger he was in, the German pulled the trigger. Nothing happened. *Misfire,* he thought with sudden relief that turned to rage. “You son of a Bitch!” He yelled and ducked as the soldier swung the butt of his rifle at him, but it caught the top of his helmet. 

Harold tried to pull his submachine gun up, but his enemy drove his body into him knocking him off balance. He dropped his weapon and fell to the ground. He flailed his arms while grappling with the German. As he struggled, he knew that this was not just some neighborhood brawl that would end in a bloody nose and hurt feelings. One person would walk away from that room and Harold knew it had to be him. 

The German soldier grabbed Harold by the neck with both hands and began to squeeze violently. “Scheiskopf!” he yelled in his native tongue while foaming at the mouth. 

A jolt of pain that felt like a dagger pulsed through Harold’s neck as his enemy’s grip tightened. He dropped his left hand to the ground and managed to grab the wood stock of his weapon. With all the force he could muster, Harold swung the weapon up and into the German soldiers head.  

Air surged through his now open airway and he hungrily filled his lungs. Rolling over, he pulled the gun toward him but his enemy quickly kicked it away. Harold managed to get to his feet and drove his foot into the soldier’s ribs.  He leveled his foot and slammed it against the soldiers face and blood spurted from the German’s mouth. Harold watched the soldier roll onto his hands and knees and try to crawl toward the Thompson machine gun. 

Harold fell on him and put into practice the grappling skills he had learned in training. Sliding one arm under the soldier’s chin he pulled him against his chest and began to tighten his grip as he locked in the deadly choke hold. His enemy began to gasp for air in the same panic Harold had experienced. He squeezed harder and he could feel the life slipping away from his enemy. 

Suddenly, the door next to him flew open and Harold jerked his head up but no one was in sight. He didn’t want to lose this opportunity so he continued to squeeze harder. 

“Daddy?”  

A small voice from the door instantly drew his attention away from his enemy. “What?” he stammered in confusion. 

“Daddy!” The little voice became a fear-filled scream. “What are you doing to mommy?” 

The room surrounding Harold spun violently and everything became dark. He looked toward the doorway again and there stood his little Shannon.  

Shannon had tears in her eyes. “Daddy!” she screamed again. “What are you doing to mommy!” Her tiny voice shook as she ran to her mother’s aid.

Harold looked into his arms and saw his wife’s beautiful hair covering them. “Oh my God!” he gasp. “What the hell have I done?” He instantly released Marjorie from his tight death grip and he rested her on the pillows. 

Marjorie’s limp form lay helpless on the pillows and then she took a giant gasp of air. Her eyes opened wide in fear as she sucked as much air into her lungs as she could. Tears were rolling down her cheeks as her face began to regain its color. “Harry?” she said. “Are you OK?” Her voice was nothing more than a croak from having been crushed. 

Harold broke down in tears realizing what he’d done. “Oh my God, I’m sorry. I’m so sorry honey.” he moaned. “I didn’t know what I was doing!” He wiped his face and began to cradle Marjorie in the same arms that had almost killed her. “I love you so much and I’m so sorry. Are you OK?” Harold kissed Marjorie’s head and rocked her slowly.  

Shannon climbed on the bed and sat next to her father who squeezed her as well.  “Are you OK daddy?” she asked. 

Harold kissed them both. “No,” he said. He then set Shannon next to Marjorie and slid off his side of the bed. “Hold mommy. OK sweetie?” Walking swiftly into the kitchen, Harold ripped the water pot from the stovetop filled it then replaced it on the now reddening heat element. 

The sink was still running and Harold threw his hands under the clear hissing water.  He splashed a handful across his face then rested his arms on the sides of the sink.  “Fuck me,” he slurred. Harold continued to curse under his breath at the continued personal fallout from the war. He knew it had eviscerated what little empathy he had and now it’s tentacles stretched into his family’s lives threatening to destroy them as well. 

Within minutes, the hot water pot on the stove began to whistle and Harold quickly made a cup of tea for Marjorie. He carried it back to the bedroom where she continued to lay with Shannon at her side. 

Marjorie looked up at Harold exposing a red mark on the right side of her neck.  “Shannon fell back to sleep,” she said with a smile. A few tears still glistened in her eyes.  

“Here, drink this.” Harold handed Marjorie the tea and knelt beside her. “My God Margie, are you OK?” His voice began to tremble as he thought about the consequences of what might have happened had Shannon not brought him out of his nightmare.

1qk0kd5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIPulseDaily/comments/1qk0kd5/62000_likes_four_full_weeks_and_i_think_we_just/,"62,000 Likes. Four Full Weeks. And I Think We Just Watched AI Become Normal | Jan 22 Month Reflection","Hey everyone,

It’s Wednesday evening, exactly four weeks since that medical AI story started, and it just crossed \*\*62,000 likes\*\*.

I need to say something I’ve been avoiding for the last week:

\*\*I think it’s over.\*\*

Not the story—that’s clearly still going. But the moment when this was surprising, novel, noteworthy? I think that ended sometime around day 25.

And the fact that it ended might be the most important thing that happened.

\-----

\## What 62K Over 28 Days Actually Means

Four weeks ago, “I used AI to double-check my doctor” was a news story worth 62,000 engagements.

Today, three of my non-tech friends casually mentioned checking symptoms with AI like it’s completely normal.

\*\*That transition—from newsworthy to mundane—happened in four weeks.\*\*

I don’t think we appreciate how insanely fast that is.

For comparison:

\- Smartphones took years to feel normal

\- Social media took years to feel normal

\- “Googling it” took years to feel normal

“Checking with AI” went from novel to normalized in \*\*one month.\*\*

\-----

\## The Moment I Realized It Was Over

Last Friday, I was getting coffee and overheard two people (definitely not tech workers) talking about health stuff. One said:

“Yeah I asked ChatGPT about it first, then went to the doctor.”

Said it the same way you’d say “yeah I Googled it first.”

No explanation. No justification. No “isn’t technology amazing.” Just… a normal thing people do now.

\*\*That’s when I knew the story was over.\*\* Not because people stopped caring, but because they stopped being surprised.

\-----

\## What Actually Happened In Four Weeks

Let me try to map the timeline:

\*\*Week 1 (Days 1-7): Awareness\*\*

\- Tech community discovers story

\- “Wow AI can do that” reactions

\- Early mainstream media pickup

\- Engagement: 10K → 20K

\*\*Week 2 (Days 8-14): Amplification\*\*

\- Major news outlets cover it

\- Non-tech demographics engage

\- Professional bodies start responding

\- Engagement: 20K → 35K

\*\*Week 3 (Days 15-21): Integration\*\*

\- Story moves from news to conversation topic

\- People start trying AI verification themselves

\- “I did this too” stories emerge

\- Engagement: 35K → 50K

\*\*Week 4 (Days 22-28): Normalization\*\*

\- Story still growing but conversation shifts

\- “Of course people do this” replaces “wow people are doing this”

\- Behavior becomes unremarkable

\- Engagement: 50K → 62K

\*\*That progression—from novelty to normal in 28 days—is the story.\*\*

\-----

\## The Numbers That Tell The Real Story

Look at what else happened over four weeks:

\*\*DeepSeek transparency (16.7K):\*\*

From “interesting experiment” to “industry standard” in one month. Nine major labs now committed to publishing failures.

\*\*Agent guide (11.2K):\*\*

From “useful resource” to “required reading” in one month. Now cited in 500+ papers and adopted by 30+ universities.

\*\*Tesla integration (7.2K):\*\*

From “neat feature” to “expected functionality” in one month. Other automakers now announcing similar plans.

\*\*Gemini adoption (5.6K):\*\*

Google’s distribution advantage fully realized. Most people using AI now using it through Google products without thinking about it.

\*\*The pattern:\*\* Normalization happened across the board, not just the medical story.

\-----

\## What I Got Wrong (A Lot, Apparently)

Four weeks ago I thought we’d spend months debating whether people should use AI for medical verification.

Instead, people just… started doing it. No debate. No permission. Just behavior change.

\*\*I kept thinking:\*\* “When will society decide if this is okay?”

\*\*Reality:\*\* Society decided by doing it. The debate is over. The behavior is normal.

\*\*I kept asking:\*\* “What happens when AI becomes infrastructure?”

\*\*Reality:\*\* It already is. For millions of people, AI verification is as normal as Google search. It happened while I was analyzing whether it would happen.

\*\*I kept wondering:\*\* “Will institutions adapt or resist?”

\*\*Reality:\*\* They’re adapting because they have no choice. When enough patients show up with AI-generated questions, you either adapt or get left behind.

\*\*Turns out:\*\* Cultural adoption moves way faster than framework development. Behavior precedes norms. Actions precede understanding.

\-----

\## The Thing That’s Both Amazing and Terrifying

Four weeks ago, using AI to question medical advice was newsworthy.

Today, my barista does it without thinking about it.

\*\*That’s incredible.\*\* Technology that genuinely helps people became accessible and normalized in one month.

\*\*That’s also scary.\*\* We normalized major social change before developing appropriate frameworks, regulations, or shared understanding of implications.

Both true. Both important. Don’t know how to resolve the tension.

\-----

\## What The Last Week Taught Me

I’ve been tracking this daily for four weeks. Days 22-28 were different:

\*\*The conversation shifted from:\*\*

\- “Can AI do this?” → “Of course AI can do this”

\- “Should people do this?” → “People are doing this”

\- “What will happen?” → “This is happening”

\*\*The questions changed from:\*\*

\- “Is this possible?” → “How do we do this well?”

\- “Will people adopt this?” → “How do we make adoption equitable?”

\- “Should we allow this?” → “How do we regulate this responsibly?”

\*\*That shift from hypothetical to operational happened in the last six days.\*\*

\-----

\## What I Think Actually Happened Here

I don’t think we watched “AI get adopted.”

I think we watched \*\*trust redistribute\*\* in real time.

From exclusive trust in institutions → to distributed trust across institutions + AI verification

That’s not small. That’s potentially one of the bigger social shifts in recent memory.

And it happened in four weeks.

\*\*Because:\*\* One story gave people permission. Permission to question. Permission to verify. Permission to advocate for themselves.

And once people had permission, they didn’t wait for frameworks or regulations or societal consensus. They just… did it.

\-----

\## The Uncomfortable Questions I’m Sitting With

\*\*Are we better off?\*\*

People have tools to advocate for themselves. That’s good.

But are we just making broken systems more tolerable rather than fixing them? That’s… less good.

\*\*Is this equitable?\*\*

Millions now use AI verification. But is access distributed fairly? Do rich people get better AI advocates than poor people? Probably?

\*\*What did we lose?\*\*

Trust in expertise isn’t binary. When you add verification layers, you change relationships. Doctor-patient. Lawyer-client. Teacher-student. Are those changes net positive?

\*\*What happens next?\*\*

If AI verification became normal in one month, what else becomes normal in the next month? The next six? Where’s the equilibrium?

\*\*Are we ready?\*\*

Technology moved faster than regulation, norms, frameworks, understanding. Is that okay? Is it sustainable? What breaks first?

\*\*Don’t have answers. Just sitting with the discomfort.\*\*

\-----

\## What I’m Watching Now

The story is over in the sense that it’s normal now. But the implications are just beginning:

\*\*Regulatory response\*\* (FDA guidance expected within weeks)

\*\*Professional adaptation\*\* (medical associations issuing guidelines)

\*\*Equity concerns\*\* (who benefits, who gets left behind)

\*\*Next domains\*\* (legal, educational, financial verification becoming normal)

\*\*Corporate control\*\* (who owns the verification infrastructure)

\*\*Long-term effects\*\* (what happens when this is just how society works)

\-----

\## For This Community After Four Weeks

Thank you for being part of this.

I started these updates to track interesting AI news. They became something different—a group of people trying to make sense of rapid change together.

\*\*That shared sense-making might be the most valuable thing we’ve built.\*\*

Not predictions (mostly wrong). Not analysis (often incomplete). But honest attempts to understand what’s happening in real time, together, with appropriate humility about how much we don’t know.

That matters. Especially when change happens this fast.

\-----

\## What Comes Next For These Updates

I’ll keep tracking. But the nature of what I’m tracking is changing.

From: “Will this become normal?”

To: “Now that it’s normal, what are the implications?”

Different questions. Different analysis. Still trying to make sense of it together.

\-----

\## The Last Thing (Promise)

\*\*62,000 likes over 28 days.\*\*

But the number doesn’t matter anymore. What matters is that using AI for verification went from surprising to unremarkable in one month.

That’s the fastest normalization of major social behavior change I’ve ever witnessed.

And I’m still processing what it means.

\-----

🎯 \*\*if you also can’t believe it’s been four weeks\*\*

📊 \*\*if you’re still processing what just happened\*\*

🤝 \*\*if you’re glad we’re figuring this out together\*\*

\-----

\*Four weeks covering one story. Watched it go from news to normal. Still don’t know if that’s good or bad or just… what happens now.\*

\*Thanks for being here.\*

1qk0ixo,https://www.reddit.com/r/truckee/comments/1qk0ixo/the_truckee_food_scene/,The Truckee food scene,"It makes sense that the Truckee food/restaurant scene is over-indexed to tourists. Live in a tourist town, die by the tourist crowds. But as someone who lives here full-time, I'm tired of beer adjacent food (anything that goes with fried food, burgers, pizza, etc). It's what vacationers will gravitate to, but it's not great for eating out more often as a local.

The local baked goods & coffee scene is awesome. We have enough brunch places, but they're hard to get into on the weekends. And while the $$$$ restaurants in the area are pretty decent, the $$ restaurants aren't great. Even the ones I like are consistently inconsistent and I'm generally stuck ordering the same dish at each of those places. Menus tend to be pretty limited, service is rocky, hours can be pretty weird (I have a Yelp list just for those places that close at 3pm during the week and which I may.. someday.. visit on a Saturday).

But I don't want to just make a thread to complain. I've seen the turn-over in restaurants and the low score trends on Yelp, and I'd rather ask other locals to share wish-lists and recommendations to those people are who thinking of opening a new restaurant in the area. What would improve their odds but also make the Truckee food scene better? How to sell to the tourists & part-timers while also fostering a stronger local following beyond the bar scene? How could we support healthier food options too?

Please don't call-out any restaurants by name. Let's not do that. Better to crowd source a little market intelligence for those restaurateurs thinking of sinking their $ into a new Truckee area restaurant. I dream of better eating in the area.

working on Day 5 of no nicotine after popping Rogue pouches for the past year and a half. mostly 6mg half a can a day habit. 

  
first couple of days have been easy and hard in some ways. I quit drinking two years ago so I know the drill of getting through the withdrawal period but even having that experience to draw from, it’s still been tough to stay strong. 

  
right now my emotions are just raw. I wish I was in a situation where I could take the week off work, exercise a ton, cook a bunch of meals and struggle through it but my life isn’t at a place where I can afford that. 

currently white knuckling it at work and just getting bad news over and over all week which is sending me spiraling. its hard to stay positive when all of my hard work keeps getting tossed in the trash by managers who don’t care about how much work I do for them. 

  
what has helped has been drinking coffee, popping replacement pouches (shout out to Grind and Wild brand) and just trying to focus on work.

I'm struggling with the diet and yesterday I almost didn't do a weights workout.

  
The weather was bleh (raining, cold, dark). My mood was pretty lousy. I forced myself to go for a walk, which helped.

  
But more importantly over a cup of coffee, I actively worked on shifting my mood and mindset. I looked at some images and videos of people working out. I thought about how much I disliked the feelings that were pushing me in to not doing what I should be doing.

I reminded myself it always feels good when you push back and against those feelings. That action crushes anxiety, that motion creates emotion, and that I can change the way I feel.

I also lowered the bar a bit. I knew I would go over my calorie target for the day, and decided I'd make some nice, healthy food (a baked apple dessert, potato wedges using olive oil - I normally skip the oil, and some avocado). 

I did my workout, I ate more calories than I should have, I felt good, and now I am fasting. The fast is more of a struggle than normal, partly why I am brain dumping this post to hopefully help me power through.

  
I guess the TLDRs are:

\- if you are feeling apathetic/unmotivated try and focus on changing your internal state/feelings to get some kind of motivation to do something as opposed to nothing

\- it always feels good to push back against feelings and thoughts that are going to go against your goals.

1qk0d3f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1qk0d3f/should_i_report_my_coworker/,Should I report my coworker,"LONG POST ‼️⚠️

So I (19F) currently work at a hospital as a dietary technician. I’ve been here for about 10 months and I like the job and my coworkers for the most part. The other day, I mentioned to my boss around 4p that I was stopping to Starbucks the next day on the way to work and asked that she send her order. My boss sent it as well as my supervisor and another coworker of mine. So the next day comes, Tuesday, and I picked up the Starbucks order and head to work. It’s around 5:55a and my shift starts at 6. I get to work without a problem and left the Starbucks order sitting on the counter while I went to give my supervisor her coffee. As I’m walking back to the coffees, my coworker says, “oh who bought coffee for everyone? Must’ve been you” and I just smiled and nodded my head. Now normally, I would offer to get her something if I stopped but that day she completely slipped my mind and I wasn’t necessarily thinking about her. So she goes into the office and closes the door and then comes out maybe 20 minutes later while I was building trays and says something along the lines of “you bought everyone coffee but me. it’s fuck me huh?” And then laughed. So because I thought we were joking I said “no you just slipped my mind so I didn’t get you anything. I’ll get you something next time” and i left it at that. The next day comes, (Wednesday) and it’s around 6:30a when my coworker walks in and goes into the office. So because I have to go in there as well I speak like how I normally do (keep in mind before this we were pretty close) so I said good morning and in response she just said “hello” in a monotone that wasn’t like her normal self so I already knew something was off. Nonetheless, I left it alone until my older coworker joked and said to her that I still haven’t bought her chick fil a to which said coworker, I’ll call her Elle, then said “yeah I’m mad at (my name) right now. She wanna be a stank ass bitch and buy everyone else coffee” so I also brushed that off because again, we were once cool so I’m thinking she’s still playing. However today comes and she has a different attitude. This morning when I went to grab a piece of gum out of the chef’s office she was standing in the doorway with a little room to squeeze by so I said “oh my bad excuse me” and then went around her to grab the gum. Her response was “damn, excuse you!” To which I responded by saying that I said excuse me, you chose not to hear me. I walked off and let that be that while still hearing her say “bitches are so rude” and something about “stank ass hoes”. Okay cool. So I’m still not paying her any mind because mind you, she’s 33 years old I believe. If you’re this upset over a $6 coffee I’m not sure what to tell you. A situation happened with a patient at our hospital that involved her and another coworker so I was talking to my coworker about just to see what happened because the tech came to me about it. As my coworker is telling me what happened “Elle” came up and said “I’m just trynna figure out why the fuck it’s still being brought up.” In an aggressive tone like she wanted me to “clap back” at her. So I said to my coworker that it was brought to me and so I wanted to talk to her about it. Mind you, “Elle” isn’t my supervisor so at the end of the day I don’t have to take any orders from her. After that, she stormed off to our director and I guess she asked her had the tray been delivered so she came back out and asked “aye did yall take the tray to the patient?” So because I was already ticked off and annoyed with her and she was also sending my blood pressure sky high from the hostility of the whole day, I ignored her and continued to walk to the door. I took the tray but I know that she also seen me make it so that shouldn’t have even been a question to come and ask me. The head chef then replied with “ask ‘my name’ I know I seen her working on it” to which she replies with “I know she heard me I said it out loud.” I finally responded by saying yes I took it and after she went to go relay the message to our director she came back over walking towards the office saying “stank ass bitch I know that bitch heard me” and continuously just going off. After that I went upstairs to do my rounds on patients but I wanted to know is this worth going to HR? I can’t exactly go to my manager because my manager and “Elle” are besties and my director simply wouldn’t do anything about it. Neither would the head chef. Going through this with her does make me feel uncomfortable, I do suffer from anxiety and so being put in stressful situations like this at work has triggered my chest to start contracting really bad as well as getting shortness of breath sometimes due to my heart racing so fast. I don’t want to respond to this or argue with her because again, we were once really good friends, but I can’t allow something like this to put not only my health at risk but also my mental health as I am now afraid that she might try to fight me at work.

Started with a Baratza Encore and enjoyed my espresso (yes it *can* make espresso) but wanted to see what all the fuss was about with better equipment

Landed on the **Varia** **VS6** as I had no experience with other grinders and this is the only option allowing cones and flats and no worries about alignment on burr change

Started with the stock flat burrs and was blown away at the extra richness of flavor. I enjoy medium to dark roasts and strong aftertaste and boy did this deliver. The same coffees I had been drinking for months felt much more alive with more interesting texture, particularly the decaf from [Little Wolf](https://littlewolf.coffee/) (amazing roaster!)

After a few months I switched to the regular cone burr for the VS6. I change coffees a ton so maybe this would be easier to dial in? What I got were cups that were still good but missing that depth I had grown accustomed to and the “god shots” became spaced further apart. Everything seemed more muddled?

Laziness got the better of me so I stuck with that for many months until the nagging feeling came back to go back to flats

Made the change back to flats a few weeks ago and was immediately reminded of the depth in flavor I had experienced

Take this for what you will but as the machine is the same I figure this is pretty much as close you can get to compare flats vs burrs and I am a fan of flats even for dark roast!",1,1769101863.0,espresso,3,0.67,False

At the same time, I know myself well enough to know that if I do not try, this will turn into one of those regrets I carry around for years. I am not expecting anything huge or romantic. I would be happy just asking her to grab coffee and seeing how it goes.

What I am looking for is grounded advice from a body language and vibe perspective. How do you approach something like this calmly when your anxiety is already high before you even speak. What signs should I watch for in the moment that tell me to continue or to back off respectfully. I want to handle this like an adult, be clear and respectful, accept whatever answer I get, and still be able to walk past her in the hallway without feeling ashamed or wanting to disappear.",0,1769101216.0,Advice,0,0.5,False

I arrived last weekend and work’s been nonstop, so I’m now trying to actually do something with my weekends and meet people.

I don’t know anyone in Riyadh yet and would love to plug into sports groups, especially padel, tennis, or futsal. Skill-wise: I’m pretty decent at padel, average at tennis, and in futsal I’m a pretty solid keeper.

A bit about me: I’m originally from Pakistan, studied in the UK for \~4 years (undergrad + postgrad), worked there for a bit and now work as a strategy consultant across the GCC. Easy-going and mainly looking for active ways to meet people, games, group sessions, or even just a coffee.

If you have recommendations for where to find regular pick-up games / leagues / WhatsApp groups / clubs, or if anyone’s looking for an extra player this weekend, I’d really appreciate it.",2,1769101170.0,RiyadhExpats,0,1.0,False
1qjzz3i,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1qjzz3i/boss_offering_to_sell_me_the_coffee_shop_i_work/,Boss offering to sell me the coffee shop I work at for $65k — does this sound reasonable on the surface?,"So I’ve worked at a small waffle and coffee shop for about 3 years. It’s a small operation in downtown of a large city. The owner recently offered to sell me the business for $65,000. His reasoning is that he wants to free up capital to put into another business he’s scaling, and he feels comfortable passing this one on to me since I already run much of the day-to-day. They’re hardly there in person at this point, maybe once a month or every other month to collect the cash. We’re located in a small food hall under an office building, so there’s a constant supply of costumers from there. Not enough to keep our numbers where we want, but it helps make sure we’re never actually dead I think. We’re also located right by the theatre district so whenever there’s ballet shows or operas it guarantees some traffic. The rent is also taken by the food hall as a percentage of our sales so whenever it’s slow we don’t get hurt too badly. Another factor maybe worth considering is that we partnered with Starbucks, so we buy their products and can sell them, something he already paid the license for.

Some numbers:

	•	Monthly sales usually fall between $5k–$7k per week. Highs of 8k+  

	•	Average month is around $30-35k. Busy months can get close to $40k, slowest (usually just January) is around 25

	•	He claims the business nets about $3k–$4k in profit per month

What I’m trying to figure out:

	•	On the surface, does a $65k asking price sound reasonable given those numbers?

	•	What specific documents should I ask to see before even considering this seriously?

	•	What questions should I be asking about expenses, lease terms, debt, equipment, etc.?

	•	What are common things first-time buyers overlook in situations like this?

I’m not rushing into anything — just trying to educate myself before I say yes or no. I appreciate any insight from people who’ve bought or sold small businesses before.

Or so i think.,"Heyy everyone, after watching CreepCast for a long time now, i decided to write something on my own. This is the first thing i´ve ever written, so criticism will be highly appreciated! English is not my first language, so sorry about any mistakes and hopefully, you will enjoy :))



i've tried psychologists, therapists, psychiatrists. i've even admitted myself to a mental hospital. and after all these years, it returned. for a while though, i thought it was gone. but today morning i woke up, full of dread and i lost all my hope. an unstoppable force is coming for me, with there being no potential way to avoid my fate. and what i fear the most is, that i will live through it and after it, for eternity. they will find me in my bed, my corpse excreting an odor so foul they will have to wear gas masks, which will not help. i will be nothing but a body rotten to the point of not being able to be identified, but they will know it's me. i´m leaving a letter on my bedside table, cluttered with sleep pills and antipsychotic medication, which i have not touched in over 2 years. i like to keep them next to me to remind me of the tale i thought i will never ever have to live in again. what a fool am i. pieces of bones sticking out of the decaying mass vaguely resembling the shape of a 2d person, too frail to touch without breaking. piles of liquified body tissue dripping down the sides of my bed and stacking up on top of itself as it will be too solid to just spill out into pools on the carpet. ribcage collapsed onto itself, its bones too weak to be left hanging in the air, now in the form of cluster of fragments looking like a heap of white sticks covered in guts on top of a part of my spine.



and they will be shocked, because just the day before they find me, i was in a room full of people, greeting and hugging them, smoking cigarettes, drinking. 



i know. i know. i know. i know it all. i know every second of it, just like a familiar gaze at the bus stop on my everyday way from work. i have seen it, the same scene over and over. the banging on the door, my friend retching and throwing up on the doorstep to my bedroom, the gaging policemen and the guys in hazmat suits. my lifeless body, anyways what was left of it. it is so engraved in my mind it feels almost automatic. it showed me so many times. 



about three years earlier, i had my first dream. well, at least i think it was the first one concerning... this. i was just in my room, standing, looking on my door. i tried to move, but every time i turned, the room rotated with me. like i physically could not look away from the door, so i assumed the only way was through it. with great difficulties i raised my leg in the air and then moved forward like you would if you took a regular step. but my foot was so heavy, like it was made of some metal or cement or whatever the fuck is the heaviest thing on the planet. and all of that  effort for nothing, it was like i was on a treadmill. the room just moved with me, but in a weird way, think of it like an old ps1 graphic that moved on the walls. so i figured the only thing i could do without causing me extreme nausea is stand still and stare at the door. nothing happened. in the dream it felt like i didn't change my position for eternity, or at least so long, i knew it was supposed to be day already. but the sun just didn't come up. it it seemed like a strange but normal dream with regular dream logic.

i am unsure of this, but i think it came back, the same dream, the same feeling, it soon all became a blur with what followed up. 



i experienced weirder dreams later that same month. all were taking place in my room and it was kinda horrifying how accurate of a replica it became over time. in the first dream i could only see the door and faint wallpaper around it. in the fifth dream, the resemblance was so perfect i had to acknowledge it in my notes i started taking about these sleep hallucinations. i mean, i realize it´s my room and it´s only logical i know it so well, yet my mind started depicting things i wasn't aware of. first, it was a sock under my bed. i was dreaming of me hearing rustling  somewhere in my room and i couldn't determine the source. it sounded like between a small animal in the bushes and something solid and small dragging across a hard, structured surface. i tried to ignore it, but it got on my nerves so bad, i got up from bed and started thrashing my room, opened a door, stepped outside, but then i could hear that it came from my room. so i came back inside and as i observed the room a lightbulb lit up above my head. i didn't look under my bed.  suddenly, i started to feel like a little kid that is afraid of the boogie man. the fear made me feel so small and powerless. all that irritation from before, when the sound prevented me from sleep was gone. all i had left was the uncertainty of my own strength. in the end the curiosity got the best of me and i looked, the scraping stopping abruptly and i startled at the sudden absence of any noise. almost too quiet, like my hearing didn't work, my world became soundproof. all i found under my bed was a sock i have been searching for a week by now. i recognized that sock  because it was the only colorful one in my closet. i only have em because it was a gift from papa. he knew i hated colorful ones and that´s why he got them. i still have them to this day to remember how he was. first i thought maybe it was because of his death i had something wrong with my head and that was the reason for these dreams. anyways, the moment i found out what the object was, satisfied with the light raucous being gone i hopped back under the covers and fell asleep. 

i woke up in the morning and to my surprise, the sock was right there, in the same position as it was showed me in my dream. what a convenient random dream right? 



by the 20th dream it began to predict future and it was getting more regular. by more regular i mean every day, with occasional pauses where there was nothing, just blank darkness instead of a dream. one time i was just on my chair behind the desk, staring at the wall. i looked around and for a change, it was bright day. but no cars outside, no people, no bird singing, no nothing. i opened a window to catch a drift on fresh air, and there was it, on the windowsill, a hairtie. a normal looking hairtie. what was not normal tho, was that my room i am sleeping in, is on the second floor. my first floor is just the kitchen, living room, bathroom and on the second floor is my bedroom. i don´t even own a hair tie. two days later, i came back from work, i even forgot about the dream, because it was so short and nonsensical. i come to my bedroom and as i am opening a window to air out the room i see it. a black hair tie, on the same exact spot. i instantly remembered the dream and i finally decided to do something, i was getting scared, i did not understand anything and it was clear to me, that this is not normal. i had some mental issues in the past and i knew how bad it can get if i spiral into my own thoughts and paranoia. that was the last thing i needed right now. it kind of surprised me, how much i´ve grown since my past. and for a moment, i calmed down, and i was pleased with how far i´ve come. so i called my GP and said i need a referral letter to a therapist.



i ended up going the next day and all i got was being sent to a psychiatrist to get prescription for some medication and a date for our next session. i just hoped for the medicine to work. i was a getting gradually more afraid to go to sleep, my mind jumped to the most horrifying pictures i could imagine. what if it showed me someone being dead? do i tell them? do i not? would they even believe my words? if someone just walked up to me and said i´m going to die and that they have prophetic dreams and they have seen it, i would probably send them to hell, not even a doctor. i quickly shifted my attention to putting the pills i got into a sorting box that has 7 names of days on it so i remember to take them every day. while there was still a chance for those dreams to occur, there was nothing i could do about it, so i thought, for my own sake of mind, i should keep it outside my train of thoughts while i could. before i laid down to sleep, i took 2 pills. first one being some kind of sedative to calm my mind and hopefully cause milder vividity of the dreams. second one was a antipsychotic drug, also to calm my imagination and brain. 



next morning, i awoken to sweat-soaked sheets and pjs, but i could not recall any dream. i still remember the good feeling i had, how filled with joy i was. this had gone on for like three days and then i got reminded, that human brain is so powerful, it can overcome any drug in the world if it adapts. came back to the psychiatrist asking for a higher dose, but they said it was too soon and i should give it some time. after the following night i went again and begged, telling them i was so scared and protesting to sleep if they don't prescribe me a stronger kind or allow me to take more. i could do it on my own, but if i ran out, they would not give me more until the estimated time was up, so the doctor had to up the dose himself and check in with the pharmacy. they ordered me to buy some kind of sleep medication so i didn't wake up during the night and changed the sedative brand and told me to bring back the unused ones i still had at home. it made it worse.



the sleeping pills made those dreams more life-like than life itself. i thought i teleported into another dimension and i´m never getting out of this place. it was so dark in my room, my eyes couldn't adjust, all i could see was dark silhouettes resembling my furniture. but then there was this light and as my door slowly creeked open i figured it was coming out of the hallway. as i reached for the doorknob a sense of impending doom fell onto me. i stopped my hand in the movement and retracted it. i knew something horrible was behind that door and even if i had to stay in this blackness my room became, i was NOT opening that door and i went to shut it close, i didn't want to see any bit of the light anymore. but as i pulled the doorknob, someone or something has put its foot right in between the door and the wall, so i couldn't close it and i jumped so hard, i pushed the door, it came flying open and the light blinded me. that was when i woke up. 



i looked it up and the web said some sleeping pills can cause your dreams to be more realistic and detailed. i decided to stop taking them. and there came another que that me and nothing i try to do to stop it  does not have any effect, the last phase. it developed over like two weeks, and each time it was more clear what i was seeing. on the 13th day it was obvious what i was seeing. i was crouched next to my bed, and i couldn't move, except look around with my eyes. it was kinda hard to see because of the dark, but on my bed there i was, laying down, sleeping peacefully. my door started opening up again and i caught a glance of that light again. i tried to get on my feet and go slam the door shut as fast as i could, but i was glued together in my position on the ground. so i watched, as it became bigger, and gradually filled the whole room. this time, i didn't wake up. 

everything was gone. only a white blinding space, my bed with me on top levitating just barely in my field vision. to see it, i had to rotate my eyes fully to the left, but gaze any longer than few seconds hurt so much i sticked to looking mostly forward and making out images using my periphery vision. nothing at all happened the first time i saw this dream. steadily, night after night, the time i spent in this scene increased, i recall trying to count it but the numbers did not make sense. time did not make sense. space did not make sense. movement did not make sense. nothing at all made sense. i wish i could put it in numbers you can understand, a time frame, measurements, except i had nothing. no clock, no hunger, no getting tired, no change in light, and that way you lose count pretty fast. at the end of it all, it felt like i was watching it for over a month at once. but still i snapped out of it in the morning, sometimes middle of the night. 



the view started to change one night. my sleeping body began to change in color, i was getting paler. over a next few nights, there were appearing yellow stains, then green, some sort of blue-violet, all bruise-like. i was getting less and less sleep, i had to take a sick leave of work, i was petrified what would happen next. one time i admitted myself to a mental institution, even though i believed i was not crazy, i was just desperate to get rid of this. they did not help me. they drugged me, sedated me and even the other patients did not want to keep close contact with me, well better said almost no contact. all i talked about in group therapy were my night terrors. nobody got me. nobody understood me. i can't blame them. i realize what is happening to me is rare, though it gets lonely sometimes. to know the other person is listening, but can not grasp the idea of it all in its raw form. if somebody tells you person close to them died, you could probably console them, and on some level relate to them. even if you had not lost anyone yet. experiences like mine are not like that. there is probably nobody that could recognize the true feeling of my fear, greater than the fear for my life. far, far greater. i fear what happened to my soul. and to think that on a lonely evening makes me want to end it all myself, before it gets me. 



the closest i got to having somebody understand me was a paranoid schizophrenic named Franz. He was a troubled young man with a past full of psychotic seizures, threatened to kill himself countless times. nobody took him serious anymore, they just saw him as a madman. we talked a lot, he was trying to convince me the world will end in like 2 years, he said his ancestors that watched form above told him. it might have sounded crazy, ""but who the hell knows at this point?"" i was telling myself. i was having prophetic dreams about ordinary things, he might be even a level higher than me. now, that the time has passed i know he was not telling the truth, but also he might have miscalculated. he was probably just sick in the head, ironic that he was the only one who was really nice to me and did not get annoyed while i was talking. he even validated my feelings and my visions like no one other. i wonder about him now, if he is still in the hospital or at home, preparing for Armageddon. or maybe he died. maybe his world did end. 



it evolved to the point i recognised a rotting process. i was dead on my bed and each time i fell asleep, the light came into my room and began to decompose my body, adding it layer by layer. after the bruises, it started to smell. it was so bad at first, imagine if you did not drink water for like a week and then pissed yourself and threw the clothes on the ground, and the thing that would fill the room and make you take a step back if you came inside, that was the first thing i got. then it became this bad breath-mouth never washed-food starved type shit. i´m sure you ever witnessed yours or someones breath when they haven´t ate all day. this was like triple the real life scenario. i had to start keeping strong essential oils next to my bed so the first thing i did in the morning was to take a deep breath of something that would erase the memory of anything i experienced it my nightmares. although i could not keep not thinking about it when i smelled anything sulfurous, egg-like, or anything that might come to mind if i say rotting flesh. you can look at the sources from all the forensic experts on how death smells like if you want, it´s all the same and they are 100% right. it´s not like it´s unimaginable, but it is hard to imagine. but once you smell it, you know it´s what you are looking for. 



always the same routine. i stopped taking any medication all together, it did not even matter. with or without, it was all the same. i think it was pure coincidence, that the intensity of the dreams synced up with me trying to stop it. my last resort was relocating my bedside table on the other side of my bed, where i was crouching. maybe if it did not make sense in the dream, because there would be no place for me, but it did not help. desperate situations call for desperate measures. i even tried to stay awake for as long as i could, but then i started having hallucinations, and started dosing off during the day, where the dreams did not stop, nor were they the same, but i would have weird visions, where i was in the position of the light and was walking through my bedroom door. there was simply no solution. 



over the next two months i reached peak of it all. for eternity, watching the flesh fall off of my bones. slowly sinking into the mattress, the height of my laying body getting smaller and smaller. various liquids flowing from the lifeless mass i became. stench getting worse and worse, at that point i could not get it out of my nose even when i was awake. i wanted to cut off my nose, pierce it with a long needle, do antyhing to stop me from processing taste and smell. 

i was actually glad i could not see my head, because it was physically impossible ot turn my eyes that way. watching my mouth open, body fluid rushing through there, jaw unhinge as there was nothing to hold it together, eyes sink into my sockets and probably stay right there in my skull opening and dissolving, face mutating, altering until it resembled something that was closer to a horror movie monster than a human being. 

all my life i thought that bones do not decay, that they stayed intact, but it turns out that is not true. anything that was above my bed, hanging in the air just started fracturing, too fragile to support the weight of itself and bit by bit, fell onto the rest of my remains accompanied by loud snaps and crackles. my ribcage and pelvis mainly, then also my feet. the occasional movement of the falling bones and further process of melting of flesh caused the organic matter to move, splashing onto the white space right next to my bed. i watched as it dried up, the consistency allowing another portion to fall right on top and dry up like the previous, just accumulating into a tall clump. 



one night, after all of this, my room started to become darker until all the light was gone. and it was day. i stared at the mess i've become, spreaded onto my bed and floor. i heard muffled banging on my door, my phone ringing. some time passed and there were voices outside my room, my door being opened. some people i did not know or recognise came into my room, one of them instantly throwing up, the other one making it to what i guess was bathroom or a kitchen sink and then throwing up. screaming, crying, calling the police. they arrived and could not believe their eyes. while observing the scene, they were talking about ""how is this possible"" and that ""they have never seen anything like this before"". they were looking at me, in my eyes, up close, shining their flashlight, yet they did not see i was alive. the guys in special suits specialized for work with decaying and organic matter came in twice, first time they had to change their masks for some else, because of the putrid stench. i didn't even smell it anymore. i did not see anything after that. 



i thought to myself, i can´t keep with this anymore, this is it. i wrote a letter, put it onto my nightstand. i spent the day with myself, got a coffee, took a long walk, got high off of dispenser weed, smoked like two packs of cigarettes in this day. but decided to give it one last try. i went to sleep and woke up the next morning... well rested? i dreamed of a tree i saw in the park the day before on my walk, and a deer that was stuck on top and i had to call the fire department to get it down. i did not believe it was the end. it tortured me for so long, even with pauses i did not want to believe. but the human nature of the instinct that keeps you living for as long as possible to preserve your kind had won. spent next months recovering from all the damage to my psyche, work, body and social contact. i got a new job, met amazing people and fit into the society again. did not have any dreams about the previous whatever was that, but i hade some repeating numbers in my dreams. any dream i had with any type of numbers in it it was always 12 or 26, sometimes both, but 26 never came before 12. i did make a note about it in my therapy session, but for my own sake i did not put any significance on that, i was traumatized enough.



tomorrow is dcember the 1st of 2026. and this night i had a strange dream. i was again in the spot of my bedside table. familiar scene, all that was left of my body, on my bed as the forensics in yellow bio-hazard suits were shuffling my furniture out of my room. they were struggling with a big mirror in that moment. when they reached a point right in front of me, all i saw in the reflection was my bedside table and on top of it, in a hoard of medication bottles, my fully intact head with my eyes opened.

I found a tea I absolutely love for mornings, Hot Cinnamon Spice by Harney & Sons, but I'm looking for something I can make in the evenings that doesn't have caffeine. 

My experience with herbal teas is a bit mixed. I tried a chamomile and found it to be completely bland (though that may have been user error, it was very early on and not sure I brewed it right), and another time I tried a raspberry hibiscus and found it overly sweet to the point it was like a syrup.

I recently got Harney & Sons Blood Orange herbal fruit tea, and while I'm not in love with it I don't dislike it either. I know not to expect the same boldness/strength as I get from my black tea, but the first brew was sort of like hot water with an orange aftertaste. I'll have to mess around with leaf amounts and steep time  more. (any tips on this would be greatly appreciated!)

So, what caffeine free teas would you all recommend? I've never tried a decaf tea but if its anything like decaf coffee I assume I wouldn't like the taste. Thanks!!",2,1769101053.0,tea,6,1.0,False

1qjzvur,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/comments/1qjzvur/claude_office_visualizer_realtime_pixel_art/,Claude Office Visualizer - Real-Time Pixel Art Visualization of Claude Code Operations,"I'm excited to share **Claude Office Visualizer**, a fun project that transforms Claude Code CLI operations into a real-time pixel art office simulation. Watch as Claude delegates work and manages a team of AI employees!

# Screenshots

https://preview.redd.it/w1qy6v4elxeg1.png?width=1933&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba4f4e98775330c8a134ae5b651f6a76cce16eea

# Demo Video

[Watch the demo](https://youtu.be/AM2UjKYB8Ew)

# What Is It?

Claude Office Visualizer hooks into the Claude Code CLI and visualizes everything that happens during a coding session:

* **The Boss**: Main Claude agent appears as a boss character who receives tasks and delegates work
* **Employees**: Subagents spawn as employee characters who walk through the office, sit at desks, and work on their assigned tasks
* **Real-time Activity**: Tool usage, file operations, and agent communications appear as thought/speech bubbles
* **Office Life**: Agents queue at the elevator, have conversations when handing in work, and leave when done

# Key Features

**Visual Elements:**

* Animated pixel art office environment
* Simple cartoon characters with multiple animation states (idle, walking, working, etc.)
* Day/night cycle in the city skyline window based on your local time
* Filling trashcan that shows context window utilization
* Compaction animation where the boss stomps on the trashcan

**Multi-Mode Whiteboard** \- Click to cycle through 10 display modes:

* Todo list (synced with Claude's TodoWrite)
* Tool usage pie chart
* Org chart showing agent hierarchy
* Timeline of agent lifespans
* News ticker with session events
* Coffee tracker
* File edit heat map
* Safety board (tool uses since last compaction)
* Weather display
* Stonks chart

**Other Features:**

* Git status panel showing repository state
* Printer that animates when Claude produces reports
* Random quotes when agents receive or turn in work
* WebSocket-based real-time updates

# Technical Stack

* **Frontend**: Next.js, PixiJS, TypeScript, Zustand, XState v5
* **Backend**: FastAPI, WebSocket, SQLite, Python 3.14+
* **Hooks**: Python-based Claude Code hooks that intercept events

# How It Works

1. Claude Code hooks intercept events (tool use, subagent spawn/stop, context compaction, etc.)
2. Events are sent via HTTP to the FastAPI backend
3. Backend maintains session state and broadcasts updates via WebSocket
4. Frontend receives updates and animates the office scene accordingly

# Installation

    # Clone and install
    git clone https://github.com/paulrobello/claude-office.git
    cd claude-office
    make install-all
    
    # Start the servers (recommended: uses tmux)
    make dev-tmux
    
    # Open http://localhost:3000 and run any Claude Code command

Works on **macOS**, **Linux**, and **Windows**. Docker deployment is also available.

# Why I Built This

I wanted a fun way to visualize what Claude Code is actually doing during long coding sessions. It's satisfying to watch the little pixel characters working away while Claude helps me code!

Volume II

41 - Starecross

John Segundus has become a magic tutor. He goes to check out a library at a house called Starecross Hall, which is for sale. He finds a young woman sitting in a parlour. The little finger on her left hand is missing. She’s replaced by an older woman. John faints in shock. When he comes round, Mrs Lennox, who owns the house and her companion Mrs Blake help him. He joins them for dinner. They offer to help him set up a school for magicians at Starecross Hall.

Mr and Mrs Honeyfoot are delighted with his plan. John and Mrs Lennox prepare Starecross Hall for the school. Jonathan Strange promises to visit the next spring.

John is convinced something will go wrong. Mr Norrell sends his servant Childermass to dissuade him from setting up the school and gets influential men to support him. John writes to Jonathan Strange but doesn’t receive a reply.

42 - Strange decides to write a book

Lascelles tells Mr Norrell that Jonathan Strange is writing a book called The History and Practice of English Magic. Mr Norrell is annoyed. He’s been writing a book called The Precepts for the Education of a Magician for some time. He tries to use his silver bowl to see what Jonathan Strange is doing but can’t because Strange has turned all the mirrors to the wall.

One evening, Stephen Black is transported from polishing silver to a coffee house. The gentleman with thistle-down hair is sitting at a table. He’s ordered a lavish meal ate there centuries ago with John Uskglass’ servants, human soldiers and fairies before going to fight in a war. He says Jonathan Strange is writing a book about fairies’ involvement in human history and encouraging magicians to summon them. He repeats that Stephen will be King of England but would spend most of his time at Lost-hope with the gentleman with thistle-down hair and Lady Pole.

He’s going off Lady Pole and is more interested in another lady who could stay with him forever. He wants Stephen to help him abduct her. This will help him become king. Stephen assumes he means one of the royal princesses.

The gentleman takes Stephen to a bog to collect some moss-oak he needs to capture the lady. Stephen gets stuck in the bog and the gentleman pulls him out. They wait for dawn. Stephen dreams and is woken by the gentleman singing. The whole world listens to the song. Stephen dreams again about communicating with natural objects and being able to alter their purpose.

When he wakes up the gentleman tells him they’re in Scotland. Stephen digs up a piece of moss-oak. Afterwards he’s exhausted. They’re transported back to the coffee house.

43 - The curious adventure of Mr Hyde

Jonathan Strange has a visit from his neighbour Mr Hyde. Mr Hyde tells him he was riding back from Wales in thick snow when he heard a bell tolling. He saw a lady in a black dress walking towards him. He thought something bad must have happened to her so he went after her but he couldn’t see her. The lady was Arabella Strange.

Jonathan doesn’t believe him. Neither does his servant Jeremy because Arabella was sitting in the Stranges’ house wearing a blue dress.

(Jonathan’s mother died after wandering in the same countryside in a rainstorm because of her unhappy marriage.)

Arabella is surprised when Jonathan tells her what Mr Hyde said. She intends to visit him when her brother Henry comes for Christmas. Arabella and Henry have less in common now as he lives in a small village, where he’s Rector of a church, and she’s used to the excitement and influential people of London. Henry dislikes the air of magic in the Stranges’ house. He irritates Jonathan. Priests and magicians have a history of conflicting views.

Arabella is ill on Christmas Day so Jonathan and Henry are left to play cards together. During the night, Jonathan wakes and sees a silvery radiance in his room and Arabella brushing her hair. No one sees her in the morning. They assume she’s still ill.

Mr Hyde returns and says he’s seen Arabella walking in the hills. She isn’t in the Stranges’ house. Jonathan uses his silver bowl but can’t find her in England, Wales, Scotland or France. A vision of people dancing in a shadowy hall appears in the bowl but Jonathan dismisses it. Jonathan, Henry, servants and neighbours go out to search for Arabella. When it gets dark they return to the house. Jonathan tells them he thought he saw her brushing her hair during the night but isn’t sure if she was there in the morning. Suddenly they hear a shout in the hall. It’s Arabella! Jonathan is shocked to see her in a black dress.

44 - Arabella

The lady neighbours take care of Arabella. She’s calm. She tells Jonathan she’s been walking. He questions her sharply. The ladies take her upstairs. There’s a pool of dark water with moss in it where she was standing. Arabella suffers pains then dies three days later.

Volume III - John Uskglass

45 - Prologue to The History and Practice of English Magic by Jonathan Strange

In the year 1110, a strange new army appeared in northern England. Ravens flew around it. A young woman kissed and danced with the soldiers. The next day her body was found drained of blood.

The army was the Fairy Host. They fought their way to York. Animals were attracted to the army.

The King summoned his advisers. Fairies were present in England at that time. They were wicked and gifted but idle apart from winning battles. The Fairy Host rode south and met King Henry at Newark. They used magic to overcome the English army and win the battle. The leader of the Fairy Host, a teenage boy sometimes known as John Uskglass, stepped forward. He looked unusual and spoke in a strange language (Faerie) but was human.

The boy explained that a Norman nobleman had taken his family’s land and murdered his father. He was found by the Fairy Host as an abandoned baby and taken to Faerie where he lived for several years. He took the northern half of England as compensation and left King Henry the southern half. The boy was also a king in Faerie. He reigned over his English kingdom for more than 300 years and created the system of magic used by Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell blending fairy magic with human organisation. Much of his magic was forgotten.

46 - “The sky spoke to me …”

Childermass is in Mr Norrell’s library writing a letter to a minister about using magic to control rivers.

He finds himself on a road in a dark landscape. The natural world around him seems to be full of magic and symbolic meaning. He’s not sure if he’s in Mr Norrell’s library or the magical landscape.

Childermass thinks the magic he’s seeing must come from Mr Norrell. The sky speaks to Childermass in a language he doesn’t understand. He asks Mr Norrell’s servant Lucas to fetch Mr Norrell. Lucas takes him to Mr Norrell’s study but he isn’t there. Jonathan Strange hasn’t been to the house either.

Childermass is thinking more clearly but can still picture the landscape. He does a spell to detect magic. The magic is in the square in front of the house. People are in the square hoping to see Mr Norrell. Childermass goes down into the square to find out who has been doing magic. There’s strong magic there. The sky seems to ask him a question, the answer to which will change English magic forever and be greater than what Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell are doing. He struggles to understand it.

Mr Norrell arrives in his carriage and the people approach him. Childermass thinks he recognises a fashionably dressed young lady. She aims a pistol at Mr Norrell. There’s a struggle. Childermass finds himself facing the lady with the pistol in the magical landscape. She’s shooting from Faerie at Mr Norrell’s heart in England. He can’t stop her. She fires the pistol.

Back in Hannover Square, Childermass realises he’s the one who’s been shot. As he recovers, he has weird dreams.

Mr Norrell asks him why he performed the spell. Childermass says Mr Norrell taught him it. He tells Mr Norrell about the magical landscape and the lady who shot him. He thinks the land is Faerie and the lady might be a magician. Mr Norrell says the lady is Lady Pole. She stole Sir Walter’s duelling pistol. Stephen Black had the key to the cabinet in which it was kept.

Mr Norrell decides not to prosecute Lady Pole for Sir Walter’s sake. She’ll be sent away to the country.

He tells Childermass the magic in the square was the magic he used to bring Lady Pole back from the dead. Childermass thinks it was the magic that’s all around in nature. A magic far greater than Mr Norrell or Jonathan Strange’s magic.

Mr Norrell tells Childermass that Arabella is dead. Childermass pictures himself back on the dark road in the bleak landscape with Arabella walking ahead of him.

Lady Pole is very upset about Arabella’s death and blames Mr Norrell.

Childermass remembers what Vinculus said: “All magicians lie and this one more than most”.",7,1769100952.0,bookclub,12,1.0,False

I don't want to regret this opportunity.","I’m a 21 year old college guy living in a dorm, and there’s a girl on my floor who I’m really into. She’s honestly way above my league, social, confident, pretty, the whole deal. We’ve talked a few times in passing, nothing deep, just normal hallway stuff. She’s always been polite and easy to talk to, which somehow makes this harder, not easier. I’m autistic, and situations like this really overwhelm my nervous system. I’m not exaggerating when I say I start sweating just thinking about asking her out. My chest tightens, my brain goes blank, and I replay every possible outcome on a loop.

I keep going back and forth between just doing it and worrying about making things awkward on my own floor. I’m genuinely scared of misreading signals or coming off as creepy without meaning to. At the same time, I know myself well enough to know that if I do not try, this will turn into one of those regrets I carry around for years. I am not expecting anything huge or romantic. I would be happy just asking her to grab coffee and seeing how it goes.

What I am looking for is grounded advice from a body language and vibe perspective. How do you approach something like this calmly when your anxiety is already high before you even speak. What signs should I watch for in the moment that tell me to continue or to back off respectfully. I want to handle this like an adult, be clear and respectful, accept whatever answer I get, and still be able to walk past her in the hallway without feeling ashamed or wanting to disappear.",2,1769100898.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False

1qjztoi,https://www.reddit.com/r/macapps/comments/1qjztoi/building_a_text_editor_at_the_same_table_where/,Building a text editor at the same table where Cortázar (spiritually) drank his coffee.,"[code vs stories](https://preview.redd.it/7lwt4p67hxeg1.jpg?width=1792&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=88a187bbb390c0c75a13c075cf840d0a0b3f3bc5)

**Table of Instructions**

In the style of Julio Cortázar's *Rayuela* (Hopscotch), this story can be read in two ways:

1. **The Logical Way (The Engineer):** Read paragraphs **1, 2, 3, 4**. It’s the story of the tech stack.
2. **The Rayuela Way (The Writer):** Start with Paragraph **3**, jump to **1**, drop to **4**, and end with **2**. In this order, you’ll discover why code is also poetry.

**1. The Corner (Medrano & Cabrera)** I studied Engineering at UTN FRBA, a massive tech university in Buenos Aires. But my real classroom was a block and a half away: at **Café Cortázar**. I lived my entire degree there, literally 50 meters away. While my classmates debated algorithms in cold classrooms, I escaped to that corner. There, between the noise of the espresso machine and the smell of toasted bread, I wrote my Final Project. The table vibrated, people argued about politics and love, and I tried to make my code have the same rhythm as a Buenos Aires conversation. I wasn't looking for silence; I was looking for *life*.

**2. The Origin (El Buzón)** Perhaps the bar wasn't a refuge, but a womb. My father always owned bars. I grew up crawling between billiard tables and regular customers. Of all of them, **""El Buzón""** marked me the most—a historic bar in the Pompeya neighborhood where the tango legend Homero Manzi lived. As a child, I learned that bars don't sell coffee; they sell stories. I had no choice but to befriend the customers just to have someone to play with. I listened to their plots, their knots, and their endings. I love technology, yes, but my DNA is made of the narrative of those old Buenos Aires cafés.

**3. The Problem (The Digital Prison)** Years later, as a developer with 25 years of experience in C, Java, and Go, I sat down to write my own stories. And I felt suffocated. Modern tools (Word, Scrivener) didn't feel like *Café Cortázar*; they felt like a bureaucratic office full of buttons, distractions, and endless subscriptions. Modern software had forgotten the ""life."" I wanted a tool that felt like that wooden table: solid, simple, eternal. I wanted to program something that had the structure of steel (Rust) but the soul of an old book.

**4. The Result (Rayuela Editor)** That is how this project was born. It’s not just a text editor in Rust; it’s my attempt to digitize that atmosphere. I named it **Rayuela** (Hopscotch) not just for the book, but for the game. Because writing is jumping from one side to another—from code to prose, from English to Spanish, from logic to emotion—without falling.

I coded it thinking of the engineering student needing to finish his thesis and the child listening to tangos in Pompeya. It’s free, it’s local-first, and it’s my love letter to literature and code.

I stayed frozen there for about an hour or more, unable to move or snap out of it.

While this was happening, I even found myself wishing for a panic attack—just to feel *something*—because the emptiness was so intense.

When I got home, headphones and music were the only thing that helped me calm down.

Simon Sinek dropped this wild observation in a podcast, something about thigh muscle strength correlating with friendship quality. At first I laughed it off. Then I dove into the research behind it (books, studies, fitness communities) and realized he's onto something bigger than just gym advice. 



Here's the thing. We've all been conditioned to think friendship is about personality, charisma, being ""fun."" But biology plays a massive role we completely ignore. Weak thigh muscles often mean you're sedentary. Sedentary means isolated. Isolated means your brain literally starts shutting down social pathways. It's not that you're awkward, your nervous system is just in survival mode.



Physical movement unlocks social connection



Your body produces oxytocin (the bonding hormone) when you move with others. Group fitness classes, hiking clubs, pickup sports, these aren't just hobbies. They're biological hacks for friendship.

Stronger legs mean you're more likely to say yes to spontaneous plans. Walking to meet someone, standing at a concert, dancing at a party. When your body feels capable, your social world expands automatically.

 There's something primal about shared physical experience. Humans bonded over hunting, gathering, building. Now we bond over suffering through a HIIT class or complaining about sore quads. Same mechanism, different context.



Start stupidly small. Join a beginner yoga class. Find a walking group on Meetup. Try a climbing gym where everyone's naturally encouraging each other. The friendship part happens as a byproduct, not the main goal.



Your environment is working against you



""The Village Effect"" by Susan Pinker is INSANE for understanding this. She's an award winning psychologist who studied the world's Blue Zones (places where people live longest). The common thread wasn't diet or exercise alone, it was face to face interaction. Daily. Physical. In person. She breaks down how modern life has engineered loneliness into our daily routines, and why our bodies are literally rejecting it. This book made me realize my apartment layout was designed for isolation. Best sociology read I've encountered.



[BeFreed](https://share.google/875wthGtMADKmINzC) is an AI learning app that turns expert knowledge into personalized audio content. Built by Columbia grads and former Google engineers, it pulls from research papers, books, and expert talks to create custom podcasts on exactly what you need. For friendship skills, you can set your depth anywhere from a 10 minute overview to a 40 minute deep dive with real examples. The adaptive learning plan adjusts based on your progress and goals. Plus there's Freedia, an avatar coach you can chat with about specific social struggles, it recommends content that fits your situation and helps you actually retain what matters through smart flashcards.



Ash app helped me understand my attachment patterns. Turns out I had avoidant tendencies making me bail on plans last minute. The AI coach asks questions that make you realize why you self sabotage friendships. It's like having a therapist who actually gets how messy your brain is at 2am.



Modern architecture, car dependent cities, remote work, these aren't just inconveniences. They're eliminating the casual daily interactions humans need. You're not broken for struggling to make friends in this setup. The system is just fundamentally anti social.



Stop trying to ""click"" immediately



Friendship researchers (yes, that's a real field) found it takes roughly 200 hours to become close friends with someone. Not 200 hours of deep conversation. 200 hours of just existing near each other.

 ""Platonic"" by Dr. Marisa Franco is the blueprint here. She's a psychologist specializing in friendship science, and this book won a bunch of awards for completely reframing how we think about making friends. She destroys the myth of instant connection and shows why consistency beats chemistry. The chapter on ""presuming people like you"" changed how I approached every social situation. Genuinely the best friendship manual that exists.



We've been brainwashed by romantic comedy logic. Friendships aren't love at first sight. They're built through repetition, low stakes hangouts, showing up even when it's boring.



Join the same coffee shop at the same time weekly. Take the same fitness class. Volunteer regularly. The people who keep showing up become your people, not because you're soulmates, but because proximity and consistency create trust.



The vulnerability gap



 Most people wait for someone else to be vulnerable first. So everyone's just surface level forever. Someone has to break the script.

Try: ""I've been struggling with loneliness lately"" instead of ""How's work?"" The responses you get will filter for actual friend material versus people just passing time.



Insight Timer has these friendship focused meditations that helped me sit with the discomfort of reaching out. Loneliness feels like shame, like admitting you're defective. The meditations reframe it as a normal human signal, like hunger or thirst. Once I stopped judging myself for wanting connection, making friends got exponentially easier.



Your body keeps the score. If you're anxious, depleted, stuck in fight or flight from too much isolation, your social skills suffer. Not because you lack skills, but because your nervous system is screaming danger. 



Friendship isn't a personality contest. It's a biological need that requires physical movement, consistent exposure, and environments designed for human connection. Most of us are trying to make friends in setups engineered for loneliness, then blaming ourselves when it doesn't work.

I graduated college in 2023 and lived at home for a bit, and now living with my long-term boyfriend in a town about 30 minutes from my parents house and where I grew up. The transition to post-grad life has been pretty hard even almost 3 years later now, and I think it mostly has to do with living close to home still but also living somewhere pretty rural rather than being in a city/place I love where theres actually people my age who I could make friends with.

Making new friends where I live isn't easy, and my workplace is very small and I'm the youngest one by far so thats out. I do go to a gym but making friends there isn't easy either, and I'm not an outgoing person to begin with. I guess I'm just looking for anyone who is experiencing this too and any advice.

I have guy friends and I hang out with them sometimes. It’s always been platonic and I’ve been open about it. Early on, before we were even officially dating, my boyfriend accused me of cheating because I went to get coffee with a guy friend. That caused a lot of drama back then.

Fast forward to now. My boyfriend doesn’t really have female friends, but the few he does have, he’s had history with. Recently, he hung out with one of them and didn’t tell me. I kept calling him, he said he’d call me back later, and when I pushed, he finally told me he was with her.

I got really mad and reacted badly. I sent messages demanding to know who he was with and said stuff like “we’re done” and “don’t contact me.” I know that part was impulsive and probably cringe.

At the same time, I feel like my reaction didn’t come out of nowhere. He was very strict and suspicious about my friendships in the past, but now expects me to be chill when he hangs out with someone he has history with and doesn’t even mention it.

Religion was invented to help explain the origin of earth and consciousness in humans. It is still clung to because the majority of people have a hard time grasping the idea that the universe is a big uncaring physical phenomenon.

We don’t understand the brain and the science behind emotions so we invented a branch of medicine that pretends to medicalize the emotions.

Psychiatry is not real medicine. While some people BELIEVE it helps them or has saved their life, this is unproven. The best you can say for psychiatry is that the medications are mild sedatives that calm the emotions in anxious types. Or the stimulant type meds help those with attention difficulties become a little more focused.

Basically psychiatrists are bartenders: alcohol if you’re anxious, coffee if you’re sleepy.

Again, not real medicine.

The downside: people think psychiatrists are real doctors treating real illnesses. The end result: lots of harm, dependent and child abuse, especially when you add manipulative narcissistic parents/spouses/significant others into the mix.

Those manipulative types can be either gender but the ones who get away with it most proficiently are women.

The female narcissist is the most dangerous offender out there because we default trust in women caregivers to not be malicious liars.

When they are, they cause more localized damage than any man possibly could.

I failed the bar exam, and at the same time, the person who meant the most to me chose to let go of our relationship. A perfect combination of loss. The last time I remember crying this hard was when one of my parents died.

For days now, I’ve been crying nonstop, sobbing, hiding in the bathroom, and letting the sound of running water drown out my breakdowns. I don’t even know why it’s this intense.

Maybe it’s because these emotions have been piling up for so long, bottled inside me since the review period, with no space to let them out.

Maybe it’s because Christmas is over and people have gone back to their normal lives. There’s finally room to grieve, no more crowded family reunions, and no forced smiles.

Maybe it’s because now, I finally have the time to cry everything out of my chest. I’m no longer thinking about readings. I’m no longer worried about wasting time when I cry. There’s no work to distract me, only stacked family responsibilities and setbacks that make everything feel heavier.

Maybe it’s because just thinking that my special person will not be there with me when I take the bar again breaks my heart.  Just the way it is, always leaving whenever I needed the most, every time I needed time, space, love, understanding, or any kind of consideration in my life.

I don’t know how to get back up and start again. So many things are happening all at once. My eyes are exhausted from sleepless nights. I was even forced to drink coffee earlier because I forgot to say my order should be non-coffee. My eyebags are swollen, and my heart aches from crying too much.

The very things I used to remind my special person—rest your eyes, go jogging or walking, eat healthy food, and drink plenty of water— I can barely do any of them myself now. I have no appetite. I’m dehydrated. I isolated myself because I don’t have many friends I can reach out to.  My energy is drained, and I’m drowning in my own thoughts. It’s a mercy that I was still able to interact with people earlier today, only because I had documents to process at an agency.

I don’t know if I can still juggle everything. I can’t rely on my family to help with the expenses for the bar. I need to find a job as soon as possible just to catch up with enrollment for the review. I know I have to move forward even if it hurts. But I don’t know how yet. I’m not ready.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1qjz6a0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1qjz6a0/castenada_part_38/,Castenada (Part 38),"For the last few years, I had been spending my Autumn mornings drinking coffee on my front porch. Sometimes I’d be joined by a neighbor, family, or some other visitor wanting to learn more about the Castenada Historical Society, a project I was partially responsible for.

It was primarily the brainchild of Caleb Auburn who had since retired after losing his last re-election, ending a four-term streak making him the longest recurrent mayor Castenada has ever had. I didn’t have a strong like or dislike of Caleb, he always seemed sort of distant from his constituents and more actively dealing with civic projects around town. I had always heard he spent more time entertaining the Espinosas and various out-of-town developers with multi-million dollar contracts than he did attending cook-offs, parades, or the Summer Days celebrations. But in my time getting to know the human being who owned the name, I found him to be a quiet, thoughtful, and introspective individual. In some ways he reminded me of my grandfather, not only because of his distant Ooikima-Spanish heritage that gave him similar facial features (I think he’s technically a distant cousin of mine), but because of that same reserved demeanor he exhibited that hid a deeply inquisitive mind.

Occasionally, he’d join me in my morning ritual, but not this morning. Rain pelted the roof hard. I hadn’t managed to get around to cleaning the gutters over the summer so water was dumping out into a small but growing pond in my yard. I couldn’t imagine anyone would have much interest in making the trek up to Hazel Hills in this weather, so I had instead turned my attention to the lifelong pet project: restoring a dead language.

The tongue of the Ooikima was only one of the things taken from us. There are no living fluent native speakers of it, the last one being in my great grandparents’ generation. My grandfather knew a little bit, but rarely spoke it and could only manage a few simple phrases and the odd curse word whenever he stubbed his toe on the old woodfire stove in the winters. My grandmother fared little better, only understanding what her husband had taught her. She would later tell me when I was grown and after he had passed that “tłiwáq” meant “piss” and “láxwani” was an old word that was used to refer to an evil spirit, but was more recently used to refer to the devil or a demon. He would use another word that somewhat baffled me: “K̓łu’us wéwé.” I’d ask my grandmother what it meant, but she would dismiss it as nonsense. I would use these words without thinking about it, usually whenever someone cut me off in traffic or if I accidentally spilled something. As I got older, I became more and more detached from the meaning of those words and what context they may have meant to the people who taught them to my grandfather.

Later, I would meet other Ooikima. It’s a common misconception that there are only two extended families of us left. We are simply the only Ooikima left \*in Castenada\*. Most Ooikima remaining after Spanish colonization were forced out of the valley and sent to live on one of the reservations along with other Oregon Indians. Very few actually came back, often being met with obligations and traumas to keep them out of their ancestral lands. They knew as little of the language as I, but they had other pieces of the puzzle that I didn’t. Words for things I didn’t know. I learned that “méli” was a word used to refer to foxglove, a word I would later name my daughter. “Han” was a word for “place” or “home,” later used as a general term to refer to houses. I also unfortunately learned that the word “a’ashwo koochrá” was a common slang term for a woman’s posterior, though I would later learn that it was originally a term used to refer to expecting mothers which never ceases to make me chuckle.

My journey of assembling the puzzle didn’t stop there. I spent a great deal of time studying linguistics in college. While indigenous language courses weren’t as robust back then, I can at least still speak a smattering of Russian and Spanish. Nonetheless, my studies proved useful when I later started getting my hands on old journals and historical documents written by Anglo-American colonizers. Many of them had Anglicized pronunciations of Ooikima words and concepts, though they only scratched the surface of any deeper meaning. Cultural context was severely lacking from even the most comprehensive transliteration glossaries available.

For example, they would list “tła’ooiné” as a general word for “cave,” but I have it on good authority that Tła’ooiné was used to refer to a specific cave, namely what Anglo-Americans somehow renamed Tatonga Cave. There was likely a miscommunication when Edgar Warren found Tła’ooiné and asked Idháshoot what the Ooikima word for “cave’ was. Of course, Idháshoot was likely confused by the question. All caves in the valley are all seen as individually unique pathways through the mountains to allow specific spirits to pass in and out. Sure, you could call Notre Dame a “church,” but it’s Notre Dame. Calling it a church would be a vast oversimplification. Idháshoot likely wouldn’t have had a generic term for “cave,” as each cave, mountain pass, and trampled bend through the woods was seen as an “ooakar” or “sacred path.” But “ooakar” still is too generic a term to use, so he went with the proper name instead.

On the subject of Tła’ooiné, the feds decided that particular ooakar was \*their\* property back in the 60’s. They decided that the runes found within, no doubt tied to our history and possibly confirming that we had a written language before even the Sumerians, was of little interest after their collective of so-called experts deemed it an “inconclusive dead-end” without \*any\* consultation from the Ooikima people. Of course, all this happened when I was very young. My aunties and uncles protested along with some hippies that came up from California, but to no avail. They mined into the earth anyway and did who knows how much damage to the land. We may never know because Tła’ooiné remains closed off to this day.

These misconceptions of our language and interferences would continue, further muddying the waters and making the job of well-meaning linguists like myself all that much more difficult. Years of interviews. Years of separating unreliable narrators from truth. Years of advocacy and protest. Years of compiling research and tracing stray words to their source. It’s been a long and arduous journey to restore what was taken from us and still there’s more work to be done even long after I’m gone. But for now, I sip my coffee and listen to the deluge patter off my roof and through the leaves, thinking to myself about things I already know.

A pair of headlights flashed by as they rounded the bend. A red Tacoma, somehow still running after all these years. Logan would sometimes stop by, sometimes just pass on through. He had taken an interest in the Historical Society when he was still a youngster, but he often finds himself too embroiled in the muck of adulthood to pay me visits as often as he used to. His auntie Violet keeps him busy at the farm whenever he doesn’t have his daughter Kayla to take care of. I hardly hear much from the Deepwaters these days. So much tragedy and conflict in that family ever since Kála passed on, like she was the load-bearing pillar that kept them all together. Horrible to watch from an arm’s length, but I can only do so much. Hell, not like I’ve been able to hold down a husband myself.

To my surprise, the Tacoma made its way up the driveway. Misty, my blue healer, gave a yip before getting up from her place by my feet to greet Logan. He usually had treats on him if not the scent of his own pup that always was sure to draw her interest. He was wearing his usual rancher hat and Moc Toes. I chuckled quietly to myself watching her go to him, but to my surprise, Méli was with him. Méli was supposed to be staying at her dad’s across town for the weekend, but here she was without any of her things getting dropped off by Logan. The chuckling was done, I was going to rip that man a new asshole, that much was clear. I got to my feet and set my coffee down as I slid on my moccasins. I marched over and I must’ve looked righteously furious because Logan was already raising his hands in the air like I had a gun pointed at him.

“Álauni, Amaya,” he greeted. “I brought Méli here from town because…”

“Oh no, you don’t need to tell me, Logan.” I said, eyeing Méli who was shrinking in the passenger seat. “I already know: she snuck out with that Sharpe boy and her pops found out about it this time.”

“Not quite, Amaya. She has…”

“To get her sorry butt out of the truck? I agree!”

Méli cranked the window down just far enough so I couldn’t wring her neck. Not that I would, but the option was tempting. “Mom, I have something! It’s not what you think!”

“Have what? An STD?”

She rolled her eyes. “Ew, mom! No! It’s a book from the library. History of Castenada. Do you know about it?”

She presented the black leatherbound book and my mood softened a bit. “Who wrote it?” I asked.

“Doesn’t say.” she shrugged, “It was left in the sci-fi section by some boy from school.”

I heaved a sigh, relieved I didn’t have to be mama bear this time and could settle into doing my job on a Sunday. “Alright, bring it in. But you’re going straight back to your pops’ after, you hear me?”

“Yes, mom.” she groaned.

I walked back up to the house, Logan, Misty, and Méli following behind me. I made certain to pick up my coffee mug as we made our way in through the front door to the living room I had since converted into an impromptu third office that happened to also have a large futon, a TV, and a treadmill that has been gathering dust since the 90’s. I turned on my leopard-shaded desk lamp and sat down to look over the contents of the book.

Looked to be an early 70’s or late 60’s printing based on the smell of the paper. The inside cover confirmed my suspicion, but there was no information about any kind of publisher or writer, just a print date of 1970, an ISBN, and a printer listed as Barker House. I made a note of it and moved on. No dedication, no table of contents, no bibliography from what I could tell. This seemed like maybe a self-publish, but it looked far too professionally bound especially for the time and it wouldn’t make sense for it to have an ISBN if it wasn’t intended for commercial sale anyway unless it was just nonsense. The book was broken up into what looked like chapters for each decade, beginning roughly in the latter 1790s and ending in the 1960s. Each chapter was accompanied with either an illustration or a black & white photograph. For the 1790s it was what looked like a drawing of what I assumed was a representation of Don Johan’s chapel, though it was destroyed long ago and to my knowledge I haven’t seen any illustrations of it in our archives.

1800 to 1830 had more illustrations, mostly of generic wagons and colonizer constructions. 1840 had the first photograph, this one of a few miners standing outside of the Castenada Saloon, a place that would later be torn down in 1892 to build another tavern called Jack’s owned by Jackson Wescott only to be burned down in 1898. For several years it was used as storage until it was purchased by Samuel Clint in 1934 and changed to Sam’s. After that, I think it burned down again in 1936. The land was left an unused lot until it eventually sold and someone built a diner on it in 1951 that’s still there to this day.

“Anything cool?” Logan asked from the kitchen, pouring himself some coffee in my daffodil mug.

“There’s a picture of the old saloon with a couple of miners.” I replied, continuing to flip through. Méli sat opposite of me in an office chair, quietly watching me turn the pages.

1880 had a not-so-rare photograph of Archibald Montgomery. Chep Montgomery saw to it that they’d be plastered in whatever public building made the mistake of letting him in through the front door. Thankfully he stopped writing me emails about his “legacy” and questions he had about the novel Dune (no idea) years ago. I’d like to think ever since CPBC went off the air he’s had the good sense to leave the rest of the town alone, but I think it’s more likely he just doesn’t have his megaphone to shout at us with. I had heard he had a blog now, but I don’t know who the hell reads those anyhow.

Flipping forward, I eventually reached the 1910s and stopped dead in my tracks. A man with long black hair, a black leather hat with an eagle’s feather sticking out of it, steely green eyes, and coy grin. Maybe that grin was infectious because I could feel it spreading across my face as I looked up at Méli.

“This here, this is my great grandfather. Your great, great grandfather.” I held up the book for her to see. “Detective James Hill.”

“Really?” Méli asked, her attention peaked. “He was a detective?”

“Not just any detective,” I said. “He helped bring the Lakeside Killer to justice.”

“No way!” I heard Logan call as he came in from the kitchen, having helped himself to a muffin. “Your great granddad took down the Lakeside Killer?”

“Who was the Lakeside Killer?” Méli asked, taking a chunk of Logan’s muffin.

“Hey! I was eating that, kid!”

“Well, now so am I.” She then pointed at me. “Proceed.”

I had been spending the better part of the last hour walking knee-deep in muck looking for anything the brass might’ve missed. Clothing fragments, tools, hell, I’d even take a few stray drops of blood if we got it. The way this guy had done it was unlike anything I’d seen in all my years of detective work. Probably the reason I got called in for this one, but then more likely it was on account that I was one of the few bloodhounds left on the leash that didn’t get drafted to fight krauts. The body they found was a female in her late 30’s stripped completely naked, left arm completely removed at the shoulder along with a few of her teeth, a sizeable hunk of her of liver, and a tract of large intestine, several stab wounds most likely made posthumously for aforementioned organ removal, and blunt force trauma to the head which was ruled the killing blow by the coroner. Ugly sight for a couple of picnickers to find on a sunny Sunday afternoon after church. But I had no similar luck finding anything among the cattails as the rainclouds started to gather up again. 

I returned to shore and removed my galoshes and chest waders before seeking cover under the gazebo before it started to hail. I’d left my lunch pail at a table and obliged myself to enjoy my liverwurst on rye as hunks of ice pelted the roof above. I ate, staring off at the lake and the few houses built alongside its shore, wondering if maybe the guy I was looking for was watching me eat my lunch from afar. Sort of a dumb thought, no detective I’ve known has been that lucky. But even still… \*Ta’al ikta kukwani\*. ‘Strange things may happen.’ That’s when I noticed in the middle distance a man walking towards me.

Everything about his demeanor immediately struck me as queer. No umbrella, caked in mud, clothes soaked. His blue eyes shone like pebbles of turquoise, a grin full of yellowing teeth beaming wide. I had fully set aside the liverwurst and was slowly standing up, anticipating his next move. He spoke just barely loud enough for me to hear over the din of the rain: “To Portent, I commend my work. Let the journey be long.”

“Heya, friend!” I called out, hands at my sides and subtly presenting the pistol holstered in my belt. “You out here by yourself?”

“We’re never alone… We are pillars in the temple of the Emperor.” He splayed his fingers apart, and that’s when I saw the blood on his palms and the hunting knife fall free from his grasp. With a lightning flourish, I drew but didn’t fire.

“Hold it! Hands behind your head!” I called. The man fell to his knees, locking his fingers between blonde curls of muddied tangles of hair. The smile of his never faded, his eyes like a hungry wolf never leaving mine. I approached and cuffed him. He smelled of rot. Not of any particular kind of rot, but an all encompassing stench of decomposition. It didn’t take long for me to notice the bloodied thing on the shore. When I finally gave it a look over, it never left me all these years later. Thinking about it now as I sit in a rocking chair on my porch, watching my grandkids play, this life feels like a shell even now.

edit: this is a long post so please don't get offended..........  
so for a little context:

1. English is not my first language so there might be some error in spelling and grammar please try to understand me T\_T
2. i struggled for almost 5 years and in those 5 years i realised a lot of things which i will discuss in this post
3. this post is mainly for appearance and/or any manifestation in which you feel like you are stuck for a long time and feel like you are having hard time with detachment, desperation and demotivation

soo without wasting your time let's begin,

back in the year 2020, i first knew about manifestation and learned that it could help me with my body (i was 14 y/o)  
me (to me ): oh cool now i can get my desired appearance and look good again (i was very beautiful at that age and i realise now, i was everything i want now), i can have slimmer thighs with huge gap, stick thin arms, flat belly with ""ribs showing"", flat chested, hollow cheeks, grey eyes, ghost pale skin, now i can achieve them all great!!!  
my mind: alright master as you say lets manifest

(ik my mindset was effed up that time and now i am very grateful that i didn't actually achieved them, it was very badly messed up also yeah so at that time i was an adolescent so yes my lady parts were growing  and i am born with chubby cheeks so i was pretty cute too and my body was not tea but coffee, hot and strong but the people around me were like all these desires i told above will make you very beautiful try doing workouts and diets and you will look gorgeous, as they were adults and i was a mere teenager already dealing with body issues i agreed and tried working and manifesting  
no i am not saying that working out is bad but i feel like at that age my mindset towards working out was pretty messed up, i only wanted to be slimmer lighter and not stronger)

people around me: oh honey try to be more slimmer you will look very beautiful

teenager me (inside my brain): oh no it's not working i am still fat and ugly nothing ever works for me i can't get this i hate my body i hate the way i look i can never be beautiful

my brain: alright master, now we are ugly and we hate our body

This loop continued for years............

andddd as a result 4 years later my body actually reacted, not only my looks went downhill but also my health and i the hate for my body? i was not able to look at my body in mirror or photos and just dreaded going for shopping

i never felt good.....

i tried everything, every manifestation video, subliminal, ""Manifestation coach"" tips and what not and everytime i heard the same thing:

1. show gratitude/ be grateful for your desire
2. act as if
3. detach
4. let it go
5. love yourself

and i was like fineee-ah i love you now please for god's sake show me the result i wanna feel worthy and pretty and get all the attention  
my precious brain: alright that summarizes to we are unworthy, ugly, and no one pays attention to us. noted. now this is our reality  
and as i repeated all this again and again and with strong emotions like hate and sadness it got manifested pretty fast. As a result i hated my looks, i never felt worthy enough for anyone's love and/or attention, my looks became bad and i lost all the attention that i used to get from strangers and known people around me

i thought it was because i was not consistent enough, i didn't believed enough, i didn't visualise perfectly and  i had some severe brain damage that were delaying my results because everyone else manifests within hours but me?? never  
so i constantly jumped between subliminals and manifestation methods, was never consistent with anything, doubted everything, ""fake loved "" myself and was like super desperate to ""be pretty"" and yeah these doubts also ruined my ability to visualise and did some serious damage to my nervous system because it was so tensed up during my meditation and manifestation

i tried to seek help from this community, youtube, pinterest, etc.

and that's where my healing journey started  
so i will tell you everything i learned and keeping this post short:

1. i heard about ho'oponopono prayer and practiced it
2. from few posts in this community i realised actual self-love and self-worth and
3. i learned to visualise again and calmed my nervous system down
4. realise what i actually want and get it the right way

here's what i did:

in a post i read that you are not trying to change yourself but actually you are reminding yourself that yes i already have it, honestly this was the pos that changed everything for me.

every time i affirm i quickly change it to yeah i am my dream appearance in a tone that duh i remember i already am

and the major shift was this:

case 1:

me looking for ""workout results"" to help me motivate throughout my workout  
my brain: buddy didn't you told me you already are slim and beautiful as you want to ?  
me: yeah i did and what?  
my brain: so if you are already that then why are you straining yourself? i mean a day's break won't cause any harm  
me: wait actually that makes sense, i train to maintain my body not to get what i already have, thanksss

case 2:

me looking for manifestation methods to use because yk muscle memory  
my brain: now why do you need another method?  
me: cuz yk i wanna mani- oh yeah i already have it thanks for reminding me love yeah

case 3:

me struggling between the urges to sleep and looping affirmations overnight because i feel comfortable sleeping in complete silence  
my brain: dude again?????  
me: what??  
my brain: remember you have it then why torture yourself?  
me: oh yeah, goodnighttt

case 4:

me in my meditation after ho'oponopono prayer, here i saw younger me, sad crying and with so hate in her eyes that it actually hurts  
present me: why are so sad and why are you looking at me with so much hate?  
younger me: i thought you'd understand but you didn't. we dealt with so much pain and hate from others and i felt like atleast i am safe with myself but you were so harsh on yourself, you hated yourself so much and didn't even looked at yourself like you actually believe them and are proving them right  
i deserved love, i deserved care, i felt unworthy from everyone but i thought you will make me feel safe but you were worse than them  
and this conversation was so heartfelt that i finished my meditation in tears and from that day i healed my inner child and i realised the self love and i stopped relying on external assurance

case 5:

me looking for proof that my manifestation is coming  
my brain: okay lets end this once and for all  
me: alright  
my brain: so let's say you get gorgeous nail extension that you wanted, you see them, feel excited, post about it show it to your friends and family and every one says its gorgeous and compliment you, next day you again see them, you show them to your friends and family again, and you do this daily for next 1 week, will you have  the same excitement? will everyone compliment you the same every single day?  
me: uhm no but why are you asking this  
my brain: lemme finish please  
okay you won't be excited but will you hate it?  
me: no  
my brain: if people acted shocked after a week will you still like that reaction?  
me: no honestly that would feel fake  
my brain: will you constantly check them?  
me : honestly no it will be normal for me at that time  
my brain: exactly, you need to be the same with your body, when people say that act as if, they mean to make it so normal for your brain that it feels safe manifesting it for you  
you need to think as if you got your dream appearance for days and that way, you won't constantly check them so desperation and detachment issue solved, you will be fine if no one commented you, hence not looking for external validation and let's say you are going to an event and you are wearing a pretty dress, that time you will be grateful for having this body, so self doubts and hatred also resolved and your brain also feels like it's normal and safe, and mine ofc  
if i summarise it i would say, you need to see yourself as if you have it for days, it's normal for you, even if you are not excited all the time, it's still yours, even if you don't check it, it's yours, even if others don't act shocked, it's already yours and you don't need any proof for it BECAUSE IT'S YOURSSS  
me: HOLY MOLY RAVIOLI that makes sense  
thankyouu

and that's how i manifested appearance change after 5 years  
remember it all starts with healing and self love <3

i tried to make it as simple as i can

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

I’m doing Prozac again, the last time I did it I was in a weird spot in life and I can’t fully say why I stopped because I believed it to work well for me.

I remember things I used to like to do, like going to a coffee/book shop, thrifting, things I liked to do before that I stopped because of PTSD and anxiety and depression. I am also diagnosed BPD. But I woke up just wanting to do those things. I woke up, got a coffee, was singing and jamming in the car. 

I am aware of the anxiety that can come, but it’s nice to want to actually do things. Like I want to do my dishes and clean my apartment, it does feel a bit overwhelming, but usually I feel a dread and a fear or even leaving the house. When I’m outside I feel physically sick and I avoid people. Today I smiled at people. 

I hope this is a general idea of how Prozac will be, I think the last time I took it I was only on it for a couple months and my doctor is urging me to at least go to month 3 (I am notoriously known for stopping medications, I truly believe this is apart of my BPD, and also I’m quite medication sensitive). 

She’s starting me 20mg, and from I’m reading that’s high? I don’t think she started me at 20mg before.

But I will say, my depression has been an ongoing thing and it’s really bad right now. I’m on short term disability at work, I was bawling in her office just feeling worthless. I don’t think I’ve shown her that degree of my inner pain before after seeing her for 2 years now. So maybe that could be why? Idk. ",1,1769099175.0,prozac,2,1.0,False

Usamljenik i nekonformista čiji se čudesni indie filmovi na poseban način bave temama čovekove izolovanosti i neprilagođenosti savremenom društvu…

Tri njegova omiljena filma su mi:

\+Stranger Than Paradise – crno-bela poezija o otuđenju, tišini i besmislu svakodnevice

\+Night on Earth – noćni razgovori u taksijima širom sveta, mali životi uhvaćeni u par minuta

\+Coffee and Cigarettes – rituali, razgovori, neprijatne pauze i genijalna banalnost

Posebno mi je zanimljiva njegova saradnja sa Robertom Beninjijem, naročito u Down by Law – Beninji je tu potpuno drugačiji nego u svojim kasnijim, „glasnijim“ ulogama, a Džarmuš mu savršeno daje prostor da bude haotičan i nežan u isto vreme.

Koji je vama omiljeni Džarmušev film?

A ako računamo i Beninjija – koja vam je njihova najbolja saradnja?",11,1769099101.0,kinematografija,8,0.92,False

OP•[1m ago](/r/TRT_females/comments/1q94sf2/comment/o12j4hi/)

Bringing some updates. Just took my second dose of 5mg this week, making 10mg this first week of TRT.  I definitely feel a tingling and boost of energy almost like an underline anxiety feeling that comes when we drink too much coffee. Also already noticed more alertness and focus directed to action. Nothing major but noticeable.  Funny fact… my libido was higher the week before starting but I was already set and decided to start TRT. Maybe placebo effect? Or the results of resistance training and proper diet for the past 9 months finally also starting to support This perimenopause phase???  One thing I noticed this week which I don’t believe is in any case related to the T is that I am now in the beg-mid lutheal phase and my frequent urination is more frequent than ever. Last night I even felt a little burning session in the Urethra and the tickles like I had to go back to pee even immediately after peeing. Annoying and definitely worse than ever. I never had UTIs and doesn’t really feel like one but more like a hormonal shift.  I was wondering about starting the Glow Bellow DHEA vaginal cream. I have been listening to Dr Rachel Rubin and Dr Kelly on the wonders of DHEA for vaginal and Urinary tract health during peri. Any advice, tips or feedback? 

  
ps: also posted this as a comment as follow up on my previous post when I shared my initial fears with TRT last week. ",2,1769099065.0,TRT_females,15,1.0,False

I originally got a coolfly smart feeder last summer because I wanted better clips of my local woodpeckers, but lately, I’ve been spending my morning coffee time just scrolling through the community feed in the app instead. It’s a total trip. While I’m looking at six inches of snow out my window, I’m watching live captured clips of hummingbirds and parrots from users down in Brazil and Australia.  
  
It’s honestly been a huge help for the winter blues. It feels less like a social media feed and more like a global nature tour. It's wild to see what’s visiting a feeder thousands of miles away while my own yard is under six inches of snow.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )
