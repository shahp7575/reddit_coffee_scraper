this morning i walked past a stranger 
and knew how she likes her coffee 
where all of her birth marks are
to have a mother means learning to mourn the living 
to teach myself to tie my own shoes 
i find her in every half smoked cigarette
she leaves in the bathroom
she never tosses the milk when it’s gone bad
my mother hoards a carton for each year she did not see me turn
i am both twenty three and nine
every nursery rhyme she never learned the words to
i didn’t either, but you parent yourself 
and hum the melody long enough
the lyrics write themselves
through yearning comes art
each poem becomes a eulogy for the woman with the same freckles on her neck 
sometimes i see her and she’s just the girl who
didn’t season the meat enough 
forgot to run the laundry
let the tile get dusty again
her shrinkage spins in the dryer
while my father reminds her she’s done it wrong again 
i look at her and i see every time a man whispered me into nothing
and i think to myself maybe i am my mothers daughter

1g4h1s4,https://www.reddit.com/r/firstmarathon/comments/1g4h1s4/finished_my_first_marathon/,Finished my first marathon!,"This past Sunday I (28F) finished my first marathon! I wanted to share a little recap of how things went because I always found these kinds of posts helpful when I was training.


I carb loaded for a good 4 days before the run and woke up 3 hours before the race to get some food, coffee, and water in. I don't think I stretched out enough because my legs were definitely feeling a little tight as I made my way to the starting line.


Right from the beginning the entire experience felt surreal and my heart rate started out pretty high with all of the adrenaline and excitement of the event washing over me. The first 12 miles went by very quickly and I am proud of how I was able to pace myself on the first 1/3rd of the race, keeping things even and relaxed as people were passing me left and right.


I fueled pretty well, never felt like I hit a wall, but I did feel like my legs just weren't moving at the speed I wanted them to. I would think I was running a decent solid tempo pace and then my watch was telling me otherwise. I tried to stay very focused on the mile in front of me rather than the entire marathon which helped me stay positive and made the time go by faster.


I smiled at spectators, thanked volunteers, made friends with some fellow runners, and waved at and took photos of my family who came to support me. This helped to make me feel very motivated to keep going and gave me things to look forward to when things were getting a little tough.


I only took two breaks, one to change my shirt as the temp rose higher (this took longer than I wanted because I had to repin my bib on) and the other for a short walking break when my head phones died and I just needed a second to gather the motivation. 


Miles 19 and 23 were the hardest ones for me because both felt so close but yet so far away from the end. It's amazing how fast the first 5K goes and how slow the last 5K feels! Once I saw the finish line, however, I realized I had a lot more in the tank and I was able to sprint through the last .2 miles. 


Unfortunately my run on my Nike Run Club app didn't sync properly so my stats didn't upload to Strava but looking at my splits I was extremely consistent ranging from 10:45-12min miles the entire race. I finished at 5:02:15 with a bit of extra gas in the tank.


Initially, I was a little disappointed I didn't reach my sub 5 goal because I had been faster during some of my training runs. I think my weekly mileage was a bit too low this training block and I might have tapered down too much. My husband reminded me though that it was better that I paced myself and finished strong rather than go out too hard and not be able to finish. Us runners are so hard on ourselves that it's easy to get down on a few minutes rather than take a bigger perspective and realize that I just accomplished a major life goal of mine through nothing but my own grit and determination. 


I lost one toenail, gained a few blisters, but the pride and joy I felt at the end made everything worth it, so much so that I have already signed up for a half this spring :) ",1,1729022843.0,firstmarathon,0,1.0,False

I attribute it to: fully cutting out caffeine, switching to healthier and more filling meal options instead of fast carbs, eating minimal added sugar ( i’ve been eating around recommended 25g a day for 10 days ), as well as sleeping 7-9 hours at the same time. As well as probably getting mostly over the withdrawal fatigue ( as i haven’t been addicted THAT strongly or long - before quitting i drank coffee almost daily for only 5 years with 4 of them being just one cup ) 

This time around I’ve noticed that my caffeine & sugar addictions go hand and hand. So my last few times trying to quit either failed. 

My takeway from this is that if you dear reader is that other lifestyle choices are most likely required if you want to feel better. ",1,1729022743.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

I'm looking for recommendations for a coffee machine for our office, with a budget of around $750. Ideally, I want an automatic machine with a built-in bean grinder that can make coffee, espresso, cappuccino, etc. It should be intuitive and not require a lot of maintenance (since that will likely fall on me! 😅).

We’ll probably brew about 40-50 cups a week max, so nothing too intense—just something reliable and efficient. Bonus points if it can be connected to a water hook-up by the sink, but that's not a dealbreaker.

Here are a few options I’ve found so far:

* **De'Longhi Magnifica ESAM3300**
* **Gaggia Brera Super Automatic Espresso Machine**
* **Philips 3200 Series Fully Automatic Espresso Machine w/ LatteGo**
* **Breville BES870XL Barista Express**

I’m not the easiest person to be around, I’m the first one to admit that. I’m too much of an introvert to start a conversation with, and when I’m more comfortable with someone I start to talk too much, without any thinking, so much that it becomes annoying to some people and I can understand that. I’m too much of an OCD freak. If something does not go according to plan, it’s like my world is collapsing all round me and I get mad without any important reason. The last part is something that I have tried very hard to overcome, and I have made big steps, so that at least, I don’t let it show to other people and nag about it. 

I don’t like going out for coffees and drinks and dancing. I prefer staying at home watching movies and anime. I like studying and peace and quiet. I’m severely agoraphobic. Countless time, I have had panic attacks in very crowded places, and once I even fainted. 

I’m 24 years old, and I’ve never had any friendship last more than 3 years. The first friendships that I had in my childhood were stopped because I moved away. After that time, each friend group that I was in , did something that I did not like, eg. catfishing me (a girl was making herself as a boy and was hitting on me on Social media, and stupid 15 year old me believed it), and bullying other kids (at this point I was in high school and my need to be accepted was on another level – even doing things that I regret to this day). 

Aside from that, as a quiet kid, of course, I was bullied at one point or another, thankfully nothing major. And when the major thing happened ( = the hits started), I was brave enough to go to the director and not only tell him anything but saying that I was willing to go to the police if it didn’t stop. We live in a small rural town so this got out quickly and no one ever approached me again. 

My last year on high school, I think is the one that I remember most fondly out of all my years in school. By that time, I had distanced myself from everyone and I was not in any group. I was talking to my classmates of course, but I was always the last one to be remembered about a party (if any at that) and I was okay with it. I was thinking that when I would get into university I would make finally long lasting friends. 

And that’s what happened. I made a group of close friends and we hang out well together. Then covid came and our group did not meet up for one whole year, but we were talking every day through our group chat. 

I have to say that I’m not a person whose program is easy to go around, normally. All throughout my university years I was working in my father’s shop, while also trying to finish my university in 4 years, so that I could start working as soon as possible in my field. So, every Friday noon, I was leaving the city that I studied and returned home to work. As you can guess, we were trying to go out for drinks on weekdays, and they seemed to be okay with it. At that point I was really trying to change myself and pushed myself to do things that I did not like, even going out for drinks when I didn’t want to, thinking that I will start to like it eventually. In the end, it’s all about the people and not the activity, right?

After covid everything changed. At the summer when the restrictions started lifting I got my first job on the field, even though I had not yet gotten my diploma, and I was so happy with it. In general, its kind of difficult to find job in that field in my country (I will not disclose the country and the field for privacy reasons). But it seemed like my friends were not that thrilled for me. The job was on my hometown so I was not going as much to the city of my university, but I was telling them that if they wanted, we could arrange to meet somewhere in the middle (at the time I did not have my driver’s license so it was difficult for me to go), and they were rude to me sometimes. 

At first I thought that it was in my imagination, but when university started and I stopped my summer job, my program went back to how it was. They started ditching me. They started to interrupt my plans with a girl on the group because they wanted her to go out with them, but me they didn’t care, I was an afterthought, and only because I was in front of her when they called her to go, they invited me. Also, no one cared to inform me that they were going out for drinks to celebrate the coming of another friend to the town, and only by the stories on Social Media did I learn it. 

The few times that we went out after that, they were cold, they were ignoring me when I was asking questions, or dismissing me. I have had enough, and after a big shout out I left that group too. One thing that I need to mention, because it was what hurt me the most of what was said to that shout out, is the fact that I only had one boyfriend in my entire life, and we had not made love even though we were 8 months together, and it’s something that they used against me in that shout out. After that, I still haven’t had another boyfriend, and it’s my choice, because I haven’t found someone who I like that much. But now I think that too is my fault. 

After that, I made some new friends, but I keep all of them at a certain distance. One friend only I allowed to get a little bit closer: Lina. Has it ever happened that when you meet someone you just click and it's like you know each other for decades? That's what happened with her. We live and study in different cities but we are, or at least were, very close. 

The only thing that I can accuse Lina of, is that she does not plan anything and she may say something but does the exact opposite, in the sense that she is going to tell you that she will come at an important event and then one hour before she is going to send you a message and say ""I'm sorry I got held up, can’t come"". We have canceled two trips because of that. And I was really annoyed by that, at the point that I didn't talk to her for about a week. 

The problem now is that I'm not on the best state psychologically for the last couple of months. Last time we met up, it was with a group of other friends. We were talking about doing something all of us together, before I left (I was working so I had to leave earlier than the rest of them). But then, they didn't have the mood to do it while I was there. Then, the next day, Lina told me that she would call me. But she didn't. She was out with the others doing what we had planned to do all of us together. 

Now, I'm not saying that they did it because they didn't like me. I really don't think that's the case. It's just that because of my poor psychology I just clogged up. The day after, Lina tried calling me but I hung up, because I was at work. And I sent her that in a text message. She started sending me messages but I didn't respond or when I did I was very cold towards her (I was really in a difficult state). I don't know what snapped. I really don't. But the problem is not only with Lina. Other friends too sent me messages or called me but I just didn't pick up or left them on unread or even unopened. 

It came to a point that I just deleted the apps of any social media in which I knew they could find me. It's been three months. I don't know how long this will last. But at the moment, I really don't want to talk to anyone. Even my family and my coworkers, if I had it my way, I would not be speaking even to them. 
              
These three months, I have thought about a lot. There is no way that for all my friendships on all these 24 years I've lived, always the others are at fault. There must be something very wrong with me... Something that drives people away... I have a lot of bad sides, I'm the first one to admit that…But by the time I got in college, I was able to shut up these bad sides at least in regards to my friendships… Or so I thought… Or I don’t know… 

On one hand I feel so absolutely, terribly alone. On the other I just so not care about the others, I just want to be myself and myself alone. I really have no idea about what to do. At the time, I’m somewhat better, but I still don’t want to talk to anyone. For Lina, she hasn’t tried to contact me at all, she hasn’t called me. When I feel ready, I will send her a sorry message about my rudeness towards her, because I really feel bad about it. But, I can’t help but think… If she really was feeling as close to me as I to her, wouldn’t she have called me, at a time that I was not working (she knew my schedule, allegedly) to ask me straight, if something was wrong or if she had done something? We “met” at a conference a few weeks ago, but she did not come up to me. For me she did not do something wrong, but some other people I have talked, have said that if she was my friend, she should have come up and ask me face to face about what my problem is. I did not go to her, because I was too ashamed to face her… 

Lina is the totally opposite of me: more extroverted than extroverted. Also, I have to mention that in the conference she came and was always together with a “friend” of hers that she was always bitching about to me… So, there is also that… I really don’t know what to think or do… 

Visiting a psychologist is nearly impossible at this time. I don't know why I wrote this post, or what am I even expecting out of this... I just know that I'm tired of always prioritising other people, when I'm not anyone else's priority.

I’m 29, but I feel much older. Life with James has a way of aging me, of wearing me down like the tide erodes a cliffside—slowly, steadily, until all that’s left is fragile and crumbling. We’ve been married for six years. We have a daughter, Emily. She’s five and full of life, and sometimes I wonder if I even deserve her.

It wasn’t always like this. When we first met, James was attentive, kind. We would laugh about the smallest things. Our connection felt easy, natural. I thought we’d be one of those couples who could weather anything because we had each other. But somewhere along the way, that “each other” got lost. The laughter faded, the conversations shortened, and what’s left now is this hollow silence.

It’s the small things that weigh the most—the way James leaves his phone face down on the table or how he barely looks up when I walk into the room. His ""I love you"" at night feels rehearsed, more obligation than meaning. I can’t even remember the last time we truly looked at each other, really saw each other. I sometimes wonder if he remembers the color of my eyes, the sound of my laugh, or if he’s already forgotten the parts of me that once drew him in.

We keep up appearances, for Emily’s sake. We play the roles of husband and wife in public, and in front of friends, we’re the perfect couple. But behind closed doors, we are strangers. At night, after Emily is asleep, there’s a thick, suffocating silence between us. I’ll lie in bed, wide awake, staring at the ceiling while he sleeps with his back turned to me. It’s almost like the silence has become its own presence in our home, an unwelcome guest that won’t leave.

Tonight, it feels heavier than usual. We sit at the kitchen table, the space between us wide enough to hold all the words we no longer say, all the emotions we’ve buried. I swirl my spoon in my coffee, more for something to do than out of any real interest.

The question slips out before I can stop it. “Are you happy?”

I don’t know why I ask. Maybe part of me already knows the answer. Maybe part of me just needs to hear him say it.

He pauses, his fork halfway to his mouth, then slowly sets it down. He looks at me, really looks at me, and for the first time in weeks, I see something in his eyes that isn’t exhaustion or apathy. But it’s not love either. It’s confusion. It’s defeat.

“I don’t know,” he finally says. His voice is rough, like he’s admitting something he’s never said aloud before.

I nod, swallowing the lump in my throat. His answer hurts, but the truth is, I don’t know either. I want to tell him how much I miss us, how much I miss feeling connected, feeling seen. I want to scream that I’m still here, waiting for him to turn around, to come back to me. But the words don’t come. They never do.

From Emily’s room, I hear her soft giggle. She’s playing with her toys, unaware of the tension in the air. She’s the reason we’re still here, trying to piece together something that feels like it’s already shattered. We hold on for her, not for us. I think we both know it.

James looks away first, his eyes falling to his plate, and I can feel the moment slip away. Whatever chance we had to talk, to break this silence, it’s gone again. He goes back to eating, and I sit there, staring at my untouched cup of coffee.

I know this can’t go on forever. We can’t live in this silence, pretending everything is fine when it’s not. But for now, we do. For Emily, we do. I just don’t know how much longer we can keep pretending. How long before the silence finally consumes us.

Apologies if this has come up here before - I don't mean to ruffle feathers - but why Starbucks? Their reputation as a company isn't great and their coffee is very expensive and considerably subpar (I've probably had between 150-200 cups of it in my life mainly because it was the only option around).

As someone who only worked as a barista for a few months it always confused me why people fork up the cash for this stuff. 

What makes you go to Starbucks? There's so many subs here on how to (fairly easily and cheaply) make better and more responsible coffee at home and in the past 5-10 years a lot of local shops (USA) have come in with similar pricing and far superior coffee.

Is it your names on the cups? The convenience? The familiarity and guarantee of a consistent experience? Location? Or a magic blend of all of the above?

I'm just curious and would love to hear anyone's thoughts. 

Also, having worked in a basic cafe' (we just did the classic cap/latte/cortado etc. with some flavorings) I feel for you baristas who get those paragraph-long orders during rush hours.

I currently have a baratza encore grinder for my regular hario v60 pour over set up. I am starting to think I am going to need to replace that for something that makes finer grounds. Additionally I have been looking at espresso machines around the $500 dollar mark every day for 4 days or so now. It seems the gaggia pro classic is the best bet for a $500 budget. But after watching several videos including the James Hoffman best options under £500, the Rancilio Silvia is starting to speak to me. Partially because of its potential to make better. You can mod it more than many other machines in the under $1000 range. The problem is its not close to $500 anymore (if it ever was). I am wondering if I should just be patient and expand my budget to purchase the Rancilio Silvia and a new grinder, or start off with something cheaper? I love coffee and I love buying espresso drinks, so I know whatever I buy,  I’m going to keep using this machine for a long time. The follow on question is that if I’m going to spend $900 on the Rancilio Silvia, does it make sense to hold out even longer and crack the “prosumer” market right above the $1000 range? Am I missing any other great machines better than the Silvia between $500-$1000? Any advice helps. ",1,1729022027.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

1g4gn57,https://www.reddit.com/r/PopularSupplements/comments/1g4gn57/from_selfconscious_smiles_to_genuine_grins_jennys/,From Self-Conscious Smiles to Genuine Grins: Jenny’s ProDentim Journey,"I never thought much about my smile until it became something I actively tried to hide. I’m Jenny, a 36-year-old school counselor living in Portland, Oregon, and for most of my life, I was that person always smiling in photos, laughing loudly at jokes, and flashing my teeth at every chance. But over the past few years, something started to change.

It began subtly—just a little discomfort here, a twinge of sensitivity there—but before I knew it, I found myself avoiding foods I loved, and even worse, I started holding back my smile. The first real gut-punch came during a family BBQ when my sister casually mentioned, “Hey, are your teeth getting yellower?” That hit me like a ton of bricks. I realized then how self-conscious I had become. Every time I brushed my teeth, I dreaded looking in the mirror, and despite my efforts—brushing twice daily, flossing, using mouthwash—nothing seemed to help. The sensitivity, the bad breath, the receding gums… It all felt overwhelming.

Like most of us do when faced with a problem, I turned to the internet for answers. One late night, as I scrolled through my feed, a glowing review for ProDentim popped up. I had never heard of it before, but the idea of a supplement that could improve my dental health sounded intriguing. I dug deeper, reading stories of people who had transformed their smiles and their confidence through probiotics. They weren’t just talking about fresher breath or fewer cavities; they were talking about a whole new relationship with their oral health.

The more I read, the more I felt like I had nothing to lose by giving it a shot. I’d tried everything else, so why not this? After a bit of hesitation, I ordered a bottle of ProDentim. 

When my package arrived, I wasn’t expecting any miracles. I took my first tablet one morning, right after my usual cup of coffee, and hoped for the best. The chewable tablet tasted surprisingly good, almost like a sweet treat, and I figured it couldn’t hurt to keep going.

[ProDentim](https://preview.redd.it/iwddgl9qvvud1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ee5c47fbc644711f8802f03f4cc4587c540f268)

After a couple of weeks, I started noticing little changes. It wasn’t like some overnight miracle, but my gums didn’t feel as inflamed, and the sharp pains I used to get from cold drinks started fading. My breath felt fresher, too. But the real moment of realization came when my partner, Mark, mentioned it out of the blue: “You’ve been smiling a lot more lately. What’s going on?” I hadn’t even noticed it myself, but he was right—I wasn’t hiding my smile anymore. I was starting to feel like myself again.

Then came the moment I’d been dreading for months: my dentist appointment. Every time I walked into that office, it felt like I was getting a report card, and lately, I had been failing. But this time, my dentist seemed genuinely surprised. “Jenny, your gums are looking much better, and I’m not seeing the same level of plaque buildup we’ve been dealing with.” I told him about ProDentim, and he wasn’t dismissive—he actually said that probiotics could be beneficial for oral health, although they weren’t something he commonly recommended.

Over the next few months, things only got better. My sensitivity to hot and cold drinks was practically gone, and my teeth looked cleaner and brighter. Even more, I felt like I had my confidence back. I wasn’t worried about bad breath or stained teeth when I spoke to people, and my old habit of covering my mouth when I laughed disappeared.

I found myself talking about ProDentim to anyone who would listen—friends, coworkers, even the parents of the kids I counseled. And, just like me, they were all skeptical at first. “A probiotic for teeth? That sounds too good to be true!” But when I shared my experience, some of them decided to give it a try, and soon enough, they were seeing the same kind of results.

One of my closest friends, Beth, who’s struggled with bad breath for years, told me that after using ProDentim for a month, she didn’t have to worry about it anymore. And my cousin Kyle, who had been avoiding the dentist for over a year, finally made an appointment after he saw how much my dental health had improved.

Now, I’m not saying ProDentim is some magical cure-all, but for me, it was a game-changer. It helped me regain control of my dental health when everything else seemed to fail. More than that, it gave me my confidence back, something I hadn’t realized was missing until I got it back.

So, if you’re like I was—frustrated with constant dental problems despite doing all the “right” things—maybe it’s time to try something different. **ProDentim might just be the solution you didn’t know you needed. After all, sometimes it’s the small, unexpected changes that end up making the biggest difference:** [**https://prodentim.com/**](https://freezegluco.com/ProDentim.html)",1,1729021809.0,PopularSupplements,0,1.0,False

Many years ago I was headhunted by a local company for a senior IT role.  I agreed to meet the CEO for a coffee in a hotel lobby and spent about 2 hrs discussing my past and the company's needs.  All was going well.  At some point I thought I detected an odd vibe but by the end of the meeting I was sure that was just me being nervous.

There was some urgency to filling this post and I was asked to take a tour of their office building the next day, so I could get a better feel for what I'd be taking on.  I agreed.

That night I thoroughly examined the web site for the company and printed a few pages which I thought may be useful, but I wasn't sure if I'd use/need. Those pages were in my pocket the next day when my ""tour"" was to begin.  

Well, this tour wasn't a tour at all.  It was a formal interview with a very serious looking quorum of the board of directors.  To say I felt ambushed is putting it mildly.  The CEO had promised a tour but instead I find myself sitting on the lonely side of a big walnut table, mostly unprepared.

I answer a few questions and start to formulate my plan of action.  There is no way I'm ever going to work for a company that lured me to interview under false pretexts so I've nothing to lose.

I steer the conversation to web site security and how important it is to be on top of threats.  I emphasise the roles and responsibilities of the governing structures, and people.  Then I pull out a couple of pages of their customer's very sensitive personal data which I'd obtained within a few mins the previous evening, proving how shit their security was.

The HR director and the Chair of the board leave the room with the CEO in tow.  There are some raised voices down the corridor but I can't hear what's being said.  After a few mins they return, minus the CEO.  I wrapped up the interview by wishing them all the best finding someone to take the job and left the pages in the middle of the big boardroom table.

I wanted to share something I've been working on that I think might help you. 

A few weeks ago, I was observing my younger sister study for her exams. She had textbooks, notebooks, and sticky notes all over the place, trying to organize everything into a clear study guide. Sound familiar to anyone? 😅

That's when the idea hit me – what if we could use AI to make this process faster or maybe easier?

Fast forward a few sleepless nights of coding (and way too much coffee), and  [studyguidemaker.com](http://studyguidemaker.com) was born. 

Here's how it works: You upload your study materials, and the AI generates comprehensive study guides, including glossaries, quizzes, and flashcards.

I'd be incredibly grateful if you could give it a try and give me feedback on how to improve it.  What works? What doesn't? What features would make your study sessions even more productive?

The tool is free to use (you just need to create an account to log in – it helps prevent bots from draining my AI credits).

Checkout   the tool, and let me know what you think.

1g4gftb,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1g4gftb/my_decaf_journey/,My Decaf Journey,"This is an alt account to my regular account.  
So I started drinking caffeine in my late teens working at a grocery store and getting dunkin donuts iced coffee(back when it was semi good in the late 90's/early 2000's). It was sporadic. When to college and had coffee sometimes. Left college and got into EMS. Probably 2007/2008 is when I starting drinking caffeine every day and continued until quite recently.  Coffee is it for me. Not much for soda or energy drinks.   
  
Went to my doctor, said I have borderline high blood pressure. Besides some other stuff, caffeine was the first and easiest for my to cut.  I was drinking 300/400 to 600/800mg a day. Extra large/trente cold brew in the morning a must, and sometimes a second afternoon usually a large. I love the taste of coffee.  
  
So I go through phases of making my own cold brew, so started immediately with half-caff iced coffees. Did that for 2 weeks. I had no idea about the dreams thing until I had some wild dreams. After that, I'd cut my cold brew mixes to 2/3's decaf, then 3/4 decaf. I'm down to mostly decaf blends at home. Probably less than 50mg a day.  
  
Outcome, I feel great. I wake up feeling refreshing and not groggy. I'm not immediately craving coffee right when I wake up. Less headaches. Less ups and downs with energy which I didn't realize before. My goal isn't to go completely caffeine free.

Welcome to the wild world of economic mayhem—where your coffee costs a wheelbarrow full of cash and even the dollar might lose its swagger! That's right, folks, we’re talking about the **Crack-Up Boom**. But don’t panic just yet—because in a world where paper money might become nothing more than wallpaper, there's a hero in the wings. No capes, just code—**the Bitcoin Payment Button**! 🦸‍♂️💻

You heard that right! In a world where fiat currencies are dancing dangerously close to the edge, you need a backup plan. Enter Bitcoin, the digital escape hatch to financial freedom. And what better way to prepare yourself than by installing the **Bitcoin Payment Button** on your site? Let’s dive into the economic storm, how you can ride the chaos, and why this tiny button might just be your lifeboat! 🚤💸

# What Exactly Is the Crack-Up Boom?

Imagine a world where governments print money like there’s no tomorrow—oh wait, we don’t need to imagine. We’re already living it! 🌍💸 The term ""Crack-Up Boom"" refers to the final, frenzied stage of an inflationary spiral where people lose faith in their currency. Everyone’s trying to spend their cash as fast as possible, before it becomes worthless. It's like musical chairs, but instead of losing your seat, you lose your life savings. 💰🎶

In simple terms, it’s what happens when inflation goes from annoying to outright terrifying. Prices skyrocket, and people panic-buy everything from canned beans to Lambo NFTs. Economists describe it as a ""flight from money""—but to you and me, it’s ""don’t get caught holding the bag!""

When the dust settles, those who are ready for this economic apocalypse will still be standing tall. And guess what? With the **Bitcoin Payment Button**, you can be one of those savvy survivors!

# Why Bitcoin Is Your Crack-Up Boom Superpower

Now, why Bitcoin? Isn’t Bitcoin a volatile asset that goes up and down faster than your emotions during a horror movie marathon? Sure, it’s had its dramatic moments, but in times of serious inflation, **Bitcoin** tends to shine. Why? Because while central banks are busy making confetti out of your local currency, Bitcoin remains outside of their reach. No printing press, no funny money—just 21 million Bitcoins, ever. 🎯

It’s like gold, but digital and way cooler. And unlike fiat currencies, Bitcoin can’t be devalued at the whim of politicians or central banks. So, when everything else is losing value faster than last year's meme stock, Bitcoin is standing strong. And if you’re accepting payments through Bitcoin, you’re ahead of the curve—ready to ride out the storm. 🌪️💪

# The Bitcoin Payment Button: Your Gateway to Financial Freedom

This is where the **Bitcoin Payment Button** comes in. Want to keep your business afloat while the economy looks like it’s auditioning for a disaster movie? Install this beauty on your website, and you’re set to receive payments in Bitcoin.

It’s like planting a flag that says, ""I’m ready for the future!"" 🌱🏴‍☠️ In a world where people are fleeing fiat currencies, your website becomes a safe haven where they can pay in Bitcoin, and you can keep your value intact.

Imagine: While others are scrambling to figure out why their dollar buys less and less each day, you’re sitting back, sipping coffee, and receiving payments in the hardest money known to humankind. 🚀☕

# How Does It Work?

Let’s break it down:

1. **Super Simple Setup**: Adding the **Bitcoin Payment Button** to your website is as easy as pie. 🍰 You don’t need a PhD in computer science or a magic wand. Just visit [this link](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/payment-button/), follow the instructions, and boom—your button is live! 💻🔧
2. **Receive Payments Globally**: Bitcoin knows no borders. Whether your customer is in Brooklyn or Bangladesh, they can send you Bitcoin with just a few clicks. 🌎📲 No more worrying about currency conversions, bank fees, or getting lost in financial red tape.
3. **Instant Transactions**: No more waiting days for bank transfers. Bitcoin payments are processed faster than your morning coffee order. ⚡☕
4. **Low Fees**: Traditional payment processors love to nibble away at your earnings with fees. But with Bitcoin, you’re not feeding a middleman. The transaction costs are low, and you keep more of your hard-earned profits! 💵🐉
5. **Future-Proof Your Business**: The Crack-Up Boom might not happen tomorrow, but when it does, you’ll be ready. Accepting Bitcoin payments means you’re already aligned with the future of finance, long before the masses catch on. 🌱🧠

# Why You Should Care About Being Ready

Let’s be real for a second. Most people don’t think twice about their money until it’s too late. They’ll cling to fiat, thinking it’s ""safe"" while inflation quietly steals their purchasing power. Meanwhile, those in the know—like you—are preparing for what’s next.

By offering Bitcoin as a payment option, you’re not just safeguarding your wealth, you're giving your customers a lifeline, too. In a world where trust in fiat money is evaporating faster than rain in the Sahara, people are going to be looking for alternatives. Be the business that offers that alternative. 🌊🏄‍♂️

# Bitcoin: Not Just for the Big Players

You don’t have to be some Fortune 500 CEO to hop on this train. Whether you're running a small online shop or a blog with a loyal following, the **Bitcoin Payment Button** is your ticket to joining the crypto revolution. 💸🛍️

Think of it like this: The Crack-Up Boom is coming. It’s not a matter of if, but when. You can either sit around hoping it doesn't happen, or you can take action now, accepting Bitcoin and safeguarding your financial future.

# Conclusion: Don’t Get Caught Unprepared!

When the Crack-Up Boom hits, those who are prepared will be the ones thriving, while everyone else is still trying to figure out how to survive. By embracing Bitcoin and adding the **Bitcoin Payment Button** to your site, you're ensuring that you and your business are part of the solution, not the problem.

So why wait? Prepare yourself, your business, and your financial future by adding the **Bitcoin Payment Button** today. Visit [this link](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/payment-button/) to get started. You’ll thank yourself when the world starts spinning and you’re standing firm with Bitcoin in hand. 🌍🚀 #Boom",1,1729020771.0,BitcoinQR,0,1.0,False

To start off, I have a background in Supply Chain Management, and an MBA that is in Supply chain and Finance. I have over three years of work experience working at large 3PLs, and manufacturing purchasing positions. My last job I worked at a manufacturing firm that wasn't a great fit for me. It was incredibly toxic and management was largely devoid of training new hires. There was an expectation that you needed to know everything to be successful at the job. Lo and behold, I only lasted less than three months. Which is a shame as if given more time, I would've really excelled at what I was doing. The learning curve was enormous.

When It came to supply chain positions I interviewed at over 25+ different companies for purchasing, buying, and logistics firms. I was even flown out for an in person interview only to be rejected. I polished my interview skills, resume, dressed the part, and practiced as hard as I could in my presentation skills.

After my last job in purchasing, combined with all the interviews I was doing in the academic year, I decided to quit on supply chain altogether. I thought outside the box and decided to try for my real estate license and work for an industrial real estate brokerage (CBRE, JLL, MM).

This industry makes sense as my Grandfather is one of the largest producers of industrial properties in my state and has large connections that I have been using. In addition, I have been aggressively networking and meeting with people for coffee chats to discuss how they got started in the industry. I am also getting my RE license in a week (it's required to have anyways), but nonetheless I am always thankful, humble, and would really be willing to take the lowest paying job if it meant future success later on.

**TLDR: I guess my question is, despite all the rambling of my back story, what is the best path way forward towards doing a new career especially being a 26M? What other techniques of expanding my network do you recommend? I am really dead set on Real Estate and even if it doesn't work out, the sales skills gained could lead to a position such a BDR, SDR or even a sales manager rep.

I don’t know why, but i had a strange feeling of wanting to smoke and to drink a coffee (which i also try to quit)
but i believe it wasn’t a physical craving, but mental.

I burn out at my work, I also study at university (evening lessons) at a computer science specialty. I study because it is one way to avoid a mandatory military service in my country.

I used to have a ritual of smoking and drinking coffee. 
I was doing it for years, just to get through stress, to reward myself, to pass the time.

I also think that my lifestyle is adjusted for smoking and drinking coffee: I live alone, don’t go out, work online.
My unconscious mind has learned to smoke to fill the boredom, or reward myself whenever i complete a task, or enjoy a music etc.

Those smoke free days for sure were really beneficial, I didn’t get interrupted by smoking every 20-30 minutes (each smoke breaks would take 5-10 minutes) hence i was more efficient at my work. I was more energetic and present, My sleep has improved, I started to wake up really early.

I have learned so much from this sub, from stories of people, Allen Carr’s book helped a lot too, as well as whyquit.com. 
I am very thankful to all of you guys <3

I am going to quit again, after an event on Friday, when i will drink a little with friends) After that the quit counter will reset for smoking, drinking alcohol and coffee.

I'll try to keep this as short as I can and to the point, but it will be long, and chances are I'll ramble and for that I apologise.

Honestly, I don't know what I expect to gain from this. I hope putting my thoughts and feelings onto electronic paper will allow me to better move on, to get it out of my body and into the ethereal void. To find some form of closure on what has been a soul shattering, heart wrenching experience.

  
Back in 2011 / 2012, I met this girl, hereon referred to as Aino. I was never a big believer of love at first sight, but I was immediately smitten. She was beautiful, funny and kind. We had common interests but a fair few differences to keep things interesting. The catch to all this though was that she was taken, so I accepted that it would only ever be a friendship.

Aino had a very tough start to life. She was relentlessly bullied in school. Her home life wasn't particularly the greatest and her friendships truly embodied the saying ""With friends like these, who needs enemies"".

At the time she was dating a boy named Abaddon, who was her older by a few years. Abaddon was abusive, not physically, but mentally, emotionally and financially. He openly cheated on Aino and belittled her in front of both friends and strangers alike. It was a toxic relationship that Aino, with all her trauma and experiences up to that point felt she deserved.

Until about a year later, she had enough. They separated and she moved on, for a time. With her newfound freedom and single status, she, in retrospect, turned to self-destructive activities. As she had barely passed the age of 18, she turned to copious amounts of alcohol and a fair few one-night stands, among other things a younger head may think is a good idea.

Around this time, I found out that the attraction between us was mutual. We hugged and kissed but that's as far as it ever got. We later spoke about this period and where I wanted something more than basic carnal release, she stated that she felt she was worthless, and deserved nothing better than being treated poorly, by people like Abaddon, so we didn't take it any further.

A fair few more months pass by, along with a few more exes, and suddenly, she and Abaddon have gotten back together. Promises of having changed and maturing over the two or so years they had been apart. Though within several weeks dating again, she fell pregnant. The promises were unshockingly lies and the abuse, though again not physical, became even worse than before. She was isolated from friends and family and slowly reclused herself away from the usual crowd of people.

During this time, I had moved out from my hometown to another family members home, to pursue a career. I didn't hold much contact with the old group of mutual friends Aino, and I had shared, and she continued to feel trapped in a toxic, abusive relationship. Whilst she was in labour, Abaddon continued to neglect her. Despite working two jobs and pretending to be anything other than what he was, he spent his money on Games, Collectibles, Tattoo's, Drink and Drugs.

Aino suffered from medical complications during both the labour and the birth. One of her ""friends"" decided that telling her Abaddon was seen spending money on getting himself, and a girl he was cheating on Aino with, a tattoo together was a good idea, which only worsened her state.

Eventually, she gave birth to two twin children who had their own complications. Aino decided to stay in the relationship out of fear of being a single mother and a continued belief that she deserved this. They continued dating for a while before she came to the realisation that Abaddon was never going to change, and that in reality, she was already a single mother.

After moving back in with family, she contacted me through messenger. She was sad we had fallen out of contact and would love to catch up over a coffee. I still traveled back to my hometown frequently to meet family and a few friends who had not yet moved themselves, so agreed.

When I reconnected with Aino, she still looked stunning. We spoke as if though we had only seen each other the day before and all those feelings came rushing back. Everything was so natural and the transition from friends to something more was so seemless, that instead of asking each other out we had to pick a date we believed was our anniversary.

Our relationship was bliss. To sum my feelings up as best as I can: There is a suggested theory that the night sky is dark due to the universe being ever expanding and not infinite, for if it was infinite, the sky would be littered with stars. Her presence alone made me doubt such a theory, for she was the brightest, most brilliant person I had ever met. Even in the darkness of night, she truly lit up my life.

Four to five years later we are still going strong. Though there were a few ups and downs, for my part; like the thought of whether I was truly ready at such a young age to take on the responsibility of two twin children with their own complexities, or if I could handle Abaddon being a constant part of my life whilst he denied child support, consistently introduced new people and partners to the children, neglected them whilst they were visiting and then after a time stopped seeing them all together.

Despite this, we still loved each other, we were both open and communicated any issues. We discussed marriage, possible more children, finances and goals. And in that time, she had become even more amazing. I pushed, supported and challenged her to be better, to be more confident, to have ambition and dreams, and to ensure when all is said and done, she would always be able to support herself and her children. She completed her degree, receiving a first. She became more confident, no longer allowing friends and family to undermine her as a mother, or as a person. We had gone on trips and adventures, at home and abroad and the love I first felt for her paled in comparison to my feelings at that time.

We both felt we were ready for the next step. Over the past few years my career had taken off and I had used the advantage of living with family to save a great deal of money for us to get our own place.

We moved to a small village, an hour drive away from both our families. We rented a three-bedroom house to ensure that we would still thrive living together before committing to an owned property. We lived well together. We shared a proportionate amount of household chores, and I did my best to take on the responsibilities of a stepfather whilst treading a fine line to ensure I still gave Aino the overall authority as the mother.

When we first moved, I had the advantage of working from home, so when we arrived, I was solely financially responsible for a four-person, three-bedroom household. Bills, utilities, clothes, food, luxuries, outside expenses and more. I was also the only person who could drive.

I had encouraged Aino to find some part time work, so that we could continue to save and still live a comfortable life whilst renting. I ensured her we would reevaluate the household chores, that outside of some savings her money was her own, that I knew what it was like to work and feel you get nothing out of it. However, as time went on Aino become more and more complacent. No money went into savings. She was more distant. She stopped communicating. Physical touch such as hugs and kisses dwindled and ""I love you""'s turned into ""See you later"" as she left for work or hung up the phone.

I had begun to feel isolated. I was far from family. I pushed out close friends due to what I later learned was feelings stemming from clinical loneliness. Bills and utilities became a lot more expensive due to the price catching up from the pandemic. I was still solely financially responsible for the house after two years and I felt as if though I was drowning in stress and depression.

After a while, partly due to the low funding of public services, partly due to the after-effects of the pandemic, the bus timetable changed. Aino could get to work for early shifts but could no longer get back. Late night shifts were written off entirely. Despite working from home, I was still working and unable to make the solid commitment that I could pick her up.

Aino had to leave her job. We sat down and spoke about what to do going forward. Living in a village, with no public transport meant it was impossible to get around without a car, and I couldn't be reliable on that point with my own job commitments. Cycling was dangerous, the cost of a taxi invalidated any money made from working in the first place.

The conclusion? There were two options: Either Aino learnt how to drive, and we spent some of the savings we still had on a car, and insurance. Or we speak to family and move back in whilst I save, and she can get started on learning how to drive and the start of a potential career with less time pressure.

We attempted to do the first option. Myself, my mother and my aunt all contributed about £1k each. Aino's mother who had recently sold her old house, also used some of the money to contribute £1k. With a total of £4k, we encouraged Aino to learn how to drive. Though not my go to recommendation, crash-course lessons were the best option given our circumstances.

Aino flew through the theory test, passing it first time. The actual driving was more of a struggle. Her insturctor, bozo, despite being told of the circumstances decided to go on holiday midway through the crash course completely negating any of the first several hours Aino had taken. By the time he came back he continued to put Aino on the back burner, week to two-week hiatuses between driving at a time.

Whilst this was ongoing, I had made clear to Aino that financially, I was struggling. If the car didn't work out, we would be forced to go with option two. we were also chasing up Abaddon to pay his financial responsibilities for his children. We were forced to go through a government service and had to wait a year. Finally, everything went through. and despite being solely, financially responsible for the household; not just for myself, but Aino and the children as well - she then proceeded to put the money into personal savings.

I was left feeling used, taken for granted and unconsidered.

By no means am I perfect. I am not without fault during the collapse of our relationship. As Aino became more distant, I too had reacted in kind. Though Aino did not communicate, I struggled to as well. Aino had come from an abusive relationship, and traumatic past. I loved her, wanted the best for her, and pushed for her to be the best she could be, but as a result I would also tiptoe on eggshells to ensure I did not upset her. This habit carried over into the later years of our relationship, despite the progress and developments she made.

I started to pick apart the structure of our relationship. I realised that what I thought we had, maybe we didn't.

I had to talk to her about what had happened with the money. So, I did. I picked her up from the local town and as we were on the way to pick up the children from school, I brought it up. Despite communicating how I felt, I still didn't say all I wanted to say. I still didn't want to upset her, and I insisted she keep the money all the same.

Eventually, the time had come. Aino was not in a state where she could pass her driving test. Summer holidays had started, and we had to make the decision to move back in with our respective families before the start of the next school year or risk renting an additional year during uncertain financial times.

We started preparing to move out. I would have to stay for a few extra months until the end of the lease, but Aino could move with the children prior to the start of the new school year.

The last year of our relationship was torturous. I was truly made to feel as if though I was the lowest priority. A few stand-out situations:

During the time between where Aino had moved back with family, but prior to me moving back with mine; I had suggested that we get the children up to the rented house every other week whilst we still had it. That this would help transition them from home to home as opposed to instantaneously and permanently moving. That this would help them whilst they were already undergoing issues around abandonment and instability. I had pointed out that chances are, there would be food items with her that the children would eat. Nuggets, chips, beans, that sort of thing. I had asked that she bring these food items up with her, as I was still solely paying for the household and bills, and if I needed to do a food shop, it would only be for things we need, and not a whole one for the sake of a few days.

Honestly, I can't remember her exact response, but to paraphrase she didn't want to take the mick out of her mother and stepfather who she was living with at the time. Again, I felt hurt, because to me it insinuated that she was happy to do so with me. In no way am I entitled to the food items that were there. Maybe I was overly sensitive, and maybe you could make the argument that they're her family so of course they'll be a higher priority than her partner, but I felt hurt. But,

During our relationship, Aino had made a friend in Tristesse. Tristesse was the partner of my friend. They had split up a few years ago but Aino and her connected so well that they remained in contact and are best friends to this day.

Tristesse lives about two hours away from Aino and had arranged a surprise birthday party for her partner, Gisil. They like that sort of stuff. I had moved back with my own family by this point, and I had agreed to drive an hour down to Aino, pick her up, and then drive a further two hours to Tristesse. Later, I find that Aino has agreed, and committed our time to go down early to help with prep and decorations, without communicating with me. Once again making me feel used and unconsidered. Despite this I agree.

I get up early, pick Aino up, travel down to Tristesse's house, and there is about 20 - 30 people there. I know three of them. Tristesse, who is hosting 20 - 30 people and swept off her feet, Gisil, who is the man of the hour and not even there yet, and Aino, who immediately ditched me to go hang out with her new friends she'd made through Tristesse. In the early days of our relationship, when we used to go out to pubs and social events, I am by nature a social butterfly. I have friends from different groups, and I normally like to interweave my way through these groups and have fun. If I was ever with Aino, I would always stick with her. I would never want her to feel alone, forgotten or abandoned. Once again, I felt unconsidered.

After several hours, it was time to head home. Driving back to mine, to drop Aino off to her home the following day I had mentioned that my own birthday was coming up. I mentioned that my Birthday falls in a period where I'll be alone for two weeks as my family are heading away for a road trip. I followed-up by saying that I didn't need an extravagant party, a gift, or even a card. What was important to me is that I got to spend time with my partner on or near my birthday. She worked every other weekend, so we found a date for the weekend prior to my Birthday, and that was penned in. All was fine, until it wasn't.

One day, she phones me and tells me that she was unable to get her friendship tattoo with Tristesse in a major city due to train cancellations. That they had to reschedule the tattoo for another day. The day she was meant to come up to see me for my Birthday.

I don't know if she chose this day deliberately, or if she had forgotten. But what was made abundantly clear was she didn't care either way. She made a loose promise of coming up to see me two or three weeks later, but the damage was done. Not only did she put more effort into her friends, partners birthday over her own partners, but in prioritising getting a tattoo over spending time with me, on my Birthday, to leave me alone, neglected and forgotten, she had begun to treat me in the same way Abaddon had treated her. A thought that I had not made lightly. Her friendship with Tristesse was beginning to feel as if though it bordered on emotional infidelity.

I felt I had to get over myself. I had to say something, because, if I didn't; this could be the beginning of the end of our relationship. I gave myself a few hours to cool down before phoning Aino and I had asked if everything was okay? I was concerned in her behaviour towards me not just recently, but over the past while.

Though my intention was to bring up the treatment of the past number of months, her response threw me for a loop. She didn't want any more children. She had known this fact for 10 or so months now. I wasn't too focused that she didn't want any more children, I wasn't even sure myself, but what hit me was the fact she knew for as long as she did, and didn't feel comfortable communicating with me. She made a massive decision - without communicating - that affected both of us in the relationship and Aino further acknowledged that whilst she knew this fact, she had let it affect the way she was treating me.

I said I had to consider what she said, and that I'd get back to her when I've had enough time to think. But the truth was, I knew what had to happen the second I put the phone down. Any future kids, or lack thereof wasn't the problem, it was the pile of issues, both which have and have not been said. This is the last straw that broke the camel’s back for me.

One problem. We have a holiday booked. Abroad. Aino, me, the children and some of my family. The money isn't an issue. It'd suck, but it is what it is. Truthfully I felt horrible for Aino's kids. They had several issues (which I'm not getting into more than necessary), and after recently moving both home and school, I felt a week away, playing with friends and relaxing would really help them settle, even slightly.

I was unsure. Do I wait until after the holiday? Or do I do it before? I got advice from some of my closest family. I decided not to go with their advice. One of my main issues was the lack of communication, I would be a hypocrite if I then withheld my feelings for the sake of convenience.

Seven years our relationship had lasted. Thirteen years we had known each other. I felt I owed it to Aino to have the conversation face-to-face. I met her at her house. I sat down and spoke with her. Once again, what I feel is my kindness, or cowardice depending on your perspective, prevented me from saying my true feelings. I said that I'm still not sure if I want kids, but on the possibility I might, it would be unfair to both her, and I to continue this relationship.

I did say I regretted the fact she did not communicate with me. That had she done so we could've both discussed it properly. But after so long, after making her decision, that if we were to stay together and she changed her mind again, or I had decided I too, didn't want kids - that even if we genuinely felt that way, we would always doubt if that was our decision and not one we made just to stay together. It could lead to resentment and bitterness. It's not fair on the kids to bring them up in that sort of environment.

There were tears on both sides. Despite how I was treated, I still loved her. I like to think, for what it's worth Aino still loved me as well. I told her that the holiday was still open to her, that I'd love for her and the kids to come, but I would understand if she wasn't comfortable. I had said the only person who was going on Holiday that would know is my mother, who can keep confidence.

We also discussed tied up assets. We had a lockup from when we lived together with both of our stuff. About £200 or so a month. I asked that she continue to only contribute £50 so long as her stuff remains there.

I didn't want to see her, or the children in the lurch so I also offered £8000 from my savings, which was well over half of what I had at the time. To help her with a car, or a down payment. Anything she needed it for.

We ordered some food, ironed out some details, reminisced about the good times and then I left. Aino was going to tell her mother and stepdad we had separated the following morning but looking into the window of their home I saw her crying and in her mums’ arms. I didn't hold up much better on my drive home.

After that, we only saw each other or spoke on a handful of occasions.

Aino did come along on the holiday. We spoke a lot, about how it'd be great to stay friends, how if after a while things may change again and we could try again. The kids had a lot of fun. We did too, or so I felt we did.

After we got back, she called me a couple of times, and I called her. I was truly elated we could at least keep a friendship. We didn't want to tell the kids we had separated, or what that meant for them until after we got back. I had been in their life for seven years. I had provided for them, spent time with them. Helped them with homework, stepped up and disciplined them where necessary. I didn't just want closure for myself, but for them as well.

Aino tried to push me out of the conversation. She wanted to have it whilst around and supported by Tristesse and Gisil. She didn't want me there. I said they're her kids, and I'd understand, but pointed out what I said above. Truly though, I felt it was disrespectful and short-sighted. Not just to me, but the kids as well.

I then sent her the £8000 I promised. She then stopped talking to me. She stopped phoning me and when I would phone her to maybe meet up, she would throw out a flimsy excuse to avoid doing so.

Then finally, she asked when she could get her stuff from the lock up, probably expecting me to drive it all down. Like I've said, I'm not perfect. I was feeling hurt and spiteful. After spending years supporting her, her children. To be there for her financially, mentally, emotionally, physically and in not my proudest moment I told her she could arrange a date to come up and get it herself.

Aino got back to me with a date. A Saturday. I confirmed that date with her and we waited.

Since moving back with my family, I feel like a new person. I acknowledged my feelings, and why I felt the way I did. I wanted to improve myself. I joined the gym, fixed my sleeping pattern, reconnected with the old friends I had originally pushed away. I travelled into the local city for meet-up events and board games to make new pals and found a fantastic group of new friends. Social situations now, for the most part feel like a doddle. My hair used to be thinning. Not balding or anything but you could see the scalp if I didn't style it right, so I even shaved that all off. I cannot express the joy of being able to go into your bathroom and not experience what appears to be the aftermath of a brutalised, shaggy, shedding dog every morning. Thankfully I have a beard, so I don't like a walking, talking thumb.

But the day came. I didn't know if I could bare to see Aino, so I arranged for my family to go down and open the lock up in my place. I thought she'd come with her stepdad or bio-dad. I arranged to go meet some of my new pals to take my mind away from her coming up. It didn't work.

She arrived with Ciaran. A person I feel I've met but can't be 100% sure. I'm not sure of their relationship, and truthfully, I don't care. 

I don't know how I feel about her actions. They feel calculated and a bit cut throat. Being pushed out of an important conversation in favour of some friends, to drop me after taking the money offered, after pretending we'd remain pals. To bring up some random guy which is tactless. The fact it was arranged weeks in advance also leads me to believe that she never considered how that'd look, or trying to inspire a bit of envy.

But truthfully, her recent visit has opened old wounds. I then noticed she had dropped me from all social media, which is of course her prerogative and despite what I logically know, despite what happened I struggle to separate the emotional side of myself. It this how 13 years end? Not with closure, but a whimper.

At the start of what I can only describe as my version of war and peace, I was unsure what to do. Do I let things die? Do I phone her one last time, to acknowledge that this is it, and we're too far gone to recover even a friendship but to at least gain closure? Do I write a letter? Explaining how I was made to feel?

Now, I am confident in what I must do. I miss her. I miss her companionship. I miss her scent, her touch. I miss the hugs. I miss who I thought she was, maybe even in fact who she was. I know there is nothing wrong with coming to terms with that. But that is not who she is now. That there is nothing embarassing about opening up, being vulnerable, and potentially even being wrong. I do not hate her. She has many endearing traits and wonderful qualities. I will always try to remember the good times we had together whilst not forgetting there was also the bad which helped cause this. We are too far gone, too much time has passed and with this open letter I hope I can put a close to this chapter of my life.

If you read all of this, thank you. Please be aware, this long wall of text is only just scratching the surface of a 13 year relationship. I am obviously biased to my own view, even when I have tried to be as fair and objective as possible. Lack of communication turned out to be a major issue in our relationship, so I can't be sure of how she may have viewed things. I'm also not going to try and decipher how she felt, as I'd be trying to understand the perspective of who I thought I knew, not who she seems to have turned out to be.

Edited for spelling and additional information.

Me (26M) and my ex (24F) broke up a little more than 3 months ago. We met her freshman year of college and my junior year, eventually we moved in together after i graduated with my masters while she was still going to school, so we lived together for a little under 3 years. 

She was the only girl that i have ever dated that i knew i wanted to spend my entire life with even from the start and even when there was bad moments (we never really had these, we never argued or yelled at each other, even at the very end, we were both very mature people, atleast that’s how it was.). We were also both very communicative i thought, until maybe towards the end. I had a pretty good relationship with her family and we had a cat together. From my understanding she broke up with me after falling out of love with me, those were her words when i gave her all i could. 

When we moved in i sacrificed a lot to be with her, i grew up almost 300 miles away and did not have any family or really many friends from college that were around in the area that we stayed in. We had just moved into a new apartment a month and a half before the breakup and she told me she started to feel like breaking up with me shortly after we moved in there. 

The thing that triggers me is she started working at a new job around this time as well, she met new friends from there and my sweet girl turned into someone that always wanted to go out with them. I have a career where i make an above average salary but have a large amount of student debt so work was important as i had bills to pay and i was not able to hang out with her and her new friends really ever because they wanted to hangout usually later at night when she knew i had to be up early in the morning. She also went back to school after completeing a degree as she did not want to do anything with it so she wanted to try something else out. I feel like she did not understand my work commitments as all she had to worry about was online school and her part time job at a restaurant, which i know is still a lot but we were just in two different places. She also during our entire time was not a drinker, or really even liked going to parties. I was the wild kid in college before i met her and she completely changed me for the better. Stopped taking drugs and drinking to blackout every night with my college teammates, my grades also improved enough to where i was able go to grad school. I was never really fawn of these new friends as some of the things she told me were a bit suspect and not really the type of people that she normally hangs out withbut i trusted her. I always gave her all my trust even when she would go out. I did catch her snap chatting a coworker that she had no interest in (he wasn’t her type) and i mentioned to her that i was really okay with it but i trust her. Later after the breakup i brought this up and she told me that he creeped her out and no longer works with her because she told him that, idk what happened there but it doesn’t feel right. Also two days before we broke up she said she was meeting with a guy friend for coffee after work, i said okay be safe and let me know when your are coming home. This sounds like cheating right?

I suspect there was cheating but she reaffirmed me many times that she didn’t and she did not want to be with anyone after us as she needs to fix herself. She knew she had “undiagnosed” OCD and she would often have moments where OCD would absolutely floor her, i almost did my best to comfort her during these times. I really just don’t know what happened and what i did. She would give me no other reason as to why we needed to end things. What upsets me is that probably only a month before this she told me that she would never break up with me and i would be the one breaking up with her.

Towards the end she got really mean to me. Always trying to start arguments and never giving me anything that would make me feel like she loved me. There was no intimacy the last month or so as well, but she was never an intimate person. For the last two years it was never enough personally for me and she knew that but i never complained because i know she was going through a lot, with undiagnosed mental issues. I just put up with everything because i cared for her like no one person ever in my life and it didn’t bother me enough to try and change her. I understood.

Back to the break up, she broke up with me on a random Thursday, oddly enough that morning i got in the shower for work and could just feel my intuition telling me this was happening today, i had never felt that the entire relationship. One thing i will say is that a month prior to the breakup as well i asked for a simple hug and she wouldn’t give it to me, i went on a walk and returned the apartment and told her how i had felt about how she was treating me and that way and she acknowledged it, not much changed obviously before it was over. If anything it only got worse.

After the breakup i stayed in the apartment we lived in for 2 months looking for jobs to move back home with my parents, we talked most days but it was hard and i feel like i made things worse as i was honestly so depressed. I was alone in an apartment doing nothing but working, applying for jobs, and sleeping. This was the worst 2 months of my entire life.

Eventually i was able to move home with a new higher paying job but the way things ended hurt even more. Two days before i left we had a talk where i wanted more closure, which i really didn’t get many answers aside from the whole i still love you, but i fell out of love with you, and i didn’t cheat on you, she also admitted that her parents were really upset with the break up. The night i was supposed to leave we agreed to say our goodbyes, she completely blew me off. Saying she couldn’t do it and she didn’t feel comfortable seeing me to say goodbye. That’s what hurt the most, i was ready to let go and respect her decision until she couldn’t even come face to face with me and say one last goodbye and goodluck.

 Moving home and starting my new job has been tough but I’m slowly adapting to things here. I was strong on no contact aside from the first week as rent was charged to my bank account do the apartment manager (yes the apartment is still partially in my name, i worked things out with her and her dad to pay my side and promised that if i need to step in to help just let me know) messing up the auto pay where i had to contact her, she was rude to me but nothing to terrible. 

Our five year anniversary would’ve been this past Sunday, i did text her the Friday before as something in my brain just finally caved in to check up on her, which went okay. Not much was shared and i just wanted to make sure her and the cat were okay. I did ask her about a thing on tv that we would watch together all the time where i got a very dry respond and just did not text back as it was not worth it anymore.

I’ve moved to blocking her on all social media as i would try and check in on things every few days (yes i know this is terrible, but doing this is going to help me move in the right direction.). This is more of a decision to help me get over things, i have no hate towards her.

Life is just really hard right now for me, i never thought i would be in this position as we had so many plans and i gave her genuine and as much unconditional love that i could possible give her. In the end, i think she just got bored with me as i was her first for everything. 

I really just don’t know what to do now, she’s all i can think about and i see her everywhere. She’s in my dreams that wake me up every morning at 4am and it’s really starting to take a toll on me, even though i genuinely think i am getting better. Just really slowly. I know i was not appreciated, even during the relationship but i just thought this was a down period for us, which i felt never really happened before.

Over the last month and a half that i have been back home i have been spending as much time as possible with friends and family, with the weather getting colder in the midwest it’s going to be a lot tougher to stay happy and busy the coming months. I’ve gotten back into some old hobbies, been treating myself, and trying to take better care of myself physically and mentally. I did lose almost 25 pounds during those two months that i was alone and i am a relatively scrawny guy as it is.

What advise do you have to give me? Is there any chance to get back together here? Would you even take her back if that was an option down the road? How badly did i mess up texting her the other day when i texted her with genuinely good intentions? What even happened her from my perspective? I know i need to just finally leave her alone which is the plan. But i just don’t know what i need to do to take the next step. I lost a lot here and all my plans and goals revolved around her and us, she also knew this i told her this multiple times as she was so worth all the sacrifices i made. This girl truly was one of the only things that made me happy in this life. It just sucks because the girl i fell in love with was a completely different person in the end.

The pay was okay, not too great but the company is small anyways. They had this corporate client doing breakfast and lunch. 

First day and all of the catering servers seem angry, including their lead. Was micromanaged constantly despite my experience and the people from the corporate client were dismissal, complaining even about the angle that we set up the plates and bowls. I only worked 2 days (my off days, I have a full-time job) and told myself I didn't like it and not go again. But since I have bills, I told myself I could work 7 days. 

I come here today, first thing the lead girl tells me that my hair isn't properly tied up, go to the restroom now. Then she continues with micromanagement, like I lack common sense. ""Pick up the tongue from the floor and change gloves immediately.""

Wasn't allowed to get any drip coffee or tea. Even the water bottles was too much for them. 

My start time was 7am and I have to wait at the gate for her to open it and she wrote down 7:05am. Then I went on my lunch break and she said there was no space around, how I should go and have lunch in the catering van. I was ok. Then she comes 10 mins later during my lunch interrupting me that she has to drive it and I can go to the other van that's 5 mins away and can't be sitting around the street. I come back from my lunch break and I said I have to use the restroom and she wrote down that I took a 45 minute lunch. She told me I can't go to the restroom while I am on the clock and told her that's illegal. 

Last week she sent me on a lunch break after the 5th hour and tried to refuse the penalty. I told her I was walking out because I didn't take such a long break and left.

I couldn’t afford to procrastinate or waste time in class by not paying attention. So, at the start of Grade 10, I decided to focus in class, make notes, and keep up with the lessons. However, since I hadn’t taken studies seriously before, especially in Grade 9, it was naturally a bit hard at first.

The problem was that, despite my efforts to concentrate, I would often get headaches, and it became really difficult to stay focused for long periods. I’d start daydreaming, then suddenly remember, “Oh wait, I’m in class!” and try to refocus, but the headaches were killing me. My sleep schedule wasn’t bad, and I was getting enough rest, but my screen time was questionable. Still, I couldn’t really reduce it, since all our textbooks and resources had moved online, and I needed the internet for studying.

I tried several things to help me stay focused in class. I’d bring coffee or tea to drink when the headaches came or when I felt tired, but nothing really worked. Eventually, I lost motivation and became a bit rebellious. Thankfully, I didn’t fail any classes by the end of Grade 10.

By the time Grade 11 started, I was already regretting how I’d wasted my time in the previous year and was determined to do better. But, in the end, it turned out just like Grade 10. When mocks came around, I was STRUGGLING to catch up and learn the syllabus. I did, however, make sure to take care of my sleep schedule, so I wouldn’t exhaust or stress my brain any more than it already was.

My IGCSE results weren’t the best, but nothing was below a C, and honestly, at that point, that’s all I could ask for. But I’ll never forget how bad those two years were, especially with the headaches. They could have been migraines, but I’m not sure.

Now, as I wait for the January intake to start A-Levels, I’ve decided to start studying early, so even if I lose motivation later, I won’t fall too far behind. But THESE  DAMN HEADACHES are stopping me from making any progress. Since the beginning of September, my headaches have felt much worse. My head feels hot, almost like it’s on fire, and it sometimes feels like my nerves are about to explode. I don’t know what to do to stop them.

Unfortunately, my parents don’t take it seriously and tend to ignore me when I tell them about the headaches. It doesn’t seem like a big deal to them, but I know how badly I’m struggling, and I need help overcoming this so I don’t end up like I did during IGCSE.

In short, the problem is that I’ve been struggling with severe headaches since Grade 10, which make it hard to stay focused in class or while studying. Despite having a good sleep schedule and trying different ways to improve concentration, the headaches persist and feel like my head is burning or about to explode. This affected my performance during IGCSE, and now, as I prepare for A-Levels, these headaches are still holding me back. My parents don't take the issue seriously, so I feel stuck and need help to overcome this before it affects my studies again.",1,1729019185.0,malaysiauni,0,1.0,False

I'm looking for recommendations for a coffee machine for our office, with a budget of around $750. Ideally, I want an automatic machine with a built-in bean grinder that can make coffee, espresso, cappuccino, etc. It should be intuitive and not require a lot of maintenance (since that will likely fall on me! 😅).

We’ll probably brew about 40-50 cups a week max, so nothing too intense—just something reliable and efficient. Bonus points if it can be connected to a water hook-up by the sink, but that's not a dealbreaker.

Here are a few options I’ve found so far:

* **De'Longhi Magnifica ESAM3300**
* **Gaggia Brera Super Automatic Espresso Machine**
* **Philips 3200 Series Fully Automatic Espresso Machine w/ LatteGo**

As though I it has always been this way and I have always disliked coffee. 5 months into HRT I start progesterone because I basically have PMS. Like constantly in the luteal phase and having a mental breakdown twice a day. So 2 days into starting progesterone, I make my friend coffee. It doesn't smell nauseating. I make myself coffee, it just tastes of coffee. I can finally enjoy coffee again. 

Then 2 months into starting progesterone, I find I am a week low on supply so I go a whole week with no progesterone. Coffee tastes like chemicals again. I get my progesterone back, coffee again tastes like coffee.

It's also changed my sexuality. PreHRT I was polysexual. I was bisexual with a strong preference for women. I was attracted to anyone who presented femme regardless of their gender so this also included femboys and just feminine men. 3 months into oestrogen, I'm still bisexual but it's looking more like a 50:50 split. I start progesterone, the longer I am on it, the more convinced I am pan. It's also changed how I feel attraction. It's less of a physical want and more connection focused.

Dear \[Agent Name\],

THE COMPANY SHE KEEPS is a stand-alone work of upmarket/women’s fiction complete at 100,000 words. It will appeal to readers who enjoyed the complicated gender dynamics, complex mother-daughter relationships, and voice-y protagonists of Rufi Thorpe’s *Margo’s Got Money Troubles* and Isabel Kaplan’s *NSFW*. 

When Mina’s nominated to a prestigious 30 Under 30 list, it should mean she’s finally shed her classist, anti-feminist upbringing for good. After all, success in the largely male events production space doesn’t come cheap or easy, but at least she didn’t marry into it to get hers.

She’s learned the hard way, though, that love and acceptance come with a cost, and she can’t afford to have the spotlight expose what others will see as faults again. Not if she wants to keep the boss she respects and admires, the co-workers that treat her like family, or the friends she loves the same. Still, at the risk of disappointing those same people—and maybe (definitely) to thumb her nose at her past—Mina accepts.

Forced to justify her acceptance for a PR profile, Mina filters her life experiences through tarnished lenses, believing everyone will see what she does. If she’s one of only two women on the list, she’s not good at her job, but a meritless token. If anyone else learns she’s slept with three of the men, she’s not sex-positive, but damaged goods. And if she mistakes hands reaching out in support for fingers pointing in her direction, she’s not the woman she’s worked so hard to become. Until she learns to value her whole self—and accept that those who *truly* love her already do—she can’t be.

I am a graduate of a women’s college, a twelve-year veteran of the music industry, and the current co-owner of a small tech firm. Voice-y female protagonists in largely male spaces are kinda my thing. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

  
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

**The Company She Keeps (First 300)**

My friend Mazzy says kinks are like opinions and assholes, in that everyone’s got their own and we all have the capacity to be one. Unlike the latter, though, which tend to hit you upside the head, kinks are stealthy. Kinks sneak up on you. They may very well still knock you flat on your ass, but you won’t necessarily see them coming. 

As I lay in bed, all but TKO’d by my latest assignment, I tried to pinpoint the exact moment in time my own kinks — many and varied as they were — had invited masochism into the ring.

The assholes.

“Did you hear that mess?” Jay asked, coming out of the bathroom, one of the bed-and-breakfast’s plush towels wrapped around his waist, another draped over his shoulder.

“Uh, do you *see* it?” 

His eyes roved over the briefing files that had taken over the bed. “Yeah,” he said, shaking his head before crossing to the beverage nook. “Yeah, I see it.” 

As he poured steaming coffee into two mugs, I shook my head, too. The supposedly highbrow newscast had faded to so much background noise as something something *fallen starlet* something something *I’m so sorry* something else traveled the airwaves. I’d paid just enough attention to learn no crime had been committed, which meant it wasn’t mine or anyone else’s concern and it certainly wasn’t news. I wasn’t surprised it’d made the morning edition, though. Nothing raised brows higher or bottom lines quicker than sex.

Still, I didn’t think that’s what Jay was talking about. One, because he wasn’t like that. Sarge wouldn’t have hired him, and I wouldn’t be working with him — in *any* capacity — if he were.

But two, they’d since moved on to the only thing *everyone* was talking about these days, and you didn’t have to be a size queen (I wasn’t) to appreciate the irony.

Too big to fail, my ass.

(Again? Yes, *again*.)

Soul Stuck in an Area

I have always had an other worldly connection to the unknown/unseen ect. 
I’ve been working at a gas station for about 4 months now… 
This gas station had an accident where somebody passed away just outside.
The person was going there for a specific reason and I will get to that more…
At first I heard that the night shift worker believed there was a ghost there…
I started doing nights on my own and I soon understood what they meant.
I was cleaning some milk jugs in the sink and I felt something hit my leg with some force to it, I then turned around and here was a little ketchup packet on the floor behind me.
I then had another experience the other day where an ice cream scooper got thrown right off our coffee machine.

So the person that passed away was going to the gas station for an ice cream and was struck by a car as they were pulling into the parking lot.

That event happened back in 2014 so I believe if they’re stuck there, they’ve been stuck in this space for exactly 10 years now 

I’ve heard a lot about souls getting free, once they’ve completed what they were supposed to do at their time of death…
Or even that an area can hold a memory long after death and that it can be freed 

I believe that the spirit is trying to tell me to get his ice cream for him, to free him.

Could this be the case and could I free him by doing so?
Just simply by buying him an ice cream and take it over the road to his memorial?

How do I go about releasing the spirit from this space? Because I sure as hell would hate to be stuck in a space for eternity let alone 10 years…😕

Would my idea do anything?
How would I know that I have freed him?

First time posting on reddit too,
I’m sorry if this is too long 🫤
I just really want to help this dude!

I've been reading up on modern sail ships and asking questions while working on some solarpunk sailing artwork. At this point, I think I have gathered enough information that it might be useful to someone else.

So if you want to include ships in your solarpunk story (even just mentioned in the background) or you’re looking for references for some artwork, take a look. I’m very much not an expert, but I’ve been pestering some of them, and collecting examples from the internet and doing my best to organize it. Hopefully this by-laymen-for-laymen approach will help make it accessible without leading you astray.

One thing to note up front: there’s a ton of variety here. Historical nautical terminology is remarkably chaotic – probably because most of it predates manufacturing practices that involved standardization. Highlights include the fact that ships can be classified based on size, sail plan, rigging, hull type, how they’re used, some combination thereof, or whether they have a figurehead or not. Modern sail-based freight shipping is still very new and I get the impression that the industry as a whole is sort of picking up old ideas and new ones and trying them in different combinations to see what fits. There are very few finished examples underway out in the world and I’m not sure we’ll know what designs are the absolute best for which use cases until a lot more ships have been launched and put to work.

That said, I think we’re definitely going to see a resurgence of sail and it seems like there’s a decent amount of interest and enthusiasm in the industry, even if many are understandably nervous about making huge changes when those changes involve incredibly expensive ships.

# Why sail?

It’s the original zero-carbon (-ish, they deforested huge amounts of land and destroyed entire habitats to build ships back when) shipping and transportation system. We had the technology to move cargo and passengers using the wind to directly do most of the work, and we have the technology (metal hulls, automated rigging, satellite navigation systems, radio, etc) to do it much more safely than our ancestors could. Even if a shipping company isn’t motivated by regulations or pure environmental reasons, oil will get more expensive eventually and that will cut into the profitability of giant motor vessels.

# How shipping might change:

Modern day shipping is extremely cheap but only when you limit the metrics you track to money. When you account for the pollution, the waste, it gets a lot harder to justify. A huge part of keeping modern day cargo shipping cheap is using the absolute worst fuel (bunker fuel, tar-like stuff left over after distilling and cracking petroleum, which is contaminated with everything the fuel they were actually making couldn’t include), as soon as they hit international waters.

I think a solarpunk society is one that cares about externalities. 

I genuinely like the optimization and logistical advantage of using standardized, stackable shipping containers which fit on ships, trucks, and trains without the need to load and unload the cargoes by hand at each transition in their journey. That’s great stuff, no complaints.

What I wonder about is if the cost efficiency brought by combining containerization with ever-more-massive, bunker-fuel-burning ships has caused other problems. We ship cargo all over the world but much of the time, we do it because it’s so cheap to do so. Many of those containers are full of cheap tat that ends up in landfills after one use or no use at all. We ship raw material from one continent to process it on another, we ship that material to another so it can be shaped into parts, which are shipped away for partial assembly on another continent, and then again for final assembly. Is that efficient? It’s cost efficient. But we burn terrible amounts of fuel each time we do it, and we do it for so many things.

When you read through the handful of real sail ships operating today, a theme becomes somewhat clear – these early (for profit) ones at least are primarily transporting the same high-value or location-specific cargoes sail ships were carrying a hundred years or more ago. Wines, champagnes, and other liquors, raw coffee, raw cocoa, luxury goods like that. This is partly because they need to justify the up-front cost of standing up a whole new kind of shipping, because they’re often slower, and because there are already crew shortages even before getting into the specialized skillsets related to sailing by wind. So they’re currently prioritizing the kind of specialty products (that only grow in certain climates or need special skills or reputation to produce) that exist in one place with markets in others, where they can markup for greener shipping. As they expand, the range of products will no doubt expand as well - cargo ships used to carry all kinds of stuff. But even with massive fleets (to make up for the fact that it’ll be hard to make single ships as big as we have now for reasons I’ll get to) we probably won’t see shipping done as cheap as it is today. Generally I think this lines up well with solarpunk principles like building to your local environment using local materials, manufacturing things locally, and building them to last and to be repairable. Shipping would fit the things that have to come from somewhere else.

# The motor to wind spectrum:

I think it’s safe to say that almost any ship is going to be some kind of hybrid between motor vessel and sailing vessel. What ratio of wind to other energy (electricity, biodesiel, hydrogen, bunker fuel) is up to you. I will say there’s potential for a timeline here, starting with the majority being modern-day cargo ships with sails bolted on saving around 20% of their fuel, and transitioning towards more numerous, smaller ships using more and more wind, until the bulk of the fleet is primarily-sail ships with auxiliary motors or engines for maneuvering in port and dealing with emergencies. And chances are good that ships from all over that spectrum will be sailing at the same time.

# So what does modern-day shipping look like?

We should cover the current landscape a little so you know what the new stuff is competing with or building on.

Most of the sites I’ve read break cargo ships into a few big categories:

**Container ships:**

These are apparently the most common and probably for good reason. The convenience and efficiency of shipping containers allows for some real benefits. Cargo can be packed into a 20′, 40′ and 45′ long container, transported by truck or train to a port, loaded onto a ship, transported to another continent, lifted onto trains and trucks and not actually unpacked until it reaches its destination. When the alternative is people physically carrying stuff onto the ship and packing it into the hold, and carrying it out and packing it into a truck, you can see where there’d be some advantages. (Palatalized cargo is a sort of great middle ground that allows for better weight distribution in the hold (you want the heaviest stuff near the bottom so the ship is stable) and can be loaded very similarly to how containers are (you move the entire pallet, so it doesn’t get unpacked until it reaches its destination) but that’s not super relevant at the moment.)

The big modern container ships can transport 85 TEUs (twenty equivalent units) to 15,000+ depending on their size. So far the [biggest primarily-sail design](https://www.wind.coop/en/the-sailing-cargo/) I can find can haul 100 TEU containers.

Putting sails on these is kind of difficult because they use the deck for cargo space and will have cranes loading and unloading containers whenever they’re in port. Apparently this isn’t as big an issue as I expected, but it’s still something to keep in mind, especially if there’s tons of rigging involved in the design of the sails.

There’s a ton of designs out there for adding big easy-to-use sails and kites to existing container ships in order to boost their efficiency and cut fuel use somewhat. They’re in use now and have some good info if you’re looking for hard numbers. I haven't really covered them in these notes much.

I find container sailships to be the most interesting (something about the mix of old and new, and the fact that containers make the ship's purpose visually clear) so I’ve got a bunch of examples of them below.

**Roll-on roll-off ships:**

These ships are used to transport wheeled cargo, things like private cars, industrial vehicles, buses, trucks, construction equipment, excavators, etc. They usually have a huge door in the side or stern and the vehicles can directly roll on and off the vessel. They seem to be a popular choice for full-sail cargo ships because they don’t need to worry as much about keeping the decks clear for loading and unloading. How well they’ll fit in a solarpunk world is up to you – some vehicles and wheeled equipment will undoubtedly have to be transported overseas but whether there’ll be enough to justify this class of ship is up to you. Neoline is a good primarily-sail example of this type, Norsepower is a more traditional primarily-fuel version.

**Dry Bulk Carriers:**

These transport solid non-packaged loose dry cargo in bulk quantities. Think wheat/grain, chemicals for fertilizer, cement, wheat, sugar, coal, iron ore etc. Some of the last sail vessels in operation were bulk carriers, like the [Flying P-Liners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_P-Liner), some of which were still transporting nitrates in the 1950s. Most of the modern sailships listed below seem to do at least some of this.

**Tankers:**

These ships transport large amount of liquid cargoes like petroleum products (oil, gas), chemicals, wine, juice, etc. in bulk. They are probably a good fit for a wider range of sail types since they don’t need to worry as much about keeping the decks clear for loading and unloading.

**Reefer ships:**

(Short for refrigerator) they’re designed to transport frozen/temperature-controlled cargoes, mainly in refrigerated containers. Food and perishable goods (fruits, vegetables, meat, fish…). I don’t have much info on these (except that I think a lot of the container examples should apply). I do suspect these would be one of the most challenging as they’ll need a lot of power onboard.

# Considerations for sailing cargo vessels:

This info is mostly pulled from [some excellent comments provided by the folks on the Naval Architecture subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/navalarchitecture/comments/1fvfaj0/a_question_about_modern_sail_ship_designs/), especially Open\_Ad1920.

This is a simplified summary, there are definitely details I left out that you can find over there.

**What kind of sails do you need?**

The most obvious (to most of us) difference between motor vessels and sail vessels is the huge masts and sails on top. For cargo vessels, they seem like they should pose huge issues for cranes in the ports (in the case of containerized shipping) but apparently this isn’t as much of an issue with larger and more modern crane designs as I would have expected. The modern cranes lift their booms to allow tall structures past, then lower them to the working position. Apparently they already work right up alongside tall structures on modern cargo ships so masts should be similar.

Where masts pose a problem is with going under bridges. Bridges often block ports and rivers where sail ships would like to enter. Most all of our modern bridge and port infrastructure was built in the days after tall ships had been replaced by steam and motor vessels, but that means there are trillions of dollars worth of port infrastructure that would be blocked to anything with a mast.

This has been a major motivator for folding mast designs. Some sails are better suited to folding masts than others, so consider the routes and ports your ship would likely see, and whether it would need to get past bridges. Consider bridge height, the height of the mast normally associated with your ship height, and whether the mast needs to fold. If it does, consider which sails are well-suited to doing so.

* Several modern/proposed designs like the Windcoop or Neoliner use rigid sails on masts that can apparently fold down.
* Of the more traditional designs, junk rigs / Chinese lug sails / fully battened lug sails seem to be the best candidate for a folding mast and [are apparently pretty easy to use](https://www.kastenmarine.com/junk_rig.htm). Hasler & McLeod for more info. They may use curved battens that flip to orient the curve towards the tack in order to make close-hauled upwind performance comparable to that of a bermuda rig. If you need to understand those terms in order to write your story at the correct level of detail, you probably either know them already or are about to dive in to the world of nautical terminology, in which case best of luck! Lots more info [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/navalarchitecture/comments/1fvfaj0/comment/lrcua20/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).
* Lateen or “crab claw” varieties fold fine. Unfortunately they don’t very efficiently upwind.
* I’m told a bermuda main sail with in-boom furling is also conceivably compatible with a folding mast but that hasn’t been done yet.

**Water draft/how deep is the ship below the waterline?**

Water draft is another major consideration for port entry. Ports and rivers are shallower than the open ocean and sailing vessels with reasonably good performance will have a deeper draft than an equivalent motor vessel. This is for two reasons that I think basically sum up to ‘preventing the sails from tipping the ship over’ and ‘preventing the wind from pushing the ship sideways’:

* Ballast weight – the lower they can hang the ballast, the lower the vessel’s center of gravity. This makes it more stable against the tendency of the sails to pull it over onto its side.
* The protruding part under the hull acts as a wing in the water, producing horizontal lift. This counteracts the sideways component of the forces generated by the sails when traveling upwind, or even perpendicular to the wind. Having this makes the ship safer by helping prevent it from getting pushed onto shores, rocks, and reefs by unfavorable winds. This extra lateral area is going to stick out way under the hull for hydrodynamic reasons.

To allow them to enter these ports, modern sail ships might use lifting keels or have a flatter bottom, no keel fin, with daggerboards to provide that control while being able to lift up and cross into shallower water.

**How tippy is it?**

Motor vessels can make do with a higher center of gravity and much lower angle of vanishing stability (AVS). This is the point at which the vessel will capsize and stay inverted, thus sinking it. That’s because they don’t have sails making it easy for the wind to tip them. Sailing ships tend to lean more while underway, so they can’t pile containers as high.

Containers also don’t allow for the cargo to be packed quite as densely, or apportioned particularly well within the vessel from heavy to light as you go upwards compared to other systems. You just get what you get. Heavier containers can be placed lower, but the overall packaging density is less so the center of gravity still ends up higher than with more piecemeal loading methods. Palletization is a good compromise that can still load a sizable vessel in acceptable time. So while there’s a bunch of interesting container sailboat designs, I think we probably won’t see something equivalent to the absolutely massive cargo ships transporting thousands of containers.

However, this is another place where folding masts can help – being able reef the sails and tip them down during bad weather provides additional stability/safety so the ship can be loaded to a higher center of gravity.

# Examples:

This is a list of new, operating, and proposed sailship designs. I’m going to sort them from less-traditional to more-traditional as determined by me (a person who learned most of this terminology a week ago). There are a lot of traditional sailboat designs seeing a resurgence, with various modernizations ranging from basic stuff like metal hulls, on-board motors, and modern navigation and communication equipment, to fancier stuff like automated sails on rotating masts.

**The** [**Windcoop container ship**](https://www.wind.coop/en/the-sailing-cargo/) - this one has heavily-automated sails with very little rigging, making it easier to load and unload cargo. It can haul 100 TEUs which is the highest number I’ve found so far. It appears to have been designed by the same folks who drew up this one [https://www.dykstra-na.nl/designs/wasp-ecoliner/](https://www.dykstra-na.nl/designs/wasp-ecoliner/) which would have used dynarig sails. At time of writing, neither has been revealed or launched.

[**Neoliner**](https://www.neoline.eu/en/the-neoline-solution/#neoliner) - cosmetically similar to Windcoop (I think, anyways), this is a roll-on roll-off cargo ship with heavily automated sails which can fold down to go under bridges. This has also not launched yet.

**The** [**Anemos**](https://interestingengineering.com/photo-story/worlds-largest-sailing-cargo-ship-anemos), an 81-meter ‘Phoenix’ class ship (I can’t find an equivalent historical type) with a thousand-ton capacity and some automation on the sails. It’s currently transporting cognac, champagne, coffee, and other high-value cargoes.

**The** [**SV Juren AE**](https://www.autoevolution.com/news/this-highly-innovative-sailing-supply-ship-is-a-game-changer-for-the-marshall-islands-238541.html) a 48-meter cargo vessel with an Indosail-Sailing Rig and a 300-ton capacity. It looks much more like modern ships to me, and has an interesting frame rig on the structure near the stern covered in solar panels. A few other ships have used the Indosail rig, including one of Greenpeace’s Rainbow Warrior Ships (I think the one the french didn’t blow up?).

**The** [**Harryproa**](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/65193472eadeb133523da70f/t/65d603737972197f559e6632/1708524406510/Cargo+Proa+Prototype.pdf) (and [any other cargo proa designs](https://proafile.com/multihull-boats/articles/section/outrigger-canoes/P10)). These use hull designs borrowed from the outrigger sailing canoes of the Pacific Islands. Made from fiberglass using simple, modular molds, they’re intended to be easy to build and repair. One hull is intended to transport up to 10 tonnes of cargo in modular containers, while the other holds the crew quarters and ferry seating space for 25 passengers. It has a built-in tender (small boat) for reaching areas the main ship can’t, and for powering the main ship when it needs it. This may also be a good candidate for the river boat section below. [https://www.harryproa.com/](https://www.harryproa.com/)

[**The Iliens**](https://www.belleileenmer.co.uk/offers/iliens-quiberon-en-3090192/), a sail catamaran with a 68-passenger capacity traveling along the coast between Quiberon and Belle-Île in France.

[**Grain de Sail II**](https://www.bairdmaritime.com/shipping/dry-cargo/vessel-review-grain-de-sail-ii-french-transport-companys-cargo-sailship-built-for-trans-atlantic-crossings), a 24-meter, metal-hulled clipper ship with a 350 ton capacity, transporting wines, raw coffee and cocao following the trade winds. It looks somewhat more traditional in the rigging to me. [https://graindesail-overseas.com/grain-de-sail-ii](https://graindesail-overseas.com/grain-de-sail-ii)

[**https://gosailcargo.com/ships.html**](https://gosailcargo.com/ships.html) A list of designs for somewhat traditional (I think) sailboats designed to transport shipping containers, starting with a clipper and working down to small boats. I really appreciate the diagrams they provide with each ship description and feature list. I don’t think any of these have been built yet but they’re based on historical designs. I didn't notice any mention of being able to lower the masts, but some other tall ships, like the USCG training vessel Eagle (a three-masted barque), have upper mast sections that can be lowered to squeeze under modern bridges so that might be an option.

[**The SV Kwai**](https://www.hrmm.org/history-blog/sail-freighter-friday-sv-kwai-2006-present) for an example of a motor vessel retrofitted with fairly traditional sails. This allowed it to visit ports that weren’t considered profitable for motor vessels. A reuse-focused solarpunk society might make a lot of similar retrofits.

[**Sailcargo**](https://www.sailcargo.inc/) – a company operating a small fleet of wood-hulled schooners. They have a fair number of photos to use as references, including some clever solar panel placement.

[**Tres Hombres**](https://fairtransport.eu/en/onze-vloot/tres-hombres/) - about as traditional-looking as it gets – an engineless, wood-hulled brigantine made in the 1940s transporting rum, cocoa, coffee and olive oil.

[**Vega**](https://vega1892.com/historic-vessel-vega-about-the-boat/) - (a looks like either a galleass or a cutter?) built in 1892 and formerly used to transport limestone, bricks, pig iron and cement, it is still in use today, transporting free school and health supplies to remote islands in eastern Indonesia and to East Timor. More info here: [https://www.hrmm.org/history-blog/sail-freighter-friday-galleass-vega-1892-present](https://www.hrmm.org/history-blog/sail-freighter-friday-galleass-vega-1892-present)

This is far from an exhaustive list, if you know of a cool ship or design I should include by all means let me know and I’ll add it!

**River Sailboats** – here’s a few examples (real or proposed) which would operate on large rivers like the Hudson, hauling cargoes or passengers. (Here’s a neat worldbuilding idea I found in the [IWSA Small Windships Publication](https://issuu.com/international_windship_association/docs/iwsa_-_small_vessel_publication) – the term ‘Sail Freight’ is apparently more common in the US while Sail Cargo is more common in Europe – both terms seem to have gained popularity independently, but in the US it was mostly in the context of rivers and coasts while in Europe it seems to be more about ocean cargo. It wouldn’t be unreasonable for sail freight to come to mean transporting cargo on rivers (competing with trucks and trains) while sail cargo ends up referring to the ocean.)

**Schooner:**

**Sloop:**

**Gaff yawl:**

[https://gosailcargo.com/secret-40.html](https://gosailcargo.com/secret-40.html) – hauling a single shipping container or a modular ‘bus’ passenger compartment.

For recreation, these could be cool to include: [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moth\_(dinghy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moth_(dinghy))

The Eriemax canal barge [https://www.shipshares.com/Eriemax%20Final%20Report.pdf](https://www.shipshares.com/Eriemax%20Final%20Report.pdf)

Known for its somewhat chaotic looking collection of sails, the [junk-rigged schooner Summer Wind](https://tallshipsamerica.org/vessels/summer-wind/#) does tours of Baltimore harbour

Like the ships, these smaller watercraft will likely need some kind of motor for tight maneuvering, emergencies, lack of wind, and to work as their primary power in some canals (similar to the old sail-driven [canal barges](https://www.lcmm.org/visit/lois-mcclure/history-of-sailing-canal-schooners/) (sailboats intended to lift dagger boards and drop masts when they get to the canal but able to operate as sailboats outside it). Perhaps these could even operate as [trolly boats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_boat) using overhead wires for power when they get to the canal so they wouldn’t require dense onboard energy storage.

# Other Solarpunk Ship Stuff:

**Other types of vessel**

This post is mostly about cargo but there’s a ton of sail-based passenger stuff out there. I’ve gathered a few examples and will add more as I find new ones:

A company called Star Clipper is operating three tall ship cruise ships, [Star Flyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Flyer), [Star Clipper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Clipper), and [Royal Clipper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Clipper). These look like older style clipper ships to me so they might actually be using mostly wind. They seem to be very much operating in the cruise ship format, probably with some associated issues, but they demonstrate that passenger liners could still be viable (and can be quite comfortable) if a change in pace of life or available resources reduces the number of airplanes for that kind of travel.

[Seacloud](https://www.seacloud.com/en/seacloudspirit/The), another sail-based cruise ship

A company called WindStar Cruises also operates a series of cruise-ship-sized ‘motor sailing yachts.’ These have sails but I don’t think these actually rely much on wind, at best I suspect they’re closer to the cargo ships with rotary sails bolted on to save some fuel. One of the naval architects on reddit [seemed to confirm this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/navalarchitecture/comments/1fvfaj0/comment/lrcua20/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

There are also smaller crafts such as the 38-meter [Schooner Mary Day](https://www.sailmainecoast.com/fleet/schooner-mary-day/) which can carry 28 passengers. This may be duplicate with the schooner example from the Hudson above, but it still represents the potential for sail-based water buses on both rivers and coasts.

River and harbour cleanup boats like [Mr. Trash Wheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Trash_Wheel) (even if you hope a more solarpunk society would have less plastic trash, storms and floods can wash all kinds of non-trash stuff into the rivers).

There’s also the scaled-up version of those ([though stopping plastic in the rivers appear to still be the critical part](https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2023-03-17/ocean-cleanup-plastic-pollution-great-pacific-garbage-patch/102075810))

**Magazines and publications with lots of good info:**

**The** [**IWSA Small Windships Publication**](https://issuu.com/international_windship_association/docs/iwsa_-_small_vessel_publication) has tons of info on the sub-500GT range of smaller vessels including more info on most of the ships from the examples section (so it would have been really convenient if that was the first thing I found!). You can get a downloadable version [here](https://www.gosailcargo.com/pdf/IWSA-Small-Vessel-Publication-2024.pdf). Developments of Note lists a bunch of goo ships starting on page 10 and Sources for Vessel Plans on page 71 are especially useful but it’s all cool stuff.

**Whale Safety**

Whales are sometimes hit by ships (they sleep just below the surface and don’t know where human shipping lanes are). Some hulls are more dangerous to them than others. Ships with steep, sharp prows and [bulbous bows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulbous_bow) are especially dangerous for whales. If you search for ship hulls and whale safety, you’ll find an unfortunate number of photographs of dead whales draped over those bulbs.

One suggestion is to follow some cargo ferry designs and design the prow of the ship so it’s more traditional, angled forward so the deck is further forward than where the hull meets the waterline, with no bulb below the surface, and a much more rounded/blunt bowstem. This design will likely lose some performance benefits while underway but if it hits a whale I guess it’s more likely to sort of dunk them rather than to slam into them like an axe.

There are also ongoing attempts to map our whale activity and to ensure that human crews are both aware of their presence and actually making efforts to avoid them, but if you’re looking for visuals this might be worth considering.

**Lists of current projects:**

[This event](https://www.windforgoods.fr/en/page/exhibitors) has a decent list of current modern sail ships, from basically-modern-cargo-ships-with-sails-bolted-on to completely modernized 90-100% wind driven ships, to largely historical designs still in use.

1g4fcia,https://www.reddit.com/r/socalhiking/comments/1g4fcia/trip_report_whitney_portal_and_cottonwood_lakes/,Trip Report: Whitney Portal and Cottonwood Lakes Trail to Cirque Lake,"Hi all,

**TL:DR**

**Stayed in Whitney Portal for one night.  Site 24.  Good for two large tents**  
**Giant pancakes awesome as usual.**  
**Cottonwood Lakes Trail in great condition.**  
**Hiked to Cirque Lake using the South Fork Cottonwood Creek Trail.**  
**About 5 miles one-way.**

**Details for those interested:**

Took my son and Max, the Husky, on a planned 3 day backpacking trip to Cottonwood Lakes.  We also planned on spending a night at Whitney Portal so my son could experience the giant pancake first hand, and also to help with acclimation.  Not sure if it actually helps, but is a good reason to visit the Portal and eat some good food and see the sights.

We stayed in site 24.  Great site albeit a bit close to the bathroom so you'd get that vault toilet smell now and then.  Not awful, but noticeable.  Room enough for two large tents in this site.  Pulling straight in to the parking spot would be easy.  As most people seem to do, we backed in.  Not difficult but, because of the narrow-ish road, you have to be a bit careful.

The site was clean and ready for our arrival and the bathrooms were clean.

Some people had fires going.  We did not.  Wood was $9/ bundle.  As we drove by, I noticed a sign that said ""Host Day Off"".  I assume firewood is on the honor system.

Spent the night there.  In the morning, we shared a pancake (realistically, they'd feed 5 or 6 people), coffee and hot chocolate and drove up to the Cottonwood Lakes Trailhead.  Got changed and headed out.  First (and only) stop was Cirque Lake.  About 5 miles in if you take the South Fork Cottonwood Creek Trail- which is a great trail, but don't spread it around.  It'll be our little secret.

Cirque Lake was amazing (I'd been there once before).  We were the only ones there.  Such a neat place to spend some time.  We had planned on going to Muir Lake next and then another camp TBD for the third night.

For (reasons), I decided to hike out the next morning and head back home. Still a great time and I'm sure we'll be back.

Temps were maybe 50-55 during the daytime hike in and mid 30's overnight.  About what [weather.gov](http://weather.gov) predicted.  Mountain-Forecast, as usual, didn't seem accurate.  Not to mention, I have no idea why their Max/ Min temps are only a few degrees off.

Any questions, feel free to ask.

1g4fbzn,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/1g4fbzn/gilmore_girls_on_hbo/,Gilmore Girls on HBO,"I'm in love with Gilmore Girls, but it really makes me wonder how edgy this show could have been if it were on HBO. Thoughts?

So I’ve been rewatching Gilmore Girls (again, of course), and while I adore the fast-talking, coffee-fueled charm, I can't help but wonder how different the show could have been if it were created for a network like HBO. I mean, look at what happened with the dark Fresh Prince reboot (Bel-Air)—it really delves deeper into the characters and their issues. What would Gilmore Girls look like with that same level of grit and realism?

Would Rory's academic pressure lead to a substance abuse storyline? Maybe Logan introduces her to drugs? Maybe Dean was actually abusive to Lindsay? Maybe Jess reveals childhood SA from his mom's boyfriends? 

Even Stars Hollow could take on a darker vibe, with more intense small-town drama behind the perfect façade.

What are some other darker themes do you think this new Gilmore Girls could touch?",0,1729018482.0,GilmoreGirls,1,0.2,False
1g4f9cn,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_QueenNefertari69/comments/1g4f9cn/caffeine_poisoning/,Caffeine Poisoning,"Countless nights, I lay awake,  
Haunted by insomnia's relentless ache.  
 Tossed and turned, repositioned and sheep counting,   
I searched in vain, relief from unending pain.  
  
Countless remedies I tried to find,  
But none could ease my troubled mind.  
No matter what I did or tried,  
Sleep still eluded, the hours passed by.  
  
Then, a breakthrough, a revelation clear,  
Caffeine poisoning, the cause of my fear.  
In every cup of coffee, a hidden foe,  
That kept me tossing, turning, in woe.  
  
With resolve, I banished caffeine's hold,  
No more coffee, no more stories untold.  
And slowly, surely, my sleep returned,  
No longer by insomnia, was I spurned.  
  
Oh, the relief, the joy I felt,  
To finally break free from caffeine's belt.  
A lesson learned, a price paid dear,  
But now I sleep soundly, without fear.

1g4f8zk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Plumbing/comments/1g4f8zk/help_with_a_hot_water_dispenser/,Help with a hot water dispenser!,"Just redid our kitchen and decided to go for an instant hot/cold water dispenser for the wet bar. We bought [this Graff faucet](https://www.graff-designs.com/en/catalog/kitchen/dett/7158/harley-hot-cold-water-dispenser/) which is designed for this purpose.

The guy we bought the faucet from also sold us an insinkerator HWT-300, but when my plumber went to install it he realized it wasn't actually compatible with the Graff, so the sales rep swapped it for a [Mountain MT641-3](https://mountainplumbing.com/product/little-gourmet-premium-hot-water-tank-2/).

The problem is that I got it home and looked it up, and it's really not what we want - the max temp is only 190F, which is totally useless for tea or coffee, and the installation sheet STRONGLY recommends installing a leak detection device, which while good advice, doesn't inspire a whole lot of confidence. Reviews seem to imply that it works for a couple years and then starts leaking, which is not really what i want in my brand new six-figure kitchen.

I'm willing to pay more for something that can get a proper coffee/tea temperature (205-210), but for some reason it's really tough to find any good information about compatibility, probably because I'm completely ignorant about how it all works, what terminology to use when searching, what brands even make these things, etc. Graff does not sell a proprietary heater and there's no recommendation about what to use on their site.

Are there any models compatible with this style of faucet that have a higher temp and maybe less potential to start leaking in a couple years? Or should i cut my losses and just replace it with a regular-ass faucet?

We finally agreed to go on a date and decided to get coffee. We had a really good time and talked a lot. I thought he felt the same, but apparently not, because he ghosted me right after the date. I told him it was fine to let me know if he didn’t enjoy the date because I’d rather know than be left in the dark but he still ghosted me. Why can’t we be a bit more thoughtful? Getting ghosted after a date is something that sticks with you for a long time. Please just let us know if you’re not interested; we’d rather hear it than be left hanging.",3,1729018249.0,askgaybros,6,0.71,False
1g4f889,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1g4f889/my_toddler_got_second_degree_burns_on_a_united/,My toddler got second degree burns on a United flight…help!,"So long story short my family and I were traveling home last night on a United flight from Denver. I was traveling with my mother in law, husband and our 2 kids, one of which is a 2 year old. Upon our initial descent into our final destination my toddler started crying because his ears were hurting due to the change in pressure. A flight attendant approached us and said she had something for him that could help his ears and returned with a cup of what she claimed was warm water. She told us to hold the cup and put his ear on top of the cup and the water would relieve the pressure. My husband was holding our son trying to do this when my son jerked and the entire cup spilled all over him. To our horror it was not warm water in the cup but boiling water from what I now assume was a kettle or coffee pot. We didn’t initially realize how hot the water was because she handed it to us in an insulated coffee cup so it was only warm to the touch or else we would have never even attempted doing this with a toddler in the first place. 

Upon his wailing i immediately realized something was very wrong and started frantically ripping his clothes off. His shirt was already starting to stick to the raw skin where the burns were already forming. At this point another flight attendant approached me and asked if she could pour some cool water on his burns so we did that in the airplane bathroom. Other than that no other medical attention was given to him. They asked if I would like them to call a medic upon landing which I immediately said yes. Landing took another ten or so minutes. During this time the skin on his ear, neck and shoulder started to peel away and blister.

We ended up taking him to a children’s emergency room as soon as we landed and he was treated for second degree burns. He has a burn graph (not skin graph) on his shoulder and medicated ointment for his neck and ear. Thankfully it didn’t enter his ear drum and do any damage there. 

My question is- is this something I should sue over? The flight attendant was very apologetic and I knew she felt awful but if this is common practice for them to tell passengers to help kids with their ear pressure then that’s very scary. I feel like they should at least cover our son’s medical bills?

Other stuff I've donated:

* 2 massive suitcases full of new clothes belonging to my mom. One of them weighs at least 70 lbs.
* 2 empty suitcases that I never use
* 4 more bags of clothes
* 4 boxes of books in good condition
* 3 paintings and wall art

* deep fryer
* juicer
* a few other assorted electrical kitchen appliances
* small boxes of trinkets and utensils
* dinner plates and cups I never use
* childhood toys and teddy bears
* tote bags I forgot I had (cleaned out a closet)

Have cleaned and rolled up 5 area rugs to donate as well. I already have more boxes of trinkets, books and other stuff ready to go. A box full of college papers and notebooks are ready for recycling and shredding. The days I haven't driven to the donation centres, I've done stuff at home.

Honestly, I am feeling a **bit** overwhelmed so I think I will take a break today. I don't want to get burned out as there's lots more to do still.

To address mental health concerns, I am seeing my therapist tomorrow.

English, both in our 40's and well travelled across Europe. I've been to the States many times mainly with work but she has yet to visit. Really just want to experience and see the city sights, but with enough structure to make the most of the visit. We are both fans of European city breaks and very happy to wander and explore. We have a couple of 'must do's (very unoriginal) and have broadway tickets booked. Our hotel is very central, a couple of blocks North West from Times Square.

Interests - general exploring, nice coffee, craft beer and cocktails. I love music so want to find an authentic blues or jazz bar (thinking Brooklyn).

Here is rough itenary:

Thursday:

* Arrive JFK 4pm, train to Grand Central
* Get to hotel 6ish, check in
* Steak dinner in Hells Kitchen area

Friday;

* Statue of Liberty - either Staten island ferry or a boat tour
* Brooklyn to explore at lunchtime
* Dinner and Jazz/blues music, Brooklyn

Saturday:

* Harlem for brunch
* Explore Harlem and Central Park
* WTC Memorial
* High line park walk
* Dinner - needs to be booked
* Gypsy Musical - broadway (booked)

Sunday:

* Brunch in Village or somewhere cool
* Shopping in Times Sq
* Explore another neighbourhood/view from a sky scraper
* Arrive JFK for 6pm

Any suggestions? Mainly want to know if the general structure is good, and also any recommendations for blues/jazz in Brooklyn (though can prob find this using search.....)

What neighbourhood areas are cool for looking at alternative/independant shops? We want to do plenty of shopping so clothes, music and general nick-nack shops would be cool.

1g4f0j8,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditserials/comments/1g4f0j8/time_looped_chapter_24/,[Time Looped] - Chapter 24,"The chapter is 25

Dead goblins covered the bathroom floor. Even more were pinned lifelessly to the walls. Sadly, despite the many killed, three remained alive, standing above Helen’s lifeless body.

For several seconds, Will stood there, his mind unable to comprehend what his eyes were seeing. There was no way Helen could be killed. As a knight, fighting was her element. She had undoubtedly proved it by dispatching all the creatures that lay scattered about, and still they had managed to get to her.

Before he could realize what was going on, Jace rushed by him into the room. One of the goblins tried to turn around, only to get a dish in the face, sending it flying straight into the bathroom window.

“Fuck!” the jock swore, gripping his hand. As much pain as his punch had caused, he felt as if he’d received twice more in return. It was as if the creature he was fighting was made from stone.

The remaining two goblins snarled. Finished with their initial prey, they turned their attention to Jace, swinging at him with their knives. One of the weapons struck the jock’s thigh, sending him to the ground convulsing in agony. Coincidentally, it was this that snapped Will back to reality. Taking advantage of the fact that they weren’t paying attention to him, he rushed in, striking the nearest creature on the back of the neck. The method had worked fine a while ago, but this time he had the misfortune of hitting the goblin at the top of the spine. Lacking strength of accuracy, the tip of the blade pierced the skin, causing some significant discomfort, but failed to do much more.

With a scream, the target of the attack turned around. Eyes glared at the boy, conveying dozens of threats and curses in fractions of a second.

Still gripping the knife, the boy stepped back into the hallway. Losing the element of surprise, he had a pretty good idea of how this would end. There remained a one in a hundred chance that he might evade the goblin’s next attack, but even if he did, it wasn’t like he could kill it off, or rush to his mirror to get the rogue class.

“Why did you appear here?” he wondered, as he continued stepping back.

The goblins didn’t bother answering. No longer viewing Jace as a threat, both charged at Will, snarling as they did. The front one struck, aiming for the boy’s chest. The tip of the knife split the air, far too fast for Will to react, but just before it hit him, something caused the goblin to freeze in place.

*Did that just happen?* Part of the boy’s mind wondered. The rest instinctively made him swing his own knife, this time striking the side of the creature. The familiar disgusting gurgle followed.

“Lit hit!” Alex appeared out of nowhere.

“Huh?” Will looked at his friend. “Where were you?”

“Usual. Get my class, level up, get the notes from Mister June and the harpy…”

“You what? Why the heck will you do that now?!”

To Will’s annoyance, the goofball only shrugged.

“Tradition, bro,” he said with a smile. “Is cool, bro. Things are cool.”

Looking at the situation, things seemed anything but “cool.” The school was already starting to panic. The coach and a few more teachers were visible at the far end of the hallway, rushing in order to find out what was going on. News of the goblins had probably spread all over social media at this point. It wouldn’t be long before police, firefighters, and all the local media arrived to ask questions.

Meanwhile, Helen was dead and Jace wished he were.

“Time to rush, bro,” Alex said.

“What about Jace and Helen?”

“We’ll see them in eight minutes.”

Eight minutes… that meant that the entire goblin encounter had taken less than two. With all the adrenaline, Will felt that hours had passed.

As Will followed Alex to the exit, possibilities ran through his mind. If he had taken the rogue skill, maybe things would have been different. He’d have dealt with the creatures, that was for certain, possibly fast enough to help Helen before she was killed. Jace wouldn’t have had to step in and break his hand. The scene of panic, though, wouldn’t have been avoided, or would it?

In the background, several of the corpses had already turned transparent. In a matter of minutes, they would have vanished completely, just as the wolves did once they had been defeated.

Sirens sounded as the boys left the building. Naturally, there was yet a school announcement to be made. For some reason, people had a harder time accepting that goblins were real than wolves running down the hallways.

“What happened?” Will asked as the pair rushed across the street. “Were they supposed to appear like that?”

“No clue, bro. First time for me.”

The calmness with which he said it made the statement sound disingenuous.

“Danny didn’t say anything about them?”

“Maybe.” Alex glanced over his shoulder. “He said there were more than wolves a week before he died.”

The running turned to walking. Not long after, they were at their usual coffee shop, drinking cocoa. Several police cars had already reached the school. Even the local news channel had picked up the story, spinning all sorts of theories on what had actually happened. Not even overenthusiastic reporters dared mention the notion of disappearing goblins, so theyw ere keeping things simultaneously vague and ominous enough to increase their audience.

Will checked his phone. Two minutes remained until eight.

“Was it a mistake making her the key holder?” the boy asked, stirring his drink without as much as a sip.

“Girl’s a knight,” Alex replied, as if that explained it all. One had to admit that she had killed a lot more than Will, Jace, and the goofball combined.

“Did any of them jump out of your mirror?”

“Nah.”

“They must appear only when they see the key holder.” Just like wolves in corners. “Why the starting mirror, though?”

“Bro, eternity is…” Alex waved his hands about as if preparing for an incantation in a children’s show. “… eternity. No one knows. Shit happens.”

Will stopped stirring his drink. The liquid continued to twirl on its own.

“How do you manage?” He looked at the goofball. “Weirdness left and right and you’re calm as a champ.”

“Sigma chad, bro,” the other laughed. “Nah, you’ll get there in a few thousand loops. Not much new.”

“The goblins were new,”

“Used to newness.” Alex laughed, then chucked down the cocoa as if it were water, making even the barista wince. “Helen was new,” he added. “You too, bro.”

“Yes, we’re all new compared to you.”

“True that!”

The conversation was an exercise in uselessness, yet it had managed to provide enough calm for Will to start thinking about the problem at hand. Philosophical ponderings aside, they had been given a task with no obvious solution to complete. Last loop, Will was wondering how many loops it would take them to defeat the boss. Now, he wasn’t even sure they could deal with the initial wave of goblins.

“Can I have another, bro?” the goofball yelled at the barista.

“Shouldn’t you be at school?” the man asked, but took his cup and went for a refill.

“Nah. Big oof at school today. Won’t be over till noon.”

Everything considered that wasn’t far from the truth. It wouldn’t be a surprise if school was canceled for an entire week until enough people from enough institutions had done a thorough investigation. From their perspective, something weird had happened a week after the unusual suicide of a student. As far as the world outside the loops was concerned, there was a chance that both events were somehow connected. Speeches would be made, psychologists hired. The entire school would get sessions scheduled with Mister June to discuss what would be considered the most important topic of the day. Helen’s family would go in mourning and hold a small service, then after a few weeks, things would return to normal.

Suddenly, a terrifying idea crossed Will’s mind. What if there was another pause in eternity? The girl had claimed that Daniel was on track to find a way out of the game, then he had died and the cycle of loops was broken until Will had taken his place.

“Did Danny say anything about being a key holder?” the boy asked, checking the time on his phone. Seventeen seconds remained till the end of the loop.

“Nah, bro. Told you.”

“Are you sure?”

“Yup, bro. Why?”

“What if Helen’s dead?”

“Hey, don’t worry, bro. Happens. I’ve been dead plenty of times.”

“Dead dead!” Will all but shouted. “We chose her to be the key holder. What if it was our task to protect the key holder while she unlocks the mirrors and finds the boss?”

Several seconds passed with both Alex and Will looking at each other motionless, as if someone had transformed them into a pair of statues.

“Big oof,” the goofball said at last. That was something new that he hadn’t seen coming.

If Will’s suspicion was true, that meant that everything that had occurred today would remain unchanged until another participant was found.

“Sorry about this, but how exactly will you be paying?” the barista asked, placing the full mug of coco in front of Alex.

“Cash, bro,” the boy reached into his pocket.

“Cash?” The barista gave him a suspicious look. In general, the coffee shop accepted cash, even coins. That was part of its charm. Having a school student pay with cash so readily did raise a few red flags, though. “I thought all of you used phones.”

“Nah, bro. Left my wallet in my other phone.”

Before the man could get to make a comment on the topic, the loop ended.

 

**Restarting eternity.**

 

*Quickly, quickly!*

Will pulled his phone out of his pocket and quickly typed in Helen’s number. After the entire Danny file debacle, he had learned it by heart. This time, he wasn’t going to send a text, going directly for a call.

“Where are you?” He looked around. Normally, this was the time about which Jess and her friend would pass by and greet him with a random insult. For some reason, that hadn’t happened.

*It’s a reset*, he told himself. A new loop started, so it had to be a reset. That meant that Helen had to be alive and everything that happened ten minutes ago—goblins, death, and all—was nothing but a memory. And yet the girl refused to respond.

*Pick up! Pick up! Pick up!*

The call got declined. Will stared at the screen of his phone, uncertain how to react. Of all the times he’d phoned Helen after joining eternity, she hadn’t hung up on him once. Refusing to accept defeat, he quickly redialed and put his phone against his ear, as if that might increase his chances of success.

“What?” Helen asked in a rather annoyed tone.

*Thank goodness*, the boy let out a mental sign of relief. She was alive, at least.

“Where are you?” he asked.

“I’m in the hallway, right about to—”

“Don’t go in!” he interrupted. “Stay where you are and I’ll be there in a sec!”

“Why not?”

That wasn’t a question he wanted to hear. Keeping his phone between his head and his shoulder, Will rushed into the school, running towards the boy’s bathroom.

“Don’t you remember what happened yesterday?” he asked.

“Of course, I remember. Why do you think I—”

“Running in the hallways, Stone?” the massive figure of the coach asked, blocking Will’s bath.

The boy swallowed. He definitely didn’t remember this part. Normally, the coach would be gone by this time, off to have his shouting session with the football team. The fact that he wasn’t meant that something had changed. Seeing Helen a short distance away, giving him an annoyed glare, phone in hand, told him that she might have been the cause.

“I need to go, coach!” The boy feigned urgency and rushed by the coach.

The large man made a halfhearted attempt to stop him, but not really. As someone who had experienced similar situations, he empathized with the need to go to the toilet. Still, since his public image was on display, he diplomatically waited for Will to enter the boy’s bathroom, then went on a mini tirade about how it was proper to take care of bodily functions before going to school and not relying on finding a bathroom at the last minute. No one in the hallway paid much attention, which only gave the man the excuse to turn around and continue in the direction he had originally been heading before all this.

Meanwhile, Will went through the standard mirror sequence in the bathroom, tapping all of them in the known order. Messages appeared and disappeared, but he didn’t even read them. Taking advantage of the rogue’s reaction speed, he rushed out into the corridor again. The moment he did, the phone in his ear gave off the familiar sound indicating that the person on the other end had ended the call.

“Well?” Helen asked.

“I’m just glad you’re okay.” The boy smiled, then looked at the door to the girl’s bathroom. “Haven’t been there, right?”

“No.” Helen crossed her arms, still a bit suspicious.

“Let me borrow the knight for this loop, okay?”

Not waiting for an answer, Will rushed in. There was no sign of the goblins, nor thankfully, anyone else. The mirrors acted as normal, reflecting everything opposite them, just like any mirror would. Taking a deep breath, the boy tapped every mirror in turn, then ran to the exit, expecting a swarm of goblins to emerge. They didn’t.

*I was right,* he thought. Suddenly, his phone pinged.

**U ok?**

The message appeared. Will was just about to answer when he had a better idea, tapping on the video call icon. To little surprise, Helen accepted.

“Any goblins?” she asked, remaining in voice only.

“Not for now. Go full video.”

Helen’s profile picture changed, displaying her face.

“What’s up?” she asked.

“Hold there for a moment.” He pointed the screen of the phone at one of the mirrors. There was a moment of tenseness, though it was soon gone as nothing happened. Apparently, the key holder had to be in front of a mirror in person in order for the effect to be triggered.

“Nice try. Want me to come in?”

“No. Call the others. We’re going to the coffee shop. I have an idea.”",7,1729017684.0,redditserials,2,1.0,False

Pic 1 shows that. I went to a dentist, they repaired it and all was well for like 2 weeks. I had a partial dislocation of my left side jaw (this has happened before) so I tried to pop it back in place. It felt different and off and I had pain which usually isn’t bad but this time was worse than usual. I lost my bite guard and replacing it w a custom from the dentist wasn’t covered by insurance and was cost prohibitively expensive, as a broke grad student. After the 2nd chip, I picked up a drugstore one. The dentist repaired the second chip and it even looked better. That was early september. Last night, I was biting my nails again (I know, bad, but I didn’t even realize I was doing it) and it chipped for a third time, Pic 3. It seems to be getting slightly worse each time. It doesn’t hurt and isn’t especially sensitive, but it is visible and I’m embarrassed. I’m even more embarrassed to go back to the dentist (last time they covered the cost bc it shouldn’t have chipped again, which was really nice) so I just feel like such a jerk. Is there a stronger fix to a front tooth chip?   I know the TMJ/Jaw issues situation is contributing but I’m in the midst of other health issues and need to prioritize those for now before I can handle the issue I’ve had for over a decade. It doesn’t usually hurt and even seemed to go away for my first years of grad school but increased stress has made that more difficult. Any advice on the TMJ stuff?

She had Lived three lives and she suddenly got reincarnated in the body of her first life as a villainess! But the problem is...She was not a normal villainess in the novel. She was a villainess actually obsessed with the heroine, the heroine was her only friend and loved by all. Instead of getting jealous Jazzeline, the villainess was afraid to lose her only friend so she manipulated the heroine in to getting kidnapped which leads her to her ultimate demise. Death.

In this life she would do none of those! Let her family hate her! She doesn't even want to know the reason why she was hated nor did she care about her only friend Laria, the female lead. This time she would throw the milkshake, coffee and whatever she could get her hands on at her brother's face when he comes to bully her, not acknowledge the fact she is engaged and downright ignore the only duke in the empire who is also her 'father' and she should probably distance herself with Laria as well.

1g4em73,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParadiseCA/comments/1g4em73/date_nights_in_paradise/,Date Nights in Paradise,"Paradise is still recovering from the devastation of the Camp Fire, and although lots of new homes have found owners, the reality is most people still make the short trip down the hill to Chico for just about everything they need, including for date nights. Although my partner and I don’t get out of the house often, I’d like to recommend a few fun date ideas that are all here in town! I’ve done my best to estimate basic times and budgets for each, and please feel free to leave other fun Paradise date night ideas in the comments as well.  
  
  
**Date 1: View of the Valley**  
Budget: $0 - $10  
Time: 1-2 hours (5:30-7:00)  
Directions: Pack whatever you were going to already eat for dinner, and take it with you. Take your date with you to the Grocery Outlet in Paradise, and pick out their cheapest bottle of wine (make sure it’s a screwtop, or bring a bottle opener). After that, take your date down to Lookout Point on Skyway, park your car, and enjoy a little wine with your dinner while you watch the sunset over the far coastal mountains.  
Tips:  If you’re a fan of cheap wine, then go on a Wednesday - Grocery Outlet will give you 10% off your order if you buy 6 bottles. 
Sunset in late October starts just before 6:30, so get there ahead of time for a beautiful view as the sun goes down. If you aren’t staying in the car while you eat, you may want to bring a blanket depending on the weather.  

**Date 2: Sweet & Salty**  
Budget: $10 - $30  
Time: 1-2 hours (4:00-6:00)  
Directions: This date starts early! Drive to the intersection of Pearson & Black Olive Dr., and find a parking space near Joy Lyn’s Candies or the park across the way. You’ve got three lovely spots to visit all on the same corner. I'd suggest starting with something sweet at Joy Lyn’s Candies, a lovely little homemade candy shop that survived the Camp Fire in 2018. Be sure to ask lots of questions from the friendly folks there while you pick from a variety of chocolate, fudge, or sweet snacks. Next, you’ll head right across the street to Snoop Sisters, an antique store that moved in within the last year. Prices here can vary from reasonable to somewhat pricey, so just take your time and enjoy browsing the knick-knacks and baubles crammed into every nook and cranny. Last time I was here, they offered free popcorn! Wrap up your date by taking your snacks across the street to Paradise Community Park, it’s a cute little spot that also features the old Railroad Depot museum. The museum itself closes at 4 PM, so unless you are here during the day you’ll likely just sit outside on a park bench and chat.   
Tips: Joy Lyn’s Candies closes at 5:00 PM, so get in the door before then. If you’re around early enough, you could also visit the Depot Museum. 

**Date 3: Pizza & Games**  
Budget: $30 - $75  
Time: 2+ hours, Thursday-Sunday  
Directions: For this date, we’re recreating fun childhood memories of cheap pizza, arcade games and fun with people you care about. Start at the Little Caesar’s pizza place off Skyway in the large parking lot, order whatever pizza you like and don’t forget the Crazy Breadsticks and soda! You can eat there, or bring it around the corner to your next destination at Paradise Playdium. This fun arcade is open Thurs-Sunday (closed Mon-Wed), and features lots of arcade games, virtual reality, and axe throwing. They are also planning to add bumper cars and laser tag at some point in the near future as well.   
Tips:  If you’re having a good time, stay late! Paradise Playdium stays open till 11:00 PM Fri-Sun, which is later than most Paradise businesses. There’s also a Dutch Bros coffee spot just across the Skyway, if you want something sweet or warm to drink.  

**Date 4: Dinner and a Show**  
Budget: $60 - $90    
Time: 3-4 hours (5:00-9:00)   
Directions: Start your date off with dinner and drinks at Nic’s, a comfortable and welcoming spot that offers a good spread of tasty items including charcuterie, flatbread pizzas, salads and sandwiches, along with a nice variety of beers and wine. Place your order at the counter, and they’ll deliver it to your table. The interior is decorated with pieces by local artists, and the delicatessen provides a nice atmosphere that is sorely missed in Paradise after the Camp Fire. After dinner and drinks, head down the Skyway, then make a left on Neal Road to get to the Theatre on the Ridge, where you can enjoy a local small-town theatre production of various off-Broadway plays. The vibe here is relaxed, so unless you want to get dressed up, then you can just show as you are. Make sure to pre-purchase your tickets online, because if you show your Theatre on the Ridge tickets at Nic’s, you get a 10% discount on performance nights!  
Tips: Nic’s offers some decent vegetarian options, and hosts live music on Friday nights, while the Theatre on the Ridge sometimes has half-price matinees on Sunday afternoons.",2,1729016673.0,ParadiseCA,0,1.0,False

Preference for something around the Morgan, Jefferson, and Dekalb L train stops. But open to Greenpoint, Williamsburg, E. Williamsburg, and Ridgewood. Just need to be close to the L. t b h.  
Budget for the total between us is $2.5k  
Ideally, there's an outdoor space (we like to grill, have fires, and promise we'll contribute to upkeep), mostly an apartment that's a home and we all get along and have a nice time when we're home, a place where we all have can and do friends over (not a party, just like movies dinner BBQs)

We're in our early 30's, overall friendly, cool, and chill people. We like a semi-communal (nothing wild) living, that's why we want to live with others (plus its cheaper). We work full-time jobs (in beer & coffee) and then spend about 60% of our free time at home and 40% out. I'm a native new yorker and he's been here for a long ass time. We're queer and I'm a person of color and would prefer to live with others that share either of those identities. **no shoes in the house.**

so yeah this might be an odd one but hmu if you think its a  good fit \~\*",0,1729016620.0,NYCapartments,0,0.25,False

I also have a 4 year old daughter, her dad is not around. We are currently living together. This is the house breakdown 25M, 24F, 4F, German Shepard Male, German Shepard Female, ball python male, Kenyan sand boa male. Everything in the house is mine as I rented it before he came back into my life. He brought his German Shepard male, 1 recliner, 1 coffee cup, 1 Xbox, 2 shower towels when he moved in plus his clothes and toothbrush. He does pay me $430 a month for his “rent” and he does pay when we go out to eat 85% of the time. He does not cook clean dishes do laundry pick my baby up or take her to school pay WiFi or any other utilities. What started the breakdown was when I asked him to get milk because ours had gone bad and he said you two drink milk I don’t go get it yourself. I have a job opportunity that is 130 miles away. I want to pack all my clothes and my daughters bedroom and my three animals and leave him with all this to pay for an maintain he can keep everything in this place I just want to leave while he’s at work and change my number and never see him again. I’m slowly packing hoping to make my break before Halloween. Any advice is welcome ",0,1729016565.0,relationship_advice,10,0.5,False

I, 21 female, got my friend, 24 female, a job at the company I work for. This job is corporate, high up, professional, and very well paid. I since regretted my decision to get her a job at my place of work since she has made it extremely hard to work with her. 

I am sat on the same pod, on opposite ends, facing each other. We can see each other from where we sit. However, my eyes sometimes wonder from my computer and I catch her looking my way, and she’s instantly trying to talk to me. She has ADHD so I can’t blame her for the next part. She constantly gets up out of her seat to make coffee, to go to the toilet, to speak to people at their desks etc. she’s basically a huge distraction to the whole team. 

To make matters worse, she’s even distracting me. Talking about personal matters on Teams, talking about going out on the weekend on Teams, talking about drugs on Teams and how she “pulled a whitey” ON TEAMS. She asks me to go to the toilet with her when at our desks, she asks me to come to the vending machine. It’s… a lot. 

I don’t want to lose this job, it’s high paying and I’m good at what I do. I’ve just moved out, so I need the money. and I’ve spoken to my manager about how distracting she is when she talks, because once she starts, she won’t stop. My manager is aware about how often she talks, and how distracting she can be, and I’ve gotten into trouble for my work slipping because of her. 

I’m terrified to lose this job because of someone else. But we have been friends for 10 years and I feel bad for thinking this way about her. But I cannot deal with her any longer. 

And I’m not mentioning the fact that she brought snow to a work event, and hid the green lettuce in her bag to work. I’m sick of her. Do I report her even though I’ve been her friend for 10 years and she needs the money? ",1,1729016354.0,WouldIBeTheAhole,1,1.0,False
