1l08x4a,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/1l08x4a/what_stopped_my_sugar_cravings_and_evening_binges/,What stopped my sugar cravings and evening binges,"More of a nutrition-related post, but this is having massive effects in my ability to hit protein goals, track my calories, and make healthier choices.

I want to share what I have recently discovered that made a huge difference in my life. 

Since I was 14 (now 26) I’ve been consuming tons of caffeine. Sure, it was all black coffee and I’d usually stop by 12 or 1 pm, but recently I was forced to reckon with the amount I was drinking and I realized I’ve been consuming at least 600-1000mg every day for the past decade. 

Over 1.5 months I tapered down to 55mg a day, and I was very surprised to see my SUPER INTENSE AND UNCONTROLLABLE sugar cravings and my insatiable appetite decrease massively. I can’t believe I’ve been using caffeine for all these years thinking it suppressed my appetite and helped me barely hang on to the high end of a healthy bmi… 

The reason I decided to examine my caffeine usage was because I took the DUTCH test and found out my dopamine, cortisol, estrogen, and epinephrine were super low. I took the cycle mapping plus test, which tracks all of these throughout an entire month. I believe my high daily caffeine intake used my dopamine up every day, for years, to the point where I was essentially burned out of dopamine. Same with cortisol. I believe that this made me crave sugar in the evenings as my body tried to make up for lost dopamine. 

I think the extreme caffeine usage also tanked the aforementioned hormones, which definitely would affect recovery, body composition, mood, libido, etc. According to my mom, when her estrogen tanked in menopause she began to struggle with weight gain. I felt like I struggled with weight from age 15 on (…one year after starting to drink coffee), but I didn’t have any clue that my estrogen was super low, which lessens feelings of satiety! 

I have tried to track my nutrition many times and always given up days later because of binges so sinful I could not bear to count up the totals. Today marks my seventh day of tracking, and I have not had any processed food or sugar for seven days.

Not saying caffeine is the devil, but if you’re really struggling with self-control or cravings and you drink a lot of coffee, I urge you to consider caffeine’s role in depleting dopamine and spiking blood sugar. 

Also, I have had three surgeries for endometriosis… very interesting, because that is a condition thought to stem from estrogen dominance, and that’s how I assumed my hormones were. ",1,1748729147.0,xxfitness,1,1.0,False

So i will write the name of each class in english then the name in french (if it's not the same name) and why it's called like this.

\- Osamodas -->  if you reverse each letter it becomes sadomaso short of saomasochist i guess because they use a whip.

\- enutrof  -->  reverse each letter it becomes fortune cause they love kamas.

\- xelor  -->  rolex famous watch brand.

\- Ecaflip  -->  pileface in reverse and in english it means headstails as they are always gambling.

\- eniripsa  -->  aspirine famous paracetamol brand

\- cra  -->  arc it's bow in french

\- sadida  -->  adidas i don't know why

\- sacrieur  -->  from sacrifice

\- pandawa  -->  panda but i don't know about the ""wa""

\- rogue  -->  it's roublard in french the name is self explanatory

\- masqueraider -->(zobal in french) i have no idea about the french one

\- foggernaut  -->  steamer in french, steam coming from machine i guess

\- eliotrope  -->  derived from eliAtrope, in reverse it's portail (portal in english)

\- huppermage no idea

\- ouginak  -->  kanigou if i remember it's from canidé (canid in english)

\- feca and sram  -->  café (coffee) and mars on forums there is a rumor that it's coming from a lunch they had at ankama while creating the class but i'm not sure if it's true.

It’s designed to be cozy, calm, and affordable — a place where people can breathe, work, or just enjoy a moment away from the noise.

I’ve spent months planning the concept — from the layout to the suppliers to the atmosphere I want people to feel when they walk in. Now, I’m trying to turn it into a real space. I started a GoFundMe to raise $13,000 to help cover the early-stage costs (licensing, equipment, branding, and space prep).

I’m sharing this here because I know Reddit has a surprisingly supportive side when it comes to small, honest projects — especially ones that come from the heart.

I'm a guy based in Pondicherry, and I’m looking to make a genuine connection — someone to talk to, share random thoughts with, and maybe meet up once in a while for a coffee or a casual hangout.

I’m more into texting, especially since life gets busy, but I’d be happy to catch up in person too if we vibe. I’m not into small talk just for the sake of it — I really value honest, meaningful conversations, and a bit of silly fun too. I love malayalis though. They hold a special place in my heart.

A bit about me: • I do not work 9-6.. • Into movies, Gamer, long walks, binge watching, loves Anime, late-night chats, exploring food joints, and just real convos, • Not looking for romance or anything superficial — just a real, no-drama friendship • Preferably looking to connect with people around the same age 25s & 36s . I do not have any friends who are women so , I would like a one or two female friends too

If you’re also someone who feels like a good friend is hard to come by these days and miss the simplicity of a solid connection, drop me a DM or comment below. Let’s start with a hello and see where it goes.

I quite like the shawarma place on 3rd, but that's about all I'm used to. I carry a pretty heavy backpack and have some leg problems so I can't walk more than about 20 minutes at a time, so I'm basically limited to a certain range around the bus line. I recently found out about both Indi's Chicken and Safier and plan to go there next week for lunch, but what are some other places in this general area that I should keep an eye out for?",4,1748728563.0,Louisville,1,1.0,False
1l08p01,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1l08p01/the_transluminar_ch5/,The Transluminar [Ch.5],"[Prev<<<](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1jr32yx/the\_transluminar/) | [First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1jr32yx/the\_transluminar/)



*Years ago, on a world of green, blue, and silver*

 

‘How did I end up in a place like this?’ is the question I asked myself every day. My parents warned me about them, about everybody else. The human race had gone mad. Why did we go and live up there when we finally fixed our planet? We descended from those fixers, who spent generations raining plastic-eating bacteria down on landfills and breaking down abandoned cities with green goo. Our ancestors elevated our grave to cradle. But the babe is all grown up.

“What are you thinking about, Sage?” Saffron said.

“Just woolgathering, baby sis.” I rubbed her head, messing up those red locks. She never seemed to mind.

“About what?”

“Nothing,” I said. “Nothing at all… Wanna go for a ride?”

“Ooh ooh yes! Let me bring Rosey and Galan too.”

I got up and prepared the buggy while Saffron gathered the siblings. She came back with Rosey, Galan, Cardy, and Rika. Good thing I pre-emptively cleared more seats.

“I call shotgun!” Galan said. He was fiery, as ever, but he knew the difference between ribbing and being mean.

“You can’t say that word!” Cardy said. She was sweet and a stickler for the rules. Though I’ve seen her lie to protect her siblings.

“Quit fighting! Or else no more buggy rides,” Rika said as she climbed in after them. The smallest and the youngest, and possibly the wisest.

Rosey was peering somewhere past the rolling grasses, under the pale blue sky—somewhere only she could see.

“What are you looking at?” I asked.

She shrugged.

“Want to come?” I asked.

She nodded.

We climbed onboard. The buggy’s suspension wobbled under our weight. I checked everyone’s seal belts.

“Ready?” I asked.

“Ready!” Everyone who wasn’t Galan or Rosey said.

“Go already!” was Galan’s reply.

I drove the buggy off the path. We carved through the wind, leaving behind a thin trail of dust. It was a strange to think dust storms used to ravage this land. Nearly two thousand years ago the ancestors farmed the rich soil here for what was considered valuable back then—coffee, acai, sugar cane—replacing the anchoring roots of rainforest with sellable commodity. The soil was allowed to erode. Much of the biodiversity was lost. Some were genetically extrapolated and preserved in gardens. But you couldn’t pick up the pieces of something broken and expect to continue where you left off. There was potential in these lands that would never flower.

“Wow! Look at that!” Saffron said, pointing.

A gleaming diamond was slowly thrusting into the sky, facet upon facet of silver framework and glass. Aeroponic scaffolding were being prepared within—fifty storeys of them, once it was all done.

“There’re building another agricology?” Galan remarked.

“Erde is growing again,” Rika said. “More people are staying than leaving.”

“What’s so good about space anyway,” Galan said. “You burn alive before getting crushed to a paste on Geumseong. And Mars is a crime-ridden hellhole.”

“Galan you owe three EUD to the negativity jar,” Cardy said.

“Nuh-uh, only if you can make me pay.”

I barely noticed them fight. Fighting was good for them anyway. I focused on the dirt road ahead. Warm air swept past the rising sun, billowing, expanding over the pearl white blades of the turbines standing tall over the hills. They could be seen anywhere. They spun and spun, and spun, and spun…

Erde had grown strong. Energy was free. Food nearly grew themselves. Everything worked as it should. There was nothing wrong. I clutched my chest as my spinning thoughts settled to a dead stop.

We had dinner as a family when we returned. I broke the news over the table.

Mother cried.

“What will you do, *filhote*?” She cried.

“You cannot do this to your mother!” Father said. “Or to me! And especially not to your siblings. You are the oldest now. You are…”

Cilan. My older sister. Last we heard she had gone to the city of Monstella, the black jewel of Mars, to make it big. We never heard from her again. And knowing Mars…

“Where will you go?” Mother sobbed. “Not Mars! Anywhere but!”

“What’s wrong with Erde?” Father said. “It was where we were born, as a family, as a species! The *earth* is in our blood, boy. It is where we were watered…”

My siblings cried. Even Galan cried. Galan, who always liked to look tough. Not Rosey though. I remembered her giving me a hug, her big brown eyes capturing my face, in which two points glistened.

“Good luck,” she said.

 

\--

 

*Now*

 

“Perform side-to-side,” Leona said.

“Turning,” Jester said.

The *Chariot* spun around. Then Jester stepped on the pedal. Their drives fired and the acceleration began again, this time in the direction they came from. They would need to keep decelerating all the way to Mercurius.

“Halfway to halfway already,” Sage said.

“Looks who’s up,” Recluse said. “Sweet dreams, kiddo?”

“Not at all,” Sage said. He checked the scopes. “We’re third place?”

“By a hair,” Recluse said. “There’s about fifteen of us up here. The *Lunesilver* is way ahead. The *Wolfram* is second.”

“What’s the plan, then?”

Recluse tilted his head towards the front of the trimaran.

“Hey, flygirl,” Sage called. “Come up with anything?”

“I was hoping my engineer would,” Jester said. “But what I’m thinking is, when we land on Mercurius to pick up the corona shields, someone go and find whichever bay the *Lunesilver* visited to get theirs installed. They would keep diagnostic data on the terminal. We can get an idea of what they’ve got onboard.”

“That’s…”

“What?”

“A good idea,” Recluse interjected. Then he sent a message straight into Sage’s personal comms. The words appeared under his eyes.

*“She’s in a mood.”*

*“Why?”* Sage responded.

*“Don’t know. Suspect it’s family related. She keeps that stuff close to her chest.”*

*“I suppose she would. Didn’t expect her to suggest these kinds of tactics though.”*

Recluse’s eyes bulged.

*“That’s what I mean! She’s always been the purest of us. No weaponry, no backroom deals, all drive. Something’s changed over the course of this race.”*

*“The Transluminar changes us all,”* Sage noted.

*“What the corny ass- shut the fuck up.”*

Sage chuckled.

“If you’re done passing notes,” Jester said, “We’ve got company. Starboard.”

Sage rushed to the scopes.

Exhaust tails descended past them on the starboard scope. A trimaran lowered into view. An incoming comms alert beeped.

“The *Nemean Lion*,” Sage said. “Let’s see what they want.”

The glaring face of a man appeared on their screens in pale color. Two scars marked his cheek. Another across his forehead. A cybernetic eye glinted red in one of his sockets.

“Good evening,” he said. “I’m Borjio.”

“And…?” Sage said.

“Right to it then.” Borjio pulled on the collar of his suit; it was tight around his neck. “We both have two problems that are ahead of us at this very moment. I propose a joint venture between us and two other teams that I have managed to convince. Interested?”

“And what would that involve?” Sage asked.

Borjio chuckled.

“You have one minute to discuss amongst yourselves,” he said. “I await your favorable response.”

The connection was severed. His face dissolved.

“So, what are we thinking guys?” Sage asked.

“No need to think,” Recluse said. “Pretty sure I recognize that guy from Olympus News. He’s a criminal. Death row. Winning is the only way he’s living.”

“Oh, right,” Leona muttered nervously. “I-I don’t know about working with him. He’s going to stab us-”

“What do you think, Jester?” Sage said. “I think he’s going to stab us in the back the moment he doesn’t need us anymore.”

“Let’s hear him out,” Jester said.

Their time was up. They were hailed again.

“Well?” Borjio said.

“We accept,” Jester said. “What’s the plan?”

Borjio smiled.

“I am very pleased. You won’t regret this.”

Sage and Recluse exchanged looks.",2,1748728545.0,HFY,2,1.0,False
1l08opy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC/comments/1l08opy/aita_for_refusing_to_join_my_coworkers_mandatory/,"AITA for refusing to join my coworkers' ""mandatory fun"" after work because I just want to go home and chill?","I (26M) just started this new job a few months ago, and overall, it’s pretty chill. Great pay, decent people, nothing to complain about. But there’s this one thing that’s been bugging me.

Every Friday after work, a group of coworkers goes out for what they call “mandatory fun.” Yeah, mandatory *fun.* Apparently, it’s some sort of unspoken rule that if you want to be part of the team, you gotta come. They usually hit up a bar, play pool, drink a bit, and just hang out.

Now, I’m *not* an anti-social weirdo. I like people and all but after a full week of work, the last thing I want to do is spend two hours pretending to be the life of the party while my brain is screaming “Netflix and pizza.” I’m an introvert at heart, and my social battery runs out faster than my phone on 1%. So when they invited me last Friday, I politely said I’d pass and just wanted to head home and relax.

Cue the awkward stares and the “aw, come on, don’t be lame” comments. One of the guys even joked, “You’re gonna be known as the office hermit now.” Ha. Ha. Not. But whatever, I thought, maybe next week I’ll go.

Next Friday rolls around, same thing. I say no again. This time I get a bit more pushback. Someone said, “It’s about team bonding, bro.” I get it, but can bonding not involve just a casual lunch or grabbing coffee during the day? Apparently not.

Here’s the kicker: I overheard a few coworkers saying I’m “killing the vibe” by not showing up. Like, come on, I’m just trying to keep my sanity here.

1l08obm,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChristian/comments/1l08obm/gender_roles_and_the_feminism_problem_from_the/,"Gender roles and the ""feminism problem"", from the POV of a feminist woman","Recently, I came across a couple of posts on gender roles that contained a lot of responses that I found to be very upsetting.  I want to have a different sort of conversation about that.

A lot of focus seems to be aimed at putting the blame of weakening traditional Biblical gender roles at the feet of *feminism*.  One particular comment even stated that women's rights issues were all solved back in the 1970's, and in my experience, this is a very common outlook within the broader Christian community.

The second issue was that people -- particularly those who appeared to be men -- did not really understand why posts on the Biblical expectations of men vs women tended to be way more reactive when they were concerning women.

SORRY FOR THE LONG POST.  I JUST NEEDED TO GET THESE THOUGHTS OFF MY CHEST.



# Societal Sexism

So I'm going to come out the gate here and address why feminism is not 'evil' or bad, and it is very much still needed in our society -- both secular AND Christian.  I am going to tell you about MY experiences.  This is a long share, you don't have to read it, but it will give you insight on where my opinions come from.

>I was raised in a heavily Christian community in Louisiana.

>As a kid, I was relegated to activities that never suited my interests.  I was *very* ""high IQ"" (think MENSA), and it was difficult for me to handle my frustration for why I was stuck making Yet Another Spoon Santa at the glitter table when Tom and Harry got to go on scout trips, going to cool parks, seeing animals, visiting science exhibits, and being taught to hunt.

>As a teenager, I was **forced** to take two years of home economics and family planning in high school for no other reason than ""is girl"", while boys were given the choice of choosing a science or history elective or going to shop/mechanics or a skills class, or taking home ec themselves.  This was in the 2000's, not the 1970's.  I did not learn a single skill from these classes, because all of the equipment had been condemned *since the 1940's*.  And that shop class?  Girls were not permitted at all, *because we might hurt ourselves*.  I was going to be forced into a third year of family planning, but after weeks of throwing public fits, I was finally allowed to take world history instead.    
  
There was INTENSE pushback against me because ""*Oh, but girls should be focused on being mommies!  It's so precious!*""

>Adulthood was no better for me.  I thought working for Christian businesses would be wholesome.  It wasn't.  I had to fight for every scrap I got, and I was ALWAYS the one employee who automatically was assigned to cleaning bathrooms, making sure coffee was available (I didn't even drink coffee!), and taking out the trash because that's ""women's work.""  And before anyone suggests it, I was NOT hired to do those things, and it was objectively unfair that nobody else with the same job title was expected to do these things so long as they were male.    
  
Across 5 Christian employers, I was told that I could not be given PTO because I was already a risk to businesses as I had a uterus and could get pregnant at any time and then I'd want more time off.  (Yes, this is a real argument I was given, multiple times.)  I was paid $10/hr in the 2010's to be a cable puller, a punchdown tech, an SME capable of maintaining archaic analog PBX systems, a solutions architect, a marketer, a process manager, technical trainer, and I was single-handedly building and operating a 30,000 SKU Magento website -- all at the same time.    
  
*Oh, but I shouldn't be paid more -- my work was VERY unlady-like, and what I really needed was a husband, not more money.  Women shouldn't have to support themselves.*

>Actual things said to my face when I argued for raises.

>I did not escape this cycle of poverty until I quit trying to appease Christian business owners and instead snagged a corporate job with an organization that did not tolerate religious and sexist behavior in the workplace.

**TLDR:**  I have a lifetime of experience that tells me that women's equality was never solved.  Things may be EASIER than in the 1940's for women, but we are not yet equal, respected, or valued, *especially* amongst Christians.

The cherry on the pie?  Women's rights are now actively backsliding, in large part due to *Christians*, and no one else.  When JD Vance, a Christian, decided to describe older single childless women -- you know, like myself -- as useless and pitiful, it started a wave of hateful, mean comments that I *still* hear being repeated by my Christian neighbors.  Why am I hearing an explosion of people, **including on this sub!**, suggesting that women maybe *shouldn't* be able to own bank accounts or take out loans without a male co-signer? 

Do you know how awful it feels to be proud of your life and your accomplishments, but suddenly your community -- your Christian community that you are supposed to trust -- now just thinks you're useless garbage dragging on society?

I am an adult human being that has never broken any laws; I pay my mortgage on my own and take care of my aging parents.  I've lived a Christian life; I'm even celibate, still waiting on marriage, but apparently maybe I shouldn't have done that after all since my value to society has been rendered down to the number of babies I should have produced instead.

**Feminism is still required.**  



# What's Wrong with Gender Roles

Okay, meat and potatoes.

The Biblical description of the role of men is *largely* a laundry list of traits that apply equally to all human beings in order to be considered a good person.  Compassionate? Kind? Gentle? Respectful?

Quite literally, Biblical men are called to do the absolute bare minimum of being a civil human being.

*But techleopard, that's not ALL they're called to do!*  Sure, they have other expectations -- but almost every single checkbox on the list of Biblical Manhood deals with men being in a position of power over women, or taking on responsibilities **that are no longer relevant or required in modern society.**  

We don't need men pushing backbreaking plows in fields anymore, when women are perfectly capable of driving tractors.  I don't need a husband who can swing a club or sword to protect the home when I've got a 12 gauge.  Most people are not being conscripted to war every other year, nor are men needed to make grueling treks into the city for supplies when we've all got cars and trucks.  I don't even need a man to hammer nails, because that's what the air compressor and nailgun are for.

Even when it comes to providing for the household, women have the capacity to earn the same or more money (when paid fairly), and our society is such now that most working class homes REQUIRE both spouses to be working.

**So how does this translate in modern times?**

What I see going on in my peers' ""traditional"" Christian households *breaks my heart*.

Women have all of these servile responsibilities put on them -- things that are all still relevant today as they were in the days of Jesus -- but now they are also shouldering more responsibilities that were once the purview of men, because society demands that of them.  At the same time, their physical pain and mental health is still largely ignored or belittled.

Men come home from a 8-to-5 and plop down in front of the television or go straight to the bedroom to play on their phones, and proceed to vegetate until somebody makes their dinner plate for them.  They get upset if asked to take on household chores or help with children, because that's ""not my job.""  Nevermind the woman *also* just got home from work.  

Then when women get sick of this, the church community turns on them.  They get reminded that they're called to serve their husbands.  Divorce is a sin.  They're acting shamefully.  

Meanwhile, the men are put on pedestals and gathered around and told it isn't their fault.

I'm not saying ALL men do this, but I am saying an extremely uncomfortable number of Christian men ARE doing this, right now.  And this isn't a ""single bad church"", this is many.

I just let a woman and her kids move into my house whose husband was just arrested for contact with minors; he even had the gall to blame it on HER for not giving him ""enough attention.""  The church?  *Pretending she didn't exist.*



# Many women would love traditional roles.

This is the biggest thing that I wish church communities would understand.

Women don't just decide they want to ""live in sin"" or whatever.  Feminists are not evil, man-hating people who are just jealous of ""tradwives"" on the internet.  

Women are not leaving churches in droves because we're all just influenced by demons.

We just want happy, calm, stable, love-filled lives.  We want to be able to experience new things and to be able to enjoy the things we actually like, the same as our husbands.  We want the freedom to decide who we can be friends with and where we live.  We want the power to take care of OUR parents and extended families, not just the husband's.  We want time to ourselves and the same courtesy of having that time respected that we are expected to give to men.

We NEED independence.  We NEED to fight traditional gender roles.  We NEED to be careful and untrusting of Christian men.

Why?

**Because your typical church community is NOT a safe place for women, and there is often very little effort being made to actually change that.**  

Sermons focus on repeating Bible verses over and over and over on what gender roles should be, as if telling women they should serve their husbands and men should take up the role of being the man of the house is *actually* going to solve the problem of how those things are now misconstrued and dangerous to women.

Meanwhile, there is pressure to get young girls married quickly, while boys are often still counseled to get a trade/go to school first.  The number of Christian leaders and influencers who have recently begun to use the word ""ripe"" to describe young girls is gag-inducing, and I have yet to hear a single word uttered by a pastor condemning this.

The Christian community loves to talk about what ""should be"" while ignoring ""what is.""

Rampant sexism within the church means that if ANYTHING goes bad within a relationship, it's going to be the woman's fault, and the consequences for women are so much steeper than the ones for men when anyone ""messes up.""  (When a pregnant teen pops up, who do you think is more likely to be thrown out of the house and shamed?  Hint:  It ain't the boy.)

When a man decides he wants a divorce so he can trade up to a younger model wife, nobody bats an eye.  In fact, Christians are the largest demographic wanting to eliminate *child support* and *alimony*, because these two things give women too much financial freedom if they decide to leave first.

  
**Point is:**  If you want a return to traditional roles in the home, you have to focus on addressing why those roles are now viewed as unsafe and high risk for women.  NOT just try to look for ways to just corral women into those roles and forcefully make them accept that life.

Can you guess my inspirations? Looking for serious critiques and suggestions/feedback.,"This is the prologue and the first 2 chapters. Both very rough drafts. it has taken me an embarrassingly long time to get to this point. 



Prologue

The mother was still screaming upstairs when Yona made the first cut.

The cellar was too hot for October. Sweat collected on the bridge of her nose and clung there, sharp and oily. Her dress stuck to her spine. The baby’s skin was slick, impossibly soft, still steaming from birth.

The blade didn’t tremble.

She’d salted the floor three nights earlier. Burned the thread down to ash and ground the bones by hand. She had done the math. Marked the moon. Starved herself. Planned it exactly.

The child twitched as the knife kissed the base of her skull just beneath the hairline, just deep enough. A thin red line welled and broke. Blood slid down her fingers and beaded on the floor. The baby didn’t cry.

The second child was louder.

He writhed in her arms as she placed him in the circle. Salt stuck to her shoes. The air in the cellar thick with flies. Upstairs, sobs twisted into something hollow and feral, more animal than human.

Yona didn’t look back.

She cut him the same way.  


By the time she cleaned the blood from her hands, the mother had gone still. Not dead. Not yet. But drained, like something poured out of her that wouldn’t return.

Yona sealed the house.  
She told the town they were stillborn.  
She told herself it was mercy.

In the orchard, black blossoms bloomed overnight. The fruit split open before it ripened. The trees wept something thick and dark into the soil. The sky smelled like vinegar.

And just before dawn, two unmarked cars arrived in the rain.

No headlights. No words.   
One driver was a woman with white gloves. The other didn’t take off his sunglasses, even indoors.  
Yona didn’t ask for names.  
They didn’t offer them.

They took the children without ceremony—one swaddled in a navy blanket, the other in pale green.  

When the door shut behind them, Yona sat on the kitchen floor and waited for morning. No tears filled her eyes. 

The stove ticked.  
The cellar breathed.  
And far away, in places that didn’t yet know their names, the children began to dream.

""This is the way it has to be.""





chapter 1



Mornings smelled like brine and mildew. And sometimes—if the wind came in off the sea just right—rot. Like the inside of a sealed jar.

Lomia hated mornings.

The kettle hadn’t finished boiling when the egg bled. Not metaphorically. The yolk was red, thick as old cough syrup, and clotted like a wound. Second time this week. She didn’t flinch. Just scraped it into the bin and lit a cigarette off the stove burner. Morag would have said something if she still spoke.

Outside, the ocean screamed against the cliffs.  
Inside, silence clung to her skin like static cling.

She didn’t know how to describe what was happening to her, not in words people took seriously. Every mirror in the cottage lagged—half a second behind her movements, like she was watching someone else practice being her. She’d wake most nights with her jaw locked and her mouth dry, like she’d been swallowing something that fought back.

Her ears rang constantly. Her spine ached like something small and hungry lived between her vertebrae.

The drawer in the hallway had started smelling sweet. She checked it anyway. Pulled out a pair of socks and felt something hard roll across her palm.

A tooth.  
Human, probably. Not hers. No blood, no root. Just there.

She didn’t scream. She just pocketed it. Like you do.

The phone didn’t work anymore. The SIM card kept unrecognizing itself.  
The neighbors stopped waving after the cat disappeared.  
Even the gulls kept their distance now. Like they knew.

Morag had gone quiet last week. Just brewed things. Smoked things. Stirred powders in chipped bowls and whispered over jars like the air itself might betray them. She didn’t look Lomia in the eye anymore.

Then came the knock.

Lomia opened the door and found an envelope on the step—thick paper, no postmark, her name in handwritten ink. No return address.

Inside:  
– A deed.  
– A town she’d never heard of: Grayer Hollow.  
– And a name she couldn’t say aloud without her tongue going numb:  
**Yona Karroway.**

On the inside flap, under the crease where fingers had once folded it shut, something handwritten:

“There’s something under the house. I think it’s me.”

And somewhere out on the water, the ocean paused.

The wind stopped.

Everything smelled like vinegar and overripe apples





*chapter 2*



Erling’s apartment smelled like old screen heat, plastic, and failure.

Not rot. Not mildew. Nothing gothic. Just the dry, synthetic aftertaste of power cords and overworked fans. The kind of place where your skin dries out and you forget what trees feel like.

He liked it that way.

Minimal light. No clutter. White walls, white noise.  
A city where no one cared who you were unless you owed them money or were standing in the way.

He worked nights doing data entry for a firm that watched people for profit. Not tech support. Not surveillance. Something more abstract. Numbers about numbers. Behavior clusters. Risk flagging. He didn’t need to know why or who — just tag patterns and feed them upstream.

Twelve floors up. No open windows. The elevator groaned. The radiator stuttered.  
Every morning, his nose bled.

Always the same routine:  
Wake up. Blood.  
Shower. Blood in the drain.  
Make coffee. Smell of pennies and rust.  
Try not to remember the dream.

The dream had trees in it. Trees that breathed like lungs. A basin full of something pulsing. A cradle on fire. And hands. A woman’s hands smeared in something black that made his jaw ache.

The coffee never helped.

His body was doing things it didn’t ask permission for. Waking up with soil under his nails. Dirt in his sheets. Bruises on the insides of his wrists like restraints, but no bedposts.

He’d tried to record himself sleeping once.  
The camera froze at 2:47 a.m.  
When it came back on, he was sitting up. Smiling.

He deleted the footage.

The day the envelope came, Erling was on the subway, watching a man across from him scratch his chest for six stops straight. Same spot. Same rhythm.  
He blinked too hard.  
Muttered things only he could hear.  
Erling didn’t mean to stare, but something about the repetition felt… off.  
Like the man was caught in a loop he didn’t know he was in.

When the train screeched to a halt, the man didn’t move.  
Just blinked. Scratched. Whispered.  
As Erling stepped off, he looked back.  
The man was staring right at him.  
Mouth moving, but no sound.  
Like maybe he’d been speaking to Erling the whole time.

By the time he reached his street, Erling’s palms were damp.  
His mouth tasted like metal.  
He couldn’t shake the feeling he’d brought something home with him.

When he got there, the envelope was already waiting, wedged in the doorframe like it had tried to let itself.

 No one ever sent him anything. His name didn’t even show up on a lease. The apartment belonged to the company.

The envelope was thick. Heavy. Cream-colored stock with real ink. No return address. Just *Erling Exum*, written in handwriting he didn’t recognize, but somehow knew.

Inside:  
 A deed.  
A crude, hand-drawn map.  
A name: Yona Karroway.  
A sticky note with four words:

“The Hollow is home.”

His brain buzzed as the light overhead swayed.  
The room tilted, just slightly at first, then harder.  
He steadied himself against the table.  
And then blood hit the paper.  
Fast.  
Too fast.

His nose didn’t just bleed, it poured. Fat drops soaking the corner of the map, blooming over “Grayer Hollow” like something organic.

He pressed the back of his hand to his face. Stumbled into the kitchen.  
The hum didn’t stop.

Somewhere deep inside him, a voice — maybe his — whispered:

“It's under the floor.”

He didn’t want to know what that meant.

He folded the map. Kept the deed. Cleaned the blood.

But that night, he pulled out the camera again. Just in case",1,1748728426.0,KeepWriting,0,1.0,False

# Best Water Filter That Eliminates Fluoride [2025 Guide]

The presence of fluoride in municipal water supplies has been a topic of debate for decades. While proponents argue for its benefits in dental health,many individuals seek to avoid fluoride consumption due to personal beliefs,health concerns,or specific medical conditions. Choosing the right water filter that effectively removes fluoride is crucial for those seeking fluoride-free water. This guide explores the best water filters for eliminating fluoride in 2025, considering factors like effectiveness, cost, ease of use, and overall value.

[[explore Top Rated water filter that eliminates fluoride on Amazon.]](https://site.vrmemes.com/clearance-products/?kw=water filter that eliminates fluoride)

## Key Features Analysis

The effectiveness of a water filter in removing fluoride depends on several key features and technological aspects. Understanding these aspects is crucial to selecting the right filter for your needs.

**Filtration Technology:** The most effective fluoride removal filters utilize activated alumina, reverse osmosis, or distillation. Activated alumina works by adsorption, attracting and binding fluoride ions to its surface. Reverse osmosis uses pressure to force water through a semi-permeable membrane, blocking fluoride and other contaminants. Distillation involves boiling water and collecting the steam, leaving fluoride and other non-volatile substances behind. The choice of technology determines the filter's effectiveness and cost.

Activated alumina is a filtration method that uses a substrate to actively and effectively bind to fluoride molecules as water passes through the filter. This type of filtration is a popular method of fluoride removal, and is usually more cost effective than reverse osmosis filtration. The life span of filters with this technology is limited, however, and can require replacing more ofen depending on need.

**Filter Capacity and Lifespan:** Filter capacity refers to the amount of water a filter can effectively treat before it needs replacement. Lifespan is the duration for which the filter maintains its fluoride removal effectiveness. Higher capacity filters offer convenience and reduce the frequency of replacements, while a longer lifespan translates to lower long-term costs. It's essential to consider your household's water consumption when choosing a filter with an appropriate capacity and lifespan.

Filter certifications are very meaningful as the overall safety and health of your drinking water is the primary purpose of their development. Certain filters are able to provide clean, potable water without needing to frequently be replaced. Ensure your filter choice is able to uphold its filtration standards and last a reasonable amount of time.

**Flow Rate:** The flow rate indicates how quickly the filter can dispense purified water. A higher flow rate ensures a steady supply,which is particularly important for busy households or individuals who use filtered water extensively for cooking and drinking. A slow flow rate can be inconvenient and may require additional storage of filtered water.

The speed in which a filter is able to work is crucial for a quality and long-lasting machine. Many water filters will be able to provide a satisfying amount of water for your daily activities; however, some filters fall behind in this department. Ensure the filter you choose can reliably provide enough water for your usage.

**Installation and Maintenance:** The ease of installation and maintenance considerably affects the user experience. Some filters require professional installation,while others can be easily installed by the user. Regular maintenance, such as filter replacement and cleaning, is necessary to maintain optimal performance. Consider filters that offer straightforward installation processes and simple maintenance procedures.

Properly maintaining your filter is imperative for it to be able to uphold its filtration and safety standards.Different companies and filter types will require different amounts of maintenance and upkeep, and must be followed to avoid potential complications such as unsanitary water and bacteria buildup.

**Certifications:** Independent certifications from organizations like NSF International demonstrate that the filter meets specific performance standards for reducing fluoride and other contaminants. these certifications provide assurance of the filter's effectiveness and safety. Look for filters with NSF certifications for fluoride reduction to ensure they meet industry standards.Validating your filter with independent organizations such as NSF ensures your filter is working properly and providing safe water. If there are no certifications of standard, it can indicate a lesser-quality filter.

**Water Quality Testing:** Even though manufacturers stand by and test their products, it is indeed impossible to truly know your filter is operating to standard without testing your water as well. Purchasing testing kits can provide insight as to whether your water is indeed safe, and provide insight into the filter's effectiveness over time.

## Core benefits

Choosing a water filter that eliminates fluoride offers several significant benefits, ranging from improved health to enhanced convenience.**reduced Fluoride Intake:** The primary benefit is the reduction of fluoride intake, which can be particularly important for individuals with sensitivities, allergies, or concerns about potential long-term health effects. Eliminating fluoride from drinking water provides peace of mind for those seeking to control their exposure to this additive.

Reducing one's intake of fluoride comes with plenty of reasons; some people prefer to avoid fluoride for medical reason, while others are simply not a fan of the taste.Choosing to mitigate fluoride intake can allow consumers to have better autonomy and control over what they put into their bodies.**Improved Water Taste and odor:** Activated carbon filters, often used in conjunction with fluoride removal technologies, can improve the taste and odor of water by removing chlorine, sediment, and other impurities. Filtered water is often more palatable and enjoyable to drink, encouraging better hydration.

Drinking clean and clarified water is essential for daily life and hydration.Using a water filter that can provide better tasting and smelling water has benefits, even outside of pure fluoride reduction; drinking water is essential to life, and therefore must have certain qualities.

**Enhanced Appliance Lifespan:** Filtering water reduces the buildup of scale and mineral deposits in appliances like coffee makers, kettles, and humidifiers. Using filtered water can prolong the lifespan of these appliances by preventing corrosion and maintaining optimal performance.

Using pure water for your appliances keeps them clean from buildup and allows for better function. Over time, the life spans of your appliances can indeed increase as of your quality filter.**Healthier Baby Formula:** When preparing baby formula, it's essential to use water that is free from contaminants like fluoride. Water filters designed to remove fluoride provide a safer and healthier option for mixing formula, ensuring the baby receives the purest possible nourishment.Providing quality water for infants is incredibly critically important for a developing child's health.The benefits of using a fluoride filter in this aspect include mitigating any fluoride side effects in children, and providing them with the cleanest and purest standard of water possible.

**Cost Savings on Bottled Water:** Investing in a water filter that eliminates fluoride can significantly reduce the need to purchase bottled water,leading to long-term cost savings. Over time, the cost of the filter is offset by the savings on bottled water, making it a more economical and environmentally friendly option.

Most people choose bottled water to avoid the impurities of tap water; however, that is not the only way to avoid drinking contaminated water. Investing in a solid water filter guarantees the safety and quality of water from the tap, and saves on bottled water costs over time.

## FAQs Section

Here are answers to some common questions about water filters that eliminate fluoride.

**Are all water filters effective at removing fluoride?**
No, not all water filters are effective at removing fluoride. Standard carbon filters typically do not remove fluoride. The most effective filters for fluoride removal are those that utilize activated alumina, reverse osmosis, or distillation technologies. Ensure that the filter is specifically designed and certified for fluoride reduction.

**How frequently enough should I replace the filter cartridge?**
The frequency of filter cartridge replacement depends on the filter type, water usage, and water quality. Check the manufacturer's recommendations for specific replacement intervals. Regularly replacing the filter cartridge ensures optimal fluoride removal and prevents the buildup of contaminants.**Can these filters remove other contaminants besides fluoride?**
Yes, many water filters that remove fluoride can also remove other contaminants such as chlorine, lead, pesticides, and bacteria. Reverse osmosis filters, in particular, are capable of removing a wide range of impurities, providing extensive water purification. Be sure to check the filter's specifications to determine its full range of contaminant removal capabilities.

**what if the water tastes different after using a fluoride filter?**
Some users may notice a slightly different taste after using a fluoride filter. This can be due to the removal of other minerals and chemicals along with fluoride. The taste should be clean and fresh. If the water has an unusual or unpleasant taste, it may indicate a problem with the filter or water source. In such cases, consult the manufacturer's instructions or consider having the water tested.

1l08ja4,https://www.reddit.com/r/StartUpIndia/comments/1l08ja4/a_premium_cigarette_bar/,A premium cigarette bar,"Recently, I was at a coffee shop. It had a glass window through which I could see outside. 

I saw bunch of guys standing at this Sutta Tapri smoking, and talking to each other for 30-45 minutes, in the duration, they smoked like 3 to 4 cigarettes each. 

I thing I could see was most of them wanted to sit somewhere, but didn’t have a good spot. 

So in my head, the only thing I could think of was how whenever you go to a fancy restaurant and order some wine, they do all that blah blah bullshit before letting you taste it. I was thinking maybe something similar, but for cigarettes because I realised ever since I started smoking imported cigarettes like Camel Blue, Marlboro Red, etc going back to normal Indian made cigarettes is a little difficult because the taste is not the same and the imported ciggs smell so good.

Was thinking, maybe we build an experienced centre for cigarettes which is not too expensive and has like a entry fee like BYOBs folks can just hang out there and just chat about anything with good lighting and atmosphere and have sort of like a personal server who would assist them with their cigarettes or anything. 

This round office complex would be crazy. I’m not talking about smoking rooms here. I’m talking about an experience Centre for smokers. Maybe they have like a membership or anything I don’t know. 

I am not sure if this is something someone already doing had it in my head, thought it was a cool concept. Would love to get roasted for it.

1l08hl1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1l08hl1/met_the_founder_of_plaid/,Met the founder of Plaid,"I can't stop thinking about when I met the founder of Plaid a few years back...


He was definitely not like I imagined a billionaire founder will be, I met him before the acquisition (3.5b). Looking back now, I am not surprised he sold (didn't understand it at the time tho).


First of all, the story wasn't at all what you expect it to be. He along with 2 cofounders (I think) had only $10k in the bank, no funding no nothing. They were going to fundraise but then (at a rare moment of clarity) asked themselves ""do we even need the money to build this"", all of them were very young & they had a deal with a friend to sleep in his living room for %5. 


So they decided to do it without VC money & ration that 10 thousand for a couple of year. They knew they like to build financial infastructure software but didn't know what to build exactly. Back then there were no unified bank APIs, and it felt impossible for someone to even attempt to do that (does require to deals directly with banks not just code). 


But they just liked working on it. Keep at it for 3 straight years (I can't even imagine how hard that integration would have been, especially with the legacy software and mindset of those dinosaurs).


All of that focus was amazing, but what shocked me the most is the look at the founder's face when I met him, it was after they they reached unicorn status but before the sale. That look was something like ""I just wanna sit alone in a room and code all day again"", he even said it outloud ""I am tired of managing all these people"". Later he left and went to a coffee shop nearby to work, he didnt comeback until the morning.



The work ethic is incredible, but that is not what stuck in my mind. What I never imagined to be true is he just wanted to build stuff. It wasn't the power nor the money that motivated them. Not even the glamour of being the first API to connect to all banks in America (he couldn't wait to finish with the press stuff and go back to their laptops).",1,1748727996.0,Entrepreneur,1,0.67,False

📜 The Chronicles of Ilyas_7: My Encounter With the Four Horsemen of Haqq

I write this not for clout , for I need none,  but so the story may live on.

The day I met the Four Horsemen of Haqq was the day I stopped believing Reddit was just a place for karma farmers and microwave chefs. No. There were giants walking among us. And I had found them.

🏰 1. KinginBlack — The Architect in the Mansion of Silence

I met him in a high-ceiling mansion, tucked away in the shadowy corners of a digital domain known only to the faithful. The doorman said nothing. The halls echoed with silence. I was led to a room with one chair, one rug, and him — KIB — seated like a man who had never once doubted his path.

He didn't look up when I entered. He was scrolling.

> “You’re Ilyas_7,” he said flatly, like he already knew everything.

I nodded.

> “You want to help TrueDeen.”

Another nod.

He finally looked at me. Eyes like someone who had seen 500 karma-brigade attempts and didn’t flinch once. He didn’t smile. He didn’t nod. He just said:

> “Then don’t waste time. We moderate. We don’t whine.”

Before I could respond, the lights dimmed, and he was gone. Probably logged off. Probably banned someone mid-sentence.

☕ 2. Tuttelut — The Chill Executioner at the Café of No Returns

We met at a small, offbeat café. I arrived tense — expecting war council energy. Instead, I saw him by the window, in a hoodie, sipping hot chocolate and scrolling casually.

“Yo,” he said. “You’re that guy who got banned thrice, right? Respect.”

I sat. He slid me a cinnamon bun without breaking eye contact with his phone. I thought this was a peace offering. Then he casually muttered:

> “You see that user who said hijab is a colonial construct?”
click
“Yeah, they’re banned.”

He sipped again.

Tuttelut was ruthless, but you’d never know unless you watched him work. There were no speeches. No grand moves. He just operated with the smoothness of a trained ninja who also ran a meme page.

He leaned back, looking almost apologetic.

> “People think I’m power tripping. Bro I’m just trying to make the subreddit suck less.”

And in that moment, I understood: this was the relatable warlord — someone who didn’t mod from a throne, but from the trenches. With AirPods in.

🎒 3. Altro — The Strategist on the Rooftop

Altro didn’t want to meet in a room. He picked a rooftop. Why? “Good view for thinking,” he said.

He greeted me like we’d known each other for years. Hoodie. Backpack. Slight grin like he was already predicting my next three questions.

> “You’re trying to fix the Muslim Reddit scene, huh? Cool. So’s everyone. But we do it smart.”

He laid out a napkin and literally started drawing a chart using sugar packets and coffee stirrers.

Altro wasn’t robotic or uptight. He was casually brilliant. Like someone who doesn’t study but still aces the exam.

> “We don’t need drama. We need structure. Give people clarity, consistency, and a place where nonsense gets filtered. That’s how we win.”

And he spoke like this while also recommending me a solid indie game on Steam. Bro was dropping subreddit strategy while showing me memes.

He wasn’t intense. He was just... prepared. Seasoned. Like he’d survived 10 failed Muslim subs and came out smarter every time.

Before I left, he patted my shoulder.

> “You’re passionate. That’s cool. Now sharpen it.”

🧠 4. Beautiful_Clock — The Philosopher in the Library With a Ban Button

I almost didn’t notice him at first. We were supposed to meet at an old digital archive. I found him sitting by the ""Reported Posts"" section, reading quietly while chaos unfolded in a nearby thread.

I sat.

He didn’t look up.

After five minutes, he closed the thread he was reading and said:

> “The problem with most subreddits is they fear clarity. They think diplomacy is moderation. It’s not.

Clock wasn’t flashy. He wasn’t loud. But every word carried weight, like it had been tested in a Reddit lab and purified down to truth.

> “We don’t moderate to win arguments. We moderate to prevent stupidity from becoming normal.”

And then he just... stood up and walked over to a thread about “modern reinterpretations of Islamic masculinity,” left a surgical comment that dismantled all 15 takes in two paragraphs, and walked back like nothing happened.

Clock wasn’t just a thinker — he was a precision strike.

He doesn’t speak often. But when he does, entire threads realign.

🌌 Final Reflections

Meeting them changed me.

I came to support a cause. I left understanding a movement.

Each one different — KIB’s silence, Tuttelut’s casual justice, Altro’s smooth tactics, and Clock’s surgical insight — but together they were more than mods. They were the defenders of sanity in an online world teetering between nonsense and nuance.

And I? I was just Ilyas_7. 

And this is the beginning of my book:

I started spotting brownish pink on Thursday 5/22. I called my OB office and they said it’s normal in early pregnancy and to just monitor it. Then on Sunday 5/25, I woke up at 6 am in extreme pain, almost like labor. I went to the ER, was not bleeding much. They did transvaginal ultrasound to make sure it wasn’t ectopic, but couldn’t locate a pregnancy at all. Did some blood work and my HCG was a little over 1500. They sent me home and I came back in later that night because the pain changed and I started bleeding a little. Bleeding had subsided while I was there but HCG levels dropped to 1043. They said I was likely miscarrying and sent me home to do more labs on Tuesday 5/27. Those labs showed my HCG at barely over 300. I started spotting brown coffee grounds almost. I had a follow up on Thursday 5/29 and OB prescribed me some birth control (I don’t desire to be pregnant again) and when I asked if I needed any imaging or D&C, she said no. I asked what to expect for bleeding and she said it can pick up off and on. I came home to my dog actively passing away and stopped giving a shit about what was going on with me.

Bleeding started to pick up yesterday 5/30 and I thought it would just be that. But then at 8AM today, I passed some sort of UNGODLY blob of jelly and tissue like substance. I called the on call nurse line and they didn’t seem concerned and told me to come in if I start passing clots the size of a lemon or start soaking an overnight pad an hour for 2 hours straight.

I’m assuming I passed the pregnancy? I don’t know. They couldn’t find anything on ultrasound last weekend, so I didn’t even know what to expect. No one told me I could pass anything like what I saw this morning.

Do I need to go to the hospital? Do I need to have an ultrasound? Do I need a D&C? Will I pass this naturally? What else is coming? With it being the weekend, my OB obviously isn’t open, and I’m supposed to be out of town Monday for the day for a work meeting.

So to make this short, she had an incredible busy week, and I didn't hear from her for a couple days.  No big deal, I didn't message bomb her.  She responded on Tuesday, and we chatted a bit and agreed later in the week would work. I let her know I understood and told her there was no pressure, I'd be here whenever.  We never settled on a day, and on Wed (her last message) was pleasant and we aimed for the weekend.  
I responded Wed night.  Didn't get a response Thursday, but knew she was still very busy. Friday, I sent her a simple, gm happy Friday, no response.  Today, nothing.  I went to message her and her chat was gone.....

He told me how his gaming console growing up would be shipped off while he was in school because his cousins “ needed it more”I took that statement very hard since I HATE when people mess with my stuff due to how I was raised so I’m very sensitive to these things , I labeled everything with my name / bright neon orange duck tape and I place little cartoon frog stickers on everything even food I buy and condiments. Me and my husband placed the LABELED bag of plushies on top of our dog’s cage in the laundry room since we didn’t have space in our room it went along with my coffee table and a couple of other boxes , yesterday I was going to do laundry as my husband went to go play marvel rivals with his friend  right after dinner. As I’m in the laundry room I think to my self why not take out one of my children and cuddle with them in a folding chair while I wait for laundry to be done so I can put the next load as I’m watching a Chinese drama. I go look on top  of the cage and I don’t see the bag I didn’t see anything wrong with it I thought to myself maybe they placed it along in the corner of the garage where my boxes and other things were at .  I go check don’t see anything. I then get this sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach I slowly start hyperventilating and I can feel my pulse going faster  I start freaking out because I can’t find the bag. I call my husband while he is in the bathroom and ask him if he’s seen the bag of plushies or if he moved it . He comes out a little while after  and helps me look he begins to realized and connect the dots. The week prior his grandparents  took a trip to Mexico  to visit family since his grandma was retiring and she was ready to celebrate . They always place stuff they want to take with them on the table behind the cage so they won’t forget them when they’re loading up the truck. He goes and asks my mother in law to come to the garage and asks her” did my grandparents take a big bag with stuffed animals that were on top of this cage” she gasps so loud and the pit drops my eyes immediately start to water she goes” was that your wife’s bag of things” he goes yeah , she looks at me but I don’t want her to see me cry so I excuse my self and head over to the bathroom I break down the instant I locked the door and I just start bawling my eyes out sniffling and mucous coming out of my nose the whole deal. My husband later comes into the bathroom and checks in on me and has how I’m doing first thing I yell out why he brings me into a tight hug into his chest and I just keep on crying and wailing out. Why would they take them? Are they OK? Will they be safe? It was labeled. Why would they take something that is labeled they knew it was mine but they still took it and he says I don’t know. I really don’t know what to tell you and I just keep crying and crying out to him sniffling it’s in between silent cries and outbursts at some point he starts patting my head and he says I understand. I understand you and I look up at him I snuffle and tell him you don’t understand because if you did, you would be talking to them about it. You don’t know the type of memories and emotions all of those plushy’s have for me Later then says what if I take you to the store and replace them all  you know buy you new ones I look at him in this disbelief and say no,no why would you want me to replace my plushy‘s and I just break down I buckle in my knees and I just fall and I’m just crying. I’m crying in his legs, he’s still hugging me And we just stay there for a while until I come off at some point I feel like he got tired of my crying, he picked me up, looked me dead in the eye as he’s holding onto my shoulders and says stop it think about this rationally And I’m telling him what I feel like doing that I wanted to bang my head in the wall that I wanted to pull my hair. I wanted to scratch my skin. I just wanted to some other pain than The loss of my stuffed animals he repeats again think about this rationally. What do you want me to do? Do you want me to tell my family to bring back your stuffed animals? Is that what you want me to do I look at him crazy and I’m like yes of course I want you to tell them to bring back my stuffed animals. Why would I not want them back? He says OK but I want you to stay calm stop crying. and so I just shut off my emotions. I went numb. It’s something I do when I want to pretend to be happy for other people and immediately my mask went up. I faked smiled. I looked at him. I nodded agreeing to his statement OK I say he says all right. He stepped out. The bathroom goes. Talk to his family and I head to our room and I’m just laying in bed. I couldn’t cry anymore. He comes back and then tells me to go outside into the backyard where our dog is while his mom is out there on the phone with her sister and then show me on video Call the stuffed animals and I look at  them. I took one look and I said yeah it’s them  just devoid of emotion. I just wanted to get it over with. I didn’t want to keep thinking about it so I excuse myself, I didn’t wanna be there and they said that they were gonna ship them back and that I was lucky  i made it  in time because they were planning on ripping apart my stuffed animals and using the filling the stuffing to make pillows to sell I’m not even sure if all of my plushies were there. I’m not 100% sure if I brought all of my childhood plushy’s from my childhood home into my new home I’m scared to know if they’re damaged or if they’re not all there or if I don’t remember all of them and then my husband, he seemed upset at me and was stand-off ish with me and went straight to playing games with his friend. Later on my mother in law comes in and asks me to speak with her in the bathroom . She apologizes and didn’t realize that she sent my stuffed animals away by accident and that it would hurt me so much. My husbands grandparents asked her why I was crying and she didn’t tell them anything so everyone has assumed me and my husband are having marital problems. She then said not to tell them I’m upset about my stuffed animals because then they would be confused as of to why I reacted the way I did about them and that I would be overreacting for “stuffed animals”  I’m still numb but pretending to be okay in front of everyone I’m just not as playful or talkative with them as I was before so AITAH  for still being upset at my husband and family",1,1748726910.0,u_Only_Asparagus1458,0,1.0,False

We've seen him taken to a hospital once, but he was back out the next day, no better than he was before. 

Sorry if this isn't the right sub to ask about this in, I figured that there's got to be someone here who would can help, or knows a trustworthy organization that can help. I'm just really worried. If things keep going at this rate, I'm scared that he won't make it much longer. Obviously he can't be taken anywhere without his consent, and I don't blame him for not wanting to be taken somewhere.

The weed flavor is so powerful that I can only stand it if I mix it into a strong cup of chocolate iced coffee - but I don’t want to have to get really caffeinated to use it. I take a medication that prevents me from just using the classic OJ method.

Maybe it's just an instinct when someone seems to have so many important things going on and so much drama, it seems kind of unbelievable.

Anyway, I had no proof that he was lying about anything, just a feeling. But we decided to spend the day in a hotel and in the room there was coffee/tea/milk as usual. At one point he decided to look at the milk sachets and proclaimed that as he expected, many of them had expired 2 months prior and went to throw them in the bin. He had to leave early so I had the room to myself and something told me to check the milk sachets he'd thrown away and lo and behold, the ""best before"" dates were all the way in September and October of this year. Not even expiry dates.

This just confirmed what I thought about the guy, that he's a compulsive liar. But I just don't get why. I don't really know what to do as he seems like a nice person otherwise but I've told him before how I feel about lying and now I have evidence that he's a liar.

I’m here, pen in hand, tracing constellations and wondering if you’re out there; someone who sees love not as a fairytale, but as two souls stitching their vulnerabilities into something unbreakable.

I am a mix of old-school romance and modern sensibility, holding onto the ideals of loyalty and sincerity. I think handwritten notes, surprise dates, and the belief that small gestures make a big difference. I am someone who thrives on deep connections and meaningful interactions.

I’m someone who believes in the power of midnight conversations, in the healing balm of shared laughter, and in the silent solidarity of presence.

I believe in the power of empathy and the importance of being there for those who matter, even if it's a call at 3 AM. I value integrity, kindness, and a good/weird sense of humor. I find beauty in the mundane, the kind of person who finds joy in the little things and believes in taking the time to truly understand and appreciate others.

Physical Attributes:

* Height: 5'11"" (181cm)
* Build: Slim
* Hair: Straight Deep black, kept in check
* Eyes: Brown
* Beard: Short, fashionable, and pristinely groomed
* Complexion: Tanned, Caramel toned

**Interests:**

I find solace in music that echoes my moods, books that transport me to other worlds, and quiet moments in nature that ground me. I cherish activities that nurture growth, whether they're intellectual debates, serene walks, or shared laughs over coffee. I'm drawn to the arts as much as to the simple pleasure of a sunset.. I also have a keen interest in cooking and experimenting with new recipes, finding the act of creating something delicious for others as a form of expression and care.

To sum up some typical interests include: Philosophy, nature, languages, books, reading, writing, video games, sports, art, poetry, travelling etc

**What I Am Looking For:**

I'm in search of someone who values open and honest communication as much as I do. Someone who understands that relationships are about growth, learning, and supporting each other through life's myriad challenges and joys. I am looking for someone who is eager to prioritize getting to know each other, willing to open their heart, and ready to build something meaningful together.

Expectations:

* Mutual respect and understanding
* Openness and honesty in communication
* A shared desire to prioritize our relationship and growth
* An interest in exploring life's depths and joys together

**The Quest for You:**

What am I seeking? Not a perfect person, but a real one. Someone whose heart speaks the language of kindness, whose spirit dances to the tune of sincerity. I dream of a connection where words are just the beginning, where vulnerability is not a weakness but our strongest bond. I yearn for a love that’s both a safe harbor and a grand adventure, a partnership built on mutual respect, understanding, and the shared bravery of baring one’s soul.

I seek a fellow traveler in this journey of life, one who understands that while our pasts may shape us, they do not define us. Someone who stands at the intersection of hope and reality, ready to embark on a path not devoid of challenges but rich with the promise of true companionship.

**Epilogue of Hope:**

If my words have stirred something in your heart, if you too are navigating the vast oceans of life in search of a genuine connection, then perhaps we are two stars meant to align in the constellation of fate. I extend my hand, my heart, and my story to you – not in desperation, but with the quiet confidence of one who has faced the night and yearns for the dawn.

On Monday we went to his parents’ house, on Tuesday and Wednesday we went out to eat, on Thursday we ate at my place, and on Friday we went out to eat again, Last night, my best friend (22m; let’s call him Felix) was cooking some king ranch chicken that his mom brought over to his apartment (king ranch chicken is a casserole that’s very popular to make in Texas, which is where his mom is from). He was glad he had the dish to make cause he was otherwise out of food besides Kraft mac & cheese cups.

Well he had a cooking fiasco (as he described it). He heated it for 45 minutes in the oven on 350° like his mom told him to, but it wasn’t even warm yet (it was pre-cooked according to her and she stored it in the freezer there until time to heat it in the oven). He did it for another 30 minutes but it still didn’t get warm. So he heated it in the microwave for a minute and it got to lukewarm. It finally got hot after two minutes in the microwave but since it took nearly 2 hours to do it all, he ate almost the whole thing (it was supposed to last him two nights) since he was so hungry after waiting forever to get the dish warm.

So today we went to the pool at our complex (we’re neighbors btw) and my friend Sarah came over and tanned with us. Later when we went back inside to our apartments, he texted me asking if I wanted to grab dinner later because he was out of food and didn’t want to DoorDash cause of all the fees and shit. I told him I might be doing dinner with Antonio depending on when Antonio got off of work (he works at a local coffee shop that his dad manages) but that I’d let him know.

Felix told me to keep him posted and I said I would. He also told me he asked his parents what they were doing for dinner because he really doesn’t want to eat dinner by himself again and said he didn’t care if he ate with me or his parents, he just wanted to eat with somebody. He does have plenty of other friends but he says sometimes it’s easier for us to plan stuff since we’re neighbors (and I will agree with this; I’m just a flight of stairs away).

There was one time where he asked me if I wanted to do dinner but I told him I was eating with Antonio; I’d seen Antonio all of that week and the previous week and Felix thought he was being put on the back burner and we had an argument about that. I’m wary of this happening again if I choose to go eat with Antonio again this week (we had eaten together all week). Me and Antonio are in a relationship though and when you’re in a relationship you’re naturally gonna see your S/O more often than everybody else. Felix made it sound like he was gonna be upset if I didn’t eat with him.

WIBTA if I don’t eat dinner with Felix tonight and instead eat with Antonio again?

Walking in it kinda felt off na. They did this face scanning thing, and I was pointed out as having really oily skin. The lady who was doing it kept complimenting me asking me how old I was cause i look really young and when my birthday was. I said 25 and told her my birthdate, then she goes ""Oh my gosh, same age lang tayo, and my birthday is actually on the next day!!"" I couldn't tell if she was bluffing cause she had a face mask on. Then there was another lady who kept chirping in on everything she was telling me. It felt like i was part of a skit haha. Then suddenly the other lady goes ""Paano yan ma'am hindi sya pwede dumiretso mag pa picolaser pag hindi pa sya nag pa hydra facial?"" That's when the scammy marketing came to play. She said I had to go through and get a hydra facial cause the pico laser would mean nothing if I did it right away. 

They showed me their clear folder said that they had members who pay about a million pesos annually to get unlimited services and products. And pulled out a calculator and started giving me the rundown of what service i needed for my face. It came up to Php5000 I was screaming inside, then I stopped her and told her I didnt come here for that, I came here for the picolaser only. She kept pushing me, that it came to the point that she said ""yung araw2 mo na pag ice coffee equivalent na sa facial na yan, beauty is an investment"" But i refused. 



 We went through with the picolaser and while I was still on the bed she came into the room and had a bunch of products, and started selling them to me. I was not going to buy those, i got irritated so I let her yap about their moisturizer, and limited edition toner. She had her facemask off and wala sa pag bubully ha pero if you're trying to sell something to me and telling me you swear by it, i better see it on your skin. She looked way olderrrr than 25. Pasayloa ko pero i was so pissed. After her long marketing speech she also gave me a discount, instead of it being 25k it would now be 11k. I just kept nodding my head until she asked, are you going to pay with cash or card maam?  i flatline told her ""I'm not buying that"".   I told her i have my own skincare regime that I stick to and also I dont have the budget for that. Then she goes ""Ah sge maam, ubosing mo muna yung mga products na meron ka if pwede istop mo na kasi ito yung kelangan mo. Promise mo sakin pag maubos mo yun babalik ka bibilhin mo to ha, Promise mo sakin yan maam"" I said ""di ako mag popromise pero I'll think about it.""

Traditional roles.  He's our provider and I'm a SAHM.  He is a very successful, detail oriented person.  I have ADHD.  

He told me a couple weeks ago that he needs me to make a meal plan to follow because of elevated cholesterol.  I told him ok.  

I made an Excel sheet and everything, and am compiling a list of recipes that are healthy and palatable.  

I have tried to stick to the meal plan, and have about 75% of the time over the last 2 weeks.  I've swapped a meal with another (Wednesdays meal on Monday, for example) and there was a night where we got caught up in a new game as a family and ate leftovers.  

I asked my husband yesterday which meal he prefers and it initiated a sit down discussion of how upset he was that I wouldn't follow a simple meal plan like he asked.  

An entire night of fighting ensued over how he asked one simple thing of me and if I valued our marriage then I would follow it to the letter.  He works and provides and I should be thankful.  He says he would do ANYTHING to make me happy, no matter the request, if our roles were reversed, even if it were as silly as touching a mailbox every day.    I told him if the roles were reversed I would never just tell him to do something without discussing it with him, let alone put him on trial if he made a tiny adjustment.  

I'm upset because I thought we were talking about a meal plan to ensure we could adhere to his new dietary needs, and didn't know that simply switching days and not accounting for leftovers in the plan meant that I failed him.  I'm upset because he clearly had alterior motives and set me up to fail.  

Should also mention that the entire night of arguing included frequent comparisons to our roles being little different from the roles required of him at work.  He is expected to simply do something when asked, but because he has proven himself a reliable member of the team, he has the ability to work with the management team to find the best solutions to the tasks.  I apparently, do not, because I can't make a plan and stick to it.  

For what it's worth, I make sure there is a meal for us to eat every night, one way or another.  The house, kids, and pets are cared for without him needing to lift a finger.  I make him coffee and bring it to his bedside every day, including weekends, and make his breakfast M-F, as well.  I often make and bring him his lunch, too.   I'm not perfect at it, and could be better, but we live comfortably, or so I thought.

I have lost a lot of time and blame my episodes primarily on my lifestyle of substance abuse from weed & coffee, bad relationship choices, and past trauma that could have been avoided, like having two abortions. 

I’m 35, not married, and have a Master’s that is only truly useful in the field of choice if I pass my board exam within less than a year & a half. It’s been delayed by half a year due to my most recent hospitalization.

All credit cards had to be closed, lost my condo, & a relationship, though toxic (which I am still addicted to) so it is like I am having a severe detox.

I don’t even know how to go through our pictures yet would be so sad to delete them. But, going through them later in life could possibly spiral me into an episode. The deep emotions of the loss of our child through my choice will always haunt me and I pray it slowly fades into just a sad thought that goes away. It hasn’t even the slightest yet any time I think about it. Especially since I am not even a mom yet and don’t know if I ever will be.

My tremors are a constant reminder. Now they are in my teeth. Very distressing even though mild.

What I do have going for me is a small but steady support system (mom, step dad, aunts, cousins) 

Yet, I miss the toxic ex so bad. There are so many memories attached yet he always had me at arm’s length. 

I’m also not used to having any money because I don’t know if so am fully ready for a full time job but am thinking it’s time to look for a part time one while I study.

Trying to see if I can go on temporary disability and see if it is retroactive but I believe they said it’s not. 

Basically, my point with this message is how do ai hold on to the faith without being completely numb or fearing life all the time? 

How can I look more forward towards life? 

How can I learn to love myself again and be okay if I end up living alone. 

It just seems like there is still a long road ahead to feel so empty and sad despite being on meds for this.",4,1748726147.0,BipolarReddit,2,1.0,False
1l07sok,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l07sok,"CAO Pilón Robusto Review – Old-World Technique, Modern Flavor","The CAO Pilón Robusto is one of those cigars that leans into history without getting stuck in the past. Inspired by the traditional pilón fermentation technique - where tobacco is fermented slowly in circular stacks to develop deeper, richer flavors—this cigar combines craftsmanship with complexity in a way that feels deliberate, satisfying, and just a little rustic.

I lit this one up in the late afternoon with a bold cup of black coffee and a good playlist humming in the background. From first glance to final draw, the Pilón offered a smoke that felt honest, hearty, and well thought out.


Presentation & Cold Draw

Wrapped in a warm, slightly oily Ecuadorian Habano leaf, the Pilón Robusto has a rich, reddish-brown color and a slightly rugged charm. There are some visible veins, but the seams are tight and the roll feels solid and weighty in hand. It’s not flashy - it’s classic in the best way.

On the cold draw, I picked up sweet tobacco, earth, dried fruit, and a touch of cinnamon, with a subtle spice that promised something interesting once lit.


First Third – Rich & Rustic

From the first puff, the Pilón hit with a bold yet balanced mix of earth, cedar, and roasted coffee. There’s an old-school vibe here - nothing gimmicky, just honest, well-aged tobacco doing its thing. A light sweetness - almost like molasses - rolled in gently behind the spice, rounding out the edges.

The retrohale offered a nice kick of white pepper and toasted wood, giving it just the right amount of complexity early on. Burn was slightly wavy, smoke output was generous, and the cigar stayed cool and composed.


Second Third – Deepening Flavor

In the second third, things settled into a deeper, fuller groove. The spice softened just enough to let notes of cocoa, leather, and a touch of dark fruit come forward. That molasses note evolved into something more like browned sugar or raisin, adding a faint richness to the core earthy profile.

The texture of the smoke was creamy, almost chewy, and the draw stayed smooth with minimal resistance. The burn line correct it self with ease, the cigar felt slow, steady, and evolving.

Final Third – Earthy, Bold, and Balanced

As the final third rolled in, the flavor profile became earthier and a bit more robust. Charred oak, espresso, and pepper returned to the spotlight, creating a slightly bolder finish without losing the cigar’s balance. The sweetness faded, replaced by a dry cocoa and black coffee note that lingered nicely between puffs.

The burn line stayed straight all the way, and the ash held strong, reflecting the quality of the fermentation and construction behind this blend.


Final Thoughts

The CAO Pilón Robusto is a medium to full-bodied cigar that tells its story through tradition, texture, and balance. It’s a cigar that rewards patience and pairs beautifully with coffee, bourbon, or even a dark stout. If you're a fan of earthy, richly fermented tobacco with a touch of sweetness and spice, this is a cigar worth your time.

With a smoke time around 60–70 minutes, it’s perfect for when you want to unwind and lean into something classic, satisfying, and a little soulful. Would I smoke it again? No question. The Pilón has earned its spot in the rotation.",2,1748726118.0,cigar,2,1.0,False

1l07rgj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l07rgj,"CAO Pilón Robusto Review – Old-World Technique, Modern Flavor","The CAO Pilón Robusto is one of those cigars that leans into history without getting stuck in the past. Inspired by the traditional pilón fermentation technique - where tobacco is fermented slowly in circular stacks to develop deeper, richer flavors—this cigar combines craftsmanship with complexity in a way that feels deliberate, satisfying, and just a little rustic.

I lit this one up in the late afternoon with a bold cup of black coffee and a good playlist humming in the background. From first glance to final draw, the Pilón offered a smoke that felt honest, hearty, and well thought out.


Presentation & Cold Draw

Wrapped in a warm, slightly oily Ecuadorian Habano leaf, the Pilón Robusto has a rich, reddish-brown color and a slightly rugged charm. There are some visible veins, but the seams are tight and the roll feels solid and weighty in hand. It’s not flashy - it’s classic in the best way.

On the cold draw, I picked up sweet tobacco, earth, dried fruit, and a touch of cinnamon, with a subtle spice that promised something interesting once lit.


First Third – Rich & Rustic

From the first puff, the Pilón hit with a bold yet balanced mix of earth, cedar, and roasted coffee. There’s an old-school vibe here - nothing gimmicky, just honest, well-aged tobacco doing its thing. A light sweetness - almost like molasses - rolled in gently behind the spice, rounding out the edges.

The retrohale offered a nice kick of white pepper and toasted wood, giving it just the right amount of complexity early on. Burn was slightly wavy, smoke output was generous, and the cigar stayed cool and composed.

Duration: ~12 months. Health conditions: ADHD. Medications: 36mg methylphenidate hydrochloride 1× daily. Health history: mitral valve repair, sepsis, infective endocarditis. Allergies: none.

I've been getting awful intermittent headaches for the past year or so, occasionally with clear fluid running out of my nose when leaning forwards. I know a CSF leak is exceedingly rare, but I am somewhat concerned about this given my history.

I worry because around a year ago I accidentally double dosed my medication and drank coffee before going to work, and then a few hours later during a busy period I got a really really terrible headache and fast heart rate, I did end up sitting down in the chiller until it became bearable but I didn't seek medical attention because it was so busy, which makes me think my blood pressure may have spiked quite high.

Since the past month or so this has evolved into an almost constant headache, often this headache gets worse if I move suddenly and is usually accompanied by an aversion to bright lights, I can also feel fluid constantly dripping down the back of throat along with an occasional volume clear thin fluid running from my right nostril when I lean forwards, sometimes I can hear a bubbling noise inside my head too. I should add that I'm not at all feeling unwell or feverish aside from fatigue and headaches.

I did the tissue paper test and the fluid didn't make the tissue crunchy or stiff, but I also know that a CSF leak is incredibly rare so I'm on the fence about whether I should get this checked out or if I'm just being a hypochondriac. it would be really embarrassing if it turns out I was getting worked up over nothing. 

Is a CSF leak at all likely? Or is this just some sort of irritation or migraine and I'm just overreacting?

I went my entire school career with undiagnosed OCD and Anxiety. I also have a slight physical disability in my right arm that didn't make things easy either. Now, that that's out of the way...

Going into college, (I didn't know it at the time) I stupidly majored in Communications and Journalism. I did everything I was supposed to do. I did clubs, extracurriculars etc. I ended up graduating Summa Cum Laude. I even got a job after graduating, in my field too!

Things took a turn when that dream job became a nightmare. I made less there than at the retail job I’d left. I was overworked, handling the duties of an entire media team while my efforts were constantly scrutinized. I stretched myself to the point of insomnia, stress nosebleeds, and burnout, but somehow, I wasn’t a team player because I couldn’t stretch myself out just *that* much further. 

I eventually left for a more relaxed customer service job, which led to a marketing internship. However, I was frequently pulled away from the internship to cover staffing gaps and help a manager that didn’t know mouse shit from coffee grinds. The promise of a full-time position was dangled over my head, so I figured I’d just embrace the suck for a while. When said full-time position finally came up, I was never notified about it. By the time I applied, it was given to someone else. I took that to mean they had someone else in mind from the get-go. If I did something wrong or was just shit at my job, I wish they would’ve just told me. 

I was expected to just crawl back to the department that overworked me like a good little invertebrate. I put in my two weeks’ notice (with nothing else lined up), so both positions ended at the same time.

Since then, I’ve been working low-paying jobs. I ended up taking a job in a mailroom. It was the only job that said yes to me after months of ""No's"" and I needed the money.

 I spent a year doing an accredited Paralegal certification while working. It honestly hasn’t been worth the time or effort. I called various law firms inquiring about positions, even ones for secretaries, and I was turned down. The one that did have an open position, told me they were looking for someone that was bilingual, on top of having the cert. I almost threw my phone against the wall after the call ended.

So now I’m stuck and all the options seem to lead to more dead ends. I wish I could go back to school, but taking on all that debt after graduating virtually debt-free scares me. 
I could quit my crappy mailroom, but I'd just end up back in retail or customer service again.

Hey everyone! I'm dealing with something that's been frustrating me and wondering if others relate.

I keep trying different expense tracking apps but they're all so overwhelming. Mint wants me to connect every account, YNAB has this steep learning curve, and most others throw 20 features at me when I just want to log what I spent on coffee this morning.

The bigger issue is I keep forgetting about my finances or future planning, and then some fine day it hits me that I haven't been tracking anything or thinking ahead. Then I panic and try to get my act together, but get overwhelmed by complex apps again.

I'm honestly at a loss here. I just want something dead simple - like you open it, type 'Starbucks $5' and you're done. But everything seems designed for people who want to manage their entire financial life.

1l07hvd,https://www.reddit.com/r/coworkerstories/comments/1l07hvd/they_tried_to_screw_us_and_got_screwed_instead/,They tried to screw us and got screwed instead,"I used to work in very small office. After the pandemic we were working hybrid and i only had to come to work on site twice a week. I am a Data Engineer, which means that i spend pretty much all day processing sensitive data and my job requires focus. 

At first my team's spot in the office was near the sales team. They basically spend all day making calls and are generally huge extroverts so there were too much noise for us. Unfortunately, the company demanded us to work on site 3 days instead of one so we requested a different spot as one more day surrounded by the sales team would significantly affect our job.

They then put us next to the finance team and HR. Now, me and my coworker were pretty close. We would sometimes talk amenities (more specifically financial market and soccer) but mostly work. And of course, never too loud as the data we processed was often confidential.
Now, to give a little background. The finance team was 3 people. All ""normies"". And boy, they talked all day. And really loud. Abou the shittiest subjects like internet celebrity gossip, politics (and of course their sources were social media), their own lives (mainly the lady accountant love life) and of course, gossip about people from the other branches.

Even though the noise was too much for us, we kept quiet and never complained because there was simply no other spot that would work better for us. Then, we started to get complaints. First it was during 1:1s. But then my boss was calling me and my friend out in our team meetings. Because basically every time we were on site, there were complaints.
We immediately stopped talking about anything non work related and would just talk through Teams or Whatsapp.
Our boss noticed the change and even compliment us. But the next week, there were new complaints. For context: the company is really small so the person above our boss was literally the cfo. And those complaints were not filed in hr, but to her. So it was a huge deal. One day we got called in her office with our boss. As we enter we see the whole finance team leaving. She then tells us that she's disappointed bc its been weeks and nothing changed and that unfortunately she will have to take a disciplinary action. My boss immediately defends us stating that in fact we haven't been talking about anything non work related and that it is absolutely impossible not to. He explains ou change and state that even though we stopped talking about other subjects it's inhumane to expect that we spend 24 hours side by side every week and never talk about anything.

She accepts my boss explanation and give up on any disciplinary action. We decide not to talk AT ALL, only discussing work through Teams and jumping in a conference room when is absolutely inevitable. We spend a whole week not saying anything besides ""good morning"", ""goodbye"", ""let's have lunch"" and ""do you want me to fill you coffee mug/water bottle"".

And Guess what? Another complaint. This time the ceo spend the week paying attention on us and actually saw that we eliminated any conversation.
She then called us and guess what, the finance team in her office. She asked them to explain the complains and says that she personally supervised our little silence pact qnd that there were no reasons  to complain.

Well, one of them proceeds to say that even though we got better this week, it is still pretty noisy and since they run numbers and stuff they need absolute silence. 
At this point I've had enough. I then say that if they need silence, they should be silent too. That we’ve been working in complete silence for a week, and yet they continue to talk loud, constant, and often about extremely frivolous or even inappropriate topics for a professional environment.
They look at me, stunned. One of them demands that we be relocated instead, since we’re clearly the ones causing discomfort. My work bestie, who’s been quiet the entire time, finally speaks up and says, that we’re not the ones who complained. They are. Repeatedly. And falsely. And now that we’ve proven our point, they just wanted us gone because we confronted them with the truth.

Our boss backs us up, reiterating that we’ve done everything possible to be respectful, professional, and focused. The CFO then says firmly that relocating us is not an option, that our current space is the only one with the infrastructure we need for our work.

Then says that the finance team will operate from where the data team used to sit, where there’s laughter, clapping, motivational speeches and someone ringing a literal bell every time they close a deal. 
A few days after they moved I caught one of them saying to the other something like ""how can anyone work in this hell"".

Now they know.

1l07gyu,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1l07gyu/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the cafés. Even the cafés can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a café, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a café wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their café and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local café can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

Over the next month we hung out a decent bit around the house and I started developing a pretty serious crush on her.  Around October we've become pretty good friends and it's turned into the biggest crush of my life. I'm crazy about her, she's pretty much the girl of my dreams.

One big issue, she's been in a relationship this whole time. Anyways, Around October time we have quite a few moments that make me think, 'she might like me back.' but with her being in a relationship I try to put it in the back of my mind. Right around the start of November she disappeared. For months I wondered what I did. Well in March I think, another roommate got too drunk and let it slip that around November she told her that she has a crush on me. So I think she stopped talking to me so she could push her feelings for me down.

Come March time her boyfriend breaks up with her. She's absolutely crushed. We slowly start talking again. I try to be a supportive friend, taking her out to do things to cheer her up, take her mind of things, get a break from her 70 hour work weeks, etc.. Our bond really starts growing again. While drinking we have a few more moments, some decent bit of flirting at times, but while sober she keeps things pretty platonic.

Early may comes and she's still struggling. One night I catch her as she's leaving, and she invites me to come along with her to a work happy hour. We go out for a few hours, I'm a little tipsy and she's decently drunk. We eventually get home and she decides she wants to walk around. We spend the next 30 minutes walking one way and decide to head home since it's about 12:30am at this point and she works at 7am.  On the way home things get very flirty.  
At one point she lays down in the grass pulling me down with her. We lock eyes and she spends a while stroking my arm. At another time she needed a break so we sit down and she rested her head in my hand. Moving on I carry her a few times. Then comes the sad part of being drunk - she starts calling hating on herself, calling herself ugly and such. I break and confess how beautiful I think she is, I tell her she's the cutest women I've ever met, which is true. We continue the walk home, and she randomly stops and then gives me the best hug I've ever had. It's been a few weeks and I still think back to it every 30 minutes.  
We finally get home, and she wants to watch a movie. We sit on the couch and she dives over and starts cuddling me. We spend the next two hours with her in my arms, me playing with her hair until she eventually falls asleep. Her being drunk, I didn't take any of her dozen openings to kiss and do more.

A few days later we go grab a coffee. Just before getting home I talk to her about the night. She says she's fine with everything that happened. I ask her if it meant anything to her and she tells me she's not sure, she's still struggling with the breakup and is confused. She brings up concerns of us dating while roommates, and ask me several questions about what I'd be looking for.

A week later I ask how she's doing with everything and she tells me she needs space but don't take it personally. I stopped texting her and when running into her I kept things to hellos and short small talk. Thursday after running into her a few times and getting in my feels I finally caved and texted her asking how she's doing and asking if she still needs space. I have not gotten a response yet.

Today my landlord let me know that she'll be moving next month. I'm really worried that if we don't work things out I'll never get to see or talk to her again after moving.  
That night made it clear she has feelings for me again, there was a lot of passion, it wasn't just a drunk girl needing comfort. although they're hidden under a lot of sadness, maybe some confusion and a fear of being hurt again.

I just don't really know what to do at this point. Do I try to reach out again at some point? Do I just let it go and see if she ever reaches out. Did she lie about being okay with what happened?",2,1748725155.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

1l07fld,https://www.reddit.com/r/HellionTales/comments/1l07fld/terrifying_supernatural_encounter_that_happened/,Terrifying Supernatural Encounter | That Happened Recently,"**The Cursed House on Maple Street**

My name's Detective Marcus, and I've been a cop in Virginia for fifteen years. I've seen some messed up stuff, but nothing prepared me for what happened on Maple Street in 2019.

It started with a call about a dead girl. Emily, nineteen years old, found hanging in her basement by her older sister Sarah. When I pulled up to that fancy house, man, something felt off immediately. The air was thick, like breathing through molasses, and my skin crawled just looking at the place.

Empty energy drink cans littered the front porch, and there was this Ouija board sitting on the patio table. The wood looked burned around the edges, like someone had held a lighter to it. Already, I'm thinking this ain't gonna be a normal suicide call.

Inside, the family was a wreck. The parents, Mr. and Mrs. Davidson, couldn't stop shaking. Sarah was pale as a ghost, kept mumbling about how Emily had been ""talking to her dead boyfriend"" through that damn board every night for months.

Down in the basement, it got worse. Way worse. The temperature had to be twenty degrees colder than upstairs, and there were more energy cans everywhere - dozens of them, like the girl never slept. Another Ouija board sat on a coffee table, but this one was different. The planchette was moving by itself, just slightly, like someone invisible was nudging it.

Emily was hanging from an exercise band tied to a beam. Her face was blue and swollen, but here's the thing that still haunts me - her eyes were wide open, staring right at that Ouija board. And I swear on my mother's grave, when I looked at that board, the planchette spelled out ""MINE"" before stopping dead.

My partner Jake helped me cut her down. The girl's body was ice cold, but when we laid her on the floor, I noticed scratch marks on her wrists and neck - fresh ones, like she'd been fighting someone off. The coroner later said those marks happened after she died. How's that possible?

Sarah told us Emily believed she was talking to her dead boyfriend Marcus - yeah, same name as me, which creeped me out even more. This dead guy supposedly kept begging Emily to ""join him"" on the other side. Sarah tried to get Emily help, but the girl was obsessed, staying up all night with that board, chugging energy drinks, getting thinner and more hollow-eyed every day.

We wrapped up the scene, filed the report, and I figured that was the end of it. Boy, was I wrong.

Exactly two weeks later, I'm responding to a fatal car crash. A BMW convertible had flipped and rolled, killing both occupants instantly. The woman had a broken neck, her head twisted almost backwards. The man had been thrown from the car - half his skull was missing, brain matter scattered across fifty yards of asphalt.

When I ran their IDs, my blood went cold. Mr. and Mrs. Davidson. Emily's parents.

I had to tell Sarah her entire family was gone. The girl broke down completely, sobbing about how they'd been acting strange since Emily died - hearing voices, seeing shadows, finding the Ouija board moved to different rooms even though she'd thrown it away.

A month later, I got another call. Hit and run, jogger struck down in broad daylight. You already know where this is going. Sarah Davidson, twenty-two years old, died three days later in the ICU.

Here's the kicker - I did some digging on that house. Turns out, back in 1987, a doctor named Harrison lived there. Guy tried to perform surgery on himself, but ended up disemboweling himself in the basement. Same basement where Emily died. The doctor's widow sold the house immediately, said it was ""infected with something evil.""

Every family that's lived there since has had weird stuff happen. The Hendersons moved out after their teenage son started sleepwalking and trying to hang himself. The Kowalskis lasted six months before their daughter began talking to ""invisible friends"" who told her to hurt herself.

I'm no expert on the supernatural, but I think Emily opened something when she messed with that board. Something that fed on death and wanted more. It got her first, then her parents, then her sister. A whole family wiped out in two months.

I transferred to a different precinct after that. Couldn't drive down Maple Street anymore without feeling that same sick heaviness in the air. The house sold again last year to a young couple with a baby.

I tried to warn them, but they thought I was crazy. Three months later, I heard the wife had a nervous breakdown. She kept claiming something was trying to hurt her baby, that she could hear children crying in the walls.

They moved out last week. House is empty again, waiting for the next family. Waiting to feed.

If you ever see a house that feels wrong, that makes your skin crawl just looking at it - trust your gut. Some places are hungry, and they'll take everything you got if you let them.

Hi! I’m Stephanie. I’m 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection. I’d like to find someone I can confide in, get to know on a personal level, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older(30+). Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don’t have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I’d be okay with it if there was some flirting involved, but I’m not looking for anything very sexual. If your post history is mostly or completely nsfw, we likely won’t jive. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I have a dog that I love very much 
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health
*[This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/zghhOJ8)

That’s just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interests you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started! Chats preferred over messages. 

Ice breaker question! What is the best movie or tv show that you’ve watched recently?

I considered these pursuits a cope, or basically just pointless. But as of late a creeping suspicion has arose: that being a physical beast is actually the highest ideal to strive towards, for a man and by proxy myself. 

It feels like being strong, being able to fight, being able to protect the ones you care about trumps being twinkish. Is being big and strong seen as attractive to high class dames or artsy chicks? I read Sun and Steel and it convinced me to care about my body, but Mishima was still rather svelte and I'm talking about going Fedor-mode more or less.

Ive been in a LDR for 6+ years and we're planning on moving together in about two months (he lives in another country so it'll be a huge change for me since I'll be the one going). 

About 2-3 months ago I met a guy through a common friend. We chatted and got along pretty well. Went out once more (with our mutual friend again) since he had told him (my friend) that he had found me interesting. He got my phone number and began texting me occasionally. 

Around 3 weeks ago he invited me to go out just the two of us, to get a coffee and talk. I accepted and told my partner who is super fine with me going out with friends. 

After that day, this guy has been texting me almost daily and, I won't lie to you, I liked it since it is quite interesting to talk to him. Still, to be clear, the conversations have been mostly about music and cinema recommendations, occasional jokes and that's it. I would never let it go further.

Now that I'm so close to leaving home for good, I got a good dose of anxiety and this new guy has become one of the main sources. He hasn't done anything particular to doubt about his intentions, neither have I given him enough trust to try something more on me. Even so, I cannot stop thinking about him. I've just seen him thrice (he has invited me to go out in more occasions but I have declined and I plan on keeping it that way). Lately Ive been trying to take some time to reply to his messages and when I do, I try to be curt in my answers. I avoid his invitations and deliberately leave him on seen. 

Seeing his replies is starting to annoy me and make me nauseous. Why is that? I get this sense of guilt from feeling I'm starting to like him even though it's been such a short period of time. I truly feel as if I was being unfaithful (which I objectively know I am not). I am someone with a very small threshold for guilt so whichever thing I believe I'm doing wrong can trigger a huge  discomfort on me.

I guess I've gotten to be this way about male friendships because 1. I dont have many and 2. My past experiences have been terrible, with most of them wanting something more from me, not keeping distance and not respecting boundaries. 

Ive been feeling so anxious for these past 3 weeks that I've dropped around 7 pounds, I can't concentrate at work and I've been acting strange and distant towards my boyfriend (I feel like I don't deserve his love).

Damn, putting it all into words makes it seem so simple and irrational on my side but I swear to you I can't help these feelings.

I talked to my psychiatrist and he told me I had two options; keep the friendship in a mature way or just start distancing myself without ghosting. Im opting for the second option but the guilt is still there. Ive been endlessly wondering whether or not I am a bad person. I love my boyfriend and I want to have a life with him but this freaking guilt numbs my senses and turns me into a depressed mess. I dont want it to be this way.",3,1748724717.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

—————

**Should I Be Wondering How Well I Really Know My Husband?** 

A typical house in a typical suburban neighborhood at lunchtime. A knock at the door. 

“Excuse me, Ma’am. We’d like to ask you a few questions.”

“Oh. I’m sorry, my husband isn’t home right now. He’ll be back around seven.”

“That’s alright, ma’am we wanted to speak with you specifically.”

“My husband doesn’t like me having people over when he isn’t home…”

“We’re the police, ma’am,” they say, showing badges. “I’m sure your husband would understand.”

“Well… I guess…”

She reluctantly lets them in.

“Would you like some coffee? I have a pot on.”

“No, thank you. You seem a little nervous.”

“I’m sorry, Detective…”

“Johnson. And this is my partner, Detective Williams.”

“I'm sorry, Detective Johnson. I’m just not used to having people over when my husband isn’t home.”

“Yes, you mentioned that before. Has he told you not to have guests over?”

“I just know he doesn’t like it.”

“Are there other things he doesn't like you doing?”

She shifts uncomfortably. “What are you implying?”

“Oh, nothing at all, ma’am. Just standard questions.”

“My husband is a good man. We’re very happy.”

“I’m sure you are. Speaking of your husband, where is he currently?”

“I don’t know, exactly. His work keeps him traveling all around the area. But he’ll be home around seven if you want to come back then.”

“So you don’t know exactly where he is right now?”

“Well, no. Like I said—“

“He travels all over for work. Do you know if he was traveling three nights ago?”

“Yes, he had meetings in the city.”

“When did you see him that day?”

“When he came home for dinner after work.”

“Was there anything unusual about him?”

“No, not that I recall. He came home like always, greeted me, hopped in the shower—“

“Does he always shower when he gets home from work?”

“Yes - he says he doesn’t like bringing the messiness from the day into our home.”

“What about the clothes he was wearing that day? Where would they be?”

“At the dry cleaners - he always drops them off each day. He says clean clothes are the mark of a professional.”

“What about two weeks ago? Was he traveling then, too?”

“Why are you asking all of these questions?”

“No reason, ma’am. Just gathering information.”

“I don’t believe you. What's really going on?”

A pause. The agents look at each other. “Have you heard of the killings in the area over the last few weeks?”

“The ones on the news? What about them?”

“Have you seen anything unusual about your husband lately? Anything that might seem suspicious?”

“No, not that I can think of— Wait - do you think my husband was involved in those killings?”

“As we said, we’re just gathering information.”

“Do I need to be worried?”

“Is there anything about your husband’s behavior that would worry you?”

Silence. 

“Ma’am, if you feel you need protection, we can have someone sent to keep an eye on you.”

“But they can’t be here all the time, can they? And if he found out about them, and then they left…”

Pause. 

“Do you really believe my husband could have been involved?”

“We can’t be completely certain, but we’re taking the possibility very seriously. It’s important that you take steps to ensure your safety.”

“But what do I do when my husband comes home?”

“Just act like you normally do. As far as your husband is concerned, nothing has changed and nothing needs to. Here’s my card - let us know when he ‘leaves town’ or if you notice anything suspicious. We’ll have someone here within minutes if you need us.”

Later that night, there’s a noise in the basement. She goes down carefully to investigate, but sees only what she expects to see. 

>!Her husband, on the floor, chained to the wall.!<

>!“Hello, Martin. Sorry to keep you tied up like this, but it’s your own fault, really. If you hadn’t kept sleeping with all of those sluts, I wouldn’t have had to kill them. But at least you’re good for something - you’ll make a great scapegoat when the police get too close. And to think, they think the problem is that *I* don’t really know *you!*”HAHAHA!!<

Does anyone know how it works, if it can be simply removed? If I was to custom a new loom for my gaggia, would this be a necessary inclusion or can it be negated?

I understand that the circuit takes in the power switch and coffee brew switch. as both reset the 20min counter. Just trying to get an understand of what is is, what it does, and if I start doing custom wiring with PID's or anything. Do I need to care about it.

Did I get the various texts? (There were ALOT) etc. I told her I was getting my coffee. Their response:

""How long does it take to drink a cup of coffee? You DO realize you CAN get it to GO? Why didn't you just bring it and your lunch WITH you?""

Well...I told her:

1. I'm supposed to follow my schedule as written so I'm doing that.

2. I do realize that I can get coffee to go and lunch to go...Buuuutt...I just didn't FEEL like it. I wanted to take my time and enjoy my coffee and lunch.

I go to sit outside while a panicking OM is calling for help and trying to get orders started before they turned themselves even redder.

Fast replies. Fast food. Fast everything. We grew up watching the internet go from loading bars to infinite scroll, and somewhere along the way, rushing became normal. Like if you're not constantly doing something, you're falling behind.

But recently, I’ve been trying to move slower. I’ve started making my coffee without checking emails. I go on walks without my phone. I eat dinner without a screen in front of me. Not to be more productive, not to optimize anything. Just to be there. And it’s done something to me that I didn’t expect. It’s been calming. Almost like telling my body and mind, you’re safe, you don’t have to hustle right now.

Slowness started to feel like a kind of self-respect. A way to push back against the burnout culture we’ve all absorbed for years. It reminded me that I’m not a machine, and I don’t want to live like one.

Mornings are peaceful. Just sipping coffee, watching the light shift in the kitchen, and messing around with this little app I’ve been building to help me stay a bit more present. No rush. No noise. Just a few quiet minutes to feel like myself again.

If you’ve been feeling overwhelmed or scattered, maybe the answer isn’t doing more. Maybe it’s doing less, but being more present with it.

I hope you’re having a cozy, calm, or at least slightly sweet kind of day. I’m reaching out with an open heart, looking for a cuddle buddy and maybe a new friend here in the Netherlands — ideally near Amsterdam, but anywhere not too far works too!

A little about me:

• I'm 35 years old guy working as an executive and happily calling Amsterdam home for over 3 years now.
• I live alone, take care of myself, and try to stay fit — but also never say no to dessert.
• I’d be happy to host or come to you — whatever makes you feel safe and comfortable.
• I love being outside, especially in the summer — picnics, strolls, a lazy lunch on a sunny terrace… simple things, really.
• Traveling is a big part of my life and dreams — I’d love to see the whole world, one new place (and snack) at a time.
• I’m a good listener — friends often say I make them feel calm and heard. You’ll get lots of warm, respectful hugs and cozy company if that’s what you need 🤗
• Cleanliness and kindness go hand in hand for me — I value both deeply.
• I'm 183 cm tall, 80 kg, have broad shoulders, little muscular, tanned skin, black hair, brown eyes.

What I’m looking for:

Someone to share gentle, genuine connection with — whether that’s cuddling up on the couch, sharing a quiet moment over coffee, or just chatting about our days.

I’m also open to making new friends — movie nights, cooking together, mini-adventures nearby… whatever brings joy without pressure.

And of course, if you’d prefer to meet in a public space first, that’s absolutely fine — your comfort always comes first.

So if you’re someone who values kindness, closeness, and maybe the occasional silly laugh — I’d really love to hear from you. 💛

Let’s make a little space in this busy world for warmth and connection.

the owners have been pretty strict on recording our shift drinks and marking wastes. they’re pretty stingy as well. they’re losing money so they’re trying to see what they can do to cut costs, etc. 

they’re also pretty vocal about not giving homeless ppl free things and only letting paying customers use the toilets. this is valid as i understand things can get out of hand. but today a young man came in, waited in line, and politely asked for a cup of coffee (the strongest possible). he said hes homeless and would appreciate anything. the book would say tell him no but i gave him a large drip and he said thank you a dozen times and left. 

ofc he was super respectful but i also understand this can get out of hand. i know i shouldnt do that again but i also feel so bad for him. its so hot today and i get to go home to my cold house with water and shower while hes still in the same area, probably sweating and hungry. 

im still thinking about him and what i can do. is there anything i can do realistically? i wanted to give him a gift card (that i already have paid for) but i thought that would encourage him to come in again after the card is done. is it worthwhile to give him a ‘goodie’ bag of water, dried foods, underwear etc? again he was extremely polite and respectful but im a young woman who works nearly everyday so i dont want to be remembered. im also saving my money for college so i cant do this more than once.

I recently watched a video called “AI can talk now.” It was fairly innocuous — just a few AI-generated actors speaking and emoting like humans. Nothing groundbreaking in the age we’re living in.

Still, it evoked a terror deep within my soul as I grappled with the endless ways this technology could bring about the end of days.

I work (and still work) in the film industry, specifically in the locations department. I see first-hand the countless ways it stimulates the economy in British Columbia.

In locations, we work with municipal film offices to bring crews into some of the most stunning forests, parks, cityscapes, abandoned buildings, farms, private homes and government facilities that Canada has to offer.

The locations department alone usually works with a budget of at least half a million dollars — just one slice of a much larger pie.

I manage these budgets. I know where the money goes, and I can tell you that it largely ends up in the hands of local people and businesses.

For example, if we’re filming at a small retail shop in a neighbourhood, that shop might be paid $10,000 or more to close for the shoot, plus for prep and wrap days.

Neighbouring businesses get smaller payouts for the ­inconvenience. The city earns permit fees, processed by ­dedicated film office staff. Traffic control companies are brought in.

Several rental companies are hired for cones, lifts, tents, chairs — you name it.

On any given shoot day, there might be close to 500 people working on that production, from cast to truck drivers, electricians, PAs and camera crews.

A tab gets opened at a local coffee shop. People living in nearby apartments are compensated for the disruption.

An elementary school down the street hosts our support vehicles and gets paid, too.

I could go on — film moves like a hungry beast, invading neighbourhoods beyond their capacity for a single hectic day and leaving behind a legacy that can boost local tourism for years (looking at you, New Zealand, post-Lord of the Rings).

Some people are annoyed by the chaos, but you can’t deny the economic ripple it creates.

Now imagine AI doing all of that virtually. Realistic environments, actors, lighting — entire scenes recreated digitally, without the crew, the gear, or the permits.

We’re fast approaching a future where a major cinematic experience could be created by a single person with a few hours and a powerful computer. The studio heads will be thrilled. Thousands of jobs around the world? Gone.

British Columbia alone directly employs upwards of 40,000 people in the film industry, not counting the auxiliary businesses that survive on its back.

Okay, but 40,000 people isn’t everyone. It’s not even a large percentage of everyone. So let’s think of another example.

Imagine a classroom with a screen at the front and an AI-based teacher. AI contains the most up-to-date encyclopedia in the world — instantly accessible, infinitely patient and constantly improving.

Can you imagine a better ­educator? Sure, kids would still need a human supervisor in the room, but that person wouldn’t necessarily need a teaching degree. That would change what we pay — and who qualifies to guide a classroom. There are still many jobs that only humans can do. But there are a lot of skilled jobs that AI could either fully replace or make redundant.

Maybe it designs better, more fuel-efficient vehicles. Maybe it shortens health-care wait times by handling low-risk prescriptions. Maybe it eliminates traffic accidents by replacing all drivers with self-coordinating AI vehicles.

Every sci-fi movie scenario, good or bad, now feels like something we might actually see in our lifetimes.

I believe we’re standing at the edge of a cliff — utopia or dystopia.

There’s no real point in resisting AI; it’s happening. We can delay it, we can regulate it, but progress always pushes forward.

We can either harness it to build a better, more equitable world, or we can sit back and watch a wealthy few use it to turn the rest of us into ­meat-robots for the AI ­overlords.

Which brings me to the real point of this ramble: Basic. Universal. Income. It is our single greatest tool to prevent economic collapse in a world where more and more people are made economically redundant.

Now is the time, as Canadians, to get loud. Give people the power to spend. Help us keep the economy alive.

Let people who have lost their livelihoods find purpose again — give them the means to clothe, feed and house themselves.

And for the love of God, tax the hell out of the corporations profiting most from this ­revolution.

Four years ago, I (26m) was dating someone I'll call Sarah (26f) during undergrad. We had this intense, deep connection, and dated from 2019-2021. She was brilliant, ambitious, destined for big things. I loved that about her. But she had a habit of lashing out when she was upset, and I started to follow her lead. Our relationship was intense but explosive, and we fell into bad habits about communication. We fought more than most couples, but figured that was bound to happen with two similar (and similarly intense) people.

We moved to the same city after graduation, but didn't even make it to October. I was young and insecure, and when I started struggling with career decisions a few weeks after graduation while she was thriving, I panicked. I told her I couldn't handle with the asymmetry in our successes, and that I had to take a step back to figure things out. It was cowardly and stupid and I realized my mistake within days, but the damage was done. For her, balancing a high-pressure career in a male-dominated field was difficult enough, and so hearing that from her boyfriend was too much. She couldn't trust me after that, and we ended things.

I've been in a relationship with Emma (26f) for three years now. Emma is wonderful - kind, stable, trusting. I can count our fights--hell, even our arguments--on one hand. We've built a life together, though have been long distance since late 2023, and she has no idea anything is wrong. 

But I never \*really\* got over Sarah. She was always there in the back of my mind, and I eventually made peace with it by telling myself it could never work out and that I had to move on. That I couldn't let this ghost of a relationship prevent me from finding love elsewhere. We'd have occasional contact over the years, nothing inappropriate, just check-ins. Last summer we ran into each other at a mutual friend's party and ended up getting drinks a couple times in the weeks after. Nothing physical happened, but the connection was still there. Undeniable. 

We both went back to grad school in different cities - I'm in law school, she was finishing up her master's program - but started texting regularly throughout this past school year. Daily, or close to it. About our programs, about the stress of applications and job searches, about professors and internships and career frustrations. We've both done extremely well for ourselves professionally and academically, and so there was this real understanding there - we both knew what it was like to be grinding through these intense programs, to be chasing the same kinds of opportunities. It felt like friendship, but also this closeness that went well beyond what it should have for exes.

Over the last few weeks, things started ramping up. I learned through a mutual friend that Sarah had reached out to get coffee with him, where she asked primarily questions about me, including if I was still seeing anyone. She reached out to me to help solve logistical crises and proofread final papers, we wound up spending hours on the phone. She sent me photos from her graduation last week. Nothing inappropriate, but solo photos in her cap and gown that were clearly meant to say ""I look good and I graduated and I want you to know that."" Then photos of her outfits, under the guise of choosing what to wear. The types of things you probably don't send to ""just friends.""

Two nights ago, Sarah was in my city handling some logistics, and we met for what was supposed to be drinks and catching up. Yes, I know. I failed to set boundaries and, obviously, it wound up not being a nice little hour-long chat. We ended up talking until the bars closed down. Really talking - about the breakup first, about what went wrong, about the nature of our relationship altogether, about how we've both grown since then. She told me that back when we were dating, I had been the person she relied on completely during her worst periods, but when I needed that same support, I couldn't accept it from her. She was right.

I told her things I'd never admitted to anyone - that I'd been infatuated with her from the moment I met her, that dating her had felt like winning the lottery, that I'd put her on this pedestal and couldn't bear the thought of her seeing me as anything less than perfect, and that I'd come to realize how destructive that had been. She stopped me mid-sentence, insisting it was important that she say this: that she'd fallen in love with who I was as a person, rather than any paper accomplishments. She said some very kind and gentle things that I won't sully by writing down.

But we talked about so much more than that. About our work, our fears about the future, what we wanted our lives to look like. About the people we had dated since breaking up, about what we'd learned about ourselves, about whether we thought some connections just persist no matter what you do about them. She said I was still the person who understood her best, even after all this time. I, foolishly but honestly, told her the same was true for me.

There's this thing about Sarah where she just gets me in a way that's hard to explain. We think similarly, we can jump between serious intellectual conversations and stupid jokes without missing a beat. Being with her feels like being the most myself I've ever been - like I don't have to perform or pretend or hold back parts of who I am. And she feels the same, remarking at multiple points over the evening that the two of us could always talk for hours and feel that no time has passed at all. That she feels like I'm the only one who gets it.

At one point she said something that stuck with me, about how cruel it has been to feel fate pulling us in opposite directions. Because that's what it felt like - we'd found each other at the wrong time in college, and now we'd found each other again at another wrong time, with her about to move across the country and then overseas for a year.

When the bar closed, I walked her back to her hotel. It felt safe because she was in town with one of her girlfriends (sharing a hotel room), so I knew I couldn't get dragged into anything I'd regret. But we kept talking on the sidewalk under the streetlights. We were both unwilling to let it end.

Eventually, she looked up at me and we just... embraced. Really embraced, for the first time in four years. I could smell her hair, feel her breathing against my chest. It was like every defense I'd built up just collapsed. Her arms were wrapped around me and my hand found the back of her neck.

And then, with her head buried against me, she quietly told me ""I love you.""

I said ""I love you too"" without thinking, because it was true. It's always been true, even when I was trying to convince myself it wasn't.

We held each other for a long time. I kissed her forehead. It felt like home.

Now I'm sitting here two days later and I cannot believe this all happened. Sarah is moving across the country next month for work, then leaving the country for a year starting in August. There's no practical future there, at least not anytime soon. But I can't pretend that conversation didn't happen. I can't pretend I don't love her more than I've ever loved anyone.

And the worst part is that I'm in a fucking relationship. And what was a good one, at that. Emma trusts me completely. She tells me all the time how secure she feels with me, how much she loves our relationship. This will hurt her very much and it will come completely out of nowhere from her perspective. We've been together three years. We have shared friends, shared plans, a shared life. That's not nothing.

But I also can't keep living dishonestly. I can't look Emma in the eyes knowing I'm in love with someone else, and that I told her that. I can't pretend to be present in our relationship when part of me has always belonged to Sarah, and now I know she feels the same way.

I know what I have to do. I know this is the end of my relationship with Emma. But I'm terrified. Sarah and I might never work out - the timing has always been catastrophically wrong for us. I may lose everything stable and good in my life for something that might not even be possible. 

I don't need or want advice. I don't need people to tell me I've emotionally (and probably physically) cheated - I know that. I don't need people to tell me I'm a piece of shit - I know that too, trust me. And I truly do not need or want sympathy, nor would I be asking for it.

Hey there, MaximizeMe fam! 🙌

Ever catch yourself staring blankly at the wall, lost in a sea of unfinished tasks, wondering just *how* people manage to stay focused? Yeah, been there. I’ve tried caffeine binges and sticky notes plastered everywhere, but the foggy brain days still crept up. So, I took a daring leap into the icy world of Wim Hof breathing for a week. Spoiler alert: My cortisol levels have some juicy secrets to spill!

First, let me set the scene. Picture me, sprawled out on my yoga mat, phone timer in one hand, and a nervous sense of excitement bubbling up—I’m about to hyperventilate on purpose! 😅 Wim Hof breathing basically felt like inviting a hurricane into my lungs, but hey, science says it's got merit, right?

**Here’s what went down:**

- **Day 1:** Felt kinda dizzy, not gonna lie. But once I caught my breath, there was this unexpected *zing* of clarity. It’s like spring cleaning for your brain, but without the dust bunnies.
  
- **Day 3:** I was a lot less frazzled at work. Emails didn’t stress me out as much, and my focus? Razor-sharp. Seriously, is this what superheroes feel like? 🦸‍♂️

- **Day 5:** I took a peek at my cortisol levels (thank you, nifty app 🧘‍♀️), and it showed a noticeable dip. My usual morning stress spike? More of a gentle wave now.

- **Day 7:** By now, I was a breathing pro. Did it hack my nervous system? Maybe. Boost my mood and focus? Absolutely.

One thing’s for sure, I was less of a grumpy cat before that second cup of coffee. ☕️ Do you know how rare that is?

**Some takeaways:**

- **The Rush:** Those cold showers the method encourages? Yikes! But hey, no pain, no gain?
  
- **The Zen:** In between bouts of hyperventilating, there were these blissful calm moments. Like tapping into a secret reserve of inner peace.

- **The Curiosity:** Cortisol reduction is just a part of this. Next, I’m diving into more science-backed nervous system hacks—care to join?

So folks, if you’re feeling deflated, maybe try coaxing a little *hurricane* into your life. 🌀 Who knew intentionally turning blue from hyperventilating could turn your focus golden?

What do you think—is it worth disrupting your routine for a shot at greater focus and less stress? 🤔 If you've tried it, how did it go for you? Let's share stories and keep each other motivated. 🌟

Okay, friends, let’s get real for a sec. Ever sit down at your desk, coffee in hand, ready to conquer the world, and then… poof! The to-do list disappears into a haze of random thoughts, TikTok videos, and that *oh-so-tempting* Netflix series? 🙄 We’ve all been there!

So, what’s my secret weapon? **The Pomodoro Technique.** Sounds fancy, right? But it’s actually super simple and wildly effective!

Here’s how it goes: 

1. **Pick a Task**: Seriously, just one! You’d think that’s easy, but sometimes it feels like I’m trying to choose the next great American novel to read. 
   
2. **Set a Timer for 25 Minutes**: Yup, that’s it! Pretend you’re on a game show and the clock is ticking. 
   
3. **Work Like You’re in a Sprint**: When the timer starts, dive in! No distractions allowed. If something pops into your head (like what you’re having for dinner), jot it down and keep going! 

4. **Take a 5-Minute Break**: Stretch, grab some water, or do a silly dance in your room. Just let your brain breathe for a sec. 

5. **Repeat**: After four cycles, treat yourself with a longer break—15 to 30 minutes. Use this time to refill your creative juices. 

Why do I swear by this? Well, it’s not just a productivity hack; it’s a mindset shift! Suddenly those long, daunting tasks become manageable, like taking small bites of a massive pizza instead of trying to shove the whole thing down in one go (which, let’s face it, is just a recipe for disaster). 🍕 

Now, I know what you might be thinking: **“But what if I get into the zone and want to keep going?”** Trust me, I get it! I’ve found that keeping those 25-minute sprints can actually *enhance* my focus. It’s like a little adrenaline rush, knowing I have a deadline (even if it’s just a timer). 

And bonus: You check off more items on your to-do list without feeling completely drained. Who doesn’t want that feeling of accomplishment? 🙌

So, has anyone else tried the Pomodoro Technique? How does it work for you? Or do you have *other* secret weapons up your sleeve for honing that focus? Let’s trade tips and tricks!",1,1748722368.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

I’m actually writing this the night before I post it to keep up my posting schedule as I have no time today to write a whole review. Today we dip our toes into the pool of headliners for Bumbershoot, and also hit the first artist that I’ve heard a track from before starting this series.

The usual disclaimer, I am not a music critic, I’m just writing these for fun, if I say something dumb let me know in the comments, you know the drill by now. Let’s get into it!

## Day Seven - Sylvan Esso’s *Sylvan Esso*

**About the Artist:** Sylvan Esso is a duo consisting of Amelia Meath on vocals and Nick Sanborn on production. The two originally met in Milwaukee, but formed as a band in Durham, North Carolina. Wikipedia lists their genre as electropop as well as “folktronica,” which I didn’t know was a genre until this very moment and might need to learn more.

**About the Album:** The band’s eponymous album is also their debut album. Originally published by Partisan Records, the album was released May 12, 2014. Consisting of 10 tracks and clocking in at 38 minutes, this is the first album in this series that charted, peaking at 39 on the Billboard 200.

**My thoughts:** Opening the album, “Hey Mami” was probably originally conceived as a looping pedal track, and in fact the background noise that opens the track makes you almost think you’re listening to a talented busker on the streets. The harmonies from Meath layer upon themselves deliciously, and when the beat kicks in it makes you immediately want to groove to the sound.

The instrumentation is surprisingly minimalist here and throughout the album - it’s rare that you’ll hear more than three or four instrument stems playing at the same time. It’s sort of a pleasant change of pace from the wall of sound and assault of bass that’s present on most EDM, providing more space for Meath’s vocals. It must be said that in 2025 the vocals certainly sound overly familiar - we’ve heard this understated indie female vocal styling in several projects at this point. I’ll handicap it a bit though, partially because it was just 2014 when this album came out and also because Meath is a master at it.

Returning to the tracks, “Could I Be” is an eminently danceable song, the vocal layers again combining gorgeously. The chorus is infectious, especially as the vocals become more and more vocoded as the track builds. The lyrical flow on “H.S.K.T.” is tasty as sin, and again the focused production keeps the beat tight and complimentary to the vocals as opposed to overpowering.

Coming to their big hit, the song that broke through onto my playlists, “Coffee” is the sort of song that you know is special after just one listen. I am definitely underqualified to dissect what makes this song such a hit, but I do think again the minimalist production does the song a lot of favors. It also probably helps that I’m pretty sure this was in one or two commercials, but hey, that’s indie for you.

I like the heavier synth on the chorus of “Uncatena,” which complements the slower tempo of the track. It’s entirely possible that this was some of the inspiration for LCD Soundsystem’s track “oh baby,” a song I love. The synth is not as deftly deployed on the following track, “Play It Right,” the first time all album I felt the production overwhelmed the vocals in a negative way. The closing track, “Come Down,” is practically acapella, giving us a chance to appreciate Meath’s self-harmonies unadulterated. The light instrumentation that there is gives the track a dreamy quality.

**Bottom Line:** Tightly produced and deeply danceable, *Sylvan Esso* is a triumph of a debut. With a couple of lesser tracks mixed in (not mentioned, “Wolf” is ultimately a bit forgettable, and “Play It Right” just sounds out of place on this track list), it’s not quite front-to-back brilliance, but the high points are delightful. One of the few albums I want to immediately play again once I finish it. Day Two seems pretty packed, but I’m circling them in the hopes I can see as much of their set as possible. I bet it’ll be pretty packed, though.
