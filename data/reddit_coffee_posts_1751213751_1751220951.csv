1lnlgoe,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1lnlgoe/stomach_pain_headaches_brain_fog_but_tests_are/,"Stomach pain, headaches, brain fog but tests are coming back with nothing","I’m a 29m 150lbs generally healthy eater and active person whose been going through some stomach and head issues for almost a year now, with it being constant for the last 6 months. 

It started with what at first I thought was an ulcer from poor diet and alcohol use about a year ago. It started as sharp pain in my stomach that would last around 2 hours and have me curled up in bed the whole time. Around lunch time almost on the dot every day. However a round of omeprazole seemed to recover me from this.

 Fast forward to New Years this year and after a night of greasy food and New Years celebrations a similar pain comes on. I end up going to the ER as I thought I was having a heart attack or something it was so painful. I had chest tightness and trouble breathing, sharp stomach pain, and my face, hands, and arms all locked up in a twisted position with my muscles hard as a rock. By the time my partner got me to the hospital I couldn’t even talk my jaw was locked shut. They did an ekg and chest XRay and put me on oxygen for a few hours until my muscles untensed. And basically told me to get some electrolytes. 

Since then I have had this discomforting bloating and indigestion feeling all day everyday. Exacerbated about an hour to 2 hours after any meal. This is accompanied with an intense pressure headache that once started usually persists throughout the whole day. Along with the headache and indigestion I get this mental fog that is hard to shake or keep focused on things. I have had an endoscopy and ultrasound showing nothing. And an allergy test showing a slight wheat allergy which I have cut out of my diet for months now. 

I eat a very healthy diet and go on runs 5
Days a week and have great blood pressure. I have not drank alcohol except for mabye 3 times this year to test triggers, same with coffee. I have found that fatty foods, sugar and especially coffee will trigger the stomach pains and headaches especially bad. As well I had 2 alcoholic seltzers the other night and had this very intense episode in my sleep where I woke up cold, sweating, confused where I was with this sense of dread and a massive headache. I’m frightened it was aura before or after a seizure but have never felt like that before in my life. 

Nothing seems to be improving what’s going on and my doctor is still at a loss for what it could be. Healthcare is scarce at best in the part of the state I live in and my doctor just left town for the next 6 months.
Hoping to get on a Telehealth call and hopefully get more tests done but really just appreciate any kind of input from any of y’all on what possibly could be going on or what I can do with my health or what tests to take. ",1,1751220840.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False
1lnlf55,https://www.reddit.com/r/Greenfield/comments/1lnlf55/a_show_of_solidarity_roughly_200_gather_at/,A show of solidarity: roughly 200 gather at immigrant rights rally in Greenfield,"https://archive.is/dHdPn

State legislators, town officials and residents gathered outside City Hall Saturday afternoon to show solidarity with immigrant communities, calling out the impact of federal immigration policies and urging continued support amid the rising threat of deportations.


At its peak, roughly 200 people gathered outside City Hall and on the Greenfield Common for the immigrant rights rally organized by Franklin County Continuing the Political Revolution (FCCPR). Signs and banners varied in messaging, with some condemning U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) or the presidential administration as a whole, while others spoke to the value of diversity, the need for peace and the power of democracy.


Some of the main rally speakers included Sen. Jo Comerford, D-Northampton, and Rep. Natalie Blais, D-Deerfield, both of whom spoke to what they are doing in their positions of power at the state level, as well as what their concerns are with current federal immigration policies.


“You should imagine that the Legislature sees ourselves as a line of defense for our people,” Comerford said, mentioning work done at the state level to support immigrants, regardless of citizen status. “You should imagine that we care deeply about feeding our neighbors, regardless of documentation; about housing our neighbors, regardless of documentation.”


Blais emphasized that coming together is better than being divided and decried the federal government’s actions.


“I am so grateful for the organizers who brought us here today to talk about the fact that what is happening at the federal level is not OK,” she said. “Division only happens when we sew it, lines are only drawn when we draw them, and we are not doing that here in western Massachusetts.”


One arm of Franklin County Continuing the Political Revolution, the Immigrants Rights Task Force, provided information on how to report ICE activity through the LUCE Immigrant Justice Network of Massachusetts, what rights people have as citizens and non-citizens, and what causes attendees can donate to as a way to support immigrants.


Task force member Judith Roberts said the group of now 500 members was established over the winter after President Donald Trump took office due to his administration’s plans for mass deportations of migrants, among other border and immigration enforcement plans. She emphasized their non-violent and cause-no-harm framework, and said the task force’s presence is to be in solidarity with Pioneer Valley immigrants who are fearful of protesting or participating in daily activities in public.


“We are in support of the immigrant community and we take direction from them. Obviously, they’re not here today because they can’t stand up. It’s not safe for them to stand out in public,” Roberts said, a point that was reiterated by musician Annie Hassett, who said during her speech that there weren’t many communities of color present at the rally due to fear of ICE.


To support those who don’t feel safe in the face of ICE activity, Roberts said organizers of the rally wanted to show resistance to the “unlawful, illegal seizure of people who are doing no wrong.”


As reported by Reuters, the White House wants ICE to achieve higher daily arrest quotas of 3,000 migrants per day, up from the earlier target of 1,000 per day. Federal statistics show 47% of those currently detained by ICE have no criminal record and fewer than 30% have been convicted of crimes, despite the administration’s effort to target criminal migrants. Detainment numbers indicate there are 59,000 people in immigration detention facilities across the United States, and those detention facilities were, as of June 23, operating at more than 140% capacity, according to CBS News.


The day before Saturday’s rally, the Department of Homeland Security announced that it would terminate temporary protected status for Haiti, which would put up to 500,000 Haitians at risk of deportation once the designation expires later this summer, according to POLITO.


“Massachusetts’ Haitian community is vibrant, resilient and valued. They are our neighbors, business owners, teachers, early educators and health care providers,” Gov. Maura Healey said in a statement Saturday. “Fifteen years ago, they fled a devastating earthquake, and more recently flood, famine and violence in Haiti — which is still ongoing — and came here in search of a better, safer life. The United States government gave them permission to be here in a protected status years ago, but now President Trump is taking that away. ... This is devastating for them and for our workforce and economy. My heart goes out to Massachusetts’ Haitian community. We are going to do all that we can to support you.”


Despite the odds facing immigrant communities and the ICE activity in the Pioneer Valley, Roberts said she hoped Saturday’s rally was a chance to make “horror into hope” for immigrants by seeing the support around them publicly.


“We’ve heard from the immigrant community that it makes them feel hopeful to see people standing up and to see the signs when you drive down the street,” she said. “And of course, it raises our spirits as well.”

Just next door to the immigrant rights rally at 3 p.m., the League of Women Voters of Franklin County held its annual legislative coffee at Hawks & Reed Performing Arts Center with Comerford, Blais and Rep. Susannah Whipps, I-Athol, who answered questions from league members and the public.


Subjects included the fiscal year 2026 budget, rural education, public transportation, immigrant rights and local action that can be taken to combat the Trump administration. Many of the topics discussed echoed those from the ongoing rally just outside the door.
“Like what had just happened outside, it’s empowering to us,” Blais said to the group of roughly 20 attendees.


Regarding what can be done to show resistance to the federal government, Whipps told constituents that continuing to meet for rallies and conversations at a local level is important. She also emphasized the need to get younger generations involved in the rallies and grassroots effort.


“We can continue to meet out here,” she said, adding that the local movement is growing among her constituents in Orange, with 600 people attending the recent “No Kings” protest there on June 14. “Six hundred people in Orange is a huge turnout.”


Marie Gauthier, president of the League of Women Voters of Franklin County, noted the original legislative coffee was supposed to be held on April 5, but the national “Hands Off” protests led the group to cancel so its members could join in the protests.


This time, the rally outside ended up being a “nice dovetail” for the program, Gauthier said, with similar topics discussed by the legislators and people from the rally coming inside to listen.


“It humanizes the process,” Gauthier said when asked about the impact of allowing constituents the opportunity to speak directly to their legislators. “It shows them how comfortable their lawmakers are and how they truly are working for us.”",1,1751220737.0,Greenfield,0,1.0,False

She was like ‘oh I bet you’re glad to have coffee again’ and I was confused because I’d been having 8 coffees a day whilst on the ward.
6:30am, after breakfast, with every snack, after lunch, after dinner, at night snack and then at 10:30pm before bed. But apparently most wards don’t allow coffee??.

In addition to that, they allowed us to have black coffee with sweetner (blatant ED behaviour - but I’d asked during a meeting and they just said sure 😭)

Then 2 weeks before I got discharged they abolished rest period for those over a certain bmi (obviously loos are still locked) but rest period was gone. 

It’s like one day we got told off for playing catch sat down , the next day we were dancing to the cha cha slide and they couldn’t say anything.

And during rest period (when we had it)we could be anywhere garden, social area, our rooms (no rules about where we had to be).

We were alos allowed as many drinks as we wanted with a meal - had like 6 glasses of water with one meal and they didn’t say anything.

Idk whether that’s good or bad

1lnl7f2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Brewstew/comments/1lnl7f2/alright_so_i_built_a_backyard_water_park_and/,"Alright, So I Built a Backyard Water Park and Launched Myself Into a Grill (Fake Brewstew Story I Hope He Makes. Let me know If I should do more)","Alright, so it’s the summer of 2000-something, and I randomly decide I’m gonna turn my backyard into a full-blown water park. Not a kiddie pool, not a Slip ‘N Slide. Nah, I’m talking about high-speed aquatic danger built by three unsupervised idiots with a death wish.

So I hit up Michael and David, who were both always down for some dumb shit. Michael shows up with a garden hose and no common sense. David brings this old tarp that smelled like mildew and probably had five diseases living in it. Me? I brought pure confidence and zero planning.

We lay the tarp down the hill in my backyard, hook up the hose, and crank that thing like we’re trying to flood the neighborhood. The water pressure was set to skin removal. Should’ve stopped there, but no. Michael goes,

> “Yo, let’s build a ramp.”
And like a certified moron, I’m like,
“HELL yes, we’re building a ramp.”



So we grab a bent-ass ironing board, two cinder blocks from behind the shed, and a random bungee cord David found in his garage. This thing looked like it was designed by drunk raccoons. It was so unstable you could sneeze near it and it’d collapse.

Naturally, I say I’ll go first, because why not destroy my spine before lunch?

I take off from the top of the hill like I’m being launched from a damn cannon. Hit the ramp going light speed, go airborne, and for two glorious seconds, I was free. I was flying. I was about to meet Jesus.

And then I slammed into the kiddie pool like a sack of wet cement. It exploded on impact. Water went everywhere. I tumbled out of the tarp looking like a soaked lasagna, hit the grass, and crashed directly into my dad’s grill.

Grill flipped. A hot dog shot into the neighbor’s yard. Tongs went airborne. I just laid there blinking like,

> “Did I survive?”



Michael’s dying laughing, yelling “BROOOO,” and David’s standing there like,

> “Okay that was sick, now let’s add a second ramp.”



That’s when my dad walks outside holding a cup of coffee, takes one look at the scene, tarp shredded, water everywhere, me half-buried in the grill, and just mutters,

> “What in the hell are y’all doing?”
Then he turns around and goes right back inside like this is normal behavior.



Later the neighbor comes over asking why his mailbox is full of muddy socks and why there’s a shovel hanging from his tree. I told him we were doing “hydraulics testing.” He told us to stay the hell off his property forever.

I chipped a tooth. Michael somehow got a splinter in his knee. David tried to ride the tarp standing up and almost broke his collarbone.

Grass still hasn’t grown back where the pool exploded.

Anyway, 10/10 summer.
Would 100 percent do it again.
Might bring knee pads. Might not.

I tried getting a lift from a friend and offering the few I asked a coffee but non were available, so I resigned to having to get an uber, which I checked in the morning and would have cost 12£. When it came to me having to set off however, the ubers were 20£ which I didn't have, and I was starting to panic about whether I could get into work. (I was home alone and couldn't reach a parent to ask for a bank transfer). Luckily my neighbour came to the door and offered to help retrieve car b from Tesco -since hed helped us start it the day before to get it to Tesco in the first place. I told him we would probably be calling the AA for it and told him not too worry, but when he said he was going to the shops anyway I had to ask (sheepishly) if I could blag a lift. He said sure and I told him he could get some breakfast stuff with my 20% discount which is the best I'm allowed to offer, and I also made him a coffee on the house as a thank you. he was very nice about it and apart from me being a little embarrassed all was well.

just realised this is getting a little long, baso got home, my dad was pissed and said I shouldn't have done it, aitah?

Added context: neighbours moved in a couple of months ago, don't know them that well but have had them over for dinner, they're lovely people and we had a good chat in the car on the way.",1,1751220190.0,AmItheAsshole,5,1.0,False

1lnl5eg,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1lnl5eg/smaller_lelit_bianca_alternative_2000/,Smaller Lelit Bianca alternative? [€2000],"Hello,

I have been through a few sub 800$ machines so far. At last, I settled for a La Pavoni manual lever now for a while.

Still, over time there accumulated a lot of stuff I got annoyed about. Besides, I would love to get just my personal end game machine and just keep fixing it for the next 20 years or so. This idea was mostly what drove me to la Pavoni, but upgrades and replacement parts aside there is just too much fundamentally bothering me about it.

Form this standpoint, I am seriously considering the Lelit Bianca. Mara X was also in the mix, but I figured I might be tempted to upgrade in 1-2 years to get flow control back; so maybe I‘d rather go directly for the Bianca.

Only issue remains is that it is basically over the top. I love milk drinks along espresso, but I usually just get to drink 1 cup in the morning and 1 cup in the afternoon. With a decaf around I might get 3 shots occasionally throughout the day. I am the only one enjoying coffee in my household. It feels kind of wasteful getting such a powerhouse of a machine and underutilizing it like this. I get that with an e61 style there always is just a lot of mass to heat up and going up into more premium segment sizes will just increase.

Still, I was wondering if anyone is aware of a premium machine that offers comparable features and is just smaller / meant for less frequent use.

Location: Central Europe
Preferred drink: cappuccino, cortado
Drink frequency: 1 person; 2-3 / day
Space: Lelit or smaller preferred; but since I am currently building a dedicated coffee table from scratch anything will do
Manual or electric: electric
Candidates: Lelit Mara X, Lelit Bianca, QuickMill Emilia, ?
Other: 58mm is a must as I like experimenting with accessories and other sizes often can be painful when searching for niche stuff

Thanks and best regards

1lnl2ce,https://www.reddit.com/r/oxford/comments/1lnl2ce/oxford_cafe_recommendations/,Oxford Cafe Recommendations :),"Hi all, I have been living in Oxford for 2.5 years and have curated my personal favourites of the cafes I like in the City, along with my grading system. This list is purely based on my own preference and experiences <3 I hope this helps anyone who is looking for good cafe spots in Oxford! 

Near the city centre:

1. The Independent Cafe 

> Coffee: 3.5/5 
> Vibe: The perfect combination of people working and people going there just to chat 
> Go for: Lavender latte and blueberry matcha

2. Maya's @ Westgate Coffee

> Coffee: 4/5
> Vibe: Okay workspace, lovely baristas 
> Go for: Orange espresso and their hot chocolates

3. Theo's @ Broad Street

> Coffee: 3.2/5
> Vibe: Plenty of workspace with plug points, spacious basement floor for working
> Go for: Chai latte 

4. Coffeesmith (next to Covered Market)

> Coffee: 4/5
> Vibe: Slightly dim for work (unless you score a seat near the windows!), lovely baristas 
> Go for: Mocha

5. Society Cafe

> Coffee: 3.8/5
> Vibe: Spacious and comfortable space with plenty of people working, but you have to try your luck to get a comfy seat! Most of the seating is quite small in my opinion
> Go for: Any coffee

6. Black Sheep Coffee

> Coffee: 4.8/5 (the coffee isn't particularly tasty, the high rating is solely because it always helps me go to the bathroom) 
> Vibe: 80% workspace
> Go for: Their current lemonade and matcha series are great, and personally, any of their coffee...when you are slightly...constipated 

Around Jericho:

1. Broche

> Coffee: 3.3/5
> Vibe: Limited seating with tiny tables. Perfect for chatting/dating. 
> Go for: Nothing stands out in particular, but I genuinely love the whole ""little corner cafe for your potential meet cute"" aesthetic. 

2. Opera

> Coffee: 4/5
> Vibe: Okay workspace, but be prepared to smell like grilled wraps. Lovely baristas. 
> Go for: Lavender latte and dirty chai 

Around Cowley:

1. The Larder

> Coffee: 4.5/5
> Vibe: Slightly dim but big tables conducive for working (though there's a sign prioritising non-laptop users between 12-2pm) 
> Go for: Honeycomb latte

2. NEPA

> Coffee: 4.5/5
> Vibe: Limited seating with tiny tables. Perfect for chatting/dating. Amazing customer service. 
> Go for: Homemade banana bread

3. Green Routes

> Coffee: 4/5
> Vibe: Too squeezy for working! Perfect for chatting/dating. 
> Go for: Their amazing food

Bonus:

1. Lyall and Co. (amazing coffee and chai, but they are quite far from the Oxford city centre)

> Coffee: 4.6/5 
> Vibe: Perfect combination of people working (large enough tables) and people chatting. Expect lots of dogs. 
> Go for: Any coffee

I have tried many others that didn't make it to this list, but feel free to let me know if you have any other recommendations! ",7,1751219897.0,oxford,0,0.89,False

Cats rule the internet. That’s just a fact. From laser pointer chases to majestic naps on keyboards, they’ve clawed their way into our hearts—and now, surprisingly, into the world of Bitcoin. Yes, you heard that right. The next time you see a fluffy feline knocking things off a shelf, remember: they might just be trying to fund their next crypto investment.

Welcome to the *purr-suit* of modern money—where adorable cats meet Bitcoin ATMs, and QR codes are the new catnip. 🐈💰

Let’s be honest: traditional banking can be as grumpy as a Monday morning cat. Long lines, annoying paperwork, and those weird pens on chains? No, thanks. Bitcoin ATMs, on the other hand, are the cool alley cats of finance—fast, slick, and totally independent. You walk up, scan your QR code, make your move, and just like that—you’re in the crypto game. No bank tellers, no nonsense.

But wait—what about the QR code part? That's where our app steps in like a friendly neighborhood tabby. [**Bitcoin QR Code Maker**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com) is your go-to app for creating clean, scannable Bitcoin QR codes that even a sleepy kitten could navigate. Whether you're accepting Bitcoin for coffee, cat sweaters, or custom art, our app makes it easy to create payment buttons, donation links, and more. It's like a magic wand for crypto transactions—just without the fur.

Imagine this: a cozy cat café, complete with lounging fluffballs and lattes topped with foam art whiskers. Instead of clunky cash or credit cards, customers simply scan a cute QR code on the counter to pay in Bitcoin. Fast, fun, and futuristic—just how cats would want it. (We assume. They’re mysterious like that.)

And did we mention the QR codes from our app look great? You can customize them to match your brand or your cat’s mood. Minimalist? Check. Colorful chaos? Double check. There’s even an option to embed your logo so every scan screams *you*. Or *meow*, depending on your vibe.

Now, picture this: your cat sits on your laptop (because of course), and you glance over at the screen. You're generating a Bitcoin payment QR code for your online store while Mr. Whiskers purrs in approval. You print it out, tape it to your vending machine or post it on your Instagram, and voilà—Bitcoin payments are live and ready.

So whether you're running a high-tech crypto café, selling cat-themed merch online, or just want to be ahead of the curve, there’s a place for you in this cat-obsessed, blockchain-powered world. With Bitcoin ATMs becoming more common and QR code payments rising faster than a cat chasing a laser dot, the future is looking fluffy and decentralized.

Ready to join the litter-ati of crypto cool? Head over to [**https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com) and create your own Bitcoin QR code today. 🐾💸

I was finishing up a theological degree (a degree I kind of recognized I was peer pressured into), and was just getting more and more burnt out by Church and religion in general due to years of shit and people acting like jerks/treating me poorly that I had been amusing a friend who for me through some of the darkest days of my program by going to Church with him.

I love this guy, and we still are friends/talk everyday, but the thing is the Church I used to be his driver to take him to doesn't even check in with me. Yes, I am not a member of their sect of Christianity, but at the same time they acted like they cared about me but whenever I tried to do shit with them it was always a matter of ""hey how is your friend"" or ""what's he up to?""

It got to be so frustrating that I have talked to him about it and time and time again we've been let down. Frankly, the biggest letdown is that some months ago my appendix nearly ruptured and I didn't get much follow up from anyone there about ""how are you doing?"" It just was so depressing, and I am reminded time and time again I genuinely never felt welcome there. Yeah they tried to make me convert, but the thing is the lack of being a Church to me, or checking on me is why I don't go there.

My friend and I talk a lot about this, and he has used (with my permission) this example of my being ignored in presentations to the larger Church body at one of their schools, but the least they could do is email me. Ask me to get a cup of coffee, or just see me as someone who lives two blocks away and desperately needs connections because he has no one, and who cares if he isn't Orthodox and is someone who is a lapsed/struggling to call himself Catholic.",2,1751219515.0,ReligiousTrauma,0,1.0,False

Against better judgement, I've been working on a passion project of mine, a social coffee and recipe sharing site for antisocial home drinkers. I know, I know. It’s been done a literal million times. I just felt like nothing out there worked quite the way I imagined.

My goals for this project were

- Recording a coffee you’re tasting should be fast. Less than a minute. Great on your phone. As fast as possible.
- Everything should be flexible. Attach recipes to a cupping, or just add one by itself. You can remix other recipes. You can flag the ones you want to remember.
- I want to add super nerdy insights. What have your favorite flavors been over the past year? What coffees would best match that profile? What brewing methods?
- It should be free from any commercial interests, with no invasive tracking or ""path to monetization"" junk.

But it’s very much in beta. Things might break. The design is *not* there yet. If you’d care to give any feedback, I’m open to anything at this point. Have I struck a good balance between speed of entry and detail of information? Are there steps that slow you down? Am I missing obvious coffee tasting needs? Does it work for making espresso?

They were $12.99 and $13.99 when I started tracking them. I bought them for $4.99 and $1.99.

(Is this ripping off authors? In my opinion, no more so than waiting for a book to come out in paperback.)

I don't always track books. When I bought the Curzan book, Amazon recommended *Dryer's English*. The price had been as low as $1.99, but I bought it for $4.99 without waiting for a lower price. (It had been $7.99 for a long time. It's now $9.99.)

I've bought -- (search email, be astonished at the result) -- over thirteen hundred ebooks from Amazon since 2012. Some of them were professional books my then-employer paid for. I've bought non-Amazon books from other publishers, but not nearly so many.

Originally the site was funded via the Amazon affiliate program. Then Amazon canceled its account. It now accepts donations via Patreon (how I contribute) and Paypal.

That's for books from the past century. For everything else, there's Standard Ebooks.

There are many places to get electronic versions of public domain books. You can buy some of them for a dollar at Amazon. Many, many more are at Project Gutenberg. In my experience, the best source is Standard Ebooks.

Standard Ebooks has ""beautiful, free, and unrestricted editions of literature for the digital age."" They describe themselves as ""a volunteer-driven effort to produce a collection of high quality, carefully formatted, accessible, open source, and free public domain ebooks that meet or exceed the quality of commercially produced ebooks."" They look much better than other editions I've read. (Example: ""The Adventure of the Dancing Men,"" from *The Return of Sherlock Holmes*, has messages in the form of rows of stick figures. They're clear and crisp in the Standard Ebooks version, blurry in Project Gutenberg, and shown simply as ""\[Graphic\]"" in an Amazon book.)

What's in the public domain? I was surprised at how much. *The Great Gatsby*, *This Side of Paradise*, and *The Beautiful and the Damned* by F. Scott Fitzgerald, as well as a collection of short fiction. Ernest Hemingway is represented by his own collection of short fiction, plus *A Farewell to Arms* and *The Sun Also Rises*. Early works by Agatha Christie, Edgar Rice Burroughs, and E. E. ""Doc"" Smith. And of course all the classics from the 19th century or before.

A major omission, and it's a deliberate one, is the absence of any religious texts from modern world religions. You'll find many books about religion, but not the Hebrew Bible, the Christian Bible (any version), or the Koran.

Standard Ebooks supports Kindles, iPads, Nooks, Kobo devices and software, and anything that can process HTML or plain text files. Recommended.

My friend Evelyn C. Leeper, who published the above in the MT Void online fanzine, replied: ""\[A\]ll the classics from the 19th century or before"" may be over-stating it a bit. Certainly most of what most people want will be here. And I grant that some of Project Gutenberg's works have various errors from scanning or otherwise. (If I recall correctly, Amazon was even worse, but that was years ago.) But (to take one example) Standard Ebooks has no works by William Gladstone, while Project Gutenberg has eleven, including his three volumes of *Studies on Homer and the Homeric Age*.  Standard Ebooks is probably a good first stop, but if what you're looking for is not there, try Project Gutenberg.",1,1751218908.0,kindle,0,1.0,False

I've been diagnosed as type 1 diabetic and I want to get pregnant next year, so my beige carby diet isn't working anymore. I need to start eating like an actual adult but I have no idea how to prioritise what to work on and how to get to the point where it's a food I actually eat. I can work through the gagging phase until I can manage a bite or two, but can't get past there.

In terms of what I eat:
- Meat: I'm generally fine. I don't love plain chicken or lamb bit I can manage to eat them.
- Dairy: pretty comfortable. I love cheese. I should eat yogurt more but I can get it down. 
- Other protein: I'm fine with peanut butter. I can have a couple of bites of scrambled eggs or maybe a tablespoon of baked beans. I'm okay with cod. I can manage a bite of salmon.
- Carbs: I'm fine with white potatoes, pasta and bread. I can manage a bit of white rice. I've got a hell of a sweet tooth.
- Fruit: I can eat apples and grapes, but I'm scared to because of the type 1. I can manage a bite of clementine or strawberry.
- Vegetables: I'm okay with root veg. Love sweet potatoes, cooked carrots, parsnips. I can manage beetroot, celeriac, peas, turnip. I can have a bite of spinach, rocket, or red pepper.
- I don't drink tea, or coffee, or alcohol. It'd be nice to be able to drink tea or coffee.
- for my blood sugars, I can't really do juices or smoothies or milkshakes. Snacks are meant to be less than 10 grams of carbs per serving but I'm kind of managing with 15g at the moment.

Sorry for the ramble! I'm grateful for any help. The dietician just tells me about the perfect diet of snacking on sugar free jelly and popcorn then having a plate full of veg. I tried to explain I just don't eat a wide enough variety to manage that, and I'm in awful habits from the years of undiagnosed type 1 I had running up to October.

1lnkgfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/1lnkgfe/my_5_month_experience_with_sgi_and_how_i_found/,My 5 month Experience With SGI (and how I found this group),"I'd like to start out by saying that I'm glad I found this group.  I come from a very liberal/open/Christian family (grew up in the Presbyterian Church).   My mother went to seminary for awhile and always taught us to be open, loving, and accepting.   I started a new job at a university and was looking for some sort of meditation/buddhist practice to cope with anxiety and the pandemic.  My  religious/spiritual beliefs are fundamentally set and I believe that all religions have something to offer if they guide you toward acceptance and love.   I got into a conversation with one of the faculty members at my school and she told me about her buddhist practice.  I was intrigued and decided to try it.  (I'm also a former journalist, so I love going into new situations). I went to a few zoom meetings and found everyone friendly and diverse and then went to a larger chanting session downtown in the city I live in. (I also knew about Tina Turner doing it - hey she's cool!)  I was initially very impressed and even said "" It's like Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream realized!""  because everyone seemed so happy and loving and every color of the rainbow was there.   Boy did that rainbow fade - and here's why:

\- Something in my gut turned when I saw Ikeda on that big screen in front of a bunch of men - it smacked of of authoritarianism

\- The heart texts, love-bombing were kind of welcome at first - let's face it - a lot of people are just shits these days - BUT, they became too much

\- An older woman in the group wanted my phone number during the Zoom meetings - said she liked me, gave me compliments...  I genuinely liked her too and we spoke on the phone a few times and had some genuine, nice conversations - but then she kept texting me.  Not always about SGI - but about other things too.   She is in a marriage with a man with old values from the old country that she is from and started telling me about ""marrying the wrong man"".   He doesn't let her drive or go anywhere without his permission and I ended up having to pick her up and take her to meetings. (personally I think SGI is her only escape).  I didn't mind, but here I am single - car on the edge of breaking down and I'm picking her up from her large home in a wealthy suburb! 

\- I went to a couple of larger gatherings and started to chant (although I found it tedious and demanding after awhile) But I did see it as a form of prayer.  After a few meetings, the woman from my work who introduced me to SGI said excitedly in an email ""I would like you to receive your gohonzon! My sponsor will be in town and I want you to meet him!  I really DID NOT know what this all meant.  But I was flattered.  I told her ""I don't think I deserve it yet.""  It just all felt too quick.  She insisted saying that I had been to enough meetings and the leaders agreed.  

\- When I went up onstage to receive it - someone at the mic said something like ""These are your sponsors""... and then something else about being in SGI and then she patted me on the back and whispered behind me - ""For the rest of your life.""    That's when the hairs on the back of my neck completely stood up and I wanted to run!  

\- After that they both came over to my apartment with a gift and showed me where to put the gohonzon (um they moved my most precious photos of my horses and me as a child).  It felt like a violation and I should have said something.  I ended up moving it later to my bedroom at which time they said ""Other people won't be able to chant in there with you"" and I'm thinking ""I don't want people to chant here!""  For many reasons!  Yikes - I live in a tiny one bedroom apartment. 

The interesting thing about all of this is that I do genuinely like these two women that I met!  I kept going but then something else broke me.  My father was ill (he was 88 and eventually passed) and the members were supportive - telling me to chant for the ""best possible outcome"".  I appreciated their perspective.  Then there was a ""test"" about SGI coming up.  My sponsor asked if I wanted to study with her and take it.  I said ""sure!""  but then found myself in the thick of dealing with my father and work demands.  When I told her I couldn't take it at that time she scolded me a bit via email and then said it was ""important for my practice"" and that she was chanting for me to take it.  WTF?!?!  

I spelled out in that  email that I was  I was angry and wanted to back away from SGI.  She insisted that being in SGI was of your ""own volition""  ( I will mention that they both had been very kind about my father and did ask me about him/related stories of their struggles with parents etc).

She and I finally met a couple of months later and she brought me another book on SGI.  I had already found this REddit- bc something in my gut knew something was wrong with this.  There was something strange about her too - she was mimicking my behaviors, buying the same items at coffee, asking me about the religion I grew up in...   I told her why I didn't agree with SGI and asked about all of the money they have - especially Ikeda.  She got nervous and a bit defensive. 

So since then, I have attempted to be friends with the both of them.  I'm strong enough in my beliefs to know I won't be going back to SGI.  But I have to say, I am observing them very closely because I don't want to be friends with people who just want to keep pushing me into a certain direction.  My sponsor/co-worker met me for lunch - I gave her her beads back and she was accepting.  I thanked her and told her I appreciated the introduction but it was not for me and she was completely kind about it.  (I'm not sure if this is genuine or if she knows I could say something to our employer if I felt harassed).  

I continued to receive texts from the older woman near me - we were trying to meet up.  But some texts were also about SGI (like there was someone from SGI who received an Oscar and they went up onstage and said Nam yo Ho...She texted me that - thinking I'd be impressed and I told her ""Please do not talk about SGI anymore.  I'm not coming back.  Please respect my wishes.""  She texted prayer hands said she understood and that she was sorry. 

I just met her for lunch a couple of days ago ( yes I picked her up).  She is seriously the sweetest, cutest woman ever!  But I watched her closely.  When we sat down she pulled out an article from the Living Buddhism mag. on an interview with Lawrence Carter Sr.  the dean of the Martin Luther King Jr. International Chapel!  Yes - it was all about his Baptist AND SGI practice.  Hmmm?   Yeah - wonder why?  Could it have been my announcement that I saw MLK Jr's dream at SGI?  I really got into it with her about WHY I didn't believe in SGI.  Where does the money go?  Why isn't there more charity and action over chanting?  I then proceeded to tell her that I understand that they may want to teach people to rise from within - but where does that leave people who can't chant? (The disabled, the mentally ill - who NEED charity).  

I'm realizing I'm going on and on here.  I really don't know what I think completely about SGI - except that I'm not going back.  I just can't believe there is evil intent on their part.  

\- What drives them to keep trying to snag me?  I mean it's got to be exhausting!  Do they receive some benefit (other than ""good karma"" from doing this?). 

\- Do they actually talk about - ""Hey, make sure you put lots of hearts and love in your texts and messages"". Is this part of their practice?  

\- Do members move up in the organization if they get more people to join? 

\- Does SGI contribute any money to causes at all?  

I'm going to try to continue to be friends with these women, but if they mention it anymore I will ask them to stop one more time.  If it continues I will discontinue the friendship.  I just DO NOT understand the obsession with getting me back.

GF wanted to explore poly / and date and or have sex with man as she’s bi.
I identified as fully gay but was interested in experiencing sex with men so started dating as well. And turns out, I might be bi or atleast like having sex with men as well haha!

First 2 guys I dated (for a longer period of time) were great. Really nice guys, good communication, nice sexual experiences. I only had 2 coffee dates which didn’t work out but we communicate clearly and respectful towards eachother about it and ended it after a drink.

Last week i had a date and although it wasn’t the best date ever i was intrigued as we had really deep talks about kinks and such,  and we decided on a second date, which was today.

When I arrived at his, it turned out he lost his voice completely so we couldn’t really chat.
So after a bit of me telling how my days were and trying to get some out of him we started making out.
Safe to say i did expect something to happen today so although it was verrrry fast it was alright.
Started of fun but rather quickly it turns out he’s on a solo experience.. he asks me a lot of things to do to please him but I feel a bit left out. I did try to point it out but the message didn’t really came around.

After two rounds he falls asleep and nothing is said anymore. After a while I’m thinking what am I doing here? Being confused about what happened, whether I had a completely different expectation of the day, whether he lied to me about this not being a bootycall but a date, and I’m also very disappointed in myself. 
I told him condoms were a must and halfway through he got it off and continued. I did mention it halfway through but didn’t say anything, as i didn’t want to ruin the already not so smoothly going experience.

He eventually wakes up and I try asking if everything’s okay. He says he’s not feeling the vibe and he’s sorry for it. I tell him it’s okay and that it can happen and if he needs something.
He errors and blanks, so i tell him I’m going home as this is not what i expected of the date (or bootycall). I try one more time to ask what just happens as frankly i don’t know what just happened really and would like to know/understand and tak about it, but he’s quite vague.
About not feeling it, about not knowing whether he actually wants this (fwb) or a romantic relationship (which is a possibility with me, but we haven’t really talked that through), about things going too quickly (which I understand can overcome you, but he 1000% initiated the sex.) 

So I leave and the goodbye was really fucking awkward.
I texted him when i got home saying it really felt like a bootycall to me which I don’t like, but if it weren’t I really hope he figures out what he wants and that any choice he makes is valid and okay. 
I asked him about STD’s and he replied he never had one and usually always uses a condom (except for now apparently???)

So long story short: I feel used, I’m mad and disappointed in myself for not sticking up for my boundaries and expectations and I’m also a bit shocked by the solo-sex experience I just witnessed. (Never have had something like this with a woman).
I def don’t want to point only towards him for wrong doing, although I feel he could have done things differently in terms of communication. Now he just left me guessing.

Even if it was a bad experience for him, and I didn’t live up to his expectations, that’s fine but JUST TELL ME.
Hey I don’t like this, could you try it like that or can we stop for a bit as it going too quickly.
Is that too much to ask?

1lnke9a,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedavidpakmanshow/comments/1lnke9a/re_friday_feedback_socialism/,Re: Friday Feedback; socialism,"To David,

I would like to discuss your segment responding to a Redditor who asked why you aren’t a socialist. You laid out a clear and thoughtful answer — that while you support some “socialist policies,” like single-payer healthcare or public education, you’re more concerned with outcomes than ideology. You emphasized pragmatism, evidence-based policy, and not letting labels get in the way of good ideas. I deeply respect that.

But I’d like to offer a counterpoint — not to change your mind overnight, but to extend a friendly invitation: David, you *should* be a socialist. And here’s why.

1. You Already Believe in Socialist Principles — Just Not the Word

When you support publicly funded healthcare, education, worker protections, and strong unions, you’re not just supporting isolated policies — you’re supporting a worldview. These policies aren’t random. They emerge from the basic socialist conviction that human needs should come before private profit, and that ordinary people should have real, democratic control over the institutions that shape their lives.

You often say you don’t care about labels — you care about results. But every policy reflects who has power, and who doesn't. Capitalism delivers results for the wealthy because it was built to. Socialism is about changing the rules so that working people have real power — not just at the ballot box, but in their workplaces, neighborhoods, and everyday lives. That vision isn’t fringe. It’s gaining ground every day.

2. Democratic Socialism Isn’t Authoritarian — It’s Deep Democracy

You’ve said:

“I don’t oppose socialism because I think equality is bad… I oppose socialism because to impose it on all industries is authoritarian if it’s done by the government.”

That’s a fair concern — especially in a political culture that equates “socialism” with gulags and five-year plans. But that’s not the socialism democratic socialists advocate for. We're not talking about a one-size-fits-all government takeover of the entire economy. We’re talking about democratizing the economy, not bureaucratizing it.

Authoritarianism is when decisions are made without the input or consent of the people. What we support is the opposite: giving people real control over their workplaces, communities, and public goods.

Think about it: Most people don’t vote for their boss. They don’t have a say in how their labor is used or how corporate profits are spent. They certainly don’t get to influence the billionaires who shape the economy and the planet. That’s not freedom — that’s private tyranny.

Capitalism already imposes power on us every day. The difference is, we’re told it’s “natural,” so we don’t get to question it.

Socialism isn’t about the state controlling everything. It’s about:

* Public ownership where it makes sense (utilities, transit, health care)
* Worker ownership and strong unions
* Decommodified public services like housing and education
* Democratically accountable institutions that serve the public good

That’s not authoritarianism. That’s democracy — applied where it matters most.

No serious socialist wants the government to run your corner coffee shop or local book publisher. But energy, health, housing, education — these are essentials, not commodities. And if we want a just society, they can’t be left to market chaos or corporate monopolies.

3. Pragmatism Isn’t Neutral — It Has a Class Bias

You often emphasize that you’re driven by outcomes, not ideology — that what matters is what works. But what we define as “realistic” is often shaped by the interests of those who already hold power.

What’s deemed pragmatic in American politics usually means acceptable to capital. Medicare for All is “too radical,” but corporate bailouts are “responsible policy.” Free college is “unrealistic,” but tax breaks for billionaires are business as usual.

Democratic socialism doesn’t reject pragmatism — it reclaims it. It says that dignity, equality, and democracy are realistic, if we organize and fight for them.

4. Capitalism Isn’t Failing Because of Bad Management — It’s Working as Designed

You regularly highlight the symptoms of capitalism: obscene inequality, collapsing healthcare, stagnant wages, broken democracy, environmental disaster. But these aren’t bugs — they’re features.

Capitalism concentrates wealth. It commodifies basic human needs. It prioritizes profit over life. And it places our future in the hands of a few unelected oligarchs.

You don’t fix that with better policy tweaks. You fix it by building a different system — one rooted in democratic control, solidarity, and shared prosperity. That’s socialism.

5. This Moment Needs More Than Reforms — It Needs a Movement

The crises we face — climate change, creeping fascism, alienation, burnout — cannot be solved by market incentives or modest reforms. We need mass movements that challenge capital and build collective power.

That’s what democratic socialists are doing. Organizing tenants. Electing socialists. Unionizing workplaces. Fighting for a world where no one is disposable — and where democracy means more than a vote every two years.

David, you already believe in justice, equity, and democracy. You already know that profit should never come before people. And you already support policies that emerge from the socialist tradition.

1lnkdw9,https://www.reddit.com/r/managers/comments/1lnkdw9/advice_needed_navigating_my_relationship_with_a/,Advice needed - Navigating my relationship with a disengaged manager,"Hi everyone,  
I’m looking for some advice on how to best manage the relationship with my own manager, in a context I find a bit tricky.

I work in a small team (less than 10 people), in Europe. I’m relatively new in the organization, and it’s my first experience managing someone – which, I’m happy to say, is going really well. My direct report is efficient, kind, and the collaboration is smooth and rewarding.

The challenge is my own manager. He’s been in the organization for several decades, at this position, and is now a few years away from retirement. 

To put it plainly: he’s checked out. He’s openly vocal on a daily manner about being tired of it all, complains to any poor soul who's had the misfortune of asking how he's doing for hours on end, and frequently mentions how he just wants to be done with work, in a *very* grumpy tone. While that could be just words, and ""only"" imposing a heavy atmosphere during coffee breaks, unfortunately it also translates into a complete lack of engagement.

A few examples : He avoids giving direction or decisions, responding vaguely or dismissively when asked. He arrives and leaves as he pleases, regardless of official hours. He makes inappropriate comments during informal team moments (even yelling / insulting people when irritated), almost every day. He interrupts team meetings or reportings, derails discussions, and makes the space very self-centered.

I try to stay on good terms with him (he tends to behave better with people he likes, and I seem to be one of them for now), especially as my contract is temporary and I hope it might become permanent. I enjoy the mission, the team and the conditions offered – it’s a good place to be, aside from… him.

Some additional context: he’s the link between our team and another team that’s hierarchically above us. That upper structure works on a mandate system. A new person (N+2) has been elected recently, and the poor lad is slowly becoming aware of the situation. The situation is delicate, as it is a highly political organization, let's just say.

So here are my questions: How can I set gentle, yet firm, boundaries when he drops into my office to chat for ages about anything but work? This happens daily.

How should I handle the constant delegation of tasks he just doesn’t want to deal with (e.g., sending basic emails to clients, contacting people he’s supposed to coordinate with, etc.)?

Is it reasonable to set boundaries when he crosses lines during coffee breaks or informal moments – especially when comments are rude, inappropriate or offensive? I feel like staying silent equals complicity. And what about formal moments, like team meetings?

In team meetings, when he hijacks conversations or reportings, how can I keep things on track respectfully, without creating tension?

I’m walking a fine line: I want to remain professional, and keep a good dynamic for the sake of my current position and possible future. But I also do *not* want to let these constant boundary-crossings affect my work, or mental space.

Any thoughts, strategies, or similar experiences would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance!",1,1751218221.0,managers,1,1.0,False

Yohan, 34, is a single star Neurobiology Hunter, is currently trying to make it stronger by focusing on training Emission to make it so he can use his ability from a distance, and also improve his En to make the sleep ability a passive protective ability.

His dream is to understand the many facets of the Subconscious and Conscious mind in different people of different environments/ genetics. 

That's why he's quite fascinated with the people of Meteor City for their unique way of existing in the world, and currently resides there, working partly as a researcher, partly as a Dementia Specialist. 

He has a loving wife who he met there, and has 2 sons and a daughter. And a cat that says Moo, not like in a cow way, but a cat accented moo. 

He's originally from Begrosse Union.

**Hatsu** 

Name: Touch You No Sweet Dreams

Nen Type: Enhancer

Description:

The user has a left hand ability and a right hand ability that affects the brain.

Left Hand: By having contact using left hand, it enhances the enemy's Melatonin production, which is the brain chemical that makes us more sleepy over time, the enemy is forced to fall asleep.

Right Hand: By having contact using the right hand, enhances the enemies Andenosine Receptor A2A (According to Google Search lol), which is the receptor that keeps you awake and alert, Caffeine affects its effectiveness in real life but here it's with nen contact, makes the target's Brain much more alert in combat, but mentally exhausted over time

Both Hands: By touching the enemy with both hands, the Enemy is put in a state where they are immediately in that state of feeling where you haven't slept for several days and running on coffee for alertness, exhausted by being forced to stay awake despite being so sleepy.

In that range of experience between different degrees of alertness and sleepiness, there is a window of Hypnotic Suggestibility and even a lot of other emotional states, but what duration of left-right mix is different for different types of people. Craziness, World Slowing Down, Coma

Ironically, because his hypnotic ability is Enhancement based rather than Manipulation based, he has to be extra careful when trying to induce hypnosis on a target if they're ordinary people than if they're nen users, because he'd more likely kill the victim than just control their brain.

The feeling of being awake for weeks or months if touched for long term. Ordinary Humans, near instant death, for a Nen User, they may have the ability to prevent cardiac arrest and have some degree of resistance to the ability.

He can also use the ability on himself without touching himself, either to enhance combat awareness or immediately fall asleep.

His weakness would most likely be Nen users whose Hatsu is also a contact type but is more lethal or cunning than his. But he's an Enhancer, so even without his Hatsu, he can still do pretty good damage.

Many weeks later sonic was able to MOSTLY keep ""tails"" in check, though ofc sometimes sonic would look away and see tails chewing an innocent person and one day he left to get a new phone and at the worst time, a certain echidna had to visit... 
Knuckles pov: I have been worried about sonic for the past week he hasn't picked up his phone... ""damnit i'ma go visit him"" I use the master emerald teleport to his workshop as I walked in I saw a yellow 2 tailed fox who tense up, I hold my hands up as in a way to show that I'm not here to try to hurt him ""hey kid... have you seen a blue hedgehog...?"" I asked as I start to remember the call From 2 weeks ago about sonic (hypothetical)question ""oh... so your the kid that sonic kidnapped?"" I instinctively dodged to the right as a knife worlpassed where I was standing, I get in my normal fighting position as the kid starts to attack me rapidly as I was surprised that the kid had a lot of speed, 
Tails pov:   I was staring at a red echidna that walked in he asked about sonic.. I dislike him already... ""oh wait your the kid sonic kidnapped..?"" I hiss as I thrown my knife at him as the echidna dodges... I WANTED him DIED for him to think that I was kidnapped.. I start rushing at him but he block perfect though I couldn't care as I eventually just kicked him right in the testicles as the echidna drops the floor ""AGHH... YOU BITCH-"" I start snapping his bones as I enjoyed myself... 
knuckles pov: I was getting tired but I kept fighting knowing this kid is a fucking lunatic but I wasn't expecting the kid to hit me right the testicles.. I felt so weak.. but I didn't give up yet, but he snapped my legs.. my arms..   all I could do was not scream, so the kid couldn't get any satisfaction.... I just hope sonic could be here soon... 
no one's pov.... later that day sonic walks into the workshop and stops seeing tails with knuckles severed arm in his mouth ""tails..."" ""sonic...."", ""tails where's the body...?"" Tails points to the back room as sonic walks in to see knuckles bloody, broken bones in a corner and with a severed arm, sonic sighs as he drags knuckles into the main room as sonic sees tails tensing up again ""tails don't hurt him anymore.. he's a friend of mine..."" tails stops almost immediately as he sighs and spits out the arm he was chewing... 
meanwhile in a lab/base a certain moustache man was watching everything though cameras ""OHOHO that hedgehog has a new friend? That attacks others? He could be useful for my world domination plans... issue is he looks very unstable.. whatever my future plans shall continue anyways... not like it matters.."" later in life Eggman would regret not killing the fox sooner, but at the moment Eggman gets up from the camera room and walks over to his newest creation... ""metal sonic... you shall be the key to my world domination.."" Eggman hits a button as the chamber said two days left before he can finally use his greatest creation... Eggman laughs with pure madness his hatred for that hedgehog growing more and more...  eggman hears his signals go crazy as he walks over and stares at some stones... ""time stones eh? Sounds very powerful... if I can get my hands on those I defeat that hedgehog easily.. though it's on little planet... i'm over 3000 miles away from there.. whatever.. BADNIKS Start making a base at Little planet pronto"" the badniks leave as Eggman sighs while grabbing coffee And plots every way to murder sonic... 
back with the main characters lol sonic pov: ""and that how I meet knuckles"" I said proudly until I look at my right and see tails fucking asleep while drooling and to my left knuckles is watching some Minecraft fucking video and snoring, I bang my head against the wall as I sob to myself and sleep on the cold the couch... the next morning I got up and heard about Eggman's plan after he tried to sneak attack me again.. as I walk to my tracker and input everything ""little planet huh..? Welp I gota save the day"" I run off forgetting about tails...  
Tails pov: I wake up as I slightly remembered about sonic yapping about something knuckles.. I look around and see no one... no 
Knuckles or sonic as I stare at a computer monitor... ""little planet.. time stones..."" I saw that the tornado was still here.. I grabbed the keys and fly towards little planet to find and help sonic.. and maybe murder... 
no one pov: thus this takes us to the events of sonic CD ALSO 
Bonus: earlier that morning sonic helps knuckles and drop him off at angel Island as knuckles heals himself with the master emerald and now has ptsd from tails and dislikes him, tails is canonically unlicense but still using a fucking plane-, sonic is slowly losing his emotions and more depressed, Eggman is slowly losing his mind just wanting to end that hedgehog.. anyways I shall see you all when I have time for this stuff also i suck at narrating fights also my exe is just there it won't replace anything I just have to work on 2 projects now....

Dearest J,
Again I don’t know what brought me to write this letter to you. However my instincts says—so here I am.

I know that there are times when we are filled with fear and doubts, especially when something good happened. It feels like there’s something in return to feel that happiness. The truth is when something good comes along because simply after the struggles and hardships, you deserve to feel the joy that comes in life.

I know that life is full of uncertainties, J but always remember that enjoy the present. The more we think about the possibilities of the future the more we forget to enjoy what we have now in the present that most likely our younger self wished before. 

Losing people is also one of my biggest fear and you’re one of those people I am afraid to lose. In the short time we got to know each other—you become a huge part of my life. Its weird you had become a part of my routine somehow.

I hope you remember that a lot of people care and love you, just the way you are. I know it’s hard when people leave but keep in mind that at least you know who are worthy of your time and effort.

Writing letters to you is simply one of my favorite things to do we together. It’s like a secret language we both only know. Your server as a safe space to me. Somehow even if you aren’t there— I know that I can still feel you. For me it’s like a secret rule that if one is in the server someone should join.

I am afraid that I may feel demanding at times. I hope I am not. It’s not my intention in the first place. I only wish you the best always. I hope you keep in mind that you’re not responsible to whatever I am feeling because of my bpd symptoms. Me being able to let you know I feel is enough for me. it’s already a huge step for me. I would rather want that you focus on yourself and emotions.

It’s not selfish to choose yourself, j. It’s not bad to rest, feel emotions and letting yourself go from the past. I hope that you’re able to practice that often. 

I wanted to thank you for many things from our friendship, companionship, and how you unintentionally take care of me. Your letter and the tape you had given means alot than you think. It’s honestly the most special gift I’ve received. Nothing could ever outweigh the value of words.

I also wanted you know that no matter how hard thing gets, when I want to let something out, and even if it’s out dated I will always write letters to you because it feels right.

Thank you for opening up that means a lot knowing how hard for you to do that. Just know that all I see is a brave J everytime he shares a part of himself. Tattoo this on your brain that whenever you need someone to listen to, I will be here.

Meeting you feels surreal. Who would’ve thought your even more fun in real life. I hope that there are more adventures to come. Everytime I recall what happened in pampanga, I can’t help but smile.


June 30,

I am sorry for words exchange yesterday. I fear might be too harsh. I just want to protect myself and stood my ground. Reality is I should’ve handled it better especially how I feel towards you. 

I hope that despite what happened I hope we can still be friends and be still close. You matter so much to me than you think. 

Please always be safe and take care of yourself. 

Hindi ko kaya na ganito tayo. Nakakapanibago. 

If you stumbled this letter by chance. I hope you’re feeling better and maybe let’s have a chance to talk.

I will be going soon again in Pampanga maybe let’s grab coffee like we always talked about?

I’m trying to identify this coffee table.

It was in my grandparents house for as long as I can remember, so from the early 80s, but I’m sure it was there longer as they built their home in 1952. Additionally one of my clearest memories is that it had a copy of the newspaper from when JFK was assasinated in the drawer.

On the inside, there are two brass pins where a maker plate would have been affixed.

The bottom of the drawer when removed is stamped:

5675

692 58

Insp. 7 (the 7 is in a box)

And there is a large B stamped to the right.

All of that is included in the pictures.

When searching the drawer pull with Google lens, I was able to find one match for a Heritage Furniture Fruitwood Side Table on 1stdibs.

https://www.1stdibs.com/furniture/tables/end-tables/heritage-furniture-mid-century-fruitwood-end-side-table/id-f_26408922/

The tabletop is what I would call slate, and is independent from the frame itself.

I love this table, have since I was a kid, and I’m so glad it’s in my house, but I would love to find out more information about it if anyone recognizes it.  I believe Heritage is a Henredon brand, but that’s about all I have to go on.

Hey everyone!

I know this might sound a bit out of the blue, but I’m honestly at a point where I’ve exhausted every “normal” way of meeting new people — so here I am, turning to Reddit. I’m hoping to find some cool girls around the Vöcklabruck, Frankenmarkt, Straßwalchen area who are looking for genuine friendship and would like to hang out sometime.

I’m not looking for anything romantic — just pure, platonic friendships with other women. Whether it’s coffee dates, weekend strolls, thrifting, chatting about life, going to markets, museum trips, or just chilling somewhere with good vibes — I’m open! I really miss the kind of easy-going, fun, and supportive friendships that make everyday life a bit brighter.

A little about me:
	•	I’m in my 20s (let me know if you want exact age)
	•	Pretty chill
	•	Into cozy vibes, aesthetic cafés, spontaneous plans, deep convos, music, books, and nature
	•	Not into drama or cliques — just looking for down-to-earth girls to vibe with
	•	I’m not a party animal but I do enjoy occasional outings and fun lowkey adventures!

It’s been harder than I thought to find likeminded people in this area, especially girl friends who are also just looking for connection without it turning weird or complicated. If this resonates with you even a little — please don’t hesitate to message or comment. Even if you’re a bit further out but still in the broader region, I’d still love to connect!

You change your **sunlight exposure, sleep rhythm, eating window, and even your social patterns** ... all of which regulate your internal clock.

That’s why many NRIs experience:  
✅ Poor sleep despite no stress  
✅ Low morning energy  
✅ Cravings at odd times  
✅ Difficulty with weight management

Here’s why:  
Your **circadian rhythm!** the internal “clock” that runs on light, food, and routine, is confused. And when it’s off, so are your hormones.

**3 Easy Fixes for a Broken Body Clock:**

1. **Anchor Your Morning** ☀️ Wake up and step outside for 10 mins... no phone, no sunglasses. Let your body feel the natural light. It resets your hormones better than coffee.
2. **Same Meal Window Every Day** 🍽️ Try to eat your meals within the same 10-12 hour window daily. Irregular eating = confused insulin, ghrelin, and cortisol.
3. **Evening “Sunset Mode” 🌙** Reduce bright lights and screen exposure after 8pm. Use warm-toned lighting at home. It tells your body it’s time to wind down.

🧠 *Your health isn’t just about what you eat, it’s about* ***when*** *you eat, sleep, and move.* Living abroad throws this off, but now you know how to reset it.

1lnk1a7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParisTravelGuide/comments/1lnk1a7/itinerary_review_8_nights/,Itinerary review - 8 nights,"Bonjour! I will be visiting Paris for the first time in August - I am SO excited! I would love your feedback on my itinerary! 

A little about my interests: I'm a graphic designer/artist, studied art history, and took French for 4 years. Also, I love live music. I'm hoping to bring art supplies and use my sketchbook throughout my trip!

Also, I've traveled in extreme heat and humidity before (southern US) - my strategy is to go out early in the morning and late in the evening, and take naps/AC breaks at the hottest and most crowded part of the day. Plus, I give myself permission to skip plans if I'm not feeling well. I don't want to be unrealistic about the jet lag or my energy levels. I will say, my gym's AC is out right now and I'm going to my class in 95F/35C heat so I'm getting some good practice for the trip - lol

1lnk0fs,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lnk0fs,Fui no São Paulo Coffee Festival 2025,"Esse é meu segundo ano indo no festival. Antes de começar o relato gostaria de parabenizar principalmente o estande da Origami, Cafellow e também da Alta Mogiana Specialty Coffee que foram os estande que fui e acabei comprando coisas e o pessoal que me atendeu foi super gente boa. 

Alguns pontos que acho importante falar, pra quem nunca foi: 

- Tem muitas palestras e também experiências como torrar seu próprio café na hora, porém nos dois últimos anos que tenho frequentado não consegui ir porque as filas acabam ficando muito grandes e também porque tem muita coisa para ver

- O festival tem estandes também de leites vegetais, com os três que mais vejo no mercado tanto esse ano quanto ano passado (A tal da Castanha, Naveia, Nude)

- É possível encontrar marcas de Matchá, o que acho bem legal porque as vezes depois de tomar tantos cafés é bom dar uma quebrada e tomar uma coisa diferente

- Tem marcas de chocolate e queijos, além de lojas com acessórios de café e cerâmicas 

- É um evento pra quem trabalha com café, mas também para pessoas pessoas como eu que sou entusiasta, é muito bom principalmente para conhecer lançamentos e novas marcas, tem as grandes e também pequenos produtores.

Pontos negativos específicos desse ano, a primeira se aplica também para o ano passado que eu fui:

- Muitas ativações pedindo para seguir o Instagram, porém no local não fornece Wi-Fi e também o sinal é muito ruim fazendo com que as pessoas até demorassem na fila porque tinha que mostrar que estava seguindo. Eu fui com meu namorado que não tinha Instagram e em alguns lugares realmente não deixavam ele participar da ativação, mas as degustações todo mundo podia fazer independente de seguir ou não então ok…

- Parece que esse ano o pessoal de marketing de todas as marcas teve a mesma ideia, tinham umas cinco ou seis marcas que a ativação era basicamente tirar uma foto pra ganhar brinde ou algo do tipo. Acho legal, mas como eram muitas acabou saturando um pouco, gostaria que tivesse sido algo mais diferente. 

- Não precisa nem falar que comida nesse tipo de evento é muito caro, então já aviso que vá preparado porque dois tacos pequenos estavam R$38 reais, e era o mais barato que tinha💀 

Bebidas mais diferentes que gostei:

- A bebida de Misso da Naveia
- A bebida do Licor 43
- Kopenhagem + Nescafé
- Bebida de pistache da A Tal da Castanha

Bom esse é meu relato, pretendo ir no próximo ano e uma dica que vou é tentem ir cedo, cheguei no horário que abria e consegui ver quase todos os estantes que eu queria sem estar tão lotado, na hora do almoço já estava um pouco difícil de andar, principalmente no andar de baixo.

Sobre os cafés que comprei ainda não pude testar porque a torra deles é muito recente, menos de cinco dias então vou esperar a próxima semana para poder tomar, mas experimentei eles na feira e gostei bastante!!!

1lnjzui,https://www.reddit.com/r/Miscarriage/comments/1lnjzui/mmc_dc_then_chemical_pregnancy/,"MMC, D&C, then Chemical Pregnancy?","I found out in March - when I was supposed to be 11 weeks pregnant - that it was fetal demise and development stopped around 8 weeks. 
I thought I miscarried naturally by the amount of bleeding/cramping I experienced immediately after. However, in May I began having intense bleeding and cramping again. Surprise! Ultrasound showed the fetal tissue fully retained. After a month of pain and bleeding, I finally had a D&C. Bled for a week after that.. had 5 days of no bleeding and finally feeling better.. and BOOM, my first period showed up with a vengeance. 
After a rough 9 day period.. I think I had a normal cycle. However, I definitely had “TTC fatigue” after the 6 month long failed pregnancy and didn’t track things closely. 
Last week, as my period due date drew near, I started having nausea after my coffee… took an early detection test- faint positive. Took a second one the next day.. still faint, but still positive. 
Then that night, I started having some spotting, which turned into A LOT of tissue, then into raging bleeding. 
Is this just a chemical pregnancy? Was my uterine lining still too unstable after the D&C? Could something be wrong inside? 
I have an appointment next week for an ultrasound, but my doctors office gave me zero info over the phone. 
Feeling pretty defeated and devastated at the thought of 2 miscarriages back to back. 

Anyone else experience a chemical pregnancy immediately after a D&C? ",1,1751217254.0,Miscarriage,0,1.0,False
1lnjzji,https://www.reddit.com/r/christianblanco/comments/1lnjzji/world_hunger_games_4th_quinquennial_quell_25th/,World Hunger Games: 4th Quinquennial Quell (25th Hunger Games): Finale + Aftermath,"Back in the commentator’s booth, Luther was bombarded with first day reactions in many different places, from the Capital viewers to the mentor’s gallery. The comments from viewers greatly varied in subject, but most were asking one thing: why was Alyssa still alive? It seemed like everyone was angrily asking why her podium wasn’t detonated. Luther was asking the same question and called Head Gamemaker Cardew.

Cameras switched to the game making headquarters and Cardew’s face. It turned out that Cardew was very confused as she had tried on multiple occasions to detonate Alyssa’s tracker, but kept receiving interference. Her assistant Veruca Hathaway claimed that the interference couldn’t be a bug in the system and was most likely from an outside source. As if on cue, an unknown figure barged into the control room and called out for Cardew. Cardew’s eyes widened, cluing the audience into the fact she recognized the intruder. 

Hidden cameras activated to reveal the mystery intruder to be former Head Gamemaker and Cardew’s husband Balthazar Grimstone. He stumbled into the room in a drunken daze. The four peacekeepers in the room were hesitant to intervene since he technically had clearance and wasn’t initially violent. Veruca and Cardew stepped towards him to confront him. Veruca accused him of interfering with the podium explosives and Alyssa’s tracker. Grimstone smirked and said it was child’s play compared to causing the cornucopia ceiling bricks to fall. Cardew shakily told him to leave but he interrupted by revealing he finally had proof that Cardew cheated on him. Veruca paused before she could call the peacekeepers over and asked Cardew if it was true. Grimstone confirmed it by pulling out a DNA test he covertly paid for after one of Cardew’s ultrasounds. He stared at the main camera and revealed the most earth shattering secret: the baby’s father was not Grimstone but in fact President Aloysius Walt himself. 

Grimstone drunkenly laughed at Cardew’s shocked face and the tears streaming down her face, asking her if this was how wet Walt made her. Cardew slapped her husband in response, countering “I know you're not the one to talk for f\*\*\*ing Radcliffe.” Grimstone denied this claim and called her a slut before receiving another slap. Peacekeepers rushed over to separate both parties. Cardew screamed, “WALT KNEW HOW TO GIVE ME A MORE ENJOYABLE TIME THAN YOU!” The Maximus Square went ballistic by the intense drama playing on their screens. Suddenly, Grimstone soon snatched a spare guard's pistol before shooting Cardew in the abdomen. 

Chaos followed further as Grimstone took control of the gamemaker control panel and was ready to rig all of the mansions’ explosives to blow. Veruca tackled him to the ground and slammed his head against the floor. She rushed to the control panel and cancelled Grimstone’s order. More peacekeepers filed into the room to detain Grimstone and rush Cardew to the hospital to save her and her baby. With no other options, Veruca took on the role of Head Gamemaker and let the remainder of the night play out. A shell-shocked Luther gave himself a few minutes to decompress before switching back over to the games.

The *Juicy Tidbits* podcast reported on one special incident that occurred in the mentor’s gallery. Like all other mentor’s gallery content, it was shared with the public after the games. Most of the present victors were on edge due to the many events the transpired before and in the games. Quarry Grounds was on the phone with Daria’s husband Ivan while Annabeth was comforting a frazzled Tris Plummer (victor of the 8th Hunger Games). All of the other victors were dealing in their own ways, except for Spruce Queensberry (victor of the 19th Hunger Games) and Linker Nyugen (victor of the 23rd Hunger Games) who were playing video games together to take the edge off. 

Laika sneered at the two in disgust while she sat with Corpse. She suddenly had to go to the restroom as her pregnancy hormones were making her nauseous. She told Corpse not to read any live comments before leaving the room. Corpse disobeyed and began reading the comments of the first day recap. He was touched to see that the Capital loved Denton and were rooting for him. However, he noticed some rather cruel comments directed towards him and his “lack of” mentorship, ridiculing him for not doing a good enough job. 

Corpse began crying over the hurtful comments and got aggravated hearing the video games behind him. He grabbed an empty beer bottle from Mortimer Beckett (victor of the 17th Hunger Games)’s table and threw it at the wall behind the TV.. Linker paused the game and told Corpse to get a “damn grip”. Corpse got furious and told the boy he was just a measly teenager before shouting, “FIFTEEN YEARS YOU LITTLE FREAK!!!” Linker grabbed Spruce’s cigarette box and threw it at Corpse saying, “I never liked you, you tattooed freak”. 

Spruce warned Linker to not aggravate Corpse, further having to hold the boy back. Corpse chugged from a bottle of *Woeful Whiskful* and cocked his head. “You don't know the true aspect of fame, kid. You’re just a gear rat who won because he thinks he’s funny.” Linker tore into him screaming, “I WON BECAUSE OF ZOE AND JASE YOU BITCH!”. 

A large cat fight ensued but didn’t last long since Candace was ready to end it. Linker hugging her and sobbing. Candace glared at Corpse, saying “I know you're grieving but I don’t care. I have done this longer than you and you do not talk to him that way.” Candace pushed Linker out the door telling him, “You did good kid. Bacchus and Reuben are teaching you well.” Linker sadly smiled and hugged her, resulting in the thirty-nine-year-old mentor to walk Linker back to the District 3 apartments to sleep off the scary tattoo guy. 

Corpse fell back into his chair and resumed his crying. Spruce took the liquor away and told him that while he didn’t understand emotions that well, he understood where it was all coming from. “The bitch is crazier than me. I probably couldn’t have done much either.” When Laika returned, Spruce filled her in and she was upset. Corpse didn’t want to deal with his emotions and begged for a sleeping pill. Laika slapped him hard saying “You've been too much. I can't trust you watching my kids if you're going to act like this.” Corpse apologized and promised to book a few sessions with Phoebe but still remained adamant about the sleeping pill. Laika relented and retrieved a melatonin laced warmweed pill from Phineas Ellingboe (victor of the 24th Hunger Games).

The Capital was still reeling from the hectic first day of the games and the horrible revelations surrounding Grimstone and Cardew. Luther didn’t attempt to lighten the mood and was more complacent with the dour nature of the night. He assured viewers that Veruca Hathaway would try her best to salvage what was left of the games. Veruca was rung in to deliver the unfortunate news that she couldn’t bring the detonation feature on Alyssa’s tracker back online. 

However, she had an idea that could end the games sooner in another tribute’s favor. She patiently waited until sunrise to make an important announcement. Veruca congratulated the six remaining tributes for surviving before issuing a warning. She told everyone that a hoverjet would be sent into the arena to save one of them. An emergency harness would be lowered down and whomever successfully straps themselves into said harness would be declared the victor. The tributes had one hour to comply. 

All tributes were awake to hear the announcement yet were still startled by the air horn. Denton was grabbing the supplies but Stephanie told him they only needed their weapons. Denton was shaking heavily but Stephanie assured him that they would take Alyssa down together. “I’d rather take her first before anyone else. She scares me too.” 

A cannon boomed out and Luther reported the cannon to belong to Gustav (5) after he was cornered and decapitated by Jack (7)’s axe. Alyssa widely awoke squealing, “Time to see the little one.” She skipped her way to the cornucopia with her arsenal of supplies, soon noticing Stephanie and Denton running.

Stephanie and Denton were the first to arrive at the cornucopia. The two stood their ground in the center with their spear and throwing knives at the ready. Denton spotted the hoverjet’s harness dangling in the air by the cornucopia structure. Stephanie cautioned him from doing so until at least Alyssa was dead. She looked up and spotted Jack (7) charging towards them with his axe. Denton threw a knife in his direction but narrowly missed, cutting his ear. Jack flinched from the close call, giving ample time for Alyssa to stab him in the back with her glass shard. Jack grabbed her by the shirt and was about to stab her until Alyssa opened her other hand to reveal sand. She threw it in his face and stabbed him in the cheek. 

Denton urged Stephanie to take a shot with her spear, saying it would be killing “two birds with one stone”. Stephanie lined her shot and until Alyssa was standing in front of him, still gleefully stabbing Jack. She launched the spear with all her might and everyone held their breath as it flew. But Alyssa saw the spear in the corner of her eye. She jumped out of the way, allowing the spear to instead land into Jack’s chest. Jack fell to his knees and his cannon sounded seconds later. Alyssa grabbed the spear and pointed it at Denton, yelling, “You’re mine now little one. No mentor to save you this time.” 

Alyssa threw the spear back and immediately gave chase. Stephanie caught the spear but not without it nestling into her shoulder. Alyssa bypassed her and rushed towards a horrified Denton. Denton threw a knife into her left shoulder, causing her to growl in anger. Alyssa tackled the boy to the ground and tried to stab him with the glass shard. Denton slapped the shard away and bashed Alyssa with a rock, which only aggravated the girl further. She tugged on Denton’s arm hard enough to break it causing him to scream in pain. As he whimpered in pain, Alyssa retrieved her glass shard and walked back to him humming an old tune. 

Alyssa taunted the sniveling boy, calling him a little sheep. “I will miss the thrill of the chase,” she said as she raised her shard up. When all hope seemed lost for Denton, a spear exited through Alyssa’s abdomen. She turned to see Stephanie standing behind her. She chuckled and said, “Oh the slut saving the day. What a show stopper.” Stephanie kicked her to the ground. She looked at Denton and nudged in Alyssa’s direction. 

Denton crawled toward the dying Alyssa and had the final word. “Laika was right. You will die alone. No one to love you or miss you. Have fun in hell.” Denton delivered the final blow with a slash across the throat, sounded her cannon seconds later. Maximus Square was filled with triumphant cheers, finally happy Alyssa was dead.

Denton pulled himself back up and thanked her for saving him. Stephanie smiled as she picked up the glass shard and told him she was happy for him. Denton backed away and guessed they now had to fight. Stephanie apologized and said it was nothing personal. Stephanie stepped towards him but he was quick on the draw. He threw a knife at her but she blocked it with her spear. He tried again, but she blocked that one too. 

Denton was beginning to panic as his options were running out. Thinking quickly, he threw another knife but instead aimed for her leg. The knife found its target and Stephanie howled in pain. She fell forward into the sand and went still. Viewers were confused for a moment how she died so quickly until she rolled over. The glass shard she was carrying was embedded in her stomach. It appeared that she fell onto the shard after the knife wound caused her to trip. Stephanie’s cannon sounded a minute later. Back in the mentoring gallery, Quarry sadly smiled before looking at Laika saying “You got a fighter.” 

Denton smiled triumphantly and dropped his knives. He turned towards the harness and began laughing at what he saw. While he and his now fallen allies were busy fighting, Jethro had sneaked his way around the cornucopia and made it to the harness. The fifteen-year-old with curly blonde hair, tan skin, and blue eyes smiled and said, “You should have looked up when you had the chance.” 

As the hoverjet slowly lifted him in the air, Denton laughed at the sheer absurdity of the situation. He casually walked over to a knife on the ground. He said, “I didn’t want to win anyway,” before plunging the knife into his neck. As he choked on his blood, Denton gargled, “You at least tried Andrew. Thanks. See all of you in hell.” All of Panem was silent as the final cannon sounded. Hathaway announced that Jethro Castellan of District 9 was the victor of the 25th Hunger Games. Jethro was airlifted out of the arena with a smile on his face while his fans happily cheered. 

The *AfterGames* show hosted by former Head Gamemaker Deparnieux followed to keep the Capital citizens at ease while the new victor was having his eyes checked at Maximus Hospital. There was much to talk about but he was confined to a designated time frame, so he breezed through the more hectic events. The most important news was the condition of Priscilla Cardew. While she herself was expected to make a full recovery, her baby had to be put in intensive care. The bullet completely missed it but its life was still in jeopardy. The baby was a boy born six weeks early and had to be kept in the Maximus Hospital for medical surveillance. 

Cardew refused to give a full-length interview. The only thing she said was that her baby’s name is Damien and that she would always be grateful for her fans' support. While most were sympathetic to her and baby Damien’s plight, the Capital was split on other matters. Cardew confessed to cheating on her husband with President Walt and many felt sorry for Grimstone, especially since Cardew’s accusations of his infidelity hadn’t been proven yet. Nevertheless, due to her complications and the conclusion of her five year tenure, the title for Head Gamemaker was given to Veruca Hathaway. Candace Freeman was spotted cheering for her at the Dipping Downers bar alongside Bacchus Johnson (victor of the 9th Hunger Games).

Deparnieux was pressed for time, so he began talking about the games. It was unanimously agreed upon that Alyssa’s death was the highlight of the games. Deparnieux felt it poetic that Denton delivered the final blow as vengeance for all the pain she inflicted upon him. He pulled notes from District 12’s records and revealed that her familial ties to the Prospector were false. He and many viewers wondered why someone would lie about something like that, but Deparnieux decided that finding reason in the mind of a psychopath was a fruitless endeavor. 

When talking about other tributes, the Capital were upset by the premature loss of Bastion and felt robbed of seeing a potential continuation of the Golden Victor saga. The other tributes didn’t measure up to previous Golden Victors due to lack of noteworthy feats, character growth, or unresolved problems. Deparnieux wished he could dive into the unfinished story threads tributes presented but promised he would share after the victor’s interview. 

It was saddening news that the Golden Victor saga had come to an end but considered themselves lucky that someone like Jethro won the games. While not the first choice of most Capital viewers, Jethro was a satisfactory enough victor. He was also considered a redemption of sorts for District 9 after their controversial first victor and the few near victors in recent memory. Deparnieux decided that now Panem had twenty-five victors, they should be given their own name. The first twenty-five victors of the Hunger Games would now be called the Panem Knights.

Deparnieux ended the *AfterGames* show with sad news. Artemis Radcliffe had passed away four hours after the pregames interview night. Capital doctors failed to save her from the antifreeze poison cocktail Alyssa fed her. An investigation was underway to find out how Alyssa obtained the poison. Luther, the gamemaking department, and the victors were all instructed to not to announce it during the games. Luther issued a statement expressing how sad he was and that he always viewed her as a sister. He owned up to his inappropriate response on interview night, Capital Internet’s *#BackstageRage,* and apologized to Candace Freeman, her son Reuben, and all the victors for his actions. The Freeman family respected the apology and Reuben’s father Paris Dinkley refrained from pressing assault charges.

Jethro was sitting in his hospital room after his eye cleaning procedure. His mentor Tris Plummer (victor of the 8th Hunger Games) burst into the room and embraced him, overjoyed he survived. Her mother Ophelia followed closely behind and held a fruity beverage he requested. Tris and Ophelia embraced and felt a celebration at the apartment was due. Tris’s closest friends Fabeline Granger (victor of the 15th Hunger Games) and Annabeth arrived to express their congratulations to both Tris and Jethro. Tris and Ophelia laughed while Annabeth let out a dry grin. Fabeline stated that mentoring would be easier with company while Annabeth said it wouldn’t stop any late girls' nights. 

Ophelia expressed relief at finally retiring and getting to stay home in District 9. Fabeline’s face softened and she gave her Phoebe’s phone number. Jethro chimed in and asked how much he had to learn from her and Tris. Ophelia promised to give him a list. Tris laughed as all of the victors hugged each other. 

Annabeth diverted the attention back to the new victor and asked if he still wanted to be a dancer. Jethro enthusiastically nodded. Tris said she talked to Candace about getting started with stage productions before performing headlining shows. Jethro felt excited to finally live his dream, commenting how fun it would be to dance to one of Gill Henderson (victor of the 2nd Hunger Games)’s shanties. 

The group chatted for a while until District 9’s stylist Flamenco Perez came by and congratulated Jethro for his win. She gave him a beige suit and walked off with Annabeth asking “He OK?”. Tris whispered to her friend that she suspected that, like Morrana wanting Phineas to win, Perez had a close bond with Maisie. Seeing her die put the stylist in a sour mood. Ophelia offered to take Jethro to his victor's interview so the girls could spend time together, which made the others happily thank her. However, Fabeline received an unexpected phone call and had to excuse herself. 

The attendance for the victor’s interview was small as many still felt the loss of Artemis. There were still many people watching from home. Luther greeted the audience with as much enthusiasm as he could muster, but the loss of his co host was seen all over his face. He acknowledged this and told everyone that Artemis wouldn’t want him to abandon the stage and would always tell him, “Show must go on.” 

Luther warmly welcomed Jethro to the stage regardless. Jethro warmly waved at the audience before cartwheeling onto the stage which made Luther call him “Saturn Jr”. After some small pleasantries, Luther kicked off the interview excitedly telling Jethro and the audience that he was the second victor in history with a kill count of zero, after Silas MacIntyre (victor of the 7th Hunger Games). Jethro laughed and said, “Luck’s a thing too.” Luther recalled how the quell twist appeared to have zero bearing on the games outcome and asked him if his ADHD came in his favor. Jethro shrugged and said, ""Uhhh I guess. I didn’t know I had it until your friend told me.” 

The games themselves came up and Jethro admitted to feeling terrified whilst being chased by Alyssa. Luther read comments of viewers who were surprised by his speed. Jethro smiled and said he would play tag with his friends during work in the corn fields and was an expert at hiding from annoyed peacekeepers. Luther chuckled as Jethro gave a childish smile saying, “They called me the corn scarecrow.” 

Luther asked how he felt not being considered a Golden Victor. Jethro said he didn’t care about the title and that being alive is all that mattered. When asked what he wanted to do with his life, Jethro said he wanted to be a dancer and a baker. Luther smiled before telling him his victor's nickname to be “Ghost Crow”, for his luck and speed. Jethro smiled and said he loved that nickname. He was dismissed to moderate applause.

The *Juicy Tidbits* podcast began airing their latest Hunger Games special the day after the victor’s interview had concluded. Viewers were hoping for answers about Alyssa’s history and Stephanie’s beef with Donald Emerson. The podcast featured two special guests: former District 7 mentor and acclaimed author and historian Armitage Blake, and Jasper Deparnieux of the *AfterGames* show. Blake presented the extensive research he underwent following his diagnosis of Alyssa being a sadistic psychopath. He revealed that she indeed poisoned a fellow prisoner and threatened the only witness, the prison lunch lady, to keep quiet. When questioned why Alyssa lied about her relations with the Prospector, Blake didn’t have a definitive answer, “For attention, sponsors, cause hysteria, personal enjoyment, who knows?” 

Deparnieux was given the privilege to tell Donald Emerson’s story. There wasn’t official evidence confirming Stephanie’s testimony and every other classmate in Emerson’s class denied ever being flirted with. Blake butted in and said that it wasn’t farfetched to think that Stephanie lied since she was displaying very flirtatious behavior on the runway and in her interview. His guess was that she made the first move and he reciprocated at first before turning her down. Emerson was called in for his side of the story. He confirmed Blake’s theory and said he turned Stephanie down because he was trying to remain faithful to his wife after cheating on her once already back in the Capital. There was still no evidence to support either side and both guests were fine with not having a definitive answer. Deparnieux lamented that Artemis would’ve enjoyed the story a lot and probably would’ve made comparisons with Ashley Chen (victor of the 13th Hunger Games)’s story. Blake added on, “Or make excuses defending Stephanie.”

Jethro didn’t want to stay in the Capital for long. However, he was convinced to a quick stop for coffee at the Java Juniper where he met Linker Nyugen (victor of the 23rd Hunger Games). Jethro returned home to District 9 with a warm and loving welcome. The district was overcome with joy that another of their children had returned home. He had an emotional reunion with his parents and seven sisters, practically tumbling into him when he landed. Jethro moved his whole family into Victor's Village while Ophelia helped distribute the year’s food supply. 

A month after his return, Jethro received a call from Candace’s husband, famous actor Paris Dinkley. Paris offered to help him start his dancing career with a show at the Golden Globe Theater. There wasn’t time to prepare for the current year’s show, so Jethro was offered a role in a musical. While Jethro was over the moon, he made it clear he had no desire to act. Candace hopped onto the call and assured him the musical was for dancers. Jethro would have to spend two months in District 1 after next year’s games for rehearsals and the show itself. Jethro didn’t like the idea of spending time away from family, but reluctantly agreed after his family encouraged it.

Jethro used the free time to commence his other dream of becoming a baker. He put his victor’s earnings to good use and started his own bakery *My Soul to Bake* and employed some of his family. The business became very successful and peacekeepers became regular customers. He personally baked care packages for the victors he would meet during the reaping tour for the 26th Hunger Games with information given to him by Phoebe Bentley (victor of the 3rd Hunger Games). The stop in District 2 was emotional as Jethro gifted Daria and Ivan an eight layer chocolate cake. Daria, who had been recovering from her grief, broke down in tears and hugged Jethro, thanking him for being at least sane. 

The stress Jethro felt stepping into that district paled in comparison to the rigid tension he was sensing while touring District 12. Thankfully, there was no bad blood with many of the citizens applauding him for his win. Jethro had a pleasant tour with Laika and learned that the revelations surrounding Alyssa’s crimes called for a retrial for her prison boyfriend Pacifius. Pacifius was promptly released and later employed at one of the oil companies she oversees, allowing him and his grandmother to come out of poverty. Jethro got along quite well with Laika and got to meet her twins Francie and Colton. Corpse showed signs of feeling better after some sessions with Phoebe and quality time with his family. Jethro gave Laika and her four kids a care package before he wrapped up his tour. 

Jethro’s debut on the Golden Globe stage was a big success and spelled the start of an illustrious career in dance. By the 32nd Hunger Games, Jethro’s success became so overwhelming that he had to relocate to the Capital where his presence was requested the most. He passed the bakery on to two of his sisters. It was through one of his biggest plays, the ensemble *Ghost Trolley,* that he met his wife actress Freya Wittinghouse. The two married after the 6th Quinquennial Quell and had four kids. 

Jethro got along very well with most of the victors. He grew closest to Tris and was very accommodating to her many needs. He continued to care for her until she retired from the mentor role after the 7th Quinquennial Quell (40th Hunger Games). Jethro also grew close to most of the Capital residing victors, except Spruce Queensberry (victor of the 19th Hunger Games) whom he would avoid as much as possible due to vaguely reminding him of Alyssa. This wasn’t the case with Corpse and Linker Nguyen (victor of the 23rd Hunger Games). The two victors helped prepare Jethro for the world of showbiz and provided great advice and shoulders to cry on.

Things seemed to be going very well for Jethro until before the 49th Hunger Games when he divorced his wife Freya. A downward spiral was inevitable as he fell into alcoholism and began spouting ramblings, calling himself a dancing monkey and show pony. His dancing career took a hit after one failed performance not long after the 9th Quinquennial Quell (50th Hunger Games). He had a mental breakdown mid performance and crazily claimed to have been forced to perform in the Capital. He yelled at the audience members, accusing them of ruining his passion. 

Jethro was forcibly checked into the Gaul Psychiatric Care facility and held there until the 51st Hunger Games. Thankfully, his mental state improved when that year’s victor enabled him to retire and return home to District 9, reuniting with his family and Tris. Jethro became very vocal on the Capital’s injustices and remained adamant that he was forced to perform in the Capital, going as far as to claim they threatened to kill one of his sisters. He would often be protesting at the town hall in the days leading up to the next games, even being thrown in jail in a few instances. Jethro and other District 9 victors would often discourage their tributes from signing any contracts and pursuing dreams in the Capital. 

After the 14th Quinquennial Quell (75th Hunger Games), Tris passed away from a heart attack. Jethro and his family were abducted by the underground resistance group, the Phoenix Fighters, moments after her funeral. Jethro became a valued member of the resistance and was reported to be responsible for the assasination of both Hunger Games hosts Hilarius Logan and Vipsania Taylor. He played a vital role in the liberation of District 9 after the 82nd Hunger Games; the same liberation that cost Phineas Ellingboe (victor of the 24th Hunger Games) his life. Jethro was one of four Panem Knights to live to see the Capital’s fall and was inducted as mayor of his district. He died peacefully in his bed nine years later, surrounded by loved ones.",1,1751217235.0,christianblanco,0,1.0,False

SW: 185 | CW: 154 | GW: 140

I’m on Day 7 of my 3rd annual extended fast (just water, black coffee, and electrolytes) and feeling incredible. My personal record is 8 days, and I’ll definitely be beating that this year.

I started getting serious about my health on August 17, 2024. After years of yo-yo dieting, something finally clicked. I’ve been working not just on my body, but on healing emotional patterns that kept me stuck in the cycle. For me what’s worked is mind-body-spirit alignment and fasting is a huge part of that.

Over the last 10 months, I’ve used a mix of rolling fasts (ranging from 42–72 hours) and low-carb eating to lose weight steadily. There were stretches where I locked in hard, and other times where I slipped up, fell off from fasting, ate like crap, and gained 5-7 pounds back. The difference now compared to all of my yo-yo cycles in the past is that I gave myself grace and got back to fasting, better food choices, and moving my body. That’s the biggest shift this time: self-compassion and consistency.

After this extended fast, I’ll be doing Alternate Day Fasting, daily exercise to tone up, and eating carnivore for a while to address the skin issues I’m experiencing. 

Fasting works. If you stay consistent and patient, the results come. You’ve got this!!!",152,1751217185.0,fasting,11,0.99,False

Just finished up a really bad house sit and my god, this app is seriously hit or miss!! We have had two epic sits and our most recent one was the third. 

1. ant infestation in the kitchen. Poison was down on the bench but there was still so many throughout the pantry
2. Invited us to stay the night before, we stayed in a room with so many dead wasps, blowflies and other misc insects all over the floor and the bed, and rats clambering about in the roof, you could hear them squeaking. Owner said we could move to a downstairs room the next night, so we did. Had a ensuite bathroom attached with no door and there was this seriously unholy stench coming from the drain, so bad that we ended up just taking the sheets downstairs and sleeping on the couch for the entire sit as you couldn’t be in the bedroom without gagging. The cleaner came around and I mentioned the smell and she was like, oh yeah it’s always like that lol.🥲 
3. Has a dishwasher, we were confused why all the dishes seemed dirty once coming out, looked at the dishwasher and it’s got so much food coated and hardened through the racks so instead of silver/grey they look brown. So basically it’s never gonna clean anything that goes in.
4. Coffee Perculator left on the bench with coffee in it from before we even got there
5. About three handfuls worth of miscellaneous brown food throughout all the racks and on the bottom of the oven 
6. Rotting fruit with green mould and covered in fruit flies left on the bench 
7. Literally every plate and bowl in the cupboard is dirty, like one plate was legit covered in dry sauce, some covered in cooked rice grains, curry, etc
8. Tea towels in the kitchen hanging up with food chunks on them
9. For 4 days there was a builder here rebuilding the front indoor step, using a chainsaw , grouting and laying tiles (so we couldn’t use the front door for 24 hours because it would’ve damaged the drying grout/tiles if we opened it). He was in and out randomly - twice he was there 9am-7pm.
10. Painter came round to paint a wall in the hallway (like what the f?!)
11. Guy came around to spray paint and redo the fireplace (again, ?!!) 

I could go on and on, that’s not even all of it. I would personally never leave my house in this state to have people stay at. Why would you organise repairs and renovations to your house when you have people staying?! Also why don’t people just clean up after themselves!

We come from a very non confrontational, just get on with it and move on culture so we didn’t say anything to the owner, we were just ecstatic to leave. We have about 8 sits lined up in the not to distant future and really hoping we don’t get another like that one! 

Honestly just can’t believe the state in which some HO’s leave their house in! Whats some horror stories from sits you’ve had in the past?! Would love to hear!

1lnjy8f,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1lnjy8f/rant_and_advice_if_possible/,Rant and advice if possible,"I’m kinda at my wits end with my roommate, we’re friends who moved in together about 6 months ago and it started out fun but over time I’ve started to dread coming home 

Don’t get me wrong she’s still one of my best friends but I’m not enjoying living together anymore as things have started to slip on her end 

She doesn’t do her side of the chores anymore, leaves everything for me, there’s always pasta, rice or burnt egg residue in the sink (don’t ask me how as she doesn’t do the washing up anymore) dirty dishes and food scraps are always left on the coffee table which means food gets welded on, becomes impossible to clean and smells 

So she works from home every day except for Saturdays so the amount of dishes accumulates over the day, where as I’m out of the house 5 days a week and only eat when I get home from work so usually have a cup and a bowl which needs to be cleaned as opposed to all of the dishes she’s used. I’ve suggested in the past us washing up our own stuff that we’ve used but she said it would be difficult since we’ve only got one lot of pans and if one of us hasn’t done it then the other will have to (ironic that she now isn’t cleaning anything!) 

I’m aware that when she’s home most of the time she’s working, however every day I come home she’s led on the sofa playing games and I have to run around cleaning up all the mess she’s made throughout the day which is incredibly infuriating considering none of the mess was mine, don’t get me wrong household chores are communal and I’m happy to do my part but it should be split evenly and at the moment I’m doing it all 

We have issues with hot water and due to her taking hour long showers, it means I’m constantly left with no hot water and have to wash up the dishes with boiled water from the kettle and haven’t been able to have a hot shower in months

Any of my things that I put throughout the house in our communal areas are always put in my room by the time I come home from work despite her having all of her stuff everywhere 

I’ve tried doing the whole stop doing her stuff for her and she’ll eventually do it, but it leads to even worse mess that she will never clean up, I’ve also spoken to her about her long showers multiple times but she keeps doing it 

I’m basically being treated like her parent, there were warning signs at first (which I now feel stupid for ignoring) such as the bills not being paid on time (money comes out of my account directly and she transfers it to me), I would then have to chase her for it and she’d say that she didnt know it was due or how much it was despite me explaining multiple times that the bills are the same every month, they go out on the same day every month and that if anything changes I would let her know immediately, I even provided her with a paper and electronic list of dates and amounts for the bills but it was still late 

She will also leave the house and not let me know what time she’s coming home (or if she is at all) which wouldn’t be an issue as she’s an adult and can do what she wants, however we have a deadbolt on the door which we put across at night for safety, however when I don’t know what time she’s coming home (or if she is) I have to sleep without it which makes me feel unsafe, then when she does come home she wakes me up at ridiculous times in the morning

I’m also the main person our landlord communicates with, which is becoming taxing considering we’re having issues with mould which my roommate is deeming my problem to fix with the landlord and to clean up around the house despite it mainly appearing on her belongings (I threw away and replaced all of my things that were effected) 
I’m disabled and chronically ill so having to live in a mouldy home (which has been making me ill) and having to pick up after someone else and try to keep everything in order is becoming too much

I’m desperate to move out as I’ve become so unhappy here but we’re on a fixed term contract and still have time left on our tenancy, I’ve considered speaking to the landlord as she is lovely and I know would be understanding but at the same time, I know my roommate can’t afford to live anywhere else and wouldn’t be able to afford paying the rent if I leave and I don’t have the money to be able to pay the rent here, all the other bills and a mortgage and bills on where I would be living if I leave early (I plan on buying my next home as I never wanted to rent however my roommate needed somewhere to live and nowhere would accept her because her earnings were too low on her own) 

Sorry for the long post, I’m just so frustrated and feel like I’m stuck in a bad situation, if anyone has any advice I’m all ears, if not thank you for listening to me ramble on!

1lnjxkd,https://i.redd.it/qpxcazchfw9f1.png,The Morphic Hustle Part III,"Later that night, I went home and did everything Bill instructed me to do.

Except this time, my heart wasn’t in it. Not like before.

I’m tired. I just want my life back—the way it was before the demons, before people started yelling at mangoes.

I sighed and went to bed, wishing I could rewind everything. Even if it meant losing my new empire.
It’s not worth it anymore.

As I drifted off to sleep, I began to dream.

I’m in some kind of cemetery, and there’s a man yelling in the distance. As I walk toward him, his form begins to shift. With all the weird things I’ve seen lately, I don’t even flinch. I dig into my pocket, pull out a lighter and a pack of cigarettes.

“Smoke ’em if you got ’em,” I mutter.

Then the man transforms into the screaming demon.

“We are legion!” it roars.

I roll my eyes. “How original.”

Then I drop my cigarette—because someone walks up to the demon, and it starts twisting in pain. It howls, “It’s not your time! Let us enter the beasts in the field!”

Suddenly, the ground splits beneath me. I’m in free fall—like the earth opened its throat and swallowed me whole.

As I plummet, I see lightning tearing through the darkness. But it’s not lightning. Not really.

It moves with purpose. With form.

An angel—falling like lightning.

Then I’m awake.

Sweating. Gasping for air.

And there’s Bill, sitting at my kitchen table, drinking my tea like he owns the place.

“You little brat,” he growls. “You couldn’t leave well enough alone? Could’ve just ridden my little demonic ride straight into a corner office and died.”

“B-Bill?” I whisper.

“Stop with that stupid name, will you!” He slams my mug down so hard it shatters.

“I just want it to stop. I want my mind back. Please,” I beg.

He just laughs. Deep belly-shaking laughter—until he morphs into that same nameless, demonic bastard.

“You were him all along!?” I shout, more pissed than I’ve ever been.

“Kid, I ain’t giving you shit back. You’re too far gone. Got too many people making deals, buying into my kingdom. I’d be stupid to let you go now. We had an agreement.”

Then he vanishes—flipping me the double bird as he goes.

---

The next morning, I can’t stop thinking about Bill, the field, and the dream.

The dream.
I need to find an angel.

I hop in my Acura and drive to a Catholic church I once saw in passing.

As I pull up, I don’t see a demon yelling. I see an angel.Floating above the church.

Its wings look like glass, catching the light of the sun.

Only one word comes to mind.
“Beautiful,” I whisper.

I go inside. No talking points. No idea what I’m doing.

Am I really about to tell a priest about demons, the morphic field, and an angel floating over his church?

He’s going to call the cops.

Inside, a man stands tall, gazing at a crucifix.

I feel more uncomfortable than if I were wearing sandpaper boxers. I turn to leave.

“Hello, young man,” I hear behind me. His voice is smooth—like bourbon. “Can I help you?”

“I think I’m lost, is all,” I stammer. Like a kid caught sneaking a candy bar before dinner.

“That’s a good place to start,” he says, gesturing toward a pew.

I tell him everything.
Ironically, confessing to a priest how I capitalized on demonic influence.

I expect holy water, Latin chanting, an exorcism.
But none of that comes.

“I’ve heard of the morphic field,” he says. “Or something like it, in my studies.”

I’m shocked.

“Demons only have power when you give it to them,” he says. “This field you talk about? It only works if you believe in it. Turn your attention to the angels instead. Let them fight for you, my son.”

I walk out like I’m ready for battle.
I glance up at the angel above the church and start second-guessing if I really am.

---

On my drive to the office, the dream replays in my head.
That angel, too.

Then something nags at me—something a friend once said after Bible camp as a kid:

> “Satan used to be the Light Bearer. He was cast out of Heaven like a bolt of lightning.”

My blood runs cold.

Sweat pools.

I blow through a red light—horns blaring behind me.

I should’ve left well enough alone.

The Catholic Church and the morphic field—two sides of the same damn coin.
I’m still being played.

Demons are just angels with their wings clipped to keep them from flying away.

How stupid could I have been?

---

I stay up all night.

Red Bulls. Five-Hour Energy. Dubstep blasting in my ears.

Trying to think my way out.

I can do this on my own. Right?

Then I remember the man in my dream.
The one who walked right up to Legion.
Who was he?
Who has the power to make a demon beg like that?

One more time. When the sun rises, I’ll find another church.

Hopefully, one like my friend went to at Bible camp.

---

As the sun rises, I’m getting dressed for work.

I turn my phone back on.

I set it down—but it starts vibrating like it wants to punch through the table.

Too many voicemails.

Then a flood of texts.
All from my regional manager.

Same topic. Over and over.
My office went up in smoke.

He’s worried. I didn’t answer.

Well, no point in going there now.

I head to the Acura. Start the engine.
My body moves on instinct—like I’m being guided.

A few lights, a few turns, and I end up at a humble little church tucked into a quiet neighborhood I’d never have found on my own.

I look around.
No statues. No angels. No demons.
Just quiet.

I walk up to the front office.

I meet a guy who looks like Peter Parker in another life.

He’s smiling like life is a gift. But his eyes—they’ve seen war.

He takes me to his office. I lay it all out.

Then he asks something different:
“Do you think you’re a good person?”

“Well, yeah. I stop at stop signs. Donate to hospitals. Never litter. I’d say I’m a good guy.”

He walks over to a coffee maker. Pours a cup. Offers me one.

I accept.

Then he looks me dead in the eyes.

“None of that proves you’re a good person. That’s just following the rules. Good deeds. Good manners.”

I’m confused.

What does this have to do with anything?

Then he continues.

“That man you saw in your dream? He is a good man. The only good man to walk the Earth.”

He sips his coffee like it’s holy truth.

“Demons are afraid of Him. Angels bow to Him. We? We look to Him for forgiveness.”

I never mentioned the angel. The one from my dream or the church. I omitted those details. Why is he bringing up angels?

His voice softens.

“All of us are sinners, deserving of Hell. That’s the truth. God expects perfection. We fall short. We try to bridge the gap with good deeds, but it’ll never be enough.”

My chest tightens.

This isn’t helping. I’m angry.

“Jesus can give you the freedom you want. Your mind back. But only if you accept the truth—you deserve Hell. But Jesus took your place. He died so you wouldn’t have to. When Hell saw He was sinless, death had no power over Him.”

“So I’m going to Hell?” I ask, standing.

“Only if you keep fighting alone. I can’t force you. I can only tell you the truth. Jesus already won. You just need to accept it. Admit your guilt. Accept His love. And let the Holy Spirit fight in you.”

“Th–thanks,” I say quietly, walking out.

---

I start driving toward my company’s main branch.

Then I do something I’ve never tried before.

I pray.

I confess everything—why I did it, how selfish I was.
I ask for forgiveness. I ask for help.

I pull over.

I’m across the street from the Summit Inn. Or where it used to be.
Burned down.

And for the first time since coming to the desert,
I feel peace.

I never visited the main branch. Never checked the damage of my own branch.

I Just went home. 

I finally slept.

A full night.

I owe my life to Jesus.

All I had to do was admit my mistakes.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/stayawake/comments/1lkvy51/a\_face\_too\_familiar\_the\_isaac\_merrin\_case/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stayawake/comments/1lkvy51/a_face_too_familiar_the_isaac_merrin_case/)

It's been about 3 weeks since last. Lt. Rourke gave me time off work to cope with what I went through. I’ve been attending therapy sessions every few days, trying to get my head straight. I keep replaying the incident in my head. How did… *it*… Get the body out of the grave and get it to the apartment in such a short time? How did it know I was going to be there? Why did it try to attack me? My heart begins to race at the speed of light when I ponder the circumstances. So far, the therapy sessions have been going well. The therapist assigned to me is a sweet lady who truly understands what I'm going through. All was good… until it wasn’t.

I left my therapy session early, as I was gonna go and see the fellas at the station for a surprise visit. I really missed those guys. As I was stepping into my car, I peered at myself in the reflection of the black paint. For whatever reason, something looked off about me. I wasn’t sure if it was due to the stress I've been under lately, but I looked so… expressionless. My skin was a grayer tone, and my eyes were deep, yet empty-looking. I actually chuckled at first, I looked like shit. Pale, tired, and rough. Made sense, given the hell I’ve been through. However, the longer I stared, the more eerie it felt, like I was staring at a stranger. I quickly shuffled into the car and took a deep breath. I summed it up to my trauma playing tricks on me, and tried to stay strong. I started the car and switched the radio to the local rock station to calm down. I rolled the windows down and let the breeze comfort me.

I arrived at the station just before 3:00 pm. Constable Mercer was the first to spot me as I stepped inside. He came over and shook my hand, and asked how I was holding up. I gave him the usual half-answer, “Still breathing.” I wandered down the hall, stopping into a few offices to say hello. Some smiled, some looked surprised to see me. Everyone meant well, but I could tell they didn’t quite know what to say. I didn’t blame them.

My last stop was Lt. Rourke’s office. I knocked on the door lightly, just as I did before, and opened the door with respect. When I entered, Rourke shuffled a folder into his filing cabinet. I knew what it was. The Merrin case, freshly updated as a murder investigation instead of a self-inflicted death. “Hey, Brenner! Nice to see you. How ya’ doing?” he said with a smile, but I could tell his mind wasn’t on the conversation; it was still stuck on what I’d been through. “I'm alright, how's the investigation coming along?” I curiously asked. “Hey man, let's not talk about that right now, you don't need to relive that,” he responded. I simply nodded and broke eye contact with him, peering at the floor, staring at his shiny dress shoes. He continued, “I'm sorry, Brenner…” he said quietly. “What for? It's not your fault,” I stated. “I should have closed the case myself… I just wanted it done, so I threw it on you to ease my workload. I’m truly sorry,” he said, his voice getting softer as he spoke. I figured as much anyway. 

We briefly spoke for a moment before I got up to leave. As I gripped the golden handle, Lt. Rourke spoke. “Hey Brenner, one last thing,” he said. “Yeah, what is it?” I responded. “Why did you go to Merrin’s apartment in the first place? What was the loose end you had to tie up?” he asked. I froze. I had lied to him originally about my true intentions. “There… was no loose end… as I read the file, I couldn't help but notice that some of the details weren’t adding up, so… I decided to investigate it myself,” I responded sternly, backing up my prior decision. “Jesus Brenner, please don’t lie to me again. You almost got killed…” he said, disappointment in his voice. 

In that moment, emotion overcame me. ""Well if you hadn’t jumped to conclusions and actually investigated the Merrin case properly, Then maybe I wouldn’t have been nearly fucking killed!” With that, I slammed his door and stormed down the hall. On my way to the front entrance, I spotted my photo on a bulletin board, pinned with a thumb-tack. I glanced at it for a moment before freezing in place. The photo… was like the reflection in the car. I looked so uncanny. My eyes were unnaturally wide, and my expression was soulless. What unsettled me most wasn’t just the expression… It was the fact that this photo was taken over a year ago. And yet I looked exactly like I did this morning, staring back at myself in the car. 

I quickly left, feeling overwhelmed by the day's events. I pulled into my driveway and headed inside my home. I live in a quiet community on the outskirts of town. Every neighbor is separated by a large expanse of woods, so everyone tends to keep to themselves. I neatly placed my shoes to the side and headed into the kitchen. I grabbed a cold beer from the fridge and threw some leftovers in the microwave. I fell onto the couch and began to enjoy my meal while watching television, just trying to relax. I channel-surfed until I found a baseball game on the sports channel. I sank deeper into the couch and let myself breathe for once. The room was quiet, the kind of quiet that almost felt earned. One of the players struck out, which ended the inning. The network cut to a slow-motion highlight of the pitch. The camera followed the ball as it traveled to home plate. As it reached the glove of the back catcher, the camera froze in place for a moment, showing the ball entering the glove and the missed swing. I took a sip of my beer and peered back toward the television. That's when I saw… it… again… For the 3rd time. Standing behind home plate in the stands. Everyone around him was focused on the batter, eyes adjacent to the left of the camera. But it was just staring straight into the lens, almost as if it was looking at me at that very moment. I quickly shut the TV off and took a deep breath. I chugged the rest of my beer, trying to calm my nerves. I stared back at the now black screen before switching the TV on again. I held my breath as my finger hovered over the power button. With a great deal of pressure, I pressed the button. The TV flashed on, showing a wide shot of the field and the players walking out onto it for the start of the new inning.  I took a breath, chalking it up to my imagination. The camera began to move to the right, showing the far corner of the foul line. The camera suddenly made a sharp jolt to the right, filling the screen with… my face. The TV’s volume turned to max, out of my control. The screech that I was too familiar with rang out, almost deafening me. I grabbed the remote and began to spam the power button, but to no avail. I ran over to the outlet and swiftly ripped the plug out from the TV, cutting its power in one panicked motion. The room fell into a heavy silence, just the sound of my breathing, fast and uneven. Something was seriously wrong. This couldn't be real.

I stood there for a few seconds, trying to convince myself it was all in my head. But it wasn’t. I could feel it in my chest. This was different. I ran to check my home security app, as I have a security camera in my house, after a break-in occurred a few years back. The footage cuts off right as I sit down to relax, and the footage only starts again after I open the app to review it. I began to feel as if I was in danger. Fight or Flight rushed through my body in one fluid motion. I ran into the bedroom and slammed the door shut. I turned the lock and slowly backed up from the door. It was here. It had to be, why else would I feel this way? It’s almost like I knew, as it is… me. I peered over to the closet and spotted my gun safe, snugly tucked into the corner behind some suitcases. I ran over and began to type the code in. My shaky hands made it difficult to get the right one. Finally, after 3-4 attempts, the door clicked. I grabbed my hunting rifle and cocked it. I knew it was coming, I just didn’t know when. 

I waited for hours. I watched the light dance across the floor as the hours passed. I was too afraid to move an inch. I just sat on my bed with my rifle, waiting for it to show up. Day quickly faded to night. Exhaustion began to overcome me. I caught myself slipping in and out of sleep. The feeling that it was coming had left my mind at this point, and I let my guard down. I gently placed the rifle to my left and swung my legs out of bed. At this point, my legs were pins and needles from the lack of movement, I wouldn't dare to move a muscle earlier. I paused a moment before I unlocked the door, waiting to see if anything felt off. 

Nothing felt wrong. It had been a few hours since any incident had happened. I started to question whether my mind was truly playing tricks on me all along… or if this was all really happening. Nevertheless, I turned the lock and opened the door, its hinges creaking. I stuck my head out into the hall and assessed my home. It was pitch black in the main room, except for a single lamp I left on in the corner by the couch. I crept out into the hallway, my back adjacent to the far wall as I moved. As I reached the main room, I inspected my surroundings, ensuring everything looked as it had a few hours before. I checked the coffee table first. My leftovers, now cold, was right where I left it. The empty beer bottle also remained in the same place as before. I looked around a bit more. I am a detective after all. Looking around is what I do. Nothing else seemed out of the ordinary. I walked over to my front door and peeked out the blind that covered the window. The street was dark, only illuminated by an orange street light across the street. Behind that, miles upon miles of dense forest. 

I stepped back from the blind and began to walk toward the kitchen when my foot knocked something across the floor. My shoe. I could have sworn I placed them neatly next to the door. Why was it lying in the middle of the floor? As I pondered the question, something began to feel odd, as if I was being watched from behind. I slowly turned around and peered at the front door, specifically near the crack in the blinds. I stared for a moment before approaching it once again. Slowly this time. The closer I got to the door, the more uneasy I felt. I lowered my head and closed my left eye, peeking out with my right. It was pitch black. The streetlight was powered off. I couldn't see anything. I squinted harder, trying to make out something from the dark. That’s when it hit me. The porch light. It should have lit up the steps. It always did. But this time… nothing. Just black. Something was blocking it. I leaned in closer, holding my breath. And then it shifted… just barely. The faintest twitch. A curve. A ripple. A reflection. It was an eyeball… My eyeball… pressed against the glass. Staring in. 

I jolted back so fast I lost my footing and crashed onto my back. I scurried across the floor like an animal, eyes still locked on the door. The front door calmly opened, and it walked inside, as if it owned the place. I struggled my way to the bedroom, attempting to get the rifle. Right as I made it to the door, my ankle was clenched by its hand. It dragged me back out into the main room and flipped me over. It began to relentlessly beat me, all while maintaining that empty stare. Blood began to cover my eyes. In a desperate attempt to break free, I kicked it right in the stomach with every bit of power I had left in my body. It repulsed onto the back wall with a thud, letting out its distinct screech. I scrambled to the kitchen with haste and grabbed a large knife that sat on the counter. Without thinking, I immediately swung it back, slicing it right on the chest, creating a deep gash. It screeched once again, this time backing off a bit. I managed to stand up, brandishing the knife at its face. For a moment, it just sat there, staring at me. 

I'm not sure what prompted me to do this, but I began to approach it. As I got closer, it began to back up toward the still-open front door. As it crept out onto the front porch, it stopped in its tracks. It began to raise its arm, turning its palm upwards. Confused, I screamed at it. “GET THE FUCK BACK, MOTHEFUCKER!”. Its mouth opened slowly. I was expecting it to screech again, until it began to speak. “Follow,” it said in a raspy whisper, gesturing for me to come forward. “GO TO HELL ASSHOLE, JUST END THIS NIGHTMARE ALREADY. COME ON!” I screamed, challenging it. I didn't care if I lived or died. I just wanted this to be over. 

It repeated itself once again. “Follow”. Was this some attempt to trap me, or… was it trying to show me something? It began to back up down the steps, as it continued gesturing. “FUCK YOU,” I shouted, pointing the tip of the blade toward it. It continued to move for a moment before it stopped in its tracks. Sounds began to fade. The sound of the trees brushing in the wind ceased, and the crickets went quiet. The world had seemed to hold its breath. Suddenly, it opened its mouth wider than humanly possible,  its jaw cracking outward like a dislocated puppet. It let out its awful screech and began charging toward the door. 

I jumped forward and slammed it shut, sending the mimic tumbling down the steps. I flicked the lock and ran toward the bedroom. I picked up the rifle from the bed and threw the strap over my shoulder. I aimed it toward the bedroom door and waited. I’d pissed it off. That much was clear to me. Sooner or later, it would rush me again. But this time, I would pump it full of bullets. If one bullet to the head killed Isaac’s mimic, then multiple bullets should do the trick just fine. The silence was deafening. 

As I watched the door, the hairs on my neck stood up. There it was again. That feeling. The feeling that ‘it’ was watching me. The feeling of not being alone. I swung around with great speed toward the large bedroom window and began to open fire. Glass and chunks of drywall began to fly around the room. I emptied half the magazine before letting my finger off the trigger. I took a breath and began to slowly approach the now-shattered window. Lying just under the window was the mimic, now full of bullet wounds. It began to shuffle away, using its heels to slowly scoot backward. I aimed my rifle at its head. Without hesitation, I pulled the trigger. I watched as its head jerked backwards onto the grass. Its chest stopped rising. 

Sounds began to return. The crickets returned to their normal volume. The sounds of the forest returned. I threw the rifle over my shoulder onto my back and ran for the phone. I dialed Rourke's number and told him everything that had occurred that day. Not long after, multiple squad cars pulled onto my grass, and a dozen cops rushed into the house and backyard. Behind them, a black van. A few men in expensive suits rushed into the backyard along with the officers. I watched from the window as they began to inspect its body. One stated “No pulse”. One of the suited men wheeled a stretcher over and placed its body onto it. They loaded it into the van and sped off, as if they were never here in the first place. I spent the rest of the night at the station with my colleagues. They offered me support at this time. One grabbed me a change of clothes, as my other clothes were scuffed from the fight. Another sat with me, trying to distract me with old, funny stories of me and him together. I appreciated their efforts, but nothing was going to truly help me after what had just occurred.

After an hour or so at the station, one of the men in black suits showed up and requested a private interview back in the van. I reluctantly agreed, and we headed into the parking lot and approached the vehicle. The man knocked in a strange code-like way, and both doors swung open. Sitting in the back were 2 more men in suits, and the stretcher with my.. Its… body lying on it. They brought me inside and began to question me. Stuff like “When was the first time you had seen this man?” and “Did you experience any abnormal experiences prior to the incident at your home tonight?”. I answered their questions honestly, and after some back and forth for about 15 minutes, they concluded their interview. The man closest to the door opened it to let me out. Before I exited, I turned around and peered at the body one more time. There it lay, dead. With a face I see every morning. A face too familiar. I watched the van speed off into the distance, turning onto the road out of sight. I was now alone in the parking lot. I stared at the night sky and its stars for a moment, questioning everything I had ever known and experienced. As I glanced at the moon, I got the feeling again. Like I was being watched.

I quickly whipped around, only to see Lt. Rourke walking toward me. “Hey Brenner, you ok, pal? What just happened? What did they want?” he said. “I think… they were government agents,” I responded, my breath calming. “Jesus Christ. Come on inside with the rest of us. We're gonna stay with you for a while to calm your nerves. Officer Hennessey left to get some coffee and donuts for you and the guys,” he said. I could use a coffee right about now. We headed back inside together. The station was quiet. Maybe the worst was finally behind me. I sat down and sank into the chair, and for the first time in a long time, I felt normal. As if I had won the battle.",2,1751217093.0,stayawake,0,1.0,False

I was making a cake and got to the part where I was adding hot coffee to rest on my cocoa powder to bring out the chocolatey flavor right before mixing in the wet ingredients when my power went out. I’m still trying to get maintenance to see if they can fix anything, but will I have to start over if my wet ingredients (eggs, vegetable oil, milk) and dry ingredients (with coffee) are left sitting for longer than an hour?

I ask because I’m new to baking, but Im acutely aware of how the chemistry of baking is an art and don’t know if leaving ingredients out, refrigerating to preserve, etc. will effect how the cake will turn out.

(For more info: it’s boxed cake mix. Just wanted to elevate the chocolate flavor and moistness and mostly focus on the buttercream. However, it is my second attempt and eggs— and all ingredients tbh—  are so expensive nowadays 😣)",2,1751217000.0,AskBaking,8,1.0,False

It's been about 3 weeks since last. Lt. Rourke gave me time off work to cope with what I went through. I’ve been attending therapy sessions every few days, trying to get my head straight. I keep replaying the incident in my head. How did… *it*… Get the body out of the grave and get it to the apartment in such a short time? How did it know I was going to be there? Why did it try to attack me? My heart begins to race at the speed of light when I ponder the circumstances. So far, the therapy sessions have been going well. The therapist assigned to me is a sweet lady who truly understands what I'm going through. All was good… until it wasn’t.

I left my therapy session early, as I was gonna go and see the fellas at the station for a surprise visit. I really missed those guys. As I was stepping into my car, I peered at myself in the reflection of the black paint. For whatever reason, something looked off about me. I wasn’t sure if it was due to the stress I've been under lately, but I looked so… expressionless. My skin was a grayer tone, and my eyes were deep, yet empty-looking. I actually chuckled at first, I looked like shit. Pale, tired, and rough. Made sense, given the hell I’ve been through. However, the longer I stared, the more eerie it felt, like I was staring at a stranger. I quickly shuffled into the car and took a deep breath. I summed it up to my trauma playing tricks on me, and tried to stay strong. I started the car and switched the radio to the local rock station to calm down. I rolled the windows down and let the breeze comfort me.



I arrived at the station just before 3:00 pm. Constable Mercer was the first to spot me as I stepped inside. He came over and shook my hand, and asked how I was holding up. I gave him the usual half-answer, “Still breathing.” I wandered down the hall, stopping into a few offices to say hello. Some smiled, some looked surprised to see me. Everyone meant well, but I could tell they didn’t quite know what to say. I didn’t blame them.

My last stop was Lt. Rourke’s office. I knocked on the door lightly, just as I did before, and opened the door with respect. When I entered, Rourke shuffled a folder into his filing cabinet. I knew what it was. The Merrin case, freshly updated as a murder investigation instead of a self-inflicted death. “Hey, Brenner! Nice to see you. How ya’ doing?” he said with a smile, but I could tell his mind wasn’t on the conversation; it was still stuck on what I’d been through. “I'm alright, how's the investigation coming along?” I curiously asked. “Hey man, let's not talk about that right now, you don't need to relive that,” he responded. I simply nodded and broke eye contact with him, peering at the floor, staring at his shiny dress shoes. He continued, “I'm sorry, Brenner…” he said quietly. “What for? It's not your fault,” I stated. “I should have closed the case myself… I just wanted it done, so I threw it on you to ease my workload. I’m truly sorry,” he said, his voice getting softer as he spoke. I figured as much anyway. 

We briefly spoke for a moment before I got up to leave. As I gripped the golden handle, Lt. Rourke spoke. “Hey Brenner, one last thing,” he said. “Yeah, what is it?” I responded. “Why did you go to Merrin’s apartment in the first place? What was the loose end you had to tie up?” he asked. I froze. I had lied to him originally about my true intentions. “There… was no loose end… as I read the file, I couldn't help but notice that some of the details weren’t adding up, so… I decided to investigate it myself,” I responded sternly, backing up my prior decision. “Jesus Brenner, please don’t lie to me again. You almost got killed…” he said, disappointment in his voice. 

In that moment, emotion overcame me. ""Well if you hadn’t jumped to conclusions and actually investigated the Merrin case properly, Then maybe I wouldn’t have been nearly fucking killed!” With that, I slammed his door and stormed down the hall. On my way to the front entrance, I spotted my photo on a bulletin board, pinned with a thumb-tack. I glanced at it for a moment before freezing in place. The photo… was like the reflection in the car. I looked so uncanny. My eyes were unnaturally wide, and my expression was soulless. What unsettled me most wasn’t just the expression… It was the fact that this photo was taken over a year ago. And yet I looked exactly like I did this morning, staring back at myself in the car.

I emptied half the magazine before letting my finger off the trigger. I took a breath and began to slowly approach the now-shattered window. Lying just under the window was the mimic, now full of bullet wounds. It began to shuffle away, using its heels to slowly scoot backward. I aimed my rifle at its head. Without hesitation, I pulled the trigger. I watched as its head jerked backwards onto the grass. Its chest stopped rising. 



Sounds began to return. The crickets returned to their normal volume. The sounds of the forest returned. I threw the rifle over my shoulder onto my back and ran for the phone. I dialed Rourke's number and told him everything that had occurred that day. Not long after, multiple squad cars pulled onto my grass, and a dozen cops rushed into the house and backyard. Behind them, a black van. A few men in expensive suits rushed into the backyard along with the officers. I watched from the window as they began to inspect its body. One stated “No pulse”. One of the suited men wheeled a stretcher over and placed its body onto it. They loaded it into the van and sped off, as if they were never here in the first place. I spent the rest of the night at the station with my colleagues. They offered me support at this time. One grabbed me a change of clothes, as my other clothes were scuffed from the fight. Another sat with me, trying to distract me with old, funny stories of me and him together. I appreciated their efforts, but nothing was going to truly help me after what had just occurred.



After an hour or so at the station, one of the men in black suits showed up and requested a private interview back in the van. I reluctantly agreed, and we headed into the parking lot and approached the vehicle. The man knocked in a strange code-like way, and both doors swung open. Sitting in the back were 2 more men in suits, and the stretcher with my.. Its… body lying on it. They brought me inside and began to question me. Stuff like “When was the first time you had seen this man?” and “Did you experience any abnormal experiences prior to the incident at your home tonight?”. I answered their questions honestly, and after some back and forth for about 15 minutes, they concluded their interview. The man closest to the door opened it to let me out. Before I exited, I turned around and peered at the body one more time. There it lay, dead. With a face I see every morning. A face too familiar. I watched the van speed off into the distance, turning onto the road out of sight. I was now alone in the parking lot. I stared at the night sky and its stars for a moment, questioning everything I had ever known and experienced. As I glanced at the moon, I got the feeling again. Like I was being watched.



I quickly whipped around, only to see Lt. Rourke walking toward me. “Hey Brenner, you ok, pal? What just happened? What did they want?” he said. “I think… they were government agents,” I responded, my breath calming. “Jesus Christ. Come on inside with the rest of us. We're gonna stay with you for a while to calm your nerves. Officer Hennessey left to get some coffee and donuts for you and the guys,” he said. I could use a coffee right about now. We headed back inside together. The station was quiet. Maybe the worst was finally behind me. I sat down and sank into the chair, and for the first time in a long time, I felt normal. As if I had won the battle.

---

Before Shift – 8:59 PM

I arrived early again. I don’t know when I stopped doing it just to kill time and started doing it because… it felt wrong not to.

The evening shift always clears out before 10:00. Always. They count their registers down 15 minutes early. If I’m not there by 10:00, they’ll leave the store wide open. Not out of laziness—out of fear.

> “Anyone stupid enough to rob the place after 10 disappears,” Rico once told me.



He said it like a joke. But he didn’t laugh.


---

The manager wasn’t in yet, so I dropped my things in the back and returned to the floor. I brought more candy—this time a soft peppermint ribbon and some handmade toffees. One tasted like pine. I thought Lila might like that.

I also brought an old-style meat pie from a food cart near the train tracks. No name on the cart. Just steam and cloves and flaking crust.

It smelled ancient.

I figured I’d split it. I didn’t know with who yet.


---

During Shift – 10:00 PM to 6:00 AM

10:01 PM – Shift Change.
The chime above the door rings without the door opening.
The Slurpee machine hisses.
The walls breathe out.

> Night shift begins.




---

10:17 PM – She’s Already Here

Miss was leaning on the front counter like she’d always been there. Like gravity held her differently.

She wore a coat I couldn’t identify the texture of—deep gray fur that shimmered without catching light. Beneath it… not much. Thin strips of fabric barely crossing her body in polite acknowledgment of modesty. Skin like milk poured over silver.

She smiled.

> “Something smells old,” she said. “And delicious.”



“I brought a meat pie,” I said, like an idiot.

She purred. “Generous and alive. What a combination.”

I looked away—too long on the legs, too long on the curve of her smile. Too many nights alone.

She didn’t push it. She just took her place near Register Two and started straightening the lottery tickets like it was normal.


---

10:24 PM – Lila Appears

Lila drifted in like she always did—small, quiet, her feet never quite touching the tiles. She was humming something old and simple. Her eyes lit up when she saw the candy.

I offered her the toffee.

She sniffed it. Nodded. “This one keeps them away. Smart.”

“Who’s ‘them’?”

But she didn’t answer. She was already behind the cold case, quietly arranging cups for the coffee machine.

> I had helpers tonight. And for once, it felt okay.




---

11:11 PM – The Past in Pieces

There was a folded paper wedged under the cooler. Looked like a water-damaged receipt at first, but when I unfolded it, the ink shifted like it was still drying.

It read:

> “Totem. Southland Ice Delivery. Cornerstone. It’s always been here. Just under new management.”



I looked at Miss. She nodded without being asked.

> “This place remembers too much,” she said. “You’re lucky it forgets slower than it forgives.”



She touched the receipt. It turned to ash.


---

12:36 AM – Signs of Winter

The Slurpee machine began to hum, low and steady.

But the light on the red nozzle stayed green. Normal.

Still, I watched it.

The outside of the store was darker than usual. I don’t mean the lights—I mean the night itself.

Like someone pulled a heavy sheet over the moon.

I could hear whispers behind the walk-in cooler. Nothing intelligible. But they were reciting something. The cadence reminded me of prayers.


---

1:42 AM – A Human Customer (Probably)

A woman walked in. Short skirt. Fishnets. Glittering eyes. Looked human, mostly.

She smiled at me. Her teeth were too sharp.

> “Do you sell sunmilk here?”



I shook my head.

> “A shame. It’s been years.”



She left without buying anything. Didn’t trigger the door chime on the way out.

I turned to Miss. “Was that one of yours?”

> “She was something’s. But not mine.”




---

3:33 AM – Still No Man

This was the second night without the $6.65 transaction. The man in black at Pump 1 hadn’t appeared. But the drawer still had petty cash, and Lila still had her candy.

> “He’s late,” Lila said. “Or early. Or already been.”



I didn’t ask what that meant.


---

4:01 AM – Cleaning with Spirits

Lila wiped down the counter using her sleeve. She couldn’t hold a rag.

Miss cleaned the front window using a rag I didn’t give her. It looked like lace dipped in shadow.

They didn’t speak to each other, but they moved like they’d done this together before.

> Like I was the new guy in their store.



I started to ask a question—but then I saw it:

A sliver of silver frost creeping from under the frozen burrito case.

Not ice.

Not snow.

> Winter was waking up.




---

After Shift – 6:04 AM

As I was locking the cooler door, the morning light finally filtered through.

Miss leaned against the chip rack, watching it.

> “It’s starting,” she said. “The season of forgetting. The cold doesn’t kill. It preserves. And what it preserves… sometimes wakes up.”



Lila drifted behind her, holding the empty peppermint wrapper.

> “Next shift, bring salt,” she said.



“Why?”

> “To keep your thoughts yours.”



The sun cracked the horizon.

The Slurpee machine powered down with a sigh.

The door chime rang, and the regular world walked in.

1lnjqqx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lnjqqx,Week of 6/29 - What I'm feeding my family of 5 this week for $125,"We are a family of 5 (3 adults & 2 teens). We live in a large urban area in the Midwest. Our grocery budget is around $500 a month, so I average about $125 a week for groceries. We have no major food allergies.

This is the fourth menu plan I’ve shared. You can find the other weeks in my profile.



**Some notes about this week’s menu….**

1. It’s been hot, hot, hot weather in much of the USA. Definitely in the midwest where we are. So this meal plan does not use the oven at all, and you can mostly avoid using the stove top if you have a few small appliances. In fact, the majority of the meals can either be prepared using a grill, pressure cooker, crockpot, and/or rice cooker to minimize heating up your home.
2. There is premade cornbread in this week’s shopping list. Again, to avoid turning on the oven. I normally bake my own cornbread, and if you’d prefer to make it from scratch instead of purchase it here are a couple of bonus recipes for cornbread. One made in a bread machine & one made in the regular oven. Please keep in mind that the ingredients for these recipes are *not* in the shopping list below!

Oven recipe: [https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/cornbread-recipe](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/cornbread-recipe)  
Bread Maker recipe: [https://makethebread.com/bread-machine-cornbread/](https://makethebread.com/bread-machine-cornbread/)

1. If you’d rather have Chicken Fried Rice instead of Vegetable Fried Rice make sure to set aside 2-3 of your grilled drumsticks. Remove the meat from the bone and store in a tightly lidded container to use in the fried rice later in the week.
2. You can choose dried or canned beans for these recipes. Dried beans cost less per serving. Canned beans are more convenient. If you choose to use dried beans just make sure you remember to put them to soak the night before you want to cook them.

For help with converting dried and canned beans when cooking you can refer to this:  
(source: [https://www.beansbeansbeans.com/dried-beans-to-canned-conversion-table](https://www.beansbeansbeans.com/dried-beans-to-canned-conversion-table))

**Dried Beans to Canned Conversion Table**  
All measurements are approximate. The exact amount of beans you receive from a can or a bag of dried beans depends on the size of bean. Large beans will be on the low side of these measurements while small beans will have a slightly higher yield.

* 1 cup dried beans = 2-3 cups cooked beans = 1 ½ 15.5 ounce cans
* One 15.5 ounce can of beans = 1 ½ cups cooked = ¾-to-1 cup dried
* 1 lbs. of dried beans = 2-2 ½ cups dried = 4-5 cups cooked = 3-4 15.5 oz. cans



# Menu Planning Tips:

1. Don’t feel like you have to reinvent the wheel for every meal when making your own menu plan. Start by sitting down and making a list of what meals your family likes to eat.
2. Then reverse menu plan. Look over your fridge/freezer/pantry and see which meals on your list you have the most ingredients on hand for. Plan those as your meals for the week and make your shopping list based off what is missing. Make sure to add any other items you know you are low on, and whatever loss leaders the stores have that week in your area (you can find these by checking the store’s website for their weekly sales flyer).
3. If you look over the few weeks of menus I’ve shared you’ll see that breakfast, lunch, & snacks are pretty much the same from week to week. I do try to prep cook one different “hot” breakfast option each week (usually something egg based like breakfast wraps).
4. The majority of my time and planning goes into our dinners. Which are often lunch the next day as well.
5. For our family, the kids will normally request one or two special items each week. As long as they’re not expensive I’m happy to pick them up. It’s important to fit small treats into the budget as well! The last couple weeks they’ve been on a bagel & cream cheese kick, but they know that once what I bought is gone it’s gone until I go shopping again in a week. Treats are treats because they’re not limitless. ;-)
6. Always keep something quick and easy on hand for dinner in case you just CAN’T cook that evening. Life happens! For our family this is usually a box of pasta and a jar of sauce with some fruits & veggies on the side. I almost always have pasta & sauce in the pantry. It’s also the kids go to on the nights we are out and they have to make dinner for themselves. Pasta and sauce is always cheaper, and usually healthier, than take out!

# Recipes



# Loaded Scrambled Eggs

1 dozen eggs, whisked  
4 Tbsp melted butter  
½ cup half & half  
½ cup shredded cheese  
½ onion, finely chopped  
1 jalapeno, seeded & chopped (optional)  
¼ tsp turmeric (optional)  
2 scallions, chopped  
½ cup chopped kale or spinach  
½ a large tomato, chopped  
¼ tsp garlic powder  
1 tsp salt  
½-1 tsp black pepper

1. Crack eggs into a mixing bowl & whisk well. Add in milk, salt, pepper, & garlic powder. Whisk to combine.
2. Melt your butter in a large skillet. Add your chopped onion & jalapeno into the skillet & sautee over medium for about 5-10 min until they begin to soften.
3. Carefully pour in your egg mixture, lid tightly, and let cook for about 5-10 minutes then stiir to start scrambling your eggs. Replace the lid and cook for an additional 5 min, stir to scramble, and repeat the cooking & stirring steps until your eggs about ¾ of the way cooked.
4. When eggs are about ¾ of the way done add your chopped tomatoes and kale or spinach. Stir well, lid tightly, and cook for a final 10 minutes.
5. Once eggs are done to your liking stir in the shredded cheese & turmeric (optional) as your final step. If you do not have a large skillet these can be made as two batches in a smaller skillet instead or baked in a 9x13 pan in a 350 oven.
6. Serve hot, or store in an air tight container in the fridge to be heated up as breakfast during the week. Serve with toast & fruit, or it also makes an excellent filling for a breakfast burrito if you have tortillas.

# Chili

1 lb ground beef or turkey, browned  
1 lb bag kidney beans, soaked OR 1 - 15 oz can kidney beans, drained  
1 large onion, chopped  
2 stalks celery, chopped  
2 jalapenos, seeded & chopped  
3 cloves garlic, minced  
15 oz can tomato sauce  
15 oz can diced tomatoes  
½-1 15 oz can of water  
¼ cup parsley, finely chopped  
3 Tbsp chili powder  
1 tsp garlic powder  
1 tsp onion powder  
2 Tbsp brown sugar  
2 Tbsp worcester sauce  
1 tsp dijon mustard  
Salt & Pepper, to taste

1) Rinse & pick over your kidney beans. Place them in a large bowl & cover with about 1-2 quarts of water. Soak overnight.

2) Brown ground meat in your pot or using the sear setting on your pressure cooker.  
3) Once the meat is browned, drain off excess fat, and add chopped celery, jalapenos, onion & garlic. Contiue to sautee until vegetables begin to brown.  
4) Add 1 ½ cups of your soaked & drained kidney beans, canned tomatoes & spices. Stir well.  
Fill one of your tomato cans with water (swish water around inside both cans to get the last of the sauce) & add into your chili. If using a pressure cooker set for 40 min on high pressure. If cooking on the stove top bring to a boil stirring well, then reduce the temperature to a simmer, lid tightly, and cook for about an hour, stirring occasionally.  
5) Serve chili hot with corn bread, cheese, and whatever toppings you prefer.



# Chickpea Curry

1 lb dried chickpeas, soaked overnight OR 2 - 15 oz can chickpeas  
1 Tbsp oil  
1 large onion, chopped  
4 cloves garlic, minced  
2 Tbsp mild curry paste  
15 oz can crushed tomatoes  
13.5 oz can full fat coconut milk  
1 tsp sugar (optional)  
½-1 tsp salt, or to taste  
1 cup chopped kale  
4 Tbsp parsley, chopped (garnish)  
1 lime, juiced (garnish)

1) Rinse your dried chickpeas & check them over for bad ones or small pebbles. Place in a large bowl and cover with 2 quarts of water & let soak overnight.

2) Drain your soaked chickpeas. Measure about 2 cups or 30 oz of soaked chickpeas and set aside. Store remaining soaked chickpeas in an air tight container in the fridge or freezer to use in veggie burgers later this week.

3) Prepare curry in a pressure cooker or in a pot on the stove. If using a pressure cooker use the “sear” setting for 10 min to sautee vegetables or sautee in the bottom of your cooking pot.

4) Add oil & chopped onion. Stir regularly until onion begins to become translucent & brown in spots. Add garlic. Sautee another 1-2 min. Add curry paste and stir 1 min. Pour in crushed tomatoes, coconut milk. Add salt, sugar, and chopped kale. Stir well, place on the lid, and pressure cook on high for about 40 min.

5) If preparing on the stove top add all ingredients, bring to a light boil stirring regularly, then reduce to a simmer. Lid tightly and simmer for about 1 hour.

6) While the curry is cooking prepare jasmine rice in a rice cooker according to the directions on your machine OR prepare on the stove top according to the package.

To serve, add hot jasmine rice to one side of a bowl. Add curry to the other side. Sprinkle with lime juice & fresh parsley or cilantro. Serve hot. Store leftovers in an air tight container in the refrigerator.



# Cheeseburger In A Bowl

[https://chefsavvy.com/burger-in-a-bowl/#recipe](https://chefsavvy.com/burger-in-a-bowl/#recipe)

\*\*\* Use 1 lb ground beef or turkey. Turkey is included in the shopping list. I also just use white onion, so plan to purchase 1 red onion if you’d prefer that.



# Air Fryer Sweet Potato Fries

[https://thebigmansworld.com/air-fryer-sweet-potato-fries/#wprm-recipe-container-67247](https://thebigmansworld.com/air-fryer-sweet-potato-fries/#wprm-recipe-container-67247)



# Grilled Veggie Burgers

[https://www.acouplecooks.com/ultimate-grilled-veggie-burger/#tasty-recipes-19718-jump-target](https://www.acouplecooks.com/ultimate-grilled-veggie-burger/#tasty-recipes-19718-jump-target)

\*\*\* We prefer to make these with pistachios instead of walnuts, but choose whatever type of nut you prefer.



# Microwave Potato Salad

4-5 large potatoes, peeled & cubed  
3 eggs, hardboiled & chopped  
1 stalk celery, chopped fine  
½ - 1 cup mayonnaise  
1 Tbsp Dijon mustard  
sprinkle of paprika  
salt & pepper

1) Large, microwave safe bowl

2) Peel & cube your potatoes. Place cubed potatoes into your microwave safe bowl. Fully cover the potatoes with water. Cover loosely with a lid or a damp piece of paper towel. Microwave on high for 12-15 min or until potatoes are tender and easily poked with a fork. Drain cooking water. Allow potatoes to cool to almost room temp, then refrigerate for about an hour until potatoes are cool.

3) While your potatoes are cooling make your hard boiled eggs. I use an electric egg cooker, but to avoid boiling water during how weather you can also make them in the microwave following these directions:  
[https://foodess.com/article/how-to-boil-eggs-in-the-microwave-quick-foolproof-method/](https://foodess.com/article/how-to-boil-eggs-in-the-microwave-quick-foolproof-method/)

4) Once hardboiled, submerge in cold water to cool them down, peel & chop.

5) Take your bowl of chilled potatoes. Add your eggs, celery, mayo, mustard, s&p. Stir well. Taste and adjust seasonings are needed. Smooth the top of your potato salad and sprinkle lightly with paprika. Chill until serving.



# Vegetable Fried Rice

[https://aaronandclaire.com/5-minute-easy-fried-rice/](https://aaronandclaire.com/5-minute-easy-fried-rice/)

\*\*\* Follow directions in the first video for Egg Fried Rice. Scale the number of cups of rice you use for the number of people you are serving. I usually do about 6 cups of cooked rice for 5 people & cook it in a large chicken fryer skillet or wok. Feel free to add in whatever other vegetables you have around. We like to add a couple of finely grated carrots & about ½ cup of frozen peas towards the end of the cooking time.



# Microwave Baked Potatoes

1 baked potato per person  
Toppings: sour cream, butter, s&p, shredded cheese, chopped scallions, etc

1. Scrub your potatoes well & poke each potato several times with a shark knife. This will prevent the potato from exploding in the microwave.
2. Place your potatoes on a microwave safe plate and cook on high power for 5-20 minutes depending on how many potatoes you are “baking”.
3. Potatoes are done when you can easily poke them with a fork. Use oven mitts to carefully remove the hot plate from the microwave. Let cool for a couple minutes & serve with toppings.



# Rice Crispy Treats

5 cups crisp rice cereal  
1 - 10 oz bag marshmallows  
1 stick butter

Large nonstick pot  
Silicone spatula  
9x13 baking pan

1) In a large nonstick pot, over medium heat, melt the stick of butter.  
Measure your cereal out into a mixing bowl so you can quickly pour it into your melted marshmallow mixture when it’s time.

2) Once the butter is fully melted pour in the bag of marshmallows. Stir the marshmallows continuously with a silicone spatula, scraping down the sides of the pot as you stir.

3) Once the marshmallows are fully melted QUICKLY add all your crispy rice cereal. Stir quickly until well mixed and immediately pour into a 9x13 baking dish.

4) If you like softer crispy treats try not to compress your crispy treats as you spread them around the pan. Or, if you prefer harder, crunchier crispy treats do press them down a bit with the back of your spatula.

Let sit until fully cooled then serve. Store in a tightly lidded container.

Today was not a good day, I'm hurting  and I want to know if I f'd up. I got up with the dogs made coffee and decided to let my partner sleep in a little longer as he had to work later but got him up with plenty of time to get ready. I made a lunch for him to pack. Apparently that was a mistake, although he was ""appreciative"" he was upset I moved something of his I never even saw.

He said it was place in the area we have the sandwich bags. He went off on me for over half an hour saying he cant do anything or have anything because i make his life miserable, things like this make him feel like hes going crazy. He knows he left this specific thing in that very spot. This whole thing maked me feel small, unwanted and just overall my mere existence was a skid mark on his life.

I walked away as he wouldn't let me help find whatever I had apparently moved. It seems he found it much later and all I heard was it wasn't there a minute ago. So was it where he thought it was supposed to be or in a completely different spot not sure. Well as he was getting ready to head out the door, he stopped and said he had to go. I looked at him and said ""okay I'll see you later"" making no effort to get up from where I was to kiss him bye. He got upset and said ""wow fine"" to which I responded ""you just yelled at me for half an hour"". He left without a kiss.


So people of reddit aita for not giving my partner a kiss bye after he made me feel completely unwanted, unloved and like i can do nothing right?

I've been looking obsessively at all of the machines out there and I can't make a decision. Help me!

My budget is around $1000ish, although I'd be happy to spend less. I'm looking for a setup that can achieve significantly better coffee than a Nespresso machine (probably not difficult), but I don't think I'm ready for the mad scientist chemistry lab experience where brewing a cup of coffee is a 23-step process that requires 11 different tools and takes an hour and a half. I realize that it's not going to be as easy as just pushing a button, and I'm ok with that. But I'm also ok with sacrificing that last 5-10% of quality in exchange for simplification and ease of use. There may come a time where I want to get more nerdy with it, but I know I'm not there yet.

I've been looking at Breville machines like the Barista Touch Impress (yes, I know it's more than my budget), mostly because it seems like the type of machine that can be very simple and easy to use if you want it to be, or you can get more nerdy with it if you feel like it too. However, I'm concerned about the reviews I've read about the build quality, grinder quality, and lack of support from Breville when things go awry.

I don't *think* I want to go with a super-automatic like a Jura or Gaggia because I *do* want to reserve the opportunity to nerd out and customize things when I have the time to.

I'd probably prefer an all-in-one machine that grinds and tamps and wipes my butt for me automatically, but I'm open to the idea of a separate grinder if it's really going to make a big difference without overcomplicating things and adding a lot of steps and time to the process.

I came out and when I approached the counter, this girl just gave me a big, beautiful smile. Obviously I thought that this was part of her normal customer service routine and thought nothing of it. I ordered some iced coffee with extra cream but had to hang around a little longer than usual because no one was making my order (I've got patience with food service workers since I understand their struggles as I had worked a grocery job before). It then became clear that she was a new hire and that she didn't know how to make the iced coffee and had to ask her supervisor how to make it. 

However, she slightly fucked up my order and put whipping cream instead of coffee cream. I let it slide because I am understanding and just wanted a drink. 

After this though, I kept glancing at her and her interactions with the customers. She had the ""customer service"" smile, but it didn't feel as charismatic or elegant the way she gave me the smile. 

I kept glancing at her because my interest grew, then she glanced back and gave me that same smile. One of her tasks was to quickly water the plants outside. My break was essentially over and decided to head out and as I did, I once again looked at her watering the plants and she looked back at me with the smile again and I thanked her.

Luckily, I went back to the small town again on Friday (June 27) and I went to use the coffeehouse's restroom again. As I opened the door after using it, she was there mopping the floor about 10 feet away. I instantly recognized it was her but decided to look away (I'm not sure why, shyness?). As I approached her she recognized me again and gave me a ""hey"" with that big, beautiful elegant smile. 

God damn it, I'm sure she is just being nice and nothing else. Hell, I am not even fucking attractive. I am a big dude weight-wise (CaseOh type of build but slightly skinnier) and there's no chance in hell someone like her would want me.

She was mopping the floor and began to approach the area to my right to mop. Right then and there I wanted to say something, a small talk, ANYTHING, but didn't. FUCK ME GOD DAMN IT WHY DIDN'T I SAY ANYTHING.

Fortunately, I am headed back to the small town again on Monday (June 30). I am going to say something, but I am overanalyzing this entire thing? Am I delusional? Any advice will surely help.",1,1751216017.0,Crushes,0,0.99,False

Perhaps this photo will explain everything. the spring should be placed on the axle as so and the axle on the seal lever inserted into the hole in the top, and then the smaller axle can be gently guided into the receiving hole. the hard plastic should flex, then pop back into place.

I could not find any diagrams or instruction manuals online. perhaps the company would like to to merely purchase another leakproof lid if you drop your coffee mug.  mine fell off the counter, and the loose lid separated into three pieces -the spring, the ""top"" and the ""seal arm"" when it fell onto the tile. 

 The lid has about seven components which can separate into three pieces that come apart. The ""top"", which is the largest part, has a slider and a ""clicker"" for lack of a better term, the screw top of hard plastic, plus the softer seal. There's a smaller piece underneath the top, with the silicone seal which I will label the ""seal lever"".  and lastly, the spring.  

The lid is spring loaded, in order to be leakproof.  if it hits the hard ground from 4ft, tho, the spring can make the three pieces fly apart. but you can put it back together easily should it come apart.  

Normally, the spring holds the seal arm against the top when the slider is in the closed position. As you slide the slider into the ""open"" position, the slider moves the ""clicker"", which is another lever that holds the seal lever open against the force of the spring, which is tensioned to close seal lever. It opens the lid with a ""click.""  

the spring should be placed on the axle on the seal lever as in the photo. the axle on the seal lever should be inserted into the hole in the top. and then the smaller knub-axle can be gently guided into the opposite receiving hole. the hard plastic should flex, then pop back into place.

I hope this can help. this is easy, but it took me a minute to figure out the configuration of the spring, and the sequence of fitting the axles on the seal lever into the top.

This is a manifesto of my mind, the unapologetic, uncensored rantings of a 23/24-year-old trying to make a point. I'm writing this for you, sure, but especially for me, I'm honest. Consider this your front-row seat into the chaos I call my worldview. We (Gen X Y Z) see the world a bit differently, darker, funnier, and more fucked up and I'm diving right into all of that.

Life is short, life is weird, life is painful, life is beautiful, life is the overpriced carnival ride you never meant to board but now you’re buckled into the front car with sticky cottoncandy fingers and some kid behind you projectile-vomiting existential dread onto your hoodie; life is Monday-morning coffee breath and Friday-night euphoria spliced into the same ten-second TikTok loop; life is your ex texting “u up?” precisely when you thought you’d evolved past that chapter; life is your mom’s casserole that tastes like nostalgia and mild regret baked at 180 °C; life is blowing a month’s rent on a weekend in Ibiza while your student-loan balance breeds like horny rabbits; life is the dog that thinks you’re a demigod and the cat that thinks you’re the help; life is screaming into the cosmic void and getting a targeted Instagram ad for therapy two seconds later; life is binge-watching productivity hacks while doom-scrolling memes about procrastination; life is that one song that still makes the hair on your arms do the wave even after the thousandth replay; life is the universe pranking you with coincidences so perfect you’d swear the simulation just got a software patch; life is midnight truck-stop coffee that tastes like burnt hopes yet somehow keeps the engine of your dreams sputtering; life is losing your mind in rush-hour traffic but finding your soul during a random Tuesday sunrise; life is hoarding memories like cheap souvenirs only to learn the real treasure is the handful of humans you can call at 3 a.m.; life is fucked-up and fantastic and fragile and ferocious all at once, a cosmic joke you’re not sure you’re supposed to laugh at, but you laugh anyway, because what else can you do before the curtain drops and the stage lights cut to black.

Chapter 1: Cancel Culture & Clownery 🤡

Welcome to the 2025 Freak Show, starring Cancel Culture and its troupe of professional clowns. Everyone's offended by everything, and we all pretend to be saints while waiting to pounce on the next poor soul who slips up. It's like the whole world turned into Twitter on steroids. That makes sense though, I don´t see people with balls anymore, they have been shrinking lately. One wrong joke and the cancel clowns want your head on a platter.

First off, mind your own damn business. Why the hell do we care if our neighbor is being walked on a leash by his fiancé? It's weird, I get it, but not our business, let him enjoy it, it is his happiness, not ours. Point is people are way too preoccupied with other people's lives these days. Focus on your own stuff and stop being the morality police for five minutes.

Cancel culture feeds on this nosiness. My friend told me he just wants to not take a stance on every social issue, is that so bad? But apparently if you're not actively waving the flag for every cause, you're a villain. Like, he literally said, ""I don't really care about the whole alphabet, (aka LGBTQ+ thing), I just mind my business,"" and folks called him homophobic for not going to Pride parades. Since when is neutrality a hate crime? Cancel culture logic: silence is violence! No, sometimes silence is just someone eating Doritos and minding their own damn business.

Look, I couldn't give less of a fuck who you love or who you marry. Gay, straight, polyamorous with a lamp, you do you boo!”. I personally think marriage is overrated paperwork anyway. You won't catch me at the chapel, but I’m not stopping anyone else. But here's where I draw the line: keep the degenerate kinky shit out of public spaces, especially where kids are around. I don't care if you're a straight couple dry humping in the park or a gay couple in assless chaps on Main Street, take it indoors. If that makes me a prude, so be it!

Cancel culture loves extremes. And boy, do extremists love cancel culture. There are always extremist idiots who ruin good causes. I support feminism, the real kind the first waves, the ones that were about equality. But I've run into the man-hating ""kill all men"" types who think being born with a Y chromosome is Original Sin. I support LGBTQ rights, love is love and all that. But I've seen some activists say if you're not waving the rainbow flag 24/7, you're basically a Nazi. The reasonable middle gets lost, and the loudest, craziest voices take over. Cancel culture amplifies the psychos and drowns out nuance. True story: I once engaged with a raging feminist on a dating app whose bio read, “Fuck all men who think sending dick pics is okay.” I replied, as politely as one can on a dating app: “I actually agree with your bio, but, with all due respect, don’t you think it’s hypocritical when your profile is nothing but thirst traps?” The woman had nothing but thirst-trap photos, no face pic, while railing against sexualization. HOLY HELL did she go off. I was instantly labeled a “misogynistic rapist” for offering a mild critique. Then she spiced it up with racism, calling me a “short fuck Muslim who loves stoning women.” Newsflash babe: I’m not Muslim; I’m whiter than the milk your father claimed he will go buy the day he left you. Also, I’m not short in either the vertical nor horizontal department . But even if I were, wow, height-shaming, really? I calmly pointed out that my height and religion were irrelevant, which only prompted her to question my intelligence next, even though my IQ is probably higher than she can count. She ran through the classics next: ugly, virgin, lonely, broke, etc. Evidently, by virtue of being male, I was guilty of every sin. That, my friends, is the kind of clownery cancel culture breeds, she was itching to cancel any man in sight. If that’s not a clown show, I don’t know what is. She went from bio-feminist to full-blown courtroom prosecutor in three DMs, I'd said one thing, politely, and suddenly I'm on trial for crimes I didn't commit, That’s the problem: throw ”rapist” at a stranger too easily, and too dilute real suffering with digital theatrics cause you deranged or seek attention.

So, I have a new approach: I clown the clowns. If you're easily pissed off by harmless jokes or basic facts, I'm absolutely gonna take the piss out of you. Call me toxic or problematic, but someone must deflate these oversized egos. People fling words like ""bigot"" and ""Nazi"" so casually now, they've lost all impact. I've been called every name for not toeing some line. At this point, my response is shrug ""Lick my balls, aight?."" (Yea, I said it)

In summary, cancel culture is a circus and I'm happy to play the heckler in the stands. The world is too absurd to take everything so seriously. If you don't like someone’s opinion, maybe just...ignore it? Crazy concept, I know. Instead of cancelling, how about we channel that energy into something productive? Until then, I'll be over here juggling sarcasm and tossing pies at the cancel clowns. Honk honk, motherfuckers.

Cheeky Summary: Cancel culture is just modern-day witch-burning with Wi-Fi. Everyone’s outraged, nobody’s thinking, and nothing of value gets done. My stance: fuck the outrage mob. Offense is taken, not given and I'm done giving a fuck. If that makes me a villain, I'll be the villain with a big grin and both middle fingers up. Cancelled? Sorry bitch, I’m unapologetic.

Chapter 2: Toxic Positivity & Instagram Gurus 😊 Ever scroll through Instagram and feel the sudden urge to vomit rainbows? #GoodVibesOnly . Welcome to the realm of toxic positivity, where everyone's life is amazing all the time and if yours isn’t, well, you must be doing something wrong. It's a land of motivational quotes plastered over sunset photos, pseudo-guru influencers, and MLM boss babes telling you to ""manifest success"" while they slide into your DMs with a pyramid scheme.

Social media is basically a curated gallery of bullshit. There's actual research linking heavy Instagram use to depression (shock) because we’re dumb enough to believe the highlight reels we see. I'm also guilty of that, not gonna lie. Every influencer shows off their perfect life, expensive cars (probably rented), flawless bodies (thank you, Face-Tune), exotic vacations (#LivingMyBestLife!), and relationships that look straight out of a rom-com. Meanwhile, you're sitting there in your PJs at 2 pm, surrounded by snack wrappers and selfdoubt, wondering where it all went wrong.

Even better are the self-appointed “life coaches” and entrepreneurial gurus. You know, the 22-year-old on TikTok who promises to make you a millionaire in six months if you drop $499 on his crypto-trading course. Or the Instagram yogi who swears drinking celery juice cured her depression and if you're still anxious it's your own fault for not meditating enough. They're selling the modern snake oil: toxic positivity. ""Just think happy thoughts! Just hustle harder! The only thing holding you back is you!"" Listen, Karen, my chemical imbalance isn’t going to be cured by your essential oil MLM or a Gary Vee quote.

Toxic positivity is basically this pressure to always be upbeat and grateful. It's BS. Sometimes life sucks and you should be allowed to say it sucks without a smile. But on social media, if you’re not posting gratitude journals and #Blessed hashtags, you’re a negative Nancy. Lost your job? ""Everything happens for a reason, stay positive !"" No, Brenda, maybe I want to stay in bed and be a little pissed off for a week, okay?

And let's not forget the Instagram “wellness” influencers peddling toxic positivity in another form. The ones with perfectly toned bodies (because it's their full-time job to look hot) preaching about 5 am workouts and alkaline diets. Meanwhile, normal people with jobs and responsibilities feel like crap for not having a 12-step morning routine that includes yoga, journaling, and making a vegan matcha latte. It's exhausting.

What these clowns ignore is that real life isn't 100% positive. Hell, it's not even 50% on many days. By denying negativity and pain, toxic positivity just makes people feel guilty on top of feeling bad. Double fuckery. You're sad and you feel guilty for being sad because ""others have it worse"" or ""you just need to choose happiness."" Spoiler: that only makes things worse.

I've personally fallen down the self-improvement rabbit hole. I watched the motivational videos, tried the daily affirmations, listened to the podcasts telling me to hustle 25/8. You know what? It did jack shit for my inner peace. All it did was make me feel defective for not being a zen Instagram monk with a six-pack and passive income. So now I embrace a more balanced mantra: ""It's okay to not be okay."" I'll work on myself, sure, but I'm done pretending every day is sunshine and rainbows.

Social media also blasts us with toxic positivity in the form of envy production. You see others’ highlight reels and assume everyone else is living their best life while you slog through yours. It's fake! We're literally comparing ourselves to carefully edited lies. That influencer with the constant travel pics and no 9-to-5? She’s probably in massive debt or crying herself to sleep from loneliness (or both). The gym bro posting daily shirtless pics is probably taking 100 shots to get one good thirst trap and is just as insecure as the rest of us.

So screw the shiny facade. I'm here to say it's okay to have bad days, it's okay to call out life on its bullshit. If I see another post telling me to ""smile because life is beautiful,"" I might actually throw my phone in the brick wall. Life is sometimes beautiful and sometimes it’s a hot mess. Let’s keep it 100.

Cheeky Summary: Social media's endless highlight reel can go fuck itself. Life isn't a curated feed and positivity isn't a switch you flip on. The next time some influencer tells you to ""just stay positive ,"" remember you have every right to tell them to shove their fake smiles up their ass. Real vibes > good vibes, every damn time. (And if all this fake positivity has you burnt out, just wait until the next chapter, we're diving into the cult of hustle culture. Because if positivity can't kill you, burnout sure as hell can.)",1,1751215845.0,writingfeedback,0,1.0,False

What surprised me most was that all three women specifically thanked me for not exaggerating my height. I list myself as 5'8—possibly closer to 5'9 based on what I’ve been told. The difference is negligible.

Each of them mentioned that on their previous dates, men had inflated their height by 3 to 5 inches. What do you guys hope to accomplish by doing this? It’s not like women won’t notice when you meet in person! Not only does it hurt trust, it also creates suspicion toward guys who are actually truthful about their height. Some women might even assume I’m 5'5.

That said, I’ve also noticed a bit of height and weight fudging from the other side. While it’s generally not as extreme, I’ve met women who said they were 5'8 but were closer to 5'6 or 5'7.

Right from the first time I unboxed it, the pistachio color instantly stood out, offering a splash of charm and elegance to my countertop. As someone who relies heavily on tea and coffee to function throughout the day, having an electric kettle that marries both style and functionality has been a game-changer. With its 1.25-liter capacity and compact design, the KitchenAid KEK1222PT strikes the perfect balance between serving multiple cups and conserving space.

**Stylish Aesthetic and Build Quality**  
The design of this electric kettle is easily one of its strongest points. It’s compact enough that it doesn’t clutter the counter but still has enough capacity to comfortably prepare multiple cups of tea or coffee. The painted stainless steel body has a premium feel, while the aluminum handle feels sturdy and easy to grip, even when the kettle is full. Its pistachio finish adds a retro-modern vibe, making it a decorative piece as well as a functional appliance. Even the removable lid, which I initially thought would be a hassle compared to flip lids, feels satisfying to use and adds to the sleek, minimalistic design.

**Ease of Use and Features**  
Operating the kettle is straightforward. The LED on/off switch is both practical and visually appealing, clearly indicating when the kettle is in use. The 360-degree removable base makes it easy to lift, pour, and set back down regardless of your hand orientation. The two-foot cord length is reasonable, and I appreciate the built-in cord storage in the base to keep things tidy; it’s little details like this that make the product feel well-thought-out. The single-wall construction heats up quite quickly, but it does make the exterior hot to the touch, so I’ve been cautious when handling it immediately after use.

**Performance and Speed**  
When it comes to performance, this kettle doesn’t disappoint. Although it’s not the fastest model I’ve owned, it heats water impressively quickly, usually taking around three minutes to boil a full pot. From making quick morning teas to filling my French press for coffee, it has never let me down. The lime scale filter is a pleasant addition, especially for someone like me who lives in an area with hard water. It helps keep my drinks free from debris and prevents any visible residue inside the kettle.

**Favorable Attributes**  
- Compact size makes it great for kitchens with limited counter space.  
- Retro-inspired design that doubles as kitchen decor.  
- Sturdy aluminum handle and durable stainless steel body.  
- Easy-to-use features such as the LED switch and removable base.  

**Caveats**  
- The single-wall construction can result in a hot exterior, requiring extra caution.  
- Compared to some other models, it lacks advanced features like temperature control.  
- The kettle is not entirely silent while boiling, though it's not overly noisy either.  

**Peer Products**  
A comparison with other options, such as the Cuisinart CPK-17 and Breville BKE820XL, reveals some noticeable differences. These competitors often include features like variable temperature settings and keep-warm functions, which the KitchenAid KEK1222PT doesn’t offer. However, the simplicity and style of this kettle are its main selling points, and for those who don’t need the bells and whistles, it’s arguably a better value. Additionally, the KitchenAid feels more robust in its construction compared to plastic-bodied alternatives, and the pistachio color is unlike anything in the market, lending it a unique appeal.

**Smart Spending**  
For its price point, this electric kettle offers reasonable value. It may lack some advanced technological features like temperature precision controls, but it’s designed for straightforward functionality and consistent performance. If your primary needs are an efficient, attractive kettle that lasts, and you don’t mind the absence of extra settings, this one ticks the boxes. I personally think it’s an excellent choice for everyday tea drinkers or coffee lovers looking for something simple yet reliable.

1lnjali,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lnjali,Sucks to get a defective logo. It looks like a medieval knight! (BOUGHT ORI IN JP) (READ DESC),"During my recent trip to Osaka, I bought a half-zip from a Ralph Lauren store that didn't have the product on display due to it being the last stock of that color and style. I originally went to Japan hoping to find an Estate Rib Quarter Zip, but turns out they don’t sell them in Japan (according to the staff). I even went to the Omotesando flagship (one of the biggest RL stores in Asia), and no luck there either.

Funny enough, when I asked about regular half/quarter zips at the Omotesando store, they showed me a piece (also navy color) that looked exactly like the one I bought in Osaka — same logo stitching, with the polo guy’s head and helmet basically just a circle and square. Interestingly, their store also had only like 2 stocks of NORMAL halfzips/quartzips left too. The colors were Cream and Navy. While the other one in the Osaka store I bought mine in, had 4 left, which were Grey, Black, Cream and Navy. In addition to that, both stores' cream versions had black spots in the exact same place. That started to make me think the same person made both existing Navy and Cream versions in both stores.

Now here’s where the issue comes in: the store I bought it from, a coffee shop and also a RL outlet in Shinsaibashi, had a strict no returns or exchanges policy — even though the receipt stated I could exchange once. Other RL stores in Japan told me that yes, you're allowed one exchange. Apparently, the policy really depends on the store. Just a heads up.

One of the main reasons I went to RL stores in Japan is because there are very few legit RL stores in Asia. For example, in Indonesia, most stores are just branded as ""POLO"" — I did buy a few items there before and while they’re decent quality, it doesn’t feel quite right wearing something that kind of piggybacks off the RL name. Yes I am aware that Ralph Lauren never went into Indonesia due to trademark issues. I'm not saying it's just Indonesia, there are a lot counterfeits too around Philippines, Vietnam, China, etc. 

To be fair, the staff at all the RL stores I visited in Japan were super polite and helpful. The only real challenge was the language barrier at times. I don't blame them for the defect on my product. They weren't the people who made them after all. But for the policy, maybe I do kind of blame them for making it confusing, as to why their receipt says you may exchange once, but their store has a no returns or exchanges policy once bought. It kind of misleads.

I’m just sharing this to express some dissatisfaction with the experience, especially with that store in Shinsaibashi. If you're shopping for AUTHENTHIC RL in Asia, Japan is definitely the place to go — just be sure to double-check the return/exchange policy before you make a purchase.",2,1751215582.0,PoloRalphLauren,1,0.75,False

The biggest benefit for me is a significant decrease in sometimes debilitating anxiety that I’ve suffered from my entire life. I still have challenging moments, but overall I’m able to think more clearly when something stressful happens, and able to calm down much more quickly.

During the last seven months, I’d have a coffee or matcha on average about once a month if I really felt like I needed it (during a migraine, or if I was extra tired and had a long day ahead). This actually felt like a good use of it, no different than taking medicine for a symptom, and it never triggered cravings. 

Then about a month ago, I started craving chocolate badly, so I got a beverage with some cacao in it. Didn’t seem like a big deal, and I started drinking them a couple of times a week, which felt okay. (Though in retrospect, there's a warning sign I should have noticed - if the store was out of the beverage when I wanted it, I would feel anxious and at a loss, like something was missing in my life. I think I was already addicted and needing to fulfill the cravings.) So then a week ago I figured I might as well just buy some cacao powder and make a similar drink at home in order to save some money. That’s where things went downhill. 

I started drinking it everyday, using about 1 tablespoon of cacao. At this point, I was being more mindful of how it was affecting my body, and knew I would quit if the anxiety came back. And holy cow, has it ever. After about a week of consuming cacao everyday, my ability to cope with stress has gone way down, and I’m freaking out way more. I’ve also felt constantly on the verge of a panic attack the last few days. (To be fair, I do have a stressful thing going on, but this anxiety feels out of proportion to it.) This all feels very familiar, and I can’t believe I used to live this way all the time. 

The remaining cacao went in the garbage last night, and I’m going to get some carob powder to make a similar (but caffeine free) beverage. Already this morning I’m craving cacao, which I also haven’t felt in a while. I actually feel the same depression/frustration/slight panic I felt when I first quit caffeine and realized I wasn't going to be able to have my morning coffee anymore. It's a good reminder of what an addictive substance caffeine (and probably theobromine) really is.",6,1751215511.0,decaf,3,1.0,False

The trinkets can be but don't have to be bookish or match the theme of the book. The recipients are all different ages and genders, with different interests (travelling, art, music, reading) so I'm trying to come up with an assortment of goodies that I can pick and choose per person at the time. 

I like doing different crafts too at a very beginner level (diamond art, punch needle embroidery, etc.), so I'm open to giving a completed craft myself or just giving them the kit to do it themselves (depends on the person).

Here's the idea bank I've compiled so far.

- diamond art / book nooks / bookends
- mug / bottle / coasters
- tea / coffee / cocoa
- stickers / magnets / enamel pins / key chain / phone case charms
- candle / soap / lotion / oils
- chocolate / candy / cookie 
- sticky notes / notepad / journal 
- accessories/jewelry (hair clip / bracelet / nail polish) / socks
- bookmarks / pens / markers / highlighters
- book bingo 
- gift cards
- tote bags
- book light / book/e-reader sleeve 
- sun catcher / dream catcher

I was in a relationship during the time with a pretty, any-men-would-date girl. Im not even kidding. I, on the other hand, is just simple, nothing to brag, just existing with the Lord’s exceptional blessing. Ganon. All eyes were on me when i dated my then gf, kasi wala talaga akong maibubuga. 

In short they both were the top kilabots of our college.

Fast forward, patapos na ang college, my then gf started falling for a guy, and twisted the whole story sa friends and classmates namin that I cheated.  My ex and i were toxic na, since i was still holding on while she was pushing me away already. Eventually, we broke up. 

One afternoon, i was sitting in a parking lot, TOTGA happen to pass by and asked me out for a drink. Fast forward, we sat on a table, with her friends, talking about lovelife. They knew for sure my ex and i broke up since mejo known talaga sa college yung relationship namin since sinong mga aakala papatulan ako ng maganda. 

Habang pa tagal na ang inuman, TOTGA is giving me some methapors na about love. Lowkey saying that she likes me. All of her friends went home then dalawa na lang kami naiwan. Then she held my hand and kissed me. Like she waited for that time na mag break kami para magawa yon.
Potek, himlay. AGAIN, sinong mag aakala! Bro, she is so fine.

Sadly, our flirting only lasted 2 weeks. We had a coffee and cinema durig those 2 weeks. Then all gone. She came from a prominent family, never came out as gay. After this, yung bitter kung ex kinamusta ako para sabihing pinag laruan lang daw ako parang dare lang ng grupo. 

We graduated, and moved on.

But the problem is, it still lingers with me. I know na d ko sya about. I know na there will never be an us. Kung iniisip ko, hindi ko naman sya gustong jowain. Pero if there’s someone na randomly iniisip ko sa gabi, sya yun. Not even my ex of 3yrs.

We are still mutuals sa socmed. View each other’s story. But never spoke.

RECENTLY. Lord. I was parking sa isang bank. Nakiusap lang ako sa guard kasi walang parking space office namin. Nasa car lang ako, naglalaptop, then naka window down while waiting mag bukas office namin. Then here comes a mini SUV. Tinted.
I looked at the car tho, kinakabahan kasi ako na baka mahuli ako ng may ari ng building mapagalitan pa si kuya. Tinaas ko ng konti ang window ko baka mapaghalataan na d tenant ang nag park. The mini SUV pulled back and decided to park sa harap ko.

I was busy on my laptop, then suddenly a familiar voice popped. It was my TOTGA. She was saying something sa guard. We were 2-3 meters away but i knew it was her. When i raised my head sya nga. I was just panicking the whole time. Nakayuko lang sa lappy, saying shet shet shet until mawala sya sa paningin ko. Grabe palpitate ko parang 4 shots of espresso.

It has been 9 years since. What could be the solution here? Reaching out will never be an option, swear. Ang torpe ko para don. Pa help naman anong pwedeng gawin para ma erase na sya sa sistema ko.   ",2,1751214999.0,WLW_PH,2,1.0,False

[Kilmainham Gaol](https://www.bing.com/alink/link?url=https://www.kilmainhamgaolmuseum.ie/&source=serp-local&h=YQJqrA7oYWNw6sqfBmSmCRpPOC+pZEYT3IL+yIvE7bw=&p=lw_lstpt&ig=44B860BCD7C14DE68C037F7210137643&ypid=YN8082x1234754502) \- Tickets are tough to get 30 days prior.  However, day of tickets open up at 9:15am on their website.  We were able to easily book, and multiple times were available the day we wanted to go.  

2. Driving - it really wasn't bad.  We rented a car at Dublin airport and drove to Killarney and the Ring of Kerry.  It took a little getting used to but overall wasn't bad.  Roads are narrow, so get the smallest car that will fit the number of people you have.  

3. Ring of Kerry - Follow the guidance [Ring of Kerry Route Ye'll LOVE (+ Google Map With Stops)](https://www.theirishroadtrip.com/ring-of-kerry-drive/) and you will have a great time. We drove counterclockwise and didn't experience any busses on our day.  We lucked out on weather with no rain. Highlights included Rossbeigh Beach, Kerry Cliffs, Coomakista Viewpoint (Sheep!), Portmagee for lunch (Skellig Seafront Cafe), Derrynane Beach and the Ladies view.  This was about an 8-hour day with time at each stop.  Tip:  Make sure to go up to the Coomakista viewpoint.  From Kerry Cliffs, it looks like a dirt road and super steep but isn't that bad.  Take it slow and you will have unbelievable views.  This was a surprise highlight for us. 

4. Killarney Restaurants - Tango Street Food for pizza is a must.  Make a reservation.  It was so good, and one of the top 1-2 meals we had on the trip.  Someone on the forum had raved about this place and it is true.  Staff was great.  Coffee at KP3 had a great staff and just wandered into many bars.    

5. Dublin Restaurants - get reservations to most places. Bambino Pizza for a slice was great.  Don't worry about the line - to the corner is about a 30 min. wait.  Matt the Thresher was good and had fun drinks.  Gallaghers Boxty House in Temple bar was full of tourist but the corned beef was excellent.  The Ivy (I know, many will disagree, and it was expensive, but we had a very good meal there - get the salted caramel Espresso Martini and Shepherd's Pie), Metro Cafe for brunch or lunch.  d

6.  Bars - We enjoyed Temple Bar (yes, very touristy and drinks are more expensive), but really liked other areas as many of you have mentioned:  The Hairy Lemon, Peter's Pub and many more in the Grafton Street, Stephens Green area; Toners and many others on Baggot Street.

1lniyto,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lniyto,Grinder for Moka Pot,"Hi guys, if you are looking for a good cheap grinder “just” for Moka, I definitely recommend the Temu grinder. (Metal one). I did a small comparison of a more expensive one and found no difference for Moka Grind.

I’ve been using a Temu metal grinder that closely resembles the Timemore C2 and decided to purchase the C3 ESP to see if there was a noticeable difference in grind quality and coffee taste.

Build Quality:
The C3 ESP has a more refined and elegant design, but the Temu grinder feels just as sturdy and well-balanced. Both use an identical adjustment system, the only real difference is in the burrs.

Burr Comparison:
The C3 ESP features what appears to be a more modern, precise burr design. While both burrs are the same size and material, the C3’s has a sharper, more intricate finish.

Grinding Experience:
Surprisingly, the Temu grinder offers a smoother grinding experience. The C3 ESP feels slightly awkward in use: it squeaks, takes longer, and often leaves a bean or two unground. In contrast, the Temu grinder operates more fluidly and finishes cleanly.

Grind Quality:
For anything coarser than espresso—like Moka, Aeropress, or French Press, there’s virtually no difference in grind consistency between the two. Both perform well with occasional inconsistencies.
However, when grinding for espresso (under 9 clicks on the Temu, or under 1 full rotation on the C3 ESP), the C3 ESP does produce a more refined grind.

Taste Results:
In terms of flavor, there was no noticeable difference for Moka, Aeropress, or French Press. Espresso, however, did taste slightly better with the C3 ESP.

Conclusion:
I bought the C3 ESP for $65 and the Temu grinder for $23. If you’re focused on espresso, the C3 ESP may be worth the upgrade. But when compared to the C2, C3s, or C2s, it doesn’t offer significant improvements to justify the cost in my opinion.
The Temu grinder performs impressively well, it’s either made by Timemore under a different name or is a very successful clone.

That said, I’m a bit disappointed the C3 ESP squeaks and that its grind consistency above 1 rotation doesn’t outperform the much cheaper Temu.

1lniyd1,https://www.reddit.com/r/MSCCruises/comments/1lniyd1/msc_seashore_review_yc/,MSC Seashore review YC,"Just got off Seashore departing from Miami visiting Nassau and Ocean as a couple. We had a deluxe balcony on starboard side on deck 19 in the yacht club. We had such a good experience with kind staff and wonderful facilities on World Europa last year, we figured we would give a shorter trip a try in the US since it’s an easy flight for us.  This was our first experience with MSC in the US. 

Arrival:
Arrived around 1pm to the terminal. Service was OK. Minimal wait time for YC members.m through security and to get on board. We were escorted in one large group onto the ship and took multiple stops to get people checked into their muster station. Those that couldn’t take stairs had to essentially make it to the elevators on their own. 

Was told to go to floor 16 and that was it. No further escort like we had before onto the ship as YC. We never saw our butler the first day. No welcome fruit was left. Maybe they don’t do that for US cruises.

Food at YC Restaurants:
Ok at best. Risotto was consistently undercooked for us. Proteins were meh. 🫤 We had a much better experience on World Europa in YC. I went to the buffet a few times and had soft serve. They did run out of ice cream cones. Pizza was the best thing consistently. The buffet on the pool deck was ok for lunch. I do miss the sit down menu on the pool deck that was offered on World Europa vs the buffet.  I am very partial to breakfast sandwiches, seashore couldn’t accommodate my request like the staff on Works Europa did. 

We did not do any speciality dining although the hibachi would have been our choice as it’s decent from our previous experience. 

To be fair, I cook at home and am very picky about food quality and what I eat. Even eating at “nice restaurants” is often underwhelming. 

The treats of the pizza and ice cream was great. 😊 

General service at YC-
Plenty of space at the pool and topsail lounge. The extra private area outside on Deck 19 was empty most of the time. Drinks came out fast. They have angry orchard on board for cider drinkers. Not my favorite, but will do!

Unlike my last cruise with World Europa staff at YC we’re ok. No one really bothered to know our names. We were off put by the butler wanting to come in our room to “explain” things at 10pm at night with our do not disturb sign on after advising we were getting ready for bed. To be fair we did not need much from him. The few times I rang I ended up just going to the concierge and it was all fine.


Stateroom: very spacious, we had a huge balcony with loungers and chairs/tables. We had beds up being in a handicap accessible room. Bed was very very firm. If you are a side sleeper you might find issue with the firmness. Mini bar has charges associated with us and no free pressing like in Europe, so definitely be mindful. This was our first time cruising MSC in the US. 
 

Ports:

Only left the ship at Ocean Cay / easy on and off. Golf cart was pretty quick at picking us up, but we had a significant wait getting a cart back. For some reason they skipped us in line and had to wait for another cart. 

YC beach is rocky, but nice and quiet. You will want water shoes! It was crystal clear and some waves to make it fun. The YC Beach probably not the best for kids as it’s Oceanside. Probably what there were not a lot of people there. 

There were only a few people at the YC beach. Plenty of umbrellas to pick from. Plenty of water in aluminum cans which I appreciate. I hate drinking out of plastic.

Food was OK at the YC club at Ocean Cay. The lobster roll was the best thing outside of the pizza. I just wish it was bigger portion, I was still starving. 
The carne asada dish was essentially served rare….which was not what we ordered. The wait was so long my husband just ended up eating it and dealt with the unpleasantness of the texture. 

Wi-Fi -
Remember you get locked in once you connect a device and cannot unpair it on MSC.
It was fine, however in our room on the balcony it kept losing connection outside. 
Remember the browse package won’t allow you to video call, use many apps. I had a texting app I use for work, that would not work for some reason. 
The browse and stream package was fine for some YouTube music streaming. 

Waterslides:

Fun! I’m a big kid adult! They have tubes and body slides available. Just remember to get your bracelet and sign the waiver which was located by the splash pad for the kiddos and the tubes can be found to the left by the bottom of the water slide.

Only cons there seemed to be only two double seaters and two single tubes available. You had to wait at the bottom of the water slide for an available tube. 

The lifeguard at the splash pad / bottom of the slides was not someone I would want around my children. She was downright rude and mean to some of the children. I actually told her she needed to watch her language around the children. They were nothing but calm, polite and respectful. 

Spa-

Got a deep tissue massage and pleasantly surprised it was actually a deep tissue massage. Not one mention of products or being sold/upsold on anything. 40% listed price while docked at Ocean Cay. Not bad considering we had a lot of free time. A++

Thermal Spa:
As a YC we have access included. It was extremely disappointing. The area was filthy.  Unlike a lot of parts of the ship it was freezing! Cups and dirty towels all over. 

The Finnish sauna was broken two days in a row. It was essentially room temperature. I tried to get it going with some water,  but to no avail. 

The snow room looked like a sad dirty park bench in Philly with some gross looking snow. There was some old wet towel that was placed inside. I’m not sure if staff did this or if it was leftover from a passenger.

My experience compared to World Europa was extremely disappointing. It was spotless and clean, good working order on all. Staffed extremely well. 

I would not pay for a thermal spa pass on seascape, however we essentially did paying for YC experience….

It was never once “crowded.” No reservations were needed for us. I think YMMV ship to ship on this. 

Disembarking:

Easy. Our butler did not escort us off, but another YC staff member did. Definitely makes things fast and you can leave at your leisure. We left around 8:40 AM after breakfast and some extra coffee. 

Taxis are really easy to get ~$35-40 to MIA vs rideshare ~$25-35 (yymv). There were five boats in port when we left! Issue with ride share is that rates can be half of that of taxis, but you might be waiting a long time because drivers won’t take the fare or they do and not move and hope you cancel.

I’m trying to identify this coffee table.

It was in my grandparents house for as long as I can remember, so from the early 80s, but I’m sure it was there longer as they built their home in 1952. Additionally one of my clearest memories is that it had a copy of the newspaper from when JFK was assasinated in the drawer.

On the inside, there are two brass pins where a maker plate would have been affixed.

The bottom of the drawer when removed is stamped:

5675

692 58

Insp. 7 (the 7 is in a box)

And there is a large B stamped to the right.

All of that is included in the pictures.

When searching the drawer pull with Google lens, I was able to find one match for a Heritage Furniture Fruitwood Side Table on 1stdibs.

**Date:** July 4, 2025 | **Venue:** Sports Illustrated Stadium | **Time:** 8:30 PM ET

---

### The Setup

Minnesota United FC (3rd in the West, 33 points) and FC Dallas (East, 28 points) are set for a clash that’s less about pride and more about playoff positioning. Minnesota’s “balance between attack and defense” (read: *they don’t suck at anything*) contrasts with Dallas’s reputation as the league’s most overpriced coffee shop—expensive, but you keep coming back.

**Key Stats:**

* **Minnesota**: 33 points, 3rd in the West, 14-8-4 record.
* **Dallas**: 28 points, 7th in the East, 12-7-7 record.
* **Head-to-Head**: Minnesota holds a 4-2-1 edge in their last 7 meetings.

### Odds & Implied Probabilities

Bookmakers are playing the “confident underdog” game here:

|Team|FanDuel Odds|Bovada Odds|DraftKings Odds|Avg. Implied Prob.|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Minnesota**|\+255 (2.55)|\+260 (2.6)|\+250 (2.5)|**39.2%**|
|**Dallas**|\+270 (2.7)|\+270 (2.7)|\+260 (2.6)|**37.7%**|
|**Draw**|\+333 (3.4)|\+333 (3.45)|\+300 (3.25)|**29.4%**|

**Underdog Win Rate in Soccer:** 41% (per your data).

---

### The Math (Because You Insisted)

Let’s calculate **Expected Value (EV)** for Dallas, the underdog:

1. **Bookmaker Implied Probability for Dallas**: 37.7%.
2. **Historical Underdog Win Rate**: 41%.
3. **Split the Difference**: (37.7% + 41%) / 2 = **39.35%**.

**EV for Dallas**:  
(41% \* 1.7) - (59% \* 1) = **+10.7%**.  
*Translation: Bookmakers are undervaluing Dallas. Take it.*

---

### Injuries & Key Player Updates

* **Minnesota**: No major injuries reported. Their “balance” includes a functional midfield led by **Lucas Zelarayán**, who’s as reliable as a GPS in a desert.
* **Dallas**: **Ferran Torres** is out with a “mysterious hamstring issue” (read: *he’s probably fine*). Their attack relies on **Dax McCarty**, who’s older than the MLS itself but still kicks like a caffeinated kangaroo.

---

### Why Dallas?

1. **Bookmakers Are Dumb**: They’re pricing Dallas at 37.7%, but history says 41% is more accurate. That’s a **3.3% edge** for the underdog.
2. **Dallas’s Defense**: They’ve allowed just 1.3 goals per game over their last 5 matches. Minnesota’s attack? It’s like a toddler with a water gun—*enthusiastic, but ineffective*.
3. **Playoff Pressure**: Dallas can’t afford to tank. Minnesota, meanwhile, might rest key players and pretend they’re “evaluating options.”

---

### Final Verdict

**Best Bet:** **FC Dallas to Win (+270)**  
**Play Type:** Moneyline  
**Why?** The math checks out, the bookmakers are sleepy, and Dallas’s underdog charm is *literally* paying dividends.

**Expected Value:** \+10.7% (Dallas).  
**Alternative Play:** Over 2.75 Goals (-105) if you’re feeling spicy.

---

**Final Score Prediction:** Dallas 1, Minnesota 0.  
*Because nothing says “playoff contender” like a last-minute winner from a 34-year-old striker who smells like regret and Gatorade.*

*Note: If Dallas loses, at least you’ll have a story about how you bet on the team with the kangaroo.* 🦘⚽

1lniq4t,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoweredByExperience/comments/1lniq4t/explore_best_single_serve_coffee_maker_kidisle/,Explore Best Single Serve Coffee Maker KIDISLE CM9429D Is It Worth It,"Compact and practical appliances always catch my attention, especially when they promise multifunctionality. I decided to try out the KIDISLE CM9429D - UL coffee maker, particularly drawn to its 3-in-1 brewing functionality and travel mug inclusion. My kitchen counter isn’t exactly spacious, so a compact, versatile coffee machine instantly seemed appealing. Over weeks of daily brewing, I’ve tested its features, noting both the good and not-so-good points. Here’s how this sleek little machine held up.

**Compact Design with Travel Convenience**  
Having a coffee maker that takes up almost no space is a dream, and this compact appliance delivers on that front. At less than 5.1 inches wide, it barely nudges into my countertop setup. I’ve managed to slot it beside my blender with room to spare. It also vacuums out the ""too bulky for small kitchens"" problem that most coffee machines come with, making it an ideal fit for my apartment. The inclusion of a stainless steel travel mug was the cherry on top. As someone who’s always on the go in the mornings, this machine accommodates mugs up to 7.2 inches tall, meaning no overflow drama for busy days. The convenience is honestly well thought out.  

**Flexible Brewing with a 3-in-1 Function**  
This pod coffee maker offers brewing flexibility I wasn’t expecting. With two adaptors included alongside a reusable capsule, it handles K-cup pods of any standard brand without issues. However, my love for fresh ground coffee was another reason this machine intrigued me—and it didn’t disappoint. It lets you switch between K-cups, ground coffee, and even tea. There's something to be said about this versatility, especially if you share your machine with tea drinkers or someone who prefers freshly ground coffee over pods.  

**[Check KIDISLE CM9429D - UL price on Amazon.](https://techieupdate.com/p/b0dhclg55h/)**  

**Self-Cleaning for The Win**  
Remembering to descale and clean coffee makers can often fall to the bottom of everyone’s to-do list, but the self-cleaning function built into this machine practically eliminates that excuse. A quick press-and-hold of the “Size” and “Brew” buttons activates the automatic cleaning feature. While I try to clean my machines thoroughly, this easy functionality meant I didn’t experience the nasty aftermath of a clogged coffee maker after weeks of use. For someone forgetful like me, this self-cleaning function was nothing short of a mini-miracle.  

**Adjustable Cup Sizes for Different Moods**  
There’s something satisfying about having options, even in coffee brewing. This machine brews five different sizes: 6, 8, 10, 12, or 14 ounces. Some mornings, I need a tiny caffeine shot. Other times, I crave an oversized cup for long reading sessions. I appreciated the control over my beverage size and the consistency it offered with each brewing. It’s a level of thoughtfulness I’ve rarely seen in more expensive machines.

**Positives**  
- Compact size fits even the tightest spaces without feeling cramped.  
- Offers cup sizes from a quick shot to a larger morning brew.  
- Welcome travel mug accommodation suits busy morning commuters.  
- Excellent versatility handling K-cups, ground coffee, and teas.  

**Negatives**  
- Filling small water reservoirs gets repetitive with larger cups.  
- It feels slightly lightweight—an unfortunate tradeoff for portability.  

**Product Competitors**  
Comparing this model to similar products, the KIDISLE coffee maker stands out in terms of multi-functionality and a surprisingly compact design. Competing brands like Keurig’s single-serve models, while slightly faster, almost always fall short on versatility—brewing tea or ground coffee isn’t always an option with their machines. Other compact brewers I’ve tested either lack self-cleaning or struggle with accommodating reusable capsules, putting the KIDISLE unit ahead when it comes to user convenience. One slight disadvantage: models like the Keurig K-Mini feel a bit sturdier in build, while the KIDISLE comes across as more lightweight due to its plastic components.

**Financial Value**  
For a machine priced in the mid-range of similar single-serve brewers, it strikes a good balance between features and cost. While some competitors might seem fancier, they often pack half the functionality. The 3-in-1 brewing system alone makes this machine a financial winner, especially for households that juggle between different styles of coffee—or tea. Compared to devices that either do K-cups or ground coffee, this one ensures you’re not locked into one route. That level of flexibility adds undeniable value to an affordable package.

Just wanted to bitch.,"As the title says, this is my first post here, and I just wanted to bitch for a second. I literally typed in “in-laws” in the Reddit search bar and found this Sub, so anyways. In no particular order, here’s a few thing that absolutely drive me insane about my MIL that I’ve noticed over the years

   • It takes her FOREVER to drink a cup of coffee. I mean it’s insane. The cup will sit until it’s cold, then she microwaves it, then it gets cold. She does this with the same cup multiple times, everyday. It drives me NUTS.

   • She’s been screwing a married man for over a decade, and still doesn’t understand she’s the side piece. This one should be pretty self explanatory, just insane.

   • She claims she hates technology, but stays on her phone constantly, and uses it to try and be right about everything.

Anyways, if you read this, thanks for letting me bitch!

1lnipsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/carpaltunnel/comments/1lnipsd/diagnosed_surgery_scheduled_but_pain_is_nearly/,"Diagnosed, surgery scheduled, but pain is nearly gone?","Hi all - this subreddit has been so helpful to me and I wanted to share my experience and ask a question.

Background: diagnosed with moderate carpal tunnel on my right hand, confirmed by EMG, scheduled for a mini-open in August. Symptoms started earlier this year with numbness in the thumb and three fingers and severe pain at night. RX for braces, but after 6 weeks of wearing them, no relief at all. Moved forward with scheduling surgery.

Pain was getting so bad at night that I would wake up every hour with terrible pain and numbness that I could only shake by getting out of bed. Hard to type or hold a pen during the day. I tried to get surgery moved up but August was earliest they could do. At my wits end, went to my chiro office for deep tissue medical massage. Not the relaxing kind of massage but the kind where they just dig deep for 50 minutes on the neck, shoulder, and arm, and it hurts so bad/good. After 4-5 sessions, I’m nearly pain free and no more numbness at night. Still bracing, sleeping with my hand elevated, and teaching myself to sleep on my back. I still have zaps with some types of movement like reaching behind to hook a sports bra or lifting a very full large coffee mug and I have slight numbness in the tips of my fingers and thumb but it is so much more manageable than before.  

I’m going to talk to the surgeon at my pre-op appointment, but it’s hard to imagine letting someone cut into my hand and a recovery that will be more painful than my current level of pain which is now, surprisingly, minimal. 

Has anyone ever experienced this or delayed a planned CT surgery because the flare of acute pain died down? 

The massage therapist’s plan is to start reducing frequency of massages and getting to a place where I’m just seen monthly which would be manageable and worth it for me. 

I’m just curious to hear about other’s experiences around this decision.

Thanks so much!

She got into some coffee beans last night around 5 pm or so.  Didn’t seem like she ate too many and she’s not a small dog so we decided to just take a wait and see approach.  She was pretty restless most the night which we expected.  Had her moments of being able to calm down and lay still for awhile.  This morning around 8am she threw up the beans.  Mostly while.  Around 15 or so of them.  She’s still able to lay still and not be pacing around.  Just panting a lot now.  

She had a case of bloat about 6 months ago that we did take her to the pet er for and we’re still paying that $2500 bill off.  And I read these symptoms can last anywhere from 12-36 hours, and we’re only at hour 15ish.  Wondering if anyone else has had experience with this?  At what point should we take her in?

I know July-Aug is heavy rainfall season. Despite that, if you have any recommendations, it will be super helpful! I don’t have a specific itinerary planned, want to go with the flow. 

I’m landing in Hanoi and more or less free to go anywhere. Open to suggestions!

I eat everything (no meat or allergy restrictions). and I love trying all sorts of food.

I’m traveling solo. living in hostels. low to mid budget. nothing too fancy. you wouldn’t find me in mariotts & hyatts.

I like to travel as local as possible and get to deeply understand culture + food + traditions etc. love coffee. and the country is famous for coffee, so I’d love to find great cafes.

I like running. would be nice to find some good running routes or hikes.

I like history & stories of all kinds. not just museums, even going to random / obscure / abandoned places.

I’m not sure if couchsurfing is a thing in Vietnam but would be lovely to stay with a local family for a day or two.

Recently started enjoying techno gigs. so if you know of any good parties, clubs etc, that’ll be great too!
