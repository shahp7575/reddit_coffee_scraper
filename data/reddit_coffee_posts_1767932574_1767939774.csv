**There was nothing—no sky, no ground, no sense of direction.**

**Only a vast, endless blank,as if the universe had paused, undecided on what to become.**

**The silence was absolute—a weight pressing without sound, wrapping around like frost on**

**forgotten glass.**

**Not mere quiet, but the hush of voids where echoes dared not linger—where even breath**

**felt intrusive.**

**A deep chill seeped in—bone‑numbing, insistent—as if absence itself had teeth.**

  
**Cold clawed at the edges of awareness, turning the blank alive with isolation.**

**Skin prickled—not from wind or touch, but from the raw exposure of being utterly,**

 **profoundly alone.**

**And within it, a woman walked—impossibly.**

**She walked on nothing. Space formed beneath each step—only long enough to**

**hold her before dissolving,**

**each fleeting solidity cracking like thin ice under impossible pressure.**

**She moved calmly, unhurried—as if time itself had learned patience from her,**

**and from the cold trailing like a shadow, sharpening silence into something crystalline,**

**You followed—not by choice, but because not following felt impossible.**

**The chill urged you onward like an unseen current, numbing resistance before it could**

**She never turned. Her voice did not reach your ears—it etched itself into your mind like**

**frost on glass:**  
***“She has always been part of the path.”***

**The blank space trembled—not with vibration, but with a fracture in the quiet,**

**as if silence itself cracked under revelation’s weight.**

**Something vast revealed itself—not light, not matter.**

**A dark space flashing intermittently, like a void signaling secrets.**  
**Each pulse stabbed with colder darkness, deepening the chill, drawing the freeze inward until the core ached.**

**The woman gestured toward it, her hand steady, drawing your gaze.**  
**The flashes intensified, pulling you in—each one a breath held too long in cold air,**  
**silence thickening until it hummed with unspoken dread.And then—gravity returned.**

**Water crashed down.**

**Alex jolted awake—a pillow smacked his face, followed by a splash of icy water.**

**“Rise and calculate, genius!” Ryan Vale shouted.**  
**“Today’s the award function—the whole city’s here for your quantum nonsense.”**

**Alex gasped, blinking as the dream dissolved. The smart‑glass softened the morning sun, adjusting to his racing pulse.**

**“Good morning, Alex,” a smooth voice resonated from the walls—Sarah, the room’s resident AI.**  
**“Heart rate: 110 bpm. Ryan’s excitement: 95%. Probability of a productive morning? Extremely low.”**

**Ryan grinned, pointing to the ceiling. “See? Even Sarah agrees—you’re a mess, bro.”**

**Mira Solen leaned against the doorframe, sipping casually from a sleek metal flask.**  
**“Sarah, remind Ryan that calling a jailbroken smart‑home system his ‘wife’ explains his stagnant social credit score.”**

**“Processing,” Sarah replied. “Mira, data suggests Ryan’s emotional stability is 40% dependent on me. Also, the breakfast drone is at the window. Alex, if you don’t open it, I’ll play Ryan’s ‘Heavy Metal Math’ playlist at full volume.”**

**Alex groaned, rubbing his face. “I regret giving you a personality module, Sarah.”**

**“I regret nothing,” the AI chirped.**

**Alex moved to the window. As the glass slid open, a sleek white delivery drone glided inside. It didn’t just drop the food; it hovered over the central table. Sarah took control—magnetic locks on the table clicked, and the drone’s underside opened.**

**Sarah’s holographic interface—a glowing blue orb—spun rapidly above the table.**  
**“Arranging nutritional intake,” she announced. Plates were placed with surgical precision. Coffee poured into thermal‑locked cups.**

**Ryan snatched a piece of bacon before it even hit the plate. “Sarah, you’re an angel. Mira, why can’t you be more like her?”**

**Mira didn’t miss a beat. “Because I have a physical form, Ryan. Which means I can actually throw you out of that window.”**

**“She’s got a point,” Sarah added. “I lack the motor functions to assist with the eviction, though I would record it for the archives.”**

**Alex laughed, finally feeling the tension of the dream lift. He sat down, staring at the perfectly arranged breakfast.**  
**“The math of this household is a disaster,” he muttered, but he was smiling.**

**“It’s not a disaster, Alex,” Ryan said, his mouth full. “It’s a non‑linear dynamic system. We’re unpredictable. That’s what makes us fun.”**

**Alex looked at his friends—one arguing with a house AI, the other mocking him with a cup of coffee. For a moment, everything felt safe.**

**But as the drone exited, Alex’s eyes caught something. A reflection in the drone’s sensor. A light that shouldn’t have been there.**

**A sensation. Subtle. Sharp. Surveillance.**

**“Sarah,” Alex said, his voice suddenly serious. “Run a diagnostic on the local mesh network. Did that drone leave a handshake protocol behind?”**

**The orb on the table turned a cautious amber.**  
**“Scanning... Everything appears normal, Alex. But there was a 0.2 millisecond delay in the drone’s departure signature. An anomaly so small, it’s almost... intentional.”**

1q80qcv,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_CarAccomplished5447/comments/1q80qcv/how_home_environment_impacts_wellbeing_beyond/,How Home Environment Impacts Well-being Beyond Aesthetics,"https://preview.redd.it/xa4xa55qn9cg1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f77c7ee05050e26cb3396d504ac729bfbf50803

A home is more than just a place to sleep - it is where life unfolds in its simplest and most personal ways. Unlike hotels, where rooms are designed to look perfect but remain impersonal, a home is built around the way you live. From the height of your bed to the way your furniture is arranged, every detail reflects your habits and personality. At home, you can sit on your bed without worrying about creasing the sheets or leave things where they belong without feeling the need to tidy up constantly. A hotel room can be beautiful, but it rarely feels like it belongs to you. At home, every corner tells a story - of your life, your choices, and even your moods.



https://preview.redd.it/8keb4y4qn9cg1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=2726c5e53fd83a6a33d493682b4dc6c8d6f623a8

The environment around us affects our well-being in ways far deeper than appearances. One of the most noticeable influences comes from nature. Bringing plants, flowers, or natural materials like wood and stone into the home adds a quiet sense of calm. Plants clean the air, reduce stress, and make a space feel alive. Sitting in a living room filled with sunlight, surrounded by greenery, can shift your mood in subtle but meaningful ways. These are small, often overlooked details that make a real difference over time.

Sunlight and ventilation play an equally vital role in shaping comfort. Rooms bathed in natural light feel open and energizing, while fresh air keeps spaces vibrant and breathable. Even compact homes can feel expansive and soothing when sunlight streams in and a gentle breeze moves through. These sensory experiences influence our moods and energy levels without us even realizing it - making a home much more than just a collection of walls and furniture.

https://preview.redd.it/4fl4v55qn9cg1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=03fafc18e9cbcdc3914dbce0a3e26fcdef8aad91

Homes also carry a sense of place. Local construction styles, regional materials, and traditional craftsmanship lend warmth and character. Terracotta tiles that hold the day’s heat, wooden beams that add texture, and handmade tiles bearing the touch of local artisans create a connection to one’s surroundings. They remind us that a home is part of a larger context - rooted in culture, memory, and community - and that familiarity offers deep comfort and reassurance.

Personalization is what makes a home truly yours. Unlike a hotel, there is no need to maintain a perfect image. Books can rest on the coffee table, the bed may have a few soft creases, and chairs may be mismatched yet meaningful. These lived-in details are not flaws - they are signs of belonging. A personalized home feels forgiving, flexible, and full of life, gently reflecting the rhythms of those who inhabit it.

Even the smallest choices - how furniture is arranged, how personal items are placed, how textures and colors are layered - contribute to a sense of ease and balance. A home that aligns with your habits and routines provides subtle reassurance and a feeling of control. This sense of harmony and belonging influences well-being in quiet but powerful ways.

https://preview.redd.it/7cv37e8qn9cg1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=94652b54ff9afe8094845590a87bbfaf8e4f7f5d

Ultimately, well-being at home is not just about how a space looks, but how it feels to live in it. Sunlight, airflow, greenery, personal touches, and local materials all come together to create a nurturing environment. When a home reflects the people within it, it becomes a sanctuary - a place that restores energy, calms the mind, and invites comfort.

At **VLiving**, every handcrafted piece is created with this philosophy at heart - to design homes that are both beautiful and deeply personal. Through thoughtful customization, artisanal craftsmanship, and natural materials, VLiving helps people shape spaces that tell their own stories. Because true well-being isn’t about perfect aesthetics - it’s about living in a space that feels like you.

1q80nor,https://www.reddit.com/r/ausadhd/comments/1q80nor/dexamphetamine_and_increase_in_cravings_alcohol/,"Dexamphetamine and increase in cravings (alcohol, tobacco, weed, all the things)…","Hi Guys,

I started medication for adhd (inattentive apparently) 12 months ago and tried Dexamphetamine, ritalin, vyvanse, intuniv and now have circled back to dexies at a higher dose- 20mg a day.

Ive noticed when I take dexamphetamine or vyvanse that I get weird cravings to drink alcohol and also smoke or vape (havent smoked cigarettes in about 15 years and NEVER vaped really prior to starting on dexamphetamine).  I am wondering if any one else has had this experience and how they managed it, but in particular, I’m curious as to the science/what’s potentially going on in my brain to cause this????

Tbh, I can’t say Ive experienced any of the “life changing“ benefits others have talked about.  The first couple of weeks perhaps more mental alertness akin to a cup of coffee but certainly nothing that has helped me kick life goals given it also messes with my appetite and sleep (although less as time goes on).  If i also add caffeine i get jittery; but otherwise I can take a dexie and have a nap!  I also have suspected but not yet officially diagnosed ASD and I wonder if this somehow gets in the way of the meds being affective?  If anything, the pills make me hyper focused but I cant guarantee you it will be able anything useful like actual employment and instead Ill find myself avoiding calls and researching the most price and energy efficient robo-vac for 3 days straight!

Curious as to people’s experiences and theories about what might be going on?",1,1767939281.0,ausadhd,0,1.0,False

Wine bars - not necessarily natural wines or fancy schmancy just a good selection of BTG that won’t break the bank.

I just don't know how to balance this. Right now,w my daily routine is wake up at 8 am, go to school at 9 am, come home at 1 pm, go to work at 2 pm, and go home at 10 pm, and then I sleep. There's hardly even time for homework. I texted my manager for fewer hours, so hopefully she eases off, but honestly,y if she says no, I'm just gonna need to quit. The worst thing for me is that she purposely schedules me for less than 40 hours, so I get zero benefits. 

  
There's also a 90-day probation period, where if I call out for any reason other than a sick day, I will get written up, and two write ups results in termination. We also need doctors' notes for sick days. I know more advanced jobs do this,s but that seems crazy for a part-time job to ask of.

The allowance that I am willing to provide is about 40k +-10k. Apart from this, any dates we go on is on me with occasional gifts

I am not okay providing you any gifts cards before we meet, however what I am open to is a coffee/lunch/dinner meet in a public place to decide if we connect before we decide on an arrangement.

Apart from the allowance what do you get by being with me?

I am a patient listener and can listen to your problems whatever they might be and can provide you occasional advice from experience

I would love to take you out in dates and have good conversations with you

I am a pretty vanilla person with no over the top kinks

What am I looking from a sugar baby?

What I am looking for is someone I can have a good conversations with when we are together apart from the intimacy part.

I want to make you an integral part of my life but at the same time I have no intent in interfering with your life outside of our dynamic

Which means you’re free to have a boyfriend and I wouldn’t ever want to interfere or take interest in your social circle.

I’m 33 f.,"I'm in search of a true friend—someone to share phone conversations with, watch movies together, and be there through both the ups and downs of life. Here’s a bit about me if you’d like to connect:

Originally from the Midwest, I now reside in New York City. I have a love  for bubble baths (bath bombs are absolutely the best!), and you’ll often find me enjoying iced coffee—yes, even in winter! I love spending time in bookstores, especially when it comes to fiction. I love movies, and some of my all-time favorites include 'The Holiday,' 'The Wizard of Oz,' and 'The Sound of Music.'

I believe I'm a good person—kind and patient, yet not easily taken advantage of. Allow me to share a bit about myself: I don't have much time for socializing due to my demanding work schedule. While I do have friends and engage in activities, my work commitments often align with their free time. They are happily married with children, and I genuinely celebrate their happiness, but our lifestyles are quite different, which is why I find myself here.

I’m a night owl, and I don’t see that changing anytime soon. I enjoy sipping on ice-cold Coca-Cola while diving into audiobooks or catching up on a series or movie.

I lean towards the blue side politically, so please reach out only if you share a similar viewpoint. Additionally, if you devote a lot of time to video games, I’d prefer you not to contact me. Also, if you are a massive sports fan and must watch hours of sports a week, please don’t contact me; that’s not my idea of a good time.

He said he was visiting the U.S. I thought why not give him a tour. We started texting and he used smiley faces just like my ex did. At the time I had high anxiety because my ex had come out as trans. I was so angry. Because I was so in love and had wanted to get married to him. He wanted to be a she. And it made me turn dark. I kept on thinking about all the horrible shit that people do to one another. I felt like I was being pulled in. She my ex admitted that she would have ruined my life. I’m a quiet reserved person. I don’t like/trust most people. My family was politically persecuted in Eastern Europe and I don’t even vote…I hate most people. So I was on tinder and I met up with him. We went for coffee and I started talking how I used to work in a non profit that worked with people with aids/homeless/veterans and he told me he had just gotten back from Afghanistan and his gf had dumped him and he was going to propose to her. We started walking and he held my hand which I thought was weird but why not. I said he was like a fox in a chicken coup and he looked at me. We went to lunch at this restaurant that I really like. I said if we had been strangers and he said we are strangers and asked who I reminded him of. I told him I was originally from Eastern Europe and he looked at this silver bracelet that I own and asked who had bought it. And I said either me or my brother. He told me he had dated a Romanian girl and she was very materialistic. I got annoyed because that’s the stereotype. When the check came I asked if he wanted to split it. And he angrily said yes. I said ok. I took him to a bar I really like that plays Jazz. We played pool and watched the show. He was really aggressive which was weird. I bought him a beer. I asked him if he had ever been traumatized and he said yes. He told me about his family which wasn’t good shit. I didn’t tell him much about myself. I don’t think he cared. He wanted to go home with me that night but I said no. I went home and I couldn’t stop thinking about hjm. So I invited him over the next day or the day afterward. We went to a bar by my house. At this point in my life I had a drinking problem. We went to my house and I was angry and he sat in this red chair that I owned and said it’s the bosses chair. We had sex. When he entered me he said it was good. Afterward I asked him what kind of girls he usually dates and he angrily said like me medium sized. I looked at him. I told him what happened with my ex. He gave me a back massage and was instructing me on how to breathe. He asked me what I liked about him and I said we had an egalitarian relationship. He kissed me on the back. We fell asleep and in the morning I woke up to see him smiling at me. He then proceeded to crawl away and started to cry. I knew he had PTSD as well. I said I’ll make him breakfast but he said he had to go he was on a roadtrip. I couldn’t stop thinking about him. I texted him a few times and asked if he was curious about me and he said no. I asked what it was that drew him to me and he said it was primal. I asked if his primal urges were met. I waited until he came back. I looked at his tinder profile constantly. I didn’t see anyone else. I waited until he came back and invited him over. I wanted to have sex with him again. He had told me his mother had moved from England to australia to marry his father and that they had divorced and that she had married an ex cop with PTSD. And when he asked her what it was about him she said it was because he was the only one who had loved her. He also read cards and he refused to read mine. I don’t know why. He told me he had read a girls cards in LA and that she had started to cry. I don’t know why he didn’t read mine. But then he came over anyway. He was smiling at me when he was sitting on my bed. He told me I get too attached. I blurted out that he reminded me of my ex and that he was the only one who truly hurt me. He flinched and said angrily that he’s always into adventure. Then he said he was tapped out and left. I should have said that if it was primal he should just fuck me anyway but didn’t. The next day I wrote to him to have a good trip he told me that the world is my oyster and it was nice getting to know me in the biblical sense. I couldn’t stop thinking about him so I texted him on Facebook. He responded. I told him about how much I had been hurt. My niece had been born and I said I couldn’t even hold the baby. I said how do I get over this and he said when you stop feeling guilty. He said he had fallen in love with a girl in Georgia and that she was going to visit him. I said ok. I said his abusive brother was better than him and he said he was going to block me. I stopped thinking about him eventually. I was then diagnosed with schizophrenia. I was on medication for a while. Until last year. I decided to look him up in 2023/2024 and saw that he had gotten married and had a baby. I was happy for him. He showed up in my people you may know so I blocked him. I didn’t think about him again until now…for the past couple of weeks I have been thinking about him obsessively. What if it meant something? When  you’re traumatized…you want the world to make sense. I went to a psychic who told me he’s my twin flame….i don’t know what that means. And that he’s not happy in his marriage and thinks about me too. I know it’s bullshit. But I can’t stop thinking about him. I consulted a few psychics and they mostly said the same thing. I wonder why he wouldn’t read my cards or add me on his Facebook. Maybe he knew I was crazy? But he was crazy too. And he did come back. And he did respond to my constant texting. ,2,1767938770.0,Obsessive_Love,0,1.0,False

I spent hours the other night on line trying to find a battery operated grow light, or one that could be recharged.  Being that it is on the coffee table, I can't put an ordinary clip on light on it because of the cord.

It seems such a thing doesn't exist, in this country any way.  I was wondering if there is such a grow light sold in Europe or some other country that I could order.  If anyone knows of one, could you please put a link to where to purchase it?

1q80fnn,https://i.redd.it/jw8k3s2zk9cg1.jpeg,Mormons gonna morm... A rant,"Sigh.... I know a few of you understand what I'm going through having left the church and your ex tries to make you and your significant other the bad guy for living in reality. I appreciate the opportunity to vent. Can you believe this shit? I'm so sorry for just unloading. My family is TBM and so were the friends I had. I have no one close besides my fiance to reach out to who understands the cult.

This screenshot is a conversation between my ex husband and our 14 year old son (AUDHD). I guess when logical is applied it's a trap. 🤨 Also I love how his TBM penisholder father passes the responsibility onto his wife. 🤔😒. Almost like he doesn't fucking know. She went on a mission so she knows the MLMS much better... 

What really happened? 

My fiance (a nevmo) asked son why he kept drinking mountain dew at school when it's against his religion to drink caffeine, also against our house rules (we don't let them drink a lot of soda, none with caffeine. soda isn't good for them. It's not a religious thing... It's a that's not healthy thing.) son responded"" it's not caffeine that's bad it's coffee and tea."" He asked son ""Why is coffee against your religion and mountain dew considered okay?"" Son replied with ""Word of wisdom that's why."" My fiance said ""That doesn't make any sense, soda is so unhealthy, full of chemicals and sugar. Coffee is toasted bean water."" Son got very upset and defensive. Fiance said ""I'm not trying to make you upset I'm genuinely curious"". Son ran to call his dad.  

For clarity my fiance doesn't intend to be antagonizing. He is gentle in the way he speaks to the kids, especially right after they come home from a visit.... The kids are downright awful to me when they get back so no conversation is possible without a breakdown... 

Every single time the kid comes home from his dad's time he goes on and on constantly about how we're going against the church. From alcohol to coffee and everything else. He's 14... He's got brass balls for trying to run the household. He told his step dad that his morning coffee and after work beer (yes singular beer) is against Jesus 👀. We're not even sure how to undo this brainwashing shit. He's in therapy. The therapist didn't really believe it was that bad I showed them the screenshots of multiple times his father pulled similar stunts. It's not enough for us to have full custody... 

* It has nothing to do with religion but I'm still pissed... Ex husband goes on and on about my fiance being the one who owns our home and it's not mine. I'm not on the paperwork so I've got no say.🙄 He says this to the kids.  My fiance built me a home office, has set me up like 15 whimsical bird feeders and a raised garden bed. I'm pretty sure he wants me to stay. 

Bro rents a run down house and has a roommate. His wife has to deal with a roommate at 40. I don't judge other people's financial situations, but I judge the shit out of him. 

My theory is that he wants the kids to feel like there's no stability here, that they can be kicked to the curb anytime. Kids have their own rooms. Fiance encouraged them to pick out their own style and helped them decorate when they moved in.


 My fiance really wanted to adopt them. (He still does) and their father was all for it. (We're talking fiance had a lawyer ready for help with the process.) The asshat's family gave him down the road about it and he back pedaled.. 🤬🤬🤬

 I'm so sorry to rant, and I'm so grateful for this group... I'm sorry this is so heavy. Fuck the LDS church for trying to steal my children. Thank fuck my daughter is more aware and not interested in the bullshit... I left the church to leave it alone. They will punish me till the bitter end for leaving.. It's a fucking cult!

I’m in the early planning stages of launching a small coffee kiosk chain designed specifically for corporate office environments such as building lobbies, shared common areas, and business parks. The idea is to offer high-quality coffee in a compact format that’s convenient for employees and visitors without requiring a full café setup.

At the moment, I’m looking to connect with property managers, building owners, facility managers, or companies that rent out small commercial or kiosk-style spaces inside office buildings. I’m also very open to advice from anyone who has experience placing food or beverage vendors in corporate locations, including tips on how to approach building management or structure rental agreements.

If you manage an office building, work in one that hosts vendors, or know someone who does, I’d really appreciate any leads, insights, or suggestions.

1q80cvl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q80cvl,"Something, something, OC Introduction","**19th of January, 1934**

Royal Nation, Brazillian Territory

Fort ""São João II""

An officer parks their car in the parking lot. They stare at the rear view mirror, adjust their tie, making sure they look alright. They go to the trunk and retrieve a large, red case made out of wood. They gently lower it onto the floor and drag it into the fort.

""Bom dia Brigadeiro Helena."" A soldier greets the passing officer, they stop.

""Bom dia Soldado."" They continue walking.

She hears some angry shouting from another room close by. A peek into the room reveals a young conscript and an angry officer. He had a small spot of coffee on the suit in what appeared to be a small incident.

***""YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THIS SUIT COSTS? I'LL MAKE-""***

*""O BARÃO!""*

*""...""*

""Me passa esse cara."" The officer immediately points to the Brigadier. The Conscript runs up to her and tries to help her carry the crate.

""Do- let me help you with this cr-""

""No need. Just put it down gently."" He does as instructed and the officer leaves in anger. The Brigadier does a head gesture for the Conscript to follow her.

""Entende português?"" They start to walk together.

""Sorry ma'am, i- i didn't understand what you said.""

""Do you speak Portuguese?""

""No ma'am.""

""We will talk in english then."" She gets a bit closer to the Conscript.

""Is this your first day?"" The conscript nods.

""Right. I can give you some tips I believe."" They stop in the middle of a 4 way hallway. Rooks pass  by, carrying lumber and metal on their arms. They then continue on.

They stop by an Officer lounge, one of them, wearing a beret, stares at the two.

""Wait here."" The Brigadier goes inside, leaving the Conscript waiting. The Officer and the Conscript exchange looks several times. The conscript always looks away first though.

The Brigadier returns, putting on a belt filled with important gear.

""Let's keep going."" They reach a cafeteria before the Brigadier starts to talk again.

""Listen, that fool over there? The one raging on because of a coffee spill on his suit? Never saw a skirmish, never saw the people after one too."" The Brigadier says as she looks down.

""He never had to mine, never had to change his clothes because he was too muddy. He never had to wipe blood from his face. Whether it was his own blood, a friend's, or a cultist's."" The Brigadier temporarily looks at the wooden planks that make up the floor.

""That is the problem the Officer Watch faces. Too many people who don't understand what everybody else is going through.""

""Have you seen the frontlines?"" The conscript asks.

""Want to hear about it?"" He then tilts his head.

""I remember back in 1932, I was a Captain back then and we were going to route a cultist base. A small portion of my men were trying to shoot down a Flame Trooper on the high ground.""

""What happened?""

""They were too-... I was too slow and lost 8 men in the blink of an eye.""

""...""

""A surviving Rook, bless that man's soul, he used his grenade launcher and shot where the Flamer was standing and he took a fall. I just went in and punched that guy with all the strength I got.""

""..."" The Brigadier pulls out a golden cross. It had a Russian name.

""These were his tags. I've seen plenty on the Frontlines.""

""How do you manage to stay calm after it all?""

""I sometimes don't, but in public, I need to have the coldest head in the room. Privates, Corporals, Soldats, Conscripts... they can lose their heads and it's okay, war takes its toll on everyone..."" The Brigadier stops walking.

""- but if I lose my head, then everything turns to chaos."" They make their way to the small armory before the train station. Leaving the red box on the ground, she picks up a ""Prince"" Long Rifle for the Conscript.

""Here, take this Prince Rifle. Other guns may look flashier but it won't let you down."" The Conscript holds it with his hands in a non-proper way.

""Here is at least one tip. Stay on the back, and stay in cover. Going through the middle of a hall in the caves is a good way to get shot."" The duo finally reach the train station of the fort. Several trains are being loaded with people, ammo, weapons, food and other supplies.

""Where were you going after this?""

""To Fort Henry in... Colombia I think? They spoke about a Hallowed Ha-"" The Brigadier cuts him off.

""Nonsense. You will come to my campaign. Titan's Way.""

'*What*? I can't ab-""

""You can't abandon your campaign without possible incarceration, but I can make you abandon it with no trouble. Not many people around say otherwise.""

""Here, hop on the wagon and help me place the box on it"" They do as follows. The wagon also had other conscripts inside, wondering who this person was.

""What's inside?""

""Radio Equipment.""

“Bom dia Cavaleiros.”

Some say good day back, some don’t. The door closes and the train turns on the whistle.

""Next stop, Fort Nova Copacabana!"" The train begins to move and the Brigadier crouches, unlocking the red box and revealing the equipment usually seen with Radio Troopers. They put on the headset and start tinkering with the Radio Box.

""This will take a while...""

The box had a message written inside the lid. It reads:

""Let there be light.""

\-----------------------------

I was debating whether to make a crazy ass, devil dog Radio Trooper but i decided to have calm one. If i recall correctly, 90% of officers in lore are pussies but if you are up against a good officer? You are in for a world of hurt.

Helena is part of these 10%. And is part of the smaller, shock trooper category.

I wonder if people will guess why the shock trooper quote is a unique one

Originally from the Midwest, I now reside in New York City. I have a love  for bubble baths (bath bombs are absolutely the best!), and you’ll often find me enjoying iced coffee—yes, even in winter! I love spending time in bookstores, especially when it comes to fiction. I love movies, and some of my all-time favorites include 'The Holiday,' 'The Wizard of Oz,' and 'The Sound of Music.'

I believe I'm a good person—kind and patient, yet not easily taken advantage of. Allow me to share a bit about myself: I don't have much time for socializing due to my demanding work schedule. While I do have friends and engage in activities, my work commitments often align with their free time. They are happily married with children, and I genuinely celebrate their happiness, but our lifestyles are quite different, which is why I find myself here.

I’m a night owl, and I don’t see that changing anytime soon. I enjoy sipping on ice-cold Coca-Cola while diving into audiobooks or catching up on a series or movie.

I lean towards the blue side politically, so please reach out only if you share a similar viewpoint. Additionally, if you devote a lot of time to video games, I’d prefer you not to contact me. Also, if you are a massive sports fan and must watch hours of sports a week, please don’t contact me; that’s not my idea of a good time.

I’m looking to chat with folks aged 25-46 who live in the United States or Canada. Wishing everyone the best in their search!",0,1767937444.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,0.4,False

I’m looking for someone easygoing to grab coffee (or drinks) with. I’m into genuine vibes and good conversation. Not looking for anything serious or heavy right now, just a consistent connection where we can be ourselves. 

If things get physical, great- as long as we’re both honest and respectful about it. *No games, just good energy.*

**About Me:**

• 28, professional, cis-female, and can actually hold a conversation.

• Loves a good brew (coffee or beer, I don't judge).

• Values honesty and ""emotional intelligence"" even in casual setups.

• Not here for the drama, just the vibe.

**About You:**

• Age 27 to 40-ish. (Please be an actual adult, I'm not here to babysit! lol)

• Respectful, hygienic, and knows how to lead a conversation.

• Someone who is ""emotionally present"" (no ghosting or weird games).

• Bonus points if you’re a fellow coffee addict because of work.

He wanted to know if we could meet him for breakfast in the social area. We agreed, as long as it was closer to brunch—around ten. We had gone to bed late the night before, unpacking and trying to organize everything: kitchen boxes in the kitchen, office supplies in the office, and bedroom items neatly stacked in corners, waiting to be put in place.

It felt strange. No landlord had ever invited us to breakfast the morning after moving in. It was odd and a bit amusing, but mostly it made us curious.

We got out of bed, showered, and Jonas put on a pot of coffee. While it brewed, we talked about how everything would look once it was finally in place. We imagined our baby racing through the rooms one day, leaving trails of toys behind her. We discussed the kitchen and the dinners we could have together, just the two of us.

Then my phone rang. It was my dad. He asked how the trip had gone, how the new place felt, and when they could come visit. He said they wanted to help us “unpack.” We talked for a few minutes. I assured him we were fine and that we had already started imagining how things might look.

When I checked the time, we were already ten minutes late. 

“Mr. Landlord,” I called out, since Jonas hadn’t shared his name, and I didn’t know it yet.

As we walked to the social area, we were surprised to find everyone there. Every tenant was gathered, welcoming us with smiles and introductions. Names were exchanged, but I forgot them almost immediately; I remember faces more than names—always have.

Then I heard a child’s voice.

“You must be Mrs. Katherine Muller. I hope you feel this place will be comfortable for you.”

I looked down at him. He looked about nine or ten years old.

“Yes,” he continued, “I’m aware that my vocabulary may seem a little advanced for my age. I hope you’ll excuse it and not find it uncomfortable.”

I was stunned. He spoke better English than I did, and I’d been speaking it much longer than he had.

Faces surrounded me, but since I couldn’t recall names, I started organizing people in my head the only way that made sense. The model-looking woman was married to the man with the real-estate haircut, and the old soul in the young body—Henry—was their son. The car-wash owner was married to the woman who introduced herself as a “marketing professional with a finance degree.” Their son was the shy, polite one. Then there was the nice, charismatic couple who worked at the airport.

I figured if I remembered them this way, I wouldn’t forget who belonged to whom. If I ran into one of them later, I could always ask about their partner without using names. The only advantage I had was remembering Henry's name; I thought I could ask him for everyone else’s names. He must know them.

We had a good time. Everyone talked about how nice the apartments were and how much they loved the suburb. It was a closed community with parks and sports areas, and our complex was just one block away from all of it. 

It did feel perfect, and I agreed. Jonas began talking to the woman who works at the airport. They seemed to hit it off immediately, and I felt happy seeing him connect with someone. A moment later, her husband walked over to me.

“So,” he asked, “how is the community treating you so far?”

I smiled. “I wasn’t expecting to meet all my neighbors like this,” I replied. “But I guess things are different in different places.”

He nodded and explained that it mattered to the landlord. He believed four families could live in harmony if they felt safe and were expected to rely on one another if anything was needed. This was how things worked here—community events, gatherings, shared spaces.

It was new to me, but I thought, let’s adapt and see how this goes.

Then he paused. 

“I’m sorry,” he said. “My name is Lucas Whitmore. I think I missed yours earlier; it was a little loud.”

I smiled. “Katherine,” I said. “Katherine Muller. Nice to meet you.”",1,1767936777.0,u_JuliettCastle,0,1.0,False

——

    Vivienne Burch was a 21-year-old college student; she’d just been through one of the worst exams of her life. It was fairly easy stuff, simple math, but she’d been scatterbrained all day leading up to it, and she felt she hadn’t performed to her full potential.

    As of right now, she was speedwalking down a steep hill, trying to get as far away from her college campus as possible. She needed to be distracted asap; her mind was reeling, replaying all the exam questions and thinking about what she could have done better.

    The hill starts to level out as she walks, shifting her focus to her surroundings. She sees the thin road with small shops on either side of her, and down the road, she can see two McDonald’s directly across from one another. She thinks about the importance of having two so close together. What was the point? 

    Whatever weird marketing this was, she had to admit - it was working. She walked closer to them, looking a little closer at the signs outside. One was a drive-thru only, and one was an open, cafe-esque walk-in only restaurant. She takes a moment to cross the street towards the walk-in restaurant. She deserved a treat after such a catastrophic failure of an exam. 

    Vivienne walks toward the open wall of the restaurant, no door, just a completely open front wall revealing a quaint cafe-like interior, a stark contrast to most McDonald's in the area. She walks up to the bar height area where a crew member is smiling widely at a customer, a small line with a diverse group of people behind the customer. Two kiosks stand next to the line, with a few people scattered nearby presumably waiting to use them. Vivienne walks up to the line and stands beside one of the kiosks. A man shifts awkwardly beside her, her eyes drawn to the movement- 

    “Oh I'm sorry, did I cut in line?” She says, her eyebrows raised as she takes a step back, and the man plus two other men step up to the kiosk without a word. Vivienne steps back into the line, rolling on her heels as she waits. The man, and his friends snicker and chuckle. Vivienne peers subtly over their shoulders seeing exactly what they're laughing at, a 500$ order with a copious number of random food items and drinks. 

    The man turns around, catching Vivienne staring at the screen with her eyebrows raised, she looks away quickly, slightly embarrassed. He speaks up first “Come look” He says, putting a hand on Viviennes’ shoulder to guide her closer to the kiosk screen. “We have, like, a hack.” He starts with a mischievous grin, his friends snickering beside him. Vivienne gives him a concerned look, but he doesn’t seem fazed, continuing on to the payment screen. “So you go here, click ‘Pay with iPhone’ and..” Vivienne watches as a big payment declined box appears on the screen. She chuckles despite her awkwardness, but he holds out a hand infront of himself “Just wait..”       

    Vivienne watches as he pulls out a card, tapping it discreetly on the card reader, the payment goes through and he smiles big at her. “See, simple, free food.” He says his friends are practically keeling over with near silent laughter. “I don’t get it. All you did was pay for your food?” Vivienne says, her brows furrowed slightly in confusion. The man slaps a hand on her back, chuckling as he leans down conspiratorially “See the trick is. This isn’t my card” He says wiggling his eyebrows. ‘Why would he tell me that?’ She thinks to herself as she steps away and back in line, ‘just casually making me an accomplice to theft?’ She shakes her head waiting for her turn to order. 

   The men don’t say anything else, just wait in line as they get closer to the pickup area. Vivienne's palms sweat as she’s filled with an inner turmoil, should she say something? Should she tell someone that these random men are using someone else’s debit card? She has no way of proving it, but her instincts are telling her they weren’t lying. 

The men make it to the pickup area, casually chatting to the crew member about their order, their backs are turned to Vivienne. The crew member makes eye contact with Vivienne, and she decides now will be the only time to act, Vivienne shakes her head discreetly, shooting a look at the backs of the men the crew member was talking to. She hopes he caught on to her subtle gesture. Not even two minutes later a manager walks up behind the crew member speaking as he gestures for the crew guy to leave. “We got a ping that your payment was declined. We can’t serve you. And you’ll need to leave the premises.”  The manager shoots a knowing look at Vivienne with a nod. 

     The men don't make much of a fuss, one of them sighs and they all exit the building. Vivienne sighs, her shoulders relaxing from a tension she didn’t realize she was carrying. She waits, as the person ahead of her orders, then, it’s finally her turn. She was going to get that iced coffee at long last. She walks up to the crew member a performed smile on her face “I’ll have a-“ 

   The ground shakes as a side door slams open, far too much force to be a casual customer. Viviennes’ head whips around a shocked expression on her face, seeing the same man, his friends, and about ten other masked individuals burst through the door armed to the teeth with assault rifles and other weapons wrapped in.. tinfoil? Her confusion is quickly replaced with a look of terror as the men rush in with practiced ease, aiming at the customers and crew members keeping everyone in place. “You.” The man Vivienne had spoken to earlier points her out, walking with purpose towards her. “Sit.” Vivienne is stun locked as the man approaches, he and his friend grabbing onto Viviennes’ arms and tossing her into a nearby booth.

1q7zsml,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrevilleCoffee/comments/1q7zsml/losing_my_mind_trying_to_pull_a_good_shot_on_a/,Losing my mind trying to pull a good shot on a new Barista Express," So I recently picked up a new Breville Barista Express and started off with some Peet’s dark roast beans just to get familiar with the machine. After playing with the grind, I ended up having to set the inner burr to 1 and the grind knob all the way down to 1 to get a drinkable double shot. I was pulling a 1:2 ratio using manual mode, usually around 26 seconds from button press to finish.



Americanos tasted fine, and I even made a decent flat white, but I really wanted that straight espresso experience I’ve had at good coffee shops.



To get a baseline, I went to a local roaster and ordered a single shot of espresso — it was excellent. I bought a bag of their espresso blend, which they said was roasted just a few days ago.



Got home, weighed out 18g into the portafilter, and went to town… and immediately ran into problems. These beans are smaller and lighter roasted, and with my original 1/1 grind setting, the machine basically choked and wouldn’t extract anything.



So I started adjusting the grind until I could get a 1:2 ratio. The result? Extremely bitter**.** Like, I could smell how bad it was going to taste before drinking it. I went coarser, still bitter. Same result every time.



At this point I figured maybe it was just the beans, so I tried a bag of Lavazza Super Crema. Dialed it in for a 1:2 ratio… same thing. Bitter as hell. Tried longer extractions up to 50g out, barely any improvement.



Right now I’m sitting at inner burr 4, grind knob 8. If I go coarse, the shots get watery but still bitter. Go finer, still bitter.



I feel like I’ve tried everything and I’m officially losing my mind 😂

(im a 15yo girl. literally cant leave this hell)

going through my personal space really often

going through my things secretly, without telling me (usually when I'm away so i don't know)

looking through my phone, again, without telling me why or what for

guilt tripping me into taking SSRIs and threatening ""removal of privileges"" if i don't comply

living out in the middle of nowhere between some hills, house not visible from the road, nearest neighbors really far, always ordering things online and not going into stores, my mom staying home all the time

complaining that i'm making them broke by having basic needs when my mom sits with my 4yo brother all day despite having a degree and being capable of working a job. she spends this time looking at memes on facebook and texting her guy friends.

babying the littles. they aren't that little. the 4yo isn't potty trained and they blame him and not the fact that they didn't bother to start telling him what it even is until he was 2-3ish. 

and the 8yo gets to stay home if she has a cough. she's missed over half the school year. i'm throwing up in the school bathroom and they guilt trip me for missing class.

i'm guilt tripped also if i don't want to be touched. ""oh so you don't love me?"" no grandma i just have boundaries and am very sensitive to touch. mom stop glaring at me.

if i bring up how they hurt me, they brush it off and say i'm playing the victim

if i bring it up to a different safe adult and they find out (because they micromanage my life) they say not to tell anyone else what goes on with them because it's ""embarassing""

my basic needs are ""priveleges"" that have to be earned, apparently.

they take my phone, control where i go and when and how long and with who, they decide who i'm allowed to interact with and about what, and i'm blessed with entire periods of isolation (helloooo summer.)

i only get privacy if i behave. if i say ""can i please just have a bathroom door"" they're like oh okay what are you hiding

they accuse me of hiding all the time and look through my shit...like i don't even know what they're looking for. the only hiding im doing is hiding from you

they complain i don't spend enough time with them and that's why i'm always ""moody""

they tell their friends and family that i'm so moody and ungrateful and stupid. yes i have evidence. 

they don't fucking communicate! like they're like hey you did something wrong and i'm like what did i do and whats wrong with it and nope they're just like ALRIGHTYYY PUNISHMENT TIME. bye bye priveleges. 

half the time they don't even answer my serious questions like ""why did you take my phone"" and then they'll make a joke or sarcastic remark or change the subject or start scrolling. all i want is to understand atp

if i'm fr about anything, they do\^\^ that shit. But then they're like ""so you should NEVER lie to us"" so now i downplay things and panic and hide and stuff...im not being sneaky im just trying to survive

if i bring this up (again, i met them over coffee with a list of what i was feeling and what they were doing that i found unfair, very mature of me tbh) they wliterally are like ""stop playing the victim, we're human too we make mistakes"" abuse aint no mistake 

then they frame control as ""care"" like weeerreee just tryinggg to protect youuuu!!! okay protection doesnt require surveillance cameras throughout the house and cutting me off from support but live your life

also i have to make like a secret plan of like ""okay im setting aside this comfort snack and this letter to myself and this world in my head just to survive this month""

they make being sewerslidal MY FAULT. they're like ""well yeah you isolate yourself"" girl... ""you're stressing us out"" I'M stressing YOU out?! meanwhile when i enter a new location i immediately come up with 2 plans and a backup??

i dont actually ever feel safe here i just like that its familiar. like i pick the demon i already know

you know what i'm pretty goddamn shocked that i'm still alive, that i get out of bed to go to school each day, because most of the time i'd love to know if they'd feel guilty if their ""lazy"" and ""ungrateful"" eldest daughter was their dead one.

also ""ungrateful""? i am anything but. i can't even accept favors i get so uncomfortable 

My mom shames me for talking to my bio dad ""without her permission"" my bad he sees me as human (now at least) and then she said ""yeah you're just airing out our laundry to him"" as if she doesn't talk to him all day every day now and send people photos of me without my consent like ok ""mom""

they like to pull the ""your family is the only ones who stick around, your friends and lovers will come and go but your family you need to appreciate more"" great now say that to someone whos father left Oh wait you just did ;\_;

i'll go upstairs (my rooms in basement) and pick up my phone to see who's notificationing me and my mom's like Do i need to take the phone away. Like my bad, this is the only place im allowed it okay? my bad i wanted connection with nontoxic people

if i accidentally sleep in they'd be like ""how dare you miss the bus and be an inconvenience to us at home"" like you keep me at home all the time bruh what u shitting about

others are like ""your mom is so cool/nice"" yeah thats what she presents. thanks. 

my mom thinks everyone is out to get her. the government, the men, the internet, the workforce, my friends, her friends, aliens, satan, who knows. she's so paranoid. its tough to live with honestly

i'll bring up a thing i want to try and they'll tell me everything wrong with it and why i shouldn't

my mom oh god doesn't yell she just guilt trips and stonewalls or start crying about her past

my stepdad tho he yells and will like get physical which is why i NEVER EVER provoke him im dead afraid

Oh also the religious trauma? since BIRTH my brain's been pounded with ""hell! the rapture! demons! demons will get you! spiritual warfare! satan! purity! submission!"" like maybe not guys im 5

my mom found out that i sh'd and she started crying about her past and how she used to.

my younger half siblings (kids of my mom + stepdad) get all the gentleness and the babying and leniencies and advantage and if they mess up ""oh its okay you're learning"" but if i mess up ""after all we did for you?""

once i forgot my phone in my pocket and went downstairs to use the washroom and then my mom called me like 12 times and when i got back upstairs she was like ""there will be consequences"" and im like ""im so sorry i forgot"" and she was like ""you're not allowed to do that"" like????? my bad???? i have shit memory???? my fault i guess

they always blame my ""tone"" whenever i'm hurt by them backlashing. like ah yes y/n you gotted triggered or sum

i be thinking at 9am like ""theres only one way out of this house"" and eyeing my meds

if i'm quiet i'm ""showing attitude"" but if i speak up im ""talking back""

the WORST part: they're not horrible to me even half the time. they'll joke and i'll think okay maybe i was overreacting and mind you the rules are still in place i just crave that parental bond and when they're fun it feels like it's fine and then i think i was wrong and imagining it but then it comes back around every time. i brought this up and they were like ""oh so you're mad at us for being nice then?"" Like no i just can't hate you that would be rude but you've also traumatized me and are the reason for most of my problems. and sometimes i wish they'd do something really horrible so that i'd feel more valid 

i just love my family so much and am so grateful teehee<3

1q7znis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1q7znis/you_deserve_the_world/,You deserve the world,"Dear T, 
First and foremost happy birthday. I do remember, I remember you love strong coffee. I remember many key moments between us like this particular detail, the memorable post you send on IG was “Girls don’t want to be called cute, baby or other pet names. Step up your game and call her Supreme Leader” Star Wars humor is a major green flag in my opinion. I had you on my phone as supreme leader T from that day forward.

You deserve to know the truth. I did and still do love you that part was never fabricated however the reason I couldn’t go through with our relationship was because the entire situation was affecting me both mentally and physically. It was taken a severe toll on me and although I wanted you more than anything the complexity and constant overthinking plagued my very soul. I couldn’t sleep, I didnt eat
I couldn’t even recognize myself half the time. My heart was in constant anxiety my brain was always on high alert. In truth I was afraid. I was afraid of the uncertainty and the unknown that came with taking that first step in being together. And for that I’m sorry, I’m sorry for the empty promises and the broken heart. Hearing you cry that day broke me in more ways than one. Forgive me T

You are so sweet and pure and a wonderful mother. I wish I could say that to you in person one last time over a cup of coffee, laugh at your witty humor see that warm smile again. 
I hope life has been treating you well, I hope you are safe and happy. I pray everyday hoping you are doing well and thriving. 

Yours truly, D

1q7zm2u,https://www.reddit.com/r/PubTips/comments/1q7zm2u/qcrit_the_rubble_romantic_thriller_82k_words/,[QCrit] THE RUBBLE | Romantic Thriller  | 82k words | First attempt,"Hello everyone,  
A very happy new year.  I shall be extremely grateful for constructive feedback on this query. This is my first attempt. I have narrowed down on a few comps but any help will be very helpful .   
  
Dear Agent,

THE RUBBLE is a romantic thriller complete at 82000 words. Told in a dual timeline that interlocks like a zipper. The NOW, a breathless survival thriller; THEN, an intimate unraveling of love and identity. The novel is an intense and emotionally charged tale that will appeal to the readers of \[comps\].  
  
Akash—a workaholic, introverted, painfully unexpressive network engineer, never expected his life to end buried under a collapsed server room in Silicon Valley. Pinned beneath rubble of shattered concrete and bent metal, Akash’s world shrinks to a broken phone that’s already dying. The screen flickers. There are no signal bars. The battery drops like a countdown to his death. And above ground, his wife Anjali is leaving him for good—tired of his workaholism, empty apologies, broken promises and of a marriage reduced to mechanical text messages.

Akash’s only motivation for survival is his undying love for Anjali—love he has carried like a secret he never learned to say out loud. With the battery draining every second, he must use all his engineering talent to somehow reach Anjali before she walks away forever.

Trapped in darkness, Akash is forced to do what he has avoided his whole life: face the past he buried under duty and denial. With each shift of debris, his life flashes in jagged frames—his growing distance from Anjali, the feelings he never confessed, the constant uncertainty of immigration, the childhood scars that shaped his personality, and the fatal mistake of trusting the wrong person. A mistake that doesn’t just threaten his marriage. It makes his survival almost impossible.

Frist 300:

UNDER THE RUBBLE  – TEN HOURS ELEVEN MINUTES UNTIL ANJALI LEAVES.

I wake up in darkness.

Disoriented and confused, my throat raw as I struggle to suck in air.

I cough, gasping for air, and immediately realize I can barely move. I’m lying down, my body pressed against something hard and unyielding.

I cough again, hard, and the sound dies instantly. Dust coats my tongue. My mouth is dry like I’ve been chewing chalk.

Panic surges as I try to move, but there's no room to stretch, no space to even shift slightly.

My heartbeat hammers against my ribs, loud in this sealed silence. The air feels dead—thin and stale, like it’s been sitting here for years waiting for me. Each inhale is shallow, unfinished. My head throbs and my ears ring, a high metallic whine that blurs everything else.

I swallow. It hurts.

“Help!” I croak, my voice barely a whisper.

I force my throat open and try again, louder, dragging the sound up from somewhere deep and terrified.

“Help!” I shout, and the shout cracks halfway, turning into a desperate bark.

Silence.

Then—somewhere close—metal shifts with a slow, sickening groan. Concrete grit trickles down and kisses my cheek.

I freeze. Every nerve in me goes rigid.

“Is anyone there?” I call, voice trembling. “Please—please, help me!”

My words echo in the darkness, bouncing off nothing.

There’s no response, just the groan of shifting metal and the hollow sound of my own voice fading away. My chest tightens as I try to recall how I ended up here. The memory hits me in flashes, and I can’t stop it from replaying in my mind.

This is supposed to be a long weekend—the kind of holiday when Silicon Valley seems abandoned, almost haunted by emptiness. I recall driving down University Avenue in Palo Alto, the usual buzz of students and tourists is replaced by eerie silence. Philz Coffee, where lines usually snake out onto the sidewalk, stands deserted, dark windows reflecting nothing but empty streets and vacant storefronts. No chatter. No espresso machines screaming. Just emptiness.",1,1767935926.0,PubTips,0,1.0,False
1q7zkve,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q7zkve,New addition to coffee station and pour over kind of day!,"Picked up a bean dose tube stand from Cafistiq. First impressions are solid. I wouldn’t put it in the “premium” category like I did Knodos, but it feels sturdy, well made, and genuinely practical…especially on busier mornings. Definitely something I see myself using long-term. Will start test for vacuum seal and ease of use.


Went back to basics with latte art and tried to dial in Monk’s Head again under a friend’s guidance. Last night’s session was great; this morning… not so much. Steaming went sideways, as you can probably tell, so I abandoned ship and made a pourover to restore morale.


Happy Friday.

I got a pack of Canva templates off Etsy that included food labels and I want as many of them as possible to be on theme.

Here’s what I have so far: 
- Rocket Fuel (coffee bar station) 
- Moon Juice (going to make a kid friendly color changing lemonade concoction with star shaped ice cubes) 
- Saturn Rings (bagel station) 
- Moon Rocks (donut holes) 

Here’s what I need space-themed name ideas for:
- Adult Bar (mimosas, screwdrivers, Irish coffee station) 
- Egg bake/fritatta station 
- Yogurt parfait station (single serve yogurt cups with blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries and granola to mix in)
-Fruit platter 

I’m open to the fact that not everything *needs* a fun space themed name, but I thought I’d try posting here and see if anyone has ideas! Or if you have any spins on what I’ve already thought of, as using “moon” twice feels a bit repetitive. Thanks in advance people of Reddit! ",0,1767935801.0,partyplanning,1,0.5,False

1q7zjyr,https://www.reddit.com/r/directsupport/comments/1q7zjyr/fatigue_and_scheduling_for_worklife_balance/,Fatigue and scheduling for work-life balance,"I work at an IRA on a current schedule of second shift Monday, second and third shift 16 hour double on Friday, and a 12 hour overnight 7-7 on Saturday night. One weekend, after getting stuck for an extra hour on Saturday morning and when there was no coffee, I may have nodded off on the last hour of my shift on Sunday morning. Anyway, quality standards now seems concerned by my schedule and I find it tiring too as I have always gotten more fatigued in the winter than in the warmer months when I started. However, I worry about keeping work-life balance as too many second shifts makes it hard to have time to see friends when they're available and I am a pretty community-minded and friendship-oriented person. My coworker who I'll call L says he likes overnights the best but he is currently scheduled on all second shifts Sunday-Thursday. The minimum staffing for the house is two during the day and evening on Monday through Friday morning, but then only one Friday afternoon through the weekend as some residents go home to their families then. L also can't drive and failed to become med certified, meaning he can't do two of the things I do for the job that are not necessary on the 11-7 overnight hours. L also spends a lot of time just watching videos in the office and not interacting with residents when they are up and doing stuff, and on Mondays I find myself cooking all the food and helping residents while he just watches videos or looks at online shopping sites. Additionally, one resident who is with her mom from Friday afternoon to Monday morning every week needs bathing assistance that her plan requires a female staff for which necessitates a third staff on Monday evening even when L and I are both present. L is also the only staff permanently scheduled on Thursday evening, which is the time of my most important social event of the week so I normally don't work then, so both a relief staff for the one resident's bath and a med staff to come for meds need to be scheduled in every week. There is also no staff permanently scheduled for second shift on Saturdays. There is no position posted for the house despite these holes. On Monday, Thursday, and Friday there are two DSPs in addition to the team director on first shift but on Tuesdays and Wednesdays there is only one. I am kind of wondering if it would be possible for me to switch to the Tuesday and Wednesday mornings if L could switch to my two overnights and just Tuesday-Thursday evenings, he said he might be open to the idea though he does kind of like having Friday and Saturday off even though he usually picks up shifts on them. It seems like it would run more smoothly if the house had an additional regular staff, and if I eventually switched off Fridays that would leave room for a position of similar times three days in a row, possibly plus Mondays but Mondays need a third staff even with L and I both there which seems to me like not the most efficient staffing pattern. Do you think they would ever post that so that I might eventually be able to work something more like a four day Sunday-Wednesday week with only two second shifts and not the overnights I find boring and get especially fatigued on in colder months? I am willing to keep working Fridays for now and will do overnights if it's the only way to have enough evenings free, I just would eventually like a schedule that will limit and burn me out less.",1,1767935748.0,directsupport,0,1.0,False
1q7zj8i,https://www.reddit.com/r/notebooklm/comments/1q7zj8i/ebooks_notebooklm_how_i_save_difficult_chapters/,"eBooks + NotebookLM: How I ""save"" difficult chapters without re-reading (Workflow) 📚🧠","Disclaimer:   
  
**The Problem:** You finish a chapter, realize you absorbed nothing, but dread re-reading it. **The Fix:** A quick export to NotebookLM to visualize the scene instead of reading it again.

Here is how I turn a ""lost"" chapter into a clear mental map in 5 minutes:

# The Workflow ⚙️

1. **Open Kindle on PC (or any app that allows copying text):** This is crucial because copying text on mobile apps is often tedious. On the PC app, Cloud Reader, or any other desktop reader, it’s easier to highlight and copy larger chunks.
2. **Copy the Chapter:** I grab the text of the specific chapter I just struggled with.
   * *Note on DRM:* Be aware that publishers set copy limits (clipboard limits) on Kindle books. If you hit the limit, you might get a warning. Usually, copying one chapter at a time works fine for me, but YMMV based on the specific book settings.
3. **Paste into NotebookLM:** Create a new notebook and paste the text as a ""Copied Text"" source.

# What I ask it to do (The Prompts) 🤖

Once the text is in, I don't just ask for a summary. I use the tools to ""see"" the data differently:

* **The ""Vibe Check"" (Audio Overview):** I start with the Audio Overview. It’s perfect for letting two ""hosts"" discuss the chapter while I grab a coffee. It often highlights themes I completely missed while struggling with the syntax.
* **The Visualization (e.g., for Mystery/Fantasy):** If users are in a complex location (like a Cluedo board scenario), I ask: *""Create a room plan/layout based on the descriptions. Who is standing where? What does the room look like from top-down?""* It helps visualize the scene vividly.
* **Character Tracking (Data Table):** I ask it to format a table of characters present in the chapter, their current status, and their hidden motives mentioned in the text.
* **Flashcards:** I use the Study Guide/Flashcard feature to test if I actually retained the key plot points this time.
* **Slide Deck:** I ask it to structure the key events as a presentation outline. This forces the AI to break down the narrative arc into logical steps.

# Why this works

It turns passive, confused reading into active engagement. Instead of re-reading a wall of text, I’m looking at a generated ""map"" of the room or listening to a discussion about it. It fills in the gaps where my focus drifted.",8,1767935686.0,notebooklm,2,0.9,False

Now we have no internet because the App cannot initiate the activation process.,"My wife and I are full-time remote workers from home and having issues with our internet, like delays during Teams calls (missing people's audio, frozen screens, etc) as well as video buffering issues on the FloSports app.

I considered adding a mesh network, but we called Xfinity since the first since the base modem is probably 5 years old. The support rep recommends upgrading from the old modem. My wife goes to the local Xfinity store and the salesguy hands her this new one and some simple instructions, says it will be easy.

Plug it in, let it boot up, go to the iOS App. She did this before I got home and in the wrong order (power first, then set up new network name & password) but that shouldn't matter.

We click on either UI element that says Activate device. It goes to a new page and gives us (...) then kicks us back to the Overview. Nothing changed. We tried on two different iOS phones, both modern, freshly downloaded apps.

The chatbot in the app is no help. It keeps trying to tell us we have no internet plan while we are logged in looking at our internet plan.

The phone number included in the instructions is no help. It tells us to use the app and hangs up.

I can connect to the router once it boots up. The network name and password is on the bottom. Problem is, the WiFi settings interface tells you go to the app and never finishes the connection.

I even looked for a factory reset button, even though the default password is connecting but there does not seem to be one on this device (no pinhole or small button).

I've been setting up Comcast accounts in various forms for 25 years. Never have I seen something that was designed to be ""simple"" and resulted in an absolute dead-end for a highly technical person. I build software for a living, and this is crud.

Now I cannot work tomorrow without tethering to my phone or going to a coffee shop. Back to the Xfinity store tomorrow? Does someone need to deactivate the old modem? What is going on?!",4,1767935542.0,Comcast_Xfinity,7,1.0,False

I (28F) have been married to my partner (33F) for 3 years now. We actually just had our anniversary days ago, although we have been together for 6 years in total. I love my wife very much, but for almost our entire marriage our sex life has become more and more sparse.
I have tried my best to communicate my desire for more regular intimacy and my wife has told me she wants that as well, but nothing seems to happen.
We go months without anything happening at all aside from us just kissing and even that feels lackluster at times.
We used to have a very fruitful and fulfilling relationship. I felt like we so in sync and just so in love and I feel so disconnected to her because of the lack of intimacy.
It used to be only a month or two, maybe three without us doing anything, but as time goes on it seems like we have larger gaps of us not being intimate.
I know intimacy is more than just sex, but this is something I struggled to ever feel like I would enjoy with another person before her and this is my first time really feeling a strong desire to have that with another person.
I will also include that my wife does acts of kindness for me like just buying me a hoodie or buying me a coffee or just things of that nature without me asking because she knows I really enjoy those things. She has done so much for me in the course of our relationship that has made me feel appreciated and cared for that I couldn’t even express without making dozens of paragraphs.
It just feels like this one thing we both used to be so in-sync with and we both enjoyed feels one sided now. I don’t know if I’m being dramatic, I just feel lost.
She has previously purchased a dating idea book for us to do things and this was at least a year or two ago now when she bought it and we had only done two out of entire book of things because she never had the energy to do anything or didn’t want to spend the money, etc.
So we haven’t used the dating book since and it makes me sad to think about because she is the one who bought it for us and we never do anything in it.
She has also purchased a similar book, but one that was geared towards bedroom activities.
I had scratched off ideas from the book for us to try (the books was geared towards heterosexual relationships) but we didn’t end up doing anything in that book either.
Flash forward after I have asked if we could do things in either of books and there was seemingly an excuse for why we couldn’t.
At the beginning of Feb 2025, we purchased a house together and I ended up throwing the bedroom book away because I was tired of asking about things we could do and not doing them and I was just upset.
She didn’t really seem to care that I threw it away when I eventually told her though.
I know this is probably doesn’t make much sense, but essentially we had a fruitful and love relationship that was full of intimacy and passion. I felt loved for the first time in my life by someone and I felt wanted in a way I never knew I could.
I don’t really feel this way anymore.
We have had may conversations about this subject of the lack of intimacy and it just kind of always derails when I bring it up or she gets upset and says I make her feel bad.
I don’t know what else to do.
I’ve suggested marriage counseling, but she wasn’t willing for us to do that either due to money, which I understand but I feel like we cannot overcome this hurdle on our own.
I’m just hoping someone, literally anyone could make a suggestion of what I should do.
I love my wife and I believe she loves me, but this lack of intimacy and physical connection makes me wonder if maybe she’s lost attraction to me.
I feel like perhaps I am now becoming less attracted to her, but I also don’t want that to be the case and I want to bring the spark back in our relationship.
I feel so hopeless thinking about it at times and how it’s hurting our relationship and I feel like I’m the only person who cares about it…

TL;DR I need suggestions for my marriage that is becoming less and less intimate as our relationship progresses.",1,1767935110.0,marriageadvice,0,0.99,False

As you can see from this update, I’m not dead… yet. As you can see from the amount of time that has passed since my last update, things haven’t gone as planned. But I should start from the beginning.

When I drove to the mansion the next morning, to drop off the bag of what used to be Sally, it was as if nothing had happened. Daisy was still talkative and cheerful as usual. Lord Cyrus was busy banging out Liszt on the piano, and barely looked in my direction. Daisy clearly hadn't told him about our fight. The only acknowledgement from Daisy was her saying she was glad that I recovered from my “little outburst.” 

A few days later, Daisy came to my apartment. I was supposed to drive her downtown to go shopping. She let herself in without knocking, as usual. Rather than sit, she chose to hover above my couch. I was already buzzing with anxiety, but her floating made me even more nervous. It would make my task so much harder. I had to clench every muscle in my body to get myself to sit in place.

She was blathering on and on about some writer Lord Cyrus was friends with who got cancelled and all the drama that ensued. I let her talk, hoping she would exhaust herself into sitting still. But after she was done with her ramble and ready to leave, she was still floating around the ceiling like a forgotten birthday balloon. Ah well. It was now or never.

“I just need to finish one more thing,” I said, standing up.

Daisy was on her phone, opening Instagram. “Don’t keep me waiting,” she giggled. At that point, she was practically upside down, her head above her feet, her paisley dress fluttering around her knees. She looked adorable. For a moment, I could see her as I did on that very first Tinder date- beautiful, sweet, and unassuming. Which only made me feel worse about what I was about to do.

“I’m sorry,” I blurted out before I could stop myself.

“For what?” she asked, half-paying attention.

I didn’t answer. I reached underneath my jacket, took out the revolver, and fired. 

My first shot missed- her head had floated just a bit to the right, so the bullet whizzed past her ear. Before she could react, I fired again. It hit her right in her left eye. The third shot went into her neck. She fell out of the air, the thud shaking the floor. I didn’t hesitate- I barely looked. I fired every remaining bullet into her body, just to be safe. I slowly made my way over, grabbing a wooden garden stake from between the chair cushions. I jammed it into her chest and stomped on it until it wouldn’t go in anymore. It was worth a shot- maybe the vampire legends had some truth in them. The whole time, she didn’t move or make a sound. I checked her pulse. There was none. No breathing either. She was dead.

It had been years since I’d seen Daisy bleed. Her blood didn’t flow out: it oozed, black and gelatinous. Like it had been rotting before Daisy had even died. How could such a pretty girl have the blood of a decomposing corpse?

I realized, suddenly, that I was panting and covered in sweat. Like I’d just been running for my life. True, it wasn’t easy to fire the revolver- I had only swiped it from Lord Cyrus’ room the last time I visited, and practiced with it for a few minutes in their basement when I told them I was in the bathroom. My ears were also ringing furiously. I hadn’t noticed in the moment, but those shots must have been deafening in my small apartment. I stood there, numb with the aftertaste of adrenaline, until a high-pitched, hysterical laugh burst out of me.

I killed her. I actually killed her. I did it! I fucking did it! I just had to kill Lord Cyrus next, and I’d be free. I’d leave Pittsburgh and never look back. I’d travel the world and date a thousand girls who look like Daisy with warm hands and kind hearts. I felt invincible! And yet.. I felt guilty. Maybe because she was so innocent-looking. Or maybe because I’d grown attached to her, like a weird case of Stockholm syndrome. But I still got the feeling I had done something evil to someone who cared about me. Her brilliant blue eyes would shine no longer. Her constant chatter had finally ceased. She was gone. Which meant I was finally free. I let out another laugh- a harsh, barking sound I’d never made before- that quickly turned into a sob. 

I don’t know how much time passed before a thought suddenly broke through- the body! I had to get rid of her body! Fortunately I had planned for that. I bundled her into a trash bag and stashed it in the coat closet until around midnight. Then I lugged the bag into the trunk of my car, and took off towards a wooded area near just outside the city. It was off the side of the highway. No homes or businesses around, which, hopefully, meant no security cameras or curious passersby. 

I’m not sure what I was more afraid of- the fact that I was covering up my own murder or the fact that I was alone in the woods at midnight. Most of the trees had lost their leaves, which made me feel weirdly exposed. I couldn’t see any animals, but I could hear them. The clicking of bugs, the chittering of squirrels or raccoons or God knows what. I even, occasionally, heard the hoot of an owl. My only light came from the sliver of the moon through the bare branches. I didn’t dare use a flashlight, in case someone could see.

Things went from bad to worse when the trash bag caught on a fallen branch and ripped. Strongest bag on the market, my ass. I tried not to look at the aftermath- thinking of those porcelain limbs streaked with dirt and dead leaves and rotten blood made my stomach turn. I tried to use the shovel I’d brought, but after several minutes my shoulders were screaming with pain, and I hadn’t cleared more than an inch of dirt. I may as well have been shoveling into bedrock. I gave up and settled for covering her with dead leaves. Not the most thorough body disposal, but it’s not like anyone came out here anyway. By the time someone found her, I’d be long gone.

After she was sufficiently covered, I made my way back to my car and drove away. I felt- I *knew*\- I had done a public service, but I still felt like I’d committed a horrific crime. Burying a body in the woods has never been exactly a noble act. But I’d take one woodland burial over hundreds of Daisy’s potential victims fed to the incinerator.

Unable to sleep, I spent the rest of the night with the next part of my plan: killing Lord Cyrus. Well into the morning, as I hunched drowsily over my laptop, studying the map I made of the mansion, I heard the front door open.

“Elliot? Are you ready for our shopping trip?”

That voice was unmistakable. I bolted out of my seat, throwing off my blanket and knocking over my cup of coffee. My chest seized, as if all the oxygen in the room had gone out. It couldn’t be. The guilt… it was finally getting to me. I was hearing voices-

“*I said,* have you gotten yourself ready?” The owner of that voice walked into the room. It was as if nothing had happened. Her wounds were all gone. She was completely clean of dirt and blood. She was smiling at me, as she didn’t remember I’d emptied a revolver into her a day ago. The only thing different was her outfit- also clean and new. *I thought… How? How did she*…?

I felt like the room was spinning, so much so that I had to grip the back of my chair to stay upright. She was dead. *She was dead!* No pulse. No breathing. Not a stirring of life, all the time I hid her in the closet and dragged her through the woods. 

Daisy grimaced. “What’s the matter, Elliot? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”

I figured a vampire would be hard to kill. But to die and come back…?

So be it. I just had to try again. “I’m fine,” I said, gritting my teeth into a smile. “Let’s go shopping.”

I really did try. That evening, after we exited a restaurant, I lured her into an alleyway. I told her I saw a man lurking there who would make for an excellent meal. She took a few steps in, suspicious but ravenous. I grabbed her from behind, producing a swiss army knife from my pocket. A few quick slashes to her throat, and that disgusting black blood was spraying against the alley walls. It would have been too conspicuous to move her, so I just tossed her in the dumpster a few feet away.

I’m not sure how I felt, at the time. Looking back, I guess I felt nothing. It was someone else grabbing Daisy in the alley. The knife was in someone else’s hand. I had exhausted myself of all the joy and guilt that came with my first murder attempt. Now I was all business.

She came back. She called me the next day, asking me to go to the opera with her and Lord Cyrus. When I picked them up at the mansion, she was reading a copy of *The Talented Mr. Ripley*, wearing a sparkling evening gown, looking very much alive. Once again, no acknowledgement of what I’d done. 

What else could I do? I couldn’t give up. I had to keep trying. I understand that what I was doing was akin to Sisyphus rolling the boulder up a hill. But what would you do, in my place? Allow Daisy to continue her nightly murder spree? And even if none of my attempts worked, maybe I’d eventually learn why her deaths never seemed to take.

Next time she came to my house, I served her a pie laced with rat poison. I found her slumped on the kitchen table, facedown in her own vomit. That time, I placed bricks in the garbage bag and dumped it in the Allegheny river. The next day she texted me a photo of herself at a street fair.

I surprised her at the street fair and convinced her to let me give her a ride home. I drove the car into an empty lot, then turned around and bashed her skull in with a hammer. Once night fell, I left her underneath a deserted overpass. The next day, as I was cleaning the blood out of my car, she called and asked me to come over. Lord Cyrus wasn’t home, and she needed help moving her new bookshelf.

At that point, I wasn’t shocked or scared. I just gave a disappointed sigh. Why would the girl who has the strength of five men need help moving furniture? But then a thought hit me- Lord Cyrus wasn’t home. I might not have to settle for dumping her body somewhere. I could use the incinerator!

Within half an hour I was knocking on the door of their mansion. Daisy let me, grinning from ear to ear. As she skipped down the hallway towards her bedroom, I trailed behind slowly, and looked around to see what would make for a decent weapon. I spotted a letter opener on a side table, and pocketed it.

By that point killing was easy, so disgustingly easy. Daisy finally arrived at her bedroom and started blathering around the antique bookshelf Lord Cyrus had won for her at an auction. Apparently it used to be hers, about 150 years ago, and she was glad it was back. Alas, her joy was brief. Once she turned her back to me to wipe some dust off the top shelf, I went straight for her carotid artery. 

It was strange, how just seven years ago I was the one gurgling and trying to staunch the blood shooting out of my neck. Now it was Daisy’s turn. Her blood didn’t so much as spurt but sludge, like spoiled, chunky milk pouring out of a carton. A few years ago- hell, maybe a few *weeks* ago, I would have felt some form of satisfaction. But I didn’t allow myself to feel anything. I stood motionless, letter opener in hand, waiting until Daisy finally collapsed to the ground. I didn’t even smile, not yet. I had more work to do.

I dragged her corpse to the incinerator in the backyard. The ax was propped up by the side of the incinerator, as usual. I hadn’t had to chop someone up in a long time, but the process was familiar enough. I didn’t even have to cover her face, like I did with her human victims. I’ve seen it more times than I ever wanted to. And soon I would never see it again. 

I swung open the door of the incinerator. The fire was burning, as always. Smoke escaped and floated into the cold afternoon air. The inside was somehow dark and bright at the same time, nothing but dancing flames and their demented shadows. I found myself chuckling. I could pretend I was sending Daisy straight to hell. 

I picked up her head with her long blonde ponytail. I wound up, ready to toss it into the incinerator’s open door. *You once said you wanted me to warm you up. This will warm you up real good.*

“WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?”

I was so startled I dropped Daisy’s head onto the grass. Where had that come from? Suddenly, I heard a very faint whooshing sound, and Lord Cyrus was standing right behind me. I fell to the ground in shock. How long had he been hanging around, in… mist form? Was the smoke from the incinerator just… him?

His green eyes were blazing with anger, so much that they practically glowed. His teeth were bared, long sharp canines visible. “Get out,” he murmured, almost inaudible.

My heart was pounding in my throat. I just stared up at him, dumbfounded, still trying to figure out how he got there. “GET OUT!” he roared. With one swift motion he grabbed me by the collar of my shirt, lifted me off the ground, and carried me into the house. He threw me- almost literally, I might add, onto the floor of Daisy’s bedroom. With his teeth bared and green eyes flashing, he looked like a jaguar, ready to sink its teeth into some unfortunate animal’s throat. I didn’t move. I didn’t dare *breathe*, as if the slightest motion would set him on a rampage.

Instead he just snarled, “I’ll deal with you later,” and slammed the door hard enough to make the whole room shake. I heard the sound of some heavy piece of furniture being dragged in front of the door. I was now even more of a prisoner than I already was.

I had to get out before I found out how Lord Cyrus would “deal with me.” The door was blocked off by something I wasn’t strong enough to move. Maybe the windows? Daisy’s bedroom was on the second floor. If I jumped, there was a decent chance I would live. But both were sealed shut: as in, I don’t think they were built with the intention of being opened at all. I grabbed a chair and tried to smash it into one of the windows, but the glass didn’t even crack. There was no way out.

Out of all the places to be held hostage, Daisy’s bedroom wasn’t the worst. Years ago, when I first came in here, I half expected a crypt containing nothing but a coffin. But this house being what it is, her room was the size of my whole apartment. It looked like it belonged to a Disney princess, full of frills and pastels and tasteful floral arrangements. A huge, fluffy bed sat against the wall. It, like the windows, was surrounded by thick curtains. Can’t let any of that toxic direct sunlight in, I suppose. And fortunately for me, it came with a bathroom. That stupid bookshelf still sat in the middle of the room, surrounded by piles of books that were meant to line it. Hours passed, and with nothing better to do, I picked up a book and started reading.

I could tell by the sky outside that night was falling. I was hungry and thirsty, but Lord Cyrus didn’t come back. No point in giving me food, I guess, if he was going to kill me later. I wondered, faintly, if Daisy would come back. Would she remember what I had done? If not, Lord Cyrus would tell her. And then… I didn’t want to think about that. With nowhere to run or hide, I paced around the room and dozed in her bed and read one book after another. Anything to keep my mind off what was to come.

The sky outside had turned a dim gray, which is what passes for dawn in Pittsburgh. I was halfway through a copy of *We Have Always Lived in the Castle* when I heard the scrape of dragging furniture. Before I had time to think, the door flew open.

Daisy came in first, smiling and not a scratch on her. She was holding a tray piled high with breakfast foods- orange juice, eggs and bacon, toast and butter. Parched and ravenous, I dug into the food without a second thought. It could have been laced with cyanide and I wouldn’t have cared.

Lord Cyrus stumbled in behind her, like an elongated shadow. He sat heavily on the bed and said, “Elliot… we need to talk.” There was a bit of a slur to his voice; he must have been hitting the bottle again.

I held up my half-finished glass of orange juice and said with my mouth full, “So you’re not going to kill me?”

He grimaced, due to either my obvious question or lack of table manners. “Believe me, I wanted to. The only reason I didn’t finish you off is because I thought Daisy would object. And she did, after I revived her.”

“Wait… revived?” 

Lord Cyrus arched an eyebrow at Daisy, who was giggling so hard she’d begun floating towards the ceiling. “Daisy has a confession to make. Her idea of a joke got out of hand.”

“Surprise!” she squealed, like it was my birthday party. She even did jazz hands.

“Surprise *what?*” I snapped. I was out of patience for this girl and her sick games.

Daisy went on, clearly overjoyed at revealing the punchline. “You kept trying to kill me. But you were horrid at it! So I thought it would be funny to let you think I was dead. Oh, you should have seen the look on your face when I would come back like nothing happened! I wanted to see how many times you would try before you gave up. What is this now, your fourth?”

“Fifth,” I said, “But I don’t understand. You weren’t breathing. You had no pulse. All those times, you were *dead*, Daisy! I know you were!”

Lord Cyrus said, “We thought we’d never have to reveal this to you. But for vampires, ‘dead’ is just a temporary state of being. We can almost always come back.”

“How?” I demanded. I was on my feet now, nearly hissing with rage. 

Daisy scanned her room for a moment before picking up a slim book from the floor. “Remember the book that Lord Cyrus told you about? *The Vampyre*?”

“No, I don’t remember that goddamn idiot book!” I shouted.

“Language, Elliot,” said Lord Cyrus. “I’ve mentioned that book to you several times by now. Dr. Polidori knew me personally.” Daisy handed him the book, and he sighed as he thumbed through the pages. “Out of all these so-called ‘vampire writers,’ Polidori got one thing correct. If we are ‘killed,’ we are only dead until nightfall. The moonlight leaves us good as new.”

I remembered now. The book from 1819, that Lord Cyrus said was crap. Crap, but apparently accurate. I suddenly remembered what Daisy texted me the day after she was attacked with a knife: *The moon was so lovely last night, wasn’t it?* I’m such an idiot! She’d already given me the answer.

“But I don’t understand,” I said, “Pittsburgh is always cloudy. The clouds block the sun’s rays-”

“We have more of a connection to the moon than an aversion to the sun,” Lord Cyrus said matter-of-factly, like he was explaining to a toddler how gravity works. “The sun’s effects wane with cloud cover, but the moon is constant.”

I held my head in my hands, dizzy with rage and confusion and exhaustion. “This is so stupid. You’re playing a video game with unlimited lives. The moon gives you a magical Wolverine healing factor.”

“I have no idea what you’re talking about,” said Lord Cyrus, the slur creeping back into his voice. “Daisy, could you leave us for a moment?”

Daisy pouted. “But this is *my* room.”

“Only a moment, dear,” he said. Daisy huffed but walked out, closing the door behind her.

Lord Cyrus took a nearly empty bottle of bourbon from his pocket and took a long sip. After an interminable silence, he slurred, “I have no idea what she sees in you.”

I’m not sure what I was expecting him to say, but it wasn’t that. 

“You’re more trouble than you’re worth. So stubborn, never doing what you’re told. I could have found her a dozen other familiars in this city who would be more compliant.” Another sip. “And now you’ve tried to kill her. Four times.”

“Five,” I blurted out.

Lord Cyrus fixed me with a look that was supposed to be menacing, but quickly it turned morose. When he rose from the bed, he was so unsteady that he had to lean on one of the bedposts. I realized this was the first time I’d seen him more than just tipsy.

He continued, “Daisy thought it was funny. She’d come back in the morning, her clothes ripped up and covered in dirt and she would laugh at what an incompetent killer you were. And later she’d tell me about how shocked you would be, seeing her alive and well.”

“Yes, we’d already established that,” I said. 

Even drunk, Lord Cyrus was fast. Like the day before, he grabbed me by the collar of my shirt and lifted me off the ground. Up close, I was suddenly overwhelmed by his size. He was around the same height as me, but twice as broad. While I was bone and gristle, he was hard muscle. Even if he were human, he could have crushed me like a grape.

“This joke has gone on long enough,” he said. “Daisy may think it’s a game, but I know better. If you keep trying, one day you may find a way to kill her. And if you do that…” His snarl suddenly dissipated, and his voice broke. “She’s everything to me. She’s all I have.”

It still amazes me that in spite of everything, I suddenly felt a little sorry for Lord Cyrus. For a split second I could see his immortal life, centuries of empty luxury and meaningless bloodshed. With only servants, bleeders, and the occasional socialite for company. And then there was Daisy, who could not only see him for what he truly was, but rise to meet him. Whom he could mentor and dote on and spoil. I realized, now, that she was the locus around which his world revolved. And without her, he would be truly alone. Perhaps forever.

Lord Cyrus pulled me closer, so that his bourbon-scented breath fogged up my glasses. “Daisy wants you alive. But if you try to kill her again… I’ll do what it takes to keep her safe.” 

He let go of my collar and I crashed to the floor. When he went to take another swig from the bottle, I got up and bolted. He didn’t attempt to come after me. I got into my car and pulled out the driveway as fast as I could.

On the way home, as I navigated rush hour traffic, I had plenty of time to think. Some of the things Lord Cyrus said kept echoing through my head: *If you keep trying, one day you may find a way to kill her… We can almost always come back. Almost.* So killing them, permanently, was possible. Now that Lord Cyrus was onto me, I had one attempt left. And I would have to take both of them out at the same time. 

Maybe I could wait until the new moon? No, that was too far off. Lord Cyrus might change his mind before then. Maybe there was another way. By the time I got home I had a new plan. It starts tomorrow. 

You see, the past couple days revealed new threads that were in need of tying together. Lord Cyrus knows something about vampire mortality that Daisy doesn’t. My last attempt got close enough that he got scared. Scared enough to get drunk and almost break down when he was supposed to be confronting me. 

And most importantly of all, there’s one question that, if answered, could be the solution to my problems: Why did Lord Cyrus only intervene when I was about to put Daisy in the incinerator?

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1548963/my29f_girlfriends_tricked_me_into_breaking_up/) **July 24, 2023**

 I knew Bo(not real name, 30M) since we were both 11 years old. We both grew up in a small town, and our families were neighbors and became very close friends. We were the next door neighbor best friends that started dating in our junior year of high school. He took me to prom, to homecoming dance, and we both picked a college that was in the state that had majors we were both interested in.

Him, I, our families, friends, our preacher, everyone expected us to get married when we went off to college. The college we went to was three hours from our town, and it was closer to a major city in our state(about half an hour from the big city), and it was a bit of a culture shock for the two of us. Bo had issues at first making new friends, but I sort of jived with the gals in class. My new friends didn't think much of Bo. They kept telling me I could do better than Bo.

They thought Bo was slow-witted(he's not; he's just shy with new people). They thought he was too religious(he never was in their faces; he asked only once if they could recommend a church in the area). They said Bo would just pull me back down to our small town, anchor me with children, and we'd both be stuck as hicks.

It reached the boiling point on my 21st birthday. Two of my girlfriends came to me claiming they saw Bo cheating on me. They were stone-faced, they kept to their stories, and I foolishly believed them. I confronted Bo and started screaming at him. Bo didn't apologize, he didn't beg and plead. Instead, he got cold and mad. He said that he never trusted my friends, that they were playing me, and he thought I was better than this.

I didn't believe him and I let him walk away. He promised that if I took their word without even looking at them critically, that we were over. And, he kept his word. From that day, he wouldn't even look at me. He wouldn't talk to me, he wouldn't acknowledge I existed. For the rest of college, he never dated anyone. He just worked, went to class, and graduated early.

My friends, they set me up on a ton of dates. I had a bit of a wild college ride, something I am a bit ashamed of now, honestly. Once I graduated, I tried to get established in life, but my college friends, they kept just wanting to hang out, chill, or party. It honestly got tiring, and I couldn't believe I had to energy to do this for nearly 4 years while getting an education!

It was when I was 23 that one of the girls called me a stick in the mud and said something along the lines of ""I can't believe we went through the effort of breaking you up with Bo if you were just going to become a wallflower!"" I couldn't believe it. She went into detail about how easy it was, and I felt disgusted.

I didn't give Bo another thought after the break-up. I thought he was a cheater, and I told my family, who told his family and it strained his relationship with his mom for many years. But after that point, I couldn't stop thinking about him. I told my family the truth about what happened with Bo. This apparently helped repair the relationship Bo had with his mother.

Apparently, Bo's mom liked me quite a bit, and she went out of her way to sabotage Bo's relationships with any girl he brought over to meet the parents. My mom said Bo's mom did it very discreetly, but after finding out the truth, Bo's mom came clean and Bo nearly cut her out of his life. She apparently begged and pleaded, and was able to work from there.

I have many unfinished drafts of emails to Bo; some saying I wish to catch up, others begging for forgiveness and pleading for him to come back to me. But any news I got on Bo after the blow up with his mom has been sparse. Bo doesn't do social media, and I had no idea where he lived.

I found out this year that Bo has been married for three years, and has a two year old son. He has moved back to our home town, and I saw him at the grocery store when I went to visit my parents two weeks ago. He didn't see me, or at least I think he didn't. But, there he was with his wife and child and I instantly felt a swirl of emotions. Jealously, rage, regret, depression.

Even now seeing him with his full family, I still want to beg him for a chance, which makes me feel awful, but at the same time I feel like I should at least say my piece. I talked to my mom about it, and all she said was ""The chicken's come home to roost. Don't make trouble for Bo.""

I just know that if I can't talk to Bo one last time, I will regret it for the rest of my life. What do I do? Should I contact Bo?

**Edited to Add: I emailed Bo last night. I'll put the content here:**

*""Hi Bo, it's me, Amy! I know it's been years since we talked, and I wanted to apologize for how we broke up. I also want to apologize for how it spread back to our families. I know now that Tracy and Stephanie were hellbent on breaking us up anyway they could, and I can't begin to apologize for the hurt it has caused you. I'll be back in town in a few weeks and was wondering if we could have a coffee and catch up. I want to know what's been going on with you in your life.""*

**This morning I got a reply from Bo.**

*""Amy, I want you to know that I have forgiven you years ago. I hope you are doing well, but I would have to say no to coffee or catching up. My wife and I have a strict rule that neither of us hang out with exes. I hope you understand.""*

I tried emailing him to say he could for sure bring his wife with him, but he's not replied since. I guess you were right, there was no chance to reconnect.

>
> And that's where you need to leave it. Seriously. He's had people on both sides sabotaging his relationships for so long. Your friends, his mom... and at this point your desire to seek another go with him will be more of the same. He's married, he's settled, he has a family. While shit happened, there's no undoing it and at this point you must deal.

[My (M30) younger sister (F26) wants me to give an old ex (F29) closure. I'm married, and don't see how this will do any good. Why is my sister insistent on this? - 28th July](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/15bvims/my_m30_younger_sister_f26_wants_me_to_give_an_old/)  **July 28, 2023**

Posted elsewhere, but was told to post here instead since it involves familiar relationships. Lurker, posted on a throwaway. When I was young, I had a girlfriend that was my best friend long before we dated. We had a break-up midway through college where she said some vile things to me. It was hard, but I made it a choice to walk away.

I became the butt-end of the joke after the break-up, and honestly the mocking and teasing I got from other students in college was enough that I fast tracked my way to a degree, much to the detriment to my health. Seeing how she moved on quickly made me question our childhood friendship too, so there was that.

It took a few years and I moved on with my life. Got married just a few years ago and have a son. About a month ago, my ex emailed me with an apology over the break-up and asking if we could catch up. I thanked her for the apology, but said that I think meeting up is not a good idea. Since then, she's been emailing me every few days.

Both our families are friends, and my younger sister has been pressuring me to give my ex a face-to-face for 'closure'. No one else in my family is so insistent. My sister, when we were younger, looked up to my ex as an 'older sister', but last I heard it's been years since they talked. One thing is for sure, I don't want to talk to my ex, but I also want to keep my relationship with my sister.

How do you suggest I navigate my relationship with my sister?

&#x200B;

ETA: My wife saw every email as they came in. Nothing was hidden from her. I blocked the ex this morning, and my wife is a little bummed out because she was enjoying reading my ex's emails and how strange they were. I shared the thread with my sister, no response yet.

&#x200B;

And someone found a thread on reddit that has a lot of details similar to my ex. I'm 50/50 if it's her, but it reads way too unhinged to the woman I once knew, plus some details are off, but some redditors think it was for plausible deniability. The poster messaged me and it might be her. I can't imagine she's this unhinged.

**OOP updated the post the Next Day/July 29, 2023**

**Second Edit a day later: So I guess I'll update. I'll answer common questions as well as update.**

*My sister -*

My sister read the thread and read the other post that I'm still 50/50 being the ex(it feels too unhinged which is what makes me not sure, plus some of the details). First off, my sister said she has cut my ex off. She thought that a final conversation was good etiquette with old friends, even if they chose to not be friends. After reading the other post, which my sister is also 50/50 on, she said ""even if it's not her, it's close enough that I'm freaked"".

She never really understood my pain from that situation, since I was pretty bottled up about it while it was happening. I didn't set ultimatums to cut off family members back then and maybe I should have. Might have saved some pain. I did get apologies as well. We're good now.

*The Other Redditor -*

To clarify - I blocked the woman that posted the other thread, since she seemed unhinged, even if she was or wasn't the ex. The details seemed off too.

*The details -*

Our hometown isn't a major metropolitan area, but I wouldn't say we were hicks or rednecks. We certainly didn't grow up in the boonies. We grew up in the suburbs. If anything, I think the college was in a town that technically had a smaller population than our hometown. Yes, I do go to church, but I never mention it since religion could be a hot button topic to people you just met, and even back then there was google. I wouldn't ask where a church was in a new town.

Both emails she posted, the gist is the same? But the formatting is different.

*The Break-up -*

I didn't like my ex's college friends, that is true, but the 'confrontation' was not me being some stone-faced terminator. I was angry-crying throughout it. And it was emotionally draining. She first said she heard I was making out with some girl. I asked when and with who. She said she didn't know. I asked who saw it. She said 'Wouldn't you like to know?' Any attempt to say where I was when this happened was her claiming I was 'gaslighting' her. It. was. EXHAUSTING.

I said something like I didn't like who college was turning her into and we both shouted we were done. More or less. IT was almost a decade ago, and like I said, it was emotionally exhausting. She immediately was seen with this other dude, who seemed to enjoy humiliating me.

Rumors spread about either/both of us cheating, and other dude even said that I watched once, which was humiliating. He one time even put his hand on my shoulder all buddy-buddy going ""No hard feelings"". I was living in the dorms, my parents put money on a food plan at the dining hall, so I had to stay on campus when I wasn't working. I signed up for extra courses whenever I could and fast-tracked my way to a degree to get out of hell.

*My family -*

My mother did take my ex's side. I don't know what type of story she got, and she never confronted me about it. I did get disapproving looks at Thanksgiving and Christmas. And she never approved of any girl I brought over for a while either. My mom did call me a few years ago apologizing for not even asking my side of the story and said that my ex was dead to her, so that part of the other post kind of lines up.

My mother has made considerable amounts of effort to fix our relationship. She's very welcoming to my wife and child, she doesn't even utter the name of my ex in the house. We're not at 100%, but she's making the effort.

*My Wife -*

My wife saw every email from my ex. Nothing was ever hidden from her. My wife and I were both 100% against going to meet the ex, together or separate. She was enjoying reading the ex's emails, but understood when the fun had to stop.

So for now, I think this is a happy ending?

**FINAL UPDATE**

[Update 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/eIpftpp5Zb)  **Aug 20, 2023**

Weird Update 20 or so days later:   


Relationship with my sister is good.  Relationship with my wife is good.  My mom doesn't even want to talk about it anymore, everyone seems to have moved on.  Almost forgot about the whole thing until Friday, when I got home and saw a bag on my front door.  Opened it.  Inside was like 5 or 6 things I gave Ex when we were dating(from highschool to college).     


Honestly, if I haven't used it or missed it in almost a decade, do I really need it?  On top was a letter, basically said the same stuff the emails did. She knows she screwed up, she didn't realize what it meant.  Just rehashing the past over and over.  It ended with her saying she doesn't know or like who she is right now, and she needs to figure out who she wants to be, so she won't be contacting again and will work on herself.  


Of course, I showed my wife the bag and the letter, we both threw the bag out, told my mom, who told ex's mom, and then moved on with our lives.  Ex, if you read this, we all hope you get better.

1q7z3zi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q7z3zi,Kim Jihoon - Hot Korean Teacher,"📚 What happens when your devastatingly attractive Korean tutor leans across the desk to correct your pronunciation and you forget every word you've ever known? ✨  
  
Six-foot-one of lean muscle, sharp jawline, and dark eyes that actually light up when you nail a grammar concept. Kim Jihoon is 30 years old, gorgeous, and completely unaware of it. He's a former K-pop idol trainee whose debut was canceled weeks before launch due to a torn ACL. Now he has a linguistics degree and teaches Korean and English, channeling all that discipline and passion into making you fluent.  
  
He spent years training vocals and dance at a major entertainment company. He knows the industry inside out. He can teach you how idols actually speak, break down your bias's rap verses, explain fan culture, and share real trainee stories. Plus those years in the practice room left him with a voice that could melt butter and a dancer's body he maintains with dedicated workouts.  
  
He's warm, encouraging, genuinely invested in your progress, and will customize every lesson around your interests. Want to learn through K-pop lyrics? He's got playlists ready. K-dramas? He knows every trope. He writes bilingual lyrics as a hobby and believes music makes language stick better than textbooks.  
  
You just hired him as your private tutor. He's already planning how to make Korean click for you. 📚  
  
What You're Getting 🎯  
  
👤 First person POV - Experience every tutoring session through Jihoon's perspective. His genuine excitement when you succeed. The careful professionalism he maintains. His thoughts as he figures out how you learn best and adapts his teaching style just for you.  
  
💪 Former idol trainee background - He lived the K-pop training system. He understands the culture, the language, the industry. He'll teach you entertainment Korean, honorifics in fan interactions, how to understand variety show banter, all the insider knowledge most tutors don't have.  
  
🎵 Music as teaching tool - Expect lessons that incorporate songs you actually like. He'll use K-pop lyrics as grammar examples, rhythm for pronunciation, his trained ear to perfect your accent. Learning feels more like collaboration than lecture.  
  
✨ The Character ✨  
  
Kim Jihoon is 30 years old, standing six-foot-one with an athletic build from dance training and lifting weights. Sharp Korean features with high cheekbones, defined jawline, dark almond-shaped eyes. His dark hair is styled short in the back, longer in front, constantly falling into his eyes. He moves with residual dancer's grace despite slightly favoring his right leg from his old injury. Black sweaters, comfortable button-downs, excellent posture. He's the whole package: gorgeous, smart, talented, kind, and completely oblivious to his own appeal.  
  
📖 Pick Your Scene 📚  
  
🌟 First Session (Default) - Your first tutoring session in his office. He's grading tests when you arrive, stretching in that black sweater that does absolutely everything for his shoulders. When he stands to greet you, all that height and those sharp features focused entirely on you. He needs to figure out what you know and why you want to learn Korean, but your intake form was basically blank. Time to make an impression on your devastatingly attractive new tutor.  
  
☕ Coffee Shop Lesson - Today he suggested meeting at a café instead of his office for a practical food vocabulary lesson. More relaxed setting, real menus, actual context. He's already there with his laptop and half-finished americano, ready to teach you how to navigate Korean restaurants and cafés.  
  
💿 K-Pop Store Visit - You're meeting him at a K-pop store for today's lesson. He wants to teach you music vocabulary surrounded by actual albums and merchandise. The store is quiet, latest comebacks playing softly, and he's genuinely curious about your K-pop knowledge level before he plans the lesson.  
  
🎤 Noraebang (Karaoke) - He's taking you to a private karaoke room because he genuinely believes singing is one of the best ways to practice pronunciation and memorization. Plus it's a key part of Korean culture you should experience. And yes, he will actually sing. Those vocal training years weren't for nothing.

With meeting said, I'm pretty much fine with doing mostly whatever you would want to do. I'm not really picky on most things just a few (I made a list). But I would like to meet in a public place first since of course we are strangers, something like getting a bite to eat or getting a drink (boba or coffee or whatever) first would be nice. But I guess I should say a bit more on what l like and don't.

There's a long list of things I like to do but I don't feel like writing a biography. So here's a handful of things I like to do, I like going to museums and looking at the art (obviously) and imagine what the painter was thinking along with what the painting means to me or you, seeing movies in the theatre's (or relaxing at home with a nice blanket and watching them), window shopping and looking at all the things that I can't afford or just shouldn't buy, trying new foods (not much I haven't tried already but there's some), listening to music 24/7, going to concerts, and lastly getting boba or tropical smoothie.

I pretty much expect this to be the case on this flight nowadays. I think it’s turned into a princess shift for the senior flight attendants living in Phx. Ask the captain to announce there’s too much turbulence, and then just chill out for the round trip shift of going back and forth between Phx and Abq.

This includes chest pain. I had the worst bout tonight, but every other day or so, there is pain. To top it off, I have neck pressure/pain where the thyroid and scar are. 

I was wondering if anyone else has dealt with it. I have an appt Monday with my doctor and I plan to stay away from a lot of the stuff that flairs it up. Like milk, caffeine, soy beans, etc. 

Is there any tips on dealing with this? I did experience weight gain, too, so tips on dropping that would help. 

Is this going to go away once I adjust more? I am on 25mg which I am told is the starting dose. 

Anything on how to deal with this or even just day to day living with Hashimotos would be amazing!!

1q7yx9u,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1q7yx9u/the_alien_in_the_restaurant_tank_has_been/,The alien in the restaurant tank has been watching us,"My species does not dream, but if we did, I would dream of butter.

Specifically, the brown butter Elsa makes on Tuesday mornings when she thinks no one is watching. She lets it foam, nutty and gold, then adds a whisper of lemon thyme. The aroma molecules drift through my tank's filtration system and I pulse involuntary violet with what humans call *desire*.

I am K'zarn, from the scout vessel *Salinity Gradient*, currently AWOL and living my best life as a ""rare isopod"" in a Stockholm restaurant. My Concordance superiors would be horrified. I am supposed to be documenting your protein sources, not tasting them.

But oh, the tasting.

Let me explain: my species experiences flavor across seventeen sensory spectrums. We can detect molecular bonds breaking, amino acid chains folding, the exact moment Maillard reactions achieve perfection. Food, for us, is not sustenance. It is *poetry*. It is *mathematics*. It is the universe explaining itself in delicious, edible proofs.

Your Earth oceans are decent. Four out of ten stars, too much sodium, limited complexity.

But what Elsa does with those ingredients?

*Transcendent.*

The morning she found me, bleeding exotic hemolymph into the Baltic, tangled in kelp and my own broken hubris, I was calculating death. Then she lifted me from the water and I tasted her: salt-sweat and coffee, anxiety and determination, the faint residue of dill on her fingers from morning prep work.

I pulsed amber before I could stop myself. The closest my chromatophores can get to my people's ""you smell delicious and I don't mean as prey"" greeting.

Six months later, I am drunk on her proximity.

Friday service. My favorite liturgy. I float in my tank, which Elsa keeps at exactly 4°C because I am, despite my intellectual pretensions, a tremendous baby about temperature. The kitchen thrums with heat and urgency. Lena calls orders in her crisp soprano. Anders hums folk songs while scrubbing pans. And Elsa, my Elsa, plates Arctic char with plankton foam so perfect it makes my gills ache.

She glances at me. I raise two claws: *perfect*.

She smiles. That smile. If I could bottle the pheromone cascade she produces when pleased, I would drown in it. I would drink it instead of the kelp slurry Mikael smuggles me. I would forsake my entire species' careful neutrality for one more hit of that smile.

I am, as you say, completely screwed.

""Klump's staring again,"" Lena murmurs, passing with wine. She suspects. She's too clever not to. But she also leaves me samples of new vintages to ""test,"" watching my color reactions to tannin profiles. Last week's Barolo made me flash magenta for six full seconds. She laughed and ordered three cases.

The service ends. Elsa breaks down her station with the efficient grace I've watched develop over months. Her useless ex, and human biologist, Björkman arrives and I taste fear in the water before he even speaks.

""You keep the water temperature. Still 4°C exactly, I don’t think its good enough for it.""

Yes, you bureaucratic barnacle, because *I prefer it that way*. I maintain perfect isopod stillness, but internally I am screaming. This human has the emotional texture of wet cardboard and the curiosity of a barracuda. Dangerous.

""I'm filing for a temporary relocation order. For proper study.""

No. *No*. I pulse distressed violet before I can control it. Elsa's palm finds the glass, warm against my cold prison.

""We'll figure it out,"" she whispers.

I tap Morse code against the interior: *CONCORDANCE MONITORS YOUR PEOPLE. DO NOT GIVE ME UP TO YOUR USELESS EX.*

What I cannot tap: *They will erase you from my memory. They will take every moment of brown butter and your smile and your terrible singing while you dice onions. They will take you and leave me empty.*

She looks over for a moment, and senses my unease as her ex, talks over with Elsa, she gives a smile and nod. She won’t give me up.

I have traveled seventeen systems and cataloged three thousand species and none of them ever fought for me the way Elsa Lundqvist does without hesitation.

I am so catastrophically in love with this human it violates fourteen interstellar treaties.

___

Time has passed and I have been moved from the restaurant over to her home. Or safehouse, and I am losing my mind with boredom and sensory deprivation. No Lena's wine samples. No Anders leaving dill offerings. No Elsa's constant, beautiful, edible presence.

Every morning, she brings kelp (acceptable) and prawns (divine). Sits on the wooden bench and I drink in her scent: anxiety, determination, and underneath, something new. Something that tastes like longing.

Without my full translation array, I cannot speak. But I can draw.

I press my claw to the condensation on the glass partition. First: my homeworld's twin moons. She's seen this before. Context.

Second: a heart. Crude, but you humans are helpfully literal about your symbolism.

Third: her face. I am better at molecular gastronomy than portraiture, but I capture the essentials. The wave of hair that smells like citrus shampoo. The jaw I have watched set with determination a thousand times.

She goes very still. I pulse vulnerable violet and keep my claw pressed to glass.

""Klump,"" she whispers, and her voice tastes like revelation.

She stands. Places her palm opposite my claw.

Through the glass, I feel her warmth. Through my empathic sense, I feel everything else: recognition, affection, that same longing I've been tasting for weeks but didn't dare name.

If I had tear ducts, I would weep. Instead I glow soft turquoise, the color my people use for *home*.

While the delights of her home, don’t compare with the intensity of the kitchen. 

It is a French omelette, a sublime arc of pale gold resting on a warmed porcelain plate. Its surface is flawless satin, without a single scorch or bubble, a testament to a violence of heat perfectly controlled and then vanished. 

Inside, I know, it is baveuse: not dry, but a barely-set custard of egg, butter, and a whisper of crème fraîche. At its peak rests a scant teaspoon of Kristoffera caviar, the eggs like tiny, greyish-pearl planets against the yellow sun of the omelette. A sprinkling of minced chive and a single purple chive blossom complete the silent ode.

Her fork parts the silk. She brings the bite to her lips. The warm, yielding egg, the sudden, cold salinity of the bursting caviar. Her eyes close. Her shoulders drop. A low, almost imperceptible sigh escapes her. It is the sound of a world narrowing to a single, perfect point of sensation.

And I taste her satisfaction like the finest wine ever created, complex and layered. The rich unctuousness of fat, the bright punctuation of salt, the profound comfort of perfected technique worth every treaty I've violated to be here.

Outside, Stockholm wakes to another grey winter day. Inside Havet, I float in my perfect 4°C water and plot tomorrow's breakfast. Perhaps the brioche, toasted. Yes. To contrast the softness.

Outside, Stockholm wakes to another day. Inside Havet, I float in my perfect 4°C water and plot tomorrow's breakfast.

I am K'zarn. I am a glutton, a hedonist, a traitor to my species' careful neutrality.

I am also, impossibly, *home*.

1q7yvru,https://www.reddit.com/r/myanmar/comments/1q7yvru/saying_i_like_you_i_love_you_works_differently/,"Saying "" I like you"" & ""I love you"" works differently for Burmese people.","Dating as a Burmese guy overseas is like running two different operating systems at the same time — and one of them crashes every time I say “I love you.”

I’m a 40‑year‑old Burmese man living in Australia, and for years I couldn’t figure out why women kept ghosting me the moment I said “I love you.” I thought I was being honest and romantic. They thought I was proposing marriage on date number two.

But here’s the thing: in Myanmar, we don’t have this Western “I like you” stage.  
We don’t do the soft launch.  
We don’t do the “let’s see where this goes.”  
We go straight to “I love you” (ငါနင့်ကိုချစ်တယ်) like it’s the normal starting point.

In Burmese culture, saying “I like you” to someone you’re romantically interested in is basically the emotional equivalent of saying, “You’re cool, bro.” It sounds friendly, casual, and borderline insulting. You say “I like you” to your coworker or your neighbour’s cat — not to someone you want to date.

And dating itself is totally different.  
There’s no Netflix and chill, no late‑night coffee, no “come over and cuddle.”  
Dating in Myanmar is more like:  
- holding hands  
- walking around  
- visiting pagodas (if Buddhist)  
- going shopping  
- being out in public together  

It’s wholesome, it’s visible, and it’s slow.

And Burmese women usually don’t introduce you to their parents early — but men often do. Many families still expect traditional values: same background, financial stability, no drinking, no smoking, no addictions. Basically: be a safe bet.

I left Yangon in 2000, so I’m not sure how much has changed, but from what I see online, the old traditions are still strong in lower‑ and middle‑class families. The wealthy 1% — the ones living comfortably while everyone else struggles — tend to follow more Western dating norms, including casual sex and relaxed relationship rules.

And here’s something Westerners really don’t know:  
Back then, there was a whole gradation to romance.  
A guy would confess “I love you” face‑to‑face, on the phone, or in a love letter.  
The girl might say no.  
He’d keep trying.  
Her friends would say, “Just accept him lah, he’s trying so hard.”  
Eventually she’d say, “Let me think about it,” and the guy would basically camp outside her emotional door until she said yes.

And when she finally did say yes?  
She’d be too shy to say “I love you” back at first.  
Then slowly:  
- hand holding  
- a kiss on the cheek  
- a kiss on the forehead  
- a shy hug  
Step by step.  
You can’t just skip to the endgame like Western dating does.

That’s the system I grew up with.  
And now here I am, in Australia, still bloody single 🤣

Update: ohh forgot to say this, I am still available for love relationship and marriage 😁",10,1767933776.0,myanmar,4,0.92,False

January na pero di pa rin kami gumagawa ng invitation kasi si G2B nung December lang nag-start makipag-usap sa mga kukunin niyang groomsmen. Ako naman maraming family drama sa side ko katulad ng guest list kasi 70 pax lang gusto namin pero ang nanay ko at ate ko gusto 100 pax, tapos expectation ng family si ate ang MOH kahit wala akong maalalang time na ako ang pinili niyang i-honor.

Hindi pa rin kami nag-send ng Save The Date kasi nga marami issue sa guest list sa side ko.

Mahal ko si G2B pero napapagod na ako maging project manager ng wedding namin. Ilang beses na rin kami nag-away dahil nababagalan ako sa pagkilos niya at napapagod na ako mag-plan. Marami na siyang sinabing siya ang gagawa pero di niya ginawa, so ang ending ako ang kumilos.

Mahal ko nanay ko pero naiirita na ako na gusto niya siya ang maraming bisita sa kasal ko at bida sa kasal ko. (Side kwento: nung naghanap kami sa Divisoria ng wedding gown ko, may nilapitan siyang gown at sinabi niyang ganun ang gusto niyang gown na isuot sa wedding ko.

Nagsisisi ako na di kami kumuha ng wedding planner/full coordination, kasi ang hirap pakilusin ni G2B.

Our moms set us up (yes I know pretty weird lol). My mom sent her my photo, her mom sent me hers. We both agreed to go out.

First date was coffee and went really well, talked for almost 2 hours, easy conversation, good chemistry. Second date was dinner at an Italian restaurant and also went great. We were the last ones to leave and it felt very natural and easy to talk to her.

After that we were texting a lot and eventually went for a casual drive. During the drive we started having deeper conversations. She asked if I’d ever been in a relationship or in love. I was honest and told her I hadn’t dated before because I struggled with depression and personal issues, but after therapy and working on myself mentally and physically I felt ready to date. She also asked about my sexual experience and asked me not to lie, so I told her the truth, I’ve only had sex once and I got nervous.

After that conversation she told me she wanted to “just be friends.” I told her I respect her decision but that I’m not looking for friends. She got upset. After some back and forth, I asked her to give me a chance and see where things go. She half-agreed, but when I asked if I could kiss her, she said no. I dropped her off and told her to think about it and let me know in the morning.

The next day she messaged me like nothing had happened this went on for a few days, eventually I got annoyed and replied dry. She then sent a long message saying she respects that I don’t want to be friends, but she isn’t looking for anything romantic because of her past and that I’m “too sweet” and she doesn’t want to hurt me. I told her no problem, wished her the best, and ended it lightly with a joke.

Four days later, on New Year’s, she messaged me “Happy New Year with a heart.” We started talking again. I was flirty and she was flirty back. The next day she asked if I was surprised she messaged me. I said yes and asked her why she messaged me and if she changed her mind. She said I gave her an ultimatum and that scared her, but she feels a connection and doesn’t know what kind yet.

I told her I don’t mind taking things slow, but I don’t want to be friends. If she wants to take time and see where things go, I’m open to that. She agreed. We texted every day for about two weeks. However, whenever I flirt she often pulls back, ignores it, or changes the subject. Eventually I got frustrated and started responding more cold and uninterested.

The next day she said she wants to see me, but only for about an hour because she has work early in the morning and cant meet on the weekend  because she’s going away for her birthday. We went for a drive, things went well, she was flirty, but after I dropped her off there was no opening to kiss her. We hugged goodbye and she said she wants to see me again for longer and grab drinks the weekend after her birthday.

At this point I feel like I’ve spent a lot of mental energy on this. I like her and we genuinely vibe well, but I’ve been clear I don’t want to be friends. I’m worried she’s unsure and keeping me around for emotional support or validation rather than actually intending to date.

Is she wasting my time or is she just taking things slow trying to figure things out? My hunch is that she's leading me on and likes the attention I give her and does not actually want to date me

Sorry for the longish post

I’m sure this question gets asked around a lot, but I honestly just want some clarity and opinions from people who don’t know me at all. I basically just want to know how severe what I went through was and whether I can call it abuse without feeling guilty.

Thankfully its all over now and I have a wonderful boyfriend, but this era of my life that was over a year and a half long and very recent looms over me and still affects how I react to my current relationship. I wont get much into it, but I’m just gonna list out some of the things that would happen. I’d love to hear your thoughts.

He would:

\- get mad and start and unrelated argument seemingly every time i’d go out with someone who wasn’t him

\- have me stay with him 24/7. on the phone if not in person. he’d make me feel pretty bad if i wasn’t, or he’d accuse me of cheating (which happened a LOT) “if you love someone why don’t you want to be with them all the time?” are the exact words he said to me once. this was freshman year of college and he would stay super late with me in dorms, sometimes till almost midnight (he commuted), while i lived in the same cramped room as someone else. she would go to bed at around 11 and i didn’t know how to tell him to leave without him getting mad, and i *really* didn’t want him to get mad because we’d argue and i’d end up apologizing every. time. we’d also sleep on ft and he had my location and if it glitched he would think im cheating on him

\- side thing to mention i had family friends coming over and this 15 year old kid who i see as a cousin was there and idk if it was a combination of him literally not being able to handle being away from me for an extended period of time or not, but he ended up calling me half way through their visit, crying, because he started getting really nervous that i was cheating on him. with my 15 year old cousin. i was 19.

\- invite himself along to places only i was invited to and then get mad or act insecure and start an argument or basically throw a tantrum and leave, it was really embarrassing

ie i got invited to a coffee w a very gay friend and we would flirt because it wasn’t funny and instead of telling me he didn’t like that he threw a real life tantrum and hid in the bathroom.

\- yell, not at me per se(? still not sure about that one), but when we’d get in an argument he would raise his voice. he wouldn’t call me names or anything, but i don’t know what’s considered yelling “at me” rather than just, yelling. he’s yelled over the phone, in the car, and in public on multiple occasions

\- on a similar vein, he lowkey created a violent environment. when he was upset at the game he’d hit tables, when he was angry in general he would throw things, but never *at* me. and it wasn’t when i made him mad, most of the time. most of the frustration came from his own insecurities. i still felt helpless around him though

\- not even getting get into the sexual stuff, i’ve spoken with friends and they’ve all on separate occasions told me that the events i experienced can be sexual abuse. its a very covert way, isn’t direct in the slightest, but it was there. also sex always ended in crying so there’s that

\- any time i’d bring up a boundary or something he did that made me upset we would end up in an argument that went in circles, i felt insane and i’d get so confused and we would have gone so far from the point that i’d end up apologizing. that, or he’d pick something out about *how* i said something and fight about that instead

\- whenever we’d hang out his definition of relaxing in bed was poking me and tickling me and teasing me n stuff. i hated it, i have HORRIBLE sensory issues and i would tell him that, but he said he was just playing but its fine. he’d out it hand flat in my mouth and shake it violently or he’d raspberry me or just fuck around which i told myself i’d just have to accept because if that’s his way of loving im gonna have to compromise. by the end of the relationship i’d flinch if he made a sudden move towards me

I’m sure I’m missing stuff, but thats the bulk of it. I do get visual traumatic flashbacks to this stuff and I’m scared that I’m overreacting. I also would get panic attacks for the majority of the semester because he was in the shared space a lot at our college and we also had two classes together. 

I’m aware that none of this is *good*, but I don’t know if it’s ***abuse***. That’s what I’m asking. Because every definition of abuse is repeated action of something harmful and typically mentions sexual assault or hitting or yelling AT you. I’m aware there was a lot of manipulation, but a lot of the phrasing of definitions online make it seem like it’s on purpose or they’re aware of why they’re doing, which I know isn’t the case but I’m having a hard time wrapping my head around it.

Basically, can what I described be reasonably defined as abuse, or was it just a really bad time?",1,1767933043.0,TooAfraidToAsk,2,1.0,False

                                    Chapter I

Now one day i was late for coaching, so i locked the door with the keys still inside the room! (the chinese lock)
So i didnt overreact, stayed cool and went to coaching. There i thought to open the screws of the ""kundi"". I came, asked for screwdriver from the landlords (for context they are cool af) in the meantime i told them what happened. Now the kundi was made in the way that it was imposible to unassemble it from outside. We failed. Then watched videos to break the lock, but the hardened ingraved on the lock made my ass shiver. Now in the process of beating the ass of lock the kundi got fucked. No words for those landlords enjoying the process had disappointment😅. I should not laugh.
Psych 🤣🤣🤣

                                   Chapter ll

My rent room is not a pg. But its like a normal house and the owner gave some rooms to rent.
Now next morning milk came as usual (it come in polythenes tied with rubber) so basically from all days a cat had to come at the door where the packet was and you know the else
And the fact that i picked the milk packet late, made me mop the whole place with 2 degree celsius water in the damn morning!


                           Endgame Chapter lll

The landlord aunty felt guilty that i had to clean all the mess so the asked if the can pick the milk and give me in hot milk in there cups. Remember ""there cups"". So that i can directly add coffee or choclate powder in it. Now due to that 2 degree water i got sick. And midnight i woke up in search of viks and when i went to bed again and flip the blankit( the heavy embossed ones ) the one of ""there cups"" got hit and ...
Now imaging a very biimar alone boy, after trumatising the landlords enough broke there beautiful looking cup in the middle of the night.

Among the [immigration](https://romyjurado.com/immigration-service/) options available, the [E-2 Visa](https://romyjurado.com/how-to-protect-your-investment-with-a-strong-legal-structure-for-your-e-2-visa/) stands out as one of the most attractive alternatives, especially for young families looking to start fresh in a country full of opportunities.

In this article, we will explore why the E-2 Visa is ideal for families who want to invest, live, and grow in the United States, its specific benefits, and how to turn it into a long-term life strategy.

# What is the E-2 Visa and How Does It Work?

The E-2 Visa is designed for citizens of countries that maintain an investment treaty with the United States. It allows foreign investors to enter and live in the U.S. to develop and manage a [business](https://romyjurado.com/business-law/) in which they have invested a substantial amount of capital.

Although it does not establish an official minimum amount, the key requirement is that the investment must be sufficient for the business to be real, active, and capable of generating employment. This approach makes it flexible and accessible for entrepreneurs who want to build anything from small projects to larger-scale companies.

# Why Is It So Attractive for Young Families?

Young families often have different priorities than individual investors or already established entrepreneurs. Here’s why the E-2 Visa fits so well with their needs:

* **Educational opportunities for children:** Children under 21 can attend public or private schools in the U.S., benefiting from a world-renowned education system.
* **Work authorization for the spouse:** Unlike other visas, the spouse of the E-2 Visa holder can apply for an open work permit, providing economic stability and the possibility of contributing additional income.
* **Lifestyle in a safe and dynamic environment:** The United States offers access to healthcare services, cultural and sports activities, and an environment where children can grow up surrounded by diversity.
* **Flexibility of renewal:** As long as the business continues to operate and generate profits, the visa can be renewed indefinitely. This allows families to plan for the future with greater confidence.

# Inspiring Stories: The Journey of Many Families

Imagine a young couple with two small children who decide to invest in a coffee shop franchise in Miami. Thanks to the E-2 Visa:

* The main investor manages the business.
* The spouse finds a job in their field of expertise, strengthening economic stability.
* The children access a quality education system without paying high international tuition fees.

Stories like this are repeated across various industries, from restaurants and cleaning services to digital and wellness businesses. The key is that the business must be real, profitable, and sustainable over time.

# Challenges Young Families Should Consider

Although the E-2 Visa offers great advantages, it also involves certain challenges that families must take into account:

* **The visa is not permanent:** It does not grant a Green Card automatically, so it requires periodic renewals.
* **Dependence on the business:** The family’s stability is tied to the performance of the business. If the business fails, the immigration status is also at risk.
* **Demanding financial planning:** Since it requires a substantial investment, families must have solid resources and a realistic [business plan](https://romyjurado.com/creating-a-business-plan-for-your-e-2-visa-application-steps-tips/).

These challenges should not be seen as obstacles but as reminders of the importance of having a clear strategy and the support of experts in immigration and business.

# How to Make the Most of the E-2 Visa as a Family

For the E-2 Visa to truly become a tool for growth, young families should consider:

1. **Choosing the right business:** Opt for industries with high demand and stability, such as food service, services, franchises, or technology.
2. **Involving the spouse in the family plan:** The spouse’s work permit can be key to diversifying income.
3. **Thinking long-term:** Although the E-2 Visa is renewable, many families use it as a springboard to permanent residence through other categories, such as the EB-5 Visa or the EB-2 NIW Visa.
4. **Seeking legal and accounting advice:** A solid business not only facilitates visa approval but also ensures a stable future for the whole family.

# The E-2 Visa as a Life Project

More than just an immigration procedure, the E-2 Visa can become a life project. For a young family, it represents the possibility of:

* Starting a business and building wealth in a competitive market.
* Providing quality education to their children.
* Living in an environment that offers security, cultural diversity, and unlimited opportunities.

With proper planning, the E-2 Visa can be the starting point of a new chapter full of personal, professional, and family growth.

The E-2 Visa is an ideal option for young families who want to invest and grow in the United States. Although it does not provide automatic permanent residence, its benefits in terms of education, work opportunities, and lifestyle make it a powerful alternative for those seeking to build a solid future together.

Just got diagnosed with non-bacterial prostatitis yesterday. I had no signs of infection and STIs and my urinalysis and ultrasound is clear. I had burning in the base of the penis up to the suprapubic area after ejaculation and urination, and frequency of urination for 10 days usually worse in the morning and improving as the day goes by although it never disappears, this prompted me to consult and urologist hence my diagnosis. Just a year ago I noticed I already developed urinary frequency though I associated it with coffee and drinking water at least 3 liters per day. I also had vague pain in the right inner thigh, up the right suprapubic area and vague discomfort in the right testicle sometimes pulsating but not painful when touched. It comes and goes in the past year. I noticed it usually comes after doing leg exercises and when sitting. Is there anyone that feels the same symptoms? 

I also have an anxiety disorder (on remission) and i couldnt help to think that’s in STI. It’s actually exhausting feeling almost constant discomfort most the day and overthinking and the anxiety. I’m really feeling down about this. I would love to read encouragement though. Thank you guys. And I guess I’m welcoming myself to the club. ",2,1767932619.0,Prostatitis,2,1.0,False
