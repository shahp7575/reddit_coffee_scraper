Though most of the time is, at best

Sometimes I smile for no reason

But I‚Äôm crying throughout all the rest

All hundred-percent isn‚Äôt so bad

Although 99, I‚Äôm depressed

What I‚Äôm trying to say,

Don‚Äôt hate every day

At least ‚Äòtil you start getting dressed 
//

At 2:21, I start moving

Forever-late-riser, that‚Äôs me

By the time I realize it‚Äôs the a.m.,

It‚Äôs already 2:23

Due to the slight interruption

Of your heart‚Äôs impression on mine

Instead of the office

I spend every morning

Regretting deep-burgundy wine
//

Start to head down at 2:30

Not yet regretting my life

2 minutes later, there‚Äôs coffee

To my guitar by 2:35

It‚Äôs starting to feel quite revolving

Each new dawn‚Äôs merry-go-round

Love looked when I called it

The earth then was solid

But it now recedes back in the ground
//

I should at least try to start writing

If words will become my career

Tonight, I should work on my timing

And which chord changes most please the ear 

By fortune, I found a brief flow state

And found inspiration once more

I wrote a few lines

When I next glanced the time

It was already 2:54
//

I next lift my head at 3:30

The hour I run out of ink

When familiar and soul-stealing worry

Creeps in as I walk to the sink

Like always, it‚Äôs courting her memory,

With brain-worms of rotting alone

Without strength to fight

The best move for the night

Is to crawl back in bed with my phone
//

I think I‚Äôve cooked up a solution

For keeping the sadness at bay

I‚Äôll tighten my grip on illusion

And wield that to keep madness away 

I won‚Äôt lay in bed all day, grieving

To avoid hidden sorrows that lurk

I‚Äôll sing, and I‚Äôll dance

But instead of my pants,

I‚Äôll wear my pajamas to work

Met this girl on a dating app. Hit off straight away, talking back to back for hours. Met her in a bar one night and she comes back to mine. Best night ever.. she leaves the next day like 3pm and returns unexpectedly at like 10pm the same night.. yet again great.

She goes away for 5 days to which we talk a lot. 5 hour phone calls n what not üôÑ 

She returns home and we catch up, I had worked a 11 hour shift this day and met her after work so headed back to mine.. 

She had an appointment the next day at 4pm and I had work at 4.30. she wakes at 8 and gets coffee from the shops . Comes home and we laze around in bed all day until I get up at like 2.30 to get ready and so does she. We go to get bus together which I was confused because I knew ahe was cutting it fine but could have left whenever she wanted but waited on me so we went. The bus never arrived and she was late for her appointment.  She got off the bus in tears and walked away from me pretty oddly .

She then gets quiet after this. Telling me she needed boundaries because she missed her appointment and that she has changed a lot of plans for meü´§

Two weeks pass and I've saw her a couple of times. Asked her if she wanted to go out one night but she wanted to come to mine as she had a stressful day arguing with parents etc.. 

I finally asked the question yesterday of what was up as it has never been the same since and this was the reply I got .

_----------------------------------

Hey, 

Yeah that‚Äôs totally understandable ..., I respect you for asking. I‚Äôm all for open communication but sometimes people aren‚Äôt in a place to hear it so I‚Äôm not always sure when or if to brings things up. 
I have thought about you probably wanting to know where you stand with me though. 
Like I said when we started speaking I wasn‚Äôt really looking for someone in Dundee when I downloaded that app. Not really looking for anything consistent right now. As you know I‚Äôve just started therapy and I‚Äôve got plans to be working up at my dads on and off throughout summer from the end of March. I live at home with my mum and that‚Äôs just not a position to start anything from y‚Äôknow? üòÇüôÉ

When we started speaking we had some good chats and I kinda pictured some cute dates or activities and yeah you talked about buying the underwear and it sounded exciting, but what seems to be on the cards is hanging out at your place. Obviously I spoke to you about that time when I ended up being late for therapy after being up and fresh at 8am üåù we spoke pretty intensively when I was up north and I spoke about how I need have food or I get aggy and when I waited for you that day I had therapy you were like ‚Äúoh at least I have time to get something to eat before work‚Äù I was like aye oh cool I‚Äôll just go fuck myself as I run for this appointment having not eaten anything and it‚Äôs 4pm üòÇü´§

I think the thing that made me pull back the most was when you made that remark about it taking 3 business days for me to cum ü§î now.. I understand you were probably just trying to be funny but .. it takes me 30 seconds so I don‚Äôt think I should be the one getting criticised here üåù
I think you‚Äôre just comfortable with me, very off the bat which I‚Äôm not criticising but you still have to be a bit considerate with your words y‚Äôknow üòå you‚Äôre lucky enough to have the chance to make me cum.. don‚Äôt complain about how long it takes, that should be my job üôÇ 

I think we are just at different places, or maybe we‚Äôre in the same place! But that‚Äôs just the ‚Äònot ready to take this further‚Äô place

I‚Äôm still so keen for some cheeky pints and to whip your ass at shithead and who knows ay, but yeah I just have to prioritise myself right now so sorry if I came in quite hot with lots of messages and then disappeared, I‚Äôm just a bit of a skatterbrain on a mission to better herself right now x

Not sure what to say but ye, sounds like she's completely not interested while holding me to a comment I made out of pure tounge and cheek and was more having a go at myself than giving her a hard time for it.. this is also the girl who was trying to send me to the shop to buy Viagra after drinking 12 hours and my man not working üò≠üòÇüòÇ 

I dunno where I stand either but yea. What y'all thinking about this. Do I entertain it or do I just call it a day

Let's call them Jon and Janet. We met them at a baby class when our kids were tiny babies. We didn't really know anyone else in the town we live in, and over the past 3.5 years they've become our closest friends. We see them almost every weekend and I'm godmother to their son.

Over the past few months their son has become increasingly aggressive/competitive with our daughter. If she does something he doesn't want her to do (like run faster than him) he will shove her quite hard. If she starts using or playing with something he wants, he will go and shove her off or try to yank the thing out of her hands.

Janet will intervene, but Jon is much more laid back. When we're out with just him, I usually end up having to ask my daughter to just give the toy to their son, or let him have a turn on whatever it is first, because otherwise the son will escalate into screaming/crying and he has hurt my daughter before. Because of this my daughter has come to me a few times and told me that she needs some quiet time away from her friend (while out together) and that her friend's behaviour is making her feel sad.

My husband and I agreed that something needed to be said, so I gave Janet a call (I know her better) and tried to raise the issue in as gentle a way as I could. I was feeling very anxious about it, and tried to frame it as roughhousing that was getting out of hand. I didn't want Janet to feel like we don't like her son, or them. We love them all, and love spending time with them, and I said this to her on the phone. But Janet seemed guarded and like she didn't really think there was much of a problem to solve. She told me that roughhousing was age-appropriate play and seemed surprised when I told her my daughter was never *this* rough with her friends. It was clear I wasnt communicating effectively, so I tried to make her see that this had gone beyond roughhousing and mentioned that my daughter had told me she was upset by what was happening. Janet said she would think if there was anything they could do.

Fast forward 2 weeks. The day before my birthday. We'd arranged to go for a picnic with Jon and Janet at a local farm / play place. We had seen Jon the previous weekend but not Janet. The day of, Janet and son turn up with no Jon. He'd decided to go off with another friend instead. Ok, no problem. Then it turned out Janet and son had already eaten. I had made extra picnic food for them, but we just ended up eating without them. Then, later on in the day, their son threw a rock at my daughter. Janet immediately scooped him up (him screaming) and walked off with him. We followed but she was walking so fast we couldn't keep up. We couldn't find them for half an hour, so I messaged her and we sat down to have birthday cake (cupcakes). Eventually they turned up, but again Janet refused our offer to share. I had bought 6 cupcakes - one for each of the people I thought was going to be there. We ended up just taking theirs home with us.

The next day - my actual birthday. Normally I wouldn't do anything at all for my birthday, but this was a big one (40). Jon sent a message but Janet said nothing, and I haven't heard anything from her for the past 6 days.

I can't help feeling like I royally Fd up by talking to Janet about the son. Either I shouldn't have said anything, or I should have waited til I could speak to her face to face, or I should have said it in a very different way. I did initially ask her if we could go for a coffee but she refused and asked for me to just call her instead. I don't feel happy about the phone call at all - not what I said, or how she responded. And now I feel like she's angry with me. Am I right to be worried? Should I raise it with her or leave her alone? I really struggle to make / keep friends (I'm neurodivergent, just starting on a diagnosis pathway) and we really do love them, so feeling like I might have caused a problem is sending me spiralling with anxiety.

Tl;dr: a friend's son was being rough and controlling with my daughter. I spoke to the mum about it and now I think she's angry with me. How do I repair the relationship?",1,1741938720.0,Parenting,2,0.67,False

I have to go. My health is bad and I have to go.  Sniff, sniff. I stink.  Been inside with the heater on since Wednesday night. My old bones ache this winter. Colder than last year I think.  Definitely need a shower first, I don't want to gross out the people at the clinic. Gonna have to be up close and personal with the nurses all up in my space as the kids say. Ha,ha. Do I have time for a cup of coffee and some peanut butter toast or do I have to do a fasting blood test today? I don't remember. The doctor said something about not eating after 8:30 p.m. so I assume it's a yes. 
Do I have my phone, wallet, and keys? Pat, Pat, pat. Yes, yes, and yes. Away I go. Oh, the sidewalk here is wet. I guess the man watering his roses and chatting with the neighbor isn't paying attention to the hose. I've got to walk carefully,  too much potential for a spill. Then where will I be? In the hospital that's what. I hate not being able to drive anymore. Got to walk down the street to the bus stop. I hate walking, but it's good for your health. Walk everywhere you can and you'll be in great shape and live a long life, my grandma always said. ‚ÄúExcuse me sir. Do you want to sit down? I can move.‚Äù Wait, what, I'm already on the bus?

When familiar and soul-stealing worry

Creeps in as I walk to the sink

With brain-worms of rotting alone

Without strength to fight

The best move for the night

Is to crawl back in bed with my phone

I think I‚Äôve cooked up a solution

For keeping the sadness at bay

I‚Äôll tighten my grip on illusion

And wield that to keep madness away 

I won‚Äôt lay in bed all day, grieving

To avoid hidden sorrows that lurk

I‚Äôll sing, and I‚Äôll dance

I‚Äôll wear my pajamas to work

Hey MaximizeMe Crew! üåü

Ever feel like you're running on a hamster wheel and still getting nowhere fast? **Yeah, that was me last month.** I was juggling my job, personal life, and not-so-effective productivity habits until I realized‚Ä¶ there's gotta be a better way, right?

Let me share a little secret: *Combining daily rituals with time blocking was a game-changer.* Who knew?

Here's how it went down:

1. **Start with the Rituals:** 
   - Every morning, I kick off with a cup of coffee, a dash of gratitude journaling, and a 10-minute meditation sesh‚Äîjust enough to center myself before the chaos begins. Who else lives for that coffee smell? ‚òï 

2. **Time Blocking Input Mode:** 
   - I blocked out 9-11 AM as my ""deep work"" zone. Phone on do-not-disturb, noise-cancelling headphones, and laser focus on ONE project. Result? More progress in 2 hours than an entire scattered afternoon. You can't be mad at that, right?

3. **Break It Up with Micro-Rituals:** 
   - Midday dance break anyone? üé∂ü§∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Or maybe a 5-min walk? Breaking up the long hours with short bursts of activity got me to stay energized and shake off any brain fog. 

4. **Dedicate 'Creative Chaos' Time Blocks:** 
   - This is a new one for me. From 3-4 PM, all creative ideas, random inspiration, and problem-solving go here. It's like a brainstorm sesh with no rules, and it's honestly where my best ideas come to life. 

5. **Wind Down with Evening Rituals:**
   - At 8 PM, I switch gears to a wind-down routine: dim lights, chamomile tea, and disconnecting from screens. Talk about bliss.

What I noticed? **10 hours saved per week**, y'all! It's like I found extra hours hiding in my calendar that I didn't know existed. Imagine all the possibilities‚ÄîNetflix catch-ups, hobby dives, or just pure chill time. üòå

1. Unakki Clean Wahsed (Rossette) with the Origami brewer + Wave filter
2. Ratnagiri Inoculated Washed (Rossette) with the V60 & basic V60 paper
3. Blue Tokai Seethargundu with the V60 & basic V60 paper
4. Pitch Blend by Blacklist Roasters with the French Press
5. Vin Van Gogh by Bloom with the Flatground brewer + Wave filter

The confusion I have: I rarely end up liking the coffee when I tweak my grinder settings from 8.5 (1zpresso K Ultra) to something else (for Pour Overs only). I have gone further till 9, 9.2 & also lower till 7.5 (because someone at Nerlu, BLR told me they use it at 7.5 for Pour Overs. Also, the few times I have gotten great cups with an 8.3 or a 9, I have found it hard to replicate the same taste. I like sweet, fruity, low acidity coffees generally. Doubts/confusions I have:

1. Am I being too rigid with ""what I like"" and doing something wrong? 
2. How can the same / similar grind settings work for different light / light-med coffees? Or is this normal? (shall research this on my own too)
3. What should I be tweaking to get a sweeter cup with the same coffee?
4. Should I consider drastically different tweaks- water change, temperature, method

I know coffee brewing is subjective (we all having watched & loved the whimsical video by Hoffman on this too), but I‚Äôd love to hear perspectives on why my experience might be this way.

  
*For reference, my water temp is typically around 90-94¬∞C, and my pour style is usually 5 pulses- 50g every 30s, 16-18g to 250g cup, continuous circular pours, so I‚Äôm mainly questioning the grind size factor. But, please feel free to respond on these as well.*

No matter what I accomplished, it was never enough for her. I could be captain of the school team, but I wasn‚Äôt kind enough to my friends. I topped my class, but I needed to work harder. College, a PhD, a job, a house, nothing brought affection or approval from her. While I saw my friends being dotted on by their mothers as if they found the solution for world peace. 

It got worse over the years. I remember once, in front of everyone, she slapped me hard just because I said something that didn‚Äôt sit right with her. That moment stayed with me, it felt like all my worth was crushed in an instant. I used to joke, knocking on her chest saying I found the stone (in place of her heart) but she‚Äôd just push me away, never understanding that all I wanted was for her to see me, to love me, to even just hug me.

I‚Äôve carried this pain into adulthood, self-hate, bitterness, and a bottomless pit that never seems to find it's fill of emotional vulnerability. Even now, when I see a woman being kind, like pouring coffee gently, my heart breaks, because it reminds me of everything I never had. It‚Äôs reflected in my relationships too, the need for safe space , the bdsm intensities, but nothing has ever been able to fill that space.

Does anyone else still long for a mother‚Äôs love, even as an adult? I sometimes wish I could find someone to replace her entirely, but I know it‚Äôs just a fantasy. How do you process this need for nurturing and care that you didn‚Äôt get? I‚Äôm really struggling with this.

We're both in our mid 30s with a disabled 3 y/o.

It's been tough ever since it started to get tough.

After knowing each other since high school, we reconnected during the 2020 lock downs. Everything was wonderful. Fast forward to later that year and we're getting married at the courthouse over Christmas break. 6 months later we're expecting. Go through everything as usual, regular check ups, extra curricular sonograms, it was still all wonderful. Scheduled cesarean because the kid was, as the Dr. put it, ""folded up like a lawn chair."" Then, 2 months before our child arrived, her mother and only family passed away. It was difficult to say the least. But, as the due date grew closer, our excitement was more than enough to, temporarily at least, outweigh the bereavement.

Not more than a week into parenthood the PPD sets in heavy. Since then I've been doing everything I possibly can to make things easy for her. And she has her psychiatrist and therapist. A few months into parenthood she starts getting dizzy spells. One night after we both fell asleep on the couch during a movie she wakes up and takes a fall, jolting me out my sleep in the process, finding her unconscious opposite the coffee table. She's diagnosed with POTS and has had chronic migraines ever since. Some nearly a week long. A few months later, my father and who I only later in life came to realize was truly my closest friend, also passed away. I leave work and we float on our savings, hoping for the tide to turn. When our kid turned 1 we got their autism diagnosis. Nonverbal but they're making progress. And amazing, regardless. At this point, 3 years in and my wife being laid-up so frequently, I've inevitably bonded with them to the point that my wife say's she doesn't even feel like their mother. And now, we're constantly skating by, financially. It's terrifying, really, but I hold it together. 

That was until the past few days. I've found myself getting uncharacteristically and easily irritated. This morning I snapped at our toddler and yelled at them to be quiet, followed by immediate shame. My wife rushed in from our bedroom and I quickly removed myself from the situation. Later, when my wife pointed out that what I did was wrong, I snapped at her, too. Something about how what she said was obvious and that so much of her already limited availability is willfully given away, in the context that after her therapy session this morning she spent the entire day shut in our bedroom. She's more than upset about everything, and gets on the phone with her therapist. I remove myself again to lay down in the bedroom. When our toddler came tugging at my feet, I realized my wife had shut herself in the bathroom. I knocked to check on her because she still has those dizzy spells. She responds. While back to my everyday activities of chasing the kid around, I can still faintly hear her on the phone as I pass by the door from moment to moment. So I know she's conscious, at least. Some time later she comes out and right as we begin to speak I hear a knock on the door. In my confusion, she looks out the window and says not to answer. After talking to her therapist she ended up on a suicide hotline. Then, after a hasty hang up, they call it in. I tell her they're going to need to see you and you need to tell them you're OK if you are. While she's getting dressed, I made the effort to meet the officers at the front door to say my wife would be right down and I leave them on the porch. I go back to the den to be with the tot. A few minutes later, somehow she's let them into our living room and has divulged way too much information for them to leave. And here I am just thinking, again, that somehow this tragedy is for the better.

I am a divorced man, 30 yo, and I usually take my religion very seriously. I go to different suhbas, take durus, pray even tahajjud daily hamdulillah. The one thing that I have not and cannot get under control is my lust, so far I didn't fall for major sins but each passing day makes it harder since I work in public service, am approachable and get to talk often. Non Muslim women tend to share flirty glances or even directly invite me for a 'cup of coffee' from time to time. I avoid all of that by still staying Mr Nice Guy and playing innocent not catching the intentions. 

I hate it that marriage and wedding is bound to such high finances because I don't pay attention to money and have enough income to live alone, have a decent flat and doing okay but in my country standards I count to those who are of low income. I even asked my friends for help to find me a girl to get to know to since I tend to fall for the wrong ones. The older you get the smaller gets the dating pool. 

I know that fasting should help but for me it does the opposite. Don't get me wrong I am not addicted to corn but usually I relieve myself, do ghusl and keep going like usual. But during Ramadan especially this Ramadan I've had straight every single night after Ishaa and after suhoor (so twice a night) very triggering dreams. Of course as my fitra is and since I know how it is I miss the togetherness but how comes that fasting makes it so difficult not to fail so badly. Ramadan is for me my weakest month where I even cannot maintain proper tahajjud.

No. But I at least had a period for awhile before this where I felt okay to start the day! But lately that has not been the case. Hm. 

Today I have therapy, I need to go get my prescription and‚Ä¶ I mean work, but that‚Äôs a given. 

I‚Äôve been thinking here and there about incorporating meat into my diet again. I don‚Äôt want to‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want to eat animals. I love animals. The idea of eating their flesh‚Ä¶? It makes me feel ill. But I wonder if I would feel better and have more energy if I did incorporate it back in to my diet? It‚Äôs just been so long not eating it. I will never eat anything from a pig, that‚Äôs just so deeply ingrained into me, I mean that started when I was about 9 or 10. 8? Idk. Primary school. But I‚Äôm thinking chicken and fish and maybe mince. Imagine how easy meal times would be if I could cook up some chicken breast and have it with a bunch of veggies? Or some savoury mince with veggies mixed in? Or idk‚Ä¶ fish? I‚Äôve never actually cooked fish before. Fish seems hard. I‚Äôd like to like tuna but the smell yucks me out so bad. I think I like salmon, or I don‚Äôt *dislike* it but again I don‚Äôt even know because I‚Äôve not really given it a chance as an adult. I didn‚Äôt go fully vegetarian until my early 20s or thereabouts. Maybe early to mid. I don‚Äôt really know. It‚Äôs hard to say because I‚Äôve flitted in and out of vegetarianism since I was a teenager and my relationship with meat as a food source started when I was in the single digits. I just wonder how it could help me *feel*, because so many people are vegetarian or vegan and feel amazing but I think it‚Äôs possibly had a different effect on me? But how would I know? And I can‚Äôt just test it out, I mean I can but it‚Äôs such a big thing for me to introduce back in that it freaks me the f out and it makes me feel flooded with guilt. 

I have my hair appointment tomorrow. My bus times align very poorly with my appointment so I‚Äôll be about 40 minutes early. I might go to a cafe and get a coffee or lunch and read. I think that would be good for me. I hope wherever I go has soup. I‚Äôve been crrrrraving some soup. I have ten thousand inspo photos for my hair so I need to narrow them down too. No matter what I know I will be disappointed so it doesn‚Äôt even really matter in the end but still. Sadly a haircut doesn‚Äôt transform your face, body and personality too. Anyway tomorrow afternoon I shall look 2% different and be $300+ poorer, can‚Äôt wait. 

Therapy was fine. Good, I think. No actually it was very good but not because I feel I got much out of it but because I opened up about ‚Äúsexual assault‚Äù‚Ä¶ a bit. I didn‚Äôt go all in but I said it‚Äôs something that over time I would like to work through and I gave her a general idea of things that have happened. She said it was serious and she used the r word. I felt like a little kid being told off for some reason. I don‚Äôt know why. I just felt so small. I felt stupid. I felt stupid because I didn‚Äôt realise what to call what has happened to me, by different people at different times. She said it‚Äôs no wonder I avoid getting intimate with men and letting them into my life. She knew I have had some things happen here and there in the past but I think we‚Äôll work to unravel all of it. It‚Äôs just even now I don‚Äôt consider the things that have happened to be that big of a deal? Or worth mentioning or thinking about? Like how can your own long term partner rape you? Like ‚Ä¶ ? And the other things idk, I wasn‚Äôt violently hurt or anything and I allowed myself to drink too much etc, yknow. Anyway. I don‚Äôt want to write about it now. Maybe tomorrow. Before that we talked about how I‚Äôm struggling to build better daily habits and be consistent. A very conversational type session where I offloaded and idk. I felt flat before and I felt worse after. I want Andy. 

I went to get my prescription :) It was a nice walk I guess. It didn‚Äôt make me feel better but oh well. 

I want to go on a spa holiday so badly. A solo trip maybe, or with a friend, and just somewhere I can afford to have a full on spa day every second day and just relax and read the other day. Does that not sound heavenly? I wonder where. I can‚Äôt do it obviously, or rather I can but I won‚Äôt, the next trip I take will be for Andy. But right now I‚Äôm just daydreaming about massages, facials, hair treatments, reflexology, mani/pedis, sound baths, flower & bubble baths, body scrubs, body wraps‚Ä¶. HEAVENNNNNNNN. Maybe instead I save up for the overpriced spa treatments here and have a spa day here in my city. I can just save up over a few months. Maybe finally have a birthday spa day! My birthday is forever away but if I wanna be pampered for hours then it‚Äôll take that long to save up. Hm. What would I want? I‚Äôd want a massage, I‚Äôd like a facial but my skins a bit sensitive but a facial massage would be amazing. Hair treatment. Manicure. Etc etc etc. Okay I shall do that! My birthday is on a Saturday this year. Maybe I do the spa things on the Friday and take an AL day so that I can be at mum and dads for the weekend? Hm. OR MAYYYYBBBBEEEEEEEE I have a small pamper day sooner. There‚Äôs a nice place who do lash lifts, facial massage, reflexology, scalp massage, neck and shoulder massage‚Ä¶ maybe I book that in for sooner. Hm. Hm hm hmmmm. 

M and I made dinner together :) It was really nice. I feel really full now. I like having friends.

The brain is a distributed system, no single neuron has the big picture. Without going into metaphysics, we can observe two constraints it has to obey:

1. Learning from past experience - we have to consolidate information across time by learning from past experiences. Each new experience extends our knowledge gradually. If we don't centralize experience, we can't survive.

2. Serial action bottleneck - we have to act serially, we can't for example walk left and right at the same time, or brew coffee before grinding the beans. The body and environment impose strict causal limits on our actions.

The first constraint centralizes experiences into a semantic space. The second constraint imposes a time arrow, forcing distributed activity to result in a serial stream of actions. But centralization on experience and behavior does not mean having an actual center, it is still a distributed process.

*Conclusion*

So consciousness is like *semantic space with time*. And these two constraints explain the apparent unity of consciousness. They also explain why we can't simply introspect into our distributed brain activity - the brain works hard to hide it. Thus endless debates about the explanatory gap.",3,1741935370.0,consciousness,4,1.0,False

A year ago, I was in a really dark place. The cost of living kept climbing, my paycheck stayed the same, and I found myself doing mental math at the grocery store ‚Äî picking the cheapest options, putting things back on the shelf. I felt‚Ä¶ stuck.

I scoured the internet for ways to make extra money. Surveys, freelance gigs, dropshipping ‚Äî you name it, I tried it. Most either took forever to pay out or felt like a complete waste of time. I was exhausted and honestly embarrassed.

Then, I stumbled across something called promo conversion. I‚Äôd never heard of it before, but it‚Äôs basically a way to turn the bonus bets and bonuses sportsbooks give you into real, withdrawable cash ‚Äî without gambling. It‚Äôs all about using math to cover every outcome, so you lock in a profit no matter what happens.

I found this site called ProfitDuel that made it so simple. They walk you through everything step by step, and their calculators do all the hard work for you. I started small ‚Äî $20 here, $50 there ‚Äî and by the end of my first month, I‚Äôd made $800. By month two, $1,200. It felt surreal.

But honestly, the biggest win wasn‚Äôt the money ‚Äî it was the relief. Being able to pay bills without anxiety. Treating myself to a coffee without guilt. Actually saving money for the first time in years.

I know the ""make money online"" space is full of scams, so I was skeptical too. But this worked for me. If you're struggling or just want a legit side hustle, promo conversion might be worth looking into.

Day 1 - flight into Belfast City Airport from Gatwick arrived around 1:30pm. Coffee and lunch at the airport then taxi round to the Titanic Experience for 3pm timed slot. We found it incredibly moving and, as pointed out here I think, it‚Äôs worth noting it‚Äôs not a museum of artefacts. It‚Äôs more of an immersive storytelling experience. Not enough time to visit SS Nomadic or stroll around the area which we would‚Äôve liked.  We booked 3 nights at Tara Lodge on Cromwell Road and stayed in one of the annexe rooms just next door. Lovely room and breakfast was included. Plenty of options and highly recommend the pancakes! There‚Äôs no restaurant or bar on site but plenty of food/takeaway/restaurant/bar options close by.
 
Day 2 - Strolled down to Queens University and visited Ulster Museum. Planned on doing a lot more but actually loved the museum and spent most of the afternoon there. From there we got on the Belfast Hop On/Off Bus. This was great for getting our bearings around the city and was a real eye opener particularly around the peace wall and the murals. There was a guide on the bus and he was talking about the troubles and pointing out places where things had happened. We found that incredibly moving and unexpected on what we thought was just a get on/get off bus. 

Day 3 - Coach day trip to Giants Causeway with City Tours Belfast (discount code VB gets extra 20% off!) Stopped off en route at Carrickfergus Castle, stopped at The Hedges Hotel to wander down Bregagh Road (the Dark Hedges avenue), as we couldn‚Äôt go in to Carrickfergus Castle earlier we made an extra stop at Bushmills Distillery, then on to Dunluce Castle and then Giants Causeway. Utterly utterly stunning and breathtaking landscape. All places we stopped at were just incredible. If you do this coach trip and get Dave the guide/driver you‚Äôre in for a real treat! He was brilliant. 
 
Day 4 - Coach to Dublin. Coach was half the cost of the train and takes about the same time. Arrived in Dublin early afternoon. Visited the EPIC Museum and spent a long time here. The ground floor of the building is food and drink places and toilet facilities. The museum is downstairs. If you keep your receipt it gets you a free return visit within 10 days. We booked 3 nights at the Mespil Hotel which was fabulous. There‚Äôs a bar and lounge for food/drinks and evening meals. Breakfast is an optional extra. We found a little cafe just a couple of minutes up the road so went there for early morning coffee and pastries instead. 

Day 5 - Coach day trip to Newgrange with Mary Gibbons. Stopped off en route at the Hill of Tara then on to Knowth and Newgrange. Mary has a phenomenal wealth of knowledge of Irish history and she narrated through the whole trip! She hands over to other guides at Knowth and there‚Äôs a shuttle bus which takes you to/from Newgrange where another guide takes you into the tomb. Absolutely fabulous day trip and just incredible scenery.  

Day 6 - We had a stroll through St Stephen‚Äôs Green, up Grafton Street (handy shops for buying emergency socks and cheesy tourist gifts to take back home!) then got the Dublin Hop On/Off Bus. Again this is good for getting your bearings around the city. We visited Dublin Castle, Chester Beatty Library and Killmainham Jail. The Jail tour was absolutely brilliant. The tickets sell out fast and we initially couldn‚Äôt get any but if you check the site on the day you want to go and refresh around 9:15-9:30 more tickets come available so that‚Äôs how we got in. There‚Äôs a great cafe, shop and museum there too. 

Day 7 - Coach to Cork. Arrived early afternoon, strolled through the city centre to The River Lee hotel. It was raining so made the centre look a bit grey and uninspiring. We booked 2 nights in the hotel and have to say it was a bit of a let down despite its rave reviews. The food in the restaurant is fantastic though but note you will look out of place in casual clothes! The room we stayed in was a bit run down unfortunately. Maybe it‚Äôs different in the executive suites/rooms but our room was very tired looking and dreary. Half the plug sockets didn‚Äôt work, the air con/fan unit crackled even when it wasn‚Äôt on and you could hear everything that went on outside the room in the corridor. 

Day 8 - Coach day trip to Blarney Castle with Paddywagon Tours. We visited Blarney Castle and Gardens which was fantastic even though it was raining. Note on a rainy day it makes the castle steps very slippery as you climb up to the top. We also visited Blarney Woollen Mills store which is huge! Beware though you might get stuck in a queue of people who are having their purchases packaged up and shipped abroad! There were a lot of American tourists there doing that and unfortunately they have to meet a minimum of 350 euros so that means a lot of stuff per person so even a 2 person queue at the checkout can take some time. On the way back we visited Charles Fort, Kinsale (great fish and chips!) and Cobh. Had the weather been better we might‚Äôve enjoyed these stops a bit more!

Day 9 - Travel home day. We had a lazy morning packing our bags, had lunch at the hotel and got a taxi to Cork Airport for our flight back to Gatwick.

It was a bloody fantastic 9 days and we will be back for sure! Everyone we met and spoke to were incredibly helpful, friendly and lovely. I read lots of jam packed itineraries here while planning our trip and thought ours was a bit lame and slow but it turned out perfect for us. There was no mad rushing around trying to fit everything in and just skimming the surface of everything. So take your time guys and really absorb where you are, breathe it all in, don‚Äôt race through a tick list just for the social media photos. And plan for every kind of weather.

Over the past six years, the company has undergone significant leadership transitions and operational modernization. 



Between 2019 and 2024, revenue grew at a 5% CAGR, while PAT expanded at an 8.2% CAGR. This higher profit growth was not driven by margin expansion but rather better control over fixed costs - including Selling, General & Administrative (SG&A) expenses and Depreciation & Amortization. Over this period, fixed cost margins declined from 18% in 2019 to 15% in 2024, contributing to improved profitability.



As such ROE went from 26% in 2019 to 35 % in 2024. The impact of these improvements is evident in the Fundamental Mapper, where Hup Seng ranks as one of the better-performing businesses. However, its stock price has risen over the past year, and while it is currently below its past-year high, it still carries some investment risk.



The key question is whether the company can sustain its business improvements to justify a move into the Goldmine quadrant at its current valuation. Addressing variable costs and expanding margins could significantly enhance its positioning, making this a potential opportunity if executed effectively.

We are on our own journeys as coffee enthusiasts. All are unique.  I‚Äôm sharing mine.

First of all the current equipment:

1. Espresso machines - Gaggiuino modded GCP, and Cafelat Robot

2. Brew equipment- V60, Aeropress, Weber Bird, Pulsar 

3.  Grinders - KafaTek MC6, Zerno, K Ultra

Pretty early on in my coffee obsession- after a ton of research -  I had decided to spend most of my budget on grinders. 

To me, an espresso making machine is basically all about the rigorous management of water flow at fixed temperature and pressure through ground coffee.  This is simple but difficult to achieve.  However it can be done, and beyond a point (IMO only) the returns on investment decline dramatically.  

Grinders however are often overlooked and sometimes more nuanced (comparatively to the machines).

Hence, by implementing the Gaggiuino mod on my GCP and buying the Cafelat Robot I believe I achieved my main objectives:

 1. To make it my personal, individualised journey (since I spend a ton of time and sweat the mod, and the Cafelat is a brilliant manual machine not easily available here), 

2. To arrive at high quality espresso and 

3. To do this within a certain price range.

I think the Gaggiuino and the Cafelat do all of that that. Taste wise they‚Äôre as good as a Decent or LM.  But they‚Äôre nowhere as expensive (maybe 1/5th - 1/10th of the cost).

I won‚Äôt go into comparisons of espresso machines, single versus dual boilers, heat management systems, PID, time to startup, thermocouples versus boiler, yadda yadda.  Did all of that extensively to arrive at the three conclusions above

Now, grinders.  

I was willing to splurge here because I believed that this was a crucial differentiator (**once** you have purchased reasonably decent spro machines. Of course what‚Äôs decent is your call).  

I splurged on gtid wra but didn‚Äôt have an unlimited budget.  If I did I‚Äôd be looking at the Titus range or the Weber üëÄ.

Here my choice of grinders was looking for  best in class (IMO) equipment within my budget.  Hence the best conical (the KafaTek) and the best 64mm grinder (Zerno).

The Zerno has become my go to grinder for filter coffee.  I used the KafaTek for spro.

Which leads me to the brew equipment.  The V60, Bird and Pulsar are my current go tos.  The aeropress was once my favourite but these days it doesn‚Äôt get as much traction. 

I‚Äôve had most of this equipment for the better part of a year.  

Happy to answer any questions, if any.  

I must confess that yes this is a flex, but part of me wants to share this journey with fellow enthusiasts, and another part wants to advice or guide, assuming of course that you see value in it.

Oh yeah; the Agaro hand grinder and V60 were my trusty companions at the outset.  The Agaro I will never sell or give away because it‚Äôs an important milestone in my journey.

Just wanted to share a quick reminder about the risks of using public Wi-Fi and why using a VPN like **TurisVPN** is a good idea. Public networks are often unsecured, meaning that hackers and cybercriminals can easily intercept your internet traffic. Without a VPN, your data is at risk, and malicious actors could infect your device with viruses or malware.

Using a VPN encrypts your connection, making it much harder for anyone to spy on you or access your personal information. If you're frequently on public Wi-Fi, whether at coffee shops, airports, or libraries, **protect your device** by using a VPN like TurisVPN to ensure your privacy and security online.

Today I can quite easily get out of bed. I am off of meds. Even coffee is optional. I no longer suffer a crushing desire to obliterate my shamefulness. Though it is plain I am crippled as compared to those light souls I encounter in the store, at the library, see also at the gas station and so on and so forth, the feeling is overwhelmingly one of relief now.

Though I know it to be ridiculous, I am quite unable to understand it that I am not, in fact, being surveilled by some secret society. Why? Because I am honestly that special! Yes I know myself to be mad. And yes I am unable, much as before I could not step foot out of the warm blanket and onto the much too cold ground, now I Can Not believe that I am of no interest to the men who tell the people on the radio what to say to me. 

Even worse. It's gotten so bad that I quite believe myself to have magic powers. They are very subtle. Of course. I could not cause your spoon to bend by power of mind alone, thereby ruining your shirt as you try to eat your soup. Nor can a pull a bunny out of my hat. But I Can Not Belive, all the same, that I am not possessed of the the potential to perform such acts, if only I would train enough. And so I spend my son's college fund on tarot books instead of index funds. 

It helps me to go to church. Although I know I pay a high price for a little bit of solace, anything is better than being alone in this black mental mire. 

And in all this, I place in a separate tower the faith I place in God. That to me is no madness. Rather to not acknowledge God seems to me to be proof of the unsound mind. 

And then the question of just how much of my beliefs should be counted as ""outside"" influence? This concept alone is enough to send the brain spinning. Let alone to ponder whether or not I have been brainwashed. Or whether I have only watched too much TV. And then wouldn't it be that TV is nothing more than brainwashing. And on and on. 

Little wonder so many do reach and do remain in the collapse state. ",1,1741933479.0,CPTSD,3,1.0,False
1jaxgh6,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAllergies/comments/1jaxgh6/adult_onset_nut_allergy/,Adult Onset nut allergy,"Hey guys, I‚Äôm very new to this whole allergy thing and am feeling a bit sad and scared about it all right now, if it‚Äôs okay I‚Äôd just like a bit of space to vent and also ask some questions to anyone who‚Äôs had these allergies for a while.

So I‚Äôve never had a single allergic reaction to anything in my life, until a couple months ago I had a horrible reaction after eating peanut butter‚Äî hives, insane runny nose, coughing, scratchy throat. That one went away with Benadryl and an oatmeal bath, and I thought maybe it was just a fluke. Then I went to Panda Express for my work lunch break, and when I came back, started having a full blown anaphylactic reaction with all the previous symptoms, but also my ears and throat started to swell and I nearly passed out. Luckily my fianc√©e was nearby and able to pick me up to take me to Urgent Care where they gave me IV Steroids that helped and then gave me an epi pen to carry around. I won‚Äôt lie it was pretty scary and after that I wasn‚Äôt able to get allergy tested for another month, so I was hardly eating because I wasn‚Äôt sure what caused it or if any other new allergies had popped up.

Well, I finally got tested yesterday and turns out I randomly developed a severe allergy to pretty much every kind of nut except for cashews. Which is sad because a lot of my favorite meals and treats have nuts in them, and I have eaten them just fine my whole life up until now. I‚Äôve been trying to be silly about it and make jokes to stay positive but I really am sad and anxious about the whole thing. Snickers bars are my comfort foodüò≠

So here are some questions I have for veteran nut allergy havers:

- What are some safe snacks to eat? I really love chocolate bars and a lot of my favorites I can‚Äôt eat anymore. (The doc said to stay away from anything that has the label saying it was made in the same factory as peanuts or tree nuts)

- How do you make sure food is safe ingredients / cross contamination wise at restaurants?

- What are some dishes that have nuts that I might not expect? (I know you have to be pretty careful with peanut oil)

- How do cafes work? I loveeee getting a coffee and writing/ drawing at cafes but now I‚Äôm anxious about it bc of cross contamination from peanut butter smoothies or almond milk. Do you just ask them to clean everything? I feel bad making them do a bunch of extra work and what if they didn‚Äôt do it?

Also if you have any other advice not related to one of the questions I asked please let me know!!!!",2,1741933365.0,FoodAllergies,1,1.0,False
