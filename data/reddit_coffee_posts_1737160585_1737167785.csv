1i3x8z6,https://www.reddit.com/r/mokapot/comments/1i3x8z6/espresso_roast_vs_dripfilter_roast_again/,Espresso Roast vs. Drip/Filter Roast (Again!),"I am going to reopen this question which was discussed 8 months ago in the following thread:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/mokapot/comments/1czt2pm/espresso\_or\_filter\_roast/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mokapot/comments/1czt2pm/espresso_or_filter_roast/)

I previously thought, agreeing with some of the writers on that post, that there really is no ""espresso roast"" that is different than a ""filter roast."" With that assertion comes the idea that the roaster will state what their company thinks would work best for that particular bean but that is not a definite answer for everyone. What I have come across since that time is that some roasters will treat the same bean two different ways--one way for drip preparation and a different way for espresso. For example, the  Oregon roaster Coava states, on its website:

>We roast two development profiles; one is for¬†**espresso**¬†and the other is for¬†**drip**. Espresso is a unique brewing method that produces a concentrate and therefore needs a roast that tones down the acidity, allowing the full taste profile and balance of that coffee to shine and taste its best in an espresso format. We use the term 'drip' to categorize all other brewing methods that produce a dilution. This profile is great for anything from a home coffee pot to an AeroPress.¬†

Quote comes from: [https://coavacoffee.com/roasting](https://coavacoffee.com/roasting)

That company gives us the option for each of its varieties to choose espresso or drip. I see that another Oregon roaster, Great North Coffee, also gives that option for some or most of its varieties. Most roasters, however, do not say that they sell the same beans with a choice of roasting style. More often, they will simply designate a particular variety for espresso bean, or drip, or make no recommendations at all.

I know that some people feel that an espresso roast means that it is a darker roast. I don't think that is the case because sometimes a medium or even a lighter roast may be designated as an espresso bean by the roaster.

This topic came up because I bought a bag of a Nicaraguan coffee from Coava for use with my Brikka pots, and based on their instructions, I chose the drip option. Coava did not specify a roast level on its website but, by looking at the bean, I would think that it is either medium or medium-light. What I found was that the result was way too acidic for me. After many years of drinking exclusively dark roasts I have been wanting to get into medium and light roasts, after having some superb lighter espresso drinks at local cafes. Based on my experience with this Nicaraguan bean, I definitely plan to specify ""espresso"" next time I buy a medium or medium-light bean. I think that the Brikka (and probably also the Moka) concentrates the acidic taste of a bean that may already have at least moderate acidity.

I know that people often say it's best to stick with medium-dark to darker roasts with Moka and Brikka, but I'd like to see if I can make it work with lighter roasts too, and I want to hear what other people think about this topic.

‚ÄúGood afternoon Scarborough! Thank you so much for your time today. It‚Äôs wonderful that my colleague Zetix026 and I have the opportunity to speak with you, as there is much for us to share.

Scarborough stands as a region underserved by reliable rapid transit. We started with an aging elevated RT Line that metaphorically and literally went off the rails, but what is our plan for the future? The first is the Eglinton Crosstown LRT. That was certainly a disaster. 5 years off the original opening date, with no opening date in sight, we‚Äôre just staring at the unused tracks at our feet wondering what went wrong.

This line is expected to serve Scarborough, but the question of when it will enter service still remains. While Liberal MPs spent the last half-decade pointing fingers at the Ontario Provincial Government and transportation agency Metrolinx, for legal issues. Sadly, this is all they do. They point at the opposition or other governments for issues that have some connections to them. If they adopted a mindset to take initiative and recognize mistakes, then our country wouldn‚Äôt be in the crisis she is in now.

This means it‚Äôs time to look into the future. We have a project in front of us, one expected to bring options for people in Scarborough. We have seen the great, the not-so-good, and the downright terrible, It‚Äôs time to look at other countries‚Äô great infrastructure projects to recognize the steps we need to take.

Thankfully, much progress is already being made. Exactly one year ago, TBM(Tunnel Boring Machine) named Diggy Stardust was lowered underneath our feet to commence on the project. I have much hope for it, but with our incumbent Liberal Government, I can only hope as to how much they truly care about bringing this much needed option.

During the Speech from the Throne, the Prime Minister talked a lot about sustainability. This will present the perfect opportunity to make commutes sustainable, as it gives people options. Options like these allows for cars to get off the road, the **proper way to reduce emissions.**

This 2nd Parliament has quite a few interesting people to be part of this. Most of all, if nobody else comes out to assist and keep the project on the rails, my party and I will be here. If Mr. Trimble fails to hold a high standard, like he demonstrated today, stand out loud so all 16 Liberal-NDP MPs recognize that they can‚Äôt act like slugs in the House. We don‚Äôt need children who snuggle tight in the protection of walls in their homes to lead crucial projects like these. Scarborough, this is for you, for the People!

We‚Äôve been together for 5 months and most things have been going great. It‚Äôs a very mature and healthy relationship. Anytime we‚Äôve had an issue, we‚Äôve bought it up and can get on top of it pretty well. 

I‚Äôve since realised that I have anxiety due to past relationships and my childhood. I‚Äôve started going to therapy and trying to get on top of it. 

I‚Äôve told 28F all of this and she has been supportive, telling me to never doubt the way I feel. We speak about future holidays, moving in together (at the end of 2025 if things are progressing as well as they are). Always tells me she loves me and appreciates me, does cute little things like get my toothbrush ready for me in the morning. I‚Äôve met all her friends, I‚Äôm in the friend group, I‚Äôve even started going to gym or hanging out with her friends even when she‚Äôs not around. She drops me coffees at work, takes her lunch breaks to line up with mine and I know, sounds pretty smooth sailing hey. 

But moments when I‚Äôm by myself, it‚Äôs like I almost doubt that this is even possible. My mind says she doesn‚Äôt like me, I second guess every tiny little thing. Once the feeling passes me, Jesus I feel so stupid because it‚Äôs nothing but my mind making up a nothing scenario?? I‚Äôm not sure if therapy is really helping a wholeeeee lot, I‚Äôve still got a few more appointments to go so I won‚Äôt give up on that. 

I‚Äôve decided not to tell her everytime I get one of these feelings because I understand how fucking exhausting it would be because it‚Äôs starting to happen almost daily. Sometimes it‚Äôll last 20 mins but sometimes it last like 2 hours? Even if she‚Äôs fkn texting me saying nice things. It‚Äôs not even a feeling of her cheating either, it‚Äôs just like, I can‚Äôt believe that she likes me and wants to be with me???  I‚Äôve legit slept at her house most nights with a couple off here and there. 

How do I relax, switch my brain off and just fucking enjoy that I have met such a beautiful person?

My questions ‚Äì 
I would love a rug. There‚Äôs a couple of scuffs on the floor from the previous owner in front of the large couch that I would like to cover up. What size should I consider? How should I position it? What design suggestions do you have? 

Should I consider a coffee table? Is there room for one? Ideas for type of table? 

What suggestions do you have for wall art above the large couch? Ignore the white patches ‚Äì touch up paint coming soon! The third picture is something I found at target that I loved when I saw it in person, I‚Äôm just not sure if it would be too much brown? or if it would be too small?

Should I hang anything on the wall above my TV? Someday I might mount my TV, but for now I like it where it is. 

I‚Äôd say my style is earthy neutral. Browns/tans with splashes of sage green and rust orange. I love plants (real and artificial).

We‚Äôve been together for 5 months and most things have been going great. It‚Äôs a very mature and healthy relationship. Anytime we‚Äôve had an issue, we‚Äôve bought it up and can get on top of it pretty well. 

I‚Äôve since realised that I have anxiety due to past relationships and my childhood. I‚Äôve started going to therapy and trying to get on top of it. 

I‚Äôve told 28F all of this and she has been supportive, telling me to never doubt the way I feel. We speak about future holidays, moving in together (at the end of 2025 if things are progressing as well as they are). Always tells me she loves me and appreciates me, does cute little things like get my toothbrush ready for me in the morning. I‚Äôve met all her friends, I‚Äôm in the friend group, I‚Äôve even started going to gym or hanging out with her friends even when she‚Äôs not around. She drops me coffees at work, takes her lunch breaks to line up with mine and I know, sounds pretty smooth sailing hey. 

But moments when I‚Äôm by myself, it‚Äôs like I almost doubt that this is even possible. My mind says she doesn‚Äôt like me, I second guess every tiny little thing. Once the feeling passes me, Jesus I feel so stupid because it‚Äôs nothing but my mind making up a nothing scenario?? I‚Äôm not sure if therapy is really helping a wholeeeee lot, I‚Äôve still got a few more appointments to go so I won‚Äôt give up on that. 

I‚Äôve decided not to tell her everytime I get one of these feelings because I understand how fucking exhausting it would be because it‚Äôs starting to happen almost daily. Sometimes it‚Äôll last 20 mins but sometimes it last like 2 hours? Even if she‚Äôs fkn texting me saying nice things. It‚Äôs not even a feeling of her cheating either, it‚Äôs just like, I can‚Äôt believe that she likes me and wants to be with me??? 

How do I relax, switch my brain off and just fucking enjoy that I have met such a beautiful person? ",1,1737166134.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

2 months na ako unemployed since I was let go from my previous job as a dessert store crew right after Undas. Nakakahiya mang sabihing my probationary employment was discontinued due to falling short of standards, not sure if that would possible put me in sort of bad light to hurt my chances of being hired, even if I would try hiding it by saying I was laid off or planned to resign, I eventually became honest na lang and saying ginawa naman best ko. Moving on, I started job searching already by late November and landed 2 interviews by December. One is for an admin assistant role for a coffee shop based in Taytay, but was seen potential for their sales associate role sa mother company na pang-IT based in Ortigas, pero di natanggap. Then next is for a sales account executive role at a residence hotel sa Ortigas, met HR and sales director then waited 3 weeks, and after the holidays I unfortunately received a rejection email.

Moving on to this year, di ko exactly mabilang pero baka umabot na ng 100 or more na ung applications ko. While it seemed 2025 started on a good note, 2 interviews agad right after new year, until now wala pa ring balita sa application status ko at nakapag-follow-up na rin twice for both, so if I'm still ghosted I'll assume my applications unsuccessful. Ung una is a 4-star hotel sa Ortigas, supposedly for a guest service agent pero ending production staff under manufacturing ang inoffer after 2nd interview, though mas preferred as adviced na rin for F&B or pang-hotel. The other one is for a brand associate for food position sa isang malaking retail company sa BGC, 1 initial interview lang then if may suitable role daw for me ay bibigyan ng online exam, which until now wala pa rin.

Early this week, back-to-back interviews uli. First is for a Japanese concept restaurant group, applied for management trainee pero mas preferred nila may experience, second choice is kahit restaurant staff, ayun after 1 initial interview and a short math exam on their 1 day hiring process in Pasig, bigo ang ending. Then next is for a beverage shop company based in Taytay kung saan naroon ang head office, for an admin staff role though after initial interview I was suggested of a store audit role which I got interested in naman, binigyan ng pre-employment exam which I passed naman, so waiting na lang if may final interview ako with the general manager next week. I have medj high hopes for the auditor role, pero we'll see.

And this coming week, may interview uli ako on Monday, for restaurant staff sa isang salad shop based in Makati (I think merong branches sa Ortigas, not sure if I'll be considered there).

All the rest of my applications are pending pa. Mostly towards F&B since my 3 jobs amounting to over 2 years experience ay aligned sa F&B na mostly pang-entry level, pero open to any other role related sa hospitality since HRIM grad ako, or kahit anong admin/office type role I may be interested in. UP grad pa naman but it seems it's been overlooked or wala na ring masyadong bearing, so I would end up sa mga small opportunities which aren't bad for starters if experience ang hanap. I would start preparing soon for the March civil service exam, with trying to apply for government jobs if makapasa as a backup plan if ever matengga pa rin until later this year. And since I'm from Antipolo pa, I limit my job search in terms of location either within Rizal area or nearby NCR areas lang (Ortigas, Pasig, Makati, BGC, Cubao, Eastwood, basta within or near those areas lang), need to take into consideration ung commute and have no means of renting somewhere.

For those like me na still searching for a job, sana makahanap na tayo soon this 2025. Tiyaga lang!",2,1737166082.0,phcareers,0,0.75,False

1i3x289,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1i3x289/most_people_dont_realize_it/,Most people don't realize it...,"It began on a quiet, normal morning. I was in my kitchen, sipping coffee and scrolling through my phone, when suddenly the lights flickered and went out. At first, I didn‚Äôt think much of it‚Äîpower outages had happened before. I figured it‚Äôd be back in a few minutes. The coffee maker had stopped mid-brew, but I brushed it off, thinking I‚Äôd just wait it out and restart the machine a little later.

But then I checked my phone. No Wi-Fi. That was odd. I tried switching to data roaming, but there was no service either. Strange. I looked outside, and some of my neighbors were opening their doors or on their porches, glancing around to see what was happening. They were as confused as I was. I noticed several vehicles idled on the street, unsure what to do. The traffic lights were out. Still, I told myself it was all fine. It was normal for a power outage to happen, and the energy company would sort it out soon enough. 

I had to get to work, so I grabbed my keys and headed out to my car. I made my way to the gas station because I was low on fuel, and that's when I noticed a line of cars trying to get in. People were standing around the pumps, frustrated, some yelling at the clerk inside. It wasn‚Äôt just my house, the neighbors, or a few streets. Everything was out. Something bigger was going on.

By mid afternoon, I made my way back home,  as the apprehension around my neighborhood was palpable. The grocery store was packed with people clearing shelves out. Bread, water, canned goods‚Äîall were going fast. I managed to grab a few things myself‚Äîsome snacks, a pack of batteries, and spring water‚Äîbut the cashier warned me they couldn‚Äôt accept credit cards because their systems were down. Luckily, I had some cash on me.

The day went on, and the sun started setting. It was getting dark. The streets felt eerie as the usual glow of streetlamps, homes, and buildings were all black. No one was out. Just silence, broken only by the occasional car alarm, emergency siren, or helicopter in the distance. I lit a few candles to light my room‚Äîand for the first time, I felt scared, alone and without the warmth of technology‚Äîno way of knowing what was happening outside or why everything was down. Whatever was happening wasn‚Äôt normal, and it didn't seem like it was going to be over anytime soon.

The next morning, the water stopped running. I‚Äôd filled up the bathtub as well as a few containers the night before, but I expected the electricity to be back on by now. My phone was now out of battery and useless. Luckily, I found an emergency crank radio/flashlight combo I kept in a closet and tried to go through the local stations. It was the only access to outside information I could get. But the news wasn‚Äôt comforting. Apparently, the blackout was widespread with entire states in the dark. No one really knew why it happened, what caused it, or when the power would be restored.

By day three, the grocery stores were now empty and closed. Gas stations had ""do not enter signs."" And people outside were leaving and starting to panic. Some of my neighbors came over to ask if I needed help and whether I had any food I wanted to share. It was clear several of us didn't have enough to last longer than a few days. I could see the desperation in their eyes, which only made me more anxious for what was to come.

Rumors began going around‚Äîa cyberattack by China or North Korea. Maybe Iran. Others claimed it was a solar flare. The local radio stations I listened to offered no answers, only speculation. Some time later, I came across a station where a retired electrical engineer was discussing his theories. His voice was calm, but the words he spoke chilled me as I listened. 

He explained how the blackout was likely caused by an attack on the electric grid. Until that moment, I hadn‚Äôt given much thought about how electricity was made or worked. Like most people, I took it for granted. It was just electricity after all, how hard could it be? But as the man continued, I began to understand just how fragile our whole system really was.

He explained that at the heart of the U.S. electricity grid are these massive machines called high-voltage transformers. They are enormous devices‚Äîweighing hundreds of tons‚Äîand critical for moving electricity from power plants down to the cities and towns that use it. Without these critical transformers, power can‚Äôt flow downstream. 

He continued that the grid was like a spider‚Äôs web with intricate connections and sub-connections. If you take even a few key critical strands out, the whole system collapses. These huge transformers were irreplaceable in the short term. He described them as custom-built machines, often made in countries overseas, taking months and sometimes years to make. And that's when I knew it‚Äîthe power wouldn't be coming back on for a long while. I felt an unnerving knot tighten in my stomach.

Other channels on the radio were speculating about they heard, claiming it to be a terrorist attack. A drone attack, to be specific. Cheap, off-the-shelf commercial drones modified to carry small explosives, similar to the ones used in the Russia-Ukraine war. They said it was a small group of people in a similar style to 9/11‚Äîterrorists targeting key substations across the country. Not even that many, perhaps 20 or 30. They used GPS and publicly available maps, flying the drones low to avoid detection and hovering over critical infrastructure.

The explosives they were carrying ruptured the cooling systems that kept the transformers from overheating, and the oil inside leaked out and ignited, causing massive fires. Within minutes, the transformers were destroyed, and the grid started failing almost immediately. The attackers didn‚Äôt need a massive army or billions of dollars‚Äîjust a few drones, some explosives, and a plan. It was all terrifyingly simple.

By the end of the week, the city was still dark. No power, no water, and the food was running out. I was rationing what little I had left and imagining where I was going to get more food. No stores were open. I heard rumors that hospitals were overwhelmed and were shutting down as generators ran out of fuel. Patients were starting to die from treatable conditions, and without refrigeration, life-saving medications like insulin became useless. The elderly and the sick were likely dying by now, but it was only the beginning, and no one could do anything about it.

Night came again. The sound of gunshots echoed through the night‚Äîmostly in the distance but sometimes too close for comfort. People were clearly out there being robbed or shot, but no one could do anything about it. There were no police, national guard, or government authorities anywhere to be found. They simply never came. Most of them probably went home to protect their families, especially because without electricity and fuel their radios weren't working and there was no fuel to respond to emergencies. Everyone had to look after themselves now, and all I had with me was a couple of knives in my kitchen to protect me.

As the days went on, I began to run out of food and water. I was desperate and scared at what was to come. Would I have to steal food from the neighbor next door? Did they even have anything left? I didn't want to hurt anyone. I thought about it all night as my empty stomach growled and kept me awake. 

Morning came, and I decided to take the risk and walk to my friend's home a couple miles away. It was dangerous, but I had no choice. To my relief, he was still there and let me in, reluctantly offering me some dried nuts and fruit to ease my hunger. That night‚Äîas we sat near the window discussing our new reality, we heard the looting in the distance. It was the darkness and the night sky, and the noises we hoped wouldn't get any closer. 

I wondered if the government would come and save us. Surely, they would. No‚Äîthey couldn't even stop the attack, so how could they stop society from going up in flames? I recalled how the experts had warned us that the grid was vulnerable. Obviously, no one listened, because there we were, sitting in the dark as society went to shit. Maybe they thought such a thing couldn't happen because it never happened before in history. Yes‚Äîthat seems like typical bureaucratic thinking. To must, it probably made sense. Who thought hijackers would use commercial planes filled with people as missiles before 9/11? Not many‚Äîbecause who would be that crazy? I guess we always seem to underestimate how dangerous people can be when they come up with a plan and they have a worthy cause behind it.

--------------------------------------

It was not too long ago‚Äîmaybe 60 years‚Äîthat people lived without the marvels of modern technology. But today, we're all connected. All the infrastructure that provide the food, water, transportation, communication, etc, that keep us constantly fed and alive‚Äîthey all rely on a carefully balanced web of systems that are extremely vulnerable. If any of the key systems go down, it all comes crashing down together. So far, society has never experienced such a disaster. But not because it can't happen, but because there simply hasn't been enough time for something to go wrong.

Can it really be that simple? A few explosives strapped to a couple dozen drones hitting 20-30 critical substations? Yes! That‚Äôs all it would take to collapse the electric grid and bring our entire country to its knees. No trucks to deliver food, no electricity to pump clean water, no cell towers to communicate, and no government to enforce law and order.

At the moment, our electricity grid remains effectively unprotected from drones, major cyberattacks, and a whole host of other threats no one talks about. Never in history has simply staying alive been at the mercy of so many intricate and delicately balanced systems. If any foreign adversary or terrorists succeeded in attacking our grid‚Äîor even parts of it‚Äîit wouldn't just be the toilet paper that runs out but everything we take for granted. And there wouldn't be any warning.

How much food is currently in your refrigerator? How many snacks are in your pantry? How many mouths do you need to feed, and how long will that food last? If your faucets stopped running right now, do you have bottled water? What if there's suddenly a group of armed individuals breaking down your door but there's no cell service? What if the government never came to rescue you? What if you were all alone to fend for yourself‚Äîfor a month, for two, or eight?

We‚Äôre all living our lives, blissfully unaware of how fragile our world really is. The lights are on, the water is flowing, and the shelves are stocked‚Äîuntil one day, it simply isn't. And just like that, everyone is rushing to stores, panic-buying rolls of toilet paper and whatever is left in the canned tuna aisle.

No one is prepared. Not our federal government, state government, or local authorities. Everyone assumes it can't happen simply because it hasn't yet. But between a physical attack on Key Transformers, a generalized cyberattack on the Grid, or a natural event like a Solar Flare or EMP‚ÄîChatGPT weighed the probability of such a scenario occurring at 40% within the next 30 years. That's essentially a coin toss.

But after reading this, most of you will simply forget about these existential threats and continue on with your daily lives‚Äîeither because you think it's too hard to prepare‚Äîtoo expensive to prepare‚Äîor perhaps you're willing to take the risk. But in the end, there'll only be two kinds of people: those who were responsible enough to prepare and those who will be struggling to stay alive.",1,1737165873.0,stories,0,1.0,False

We knew each other like a decade ago, but we're never super close. Always friendly, but we'd never hung out in our own. He had been hitting on me for months and I never responded. I realized we had the same taste in books so we began talking. We planned a date to go see Nosferatu and get coffee on New Year's Day. New Years Eve, he completely ghosts. I understand because I'm sure he was busy with friends. The next day I ask him if we are still on for our plans. He took like 3 hours to respond. He finally responded and canceled because he was having ""existential dread"". Then I saw photos of him out having drinks with friends on New Years Day after he canceled on me. It seemed like he was making an excuse not to hang out with me, so deleted his number and stopped speaking to him. A week later, he texted me apologizing. He said he was just nervous for our date. He said that the way I reacted to him canceling was ""cold"".  (I basically just said""got it, good luck"" because it was such a weird reason to cancel.) I ended up forgiving him and we talked all week. Our new date was planned for last Tuesday.  On Monday, he started ghosting again. Little to no responses. He was posting on Instagram all day, so I knew he was on his phone. I texted him and said, ""hey, this feels kind of like I'm getting ghosted. I'm not sure if you're ready/want to go on the date, so I'm gonna bow out."" He was incredibly offended by this. He said I was ""making assumptions"" and it ""wasn't cool."" I just thought he was doing the same thing as last time and ghosting before the date! I apologized and said I totally misunderstood. He stopped talking to me, but proceeded to stalk my Instagram stories. He was also posting like, angry songs on his. I messaged him and apologized AGAIN. He said ""we can never be friends or communicate ever again"". I said, ""I think he level of vitriol is disproportionate to what I did. I am sorry. I don't want to be in bad terms."" He proceeded to tell me again that he essentially hates me and we will never be friends. Meanwhile he's stalking my every move on social media. I've since deleted him on everything, but like...

1i3wt3a,https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarfree/comments/1i3wt3a/is_this_sweet_even_worth_it_usually_no/,Is this sweet even worth it? Usually no,"Been casually sugarfree on and off for a year or two now. The ""don't break the chain"" method + the Easyway method are pretty effective for me, but I have to learn to say no because I usually break my streak when I am out with friends or at a party.

What I always try to note, though, is whether the offending sweet was ""worth it"" in my mind. If I genuinely enjoy it, then maybe it is justified, right? So I keep a mental tally of if I actually enjoyed a sweet, and try to note if it is actually good or more about the act of treating myself (this is the case pretty often). Maybe I will actually log it this year but hopefully I won't have any future entries to write down.

And sometimes it actually is worth it to me--maybe 10% of the time, or 20% as I'm getting more mindful--but I've realized that most of the sweets I eat just taste mediocre or straight up crap, especially as I avoid sugar more and more. Most candy, all store-bought baked goods, a lot of soda, a lot of ice cream...sure, I could say ""this tastes good but my health feels better"" but I don't even have to do that most of the time. It really surprised me. 

I do genuinely enjoy occasional coffee drinks, a rare bubble tea, homemade baked goods etc. but even with these, I usually get diminishing returns fast and end up finishing them just because they are there (big area for improvement there). I also am way more aware of how gross I feel physically after having any significant amount.

We've been talking on snapchat for a couple months, and we are eachothers #1 best friend on snapchat (which means we've been talking to each other the most on snapchat for over 2 weeks)

We talk about God, relationships, share memes, and talk about our past experiences in dating. After some weeks of talking, she invited me to her house and I met her step mom and we hung out for an hour or so.

She left for a trip to visit her biological family in another state, and when she got back, she asked if I wanted to go on a casual date. 

We went to get coffee at the library for a couple hours and had a good time! After the date she texted me that she liked spending time with me.

Ever since that date, she hasnt been as talkative over text, taking 20+ hours to respond for the past 4 days.

I appreciate that she asked me out for a casual date, which signals that she's interested in me to an extent, but I'm not sure if she is just being a woman and dealing with emotions and needing alone time, or if there's another guy in the picture and she doesn't want to lead me on?

She did say that she wants to keep things casual, which I agreed with her on that. She seems like a girl worth pursuing, and i want to date her officially, but she doesn't seem super eager ever since our first date.

I believe i haven't done anything to be too pushy or over eager, but we've made a lot of progress in the courting stage, I kind of want to lay my cards on the table and tell her how I feel, but I don't want to seem like I'm trying to lock her down ASAP.

She has an anxiety disorder and she can be pretty awkward sometimes. She has had 3 relationships in the past, but those 3 relationships were not God centered. She's fairly newer to the Bible than I am, but she's learning a lot, she's involved in a church and she wants to better herself.

Maybe I'm just being impatient, but I absolutely don't like waiting on someone, and I don't want to catch feelings too fast, only for her to not feel the same. It's risky, love is scary, and maybe she feels the same way when it comes to her anxiety. 

Potentially she has some kind of anxious attachment style. I'm aware I shouldn't idolize her, I just want more from her without seeming desperate.

TLDR: A christan girl I've hung out with twice, is suddenly being distant, and not as talkative over text, should I reveal my feelings for her, or am I being too over eager for a relationship. The silence is killing me to say the least.",1,1737164985.0,Christianity,2,1.0,False

Horno - Blumentritt St; classic pansit batil patung. Consistent na timpla. Lahat ng bisita dinala ko dito, never napahiya.

Kaffee - Magallanes‚Äô best ho/e; they may not have the best parking spots but defo the best coffee shop in tugue. Did I mention they serve cocktails too?

Miki ni Nam - New kid on the block. Miki inspired by the downstream Cagayan recipe. Okay naman, pag sawa ka na magpansit. They‚Äôre in front of the new Double dose branch along Legaspi St.

Mumbai Masala - Aguinaldo St corner Mabini St; I would say the best Indian restaurant in Tugue? Not that ive tried every single one of them. But ‚Äî this place has generous servings & authentic flavors. If gusto mo magpabebe, perfect here. paubos mo yung biryani rice sa ka-date mo.

Happy Shawarma - inside Alibabag food park (Gonzaga St); Good luck finding it though! (Hint: Look for the Pop Stop mini mart.) There‚Äôs also a taco shop beside it called Hambre Taqueria. Okay din!

RJP Computer Center - beside Ermita church; compshop sa umaga, ihawan sa hapon. Literal na hole in the wall. I have no pics because last time I went here, piso pa ang isang stick ng isaw.

Before I say anything else, I want to apologize for my last post‚Äôs sudden conclusion, as well as its incompleteness.

Assuming everything went according to plan, last Sunday should have been a quick, five-minute pit stop. If my ancient laptop really started acting up, maybe closer to a ten-minute break from my erratic movements. The odds of me being ambushed in that deserted truck stop appeared comfortably low, so immortalizing the mining logs on the internet felt like a worthwhile risk.

As I pulled off the highway, I told myself that if I got to the fifteen-minute mark without a successful upload, I would call the attempt a wash and try again another day. No matter the outcome, it should have been a brief excursion.

Removing the key from the ignition, my engine‚Äôs crackling growl faded away, leaving only the silence of the vacated lot. I methodically scanned my surroundings for threats, but found none. There were a handful of LED lamp fixtures scattered throughout the area that caught my attention as they flickered on and off, randomly spitting out globs of yellow light that matched the color of the full moon's hazy glow overhead. Otherwise, all was still.

Cautiously satisfied, I grabbed my open laptop from the passenger seat. In my head, I repeated a new mantra, trying to keep myself grounded:

*Hijack Wi-Fi from the closed Starbucks, share the logs, and then return to the interstate.*

It wasn‚Äôt a complicated plan, and yet it still went awry. Five days later, I‚Äôm still not entirely sure how I missed the vehicle approaching. Some combination of sleep exhaustion and mental fatigue dampening my senses? Probably. Alternatively, maybe the God Thread swimming through my flesh obscured her arrival? Can‚Äôt rule it out.

When I finally noticed that car creeping up behind mine, my stomach dropped through my gut like a goddamn anvil. Every muscle fiber I have contracted, as if increased tension would actually safeguard my brain and heart from whatever flavor of violence I was about to be baptized with.

Knowing I might never get another chance, I typed a fragmented sentence, clicked the post button, and then slammed the laptop shut. Pivoting my torso to face the vehicle, I couldn‚Äôt determine who was in the driver‚Äôs seat. The car idled ominously, blinding me with its headlights.

I wondered if my life was over, and how that meant I‚Äôd never get the opportunity to say my goodbyes to Camila. That painful moment felt infinite. Cocooned inside rays of harsh light, boundless fear stretched and contorted each passing second into an entire eon of perceived time. Decades came and went as I braced myself for the gentle thump of a silenced bullet gliding through me, the promise of a hundred tomorrowless days written on my ruptured chest in blood.

Finally, my vision went black, but not on death‚Äôs account.

A car door softly clicked open as the headlights dimmed, and someone emerged. While I waited for my night vision to readjust, they were just a human smudge standing motionless outside a compact sedan.

*‚ÄúJack‚Ä¶is that you?‚Äù*

Recognizing the voice instantly, I practically threw myself out of the car, rabid with hope.

*‚ÄúCamila! Where have you been? Are you hurt?‚Äù*

Initially, I felt waves of relief wash over me. When my pupils adjusted, I saw Camila. Blue-white eyes like arctic waters meeting my own. Wispy blonde curls rising over her collarbones like golden smoke. She looked flesh and blood, upright and intact - this was my wife, I thought. She was wearing¬†*her*¬†clothes, driving¬†*her*¬†car. Seeing her so full and complete inspired a sort of amnestic lovesickness in me. I had missed Camila so much, who she was before all of this, and here that version of her stood. Inundated by a sea of endorphins, I became drunk enough to forget.

As I embraced her, however, she spoke again.

*‚ÄúOf course I‚Äôm okay! Why wouldn‚Äôt I be? Why did you want to meet here, anyway? Are you ready to go home?‚Äù*

The waves of relief soured like rotting meat, and I came crashing back to reality.

With my lovesickness now erased, other, nastier things found purchase in the vacuum that it left behind. Camila‚Äôs deflation. Maggie revealing that my wife was on loan to me from some organization related to my grandmother‚Äôs business. Her transformation. God Thread. The mining logs. The description of a young man‚Äôs bones torn from his body by threads of sentiment metal.

A living alloy, capable of changing shape at will.

I pushed her away, and she fell backward on to the ground.

*‚ÄúCamila‚Ä¶tell me where you‚Äôve been.‚Äù*¬†I said, standing over her.

She genuinely looked confused and hurt by my actions. It stung seeing her in pain, but her fall caused me to notice something important from my vantage point, the collar of her T-Shirt creasing to reveal the top of her sternum.

The woman had no port.

No scar or bandage to indicate it had been removed, either. There was nothing but blemishless skin on the front of her chest.

This wasn‚Äôt¬†*my*¬†Camila.

*‚ÄúJesus, what‚Äôs gotten in to you?‚Äù*

She stood up, brushing some small grains of asphalt off her jeans. After a pause, she moved one foot toward me, which caused me to move several steps back in response. Seemingly exasperated, she tried appealing to me.

*‚ÄúAlright, Jack, I‚Äôll answer your question. Just...just settle, I guess. Well‚Ä¶I was sick today. Had a nerve flare, posted myself up on the couch. You called Maggie to see if she could help, which apparently she could, because I'm feeling better now, and uhh‚Ä¶well, you called and told me to meet you here a little after 10PM.‚Äù*

Her brow furrowed with confusion as she gave me an explanation of the events that led up to this moment, like she was realizing in real time that something about her memory was wrong. Tainted by something out of her control.

Like the fact that some parts were completely fictional, and the parts that were true occurred almost two weeks ago, not a few hours ago.

*‚ÄúWait, no‚Ä¶actually, you didn‚Äôt tell me that. You asked Maggie to pass along the message for you. When Maggie told me, I left to come get you.‚Äù*

My blood froze. Something about what this thing was telling me felt like a thinly veiled threat from my mother.

Not only that, but the mechanics behind the copy‚Äôs arrival felt like a paradox. The God Thread that I‚Äôm infected with is either acting like an implanted GPS tracker, or it can somehow relay what I‚Äôm thinking. Otherwise, how did this copy find me at precisely the right time, distracted and vulnerable to being cornered? I‚Äôm damn sure no one had been tailing me.

But here‚Äôs the problem - Camila‚Äôs already proven that she can use that God Thread to control my actions remotely. She orchestrated the punch that concussed Maggie, and didn‚Äôt allow me to leave my grandmother‚Äôs estate until I stole the mining logs. So, if that‚Äôs the case, why even bother to send this copy all the way out here to coax me back to Maggie? Why not just command me to come home? Does her control over me wane with distance, or is there something more complex going on?

Perhaps most importantly, does this mean Camila is working against Maggie, or with her?

I decided I could dwell on the ‚Äúwhys‚Äù later. Basically, it seemed like this copy could track me, but it couldn‚Äôt override my will like Camila could. An unproven hypothesis at first, but there was a simple way to test the theory, thankfully.

Softening my features, I produced a lie.

*‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm sorry about that love - I guess I‚Äôm not feeling like myself. I can tell you more about it when we get home, yeah? I‚Äôll follow you in my car?‚Äù*

A wide, affectionate smile flowered on the copy.

*‚ÄúSounds good, love.‚Äù*

We both entered our respective vehicles and began driving towards the exit back onto the highway. I let the copy lead. Right as it pulled off the northbound ramp, I slammed my foot on the accelerator and swerved towards the southbound ramp.

I did not need to fight for control of the wheel as I drove south, confirming my suspicions.

\------------------------------

I spent the next five days in the wilderness. Made my way to the nearest national park and drove circles through it, never staying in one place for too long. When I had the energy, I spent time contemplating my next move.

Leave the life I've made and never return, or make my way back home to confront all of this head-on.

After much consideration, I‚Äôve decided on the latter. I‚Äôm going to find Maggie, which will ideally lead me to finding Camila.¬†*My*¬†Camila.

I‚Äôm about two hours away from my grandmother's estate - needed to make an important stop before I get any closer. If my plan is successful, I‚Äôll post another update. If it‚Äôs not, this may be my last post.

Regardless, thank you for following along and keeping me company.

I‚Äôve transcribed the last two mining logs below - the ones I intended to include at the end of the previous post, before I was interrupted by that copy. After reviewing it all, I believe I was correct in my interpretation of the poem‚Äôs underlines. Whoever placed them meant to hide a precise ""reading order"" of a few, specific logs. That said, it‚Äôs not exactly a message like I speculated in the previous post. It‚Äôs more than that.

When you read them in succession, they form a manual, as well as a kind of record.

Those five logs concisely explain where Camila came from, how she was created, and I can hopefully use that information to free her.

(As a reminder:¬†**LAL**¬†stands for ""Living Alloy"", and¬†**SSMC**¬†stands for the Stella-Signata Mining Company.)

In any case, here‚Äôs to praying that my first ever surgery goes well. Never been under the knife, nor have I ever wielded one. The two shots of vodka I just ingested will hopefully dull the pain without rendering my fingers useless. Not sure how dexterous I will be after the shock from the taser, too.

But if I'm going to confront Maggie, I should probably remove the God Thread from my body first.

Cheers,

\-Jack.

***Contents:***¬†Personal Operational Logs

The anniversary of Afonso‚Äôs death has stirred something within me. At first, I resisted. Memories I thought I had repressed completely came flooding back with the turn of the month. I fought hard to cage them, and they sure as hell fought hard back trying to be freed. They were mercilessly incessant, knocking at all hours of the night, begging to be let back in from the cold recesses of my subconscious. I was almost successful at sealing them away forever, I think.

But when I least expected it, those repressed memories found a crack in my defenses. One morning outside the warehouse, a fateful breeze carried the scent of sea salt and citrus fruit through my mental blockade like a Trojan horse. The fragrance is unambiguously of Portugal - an olfactory coat of arms, emblematic of this beautiful country. Under its influence, I could not help but think of Afonso. Visions of him poured out of that Trojan horse once it was past the barrier, lighting my soul on fire in the process. His life, his passion, his death - the squandered potential of it all.

The only meaningful thing I‚Äôve done in the last year is keep the company away from the LAL. Using the¬†[mercury adjacent symbol](https://imgur.com/a/mercury-adjacent-symbol-4n6b6st)¬†carved on my palm as a compass, I kept the SSMC's ships close to the LAL, but not close enough to actually capture it. Not too far away to the point where they‚Äôd think I‚Äôm sabotaging their operation, either. I maintained the illusion of a chase. A carrot on a stick that they‚Äôd run after but never be able to reach.

I had resigned myself to that hole of a purpose, too. But his memory pulled me out. His unjust demise revitalized me.

In the end, despite the pain, I am grateful. When I finally gave in, it was like imperceptible jumper cables crossed the impossible distance that lies between the void and my body. From somewhere beyond, Afonso clipped them to my heart, flipped a switch, and jolted me awake.

I realized that, at best, my interference was a temporary fix to a much more complicated problem. If I wanted to stop the SSMC indefinitely, I would need to get ahead of them somehow. Learn more about the LAL in secret. Find something that would give me a broader view of what was going on.

Figured town would be a good place to start. They‚Äôve known about the LAL for centuries, just by a different name.

*Marrow Drinkers.*

\------------------------------

It took only a week to find what I was searching for. Most of the locals were unwilling to speak to me, let alone help me find a resource on the Marrow Drinkers. My attempts at Portuguese only elicited a seething rage that was pervasive among the islanders. After what the SSMC had done, it wasn't unexpected. I was running out of people to ask when I walked into the small inn on the edge of town opposite to base camp, though.

The elderly innkeeper was the first one to smile at me when I pleaded with her for any information she had on the local legends, specifically Marrow Drinkers. As I spoke, she retrieved a leatherbound tome from the top of a bookcase behind the counter, its maroon casing weathered and wrinkled from decades of use.

Emblazoned on the cover in silver wire, the title read:¬†*Anjos Ca√≠dos da Luz Violeta: Uma Hist√≥ria dos Bebedores de Medula e sua Alquimia.*

Rough translation: ‚Äú*Fallen Angels of The Violet Light: A History of Marrow Drinkers and their Alchemy.*‚Äù

She told me I could not take the book with me, but I was welcome to sit in the lobby and review the text over some coffee she was currently brewing, free of charge.

**The information I compiled from the text includes:**

\-Marrow Drinkers first appeared in historical texts around the year 1520, about three months after a massive volcano erupted off the coast of Portugal, fairly close to this island. Because of the fiery prologue to their arrival, Marrow Drinkers have always been closely associated with Satan/Lucifer.

\-In the beginning, their presence in local culture was not subtle. The book recounted many tales of massive, iridescent tides of liquid metal assailing naval vessels. Tentacles arising from the deep and splaying sailors open, removing their bones to harvest marrow in full view of their compatriots. These occurrences were apparently so prevalent that Marrow Drinkers even started appearing in art and literature from the time,¬†[see below](https://imgur.com/a/NePrbyo).

\-Survivors of these attacks were known to go missing in the weeks that followed. In one instance, the wife of a captain caught him leaving their house in the dead of night, ‚Äúpossessed by the devil‚Äù. She attests that, despite her pleas, he walked half a mile to the shore and into the ocean, acting as if he could not hear her.

\-Before he lost himself to the call of the abyss, however, he had reproduced an all too familiar insignia - the mercury-adjacent symbol. He drew it on his nightstand, in his bible, even on the back of his hand. When questioned by the local pastor, the captain reportedly refuted the claim that the symbol was an expression of paganism or a demonic sigil. Quite the opposite, in fact. He told his parish that the God Mother, horrific and radiant, had visited within a dream to provide him a map.

*‚ÄúUma ferramenta para encontrar o caminho de casa.‚Äù*¬†\- ""A tool to find his way home.""

\------------------------------

Overwhelmed by throbbing panic, I shut the book.

The last passage hit a little too close to home. Upon approaching the innkeeper to give it back, I saw that night had fallen. Translating the text was grueling work that required focus, but I didn‚Äôt realize eight hours had passed me by. I considered staying at the inn for the night. The streets were notoriously unsafe for SSMC workers, especially when they were shrouded within a starless night. Ultimately, I opted to walk home, not wanting David or Franklin to become suspicious of my leisure-time activities.

As much as it shames me to admit, I took advantage of that old woman‚Äôs generosity, covertly pocketing a few torn pages of¬†*Fallen Angels of The Violet Light*¬†into my pocket before I returned it.

I should have been more vigilant while making my way back to base camp. Maybe I could have prevented the encounter if I directed my attention externally rather than internally, but I found myself consumed by what I had uncovered. Then again, killing that man was the first domino in a very important cascade of developments.

It is what it is, I suppose.

The pungent stench of cheap liquor intermixed with fetid saliva slithered across my cheeks and into my nostrils before I even saw him. Turning my head to identify the source of the ghastly odor only resulted in a brutish hand conforming tightly around my vulnerable neck.

A tall ox of a man, delirious with drink, had decided to strike back at the SSMC by snuffing me out, apparently.

To my surprise, no matter how hard he squeezed, I didn‚Äôt feel myself getting woozy from oxygen deprivation. It did still hurt, though. I clawed at his chest and arms, but it became obvious that I had no chance at overpowering him. As my terror rose, however, a primal autopilot took over for me. My right hand found its way to the side of his face, and I pushed. Not with the muscles in my hand, but with the skin itself.

Eleven fleshy bayonets erupted from my palm and into my would-be assailant.

As they ravaged him, I experienced multiple terrible sensations in unison. A velvety squish as one needle mangled the jelly within his skull. A thick, earthy crunch as another exploded through his cheekbone. Whatever lies directly in between those sensations is what it felt like to wedge sharpened skin through the black meat of his pupil.

His life ended in an instant. In a sense, mine ended in tandem.

The dead man collapsed, face riddled with holes, causing monstrous thunder as his heavy frame connected with the hard ground. Once it did, I ran.

Although I could run from the scene itself, I found myself unable to escape its implications.

\------------------------------

You know, it‚Äôs funny. I‚Äôve memorized all there is to know about the LAL. Every research paper published by the SSMC, every data point, every theory about its origin. Despite that, I‚Äôve never asked¬†*where*¬†the original sample is. I mean, they wouldn‚Äôt just discard it, and none of the research I‚Äôve been privy to mentions what the SSMC did with it. A huge discrepancy that I somehow perpetually glossed over.

Part of my programing, I guess.

I needed a way to prove it, though. What I came up with wasn‚Äôt exactly elegant, but it gave me my answer all the same.

There were a few false starts, but eventually, I found the courage to cleanly slice a pinky toe off of my left foot.

At first, I thought I made a horrible miscalculation. The stump seemed to be spurting viscous blood all over the floor. But as I looked closer, really focusing what was in front of me, the blood disappeared. No residual wetness, no metallic taste on the tip of my tongue. The fluid just vanished. Gone like it was never there in the first place.

Another smart piece of programming on SSMC‚Äôs part. They needed me to believe I was human, and humans bleed. So, if I was injured, I needed to perceive bleeding.

From their perspective, if I discovered what I actually was, I might elect not to guide them to the remaining LAL.

Inside my bedroom, I bent over and picked up my pinky toe, placing the tiny appendage delicately at the center of my wooden desk. As time passed, its defining features melted away into a homogenous, iridescent puddle. Once disconnected from me, it only took a few minutes for the flesh to return to its natural form, a boiling mermaid scale bubbling helplessly on the surface of the desk.

Giving me the name ‚ÄúDanica‚Äù was a cute touch, I‚Äôll give them that. It‚Äôs the Slavic word for ‚Äúmorning star‚Äù, which is another name for Lucifer. An inside joke for David and Franklin's benefit, no doubt. Maybe it's what they're giggling about under their breaths all the time.

Slumping down onto the nearby rickety chair, I let the reality of the situation really take hold of me.

I¬†*am*¬†the sample of the LAL discovered on that beach all those years ago, or I‚Äôm at least the consciousness that‚Äôs been stitched into it.

Before I say anything else, I want to apologize for my last post‚Äôs sudden conclusion, as well as its incompleteness.

Assuming everything went according to plan, last Sunday should have been a quick, five-minute pit stop. If my ancient laptop really started acting up, maybe closer to a ten-minute break from my erratic movements. The odds of me being ambushed in that deserted truck stop appeared comfortably low, so immortalizing the mining logs on the internet felt like a worthwhile risk.

As I pulled off the highway, I told myself that if I got to the fifteen-minute mark without a successful upload, I would call the attempt a wash and try again another day. No matter the outcome, it should have been a brief excursion.

Removing the key from the ignition, my engine‚Äôs crackling growl faded away, leaving only the silence of the vacated lot. I methodically scanned my surroundings for threats, but found none. There were a handful of LED lamp fixtures scattered throughout the area that caught my attention as they flickered on and off, randomly spitting out globs of yellow light that matched the color of the full moon's hazy glow overhead. Otherwise, all was still.

Cautiously satisfied, I grabbed my open laptop from the passenger seat. In my head, I repeated a new mantra, trying to keep myself grounded:

*Hijack Wi-Fi from the closed Starbucks, share the logs, and then return to the interstate.*

It wasn‚Äôt a complicated plan, and yet it still went awry. Five days later, I‚Äôm still not entirely sure how I missed the vehicle approaching. Some combination of sleep exhaustion and mental fatigue dampening my senses? Probably. Alternatively, maybe the God Thread swimming through my flesh obscured her arrival? Can‚Äôt rule it out.

When I finally noticed that car creeping up behind mine, my stomach dropped through my gut like a goddamn anvil. Every muscle fiber I have contracted, as if increased tension would actually safeguard my brain and heart from whatever flavor of violence I was about to be baptized with.

Knowing I might never get another chance, I typed a fragmented sentence, clicked the post button, and then slammed the laptop shut. Pivoting my torso to face the vehicle, I couldn‚Äôt determine who was in the driver‚Äôs seat. The car idled ominously, blinding me with its headlights.

I wondered if my life was over, and how that meant I‚Äôd never get the opportunity to say my goodbyes to Camila. That painful moment felt infinite. Cocooned inside rays of harsh light, boundless fear stretched and contorted each passing second into an entire eon of perceived time. Decades came and went as I braced myself for the gentle thump of a silenced bullet gliding through me, the promise of a hundred tomorrowless days written on my ruptured chest in blood.

Finally, my vision went black, but not on death‚Äôs account.

A car door softly clicked open as the headlights dimmed, and someone emerged. While I waited for my night vision to readjust, they were just a human smudge standing motionless outside a compact sedan.

*‚ÄúJack‚Ä¶is that you?‚Äù*

Recognizing the voice instantly, I practically threw myself out of the car, rabid with hope.

*‚ÄúCamila! Where have you been? Are you hurt?‚Äù*

Initially, I felt waves of relief wash over me. When my pupils adjusted, I saw Camila. Blue-white eyes like arctic waters meeting my own. Wispy blonde curls rising over her collarbones like golden smoke. She looked flesh and blood, upright and intact - this was my wife, I thought. She was wearing¬†*her*¬†clothes, driving¬†*her*¬†car. Seeing her so full and complete inspired a sort of amnestic lovesickness in me. I had missed Camila so much, who she was before all of this, and here that version of her stood. Inundated by a sea of endorphins, I became drunk enough to forget.

As I embraced her, however, she spoke again.

*‚ÄúOf course I‚Äôm okay! Why wouldn‚Äôt I be? Why did you want to meet here, anyway? Are you ready to go home?‚Äù*

The waves of relief soured like rotting meat, and I came crashing back to reality.

With my lovesickness now erased, other, nastier things found purchase in the vacuum that it left behind. Camila‚Äôs deflation. Maggie revealing that my wife was on loan to me from some organization related to my grandmother‚Äôs business. Her transformation. God Thread. The mining logs. The description of a young man‚Äôs bones torn from his body by threads of sentiment metal.

A living alloy, capable of changing shape at will.

I pushed her away, and she fell backward on to the ground.

*‚ÄúCamila‚Ä¶tell me where you‚Äôve been.‚Äù*¬†I said, standing over her.

She genuinely looked confused and hurt by my actions. It stung seeing her in pain, but her fall caused me to notice something important from my vantage point, the collar of her T-Shirt creasing to reveal the top of her sternum.

The woman had no port.

No scar or bandage to indicate it had been removed, either. There was nothing but blemishless skin on the front of her chest.

This wasn‚Äôt¬†*my*¬†Camila.

*‚ÄúJesus, what‚Äôs gotten in to you?‚Äù*

She stood up, brushing some small grains of asphalt off her jeans. After a pause, she moved one foot toward me, which caused me to move several steps back in response. Seemingly exasperated, she tried appealing to me.

*‚ÄúAlright, Jack, I‚Äôll answer your question. Just...just settle, I guess. Well‚Ä¶I was sick today. Had a nerve flare, posted myself up on the couch. You called Maggie to see if she could help, which apparently she could, because I'm feeling better now, and uhh‚Ä¶well, you called and told me to meet you here a little after 10PM.‚Äù*

Her brow furrowed with confusion as she gave me an explanation of the events that led up to this moment, like she was realizing in real time that something about her memory was wrong. Tainted by something out of her control.

Like the fact that some parts were completely fictional, and the parts that were true occurred almost two weeks ago, not a few hours ago.

*‚ÄúWait, no‚Ä¶actually, you didn‚Äôt tell me that. You asked Maggie to pass along the message for you. When Maggie told me, I left to come get you.‚Äù*

My blood froze. Something about what this thing was telling me felt like a thinly veiled threat from my mother.

Not only that, but the mechanics behind the copy‚Äôs arrival felt like a paradox. The God Thread that I‚Äôm infected with is either acting like an implanted GPS tracker, or it can somehow relay what I‚Äôm thinking. Otherwise, how did this copy find me at precisely the right time, distracted and vulnerable to being cornered? I‚Äôm damn sure no one had been tailing me.

But here‚Äôs the problem - Camila‚Äôs already proven that she can use that God Thread to control my actions remotely. She orchestrated the punch that concussed Maggie, and didn‚Äôt allow me to leave my grandmother‚Äôs estate until I stole the mining logs. So, if that‚Äôs the case, why even bother to send this copy all the way out here to coax me back to Maggie? Why not just command me to come home? Does her control over me wane with distance, or is there something more complex going on?

Perhaps most importantly, does this mean Camila is working against Maggie, or with her?

I decided I could dwell on the ‚Äúwhys‚Äù later. Basically, it seemed like this copy could track me, but it couldn‚Äôt override my will like Camila could. An unproven hypothesis at first, but there was a simple way to test the theory, thankfully.

Softening my features, I produced a lie.

*‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm sorry about that love - I guess I‚Äôm not feeling like myself. I can tell you more about it when we get home, yeah? I‚Äôll follow you in my car?‚Äù*

A wide, affectionate smile flowered on the copy.

*‚ÄúSounds good, love.‚Äù*

We both entered our respective vehicles and began driving towards the exit back onto the highway. I let the copy lead. Right as it pulled off the northbound ramp, I slammed my foot on the accelerator and swerved towards the southbound ramp.

I did not need to fight for control of the wheel as I drove south, confirming my suspicions.

\------------------------------

I spent the next five days in the wilderness. Made my way to the nearest national park and drove circles through it, never staying in one place for too long. When I had the energy, I spent time contemplating my next move.

Leave the life I've made and never return, or make my way back home to confront all of this head-on.

After much consideration, I‚Äôve decided on the latter. I‚Äôm going to find Maggie, which will ideally lead me to finding Camila.¬†*My*¬†Camila.

I‚Äôm about two hours away from my grandmother's estate - needed to make an important stop before I get any closer. If my plan is successful, I‚Äôll post another update. If it‚Äôs not, this may be my last post.

Regardless, thank you for following along and keeping me company.

I‚Äôve transcribed the last two mining logs below - the ones I intended to include at the end of the previous post, before I was interrupted by that copy. After reviewing it all, I believe I was correct in my interpretation of the poem‚Äôs underlines. Whoever placed them meant to hide a precise ""reading order"" of a few, specific logs. That said, it‚Äôs not exactly a message like I speculated in the previous post. It‚Äôs more than that.

When you read them in succession, they form a manual, as well as a kind of record.

Those five logs concisely explain where Camila came from, how she was created, and I can hopefully use that information to free her.

(As a reminder:¬†**LAL**¬†stands for ""Living Alloy"", and¬†**SSMC**¬†stands for the Stella-Signata Mining Company.)

In any case, here‚Äôs to praying that my first ever surgery goes well. Never been under the knife, nor have I ever wielded one. The two shots of vodka I just ingested will hopefully dull the pain without rendering my fingers useless. Not sure how dexterous I will be after the shock from the taser, too.

But if I'm going to confront Maggie, I should probably remove the God Thread from my body first.

Cheers,

\-Jack.

***Contents:***¬†Personal Operational Logs

The anniversary of Afonso‚Äôs death has stirred something within me. At first, I resisted. Memories I thought I had repressed completely came flooding back with the turn of the month. I fought hard to cage them, and they sure as hell fought hard back trying to be freed. They were mercilessly incessant, knocking at all hours of the night, begging to be let back in from the cold recesses of my subconscious. I was almost successful at sealing them away forever, I think.

But when I least expected it, those repressed memories found a crack in my defenses. One morning outside the warehouse, a fateful breeze carried the scent of sea salt and citrus fruit through my mental blockade like a Trojan horse. The fragrance is unambiguously of Portugal - an olfactory coat of arms, emblematic of this beautiful country. Under its influence, I could not help but think of Afonso. Visions of him poured out of that Trojan horse once it was past the barrier, lighting my soul on fire in the process. His life, his passion, his death - the squandered potential of it all.

The only meaningful thing I‚Äôve done in the last year is keep the company away from the LAL. Using the¬†[mercury adjacent symbol](https://imgur.com/a/mercury-adjacent-symbol-4n6b6st)¬†carved on my palm as a compass, I kept the SSMC's ships close to the LAL, but not close enough to actually capture it. Not too far away to the point where they‚Äôd think I‚Äôm sabotaging their operation, either. I maintained the illusion of a chase. A carrot on a stick that they‚Äôd run after but never be able to reach.

I had resigned myself to that hole of a purpose, too. But his memory pulled me out. His unjust demise revitalized me.

In the end, despite the pain, I am grateful. When I finally gave in, it was like imperceptible jumper cables crossed the impossible distance that lies between the void and my body. From somewhere beyond, Afonso clipped them to my heart, flipped a switch, and jolted me awake.

I realized that, at best, my interference was a temporary fix to a much more complicated problem. If I wanted to stop the SSMC indefinitely, I would need to get ahead of them somehow. Learn more about the LAL in secret. Find something that would give me a broader view of what was going on.

Figured town would be a good place to start. They‚Äôve known about the LAL for centuries, just by a different name.

*Marrow Drinkers.*

\------------------------------

It took only a week to find what I was searching for. Most of the locals were unwilling to speak to me, let alone help me find a resource on the Marrow Drinkers. My attempts at Portuguese only elicited a seething rage that was pervasive among the islanders. After what the SSMC had done, it wasn't unexpected. I was running out of people to ask when I walked into the small inn on the edge of town opposite to base camp, though.

The elderly innkeeper was the first one to smile at me when I pleaded with her for any information she had on the local legends, specifically Marrow Drinkers. As I spoke, she retrieved a leatherbound tome from the top of a bookcase behind the counter, its maroon casing weathered and wrinkled from decades of use.

Emblazoned on the cover in silver wire, the title read:¬†*Anjos Ca√≠dos da Luz Violeta: Uma Hist√≥ria dos Bebedores de Medula e sua Alquimia.*

Rough translation: ‚Äú*Fallen Angels of The Violet Light: A History of Marrow Drinkers and their Alchemy.*‚Äù

She told me I could not take the book with me, but I was welcome to sit in the lobby and review the text over some coffee she was currently brewing, free of charge.

**The information I compiled from the text includes:**

\-Marrow Drinkers first appeared in historical texts around the year 1520, about three months after a massive volcano erupted off the coast of Portugal, fairly close to this island. Because of the fiery prologue to their arrival, Marrow Drinkers have always been closely associated with Satan/Lucifer.

\-In the beginning, their presence in local culture was not subtle. The book recounted many tales of massive, iridescent tides of liquid metal assailing naval vessels. Tentacles arising from the deep and splaying sailors open, removing their bones to harvest marrow in full view of their compatriots. These occurrences were apparently so prevalent that Marrow Drinkers even started appearing in art and literature from the time,¬†[see below](https://imgur.com/a/NePrbyo).

\-Survivors of these attacks were known to go missing in the weeks that followed. In one instance, the wife of a captain caught him leaving their house in the dead of night, ‚Äúpossessed by the devil‚Äù. She attests that, despite her pleas, he walked half a mile to the shore and into the ocean, acting as if he could not hear her.

\-Before he lost himself to the call of the abyss, however, he had reproduced an all too familiar insignia - the mercury-adjacent symbol. He drew it on his nightstand, in his bible, even on the back of his hand. When questioned by the local pastor, the captain reportedly refuted the claim that the symbol was an expression of paganism or a demonic sigil. Quite the opposite, in fact. He told his parish that the God Mother, horrific and radiant, had visited within a dream to provide him a map.

*‚ÄúUma ferramenta para encontrar o caminho de casa.‚Äù*¬†\- ""A tool to find his way home.""

\------------------------------

Overwhelmed by throbbing panic, I shut the book.

The last passage hit a little too close to home. Upon approaching the innkeeper to give it back, I saw that night had fallen. Translating the text was grueling work that required focus, but I didn‚Äôt realize eight hours had passed me by. I considered staying at the inn for the night. The streets were notoriously unsafe for SSMC workers, especially when they were shrouded within a starless night. Ultimately, I opted to walk home, not wanting David or Franklin to become suspicious of my leisure-time activities.

As much as it shames me to admit, I took advantage of that old woman‚Äôs generosity, covertly pocketing a few torn pages of¬†*Fallen Angels of The Violet Light*¬†into my pocket before I returned it.

I should have been more vigilant while making my way back to base camp. Maybe I could have prevented the encounter if I directed my attention externally rather than internally, but I found myself consumed by what I had uncovered. Then again, killing that man was the first domino in a very important cascade of developments.

It is what it is, I suppose.

The pungent stench of cheap liquor intermixed with fetid saliva slithered across my cheeks and into my nostrils before I even saw him. Turning my head to identify the source of the ghastly odor only resulted in a brutish hand conforming tightly around my vulnerable neck.

A tall ox of a man, delirious with drink, had decided to strike back at the SSMC by snuffing me out, apparently.

To my surprise, no matter how hard he squeezed, I didn‚Äôt feel myself getting woozy from oxygen deprivation. It did still hurt, though. I clawed at his chest and arms, but it became obvious that I had no chance at overpowering him. As my terror rose, however, a primal autopilot took over for me. My right hand found its way to the side of his face, and I pushed. Not with the muscles in my hand, but with the skin itself.

Eleven fleshy bayonets erupted from my palm and into my would-be assailant.

As they ravaged him, I experienced multiple terrible sensations in unison. A velvety squish as one needle mangled the jelly within his skull. A thick, earthy crunch as another exploded through his cheekbone. Whatever lies directly in between those sensations is what it felt like to wedge sharpened skin through the black meat of his pupil.

His life ended in an instant. In a sense, mine ended in tandem.

The dead man collapsed, face riddled with holes, causing monstrous thunder as his heavy frame connected with the hard ground. Once it did, I ran.

Although I could run from the scene itself, I found myself unable to escape its implications.

\------------------------------

You know, it‚Äôs funny. I‚Äôve memorized all there is to know about the LAL. Every research paper published by the SSMC, every data point, every theory about its origin. Despite that, I‚Äôve never asked¬†*where*¬†the original sample is. I mean, they wouldn‚Äôt just discard it, and none of the research I‚Äôve been privy to mentions what the SSMC did with it. A huge discrepancy that I somehow perpetually glossed over.

Part of my programing, I guess.

I needed a way to prove it, though. What I came up with wasn‚Äôt exactly elegant, but it gave me my answer all the same.

There were a few false starts, but eventually, I found the courage to cleanly slice a pinky toe off of my left foot.

At first, I thought I made a horrible miscalculation. The stump seemed to be spurting viscous blood all over the floor. But as I looked closer, really focusing what was in front of me, the blood disappeared. No residual wetness, no metallic taste on the tip of my tongue. The fluid just vanished. Gone like it was never there in the first place.

Another smart piece of programming on SSMC‚Äôs part. They needed me to believe I was human, and humans bleed. So, if I was injured, I needed to perceive bleeding.

From their perspective, if I discovered what I actually was, I might elect not to guide them to the remaining LAL.

Inside my bedroom, I bent over and picked up my pinky toe, placing the tiny appendage delicately at the center of my wooden desk. As time passed, its defining features melted away into a homogenous, iridescent puddle. Once disconnected from me, it only took a few minutes for the flesh to return to its natural form, a boiling mermaid scale bubbling helplessly on the surface of the desk.

Giving me the name ‚ÄúDanica‚Äù was a cute touch, I‚Äôll give them that. It‚Äôs the Slavic word for ‚Äúmorning star‚Äù, which is another name for Lucifer. An inside joke for David and Franklin's benefit, no doubt. Maybe it's what they're giggling about under their breaths all the time.

Once I met her, I was shocked because she looked exactly like this girl that bullied my boyfriend (Cliffe) until he committed suicide. For some context, his twin brother had cancer and this disgusting person (lets call her May) bullied him for missing so much school, having a dead brother, and for being the 'second choice' to his parents. When I met the girl (lets call her Sophia), she looked exactly like May. For context, Cliffe died just three months before this. I was so mad, even though I knew they weren‚Äôt the same person. Every time I looked at her, I thought that she was May. I get really mad when I see her because she just reminds me of May and if May didn‚Äôt do it to him, then maybe he‚Äôd still be here to go on coffee dates and finish our bucket list. He was certain that a scout was going to get him into the Junior Leagues next year, and his dream was to play for the Astros, but she took that dream away from him. He was at grief counseling and rehab, he was getting better but she pushed him over the edge. According to everyone, Sophia was the nicest person ever, and I told my best friends (let's call them Halle and Tracey), they said that I was overreacting. Halle said that it was immature and that I should suck it up and I was a horrible person for thinking that way. Tracey, who‚Äôs my absolute best friend ever gets it, but she‚Äôs also really close with Sophia. Two days later, Halle told me that she‚Äôs been calling Sophia her best friend when I‚Äôm not there and it genuinely hurt me because she said that she‚Äôd always be on my side. I know it's just pure chance but it sucks that someone looking so much like May is taking away my best friends. I feel guilty for antagonizing it, but then a bit later suddenly my friend told me that Halle is telling everyone that I‚Äôm talking shit about Sophia which I‚Äôm not. I never said anything bad about her, everything I‚Äôve said was directed to May or on how they look similar. Now there‚Äôs an overnight trip being thrown in our faces and even after agreeing to dorm me, Tracey, and Halle. Halle went behind my back and is forcing me to dorm with Sophia, saying that I‚Äôm immature and lying about me talking shit about her and saying that I told her that I hated Tracey. I feel stuck because now Tracey doesn‚Äôt trust me anymore when she‚Äôs my absolute best friend and I love her more than anything. Now, Sophia is telling everyone that she hates me and that I‚Äôm insensitive, I get it but I feel like I have a valid reason to ignore her and that she should at least give me some space and understand. Now my bigger group which includes all of them is split on whether I have a valid reason. Do I??

Before I say anything else, I want to apologize for my last post‚Äôs sudden conclusion, as well as its incompleteness.

Assuming everything went according to plan, last Sunday should have been a quick, five-minute pit stop. If my ancient laptop really started acting up, maybe closer to a ten-minute break from my erratic movements. The odds of me being ambushed in that deserted truck stop appeared comfortably low, so immortalizing the mining logs on the internet felt like a worthwhile risk.

As I pulled off the highway, I told myself that if I got to the fifteen-minute mark without a successful upload, I would call the attempt a wash and try again another day. No matter the outcome, it should have been a brief excursion.

Removing the key from the ignition, my engine‚Äôs crackling growl faded away, leaving only the silence of the vacated lot. I methodically scanned my surroundings for threats, but found none. There were a handful of LED lamp fixtures scattered throughout the area that caught my attention as they flickered on and off, randomly spitting out globs of yellow light that matched the color of the full moon's hazy glow overhead. Otherwise, all was still.

Cautiously satisfied, I grabbed my open laptop from the passenger seat. In my head, I repeated a new mantra, trying to keep myself grounded:

*Hijack Wi-Fi from the closed Starbucks, share the logs, and then return to the interstate.* 

It wasn‚Äôt a complicated plan, and yet it still went awry. Five days later, I‚Äôm still not entirely sure how I missed the vehicle approaching. Some combination of sleep exhaustion and mental fatigue dampening my senses? Probably. Alternatively, maybe the God Thread swimming through my flesh obscured her arrival? Can‚Äôt rule it out.

When I finally noticed that car creeping up behind mine, my stomach dropped through my gut like a goddamn anvil. Every muscle fiber I have contracted, as if increased tension would actually safeguard my brain and heart from whatever flavor of violence I was about to be baptized with.

Knowing I might never get another chance, I typed a fragmented sentence, clicked the post button, and then slammed the laptop shut. Pivoting my torso to face the vehicle, I couldn‚Äôt determine who was in the driver‚Äôs seat. The car idled ominously, blinding me with its headlights.

I wondered if my life was over, and how that meant I‚Äôd never get the opportunity to say my goodbyes to Camila. That painful moment felt infinite. Cocooned inside rays of harsh light, boundless fear stretched and contorted each passing second into an entire eon of perceived time. Decades came and went as I braced myself for the gentle thump of a silenced bullet gliding through me, the promise of a hundred tomorrowless days written on my ruptured chest in blood. 

Finally, my vision went black, but not on death‚Äôs account.

A car door softly clicked open as the headlights dimmed, and someone emerged. While I waited for my night vision to readjust, they were just a human smudge standing motionless outside a compact sedan. 

*‚ÄúJack‚Ä¶is that you?‚Äù*

Recognizing the voice instantly, I practically threw myself out of the car, rabid with hope.

*‚ÄúCamila! Where have you been? Are you hurt?‚Äù*

Initially, I felt waves of relief wash over me. When my pupils adjusted, I saw Camila. Blue-white eyes like arctic waters meeting my own. Wispy blonde curls rising over her collarbones like golden smoke. She looked flesh and blood, upright and intact - this was my wife, I thought. She was wearing *her* clothes, driving *her* car. Seeing her so full and complete inspired a sort of amnestic lovesickness in me. I had missed Camila so much, who she was before all of this, and here that version of her stood. Inundated by a sea of endorphins, I became drunk enough to forget.

As I embraced her, however, she spoke again.

*‚ÄúOf course I‚Äôm okay! Why wouldn‚Äôt I be? Why did you want to meet here, anyway? Are you ready to go home?‚Äù*

The waves of relief soured like rotting meat, and I came crashing back to reality. 

With my lovesickness now erased, other, nastier things found purchase in the vacuum that it left behind. Camila‚Äôs deflation. Maggie revealing that my wife was on loan to me from some organization related to my grandmother‚Äôs business. Her transformation. God Thread. The mining logs. The description of a young man‚Äôs bones torn from his body by threads of sentiment metal.

A living alloy, capable of changing shape at will.

I pushed her away, and she fell backward on to the ground.

*‚ÄúCamila‚Ä¶tell me where you‚Äôve been.‚Äù* I said, standing over her. 

She genuinely looked confused and hurt by my actions. It stung seeing her in pain, but her fall caused me to notice something important from my vantage point, the collar of her T-Shirt creasing to reveal the top of her sternum.

The woman had no port.

No scar or bandage to indicate it had been removed, either. There was nothing but blemishless skin on the front of her chest.

This wasn‚Äôt *my* Camila.

*‚ÄúJesus, what‚Äôs gotten in to you?‚Äù*

She stood up, brushing some small grains of asphalt off her jeans. After a pause, she moved one foot toward me, which caused me to move several steps back in response. Seemingly exasperated, she tried appealing to me. 

*‚ÄúAlright, Jack, I‚Äôll answer your question. Just...just settle, I guess. Well‚Ä¶I was sick today. Had a nerve flare, posted myself up on the couch. You called Maggie to see if she could help, which apparently she could, because I'm feeling better now, and uhh‚Ä¶well, you called and told me to meet you here a little after 10PM.‚Äù*

Her brow furrowed with confusion as she gave me an explanation of the events that led up to this moment, like she was realizing in real time that something about her memory was wrong. Tainted by something out of her control.

Like the fact that some parts were completely fictional, and the parts that were true occurred almost two weeks ago, not a few hours ago. 

*‚ÄúWait, no‚Ä¶actually, you didn‚Äôt tell me that. You asked Maggie to pass along the message for you. When Maggie told me, I left to come get you.‚Äù*

My blood froze. Something about what this thing was telling me felt like a thinly veiled threat from my mother.

Not only that, but the mechanics behind the copy‚Äôs arrival felt like a paradox. The God Thread that I‚Äôm infected with is either acting like an implanted GPS tracker, or it can somehow relay what I‚Äôm thinking. Otherwise, how did this copy find me at precisely the right time, distracted and vulnerable to being cornered? I‚Äôm damn sure no one had been tailing me.

But here‚Äôs the problem - Camila‚Äôs already proven that she can use that God Thread to control my actions remotely. She orchestrated the punch that concussed Maggie, and didn‚Äôt allow me to leave my grandmother‚Äôs estate until I stole the mining logs. So, if that‚Äôs the case, why even bother to send this copy all the way out here to coax me back to Maggie? Why not just command me to come home? Does her control over me wane with distance, or is there something more complex going on?

Perhaps most importantly, does this mean Camila is working against Maggie, or with her?

I decided I could dwell on the ‚Äúwhys‚Äù later. Basically, it seemed like this copy could track me, but it couldn‚Äôt override my will like Camila could. An unproven hypothesis at first, but there was a simple way to test the theory, thankfully.

Softening my features, I produced a lie.

*‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm sorry about that love - I guess I‚Äôm not feeling like myself. I can tell you more about it when we get home, yeah? I‚Äôll follow you in my car?‚Äù*

A wide, affectionate smile flowered on the copy.

*‚ÄúSounds good, love.‚Äù*

We both entered our respective vehicles and began driving towards the exit back onto the highway. I let the copy lead. Right as it pulled off the northbound ramp, I slammed my foot on the accelerator and swerved towards the southbound ramp.

I did not need to fight for control of the wheel as I drove south, confirming my suspicions.

\------------------------------

I spent the next five days in the wilderness. Made my way to the nearest national park and drove circles through it, never staying in one place for too long. When I had the energy, I spent time contemplating my next move.

Leave the life I've made and never return, or make my way back home to confront all of this head-on.

After much consideration, I‚Äôve decided on the latter. I‚Äôm going to find Maggie, which will ideally lead me to finding Camila. *My* Camila.

I‚Äôm about two hours away from my grandmother's estate - needed to make an important stop before I get any closer. If my plan is successful, I‚Äôll post another update. If it‚Äôs not, this may be my last post.

Regardless, thank you for following along and keeping me company.

I‚Äôve transcribed the last two mining logs below - the ones I intended to include at the end of the previous post, before I was interrupted by that copy. After reviewing it all, I believe I was correct in my interpretation of the poem‚Äôs underlines. Whoever placed them meant to hide a precise ""reading order"" of a few, specific logs.  That said, it‚Äôs not exactly a message like I speculated in the previous post. It‚Äôs more than that.

When you read them in succession, they form a manual, as well as a kind of record.

Those five logs concisely explain where Camila came from, how she was created, and I can hopefully use that information to free her.

(As a reminder: **LAL** stands for ""Living Alloy"", and **SSMC** stands for the Stella-Signata Mining Company.)

In any case, here‚Äôs to praying that my first ever surgery goes well. Never been under the knife, nor have I ever wielded one. The two shots of vodka I just ingested will hopefully dull the pain without rendering my fingers useless. Not sure how dexterous I will be after the shock from the taser, too.

But if I'm going to confront Maggie, I should probably remove the God Thread from my body first. 

Cheers,

\-Jack.

***Contents:***¬†Personal Operational Logs

The anniversary of Afonso‚Äôs death has stirred something within me. At first, I resisted. Memories I thought I had repressed completely came flooding back with the turn of the month. I fought hard to cage them, and they sure as hell fought hard back trying to be freed. They were mercilessly incessant, knocking at all hours of the night, begging to be let back in from the cold recesses of my subconscious. I was almost successful at sealing them away forever, I think.

But when I least expected it, those repressed memories found a crack in my defenses. One morning outside the warehouse, a fateful breeze carried the scent of sea salt and citrus fruit through my mental blockade like a Trojan horse. The fragrance is unambiguously of Portugal - an olfactory coat of arms, emblematic of this beautiful country. Under its influence, I could not help but think of Afonso. Visions of him poured out of that Trojan horse once it was past the barrier, lighting my soul on fire in the process. His life, his passion, his death - the squandered potential of it all.

The only meaningful thing I‚Äôve done in the last year is keep the company away from the LAL. Using the [mercury adjacent symbol](https://imgur.com/a/mercury-adjacent-symbol-4n6b6st) carved on my palm as a compass, I kept the SSMC's ships close to the LAL, but not close enough to actually capture it. Not too far away to the point where they‚Äôd think I‚Äôm sabotaging their operation, either. I maintained the illusion of a chase. A carrot on a stick that they‚Äôd run after but never be able to reach.

I had resigned myself to that hole of a purpose, too. But his memory pulled me out. His unjust demise revitalized me.

In the end, despite the pain, I am grateful. When I finally gave in, it was like imperceptible jumper cables crossed the impossible distance that lies between the void and my body. From somewhere beyond, Afonso clipped them to my heart, flipped a switch, and jolted me awake.

I realized that, at best, my interference was a temporary fix to a much more complicated problem. If I wanted to stop the SSMC indefinitely, I would need to get ahead of them somehow. Learn more about the LAL in secret. Find something that would give me a broader view of what was going on. 

Figured town would be a good place to start. They‚Äôve known about the LAL for centuries, just by a different name.

*Marrow Drinkers.*

\------------------------------

It took only a week to find what I was searching for. Most of the locals were unwilling to speak to me, let alone help me find a resource on the Marrow Drinkers. My attempts at Portuguese only elicited a seething rage that was pervasive among the islanders. After what the SSMC had done, it wasn't unexpected. I was running out of people to ask when I walked into the small inn on the edge of town opposite to base camp, though.

The elderly innkeeper was the first one to smile at me when I pleaded with her for any information she had on the local legends, specifically Marrow Drinkers. As I spoke, she retrieved a leatherbound tome from the top of a bookcase behind the counter, its maroon casing weathered and wrinkled from decades of use.

Emblazoned on the cover in silver wire, the title read: *Anjos Ca√≠dos da Luz Violeta: Uma Hist√≥ria dos Bebedores de Medula e sua Alquimia.*

Rough translation: ‚Äú*Fallen Angels of The Violet Light: A History of Marrow Drinkers and their Alchemy.*‚Äù

She told me I could not take the book with me, but I was welcome to sit in the lobby and review the text over some coffee she was currently brewing, free of charge.

**The information I compiled from the text includes:**

\-Marrow Drinkers first appeared in historical texts around the year 1520, about three months after a massive volcano erupted off the coast of Portugal, fairly close to this island. Because of the fiery prologue to their arrival, Marrow Drinkers have always been closely associated with Satan/Lucifer.

\-In the beginning, their presence in local culture was not subtle. The book recounted many tales of massive, iridescent tides of liquid metal assailing naval vessels. Tentacles arising from the deep and splaying sailors open, removing their bones to harvest marrow in full view of their compatriots. These occurrences were apparently so prevalent that Marrow Drinkers even started appearing in art and literature from the time, [see below](https://imgur.com/a/NePrbyo).

\-Survivors of these attacks were known to go missing in the weeks that followed. In one instance, the wife of a captain caught him leaving their house in the dead of night, ‚Äúpossessed by the devil‚Äù. She attests that, despite her pleas, he walked half a mile to the shore and into the ocean, acting as if he could not hear her. 

\-Before he lost himself to the call of the abyss, however, he had reproduced an all too familiar insignia - the mercury-adjacent symbol. He drew it on his nightstand, in his bible, even on the back of his hand. When questioned by the local pastor, the captain reportedly refuted the claim that the symbol was an expression of paganism or a demonic sigil. Quite the opposite, in fact. He told his parish that the God Mother, horrific and radiant, had visited within a dream to provide him a map.

*‚ÄúUma ferramenta para encontrar o caminho de casa.‚Äù* \- ""A tool to find his way home.""

\------------------------------

Overwhelmed by throbbing panic, I shut the book. 

The last passage hit a little too close to home. Upon approaching the innkeeper to give it back, I saw that night had fallen. Translating the text was grueling work that required focus, but I didn‚Äôt realize eight hours had passed me by. I considered staying at the inn for the night. The streets were notoriously unsafe for SSMC workers, especially when they were shrouded within a starless night. Ultimately, I opted to walk home, not wanting David or Franklin to become suspicious of my leisure-time activities.

As much as it shames me to admit, I took advantage of that old woman‚Äôs generosity, covertly pocketing a few torn pages of *Fallen Angels of The Violet Light* into my pocket before I returned it.

I should have been more vigilant while making my way back to base camp. Maybe I could have prevented the encounter if I directed my attention externally rather than internally, but I found myself consumed by what I had uncovered. Then again, killing that man was the first domino in a very important cascade of developments.

It is what it is, I suppose.

The pungent stench of cheap liquor intermixed with fetid saliva slithered across my cheeks and into my nostrils before I even saw him. Turning my head to identify the source of the ghastly odor only resulted in a brutish hand conforming tightly around my vulnerable neck.

A tall ox of a man, delirious with drink, had decided to strike back at the SSMC by snuffing me out, apparently.

To my surprise, no matter how hard he squeezed, I didn‚Äôt feel myself getting woozy from oxygen deprivation. It did still hurt, though. I clawed at his chest and arms, but it became obvious that I had no chance at overpowering him. As my terror rose, however, a primal autopilot took over for me. My right hand found its way to the side of his face, and I pushed. Not with the muscles in my hand, but with the skin itself.

Eleven fleshy bayonets erupted from my palm and into my would-be assailant. 

As they ravaged him, I experienced multiple terrible sensations in unison. A velvety squish as one needle mangled the jelly within his skull. A thick, earthy crunch as another exploded through his cheekbone. Whatever lies directly in between those sensations is what it felt like to wedge sharpened skin through the black meat of his pupil.

His life ended in an instant. In a sense, mine ended in tandem.

The dead man collapsed, face riddled with holes, causing monstrous thunder as his heavy frame connected with the hard ground. Once it did, I ran.

Although I could run from the scene itself, I found myself unable to escape its implications.

\------------------------------

You know, it‚Äôs funny. I‚Äôve memorized all there is to know about the LAL. Every research paper published by the SSMC, every data point, every theory about its origin. Despite that, I‚Äôve never asked *where* the original sample is. I mean, they wouldn‚Äôt just discard it, and none of the research I‚Äôve been privy to mentions what the SSMC did with it. A huge discrepancy that I somehow perpetually glossed over.

Part of my programing, I guess.

I needed a way to prove it, though. What I came up with wasn‚Äôt exactly elegant, but it gave me my answer all the same.

There were a few false starts, but eventually, I found the courage to cleanly slice a pinky toe off of my left foot.

At first, I thought I made a horrible miscalculation. The stump seemed to be spurting viscous blood all over the floor. But as I looked closer, really focusing what was in front of me, the blood disappeared. No residual wetness, no metallic taste on the tip of my tongue. The fluid just vanished. Gone like it was never there in the first place.

Another smart piece of programming on SSMC‚Äôs part. They needed me to believe I was human, and humans bleed. So, if I was injured, I needed to perceive bleeding. 

From their perspective, if I discovered what I actually was, I might elect not to guide them to the remaining LAL.

Inside my bedroom, I bent over and picked up my pinky toe, placing the tiny appendage delicately at the center of my wooden desk. As time passed, its defining features melted away into a homogenous, iridescent puddle. Once disconnected from me, it only took a few minutes for the flesh to return to its natural form, a boiling mermaid scale bubbling helplessly on the surface of the desk.

Giving me the name ‚ÄúDanica‚Äù was a cute touch, I‚Äôll give them that. It‚Äôs the Slavic word for ‚Äúmorning star‚Äù, which is another name for Lucifer. An inside joke for David and Franklin's benefit, no doubt. Maybe it's what they're giggling about under their breaths all the time. 

Slumping down onto the nearby rickety chair, I let the reality of the situation really take hold of me.

I *am* the sample of the LAL discovered on that beach all those years ago, or I‚Äôm at least the consciousness that‚Äôs been stitched into it.

***Recent Insights:*** 

\-**LAL cannot breathe outside of water,** unless it has been modified (excised toe almost died once it wasn‚Äôt attached to me. Lives in my bathtub now. Small droplet of liquid metal, swims aimlessly all day. I‚Äôve named her after the innkeeper who lent me the book - Camila)

\-**LAL cannot grow in the traditional sense**. I‚Äôve fed Camila plenty of marrow, human and animal. It‚Äôs allowed her to modify her shape, but she remained the same size. Overtime, however, my toe regenerated. When I excised it a second time and placed it into the bath, the two pieces merged into one larger piece.

\-**I have two modifications**: an internal one (chest cavity, ‚Äúshrapnel from my time in The Gulf War‚Äù), and an external one (wrist band, ‚Äúepilepsy medical alert bracelet‚Äù).

\-I believe my internal modification **suppresses my ability to change shape**, but I cannot prove it. 

\-My external modification **allows me to breathe above water,** and this is conclusive. When I take it off, I feel like I'm drowning, and I become weak. Additionally, the space below the bracelet is sensitive, and a different texture. Maybe that area functions like gills. Thankfully, unlike my internal modification, it appears to be detachable.

\-**Electricity is destabilizing**. When I ate Milo, Franklin‚Äôs second in command, he tried to jab at me with a cattle prod.

***Statement of Intent:***

Once Camila is big enough, I am going to kill Franklin and feed her his marrow. Then, using my external modification, she can leave the bathtub safely. Masquerading as Franklin, Camila can get close to David. 

She will then bring him back here, and we will determine our purpose. If we have none, we will kill David and then return to the sea.",3,1737163393.0,TheCrypticCompendium,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm a 36yr old female at 225lbs. I‚Äôve been overweight and struggled with yo-yo dieting/weight loss my whole life. 

The first memory I have of any type of symptom is actually as far back as 2018. The symptoms were bloating after meals and belching. Back then, I didn‚Äôt have great insurance and everyone kept saying it‚Äôs probably gerd or just sensitivity to certain foods, etc. The symptoms consistently got worse as time went on. The last 2-3 years have been the worst despite me being my healthiest and losing 35-40lbs. At my heaviest in 2021, I was almost 270lbs. I decided to get serious and developed healthier eating habits, exercised and drank only water/coffee. That‚Äôs how I got down to 225. Even through this fitness journey, I was experiencing symptoms. My symptoms were as follows:

- feeling extremely full after eating small meals
- sharp, gnawing pain in left shoulder, sometimes even my chest and left arm
- very rarely but sometimes acid reflux
- constant belching 
- inconsistent bowel movements

The only relief I could find these last 2 years are by laying on my left side which somehow helped move trapped air for me. This would result in the worst, most embarrassing belches or passing gas but I would finally get relief. If that didn‚Äôt happen, I would have to vomit to try to empty my stomach as much as possible. I was vomiting 2-3 times a week.

I finally advocated for myself and pushed my PCP to refer me to a GI for an endoscopy after months of her trying to manage everything with pantaprazole. That medication only worsened my symptoms. Endo was done July 2024 and the GI knew immediately that I had a hiatal hernia due to how my stomach was twisting. Suggested I have surgery almost immediately.

Of course with the medical system, immediately didn‚Äôt happen. The first surgeon I was referred to was a general surgeon who was not instilling any confidence with me in his ability to treat my hernia. After X-rays and contrast CT, the scans showed almost my entire stomach was in my chest and twisted upside down. A thoracic surgeon was necessary.

Finally, in December, I met with Dr. Shawn Groth in Houston, TX and from the first meeting, I felt in way more capable hands. He explained that the scans showed a giant paraesophageal hernia and a swallow test showed minimal acid problems so he made a laparoscopic surgery plan to repair my hernia, repair the diaphragm defect and do a gastropexy where the stomach is attached to the abdominal wall to prevent this from happening again. There was no need to for a fundiplication which I was happy to hear.

Cut to Jan 13th and it‚Äôs surgery day. It was supposed to be a 2-3 hour surgery and I was meant to go home that same day. Once my surgeon got in there, he saw that I actually had two hernias. A smaller than they thought hiatal hernia and a large diaphragmatic hernia. My entire stomach, part of my colon and a hernia sac were in my chest. The surgery took 2 hours longer due to this. Apparently, the diaphragmatic hernia had been there for a long time because there was a lot of adhesions. The surgeon said that the diaphragmatic hernia could have been congenital and just grown or a result of some type of injury but I don‚Äôt have any memory of any kind of injury that could‚Äôve caused it. Despite all this, the surgery was completed successfully.

I woke up from surgery with an NG tube which was HORRIBLE. They explained the details and that I would need to stay overnight for monitoring. Honestly, the NG tube was the worst part. My pain wasn‚Äôt too bad (thanks morphine) but I couldn‚Äôt drink anything due to the tube and it wasn‚Äôt taken out til the next morning. Throat and nose were sore.

After post op tests showed esophagus was working properly, I was able to go on a clear liquid diet and was discharged that evening.

Currently at home, post op day 4 and on a full liquid diet. Other than pain from some trapped gas from when they inflate your abdomen for surgery and mild incision pain, I feel great! I‚Äôm taking Tylenol and gabapentin for pain. Also have tramadol if I need it. I‚Äôm able to walk around and do my breathing exercises with no issues and today was the first day I felt my appetite again! Looking forward to starting the soft food diet in 3 days. I‚Äôll be on soft food diet for 2-3 weeks depending on how I feel. So far, no symptoms from before surgery but only time will tell once I start eating regular food again. I‚Äôm extremely optimistic, though as I currently feel wonderful and can actually feel my stomach moving things normally which I hadn‚Äôt felt in years!

I know this post is long but I‚Äôve been coming to this community for information since I‚Äôve gotten diagnosed and it has helped so much. I just wanted to put my story out there to help, as well!",7,1737163235.0,HiatalHernia,2,1.0,False
1i3w6xe,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1i3w6xe/issue_opening_board_game_cafe/,Issue Opening Board Game Cafe,"I found a ton of great info and suggestions from past posts here as I created (on paper) a version of a board game cafe that would thrive in my town of Ocean City, NJ. There will be quite a bit going on in the space (after school programs, summer camps, etc. in addition to the normal options), but will be light on food and drink options. The plan was just prepackaged goods, baked goods from a local bakery, and a bunch of cold bottled beverage options.

  
I'm not sure if anyone can help, but I filed a pre-application for a mercantile license prior to signing a lease and was rejected by the city due to being classified as an ""entertainment facility"". Retail stores, cafes, professional offices, and many other types of business are allowed in our downtown area, but apparently not one deemed to be entertainment driven which is insane to me. We even have a business that is essentially a walk-in art studio that sells pottery that you paint/decorate. Maybe because you have to buy the pottery they are considered a retail store even though the whole point is the entertainment part.

  
Has anyone else run into this? I'm trying to get my head wrapped around it all before sitting down with the head of the zoning office. Like do I really need to sell coffee and pastries so that I could be considered a cafe?

  
This was an unexpected hurdle, but thanks in advance for any advice!",1,1737163203.0,boardgames,7,0.6,False

1i3w3dj,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuittingZyn/comments/1i3w3dj/did_i_shorten_my_lifespan/,Did I shorten my lifespan?,"A little preface, I‚Äôm currently 21, born in 2003. I never really vaped during highschool. When my senior year came around, people started using Zyns and other Pouches. 

I decided to try one at a party during early 2021. I loved them immediately, like most people do. The focus, the sharpness, the stomach feeling weightless, the ‚Äúrelief‚Äù. 

Spearmint‚Äôs were my go to. I was always aware of the addictive nature these products have, so I always limited myself to 3x - 6x a day. I‚Äôve never been the type to go through a pack a day. They eventually don‚Äôt even give me a buzz , just satisfy a craving. Also I frequently got hiccups from zyns. 

I‚Äôll never forget the feeling of being in senior year of highschool during covid, getting on a flight early in the morning for a trip. I put in my AirPods and popped 2x 6mg spearmint‚Äôs right as the plane took off. I‚Äôll never forget the feeling I had when the plane left the ground, as a I watched the beautiful sunset peak through the clouds. It was like I had timed the buzz and the weightless feeling of flying perfectly. Plus that was my first ever time doing two. 

Since then, I went to college in the fall. I had converted so many chronic Vapers into pouch fanatics. At least a dozen of my friends began using Zyns as a part of my trailblazing. At one point freshman year, I had quit for a month or so ; just because the prices on Zyns were going up weekly. I eventually went back on them. 

Fast forward to end of Sophomore year of college. I was still hooked on Zyns. Maybe there was days here and there where‚Äôd I‚Äôd run out and deal with it, or borrow from a friend. But I generally always took at least one pouch. They were my absolute crutch. For work, for relaxation, for partying, for class, shit even for dessert. I still never typically exceeded 5 or 6 of them. Two packs a week I‚Äôd say. So I always thought this was a safe amount. 

Sophomore year I had developed a bad Pot habit (from NY, very cheap accessible). I had also been a decent coffee fan, 1 cup a day, maybe 2. I was drinking coffee, taking 3-6 zyns, smoking bong 5+ times a day, and on the weekends I would get drunk. 

That summer after Sophomore year (2023), I stopped using zyns for a couple weeks, maybe over a month. I felt pretty fine, I would use TeaZa pouches instead. I eventually craved in again before going to school for junior year. 

Fast forward AGAIN! Junior year was rough, I got prescribed a couple different SSRI‚Äôs and eventually Adderall for my ADD. So another stimulant in the mix. While all still doing Zyn. Some days I was really able to slim down my usage with pouches, but of course the Pot, Coffee, and Adderall were good alternatives. But it felt like Zyns are what kept this all together. They were my glue. 

I‚Äôm now entering my last semester of college in 2025. Wow time has flown. And I‚Äôve had my good buddy Zyn always by my side. I‚Äôm sick of having a 3 day ~$7 subscription to something so pointless. I need to take them at random times for no reason! Luckily, I‚Äôve left Weed in the past. I simply have a predisposition to substance abuse. And only I can control that ! 

I‚Äôve been wanting to quit all of senior year. But I ran out of pouches yesterday and I finally decided to make the change. I have become so worrysome about things ever since needing so many substances! (I also used to do a good amount of preworkout too)

Im worried I‚Äôm gonna develop some sort of cardio condition. Or have a premature heart attack. I don‚Äôt sleep well these days. And I also have a terrible back condition. 

I‚Äôve came to the this thread to use this post as a reminder. 

TLDR: have my habits caused me to live a shorter life? is there anyway quitting nicotine can undo the damage? Do people who take adderall and coffee live shorter lives? I eat pretty healthy, and workout just about daily. I‚Äôm just worried the zyns have caused too much strain. ",2,1737162909.0,QuittingZyn,5,1.0,False

**Chapter II**

**The Neighborhood**


The Morning brought warmth and clarity to Astral‚Äôs mind. It also brought a pounding to his door.  He got up and shuffled his way to the door and yawned deeply as he opened it, still wrapped in his blanket. Ukiko was up, dressed and looking at him in a cross between utter contempt and annoyance.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Astral blinked slowly, like a cat who just got yelled at.

‚ÄúWe need to go to my office to get you some paperwork.‚Äù She laughed, ‚ÄúBut you should get ready first.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight...‚Äù Astral dropped his blanket, revealing his muscular and scarred frame as well as that he was just in his boxers with a few tattoos on his legs. 

Ukiko immediately turned around after diverting her eyes. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll make you some coffee, go shower. And put on pants!‚Äù 

Astral closed his door and went to take a shower. He wasn‚Äôt too happy that there was a bath in the same room. A close call in his teens had left him phobic of baths in general, sometimes even filled sinks. Still he made his short time worth it, hot water always felt good on sore muscles and he could handle higher than normal temperatures. Once he was done he got dressed and walked across the hall and knocked on Ukiko‚Äôs door.

When it opened she handed him a stiff plastic cup filled with rich smelling coffee. Another one was in her other hand as she closed the door and locked it. Astral smiled and nodded in appreciation for the coffee as they made their way to the elevator. 

‚ÄúSo...‚Äù Astral took a sip and looked at it in shock. ‚ÄúThis is actually good.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù Ukiko smiled, ‚ÄúProbably not what you were going to say though?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, what kind of stuff are you giving me?‚Äù Astral inquired with a lazy yawn.

‚ÄúYour Hanko stamp for one. You‚Äôll need it for official documentation. Well the direct government stuff. Heroes get to use signatures nowadays.‚Äù Ukiko explained, ‚ÄúMostly if you have to go to court you‚Äôll need it to sign official documents.‚Äù 

Astral curled his lip in disgust. 

‚ÄúI know, it‚Äôs an incredibly old tradition, and we‚Äôve tried more than once to get past it.‚Äù Ukiko chuckled, ‚ÄúCurrent Prime Minister is trying to roll out a ten year phase out plan.‚Äù 

‚ÄúVote for that guy, got it.‚Äù Astral snorted.

‚ÄúWoman, but yes. When you get the right to vote. You‚Äôre a resident, not a citizen. You need to be here five years first.‚Äù Ukiko said, ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs because you‚Äôre a hero.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI really hate that.‚Äù Astral sighed, ‚ÄúI always just called myself a Private Investigator in America. Can‚Äôt I do that here?‚Äù 

Ukiko nodded, ‚ÄúWe can, you‚Äôll need to take a few tests and study some laws, but it shouldn‚Äôt be too hard. Your hero status, again, will make it easier. And you wouldn‚Äôt even be the first hero Investigator.‚Äù 

The doors opened and they walked out. Astral looked around as they went out the front doors this time. He saw vending machines every few hundred feet or so. Different companies, but so many options cluttered the streets. 

‚ÄúThe good news is I‚Äôm a ten minute walk from work, so you get to see some of the neighborhood.‚Äù Ukiko said as she pointed the way to go. ‚ÄúCome on, you can get a vending breakfast if you want, but I wouldn‚Äôt suggest it.‚Äù She laughed.

Astral paused for a brief moment just a few steps into their walk and looked at a vending machine that was filled with various ‚Äúdanishes‚Äù that he was certain were just toaster pastries. He sipped his coffee and continued on. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôll take a street vendor meal first.‚Äù He began to look around. 

Ukiko nodded. Then she spoke up, ‚ÄúYou have a lot of scars too.‚Äù 

Astral nodded. ‚ÄúDaemons don‚Äôt go easy.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI also did some more looking into your background. They didn‚Äôt mention you were coming from a six month stay in the hospital. Are you sure you‚Äôre good to stress yourself out like last night?‚Äù 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine. It was a suicide watch.‚Äù Astral snorted.

Ukiko froze and he took a few more steps before turning to face her. A sad smile took his face.

‚ÄúRemember my friend?‚Äù He asked.

Ukiko nodded.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt take losing her well.‚Äù Astral sighed, ‚ÄúShe was like a big sister.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre better?‚Äù Ukiko asked.

‚ÄúAs far as the doctors and church care.‚Äù He smirked, ‚ÄúI was never a danger to myself honestly. But they found a way to ground me before shipping me off.‚Äù

Ukiko took a sip with a thoughtful scrunch of her brow.

Astral gave a chuckle. ‚ÄúCute when you get into a deep thought.‚Äù 

Ukiko whipped her head up and glared at him, though she felt her cheeks flush as she blushed.

‚ÄúSorry, crossed a line.‚Äù Astral sighed and rubbed his temple, ‚ÄúI do that a lot. Don‚Äôt mean to most of the time, just prickly that way.‚Äù 

Ukiko took a breath, ‚ÄúThank you for your apology. And your compliment, however inappropriate it was.‚Äù 

Astral smiled and nodded for her to take the lead again. 

She smirked as she passed him, ‚ÄúBesides, I can tell you definitely work out.‚Äù 

Astral gave a booming laugh, more than a few people looked his way then moved on. He just watched curiously and then whipped around as he felt like someone was watching him again.

‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù Ukiko asked.

‚ÄúYeah, just someone watching. Probably a yokai or spirit or something. Definitely not on the normal reading.‚Äù Astral sighed, ‚ÄúShouldn‚Äôt be surprised I did just alert everyone for like...‚Äù He paused. ‚ÄúMetrics system, uh...‚Äù He did math in his head, ‚ÄúLike maybe four to five kilometers, that I‚Äôm here.‚Äù 

Ukiko nodded. ‚ÄúOther than your Hanko, I would like to go over your legal documents. I have questions and I suspect getting answers from you would be easier than the Charter Committee.‚Äù 

‚ÄúCommittee?‚Äù Astral shuddered. ‚ÄúAnd I thought the Organization sounded bad.‚Äù 

Ukiko chuckled, ‚ÄúDid you ever work with any big heroes?‚Äù 

Astral shrugged, ‚ÄúWent to Dross once, worked with Trident. Met SideEffect, preferred the clown. Got bailed out by Quain.‚Äù 

‚ÄúMost people here think SideEffect is terrifying.‚Äù Ukiko said, ‚ÄúWe really like Trident though.‚Äù She smiled.

‚ÄúEh, he‚Äôs not bad. Better than Pike.‚Äù Astral shrugged.

‚ÄúPike Score, he‚Äôs the head of the New York Organization, yes?‚Äù Ukiko said, ‚ÄúSomething about an American Football theme?‚Äù 

Astral rolled his eyes. ‚ÄúHe can charge energy into objects. Likes to use these shrunken down footballs, yeah. Friggin lunatic, as far as I‚Äôm concerned. Narcissistic S.O.B. is part of the reason...‚Äù He stopped and took a breath. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not on my friends list.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI suspect not many are.‚Äù Ukiko nodded, then winced. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, that was rude of me.‚Äù 

‚ÄúBut not wrong.‚Äù Astral smirked and noticed a food stand, ‚ÄúDo you mind?‚Äù He pointed to it.

Ukiko looked it over. ‚ÄúNot a bad option. I need something too, I‚Äôll cover it.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThanks, since, you know. No cash.‚Äù Astral nodded.

‚ÄúOh!‚Äù Ukiko put her briefcase on a bench and opened it, then handed Astral an envelope. ‚ÄúI forgot to give this to you last night. It‚Äôs your first month‚Äôs stipend.‚Äù 

Astral took it and put it into a pocket inside his coat 

‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt that hot?‚Äù The vendor asked as they approached.

‚ÄúNah, takes more than summer heat to mess with me.‚Äù Astral smiled, ‚ÄúCan I get the veggie mix?‚Äù 

‚ÄúI‚Äôll take the number three.‚Äù Ukiko smiled and nodded, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be paying.‚Äù 

The street vendor smiled and started to cook the food.

‚ÄúWhat is this anyway?‚Äù Astral asked, ‚ÄúI don't‚Äô recognize it.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYuritai.‚Äù The vendor smiled, ‚ÄúRana recipe mixed with omurice wrapped in a fried bread. Great for a fast breakfast.‚Äù 

‚ÄúNeat.‚Äù Astral smiled and watched the man cook. 

‚ÄúMy wife‚Äôs father taught me.‚Äù The vendor laughed, ‚ÄúShe can‚Äôt cook to save her life, but she‚Äôs amazing with money and knowing how to sell stuff.‚Äù 

‚ÄúIt looks amazing.‚Äù Ukiko smiled.

The man finished the first wrap and handed it to Astral. ‚ÄúFor a hungry man who can take the heat!‚Äù 

‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù Astral said as he bowed his head slightly and watched as the second wrap was made and handed to Ukiko.

Ukiko paid and took her meal and the two began to walk once more right before they ran into a strange stall. Astral looked at it for a moment before he realized it was a fortune teller‚Äôs stall. There was currently a line, but he made note of its location.

‚ÄúYou like fortune telling?‚Äù Ukiko chuckled.

‚ÄúIf they got the gift, yeah.‚Äù Astral nodded, ‚ÄúAlways good to know how the winds are blowing.‚Äù 

Ukiko stared for a moment as she processed his words. ‚ÄúIs it real?‚Äù 

‚ÄúIt can be. If the person actually has the gift then they can get small glimpses.‚Äù Astral said, ‚ÄúClairvoyance is a rare gift even in our world with a man that throws purple barriers and a man made of the earth.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAnd yokai and half-angels.‚Äù Ukiko added. ‚ÄúHere.‚Äù she pointed to a door and turned and stopped to finish her meal.  

Astral finished his while standing beside her and watched as she tossed the remains into a small cylinder no wider than five inches in diameter. A vertical label read ‚ÄúMASSXSTORE TRASH‚Äù. He smirked and did the same.

‚ÄúBest foreign company in Japan.‚Äù Ukiko smiled, ‚ÄúThey have all our country‚Äôs disposal and storage contracts. We help them with tech in return. They‚Äôre bleeding edge for a reason.‚Äù

Astral nodded, he knew MassXStore was tied in with multiple governments, their trash bins were in multiple countries. Mostly ones that had previously had trouble storing or removing trash. Their storage racks were only in a few limited countries.

‚ÄúI mean, fair.‚Äù Astral followed her in and up a flight of stairs. ‚ÄúI just never understood why he hasn‚Äôt moved out of Dross City. Place damn near killed his wife a decade or two back.‚Äù 

‚ÄúHe loves his home.‚Äù Ukiko smiled, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve met him, he‚Äôs a pleasant sort.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou met Cedric Meissner.‚Äù Astral snorted.

‚ÄúI used to do corporate law.‚Äù Ukiko smiled, ‚ÄúBut I wanted to help people more, so I went into Criminal Law to protect people‚Äôs rights.‚Äù 

Astral smiled back, ‚ÄúSounds like a noble purpose.‚Äù He followed her into her office.

She gestured to a chair in front of her desk and he sat in it. She sat behind her desk and pulled a few folders out. She then pulled out a small box and opened it. Inside was a simple stamp and red ink pad. 

‚ÄúThis is your Hanko stamp.‚Äù She quickly showed him how to use it.

Astral held the stamp and shook his head. ‚ÄúYou said for me it‚Äôd be mostly court stuff, right? Could you hold onto it then please? I feel I‚Äôd just lose it.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI can, but if you need it in an emergency, it‚Äôll take me a bit to get it to you.‚Äù Ukiko said, ‚ÄúAnd if I‚Äôm busy it could take longer.‚Äù 

Astral shrugged, ‚ÄúAt least until I figure out how to carry this damn thing.‚Äù

Ukiko nodded. ‚ÄúI can do that at least. I imagine losing it flight would be problematic.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAnd easily missed.‚Äù Astral nodded.

‚ÄúOh! Have you met Mistress Falcon?‚Äù Ukiko asked.

Astral nodded, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs faster if you‚Äôre curious. She uses mini rockets to get a boost.‚Äù 

Ukiko nodded and pulled out an ID card and slid it forward. It was Japanese Residential ID and had several markings pertaining to Astral‚Äôs status as a hero. Ukiko‚Äôs finger was just above one.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this mark mean?‚Äù She asked.

‚ÄúVatican Mark, means I‚Äôm a Combat Exorcist.‚Äù Astral smiled, ‚ÄúMy main job, if you recall. It basically lets the Police know I‚Äôm cleared by a religious organization to fight spiritual threats.‚Äù

Ukiko wrote the information down. ‚ÄúAnd this one?‚Äù She slid her finger to the next one.‚Äù

Astral rolled his eyes, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a warning mark. I punched a chair on the Charter Organization's Senatorial committee.‚Äù  

Ukiko looked up in shock. 

‚ÄúYou know Quain? He‚Äôs got six.‚Äù Astral chuckled, ‚ÄúNone for a senator though, mostly just Trident.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat does it mean?‚Äù Ukiko asked.

Astral shrugged, ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs a tally to see how likely we are to hit people in charge.‚Äù

Ukikio nodded, ‚ÄúWhich Senator?‚Äù 

Astral smiled proudly, ‚ÄúArman Kincaid! Fuck him and his facist, gooset-stepping shit-heads.‚Äù

‚ÄúSenator Kincaid has friends in the Japanese government, best not to boast about that if you have to talk with them.‚Äù Ukiko warned.

‚ÄúSeriously?! That lich of a man has friends?‚Äù Astral rolled his eyes. ‚ÄúThanks for the warning.‚Äù 

Ukiko suppressed a laugh, but still smiled and nodded. She moved her finger to another mark that looked like a castle tower. 

Astral leaned forward. ‚ÄúThat one is new. I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù 

‚ÄúMight be tied to transferring you to Japan.‚Äù Ukiko nodded, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll look into it.‚Äù 

‚ÄúPlease do.‚Äù Astral nodded and picked up the ID and pulled out his wallet to switch his IDs. 

‚ÄúYou can still use your American ID for age related purchases, but use the Residential ID for anything else.‚Äù 

Astral shrugged, ‚ÄúEasier to just switch. Gonna be here a while anyway...‚Äù He tossed the old Id onto her desk. ‚ÄúKeep that for me?‚Äù 

Ukiko smiled and put it into a folder for him. ‚ÄúOf course. Do you need anything? I‚Äôve asked all I need to right now.‚Äù 

‚ÄúNot really. Gonna take a walk, see what‚Äôs around. Make some friends, maybe some enemies.‚Äù Astral nodded, ‚ÄúHow much is my stipend anyway?‚Äù 

‚ÄúTwenty-Five Million Yen a month.‚Äù Ukiko smiled.

Astral did another quick piece of math in his head. ‚ÄúOf course, now they pay me well.‚Äù He shook his head and took out the envelope and counted the money quickly. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the nearest bank?‚Äù 

Ukiko walked to a window and pointed out across the street. ‚ÄúProbably a good idea to deposit your money.‚Äù She then pulled a card out and handed it to him, ‚ÄúYour account card, I was asked to set it all up for you.‚Äù 

Astral looked at the card, then at her. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a handler aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù 

‚ÄúI think they think I am, now that I look at all the stuff they hired me to do.‚Äù Ukiko shook her head, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do it, but I‚Äôm not running operations for them.‚Äù 

Astral nodded, ‚ÄúThey get pushy, you let me know.‚Äù 

Ukiko nodded, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure I can handle it, but I will.‚Äù 

Astral smiled as he picked up the card and with a quick sleight of hand seemed to make it vanish. Then he waved and left and went across the street where he waited and deposited a fair amount of his pay into his new account. He honestly hated banks and preferred hard cash, it made buying some of the things he needed easier, but he knew it wasn‚Äôt entirely possible in Japan. It had mostly started moving away from physical cash since the Rana arrived. Most coinage had long since been phased out in favor of plastic cash notes and digital transactions.

Once he had his money in order and safely in his wallet he started his journey. His first stop was back the way he came, to the fortune teller. He stood in line for a few minutes before finally sitting down in front of an old woman. His angelic senses told him immediately he was dealing with something firmly above the normal level of humanity. He smiled, genuinely intrigued to see if this person had the gift.

‚ÄúGreetings.‚Äù The woman said in perfect English. ‚ÄúCanadian or American?‚Äù 

‚ÄúAmerican.‚Äù Astral smiled and observed the woman. 

Due to her sitting he couldn‚Äôt estimate her height,but she wasn‚Äôt stooped and still had the majority of her hair black with color, only a few areas were grayed and those were neatly arranged. She gestured to a sign in English to her left, her hands were well worn with callouses and leathery skin, but her face was soft in its appearance. She also barely seemed to have her eyes open. Astral looked to his right, the sign was in Japanese there. 

‚ÄúTarot.‚Äù He said in as Japanese an accent as he could muster.

The woman‚Äôs eyes opened slightly more after that. ‚ÄúAnd why would one descended from divine heritage seek guidance of the cards?‚Äù 

Astral snorted, ‚ÄúI just had a horny angel ancestor. Hardly divine.‚Äù 

The woman nodded and didn‚Äôt argue, ‚ÄúMy question remains? Why do you seek guidance?‚Äù 

‚ÄúI honestly don‚Äôt know. Need anything I can get right now. Daemons may be lurking and it‚Äôs my job to make them go bye-bye.‚Äù Astral sighed, ‚ÄúAlso maybe a hand to see if my lawyer would like a gift. She‚Äôs cute, but I don‚Äôt want her to get mad.‚Äù 

The woman laughed, ‚ÄúVery well. I am Madame K≈çun no Neko.‚Äù 

Astral chuckled and noticed that the woman‚Äôs table was covered in stickers of Lucky Cat statues and two actual statues sat behind her, each with a different paw raised. Then he realized her ears were on her head and she had none at the side of her head. 

‚ÄúAh, you see more than most.‚Äù The woman chuckled, ‚ÄúBut I can help.‚Äù She nodded to a jar for Astral to pay. 

Astral pulled out the yen and put the appropriate amount in, plus a little extra. He wasn‚Äôt surprised when she provided change for him almost immediately. 

‚ÄúRight, no tipping.‚Äù Astral sighed. 

‚ÄúAmerica doesn‚Äôt have that still, does it?‚Äù She asked.

‚ÄúNot as much, but it still exists.‚Äù Astral smiled, ‚ÄúPeople tend to forget Americans actually do want to share, our leaders just get their heads up their asses too much.‚Äù 

The woman shuffled her deck, ‚ÄúOh. I like you young man.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAstral.‚Äù Astral offered his name.

‚ÄúSo quick to offer a name with a yokai...‚Äù She smiled, ‚ÄúYou are either very brave or exceptionally stupid.‚Äù 

Astral shrugged, ‚ÄúProbably the latter to be honest.‚Äù 

Her eyes opened fully as she dealt the first card. Her eyes were emerald green and had the slit pupils of a cat. They were opened wide in surprise. Astral looked down at the first card, it was Death.

‚ÄúYeah, that tracks.‚Äù He laughed. ‚ÄúChange is big in my life right now.‚Äù 

She nodded and dealt the next one face down. Then the third, the fourth, the fifth and the sixth. She flipped what was there and Astral noticed that most of them were custom designs, with the Tower card being the Tokyo tower being trashed by _Godzilla_, the image dated the cards and the woman significantly.  

‚ÄúHaven‚Äôt seen the Big G be a bad guy. Is that Pre-Purge art?‚Äù Astral asked.

‚ÄúIt is.‚Äù She smiled, ‚ÄúA gift from a good friend during the invasion. I fought to help my city.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you get enough thanks, but thank you.‚Äù Astral smiled, genuinely happy to help a veteran of the worst war humanity had ever seen.  

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt actually.‚Äù She studied the cards. ‚ÄúYou are correct that your life is in deep change, some of it terrible, painful and nothing I would wish on my worst enemy. But they also tell me of a soul of resilience and rage.‚Äù She tapped the Tower card, then seemed distracted and waved.

Astral didn‚Äôt turn to see, he assumed it was a friend and just waited.

‚ÄúSorry, children are adorable when they realize what I am.‚Äù K≈çun smiled, ‚ÄúIs she yours?‚Äù 

Astral blinked and turned, ‚ÄúNo I don‚Äôt have kids...‚Äù He didn‚Äôt see anyone.

‚ÄúShe ran off...‚Äù K≈çun sighed, ‚Äú...Probably one of the diplomatic children in the area. I hope she stays safe, lots of buildings around here are as forgotten as some of the people.‚Äù 

Astral tilted his head, ‚ÄúNo one should be forgotten.‚Äù He took the change she had given him and put it back in her jar. ‚ÄúIt was a good reading and I think you do have the gift.‚Äù 

K≈çun shook her head and accepted the tip, ‚ÄúAs for the lady, I cannot speak for a modern woman, but if I were to have received a gift from you in my youth, I would have graciously accepted it.‚Äù She stood and bowed to him, she was only just as tall as Ukiko.

Astral returned the bow. ‚ÄúThank you for your insight.‚Äù He chuckled, ‚ÄúI will keep it all in mind.‚Äù 

He then made his way through the neighborhood. Learning the positions of stores and shops. He marked more than a few on his Geo-ogle maps app. He hated the thing, it always froze at the worst time no matter how new a phone he had. Then again that was just his relationship with technology,  he wondered what deity or ancient daemon he had offended with his birth to get such an annoying and frustrating plague of a curse. He was certain that whoever had done this to him was laughing their ass off somewhere. 

During his travels he met a few interesting people, mostly people who ran shops and had a small issue regarding a delinquent or an aggressive young thug, nothing organized, but something he noticed as odd given how many police were around and arresting them in seconds. It reminded him he needed to stop by the police station.

His attention was drawn from that slightly as he passed a few young teachers outside their school. It was a Junior High School and looked pretty average, but something inside caught his attention. The teachers provided the answer, rumors of ghosts and a nuppepp≈ç living in the walls. He wasn‚Äôt too sure what the latter one was and had to look it up and found it was a perfectly harmless yokai. He shrugged off the odd feeling as his angelic senses having trouble adapting to the new beings around him. Angels had a few extra senses, and so did half-angels, all aimed at detecting danger so he wasn‚Äôt surprised at the odd read on the school. He did stop and ask the teachers for some directions though as his phone decided to stop working at that moment.

Eventually though he noticed the time and where he was. It was a long walk back home so he found the nearest train station and checked the times. It was a twenty minute wait but it was better than a multi-hour walk back home, or exposing his power to the area again for a quick flight.

He dug around in his pockets and pulled out a box of candy cigarettes. If he was giving up the real thing he was going to need something to keep his jittery brain off the missing nicotine. He figured sugar would do. He looked at his phone quickly and was about to pull out his ear-buds when he heard the sound of approaching footsteps. He looked over his shoulder and saw a woman approaching. She wasn‚Äôt too intimidating on her own, but the masks that floated freely around her and the fact that she was dragging around an unconscious young man was all Astral needed to see. 

‚ÄúLeave mortal, the Lady of Masks doesn‚Äôt need you.‚Äù The woman sneered, blood poured from the side of her head where a fresh wound showed. Her prey had fought back.

Astral turned to face her and set his box of candy on a nearby pole. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm gonna have to tell you to let him go, and then I‚Äôm gonna have to arrest you. You get arrested, right?‚Äù He held the stub of his candy in his fingers like he would have held the remains of a real cigarette.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll rip your soul to pieces!‚Äù the woman roared as the masks flew to life and she dropped the young man to the ground. 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I like to hear. Got some fight to ya.‚Äù He grinned and flicked out the candy stub into the face of the creature, its reaction was all he needed. 

The flash of light that the candy made on impact was bright and multi-colored. It was the tell tale sign of a tulpa, the kind that came about from collective consciousness stirring its own shit. He dashed forward and grabbed the young man before racing up the stairs and setting him against a light pole. Then he turned around and ran back down the stairs, the Lady of Masks was just recovering. 

‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt have done that human.‚Äù Her masks turned to face him, she did not. Then one that looked like it was crying opened its mouth and an ear piercing wail slammed into Astral.

The pain rippled through his body and for a moment he forgot how to breathe, but the pain was his motivator. He sprang forwards and slammed his fist forward into the woman‚Äôs skull, but a mask that looked like a snarling face bit deep into his arm and tossed him away.

He rolled with the toss and chucked his coat, the damage never got through the special weave it was made of. He grinned, the masks were tough but not physically strong. He could work with that. He rushed in and faked a punch to the right, the angry mask came rushing in and he switched to a flip kick, the mask went soaring behind the two of them. 

‚ÄúWhat are you?‚Äù The Lady of Masks growled.

‚ÄúNightmare exterminator.‚Äù Astral chuckled right before the Angry mask flashed by his side, a sudden pain pierced his side as it did so. 

The Lady of Masks took the mask as it came to her, red stained its side and she licked it. ‚ÄúCelestial...‚Äù 

‚ÄúOh, I taste good then?‚Äù Astral winced. He hadn‚Äôt expected a bladed attack, and that was where he messed up, but then again this thing could have literally any attack any idiot or third grader could come up with if they were close enough.

‚ÄúI will enjoy your emotions. I think I‚Äôll leave you with fear.‚Äù The Lady began to approach. 

Astral grinned, ‚ÄúSorry. Fear‚Äôs a bit afraid of me you see.‚Äù He rushed forward and leaped over her but smashed his heel into the back of her skull, then he kept running until he was behind a pillar.

There he opened his coat and saw the wound, it wasn‚Äôt deep but it was an open wound in a fight. He needed a minute to charge his angelic powers to a healing touch, but he knew he wasn‚Äôt going to get it. He then looked black to see where the Lady was, only to find the station filled with fog. For a moment he panicked, he wasn‚Äôt sure who pulled out a blanket of fog, but it sure as hell wasn‚Äôt him. Then he heard the creature snarl.

‚ÄúWhere are you?!‚Äù The Lady roared, ‚ÄúStupid tricks won‚Äôt save you.‚Äù 

Astral grinned, he had some help here and he wasn‚Äôt going to look a gift horse in the mouth. He went to charge his hand to heal his wound but he watched the open wound close, blue energy washed over it as it leached into him from the fog. He touched it briefly and it was solid and real, healed from nowhere. He would really need to thank whoever did that. He then refocused and charged his fists and arms full of energy before taking off his coat and shirt. Then he let his wings spread. With a fully powered gust from his wings the fog was pushed back briefly before it rolled back in like a tsunami. It was just enough time for him to lock on to his enemy. 

He came in silently and smashed his fist into the face of the Lady of Masks. She went sailing to the other side of the station and bounced out one of the entrance tunnels. He followed and grabbed her as she rolled, he ascended with her until the city started to get small. 

‚ÄúGoing to arrest me?‚Äù She laughed, ‚ÄúFoolish human.‚Äù 

‚ÄúNah, we‚Äôre out of Tokyo jurisdiction.‚Äù Astral grinned as he cocked back his fist and drove it through her chest, pushing the core of what should have been a heart out of her chest. What came out was a screaming gout of energy that hissed like an angry gremlin. A singular eye-like orb glared at him before it vanished.

‚ÄúBesides, you don‚Äôt exist.‚Äù Astral dropped the dissolving body and descended to the train station in time to see the train leaving. 

He cursed as he got his shirt and coat, but was unhappy to find his candy was gone. He assumed someone getting off the train had taken it. He sighed and stepped back out onto the street and took to the sky. He had already exposed his power again for the second time in two days. It didn‚Äôt matter who saw him now, or what. 

He landed on the roof of his apartment and walked down to his apartment. He noticed a sticky note on his door. It was from Ukiko advising that he had left his door unlocked and she had locked it as well as left him a meal to warm up if he wanted it.  Astral took the note and smiled as he unlocked his door and went in. The meal was a simple bento box one could get at the corner store, but he was happy to have received it. He really was going to need to get her a gift now, he just didn‚Äôt know what would be too flirty and what was just flirty enough. He decided to consult the internet, if his phone would work with him. 

It did not.

1i3w1rd,https://www.reddit.com/r/MedicalCannabisOz/comments/1i3w1rd/possible_teacannabis_interaction/,Possible tea-cannabis interaction?,"I‚Äôm a lifelong tea and coffee drinker. I drink green tea all day everyday, and coffee or black tea occasionally as a treat. I only drink them for enjoyment as caffeine doesn‚Äôt seem to have stimulating effects on me. I often have a wide variety of different blends and brands in my pantry, and it‚Äôs hard to know exactly how much caffeine I consume each day as the packaging doesn‚Äôt include the caffeine content.

Before you say green tea doesn‚Äôt contain caffeine - this appears to be a myth. I recently read a study that found the caffeine content of tea did not vary according to the type of tea (white/green/black), here is a link [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19007524/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19007524/)

I‚Äôve noticed that on days when I drink particular brands of tea (not just any tea), my cannabis has absolutely no effect, like something in the tea is preventing it from working. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the caffeine, or some other compound like the tannins or terpenes in the tea. Whatever it is, it completely neutralises the effects of cannabis. No matter how much I vape, I don‚Äôt get any effects (positive or negative), no hangover the next day or delayed effects either. It‚Äôs just like I never vaped in the first place. And this can happen even if I drank the tea more than 12 hours before vaping.

I haven‚Äôt been able to find any information about this phenomenon online, and I‚Äôm very curious if anyone else has experienced the same thing. For reference, the particular brands of tea I‚Äôve noticed this effect with so far are Twinings Lady Grey and Dilmah Jasmine Green Tea. I don‚Äôt drink coffee often enough to know whether it also neutralises the cannabis.

P.S. I use MC for insomnia which is caused by a neurological disease and has a mind of its own unconnected to my caffeine intake - like I said, caffeine doesn't effect me and if it was causing my insomnia I would have stopped it years ago lol",0,1737162769.0,MedicalCannabisOz,4,0.5,False
1i3w1ne,https://www.reddit.com/r/christianblanco/comments/1i3w1ne/world_hunger_games_24th_hunger_games_reapings/,World Hunger Games: 24th Hunger Games: Reapings + Parade,"The Capital thrived as the Hunger Games season approached, particularly after Linker Nyugen of District 3 claimed a historic victory. With his mastery of sound equipment and a sharp sense of humor, he outwitted his opponents, providing the Capital with many laughs and unforgettable moments. Winning just days beyond his twelfth birthday, Linker became the youngest victor in the history of the Hunger Games, setting a record unlikely to be surpassed. The saga of the Golden Victor endured, bringing 13 remarkable champions, and anticipation was high for this trend to continue.

The Capital had Head Gamemaker Priscilla Cardew to thank for a new decade of memorable games and iconic victors. Her popularity had soared to new heights, though not quite eclipsing that of her husband Balthazar Grimstone and co-commentator Capricorn Luther. She faced mild criticism for her lack of Gamemaker or mutt events, and for not having a unique flair like Luther's boss fights or Grimstone's horror aesthetic. When it was time for the Head Gamemaker's interview on Artemis Radcliffe's morning show, *Good Morning Panem*, tickets for the live studio audience were snapped up instantly. Cardew, dressed in a white jumpsuit with orange ribbons, spoke to Artemis, who was clad in a daffodil-patterned dress. Cardew addressed the concerns about her lack of events by revealing that this year's games would pay homage to the era before the Golden Victor saga. She committed to implementing events but declined to disclose any details, despite Artemis's probing. She did reveal, however, that she had received considerable assistance from someone she anticipated would succeed her. Pressed for more information, she gave only one clue: this individual was a former Hunger Games mentor.

Linker postponed his sold-out standup comedy tour to embark on the reaping tour. Jase Toliver, the victor of the 11th Hunger Games, chose to miss the reaping tour to cherish the final days with his recently liberated father, Jansen Toliver, before the District 3 reaping required his departure to the Capital. Fortunately, Silas MacIntyre (victor of the 7th Hunger Games) offered to care for Jansen in Jase's absence. Instead, Linker was joined by Adam Quilliak and Faust, his elder brother. Linker celebrated his thirteenth birthday aboard the hoverjet, prior to the reaping of a young couple from District 12, Cera and Murmur (12). The reaping in District 3 was notably depressing, as no volunteers stepped forward for Alice (3), a fourteen-year-old girl who had recently gone into remission from leukemia. The situation worsened when Consul (3), a twelve-year-old, was selected, and peacekeepers forcibly separated him from his twin sister. In District 10, an intriguing scenario unfolded when both tributes, Carina and Bharat (10), were identified as Tammies from Tamarind Village, sharing a past with the lost city of Hyderabad, similar to their mentor, Sherpa Kapoor (victor of the 16th Hunger Games).

Linker Nguyen arrived in District 6 on a bright, sunny day with a breeze greeted at the runway by Mayor Rotom and the district's sole victor, Phoebe Bentley (the victor of the 3rd Hunger Games). Phoebe had been quite busy since her victory. Aside from rehabilitating warmweed addicts, she served as an on-call therapist for Hunger Games victors. She attempted to showcase the transportation factories, but Linker was more focused on updates regarding Jansen‚Äôs health plan. His interest piqued during the tour at the sight of the alcohol distilleries, where he humorously bemoaned his underage status. Mayor Rotom then unveiled a novel innovation: a carbonated nonalcoholic drink called soda, a recipe discovered by Capital scouts in the uncharted ruins and replicated by District 6's finest mixologists. It was an instant hit in the Capital, with three flavors available: cola, grape, and cherry. After sampling, Linker favored cherry, playfully suggesting, ‚ÄúHey doc, let‚Äôs see Bacchus pepper this up with some booze.‚Äù During a simple lunch of lamb and stewed vegetables, Linker teasingly inquired if Phoebe charged her fellow victors for therapy. Initially distracted by thoughts of the reaping, Phoebe missed the question. Adam expressed his empathy, acknowledging the challenge of mentoring for twenty-one years. Sensing the mood, Linker quietly resumed his meal and apologized with Phoebe brushing off the incident.

The siren that signaled the reaping attendance reverberated through District 6, prompting the youth to gather in the town center. Many children, intoxicated on warmweed, were forcibly escorted to the reaping square by peacekeepers. Linker, feeling a mix of nervousness and revulsion at the sight of the drugged individuals in the crowd, some with their amber clothes stained with grease and vomit, prepared himself. Following Mayor Rotom's lackluster introduction, Linker was nudged to deliver his victor's speech. He tried to inject some humor into the somber atmosphere, achieving only a few laughs, yet he took pride in his attempt to energize the dead audience. However, his ill-advised joke about Penny, ""I guess the god of speed found Penny to have some change in her head,"" referencing her demise the previous year, caused an uproar. Peacekeepers restrained Penny's older sister Tina furiously attempting to confront him on stage. Linker quickly apologized for his statement and moved to hasten the reaping process. Mayor Rotom concurred and motioned towards the female reaping bowl. Linker approached, drew a slip from the top, and announced the name: seventeen-year-old Petra Allison.

Whispers rippled through the reaping enclosures, but Phoebe's reaction was the most startling as her face turned ghostly pale. Artemis noticed this and surmised that Phoebe recognized the individual. The cameras soon captured peacekeepers escorting a tall, muscular girl with short golden-brown hair, green eyes, and a stern expression. She showed no emotion during her reaping and walked to the stage in silence, followed by peacekeepers. Artemis, intrigued by Petra's athletic build and neat appearance, retrieved some notes. Reading them, she confirmed Petra's connection to Phoebe: Petra was employed as a fitness instructor at the Kento Rehabilitation Centre. Luther reviewed the notes, delving into Petra's family background. Petra, one of three siblings, was the only one not ensnared by warmweed addiction. She was rescued from the streets after running away from home and taken in by the Kento Rehabilitation Centre. On the stage, Petra fixed Linker with an intimidating gaze before shaking his hand. After a fleeting look at Phoebe quietly mouthing ‚Äúshe‚Äôs scary‚Äù, to the amusement of the Maximus Square audience, Linker nodded his head and gestured to Petra where she should stand. Petra wordlessly assumed her position on the stage. Without delay, Linker drew a name from the male reaping bowl, announcing eighteen-year-old Phineas Ellingboe.

Whispers spread throughout the enclosure, casting assumptions on the reputation of the newly selected tribute. The cameras zoomed in on a tall, slender young man at the back, clad in an amber robe who sighed, seemingly more irritated than scared by the forthcoming ordeal. As he made his way up the aisle, the cameras captured his appearance, leaving the Capital audience in awe. Phineas, with his long, silky red hair and pale skin, drew comparisons to a vampire. A small ace tattoo adorned his cheekbone just below his right eye. His most striking feature was his mismatched eyes‚Äîthe left being metallic gray, the right emerald green. Luther, visibly intrigued, received notes and educated the viewers about heterochromia, the condition of having differently colored irises. Phineas, the adoptive son of Phoebos and Deimos Ellingboe, two notorious self-proclaimed psychic witches claiming ""dark magical"" powers. The two women were infamous in the district, many labelling them as charlatans and ""crackpots,"" yet their theatrical performances drew crowds. Adopted at the age of five, Phineas was said to possess a potent ""aura,"" leading the couple to believe he was the reincarnation of Ace Crown, a famed District 6 medic who treated both rebel and Capital patients during the Panemian War. Phineas exchanged a silent handshake with Linker and nodded to Mayor Rotom and Phoebe giving him a nod of encouragement which resulted in the boy quietly nodding before taking his place on stage. With little enthusiasm, Mayor Rotom offered his congratulations to the tributes and dismissed the assembly.

Petra received a visit from Mirabelle, Phoebe's daughter and arena baby conceived during the 3rd Hunger Games. As Petra's only friend, Mirabelle used her two minutes to offer advice. Petra, expressing gratitude for the concern, silenced her. Confident in her skills, Petra was determined to earn their district the honor it deserved and vowed to seek justice for their late friend Catalina, the runner-up in the 17th Hunger Games. Mirabelle expressed concern over Petra's overconfidence and urged her to collaborate with Phoebe. Petra agreed to listen to Phoebe but was reluctant to ally with her partner whom she referred to as a ""skeezy zombie."" Despite her frustration, Mirabelle reminded Petra she was a therapist and could help him. Petra rolled her eyes before proclaiming not for him resulting in Mirabelle hugging Petra and reminding her ‚Äúdon‚Äôt hold a grudge‚Äù.

Phineas received a visit from his mothers and two adopted brothers, Llewellyn and Tulsa. His mothers expressed worry about his reaping, fearing a curse from the gods. With his head in his hands, Phineas rolled his eyes, annoyed by their hysterics. He shared a knowing glance with his brothers before quieting his mothers. Although he confessed to feeling incredibly nervous, Phineas was more frustrated by their preoccupation with magic rather than offering practical advice and final goodbyes. Llewellyn and Tulsa encouraged him to collaborate closely with Phoebe and his partner. Tulsa emphasized the importance of using his gift. Phoebos and Deimos concurred, hopeful for his victory if he utilized his gift. Phoebos vowed to cast hexes on the other tributes, rummaging through her bag, while Deimos hugged him tearfully. Phoebos attempted to hand him a bag of dried blackthorn leaves, but was interrupted as peacekeepers stormed in, seizing the leaves and separating Phineas from Deimos's embrace. Phineas yelled his goodbyes as he was forcibly taken away.

As the pair boarded their hovercraft to the Capital, Petra was already lounging on the couch. Phineas walked in, and Petra snickered, ""You gonna cast a curse on me?"" Rolling his eyes, Phineas retorted, ""Like I've never heard that one before,"" and took a seat at the bar. ""Don't have your blackthorn leaves mama crackpot gave you, huh?"" Feeling annoyed, Phineas acknowledged his family's oddity and asked her to show respect. Petra, however, continued to mock him, targeting his appearance. Phineas, fists clenched in anger, was about to retaliate when a voice commanded, ""Shut your trap."" District 6 mentor Phoebe Bentley entered, looking weary, with a dinner cart pushed by avoxes. Petra hastily filled her plate, under Phoebe and Phineas's watchful eye. Phoebe, disappointed, told Petra, ""Cat wouldn't be happy with your behaviour, kid."" After a sigh from Petra, Phoebe offered them bubbly seltzer. Phineas accepted immediately, but Petra hesitated, wary of alcohol. Phoebe reassured her it was nonalcoholic, as per her usual protocol with tributes. Surprised it wasn't from the *Johnson Jazzy Juices* brand, Phineas learned from Phoebe that Bacchus hadn't yet released a nonalcoholic *Sappy Soda Seltzer*. He shrugged and began to fill his plate, Petra's gaze following every move.

Phoebe delivered her routine pregame rundown using a slideshow filled with pictures and statistics, covering topics such as pregame events, locating water sources, crafting makeshift weapons, and forming and managing alliances. Petra questioned the relevance of this in light of Head Gamemaker Cardew's recent preference for urban settings. Phineas speculated that they needed to anticipate various potential arena scenarios, like a zoo, for instance. Phoebe was skeptical about a zoo being used but praised Phineas for his open-mindedness. Petra rolled her eyes yet admitted the importance of setting aside time to brainstorm possible arena settings. As Phoebe attempted to steer the conversation forward, she caught Petra fixated on Phineas's heterochromatic eyes, musing over the rarity of such different colors in one's eyes. Phineas explained it as a genetic mutation he was born with, cutting off Petra's impending remark to reassure her of his perfect vision. Petra, half in disbelief and half irritated, sarcastically inquired if he had gleaned that from psychic abilities. Phoebe intervened, urging civility, and redirected the focus to the pregame preparations.

Petra planned to leverage her status as a fitness instructor and Phoebe's colleague to her advantage. Phoebe, though hesitant, ultimately gave in, yet she firmly rejected the notion of using Cat's name. On the topic of weaponry, Petra expressed a desire to wield a spear, which led Phoebe to consult Phineas. She anticipated he might employ his ""psychic talents"" but cautioned him against such declarations. Phineas acknowledged her advice, vowing to avoid any deception. Petra's laughter suggested it was due to the absence of his mothers' support. Observing Petra, Phineas inquired about an incident involving her right ear and scissors. The room fell silent, shocked by his insight. Phineas revealed his knowledge of Petra attempting to cut her hair with scissors and snipping her right ear instead, an incident dating back three years. Phoebe asked how he knew this. Phineas answered, ""The same way I know Petra's preference for other females. The one thing she hadn't teased me for was having two mothers."" Petra, incensed, yelled at him, denying his psychic claim. Phineas concurred, clarifying he never professed such abilities. Amidst their quarrel, Phoebe intervened by angrily yelling at them to stop, urging cooperation due to their unique intellect and expertise. Following a reluctant apology to Phineas, Petra retreated to the couch to watch the 21st Hunger Games. Phineas joined her, expressing sorrow over their district's slim chances. Petra disagreed, citing Cat's near-victory in the 17th Hunger Games as a benchmark for their district. Agreeing, Phineas noted their favourable prospects, given their avoidance of warmweed. Meanwhile, Phoebe, drained, remained at the bar, oblivious to her mentees' departure.

As the hovercraft glided over the Atlantic, Phineas woke up around 2 a.m. He appeared quite irritated by his premature awakening but proceeded to the bar carriage and served himself a *Lollipop Blossom*. Fortunately for him, he sipped the alcoholic beverage at a leisurely pace, just enough to stave off intoxication. Meanwhile, Phoebe also woke up, and upon seeing the boy sipping from his flask, she smiled and inquired, ""I hope that's the only one.""

Startled, Phineas dropped his drink on his foot, and as the avoxes hurried to clean up, Phoebe joined him in the carriage's living room area. She inquired if he wanted to watch a past game, but he huffily expressed a desire to return to bed. Phoebe then struck a deal with him: if they watched two games together, she would treat him and Petra to two *Johnson Jazzy Juices* of their choice, provided the meet-and-greet with the Capital citizens went smoothly. Although annoyed, he consented, prompting Phoebe to play the 3rd Hunger Games first. Phineas was particularly taken aback by these games, noting Phoebe's relationship with Kento and her less-than-well district partner. When Phineas questioned Phoebe about Carson, she casually remarked that ""he belonged in a psych ward."" Phineas chuckled before Phoebe proceeded to the 17th Hunger Games, where Cat was the runner-up.¬†

At that moment, Petra entered the room in search of a glass of water. She had intended to go back to her room, but the sight of Cat on the screen stopped her in her tracks. She decided to sit down with Phoebe and Phineas. Petra was misty-eyed as she watched Cat deeply converse with Mortimer before the climax. ‚ÄúShe always knew what to say‚Äù, she commented and Phoebe nodded. Petra asked her if she ever wished Cat won instead of ‚Äòfish boy‚Äô. Phoebe explained that she has felt exhausted and burnt out after over twenty years of mentoring and nothing to show for it. She still feels the loss of Cat not only because of their close relationship but how close District 6 was to another victor. Petra attributed District 6‚Äôs failure to the warmweed epidemic and wished the drug never existed.¬†

Phineas further inquired about the true victor of the games, Mortimer Beckett. Phoebe, with a smile, shared the extensive conversation they had at the Oakley Museum of the Hunger Games and considered him a good man deserving of his victory. She harboured no resentment towards Mortimer since Cat had willingly sacrificed herself for him to win. Petra questioned if she continued to provide him with warmweed for his SHC extraction experiments, while also researching warmweed‚Äôs detrimental effects. Phoebe affirmed their ongoing collaboration. Phineas was curious about their SHC extraction research, but received a gentle rebuff from Phoebe, who suggested with a smile, ""You might meet Mortimer at the Capital, but now it's bedtime."" Taking her cue, they bid their mentor goodnight.

Merely four hours later, the hoverjet landed in the Capital. Phoebe was absent, failing to awaken her tributes, as she was found unconscious at the bar, gripping an empty flask of mineral water. Luckily, Petra was already awake and getting dressed, and she succeeded in waking Phoebe. The disturbance awoke Phineas, who had been alert even before Petra began knocking on his door. While Petra gave Phoebe some coffee, Phineas appeared. Both women instantly perceived a transformation in him: his once long red hair was now woven into a single lengthy ponytail. Petra laughed, questioning how he could preserve his ""mystical aura"" with such a style. Phineas responded to ""watch and learn"" as he donned a layer of makeup to whiten his complexion followed by some dark, shimmering eyeshadow.

As the hoverjet commenced its descent, he remarked, ""Maybe it wouldn't hurt to put a little more effort into your appearance. My long hair is natural, unlike your extensions."" Petra shot him a look of mixed surprise and anger, while Phoebe observed the duo closely. Petra lifted her hand as though to slap Phineas but instead extended it in a gesture of unity, retorting sharply, ""I'm no more fashionable than you are."" The boy grinned and shook hands with his district partner, earning a smile from Phoebe. Upon landing at *Hamasaki Airport*, Phoebe embraced them both, advising them to ""simply be yourselves."" As the hovercraft's doors opened, eager Capital fans engulfed the tributes from District 6.

The airport saw a moderate increase in attendees due to the reaping, which showed that neither of the tributes were drug addicts. Petra won over the citizens of the Capital by taking photos with admiring girls and enamoured boys. She displayed her strength by lifting children into the air for more adventurous photos. When a sceptical man dared her to complete one hundred¬† push-ups, Petra agreed, on the condition he sponsor her in the games if she succeeded. He consented, and as Petra began, the crowd's gleeful anticipation turned to delighted surprise as she neared the target. Despite struggling with the last few, Petra triumphantly hit the one hundred mark. The crowd erupted in cheers as she rose and reminded the man of his promise to sponsor her on the first day. A journalist inquired about her fitness motivation, and Petra replied, ‚ÄúA sound body leads to a sound mind.‚Äù When asked about her unconventional partner, Petra admitted he was strange but expressed anticipation for an unexpected act from the psychic. Right then, a disturbance at the far end of the runway caught everyone's attention, and Petra's gaze followed as Phoebe hurried towards the commotion.

Phineas attracted a large crowd with his distinctive attire and heterochromatic eyes. As he struck poses for photographs, some requesting a stern gaze or an outstretched hand, numerous citizens of the Capital and a few journalists posed questions to him. Phineas addressed the rumours concerning his eyes, assuring everyone that he was neither colour nor vision impaired. An eager reporter named Plum Boleyn challenged him to demonstrate his psychic prowess before the crowd. Initially resistant, Phineas gave in as the crowd's chants grew louder. Closing his eyes, he feigned a trance. Moments later, he opened them and claimed to know Plum‚Äôs secret, causing Plum to blush as the audience gasped in shock. Phineas accused Plum of harbouring a severe alcohol addiction and cheating on his wife with a man. Plum, visibly shrunken, fled, seemingly confirming the accusation. The crowd surged forward, pleading for their own personal readings. As Phineas was about to select a young girl, he suddenly stopped, pinching the bridge of his nose. He collapsed to the floor, groaning in agony, hands clasped over his head. While some onlookers expressed concern, others mistook his pain for a prophetic vision. Phoebe dashed to his aid, helping the nearly unconscious boy to his feet and into a limousine, with Petra following behind, confused by the events.

During the limousine ride, Phoebe offered Phineas water and a painkiller. He accepted with gratitude but lamented how ineffective it would be. Petra inquired about his comment, prompting Phineas to admit that only warmweed or potent alcohol could alleviate his pain. Phoebe suspected stress or an overly enthusiastic citizen might have caused his discomfort, but Phineas dismissed these suggestions. Upon arriving at their destination and reaching the sixth floor, Phineas told them he had a chronic condition characterised by painful migraines, which impaired his other senses and caused fainting spells. He had suffered from this condition for as long as he could remember and had discovered that only warmweed or strong alcohol could ease the pain. 

Phoebe gently laid him on the sofa as Petra's bewilderment turned into disappointment. She was upset that Phineas had lied about his warmweed addiction, but he maintained that he had only microdosed to mitigate the pain without getting high. Amidst their argument, Phoebe retrieved an emergency pill box from her bag, placed half a pill in Phineas's mouth, and had him swallow it with water. Petra was taken aback to learn Phoebe carried warmweed pills but felt reassured when Phoebe explained they were for tributes who were so addicted that withdrawal symptoms could be life-threatening, using Birgit, the District 6 female tribute from the 16th Hunger Games, as an example.

Upon arriving at the apartment, District 6's stylist Morrana Cloudveil was updated on Phineas's condition after a warm reunion with Phoebe. After Sasha Grasseed's dismissal during the 17th Hunger Games, Morrana had risen in the fashion industry and earned the title of District 6's Hunger Games stylist. Petra welcomed Morrana and inquired about her acquaintance with Cat, whom she referred to as an old friend. Morrana nodded and said Cat was a kindhearted girl and credited her for her career success. When Phoebe asked about parade costumes, Morrana eagerly presented her concepts, revealing fabrics and sketches for a chemist costume that hinted at District 6's industry of alcohol production. Petra found the concept amusing, especially the thought of a muscular chemist. 

Turning to Phineas, she questioned Morrana on his costume, to which Morrana conceded some adjustments were needed due to his distinctive look. Phineas's interest peaked at the mention of modifications. Petra smirked, pointing out his tattoos and makeup, suggesting they might shatter the illusion, but Morrana saw potential in his makeup for a mad scientist persona. She declared her first step would be to cut his hair. Phineas questioned the need for a haircut, but Morrana outlined her plan for his attire. Meanwhile, Petra humorously cautioned that his hair might become a liability in the arena, quipping, ""The careers will drag you to your demise."" Understanding the reasoning, Phineas agreed to a haircut, resulting in short, untamed curls. Phoebe observed quietly as Morrana measured and fashioned the costume.

The parade was an ample opportunity for the Capital to catch a glimpse of every tribute representing their district. Behind the locked gates opening into the Avenue of Tributes, tributes, mentors and stylists entered to prepare for their big moment to show themselves off to the Capital. The District 6 entourage was one of the first groups to arrive, only after District 2 where their tributes were conversing with their mentors. Phoebe gave a friendly wave to Quarry Grounds (victor of the 12th Hunger Games) and Annabeth Walters (victor of the 22nd Hunger Games) as she passed. Phineas paused for a moment to Petra‚Äôs annoyance and asked the two victors when District 4 would arrive. Quarry claimed that Mortimer and Meridia Beckett (victors of the 17th and 18th Hunger Games respectively) would arrive very soon. His tributes Terra and Gunner (2) were silent during the brief exchange, the former finding Phineas‚Äôs makeup very strange. Petra chastised him for wanting a cut of SHC, reminding him it was an illegal substance for tributes. Phoebe corrected her, explaining that warmweed in its rawest form is banned but there are revisions being made for Hunger Games employees regarding the SHC component. Phineas simply wanted to pick his brain and ask him some questions.¬†

Morrana was inspecting their costumes and conversing with them about performance while more tributes began piling in. Petra felt sympathy for the scrawny Laozi (5), whispering to Phineas how she could‚Äôve whipped him into shape. Phineas was more concerned about the arrival of the District 4 entourage, oblivious to the snickers and pointed fingers of Carina and Bharat (10). Low and behold, the District 4 entourage did arrive behind the District 7 entourage. Before they began to settle themselves, Phoebe called Mortimer over while Meridia and Vixen Furtherson (victor of the 14th Hunger Games) were catching up and acquainting their tributes Fressa and Marsh (4) with Evelyn and Timber (7). Mortimer was gracious with Phineas and his multitude of questions concerning his work. 

Petra spent her time analysing the other tributes. She carefully watched the camaraderie between District 1 tributes Valencia and Ruggero (1), who all seemed to get along quite well with their mentors. She looked behind her to see Martin Bogota (victor of the 21st Hunger Games) struggle to console Fauna (11). However, she was most fascinated by the possible alliance brewing between Districts 4 and 7. She pointed out her observations to Phoebe, who expressed surprise by District 1‚Äôs decorum but not surprised by the other phenomenon. She claimed that Vixen and Meridia had tried to put their tributes together in the past with some sort of form of disagreement always happening. Petra thought it wise to attempt to insert herself in either camp, but wanted to wait until training to be sure. Phoebe considered an alliance a good idea, attributing her survival to her allies. Her face briefly fell upon saying this, but she lit up when Mortimer shook Phineas‚Äôs hand before returning to his wife and tributes.¬†

The horns were blown, signifying the start of the parade. The crowds cheered as District 1 came out of the tunnel first. Valencia and Ruggero (1) both brought life to their nightclub attire, performing sensual dance moves and catching flying roses. Surprisingly, District 2 didn‚Äôt give a strong performance despite very tasteful ancient gladiator costumes. Gunner (2) was the only one putting effort in his performance while Terra (2) stood still in the chariot. The other memorable district in the first five was District 4, where Fressa and Marsh (4) utilised their pirate and mermaid costumes respectively, very admirably. Marsh recovered greatly from flopping over, nearly falling out of the chariot. District 5 continued their reputation of lackluster parade performance with Laozi (5) punching Millicent (5) after she whispered to him to ‚ÄúDo something you shrimp‚Äù.¬†

The district many were intrigued to see was that of District 6. As their chariot became visible, Petra was already taking on the role of lead scientist. She flexed her muscles as she pretended to create a concoction using fake flasks Morrana gave her. Phineas was at first trying to stare down the audience with a menacing grin but when Petra started barking orders, Phineas decided to play along. He turned himself into a hunchback and pretended to get her materials. Petra was slowly becoming annoyed by the laughter and hit Phineas in the head with the fake flask. Phineas was stunned for a second but regained his composure. His eyes went wide and he began surveying the audience. Phineas pointed at one orange haired man and yelled at him to tell the lady next to him how he felt. Phineas switched his attention to a bald woman with a pink dress, ‚ÄúThat bald cap must itch real bad!‚Äù She was surprised for a second and took it off, revealing her short brown hair and confirming his statement. 

The chariots came to a stop before he could continue. As he was doing this, Petra looked to the other side of the aisle and began to silently mock Phineas by pressing her fingers at her temples, eyes closed, miming a psychic reading. Many found this funny and begged her for the fake flask. She obliged and threw one but it struck a Capital teenager in the face, garnering more laughter. When the parade concluded and President Walt gave his speech, the title for *Blanco Fashion Magazine‚Äôs Best Dressed* was awarded to District 1 for their affluent nightclub costumes and luscious performance.¬†

Back at the apartment for the District 6 tributes, Morrana and Phoebe both apologized for the sorry state of their tributes. Phineas had developed a bruise on his forehead courtesy of his earlier brawl with Petra. However, when Phoebe inquired about the bruise, Phineas glanced at Petra, who was raising her hand with a grin. Phineas then claimed, ""The wee lass nearly gave me a concussion when my hunchback act was getting us more sponsors."" Phoebe cast a disapproving glance at Petra, cautioning her about the potential repercussions of jeopardising their chances before the games even began, reminiscent of Dolly's tarnishing of District 11's reputation in the 19th Hunger Games. Petra felt it unfair that despite her best efforts, Phineas received all the praise, insisting she had barely touched him. Phoebe argued that his years performing in mystic shows with his mothers had prepared him well. Petra scoffed, claiming that Phineas' facade as a mystic wouldn't last since he was nothing but a fraud and an addict. Phoebe eyed him before muttering ‚Äúnot now don‚Äôt make me vivid with you now of all times‚Äù. 

A hurt Phineas defended himself, insisting he never lied about his migraines and his use of warmweed micro doses, questioning whether Petra had even seen his breakdown at the airport. Unconvinced, Petra retorted, ‚ÄúAt least I'm not pretending to be a psychic for attention.‚Äù Phineas shot back, ‚ÄúAt least I don‚Äôt conceal my bald patches with hair extensions. Has anyone told you that pulling out your hair is a bad habit?‚Äù 

Petra was visibly shocked, her wide eyes and open mouth betraying her. Her silence and trembling lip seemed to affirm his claim. In a swift reaction, Petra struck Phineas in the jaw, only to be subdued by a neck pinch from Morrana and dragged away to her quarters. Phoebe, overwhelmed with frustration, fell onto the couch and sighed in exasperation. Phineas attempted to apologize but Phoebe said aloud, ‚ÄúWhy must all my tributes be so difficult?‚Äù 

Phineas glumly withdrew to his quarters. Phoebe walked out the door of the apartment, putting Morrana in charge. She went downstairs to the District 4 apartment and knocked on the door. Mortimer answered but immediately knew she wanted to see Meridia. Phoebe let a few tears loose upon seeing Meridia. Meridia told her, ‚ÄúCome on girl, let‚Äôs have a fun girls night.‚Äù Mortimer promised to watch their tributes and the two women left the building. The two were given permission by peacekeepers to step out for a little while and went to the *Vergas Relax and Recharge Studio,* a spa/night bar strictly for Hunger Games employees.",2,1737162758.0,christianblanco,0,1.0,False

Anyways, heres some HCs I have crossposted from my Tumblr (with a few added on!)

Starting from the youngest to the oldest :]

‚Äî‚Äî

Zossie

Age: 10 (PLC), 11 (USUM), 14 (Alolarc)

Birthday: 3-18-2244

Family: Fyna (adoptive mother), Janae (adoptive mother), Dulse (adoptive older brother but not really her adoptive older brother???)

Orientation: Panromantic

- ÔªøÔªøZossie is a rookie, yet a prodigy when it comes to her duties. She's the youngest known Scout to date.
- ÔªøÔªøHer parents abandoned her as an infant on the doorstep of Ultra Corp, she was found by Phyco and was in his care until Fyna and Janae, being unable to summon a baby (that's a whole of worms I'll explain later), legally adopted her.
- ÔªøÔªøShe has diagnosed ADHD
- ÔªøÔªøDespite being very tiny and younger than all the other Ultra Academy students, she somehow managed to gain the respect of most of the other students, she's also pretty popular for becoming a Scout at such a young age
- ÔªøÔªøZossie is obsessed with ground type Ultra Beasts, explaining why she likes Diglett so much
- ÔªøÔªøIn my version of USUM, all four of the sillies go to Alola, she ends up befriending Elio/Selene, Hau, and Lillie, she became friends with Lillie during their adventure in rewritten USUM
- ÔªøÔªøShe eventually becomes a trainer, catching a Diglett, Alolan Raichu, and Togedemaru, she likes electric types
- ÔªøÔªøShe also makes friends with Acerola and Sophocles
- ÔªøÔªøZossie ended up replacing Tray in Team 14 after his death
- The reason her parents abandoned her is unclear, although it is speculated that they came from Downtown and didn‚Äôt want to raise a child in a gang
- She calls her two moms, Fyna ‚Äúamma‚Äù and Janae ‚Äúmayya‚Äù (equivalents of mama and mommy in Hulmaya)
- She had a name before being adopted, written on the crate she was left in, ‚ÄúCaeli‚Äù, Janae decided to give her a new name, Caeli remains her middle name
- Also Zossie is short for her real name, Zostera :)
- Knows how to make tons of different cafs (coffee equiv), thanks to Fyna running a caf√© out of their home, has been jokingly called Hebe the Drinkbearer by Team 14
- She was around 5 years old when Dulse (16 at the time) was taken in by Fyna and Janae, she immediately got attached
- When she came to Alola, she was put in charge of the Cosmog that was intended to fight Necrozma, Lillie calls it Nebby Jr.
- Unfortunately because of Cosmog being in her care, Zossie gets targetted by Faba‚Äôs subordinates as he wants to fight Necrozma himself and needs Cosmog to become a Solgaleo/ Lunala to do that
- She accompanies the player on their journey, becoming a rival, and also seeks advice from Burnet as the other URS members try to keep Cosmog safe from Faba and guide the player

Orientation: Biromantic Ace

- ÔªøÔªøHe gets his resting bitch face from his mother and his lack of emotes from his father, he is also autistic
- ÔªøÔªøHis childhood from 12-15 was pretty damn traumatic, he still has trouble processing it sometimes

- ÔªøÔªøThis man goes out in 90¬∞+ weather in a FUCKING HOODIE, HE DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO DRESS FOR THE WEATHER (he and Irida are twinning)
- He was diagnosed with autism at 3 years old, it wasn‚Äôt much of a surprise to his parents since his father had it. Most of his monotone attitude comes from that.

- Can‚Äôt STAND repetitive noises, especially pens clicking. Has had to storm out of the room a few times in class.

- Both he and Vycas take after their mother appearance wise
- He and Zossie are very siblinglike, even to the point others wonder if they‚Äôre actually brother and sister. 
- Mentioned in Soliera‚Äôs section, they were best friends in High School, however Dulse is on the recieving end on most of the teasing in their friendship, these mfs randomly go at each other like wild cats üò≠ They also have matching ear piercings too
- Deeply respects Phyco due to him rescuing both him and his brother as kids, the former is almost like his uncle
- Takes a break from the URS after adopting his Elvira (his second daughter) around him turning 30 (aka the mission where he beat a man to death out of anger for what he did to her), settles down in Unova with a partner, surprisingly, he has made a few friends as well. Skyla (randomly the extrovert adopting the introvert), Grusha (their vibes aligned), and he‚Äôs even encountered Piers a few times (emo bitches lmao)
- His son in the future becomes a SNOWBOARDER, likely inspired by Grusha.
- A bit overprotective of everyone he‚Äôs close to, even more so after Vycas almost died at the end of the PLC arc while saving a kid

Orientation: Sapphic Ace

- ÔªøÔªøYes. I HC her as Phyco's daughter.

realizing that she'll never change

- She was the first to ditch the suit in Alola, and even though she needed a ridiculous amount of sunblock and had to wear sunglasses and sleeves at all times, she was happy to be able to express herself
- Outside of Alola, she‚Äôs besties with Raihan (they had a battle and he was very impressed with her talent even though he beat her), Dendra (met through Tulip, share workout tips), and Perrin (the personalities aligned)
- She and Tulip‚Äôs first date was at one of the Galar Gym Challenge ‚Äúgames‚Äù, Tulip was not digging the atmosphere but Soliera was really into it (the next date and Tulip‚Äôs choice was a zen garden trip)
- She‚Äôs a TERRIBLE cook, the other three made the mistake of giving her a day in charge of dinner, the second the others took a bite, Phyco and Dulse both nearly fucking died of food poisoning while Zossie started crying (she was thankfully a few seconds late to dinner and showed up to the other two passed out)
- Somehow she knows a shitton of first aid after PLC, having been taught by Kat
- Does not trust Lusamine or anyone associated with Aether (other than Wicke, Lillie, and Gladion) whatsoever (kinda canon lmao), in the USUM rewrite, she hears about the Aether Scientists trying to take Zossie and Cosmog at the beginning of the game, and manages to catch them and beat the shit out of them
- Has scary attention to detail and remembers faces easily, if you mess with her friends and she catches a glimpse of your face, she will find you somehow, someday
- Has rare markings, while typical Megalopian markings are either freckle like dots, stripes, or ripples, she has markings that resemble the shape of flames
- Called ‚Äúsis‚Äù by Zossie, who has started to look up to her as a role model as she grows older
- She and Dulse are a bit more complicated? They‚Äôve been best friends since high school, and have reached the ‚Äúsibling-like‚Äù stage of their friendship where they argue and make fun of each other for no reason
- Phyco is her father, but even so, she still respects his title and calls him Captain and only really calls him ‚Äúdad‚Äù while off-duty
- Sometime after the Alolarc, she and Tulip have a daughter, Naomi, Tulip felt the effects of the DNA emission phase and both of them were so fucking dramatic about it, they literally had to go into Katy‚Äôs care until the egg spawned

I love my motorcycle more than I love most people (sorry, not sorry). When i'm not riding my motorcycle, i'm either traveling, gaming, or pretending I‚Äôm an extrovert with friends. 

I asked a librarian once if the library had any books on paranoia; she whispered, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre right behind you.‚Äù.... i hvn't visited a library eversince...ü§£ü§£ü§£fuckthat!

My first contact on the Hinge App was a scammer. I am new to the app and had several people like my profile and two women messaged me in a week period. I know at first they boost your profile so I wasn‚Äôt too surprised, except the messages because it‚Äôs not very common for me but has happened before. I can only deal with one person at a time so I message back the woman I was interested in. The first red flag was they asked for my number after a few days to meet for coffee when they were done working in a city 30 minutes away. They said they were an event planner so sounded plausible. The second red flag was they were using very generic ‚Äúhope you had good day‚Äù every morning around the same time. The text back was unemotional at best. Showed a picture of my very cute dog and barely a reaction. I started getting suspicious. Third red flag is I wanted have a phone call. They basically blew me off. After that I was like what am I doing‚Ä¶ I did a reverse image search on the images and found the scammer was using images from an Ethiopian influencer/artist with an open facebook account. Happily married with a husband and kids. Watch your ass out there people. 

What are some safety tips you have for the dating apps? For scams, meeting up with people in general? 

I will at very least look up their profile images to double check the person is who they say they are. And pay more attention if their profile is verified or not. ",6,1737162305.0,datingoverforty,14,0.8,False

The psychiatrist told me to start with 30mg for a week to get used to it and then switch to 60mg to see the therapeutic effects in about 3-4 weeks. Among other symptoms like bad ideations(...), I've been incredibly lazy and demotivated, dropping out of college, doomscrolling all day long and, if unregulated by other people, sleeping from 6am to around 5-7pm.
This morning I took the 30mg pill for the first time and after a coffee at launch, it kicked in and gave me some mild dizziness, nausea but especially extreme energy and at first even slight euphoria. I'm talking about mild shaking, widened eyes, barely able to sit still but nowhere to pour that energy on since I'm still unmotivated and can't bring myself in front of anything school or work related. Since I want to be completely honest with myself I also had a weird craving like feeling as if I wanted to take more to ""see what happens"". Of course I won't ever do it but it's scary since they told me it can't cause addiction or withdrawals when taken correctly but I'm still on my first half dose. I'm starting to even doubt I ever had depression cause I feel like it's impossible to claim it and still have this much energy. What if I was subconsciously faking it just to get 'legal drugs' since I've always wanted to know how it feels like to be high on different stuff? My mind is a total mess I know, but I can't stop wondering about everything at this point.

Most of the effects aside from the hyperactivity (which lasted for the entire duration) subdued within 4 hours of taking the pill and after about 12-13 hours I'm now coming off and feeling dizzy again. Is it normal? It's not even listed as a side effect so idk anymore. I know I shouldn't listen to ChatGPT but I asked to feel a bit better and it told me it's possible I dealt with depression for so long that I got used to the low numb mood and feeling more ""normal"" turned out to be overwhelming at first and that most likely there was some placebo effect going on with the fact I'm finally doing something to address my mental health and I had high expectations about this pill.

## Choosing the Right Yarn & Color ‚ÄçPalette

Selecting the correct yarn ‚Äåis paramount to crochet success, it will be the difference between a ‚Äågift that is ‚Å£admired and enjoyed‚Å§ to one that gets consigned to the back‚Å§ of the closet. This section explores the key differences and helpful suggestions when selecting yarn for your projects.

### Fiber Types: knowing the Basics

   **Natural‚Äç Fibers:**
       **Wool:** A classic choice, wool provides ‚Å£warmth, insulation, and ‚Äãdurability; perfect for beanies and scarves. Though, ‚Å£some people have sensitivity to wool, so you may ‚Äãneed to choose an choice.
       **Cotton:** ‚Äç Breathable and‚Å£ durable, cotton is ‚Äãgreat for projects like dishcloths, mug cozies, or lightweight summer scarves.
   ‚Å£
       **Linen:** Lightweight and strong, linen creates‚Å§ beautiful, drapey fabrics, ideal for scarves‚Å¢ and‚Å£ beach bags.
 **Synthetic Fibers**
       **Acrylic:** an affordable and widely ‚Å¢available option, acrylic ‚Äåis easy to ‚Å¢care for and comes in an extensive range of colors, making it practical for all‚Äç project types.
       **Polyester:** Known for it's strength and durability,polyester is often blended with other fibers to add longevity,and it is a good washable option.
       **blends:** Combining different fiber types can bring unique benefits, such as combining the softness of wool with the strength of nylon.

### What ‚Äçto ‚Å£Consider When Selecting Yarns

   **Purpose of ‚Äãthe‚Å¢ Gift:** The type of gift you are making‚Å£ will heavily influence yarn selection. Bulky warm yarns for blankets, lighter yarns for ‚Äãspring scarves.
   **Seasonality:** ‚ÄãChoose breathable materials in the summer and insulating‚Äç options in the winter.
   **Durability:** Items that get a lot of use (e.g., hats, cozies) should be made with durable‚Äç yarn that will withstand‚Äç wear and tear.
   **Ease of Care:** If the recipient prefers low-maintenance items, go for machine-washable fibers like acrylic, cotton, or blends.
   **Color Sensitivity:** Choose colors that‚Å£ are appropriate for the surroundings and that your father‚Äç would be open to wearing or using.
   **Heirloom Qualities:** For‚Äã items intended to become treasured heirlooms, focus on‚Å§ superior-quality natural fiber yarns.

### Color Palettes Tailored to Him

   **Neutral tones:** Classic colors like gray, navy, brown, and black are versatile and suit most men‚Äôs wardrobes perfectly.
   **Favorite Colors:** ‚ÄåIncorporating his favorite color (if he has one) adds a very‚Å¢ personalized touch to the gift.
   **Team Colors:** If he is a sports fan, use his favorite team's colors‚Äã for a themed present.
   **Vibrant Accents:** Pops of color can add personality to a gift without overshadowing ‚Å¢the overall aesthetic. The color can be ‚Äçworked into‚Å¢ the ‚Å£yarn as a texture or added as a color work design.
   **Color Considerations:** Avoid very radiant,‚Å¢ feminine palettes unless your ‚Äçfather's style‚Å¢ preferences are specifically aligned with these tones.

## Tips For Success: From Patterns to Presentation

making ‚Äçthe ‚Å¢project is only half the battle, from pattern selection to‚Å¢ final presentation you'll need to ‚Å¢carefully consider all the steps for success:

### Choosing the ‚ÄãRight Pattern

   **Skill Level:** Select a pattern appropriate for your current crochet capabilities. Don't ‚Å§be afraid to‚Å£ challenge yourself, however, starting small is a good method for success and to avoid frustration.
   **Pattern‚Å§ Clarity:** ‚Å¢Make sure the pattern‚Å£ is clear, well written, and readily available. Consider‚Å£ purchasing the pattern but there are‚Äç also many free patterns available for beginners to discover.
   **Gauge Check:** It is important to create a gauge swatch according to the instructions to ensure that the finished project is the ‚Å£right size.
   **Read Reviews:** Check reviews or comments about‚Äç a pattern to ensure it is suitable and correctly written.
   **Start Simple:** If you‚Äôre‚Å¢ a beginner, consider starting with a simple pattern like a beanie, scarf, or mug cozy before tackling a more complex project like a ‚Äãsweater.

### Creating the Perfect Presentation

   **personalize the Display:** Package the gift in a way that reflects his tastes ‚Å¢and adds a touch of‚Äã elegance.
   **Gift wrapping:** Even a simple wrapped gift indicates the thought and care you put into making the‚Äã crochet gift.
   **Add a Card:** A handwritten card explaining the amount of love that went into creating the gift will add sentimental ‚Äãvalue.
   **Add a‚Å§ Detail**: Consider‚Äç adding a small crochet detail as a ‚Å¢finishing touch. Perhaps a ‚Å§simple crochet heart or a small hand crocheted flower.
*   **Presentation is Key:** Presentation‚Äå matters as much as the gift. ‚Å£Even if you are gifting a blanket, consider a simple ribbon to wrap the gift and to make‚Äã it special.

My kid just turned 18. Senior in high school. She got her first job. A requirement was... within walking distance. I'm a single working mom. I can't always give her rides. And she doesn't have a license/car yet. 

Technically, it's within walk distance. Less than 30 minutes away. Sidewalks, streetlights, relatively safe area. And if I'm not available? She walks to work. 

The problem is when she's done. Anywhere between 9-10. I'm always home by then. So, I feel like an asshole if I don't pick her up and make her walk home instead. So far, I've picked her up every time. 

But I hate it. I work a very physically demanding job cleaning houses. I'm exhausted when I get home at night. As a single mom? I do everything. Cooking, cleaning, taxi service. Everything. When I get home at night? I freaking HATE going back out. And I'm tired by 8-9 o'clock. I drink coffee to stay awake. Then I'm up too late. Even more exhausted the next day. It's turned into a vicious cycle. 

Her sister worked the same job. She preferred walking home. But this one loves being picked up. It's 8pm on a Friday. Long ass week. I have a massive headache. All I want is to take something and go to sleep. But I'm sitting here waiting for another couple of hours and debating a cup of coffee. 

Am I an asshole for not wanting to pick her up? I honestly didn't want her to get a job because I knew it would be more work for me. I mean... I'm happy she wants to work, know it's a good thing for her, etc. That's all great. I just hate it for me. ",1,1737162035.0,AITAH,24,0.67,False
1i3vs9r,https://www.reddit.com/r/movingprofessionals/comments/1i3vs9r/the_5_lessons_i_learned_building_a_7figure/,The 5 Lessons I Learned Building a 7-Figure Service-Based Business,"Scaling a service-based business to 7 figures isn't easy (I own a moving company), but I did it (which means anyone should be able to!!), and it took me less than 2 years. I hope some of what I have to share can help you grow your own service based business!  
  
Here are the top five lessons that transformed everything for me:

1. **Build a Community** Success isn‚Äôt a solo journey. Surround yourself with people who are in the trenches with you, share insights, and lift each other up. Being part of a supportive community not only gave me new ideas but also kept me motivated on the hard days. When you grow together, you grow faster. To make this easier on yourself, join facebook groups, reddit forums, or even reach out to your competitors and take them out for coffee, you'd be surprised how many people are just looking for a good conversation! If you can't find any communities, build your own with integrity and watch as you all grow together.
2. **Obsess Over Customer Experience** A happy customer is honestly your best marketing tool (we often call them raving fans). Providing exceptional service not only brings repeat business but also turns clients into your biggest advocates. Little things like follow-ups, being genuinely helpful, and going above and beyond add up in a big way, it's not always about bottom line in the short run. One example I love sharing is a customer we had, let's call her Sarah, who we went so above and beyond for (a 3 man 6 hour move turned into a 4 man 12 hour move) has truly become a raving fan. She has referred us over $30k+ in revenue, one... single... client... treat everyone well, expecting nothing in return and your business is made to scale.
3. **Master Lead Generation** If your pipeline isn‚Äôt full, you‚Äôll always struggle. The sooner you nail down a system to attract consistent, high-quality leads, the sooner your business will stop feeling like an uphill battle. Experiment with what works best for you in your area, we found success to begin with 'doorhangers' and plastering these around the local neighborhood, of course we moved away from this as we scaled, but be creative and see what works best for you!
4. **Outsource Early** It‚Äôs tempting to do it all yourself, but you‚Äôll burn out fast. Focus on what you‚Äôre great at and outsource the rest. It‚Äôs scary at first, but letting go of tasks that aren‚Äôt in your wheelhouse is one of the best moves you can make to scale. Let me say it again, OUTSOURCE EARLY, we all have the fear of letting go of our business, assuming we know what's best (little secret, we often don't!), put your pride to the side, let other people do what you can't and free up time for you to focus on the most important parts of the business!
5. **Learn to Say NO (after 6 months!)** Not all business is good business. Learning to turn away clients who aren‚Äôt the right fit saved me countless headaches and allowed me to focus on opportunities that actually moved the needle. This point comes with a caveat, during your first 6 months, don't turn away any business, you'll learn a lot from the bad ones and know not to repeat the same mistakes in the future and tell tale signs of a difficult customer.

Hi, I'm a 35 year-old nerdy guy living in New England. And yes, I made a dating site for myself.

I enjoy conventions, video games, cosplaying, etc. Outside of my cosplay I have a great taste in fashion. I also like to work out to keep in shape and stay healthy. In my spare time I fill out sweepstakes and enter raffles (that I often win!).

I am looking for a woman who I can travel, cosplay(not required), geek out with and eventually share a life with. But for now a coffee, if local, would be great.

I have yet to buy any furniture for it, and I‚Äôm trying to figure out the ideal fung shui for everything first before I start to actually make purchases.

I drew the attached schematic of my apartment with as many measurements as I could get in order to help visualize this.

In an ideal world, I would think that the wall that has the balcony on it makes the most sense to put the couch up against, but obviously I can‚Äôt do that.

I could try to put the couch up against the adjacent wall that is directly opposite the kitchen, but I fear that it would block the entry walk way and also would be misaligned with the fire place (to me it makes logical sense that a couch would be centered facing the fireplace, but idk).

I could also try to bring the couch and the accompanying coffee table or side table with it closer to the center and not put it against a wall, in order to preserve a walkway that goes around the outer edges of the two sides of the living room that connect the kitchen, balcony and entry way, but that would essentially shrink the size of my living room.

If youre feeling the same about your current machine and curious about buying a failr 58, hopefully my review will give you better insight. After seeing the the extra benefit of flow profiling, I wanted to be able to have a machine that could do this. After doing research, I came to find out that the flow control on most machines is very privative. Instead of controlling the flow rate at the pump, 99.9% of machines just control pressure through creating a smaller or bigger channel for water to flow. This seemed lame and a not very well built design. Now while you can buy a rotatory machine and mod it to control the flow rate, I was kind of burnt out owning a a giant espresso machine. If and when something breaks, its a pain in the neck trouble shooting what died. While I loved my isomac tea, my flair 58 plus blows it out of the water. 

Now time for the review, after owning it for 5 months, here are the pros and cons I've come to find. 

Pros: 

\- very little things to break. you have one electrical component that may go out. But its easy to diagnose. if brew chamber isn't heating, you know your issue. 

\- flow profiling. you can mess with so many ranges of pressure to see what works best for that type of coffee (this is the expensive part). 

\- counter top profile is minimal. 

\- fast heating time. It takes roughly 3mins to heat up to the second light. The kettle is the thing that takes the longest to get to temp. 

\- the mechanism is overall a good setup. the force transfer to the chamber through the linkage is a pretty sold setup. 

cons: 

\- appeal. depending on your kitchen style, a shiny chrome machine will almost always look better than a matte black thing on the counter. 

\- you will have to learn with this machine. But thanks to youtube, there are plenty of people who explain how this machine and its concepts operate. 

\- You NEED a good quality grinder. My baratza vario does an amazing job at being able to grind fine enough for this while still being able to switch to filter. 

\- This machine doesnt have a traditional group head screen like other machines. So you have the option of using a puck screen. I say option because you can pull a shot without the puck screen but I have found that you're at greater risk of channeling and grinds getting pushed back up into the chamber. 

\- for some odd reason, this machine is more prone to shots that spray. It only happens every once's in a while. But sometimes, shots do spray.

She apologized again and said she feels like she‚Äôs walking on eggshells all the time because she‚Äôs afraid people will react badly. Then she asked me not to tell anyone... All this over a CC üôÑ

Honestly, after 15 months of this, I‚Äôve really started wondering if she just doesn‚Äôt get how office/social stuff works.

First incident (months ago):
Isa thought she was getting too many emails and being CC‚Äôd unnecessarily. Instead of just talking to the person directly, she emailed 2 project managers, CC‚Äôd me, and their boss.
It ended badly. I straight-up told her, ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you just talk to the person directly?‚Äù
And to make things worse, those project managers were new.

100 incidents later, yesterday:

Isa was copied on an email (about a project that has absolutely nothing to do with her). The client was just following up with the project manager. Isa calls her boss and says, ‚ÄúI think Rosalia is having problems with her projects.‚Äù
Rosalia told me about it because I‚Äôm working on that project with her, and she was super upset.

I think something‚Äôs going to happen in the next 2 weeks. Isa already has several complaints against her, and she knows that if HR and the director meet with her again, she‚Äôs out.

I honestly don‚Äôt know if she‚Äôs doing this stuff on purpose or what. I‚Äôve told her so many times, ‚ÄúJust talk to the person first. Don‚Äôt go straight to the bosses.‚Äù If that doesn‚Äôt work, then go higher up.

This is her first job in the country since she was a student, so maybe that‚Äôs part of it, but... I don‚Äôt know.

Anyway, Thursdays and Fridays she isn't in the office, and honestly? I‚Äôm so relieved.

* Grinder: [Kingrinder K6](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09WH9JKY1)
* Flair: Classic w/ [pressure gauge add-on](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07N45CS8T)
* Scale: [Weightman](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08CDRBJD6)
* Tamper: [Boicafe](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09FPPLVK4)
* WDT: [Tiverain](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSFFHM3Y)
* Beans: [El Injerto Malawi Gesha from Elixr](https://elixrcoffee.com/collections/elixr/products/el-injerto-geisha-reserve-8oz)

Workflow:

1. Weigh 15g of beans
2. Grind at 38 clicks (2 clicks finer than the 40 mark, going counterclockwise from the ""zero point"" where it won't spin anymore). Sandy texture with minimal clumpage
3. Boil some water, preheat the Flair's chamber for ~30 sec after boiled
4. Pull a shot at ~6-8 bar for 25-30 sec, getting 28-33g out (fluctuates as I experiment) and lowering the Flair's lever most or all of the way
5. Taste and then mix into whatever milk drink I feel like

Espresso profile:

* Consistently present but minimal crema, usually around 2mm (~1/16th of the cup) layer at the top of the shot glass

* Some sharp-ish acidity, less-so as I've gotten my pressure right once I got the gauge but still distracts a lot from the actual coffee taste

* A tiny bit of the tastes described by Elixr for this blend but mostly just acidic and bitter

Notes:

* When I tamp the puck, I think I'm applying around 30lbs of pressure? I definitely press fairly hard and can feel the ""crunch"" of the grounds compressing. Also appears quite flat, and when I press lighter I get a tiny bit of coming up through the filter and turning the water in the chamber light brow. There's also 8-10mm of empty space above the puck after tamping

Happy to provide pics and any additional details!",2,1737160753.0,FlairEspresso,12,1.0,False

I'd love to meet someone who's looking for chats, gaming or in the small chance we're local(wi), a beer or coffee.  Im a gay man in a relationship and I'm only looking for platonic chats. 

Some of my interests include

I love food.  I like to cook and try new food.  What's the best thing you've tried recently? 

I like to game. How much I game usually depends on my free time. I have a PS5 and lately been into fortnite and marvel rivals.  Recently got into DND and board gaming as well.  

I like to read. Mostly sci Fi and fantasy. 

I also enjoy outdoorsy activities like hiking with our two huskys, foraging and gardening  

Love going to breweries and trying new beer

Music - some of my favorites are, sleep token, tender, bad omens, suicide bois, purity ring and bmth

The old girl goes into her crate bed for solitude, so meathead lays down in front of the door just staring at her. No way she can get out without him moving. Classic sibling type 'I'm not touching you stuff' This is all happening whilst I'm making morning coffee mind.
