1q7acno,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1q7acno/should_i_break_up_with_my_boyfriend/,Should I break up with my boyfriend?,"I (21f) am in a relationship with my boyfriend (22m) for 2,5 years. I'm thinking about breaking up, but it's really hard to decide. We always had love and understanding for each other, but there were always things that weren't perfect, about which we argued. I am really responsible, I like order, being reliable, being productive, overall active and proactive. Making positive change on myself and doing new things etc. He is a really good person, he is super calm and understanding, he is really smart, charismatic and overall I am proud to be with him. But he is not so responsible. He has a bad memory, he always forgets his promises, he forgets stories that i told him that are important to me, he always procrastinates on everything, even if the thing he said he'll do is his idea. He is living a slow life, always drinking his coffee in cafés for long hours. Never inviting me and making ides for fun dates, that aren't being in café or in his room. So when we traveled to different places, where we tried new and fun things, our relationship was so much better. I had higher libido, which regularly disappoints. He always has high libido and is always ready to make love, while i am not. I need a lot of foreplay and recently i realised that his passive and unresponsible behaviour made my libido go down. I took the responsibility to work on it and fix it, i read books, took a course, visited therapist. And he always said that we'll stay together as long as he sees me trying to fix the issue we have. If I give up and the issue is still there, the relationship will end.

He is the person who usually understands me so well, and he was ready to try to change the things that bothered me as they are objectively not so good for himself either, but recently i feel like he stopped trying. He doesn't want to work on that anymore. He even doesn't apologise when he brakes his word, he just says it's not his fault, his brain works that way. (e.g. He said he'll call me to chat (we haven't seen each other in few days) in 10 minutes, after he finishes a game, then 2 hours later he calls and asks me why didn't i remind him, tells me that he goes out now and can't talk. He got lost in his game, lost sense of time, and ultimately didn't call me for 2 hours. He didn't apologise because his brain simply works like that and it's not his fault. And for him it's too much effort to sat an alarm.) Thats one example, i have a ton of these. I can't accept this kind of behaviour, but I can't just let him go either. I love him and he loves me. We deeply care for one another. We discussed our future together, we wanted to get married one day and have kids. But now it all seems to be falling apart and i feel like I'm loosing part of myself and my future with loosing him. I feel like I'll never find love this deep and I don't want to be alone forever. Now we are in out hometowns for holidays, this Sunday we'll be back in the city where we study and we will talk about this. If he wants to break up too, it'll be easier. 

  
Tldr I don't know weather I should brake up with my boyfriend. We love each other and have a healthy relationship, but he is not responsible which is bothering me. ",1,1767874780.0,relationships,1,1.0,False

Hey everyone! ☕️

Whether you just landed at Kempegowda Airport with three suitcases and zero idea where to stay, or you’ve been living here so long you actually understand the ""Silk Board"" memes—welcome home.

This community was created for one simple reason: Bangalore is better together. We know the city can be overwhelming (and expensive!), so this is your safe space to share, ask, and connect.

What can you post here? Honestly, ANYTHING Bangalore-related:

• 🏠 Housing & Rent: Stressed about 10-month deposits? Looking for a flatmate in HSR or a PG in Indiranagar? Ask away.

• 🎓 College & Work: From survival tips for freshers to ranting about that one toxic manager in Manyata Tech Park—we’re listening.

• 🍛 Food & Nightlife: Where’s the best vada? Which brewery actually has good music? Share your hidden gems.

• 🚗 Travel & Commute: Need to know the best time to catch a Rapido? Or a weekend getaway from the city? We’ve got the hacks.

• 🤝 Making Friends: Moving to a new city is lonely. Post here if you want to find a badminton partner, a book club, or just someone to grab a coffee with.

• 💬 The Random Stuff: Spotted a weird billboard? Want to share a sunset photo from your balcony? Found a dog that needs a home? Post it!

The Only Rules:

1. Be Kind: We’re here to help, not hate.

2. No Gatekeeping: If someone asks a ""dumb"" question about the Metro, help them out. We were all new once.

3. No Spam: Keep it real, keep it local.

1q7a9o0,https://www.reddit.com/r/writingthruit/comments/1q7a9o0/blocked_still/,Blocked Still?,"## Writer's Block? More Like Writer's *Bleh*. Let's Fix This:

**Feeling uninspired? Procrastinating like a panda on a treadmill? Fear not, fellow wordsmith! Let's outsmart this block with ninja tactics:**

**Environment Hacks:**

* **Shower Epiphany:** Write steamy scenes (figuratively, please) in the shower. Guaranteed inspiration (or at least clean ideas).
* **Nature Nudge:** Write under a tree, feeling the breeze whisper secrets (or scold you for slacking).
* **Coffee Catastrophe:** Spill coffee on your manuscript? Panic, then laugh, then write about it. Bonus points for caffeine-fueled creativity.

**Spark Your Inner Weirdo:**

* **Automatic Writing:** Set a timer, close your eyes, and let your subconscious scribble. Prepare for hilarious nonsense or hidden gems.
* **Cut-Up Chaos:** Chop up quotes, headlines, or song lyrics, then Frankenstein them into a bizarre story.
* **Dream Diary Delusion:** Record your dreams, even the nonsensical ones. They're like free story prompts from your subconscious.
* **Random Object Roulette:** Spin a pen, point at your bookshelf, write a story about the book it lands on. Embrace the chaos!

**Challenge Your Inner Critic (Shut it Up):**

* **Write the Worst:** Write the absolute worst scene imaginable. You'll be so embarrassed, you'll write something good to redeem yourself.
* **Cliché Challenge:** Write a scene using every writing cliché in the book. Then rewrite it, destroying clichés with your brilliance.
* **Mirror, Mirror:** Stare into the mirror and have a deep conversation with your reflection about your story. Bonus points for dramatic monologues.
* **Future You Fury:** Imagine your future self, successful and published, berating you for procrastinating. Write a scene about their disappointment.

**Bonus Tip:** Reward yourself with something ridiculous for every completed scene. Like a dance party to the Macarena or wearing a lampshade as a hat. Embrace the absurdity!

Remember, writer's block is just a temporary hurdle. With a little wit and these offbeat techniques, you'll be back to churning out words like a caffeinated squirrel on a sugar rush. Now go forth and conquer that blank page! (And maybe wear a lampshade for good luck.)",1,1767874518.0,writingthruit,0,1.0,False

1q7a9ds,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1q7a9ds/are_these_instances_of_gas_lighting_or_am_i_just/,Are these instances of gas lighting or am I just sensitive.,"As per title really.

Instance 1:

Was supposed to meet an old flame for a date last year, at one point. She text me say a week before, asked me out. We agreed to meet the next Wednesday morning. As it was about a week/five days away.. we continued to text for a little bit.

There was a lull of maybe 24/36 hours 2 days before the date.. I text the evening before to check if she was still up for meeting in the morning..

She responded with ""I didn't hear from you, so I booked a nail appointment"".

I identified it immediately as total gas lighting / red flag behaviour and said not dealing with people like that.

I say it's gas lighting because I could have walked away questioning myself and kicking myself for not following up sooner. But no, lines of communication were open, we had agreed and I followed up to confirm. The timelines were completely valid in my opinion.

Instance 2:

A cousin lives away from our home town and was returning over the Christmas. I had spoken to him a week before Xmas and had suggested meeting up, he said yea.. let's do coffee, I said fine.

Fast forward.. he is in town for xmas. I didn't want to be calling him, as I called him the last time and didn't want to be badgering him if he didn't actually want to meet up (I've had this before with others).. and he had his wife and child in town also, so is busy. He has acted standoffish over the last couple of years, so I assume we have drifted and he doesn't actually fancy meeting. fine.

I don't hear from him over xmas when he is in town (but I know from others that he is doing the rounds and meeting/visiting others).. but when he leaves town and get's back to his home he messages saying it was a pity we didn't get to meet up over xmas... and (get this) had I any plans to come and visit his town (so we could meet there)..

I follow up and he says he ""was expecting me to call him"".

I kind of see red at this point.. because honestly he tried the same stuff last xmas.. and challenged me to go visit him. Which I did. I drove 3 hours round trip to visit him for lunch in the interest of friendship etc. Then he has the audacity to intimate that I come and visit him in his city again... while he didn't even bother to pay me a visit for even a coffee when he was in town.

At this point I get it that he doesn't value me a lot... but why does he still reach out and talk about meeting up when he could easily say nothing.

This might strictly not be gas lighting but I find this kind of manipulating and messing about very stressful and really messes with peoples heads.

I have dealt with a narcissist father over the years and am only beginning to realise how damaging manipulative behaviour can be when it comes from people you care about.

P.S. Please please please don't comment that these are communication issues. I communicated just fine in both these circumstances.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )

1q7a7w8,https://www.reddit.com/r/zr2/comments/1q7a7w8/are_you_searching_what_is_aim_of_life/,are you searching what is aim of life ?,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Hello and welcome to DevBlog #76! We're back from the holidays and this devblog will be longer and a bit different than usual. As WalkScape's Closed Beta started on 18th of January, 2024, we'll take a look back to the last year and what's been done, and also cover what we're hoping for this year. Let's get started!

# WalkScape in 2025

**Engine Rework, Gear Sets, January 2025**

[DevBlog #53](https://www.reddit.com/r/WalkScape/comments/1i84ymf/devblog_53_engine_rework_launch_announcement_and/)

The year started off with a big update to the game's engine. Most of the engine was rewritten, and we made the game's logic work in a separate library, so game logic could be more easily be shared with servers and development tools for the game.

This was a much needed update to pay off a large amount of technical debt that we had accumulated and to make development of new features much more straight forward.

With this update, we also shipped the Gear Sets feature to the game.

**Devtools 2.0, March 2025**

[DevBlog #56](https://www.reddit.com/r/WalkScape/comments/1j4x1wy/devblog_56_announcement_on_new_skill_content/)

To make content development to the game easier, we built what we called ""Devtools 2.0"". Previously, creating content was through in-game devtools that weren't as great for creating content quickly. New Devtools have also been developed quite significantly since that whenever needed, and made it so that the content development requires little to no development work unless there are new features needed to be added.

**Trinketry skill added, March 2025**

[DevBlog #56](https://www.reddit.com/r/WalkScape/comments/1j4x1wy/devblog_56_announcement_on_new_skill_content/)

Trinketry skill was added to the game, bringing the total number of skills up to 10. This also came with new services, pretty much complete rework of amulets & rings in the game, and with trinket materials being added to the game.

**iOS Smart Watch support, April 2025**

[DevUpdate #22](https://www.reddit.com/r/WalkScape/comments/1k7j4tv/devupdate_22_releasing_ios_smart_watch_support/)

We added support for smart watches on iOS. This also came with new UIs for language selection, improved localization support, new content, improved in-game settings and much more. We used the earlier implementation of iOS smart watch support as a way to prepare for Android smart watch support, which was much more complex to implement.

**Bogged Down update, May 2025**

[DevBlog #61](https://www.reddit.com/r/WalkScape/comments/1kn689e/devblog_61_wave_4_starts_now_bogged_down_update/)

This update came with changes to how the Wave system works for the game, and 4 new locations adding a new sub-region to the game: the Swamp area. We also started Wave 4, after which we did changes to the supporter pricing and closed beta access in order to be able to hire an additional developer.

**Adventurers' Guild update, New Players update, June 2025**

[DevBlog #63](https://www.reddit.com/r/WalkScape/comments/1l9oicr/devblog_63_another_update_going_live_today_new/)

These updates added new content, balancing and general improvements to help new players and make the Adventurers' Guild feel better. We also did quite a lot of bug fixing, especially related to steps graphs during this time.

**Travel +1 Update, July 2025**

[DevBlog #64](https://www.reddit.com/r/WalkScape/comments/1ll6mo7/devblog_64_travel_1_and_rumours/)

This update added rumors mechanic and we did a major server rework, which had been started at least a month prior. The main new thing was adding Travel +1 mechanic and reworking the way activities work in the game entirely, so we could support different & more varied types of activities in the future.

**Faction chest update, QoL, in-game announcements, August 2025**

[DevBlog #67](https://www.reddit.com/r/WalkScape/comments/1mwhjhg/devblog_67_new_update_info_and_what_were_working/)

We did a big rework on faction jobs, chests, added repeating rewards for factions. In this update we also added in-game announcements and bunch of QoL related features, such as a new way to browse jobs in the game.

**Android Smart Watch support, September 2025**

[DevBlog #69](https://www.reddit.com/r/WalkScape/comments/1nk7l0k/devblog_69_android_wearables_release_and_content/)

After we had the iOS Smart Watch support working nicely, we started the work on Android Smart Watch support. We did a special implementation for Samsung devices, and added support for other devices through Health Connect. This update was also accompanied with a bunch of fixes, new content and balancing changes.

**QoL & OTA update, November 2025**

[DevBlog #73](https://www.reddit.com/r/WalkScape/comments/1ow1h96/devblog_73_more_qol_changes_bug_fixes_and_ota/)

For this update, we reworked how abilities are displayed and how they work in the game, and added that they can have multiple charges. We also added a new OTA system, so content team can easily deploy newly created content & fixes through a separate tool, including new localizations.

This update also included a bunch of QoL changes, like reordering Gear Sets, sorting inventory, Work Efficiency breakdown in activity view, and much more.

**Going South Update, December 2025**

[DevBlog #75](https://www.reddit.com/r/WalkScape/comments/1pk7asl/devblog_75_content_update_releasing_next_week_and/)

We added new features such as input acitivites, limited activities, Mysterious Merchant and Pets to the game. This was also the biggest content update of the year, adding two new regions to the game with new higher-level activities.

During December, we also started the hiring process for third developer to the team.

# Looking back at 2025

[Another new location art piece](https://preview.redd.it/0eqx4fcd94cg1.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=bea0e051fa9ed1bcf4083a84c321e61eb6ce2ce8)

During 2025, we almost managed to release one new major update each month while also having full-length Summer & holiday season vacations. And this doesn't count for dozens of minor updates and hotfixes we've released as well. We also had a significant change in the content team during this year. And this doesn't count for everything we've done in the background that isn't visible to the players, such as:

* We've added two new servers, with third one for OTA updates coming soon
* Major improvements on our server infrastructure, server alerts and server monitoring
* Anti-cheat systems have been improved significantly, even with the added complexity of smart watches
* Moved to a new bigger office!
* Started hiring for 3rd developer
* Most of the AI generated art has been replaced with isometric art handcrafted by maxchill

During 2024, we released three major updates to the game (Achievements & Consumables update, Syrenthia update, Major QoL update with new UI etc.). A lot of the first half of 2024 was spent on working to make the Android pedometer work properly, and during that time there was just me working on the game. In 2025, with the addition of myzozoz to the team and improving our pipelines, planning and meetings, we've sped up the development quite a lot.

# What is our plan for 2026

For 2026, we're planning to increase our development speed even more and we've already shifted our focus to tackle the remaining big features for Open Beta launch. With the content creation pipeline now being in good shape, we are also planning to keep pushing out content frequently while working on the large remaining features for Open Beta.

Myzozoz has been working on prerequisites for the trading system, with the OTA being the first one that needed to be done, and we're working on the trading system constantly. In total, it's a very complex system with a lot of things we need to implement with as much care as possible, which is why it's also very time consuming. With just two developers, it's been quite a massive feature to work on, especially as we both often need to work on other things as well. Hopefully with a new developer focusing on the bigger features would become a bit more easy.

Meanwhile, I'm also working on some bigger features. I'll be sharing what those are later once they're closer to completion, and as usual, we'll be sharing more of our plans & upcoming features once they're nearer to their release.

# Hiring process

In December, we started looking for third developer to the team. We had already moved to a bigger office so we have space for more people. Hiring is quite a time consuming effort, but it'll be done before the end of January. We have already interviewed one candidate in person, and we'll have around five more interviews before the end of the month.

The changes we did to the Wave system and pricing back in 8th of June, 2025 has enabled us to hire a third developer to the team. We stated in [DevBlog #60](https://www.reddit.com/r/WalkScape/comments/1kc70w3/devblog_60_wave_4_launch_date_changes_to_new/) that if we could increase our revenue from $12k-ish per month to $17k (after taxes, currency exchanges and platform fees) we would have enough revenue to hire a third full-time developer. We reached this goal around November. Changes in the exchange rate of US$ to Euro did initially hurt us pretty badly (making the original $17k goal way too low), but since that we've managed to increase the revenue slowly. Also, Patreon recently added their own payout system to their service, which made us able to ditch PayPal, lowering the fees & currency conversion costs a bit.

If you haven't supported us so yet and enjoy the game, consider supporting us on [Patreon](https://patreon.com/WalkScape) or [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/walkscape)! Every new supporter helps us to grow and without all of this support, we wouldn't have been able to increase our development team size or buy all of these new servers we have. So huge thanks for all of the existing supporters!

Due to the hiring taking a lot of our time for the time being, there likely won't be any big update to the game in January. But as we saw with myzozoz being hired to the team, bringing a third developer to the team will after a few months speed up our development efforts significantly. And I can say that we have some really promising candidates applying to the team!

Once we've made the decision on who to hire, they'll likely introduce themself in one of the devblogs, hopefully in February once this process should be already completed.

# Happy new year 2026!

Alrighty, that's all for today!

I wish you all a happy new year 2026! I'm really excited with the coming year for WalkScape, as we're again able to scale our team and efforts even further. And I'm happy with all that we managed to do in 2025. We've been constantly improving and we're able to deliver faster, and I'm dedicated to keep it that way. For 2026, we hope this year to be even better than 2025!

The original design has an area with cabinets for the pantry near the door. We thought of a corner one (on the top right corner, near the sink) or a separate walk-in pantry on the other side (transforming the peninsula into an island.) Maybe a coffee corner beside it would be cool.

I'm shy and more of an introvert and for the longest time, I've always clicked more with women older than me wether during my work or outside in my activities, most of them often siad I was a ""nice charming man"".

For some of them I had a ""thing"" but I never had the courage to ask any of them even for a simple coffee, cause after all, I'm completely inexperienced ; I'm short and not your typical ""Jock"".

But as that attraction for older women does not seem to change, nor the fact that I'm meeting more older women than women my age, I guess my question is, what are the kind of expectations for ""cubs"" when it comes to experience ; attractiveness and mind behaviour.

I want to use 'peoper' filters, for V60 I've really enjoyed cafec abaca.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

Some of it worked. Some of it didn’t stick.

But Deep Work was new to me. I had never really tried working in complete focus, without distractions. And once I did, it hit differently.

The more I read about it, the more I realised that Deep Work is actually one of the rarest and most effective ways to be productive. And when you look at people like Mark Twain, J.K. Rowling, or Bill Gates, they all isolated themselves to think and work deeply. No noise. No distractions. Just focus.

Cal Newport defines Deep Work as working in a distraction-free way that pushes your brain to its limit and creates real value. On the other hand, most of what we do daily emails, scrolling, organising, is shallow work.

What’s interesting is that intense focus actually trains your brain. Neuroscience shows that deep focus strengthens neural connections, making you faster and sharper over time.

Deep Work works best when you have structure: a fixed place, a fixed time, a simple starting routine, and some mental support (like coffee, music, or water). You also need to schedule distractions instead of letting them interrupt you all day.

The goal isn’t to work all day. It’s to work deeply for a few hours and let that do the heavy lifting. Basically, Deep Work isn’t about doing more.  
It’s about doing less, but better.",6,1767873540.0,GetMotivated,2,0.88,False

    1. ¿Este garabato te representa COMO DEV? ¿O es solo un dibujo random?
    2. ¿Le veis sentido al concepto o es postureo indie hacker?
    3. ¿Pagariais ~29€ por algo así? (sé sincero, no me ofendo)
    
    Importante: Esto NO es un anuncio. Es un ""oye, tengo esta idea loca, ¿tiene sentido o la tiro?"".
    
    Si la respuesta es ""tíralo"", perfecto, he aprendido.
    Si la respuesta es ""sigue"", pues seguimos.

1q79u1p,https://www.reddit.com/r/IHScout/comments/1q79u1p/where_is_ultimate_perfection_of_life/,where is ultimate perfection of life ?,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1q79ry5,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheImprovementRoom/comments/1q79ry5/my_grandfathers_5word_response_when_i_was/,My grandfather's 5-word response when I was disrespected changed how I view masculinity forever,"I was 19 when I first truly understood what respect means for a man. I had just started my first real job at a construction company, eager to prove myself among men twice my age with callused hands and weathered faces.

Three weeks in, I was the target of relentless comments from one of the senior workers Mike. He'd mock my technique, laugh when I struggled with heavy materials, and make jokes at my expense in front of the crew. Every day, I'd come home feeling smaller, the humiliation burning in my chest.

I remember sitting at my grandfather's kitchen table that Sunday, a man who had worked with his hands his entire life. After listening to me vent for ten minutes about the disrespect and my plans for an aggressive confrontation, he set down his coffee cup and looked me straight in the eyes.

""Respect is taken, not given,"" he said.

Those five words hung in the air between us. I waited for him to continue, to explain some elaborate plan for standing up to Mike, maybe even something physical. But he just sipped his coffee and let the silence stretch.

""What does that even mean?"" I finally asked.

""It means you're looking at this all wrong,"" he replied. ""You're waiting for him to hand you respect like it's something he owes you. But respect doesn't work that way, especially among men.""

He explained that I had two options: demand respect through confrontation, which might work temporarily but would position me as someone easily rattled; or command respect through my actions, which would change how people fundamentally saw me.

The next day, I arrived at the site thirty minutes early. When Mike started in with his usual comments, instead of showing frustration or firing back, I simply looked at him, nodded slightly, and returned to my work with deliberate focus.

At lunch, when the crew was sharing stories, I asked Mike about a technique I'd seen him use a genuine question about something he was clearly skilled at. His surprise was visible before he launched into an explanation.

For two weeks, I maintained this approach: arriving early, working with intense focus, acknowledging criticisms without emotional reaction, and recognizing the strengths of the very man who tried to diminish me.

By the third week, something had shifted. The comments had almost stopped. When I spoke in group discussions, Mike actually listened. One afternoon, when I solved a problem that had been slowing us down, he was the first to acknowledge it.

When I told my grandfather about the change, he nodded knowingly. ""You stopped asking for respect and started commanding it. Big difference.""

Then my Grandpa went on to explain that true respect comes from three things: competence in what you do, consistency in how you show up, and composure in how you handle difficulty. ""Most men waste energy fighting for recognition when they should be focusing on being undeniably good at something that matters.""

That conversation changed everything for me. I realized that respect isn't about intimidation or dominance the things I'd associated with masculine respect. It's about becoming someone whose value is self-evident through their actions.

In the years since, I've found this principle works universally. When someone disrespects me now, I see it as information about them, not a judgment of me that needs defense. My response isn't to demand the respect I ""deserve,"" but to continue embodying the qualities that command it naturally.

My grandfather passed away last year, but those five words ""respect is taken, not given"" remain the most valuable lesson he ever taught me about navigating the world as a man.",10,1767872989.0,TheImprovementRoom,3,1.0,False

But my phone was hot in my pocket. Battery 100 percent. Usage? Unavailable. Something had been running all night.

I tried to ignore it. Elena texted first: “Don’t forget brunch. You’re wearing yellow, right?” I laughed. Yellow was my favorite. I typed back emojis. Normal. Cute.

Then the kitchen lights flickered. Just a blink, but my cereal stayed still mid-spill. My spoon hovered. I blinked. It fell. Late. Like my body lagged behind me.

The green dot on my phone stayed on. Always on. Front-facing camera. Always.

Elena arrived. She was beautiful, bubbly, smiling. But her eyes… glitched. Just for a second, I saw jagged edges, pixels where pupils should have been.

I laughed it off. I’m seeing things.

Then the mirror broke reality. Not cracks. Layers. My reflection froze mid-laugh, then blinked twice while I only blinked once. My skin… wasn’t skin. Beige polygons, no texture. Then snap—normal. My hands didn’t move how I willed them. My jaw twitched uncontrollably.

I heard whispers. Not Elena. Not me. Something layered, echoing.

FOCUS GROUP VIEWING — LIVE

Rows. Dots. Watching. Counting.

My knees hit the floor. My heartbeat wasn’t mine. My arms stretched the wrong way.

Elena crouched beside me, smiling too bright, too perfectly.

“They told me to check compliance,” she said, voice stacking in layers. “If you resist, it… changes you.”

Changes me.

I scrambled backward. My hands didn’t obey. My arm passed through the floor.

Then my face slid sideways. Skin, bone—like wet clay.

In the mirror, twelve me’s screamed, cried, laughed—glitching at once. One reached out, fingers mine.

I fell. My body wasn’t mine. Every movement a tug-of-war. Bones skipped frames. Eyes blinked twice while my mind only once.

The green box multiplied. Hundreds. Thousands. Pulsing with my heartbeat.

Ceiling wavered. Shadows twisted and jumped.

Text scrolled across the mirror:

she even said to me the other day I’m her favourite customer I brought a coffee out of the machine the other day went back there the next day and she accused me of wasting a coffee she said I pressed on the machine for my coffee then I took my coffee then I pressed it again for another 1 and the coffee when straight down the drain she said her manger watched it on the cctv 


I said why would I do that Is this a wind up!

Let’s have a time-out first, sip some coffee ☕️ and have some honest reflective self-assessment 📝

About me: 35 yo, 5'3"", nerdy and confident enough to hold any variety of topics (from philosophy, psychology, even if we reach multiverse topics). But I also very much appreciate silence (if you are like me who can be contented by just observing people and things around even without talking to anyone). I live in QC but works in BGC. IT by profession, decent and with a sense of humor.

About you:

• Hoping for someone who has the same chill and light vibes (no negative vibes) 👊🏻

• No height preference

• ⁠no age requirement (I love to talk to varieties of people)

• ⁠decent

• Confident in herself 

• ⁠great smile and great eyes (just a bonus) 🤩

• ⁠working professional (but dont worry the coffee date is on me)

• don't be problematic, we can rant about some stuffs just to let it off our chests

I have sets of interesting topics and questions to ponder on, so no need to prepare. Just be yourself. We know, maybe this is the plot twist we've been waiting for.

I also have 360 view of QC if that’s what you are looking for.

The fact that back to the future and the Truman show were both referenced as inspiration or required watching - back to the future was mentioned due to the Robin talking about flux capacitor. The Truman show and eternal sunshine - I believe this was used for inspiration as a reality characters need to escape from - ie vecnas mind - which happens throughout season 5. So yes you can clearly see the inspiration regarding eternal sunshine and the Truman show.

Jamie’s video - this is just a classic SNL type sketch. Yes it breaks the 4th wall - that’s the joke. They’re not new lines. They’re from the episodes.

The torch that reveals the message ‘Vecna lives.’ There’s reviews on Amazon of this torch in October before the first episode of Season 5 released. At the beginning of season 5 the characters question whether Vecna is alive as they can’t find him in the upside down. He officially appears towards the end of volume 1. So that merch is just teasing this. It may have even been available before the first trailer launched.

The hints on social media. Compelling but likely that they noticed the trend and latched onto it to trigger higher engagement.

What does this leave us with?

The red scripts - there are images of the cast with red scripts in the outfits of the clothes worn in the finale.

The changing colour of the lever - possible technical issue? A stupid mistake on the level of the coffee cup in game of thrones.

The promise of a dark Christmas - El ‘dies’ and Mike is left depressed and ultimately alone. Metaphorically he is trapped as he becomes the storyteller. Pretty dark end of this duo.

There’s quite a few storytelling inconsistencies, the missing monsters etc I find it hard to believe Hopper would be fine. But I think that was the reason for the scene where El says she was never his child and the time skip. I don’t like it but I think that’s what they were going for.

The weird haircuts. Unfortunately - I think the Duffers are under the impression once you grow up you do conform and that’s just life.

Is there any chance it’s the behind the scenes that’s the hidden finale. Possible, but unlikely. It would be false advertising and potentially leave them open to legal issues. The majority of the GA would also be confused and if it’s Meta as some have suggested - it would further muddy the waters of an already confusing, convoluted end.

I’m disappointed, I thought the ending was seriously flawed and the epilogue was weird. But I think I’m ready to accept it’s just poorly written. Endings are notoriously difficult to get right.

Man’s driving through places like Luanda, Nairobi, Lagos, Addis-Abeba, seeing skyscrapers, nice roads, Starbucks-level coffee shops, and people back home are like ""wait… there’s electricity? cars? Wi-Fi? I thought it was just villages and lions everywhere"".

Bro, it takes one loud streamer running around for y’all to finally figure out Africa isn’t one big safari park? Y’all got unlimited access to Google, YouTube, literally everything, but somehow this is news to you. That’s not the media ""hiding"" stuff, that’s just not caring enough to look.

Meanwhile, Africans on Twitter, TikTok, and even here on Reddit are dying laughing at these reactions. They’re making memes. It’s peak comedy for them that this blows so many minds.
So yeah, maybe pick up a book, watch something that isn’t American news, or just… idk, talk to someone from another country once in a while. Stop letting a YouTuber be your only source of world knowledge.

Am I being unreasonable?,"We’ve been together for 3 years. He used to be the most kind, caring, thoughtful person but lately it feels like he’s completely changed. I’m not sure whether it’s a me-problem and I feel guilty for feeling this way. This is my first relationship and I’m not sure what to feel. Am I supposed to tolerate this and keep pushing through? I’ve listed all the things I’m not ok with below: 

#Transportation + lodging
Our course requires us to go on rotations where we change locations every month or so. I do all the driving and paying for the accommodations since bf can hardly afford them. He doesn’t have a car and if I were to make him pay for 1/3 he might not have enough for food. He practically lives rent free, no bills, no gas. He used to do the housework as a way to help me out he now does the laundry and that’s it. 

#Friends
We used to be in the same friendship group until I discovered that a majority of the guys were either cheating on their gf or have cheated with 0 remorse (claims to all be feeling guilty but their actions suggest otherwise). After I knew this I left the group and so has my bf. However, recently, I found out bf still talks to them, goes to the gym, have dinner, etc. fairly regularly. He keeps lying to me saying he’s not going to talk to them anymore because of their poor moral standing yet goes behind my back and still keeping them as friends.

#Sex
We have fairly rough sex to which I enjoy. At the beginning of the relationship he would give me aftercare after sex and princess carries me to the bath. Not anymore. We fuck and go our separate ways to the shower. 

#Cries when confronted
I have tried many times to tell him how I was feeling, things that I felt weren’t ok etc. I’ve never raised my voice, none of these confrontations were aggressive, they’re more like conversations. I do try to tell him as gently and phrase everything as softly as I can. He breaks down and cries every single time and the conversation goes nowhere. I’m afraid to even try to ask him to stop crying.

#Period
At the beginning he would treat me like a princess when I’m on my period. He would do all the chores, tuck me in, get me chocolate/ sweets. Now, he gives 0 fuck when I’m on my period. He said he was going to make dinner when I was on my period then decided that “it looks like you’re cramps aren’t too bad today” and that whatever he made wouldn’t taste as good as mine anyways. Surprise, surprise! I’m the one cooking. 

#Coffee
I hate the smell of coffee being brewed makes me nauseous and gives me a headache for some reason. He knows this yet he recently picked up a hobby of coffee-making. His joy is my misery. My flat now smells like coffee. My sanctuary is now hell.

#Cringey behaviours
Anime style. When something perplexes him he does the exact anime pose of holding his head in his hands and bending backwards. Includes other anime poses as well. Proceeds to *Falls to the ground* claiming he has hypotension (he does not). I did not know he was like this before I got into the relationship. At first he would do them sparingly maybe a few times in a yr. Now it’s weekly and at inappropriate times as well.
 
#Treats my stuff like it’s his
He comes from a somewhat middle-lower economical standing. He doesn’t have a lot so I try to give him as many nice things as I can. He somehow breaks the majority of the stuff I lend to him. Hand knitted keyring? Gone. Favourite flask (flew to japan for this)? Dropped on concrete, can no longer insulate drinks. Car? Crashed. Enough said. When I try to tell him to please take care of the things I lend him he tells me, in a roundabout way, to stop being materialistic. 

#Gets into a lot of avoidable drama
All the time for no reason whatsoever. All of them were very much avoidable. He dug the hole himself and complains how he gets treated poorly by his peers. An example of this would be siding with his aforementioned cheating friends (gfs who were cheated on were in the same yr and course as us) leading to the other girls in our entire yr not wanting to interact with him. 


#User behaviour + I’m his mummy now
I’m literally a doormat and I provide him with everything. He never turns them down or tell me I don’t have to exert myself for him that he could do those things himself. (I know I’m a doormat I’m working on it pls don’t dogpile me). I house him, give him clothes, feed him, keep him up to date on uni assignments, drive him, etc. I feel like I am his mum.

#Gossips about ex gf all the time
ALL THE FUCKING TIME FOR 3 FLIPPIN YRS. I do not need to know your ex gf pees in the shower. 

#Passive misogyny
He sprinkles in passive misogyny from time to time. Examples: 
- Has a gc with his friends called “rich girl fuckers”
- When I was sore from sex he would say “oops sry guess I was too big :D”
- Would refuse to put on a condom at the beginning of the relationship. Only puts one on when he’s close to finishing

#Hot girls on twitter
We were outside waiting for the train home. My phone died and I wanted to scroll (sry I have monkey brain) so I asked him could I pls use your phone for twitter. Lo and behold titties everywhere. Now I know how twitter works porn can show up even if you’ve never searched for them. However, his feed was all tits and OF models. Which would be impossible unless that’s all that he looks at. I also looked at his search history and they were all in fact OF models. BF still proceeds to lie straight in my face saying he never looked anyone up and has no clue why his feed is filled with OF models. 

TLDR: BF annoys me a lot. I want to know how I’m supposed to navigate the relationship. I don’t really want to breakup with him since he’s my first bf but is this relationship worth it? How do I stop being annoyed at him? ",0,1767871831.0,relationships,14,0.33,False

I didn’t notice him at the start but he went out of his way to chit chat with me. He ended up adding me on LinkedIn and messaging me there. Soon he was sending me essays about his life, his past, his family, holidays etc. I was responding, excited to form a bond with someone (i wasn’t sure myself if I wanted it to be romantic, I was depressed & isolating so it felt incredible having someone wanting to talk to me). It got to a point where I was getting multiple screen lengths of messages first thing in the morning, light bickering at work (including coffee runs which was just us bickering & him saying “I love bickering with you”), messages as we drove home (we live close to each other so take the same route), messages when he got home, “I’ll reply when I’m back from my run”, late night essays, then repeat. This went on for 4 weeks. At this point I start dating a guy I’d liked before but quickly cut him off because my bond with this guy was stronger. He always told me he was doing things alone “i went camping”, “i went to America”, “i have a games night every week”, “i went on a wine tour with a tour group”, “i have a friend who comes around to take care of my dog when im at work”. 4 weeks later, it was my birthday and I just had the urge to self sabotage. “Did you move to this city alone or with friends or a partner?”. He says “with a partner”. My jaw was on the floor. I knew everything about this guy. Except this. I asked about his partner, changing the tone to pretend I was being friendly all along (after all, I have always been guarded with my feelings and establish a friendship first before diving in so it didn’t hurt too much). He glazed over a lot of the questions so I sympathised, assuming I was intruding on what was possibly a rough patch, since he loved sharing information otherwise. Our conversations continued, he was mildly flirty, I wasn’t but I didn’t stop him either. He was back to referring to himself singular. I assumed they had broken up and he didn’t wanna talk about it. He changed his Instagram photo from both of them to just him (but we were still only talking on LinkedIn). He seemed to relate a lot to my singleness and urge to do a lot of things solo. I have been single for 4 years, barely dated and it might just be in my head, but it felt like he liked that about me

Weeks go by and I was meant to go for a day festival with a couple of friends. He was curious about it. A friend cancelled the night before, so I told him about it. He replied within seconds. Pres were at mine. My other friend was driving so didn’t drink much. John rocked up with beers and wine, left his stuff at mine including the wine saying we could have it later. I didn’t think much of it. At the festival, him and I decide to take a cap. I don’t remember the first hour, but when I clocked back in, he was lightly holding me (felt platonic) because I kept swaying and falling. We danced and had a great night, all of us. John kept talking about the wine we could have at home. I wasn’t sure, as I was coming down at this point. My friend drove us home, and John got off with me, talking about the wine again. I get home and crash on the couch. He references the wine again, I say I’ll be up for it after a little lie down. We then finish the bottle between us. There was a lot of eye contact from him, yes I loved it but I kept breaking it because I wanted to ask him what our deal was but was too scared. We were desperate for more drinks but ran out, he was craving cigarettes and I had an unopened box gifted to me so we went outside every 30 or so minutes to smoke. He’d start every smoke with “you look so cold, come here” and chuck his arm around me and rub my leg. I thought it was a little odd, but not enough to call out. It felt nice and I went with it. He then suggested a movie. I don’t have a TV, so I asked him to bring the laptop to the living room. He said the living room was too cold, and the bedroom was warmer so he suggested going there. There’s still a lot of eye contact but I’m still acting awkward. He keeps asking me if I’m alright, telling me I’m quiet. I wanted it, but I wasn’t sure I was reading it right and I didn’t know if he was single, yet I felt like I was intruding by asking. I could have sworn I’d once seen his gf on his lock screen. But I don’t know if I’d imagined it. We’re watching the movie, I’m keeping a clear distance between us and my eyes on the screen. He leaves the room for a bit, I assume to go to the toilet, and I go to the kitchen in the dark for my supplements. I see him standing outside the balcony on the phone. He sees me in the kitchen and comes back in, asking me what I’m doing. Usually he’s chatty and tells me who was on the phone, what they spoke about etc. nothing

6 hours pass, and he says he should probably leave but was really tired (we had work the next morning). I said he could nap or sleep at mine if he was tired but could also just go home if he wanted to. He was umm-ing and ah-ing, saying “I can’t…I’ve got a dog in the backyard waiting to be let in…I’ve got work tomorrow…I’ve got a dog…you know I can’t, I’ve got a dog”. I say “you should go home then. You’ve got the option if you wanna stay”. He falls asleep immediately after, reaches out mid sleep holding my hand. I pull away, and he does it again. We had an hour before our alarms went off. His phone rang but he was so deep in sleep he didn’t wake up. The next morning I called in sick. He said he had to go, then ran home. In my hoodie.

At the festival, we finally exchanged numbers (no Instagram still). He texted me heaps the next morning, then popped by with sweet treats and electrolytes, left immediately after. We spoke about that night heaps, wanting to do it again. He commented on my quietness and awkwardness again. I didn’t have the balls to explain it.

I went away on holidays shortly after, and after a week, our conversations died, after 3 months of daily texting. I came back and stalked his Instagram (we don’t follow each other). He had been tagged in several photos with his partner. They seem so happy. They’ve got a big friend group they seem to frequently do things with - games nights, wine tours, everything he told me he did alone. I really want to ask him to just explain what that was. But I’m scared he’ll deny it. Or tell me it was in my head. Or just won’t reply (hes not talking to me now). I’m so grossed out by him and myself right now. I only want confirmation of what that was so 1. He can realise he’s not as nice a guy as he says and acts like, 2. I can get over this conspiracy that no one ever values me as a person 3. Figure out what it is about me that attracts these situations (has happened twice before but at a MUCH smaller and way more nuanced sense) and 4. Just know for once what something meant, even though it’s meaningless in the broader scheme of things

We live in the same area and I’ll inevitably run into him/them. I don’t know how to react. I also want to reiterate that while my actions “rejected” anything extreme from happening, I was obviously participating enough to enable him more",24,1767871390.0,confession,69,0.66,False

I find it a bit weird because I never used to do this and could sleep straight until I wake up. What's a possible reason this is happening to me?

Additional info:

- I am 36M

- I go to sleep between 2 to 3 am and wake up between 8 to 9 am. This has been my sleep schedule for a long time now (>1 year). 

- I don't have any nightmares immediately preceding this; it happens even when I am in dreamless sleep

- I do not feel any physical pain or any urge to pee/poop upon waking. I go back to sleep straight away as mentioned



- I do not feel any external stimuli that causes me to wake; no insect bites or feeling my wife hugging me. My wife and I often sleep (in the same bed) with some distance from each other. I also do not hear any noise upon waking although we live near the road and we hear roadwork/noisy vehicles like motorcycles at all hours. I would expect that if it was a noise that woke me then I would have actually heard what type of noise it is, but I don't remember hearing anything that caused me to wake up. 

- I have been a heavy caffeine drinker (2 to 4 cups daily) for many years now and this has happened to me over the past few months irrespective of what time I had my last cup of coffee. This hasn't happened to me in previous years.

- I am a snorer and have gained a little weight over the past 3 years but I tend to sleep on my side, afaik we're more likely to wake ourselves snoring when we lie on our back

- I have not made any drastic changes to my diet recently

- This happens irrespective of my mental state at the moment; whether there's something bothering me or my mind's completely at ease I wake up then go back to sleep

- The room temperature is consistent; I sleep in a tshirt and shorts with air conditioner and a fairly thick blanket",1,1767871056.0,NoStupidQuestions,4,1.0,False

Emotional intelligence and Artificial intelligence.

I research and teach emotional intelligence. And develop all my programmes with EI embedded at their core ..

1. Psychological First Aid (PFA)

2. Corporate Mental Wellness

3. Leadership & Team-building

4. Mental Skills for Athletes

5. Suicide Prevention

6. Conference Speeches & Moderating

And I write my social media posts (whether Reddit or LinkedIn) on EI myself. Will not delegate this one to AI to do it for me. I’m possessive with my words. haha

AI is my assistant. It helps me where I fall short. To do some of the things that I like, but have no talent for it. 

I tell it to be self-aware and stay in its lane. And I say it does a very good job. Good boy 🤖.

Last week my 🤖 helped me create this image. Of everything that I love..

The outdoors, enamel mugs, fresh air . . .

So, can EI and AI be friends? And live side by side in the same space?

Of course!

Just like how Favikon is an AI-powered brand and influencer platform, leveraging AI to do what AI does best. 

but stays human, and authentic, in everything else. even right up to personally handwritten notes, on real physical cards. So much love 💝

I started rewatching the series ”Clone” which was popular in Russia and in former soviet regions.

I remember that in my village in Armenia my grandma and many other families had a set with coffee cups with the series characters. When I was little there was only left one cup with Zhadi but in my friend’s house there were many of them.

I tried to find it on the internet but there is only new stuff. I guess it was some very niche stuff which was sold at that time hehe

I was wondering if anyone’s family also had it. If you can send me a picture of it, I will be very happy!

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

1q78xib,https://www.reddit.com/r/BornWeakBuiltStrong/comments/1q78xib/how_to_rewire_your_brain_in_90_days_sciencebacked/,How to REWIRE Your Brain in 90 Days: Science-Backed Tricks That Actually Work,"okay so i've been deep diving into neuroscience for the past few months (books, podcasts, research papers, the whole deal) because i was tired of feeling like my brain was running on windows 95 while everyone else had the new iOS update. 

what i found changed everything. turns out most of us are walking around with brains that are literally underperforming because we're doing the exact opposite of what neuroscience says we should be doing. like we're all out here complaining about brain fog, memory issues, lack of focus but then doing the same shit that keeps us stuck.

the good news? your brain is way more adaptable than you think. neuroplasticity is real and you can literally rewire your neural pathways in about 90 days with the right habits. talking about real, science backed methods that top neuroscientists use themselves, not some productivity guru BS.

here's what actually works:

1. move your body in the morning (even for 10 minutes)

this one sounds stupidly simple but hear me out. when you do any kind of movement within the first hour of waking up, you're triggering BDNF (brain derived neurotrophic factor) which is basically miracle grow for your brain cells. 

dr andrew huberman talks about this constantly on his podcast. he's a neuroscientist at stanford and explains how morning movement increases dopamine and epinephrine levels that last for hours. not coffee jitters, but actual sustained focus and motivation. 

the movement doesn't have to be intense. literally walking around your block, doing jumping jacks, whatever. just get your heart rate up slightly. started doing 15 minute walks right after waking up and the difference in morning focus was insane within like 2 weeks.

2. learn something completely new (preferably something hard)

your brain needs novelty and challenge to build new neural connections. when you keep doing the same routines day after day, your brain literally starts pruning away unused pathways. use it or lose it is actually scientifically accurate.

pick up a language, learn an instrument, try a new sport, whatever interests you. the key is it needs to be genuinely difficult and outside your comfort zone. 

started learning piano through an app called Simply Piano (it's got a solid free trial and the lessons are actually engaging, not boring af). within a month noticed working memory improving in other areas. like remembering phone numbers and instructions better without writing them down.

there's this book called ""soft wired"" by dr michael merzenich who literally pioneered neuroplasticity research. he won the kavli prize in neuroscience and this book breaks down exactly how learning new skills physically changes your brain structure. it's dense but fascinating if you want the science behind why this works so well. this is hands down the best resource on brain plasticity found.

3. prioritize deep sleep (this is non negotiable)

sleep is when your brain does literally all of its maintenance work. during deep sleep your brain is clearing out toxic proteins, consolidating memories, and strengthening the neural pathways you used during the day. 

without proper sleep you're basically trying to run a high performance engine while it's actively breaking down. dr matthew walker wrote ""why we sleep"" and it will genuinely make you rethink your entire relationship with sleep. he's a sleep scientist at UC berkeley and the book compiles decades of research showing how sleep affects literally every aspect of brain function. seriously one of those books where you're like ""why did no one tell me this earlier.""

practical sleep tips that helped: no screens 1 hour before bed (yeah know, but try it for a week), keep your room cold (like 65-68 degrees), blackout curtains or eye mask, consistent sleep schedule even on weekends.

also use Insight Timer for guided sleep meditations. it's free and has thousands of options. the sleep meditations actually help fall asleep faster instead of laying there spiraling about random shit from 10 years ago.

bonus thing that surprised me

fasting or at least increasing the gap between dinner and breakfast. when your body isn't constantly digesting food, it can focus energy on cellular repair including in your brain. there's solid research showing intermittent fasting increases BDNF and promotes autophagy (your cells cleaning out damaged components).

not saying go full biohacker mode, but even just stopping eating after 7pm and not eating again until 8am the next day makes a noticeable difference in morning mental clarity. dr rhonda patrick discusses this a lot on her podcast FoundMyFitness, she's a biomedical scientist and breaks down the research in a way that's actually understandable.

the reality check

look, none of this is magic. you won't do these things for 3 days and suddenly become limitless bradley cooper. but if you stick with it for 90 days, your brain will physically change. scans show it, research proves it, and you'll feel it.

the system we live in doesn't really encourage brain health. we're pushed to sacrifice sleep for productivity, sit at desks all day, eat garbage food, never learn new things after school ends. so yeah, your struggling brain isn't entirely your fault. but now you have the tools to work with your biology instead of against it.

start with one habit. just one. get that solid for a few weeks then add another. trying to overhaul everything at once is how you burn out and quit.

your brain is literally the most complex thing in the known universe and you get to optimize it. might as well figure out how.",1,1767870093.0,BornWeakBuiltStrong,0,1.0,False

1q78tw9,https://i.redd.it/dcqmhztvv3cg1.jpeg,Part One: The Woman Who Wasn't There,"**The Woman Who Wasn't There**

**The Gallery Opening, October 2015**

The champagne is French, and Maria Adela's hands shake slightly as she pours it into plastic flutes. She has rented this small space in Naples's historic center for six months now, and tonight is the first time she has invited people to see her work properly. The jewelry catches the late afternoon light... silver bracelets laid out on black velvet, necklaces hanging from a display she built herself from driftwood she found on the beach.

She is nervous…. more nervous than she should be for something this small.

A woman enters, mid... forties, American accent, wearing the kind of casual elegance that military wives perfect over years of moving between countries. She picks up a bracelet, turns it over in her hands.

*""This is beautiful,""* she says. *""Did you make it?""*

*""Yes.""* Maria Adela's voice comes out quieter than she intended. She clears her throat. *""I design everything myself. Each piece is inspired by... well, by all the places I've lived.""*

The woman looks at her with sudden interest. *""You're not from Italy?""*

And this is the moment Maria Adela both dreads and needs. The moment when someone asks, and she has to explain. The story is true... it has to be true because she has lived it, carried it, been shaped by it. But telling it never gets easier.

*""I was born in Peru*,"" she says. *""But my mother brought me to Moscow when I was two. For the Olympics in 1980. She left me with a Russian family she'd met. She was supposed to come back."" Maria Adela pauses, arranging her face into the expression she has learned works best... sad but not too sad, vulnerable but not broken. ""She never did.""*

The American woman's face does what faces always do when Maria Adela tells this story. Shock, then sympathy, then a kind of protective warmth. *""Oh my God. That must have been...""*

*""It was hard.""* Maria Adela picks up the bracelet the woman is holding, runs her thumb over the silver. *""The family raised me, but I always felt like I was... borrowed. Like I didn't really belong to anyone. I spent my whole childhood in Russia, but I was not Russian…. and I've never been to Peru, so I'm not really Peruvian either. I'm just... between things.""*

*""That's awful.""* The woman reaches out, touches Maria Adela's arm. The touch is brief but genuine. *""I can't imagine.""*

*""You learn to adapt.""* Maria Adela smiles now, making it brave. *""That's why I make jewelry. Each piece is a little bit of everywhere I've been. A way of carrying all those places with me.""*

The woman buys the bracelet. More people arrive. Maria Adela tells the story three more times that evening, and each time she watches the same transformation happen. Curiosity becomes sympathy becomes a desire to help. By the end of the night, she has sold four pieces and received three invitations to coffee.

When everyone leaves, she locks the gallery door and walks back to her apartment in Posillipo. The neighborhood sits on cliffs overlooking the gulf, and tonight the water is calm, reflecting the lights of the city. She climbs three flights of stairs to her small apartment. Before she even opens the door, she hears the meowing.

*""I know, I know,""* she says, pushing inside. *""I'm late.""*

Luisa, her black cat, winds between her legs, complaining. Maria Adela scoops her up, buries her face in soft fur. The cat is warm and solid and real.

*""Good day,""* she whispers to Luisa. *""People came. They liked the jewelry. They liked me.""* She carries the cat to the window, looks out at the city spreading below them. *""Maybe this time it will work… maybe this time I can stay.""*

Luisa purrs. Maria Adela stands there for a long time, holding the only constant thing in her life, watching the lights of Naples glow against the darkness.

**The Lions Club Meeting, March 2016**

The room smells like coffee and the kind of cologne older men wear too much of. Maria Adela sits in the back, trying to make herself small, watching how the Lions Club meeting works. There are about twenty people here, mostly couples. She recognizes the American woman from her gallery opening... her name is Patricia, and her husband is a lieutenant colonel stationed at the NATO base.

Patricia waves at her, mouths *""I'm glad you came.""*

The meeting is boring. Reports about fundraising…. discussion of a community service project. Someone talking about membership numbers. Maria Adela's mind drifts. She is good at making her face look interested while thinking about other things.

Then Patricia stands up. *""Before we adjourn, I want to introduce someone. Maria, will you stand?""*

Maria Adela feels her heart kick against her ribs. But she stands.

*""Maria Adela is a jewelry designer here in Naples,""* Patricia says*. ""She's originally from Peru but was raised in Russia. She's new to the city and looking to get involved in the community. I think she'd be a wonderful addition to our club.""*

The president, a German officer named Thorsten, nods at her. *""Tell us a bit about yourself.""*

Maria hates this part. But she has learned to do it. She tells them about her mother leaving her in Moscow…. about growing up displaced…. about how she has lived in so many cities, always looking for somewhere that feels like home. Her voice cracks at the right moment, and she sees the faces around the room soften.

*""Naples feels different,""* she says. *""I've only been here a few months, but there's something about this city. The way people live out loud, you know? The way they let you see their emotions. I've spent my whole life feeling like I had to hide parts of myself. Here, I don't feel that way.""*

It is not entirely a lie. Naples does feel different. Whether that is good or bad, she is not sure yet.

After the meeting, people come up to her. They welcome her…. ask about her jewelry. A Belgian woman invites her to coffee…. an Italian businessman asks if she needs help with permits for her gallery. Thorsten, the German president, shakes her hand.

*""We're happy to have you,""* he says. *""We need people with your kind of perspective. International. Understanding what it means to live between cultures.""*

*""Thank you,""* Maria Adela says. *""That means a lot.""*

**She means it…. it does mean something. These people are opening a door for her, and she is tired of standing outside doors.**

Patricia walks her out to the parking lot afterward. *""I have a good feeling about you,""* Patricia says. *""I think you're going to fit right in.""*

Maria Adela drives home, and for the first time in months, she feels something that might be hope. The Lions Club is full of NATO families... people who work at the base, who move between countries, they understand displacement. They are exactly the kind of people who will accept her, include her, trust her.

**They are exactly what she needs.**

**Coffee with Shelia, June 2017**

Shelia Bryant is the kind of woman who makes you sit up straighter without meaning to. She is an American colonel, Naval Inspector General for Europe and Africa, and she has a way of looking at you that suggests she sees more than you are saying. But she is also warm, funny, and quick to laugh.

They are having coffee at a place near the waterfront, and Shelia is telling a story about her teenage son refusing to eat anything except pizza since they moved to Italy.

*""I keep telling him, 'You're in one of the food capitals of the world,'""* Shelia says. *""But no. Pizza... Every Single Day.""*

Maria Adela laughs. It feels good to laugh. She has been in Naples for three years now, and Shelia has become one of her closest friends. They have coffee every few weeks, attend Lions Club events together, celebrate each other's birthdays.

*""At least Italian pizza is good,""* Maria says.

*""True.""* Shelia sips her espresso, studies Maria over the rim of the cup. *""So how are you really doing? You seem tired lately.""*

Maria Adela looks down at her hands. She has been careful not to seem too perfect, too put together. Real people have bad days…. real people get tired.

*""I've been thinking about my husband,""* she says quietly. *""It's been four years since he died, and most days I'm okay. But sometimes it just hits me, you know? That he's gone. That I'm alone.""*

Shelia's face softens. *""I can't imagine losing someone that young. You must have been devastated.""*

*""I was.""* Maria Adela's voice is barely above a whisper now. This is the part she is best at... the vulnerability, the grief that is real enough to be convincing*. ""We only had a year together. One year. And then he got sick so fast. The lupus, the pneumonia. By the time I understood how serious it was, he was gone.""*

*""I'm so sorry.""* Shelia reaches across the table, squeezes Maria's hand*. ""But you've built a good life here. You have friends... have your business… you're not alone anymore.""*

Maria nods, makes herself smile. *""You're right. Naples gave me a second chance. All of you gave me that.""*

They talk about lighter things after that. Shelia's upcoming work trip. A charity gala they are both helping organize. A new restaurant someone recommended. The conversation flows easily, comfortably, the way it does with real friends.

When they part ways, Shelia hugs her. *""Text me if you need to talk,""* she says. *""Anytime.""*

*""I will,""* Maria Adela promises.

She walks back to her car and sits behind the wheel for a moment, watching Shelia disappear into the crowd of tourists and locals. Shelia is a good person. Kind, genuine, the type of friend anyone would be lucky to have.

Maria Adela wonders, not for the first time, what Shelia would think if she knew. If she knew anything real.

She starts the car and drives home to Luisa.

**The Offer, April 2018**

Thorsten catches Maria after a Lions Club meeting, pulls her aside while everyone else is gathering their things to leave.

*""I need to talk to you about something,""* he says. He looks uncomfortable.

*""Is everything okay?""* Maria Adela asks.

*""The club is in trouble.""* Thorsten glances around, lowers his voice. *""Membership is down. We've had three families transfer out of Naples in the last two months, and we're not getting new members fast enough. If we can't maintain minimum membership numbers, we'll have to disband.""*

Maria feels something tighten in her chest. The Lions Club has been her anchor in Naples. It gave her community, purpose, access to the families she needed to be close to. She cannot lose it.

*""What can we do?""* she asks.

*""That's the thing.""* Thorsten looks genuinely distressed. *""I don't know. The membership dues are due next month, and several people have said they might not renew. If too many drop out...""* He trails off.

Maria Adela makes a decision. It is risky, but necessary. ""*How much are we short?""*

*""What?""*

*""The membership dues. If everyone renewed, how much would we need?""*

Thorsten does some mental math. *""Maybe three thousand euros? But that's if everyone pays, and I don't think... ""*

*""I'll cover it,""* Maria says.

Thorsten stares at her. *""What?""*

*""I'll pay everyone's dues. Whatever we need to keep the club going.""* She makes her voice firm, certain. *""This organization means everything to me. You all gave me a home when I had nothing. This is the least I can do.""*

*""Maria, that's... that's incredibly generous, but I can't let you... ""*

*""Please.""* She puts her hand on his arm. *""Let me do this. I have some money from my husband's estate. I want to use it for something good…. for something that matters.""*

Thorsten looks like he might cry*. ""Are you sure?""*

*""I'm sure.""*

He accepts. The club is saved. Maria is no longer just a member... she is a benefactor, someone who sacrificed for the community. Her position becomes even more secure.

That night, she goes home and transfers the money. It is a lot of money…. more than she should spend. But it is worth it. The investment will pay returns she cannot calculate in euros.

Luisa jumps onto her lap while she is sitting at her computer, pressing her head against Maria's chin.

*""We're staying,""* Maria Adela tells the cat. *""They need us. We're important here.""*

Luisa purrs, unconcerned with the machinations of human social organizations.

Maria Adela holds her and feels, for just a moment, genuinely happy.

**The Gala, July 2018**

The NATO annual ball is held at a hotel on the waterfront, and Maria Adela wears a dark blue dress that cost more than she wanted to spend but looks exactly right. She photographs everything... the officers in their dress uniforms, the national flags displayed along the walls, the tables arranged for dinner.

She posts a photo on Facebook with the caption: *""Honored to celebrate with these incredible people who serve their countries with such dedication.""*

The comments come quickly. Hearts and supportive messages from friends who think she is just a jewelry designer who loves the military community…. who think she belongs here because she is kind and genuine and they like her.

Shelia finds her near the bar. *""You look beautiful,""* Shelia says.

*""So do you.""* Maria Adela means it. Shelia looks elegant and confident in a way Maria Adela admires.

They watch the formal ceremony together... the posting of colors, the national anthems, the speeches about alliance unity and shared purpose. Maria has been to enough of these events now that she knows when to stand, when to place her hand over her heart, when to applaud.

Later, during dinner, she sits with a table of mixed couples... American, German, Italian. The conversation flows in multiple languages, and Maria shifts between them easily, translating jokes, helping people understand each other.

A young American captain leans toward her. *""Where did you learn to speak so many languages?""*

*""I grew up in Russia,""* she says. *""But my mother was Peruvian and my father was German, so I picked up pieces of everything. And then I've lived all over Europe, so...""* She shrugs, smiles. *""I'm a collection of places.""*

*""That's really cool,""* he says. There is something in his eyes that suggests interest beyond linguistic curiosity.

Maria is careful with men. She dates occasionally, but never too seriously, never anyone too important. She has had a brief relationship with a NATO employee... nothing significant, nothing that crossed lines she could not afford to cross. But she is always aware of the possibilities, the doors that could open through the right connection.

The captain is young, probably twenty... seven. Not important enough to be worth the risk. But sweet, genuine, the kind of person who would trust her completely if she gave him the chance.

She smiles at him, lets the moment stretch, then turns back to the table conversation. Not now… maybe not ever. But it is good to know the option exists.

The evening continues. Dancing, more champagne, laughter that sounds genuine because in some ways it is. **Maria likes many of them…. under different circumstances, they might have been real friends.**

She takes a photo of the whole group at her table, posts it with a simple heart emoji. The image will stay on Facebook for years, a document of a moment that seemed happy and real.

**When she drives home that night, exhausted from smiling, from being present, from maintaining the performance, she feels the weight settle back onto her shoulders. The weight she carries always, the knowledge of who she really is and why she is really here.**

Luisa is waiting by the door, meowing complaints about being left alone for so long.

*""I know,""* Maria says, picking her up. *""I'm sorry. But it was important.""*

She carries Luisa to the window and looks out at Naples, this city that has become something like home…. even though nothing has ever truly been home. The lights spread out below her, each one representing a life she will never know, a story she is not part of.

Sometimes she forgets why she is here. Sometimes, in the middle of a Lions Club meeting or a coffee date with Shelia, she forgets that this is not real. That she is not **Maria Adela Kuhfeldt Rivera**, abandoned in Moscow as a child, searching for belonging.

Sometimes she wishes she could forget permanently. That she could just be this person, live this life, let everything else fall away.

**But that is not possible…. it has never been possible.**

She holds Luisa and watches the city and tries not to think about what comes next.

**September 14, 2018**

Maria Adela closes the gallery at six o'clock like always. She has not sold anything today, but that does not matter. The gallery has never been about sales.

She walks home through streets crowded with tourists and locals enjoying the warm September evening. Naples feels most like itself at this hour... loud, chaotic, alive. She stops at a small market to buy cat food and fresh bread, exchanges pleasantries with the owner who knows her by now, who asks about her day with genuine interest.

*""Slow,""* she tells him in Italian. ""*But that's okay. Sometimes slow is good.""*

At home, Luisa is waiting. Maria feeds her, makes herself a simple dinner of pasta and tomato sauce, opens a bottle of wine. She eats at the small table by the window, watching the sun set over the gulf, turning the water gold and then pink and then deep purple.

Her phone buzzes with messages. Patricia asking about next week's Lions Club meeting…. Shelia sending a funny meme about cats…. an American friend inviting her to dinner next Friday.

*She responds to each one, maintaining the connections, keeping everything normal.*

But something feels different tonight. A tightness in her chest that she cannot explain. A sense that something is shifting, that the ground beneath her is less solid than it was yesterday.

She finishes her wine, pours another glass. Scrolls through Facebook, looking at photos from the past three years. Her gallery opening…. Lions Club events…. charity galas…. beach days with friends. Hundreds of images of a life that looks real because in many ways it was real.

She posts a photo of Luisa curled in a patch of evening light. *""Friday night with my favorite girl,""* she captions it.

People like the photo immediately…. hearts appear…. comments about how cute Luisa is. Someone jokes that Maria Adela is a crazy cat lady.

*""Guilty,""* she replies with a laughing emoji.

She sits at the window until late, Luisa sleeping in her lap, the city glowing below. Tomorrow she will open the gallery…. tomorrow she will respond to more messages…. tomorrow she will continue being Maria Adela.

But tonight, something feels like it is ending.

She does not know why…. she does not know what. But the feeling sits in her chest like a stone.

**September 15, 2018**

Maria wakes early, before the sun is fully up. She makes coffee… feeds Luisa and goes through her morning routine automatically.

Then she opens her laptop.

She does not know what she is looking for until she finds it. An article published yesterday by a journalism organization called Bellingcat. Something about Russian intelligence, about passport numbers, about patterns that have been exposed.

She reads it once…. then again…. then a third time.

Her hands are shaking.

She closes the laptop. Sits very still. Luisa jumps onto the table, meowing for attention, but Maria does not move.

After a long time, she picks up her phone…. makes a call. The conversation is brief, in Russian, her voice flat and emotionless.

When she hangs up, she sits for another moment.

She packs one small suitcase. Changes of clothes, her passport... her real passport…. and a few photographs. Not much. She moves through the apartment like she is underwater, each action deliberate and strange.

Luisa follows her, confused by the disruption to routine.

Maria stops in the middle of packing, looks down at the cat. She could leave Luisa here. Someone would find her, take care of her. It would be cleaner, safer, smarter.

**But she cannot do it.**

She gets the cat carrier from the closet. Luisa protests, not wanting to go inside, but Maria Adela coaxes her in gently. *""We're going somewhere,""* she whispers. *""Both of us…. together.""*

She does not look around the apartment one last time. She does not take photos or mementos beyond what fits in her suitcase. She just leaves.

At the airport, she books a one... way ticket to Moscow using a credit card that is real but rarely used. The flight leaves in three hours.

She sits in the departure lounge with Luisa's carrier on the seat beside her. Around her, people are starting vacations, returning home, living normal lives. Nobody looks at her twice.

She does not text anyone…. does not post on Facebook…. does not say goodbye.

**She simply disappears.**

**Silence**

For three days, nobody notices.

On September 17, when Maria does not show up to a Lions Club planning meeting, Patricia sends a text. *""Everything okay? We missed you today.""*

No response.

By September 18, people are worried. The gallery is closed…. her apartment appears empty…. messages go unanswered.

Patricia goes to Maria Adela's apartment building, rings the bell. Nothing. She tries calling…. the phone goes straight to voicemail.

On September 20, several friends contact Italian authorities. They are terrified something has happened to her. An accident…. a crime, something terrible.

But there is no evidence of anything wrong. Her apartment is locked and undisturbed. She has simply left.

The confusion turns to hurt. Why would she do this? Why would she leave without saying anything? They were her family…. they loved her.

The questions circulate through the NATO community. Did anyone see her last? Did she say anything about leaving? Was she upset about something?

Nobody has answers.

The gallery stays closed; jewelry still displayed in the dusty windows…. her apartment stays dark. Weeks pass.

***Then, in November, Maria Adela's Facebook account updates.***

*""I'm so sorry,""* she writes. *""I've been sick. Cancer. I didn't want anyone to worry. I'm undergoing treatment. It's been the hardest thing I've ever faced. But I'm fighting. I'll be okay.""*

The photos she posts show her looking thin, fragile, her hair shorter. She looks like someone who has been through something terrible.

Her friends respond with relief and love. Cancer explains everything. Of course, she disappeared. When you're fighting for your life, nothing else matters.

They tell her to focus on getting better…. they send prayers and good wishes. They forgive her for leaving without warning.

Nobody questions the story. Why would they? Cancer is the kind of tragedy that makes sense. And Maria has already lived through so much tragedy. Of course, it would find her again.

The mystery is solved. Maria is sick, but she will recover. Eventually, maybe she will come back to Naples. Or maybe she will build a new life somewhere else.

Either way, they understand. They love her. They will always love her.

**The Truth**

Three years later, a team of journalists sits in an office in London, staring at a spreadsheet full of numbers.

One of them is on the phone with a veterinary clinic in Naples, asking questions that sound absurd even as he asks them.

*""Yes, I'm looking for records for a black cat named Luisa,""* he says in Italian. *""The owner was Maria Adela Kuhfeldt Rivera. I need the microchip number.""*

There is a pause. The veterinarian on the other end sounds confused but cooperative. *""Let me check our database.""*

Another long pause.

*""Okay, I have it. Do you need me to read it out?""*

The journalist writes down fifteen digits. Thanks, the veterinarian and hangs up.

Then he opens a leaked Russian database and searches for those same fifteen digits.

The search returns a match. Same cat. Same microchip number. Registered at a veterinary clinic in Moscow.

But the owner's name in Russia **….is not Maria Adela Kuhfeldt Rivera.**

The journalist stares at the screen for a long moment. Then he calls to his colleagues.

***""I found her.""***

 

**END OF PART 1**

The woman Maria Adela's friends loved never existed. The person they trusted was someone else entirely, living a lie so complete that even she sometimes forgot which parts were real.

**Her name was Olga Kolobova.** **She was a Russian intelligence officer. And for nearly ten years, nobody knew.**

**Part 2 will reveal:** Who was Olga Kolobova before she became Maria Adela? How did Russian intelligence build this perfect cover? What was she really doing in Naples? And how did a cat's microchip unravel everything? But that’s going to be too long, and much beyond the scope of 40k limit of this platform. Keep an eye on my Patreon.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1q78qpe,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1q78qpe/gaggimate_vs_dual_boiler_bdb_1000/,Gaggimate vs dual boiler (BDB) [~€1000],"Hi all

I was tired of my Delonghi Magnifica EVO Next. It makes decent coffee and was an okay compromise with my girlfriend. 

I drink a V60 on the daily and buy ground coffee from a local roaster. As I'm a coffee enthusiast, I really wanted more flavor and control over the produced coffee (even got my girlfriend to be a bit more invested).

This means I splurged on the Mazzer Philos (bought on the company VAT excluded for ~1000 EUR). 

Now I want to sell the coffee machine and get a semi. After research, it is clear most people prefer dual boiler. But it's also insanely more expensive. So I figured I could DIY an e24 with the Gaggimate mod. It would cost me 750 EUR. 

A typical day would include 1 or 2 Americanos, 1 to 2 Latte (for the girlfriend). Occasionally I would need to pull multiple shots when people are over and j don't want to be waiting forever between each shot. This is when I started considering a dual boiler. 

The Lelit Elizabeth and Sage Dual Boiler are both roughly 1250 so out of my range. But does the performance make it worth the extra money? 

Is there another machine to be recommended? I live in Belgium :)

1q78pt1,https://www.reddit.com/r/DunkTank/comments/1q78pt1/want_to_understand_ultimate_truth/,want to understand ultimate truth ?,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

***Positive Experience saying it’s better than SpikeVax or other previously taken vaccine***

1. Craycrayintheheihei - I’m 2.5 days post mNEXSPIKE and this was by far the easiet one. I’ve had regular Moderna (the worst), Pfizer, and Novavax. I had no symptoms from this one other than a sore arm but it’s almost all better. I did use Biofreeze on it thanks to a recommendation here and it helped a lot!
2. MirabelleSWalker - I have had strong reactions to mRNA in the past, but I had mNexspike and only had a very mild headache the next day.
3. Madamegruyere - I got mNexspike yesterday. After the OG Moderna shots I always needed a day in bed. Today I was able to function normally although I do have a minor headache, which is unusual for me. The injection site is tender to the touch but not blazing hot like other times. I drank extra water and moved my arm whenever I thought about it. So far I think it’s a winner. And my mom calls me the poster child for drug side effects!
4. PunkRockKing - Just got it this morning. So far so good. /  Yes before this I would get low fever and aches and chills for a day after. This lower dose version was a breeze.
5. \_notyourhoney -Moderna and Pfizer all wipes me out for 24 hours like you. Got the Mnexspike yesterday and my arm is sore and I'm very tired, but don't feel like I got hit by a truck like I normally do!
6. Dear\_Reader7 - I got mNEXSPIKE yesterday with my flu shot. Previous covid boosters had left me pretty miserable for the next day (aches, chills, fatigue), but all I had today was a sore arm and a mild headache.
7. Smart\_Serve9809 - I got vaxxed this morning and was expecting the worst. I actually didn’t realize I had gotten the mnexspike until this evening when I noticed wasn’t really having side effects so I looked up the vaccine record. The previous Moderna vaccines I’ve had knocked me on my ass for a solid 48 hours. So far I have a sore arm and am a little tired but that’s it. I’m 50, pre-diabetic and overweight with a history of depression.
8. Dkaccountname - Got Mnexspike yesterday. Have gotten fever chills with majority of past covid vaccines, but this one has resulted in almost no arm pain ( a lot of arm pain with flu shot last week!), and only a strange “fullness” in my head- not headache, not really dizzy, but woke up today with the feeling one gets when they’ve not slept in 2 days. At first thought I just had poor sleep, but remembered vaccine and think this is my reaction. Overall- lowest reaction of any of the prior COVID shots, which is great!
9. Madamegruyere - I usually need to stay in bed the day after any vax, but I got mNEXspike on Wednesday and was fully functional afterward. Mild headache and slightly tender injection site but no big deal.
10. mercuric5i2 - I got it yesterday. Arm soreness was significantly less and the usual flu-like symptoms (temp, super tired, touch sensitive, etc) were greatly reduced compared to my experiences with spiikevax.  I would ask your doc, though. mnexspike is claimed to have a stronger immune response, and i don't have an autoimmune conditon. For all I know you'd have the opposite experience of me. Remember mnexspike's data does show higher immune response, which is good.. for most folks!

***Positive Experience***

1. Delicious-Elk2619 - Same. This time I had a headache, muscle aches, and lethargy. Much better than a day of fever, chills, and general misery.
2. AuthorAltruistic3402 - I did. Almost 70 along with the flu vax. I didn't feel badly. DId my arm hurt? Lordy yes. I found the secret though. Biofreeze. It works. It was 2 days ago. NO sore arm today.
3. Tiny\_Palpitation8420 - I did this morning! I got flu in the same arm and it wants to fall off. I'm tired. But nothing crazy!
4. Eightgrainbagel - I got the Moderna mnexspike last weekend…of course I had a sore arm, and a little bit of dizziness that night. I was sure I was going to wake up the next day sick as a dog but I actually felt fine, maybe a little lethargic.
5. Successful\_Bug\_5548 - Took it. Little tired for a day and bit of a sore a. Got a flu vax at same time. Bad flu may be coming based on what happened in Australia this summer. Wear an M95 when you get the shot
6. Wrong\_Mark8387 -I was tired a little longer this year than last; may 8 more hours but nothing too annoying. Otherwise it was the same. Got flu and Covid at the same time again.
7. Nanabear-54321 - I got it Tuesday, and all I’ve had is a sore arm.
8. ClementineGreen - I took it and had no symptoms other than a sore arm. For past years I got pretty extreme reaction including fever and body ache
9. K1k1Mar - I did, yesterday, along with the flu vaccine. Typically I am down for 2 days with body aches, fever and exhaustion, but I took Advil before bed and all I really have is a slightly sore arm. I am shocked.
10. MenuCommercial8609 - No bad reaction for me. I had that same shot yesterday and just a sore upper arm
11. Rhaizee - Next to no reaction, just a sore arm. Took it with flu shot. 
12. Elvisabeth - Yes, a couple days ago. Didn't feel any different. Not even a sore arm. I'm 66 yrs old. My first vax was the J&J. Last year I had Pfizer. I'm super fortunate that I feel totally normal after these vaccinations.
13. iago\_williams - I got it together with my flu shot and had my usual response. Sore arm and a bit of fatigue for about 24 hours.
14. Stremmie - Same here. When the Covid shots first came out, both initial doses of Moderna gave me flu-like symptoms for about a day beginning 12 hours after the shot. Ever since then, every booster just gives me a sore arm and a little tiredness for 24 hours and then I’m good. All my boosters have been Moderna, except for one dose of Pfizer (which coincidentally the only time I’ve gotten COVID was after few months after my Pfizer booster).
15. Savings-Breath-9118 - I got it, a bit tired for a few days , nothing terrible BUT I took an extra strength Tylenol when I got home and one the next day.
16. LabLover2204 - Had it on 9/4. Felt achy and tired for about 2 days. Nothing I couldn't remedy with some Tylenol. All of my previous COVID vax were Pfizer, but this is what they had the day they became available.
17. Resident\_Spirit8504 - You know, I had Johnson and Johnson my first round too. It reminds me of that but without the fever that came with it. I don't know many people that had it too since it got pulled. My first and the booster right before they pulled it and then up to yesterday they've all been Pfizer. I have heard some awful stories about Moderna but this is no where close to what I expected that I'm going through now. I thought it would be worse.

18, 19. BillyNtheBoingers - Follow-up: got Nexspike Thursday along with the flu shot. It’s been 36 hours and no symptoms other than minimal arm soreness. (EDIT: my partner got achy and tired about 18 hours after the shot. He took ibuprofen and went to a movie, though, which he enjoyed. He came back, took more ibuprofen and went to bed early. 24 hours later and he is back to baseline.)

20. Irishliberalboomer – (Got Mspike yesterday. Was hoping husband would have no reaction. Unfortunately he was up half the night with chills.) I got flu, Covid and tdap and I’m fine. (I got three shots, he only got one).

21, 22 Mysterious\_Mango\_737's husband and daughter- Sorry for the bad news, but I had a reaction that included fever and chills, but only for a day. Husband had only a headache. I also wanted to hold out for Novavax, but glad I went ahead with mNEXTSPIKE.

***Mixed Experience***

1. Mysterious\_Mango\_737 - I'm 66 and got mNEXSPIKE because I didn't want to take a chance waiting for the Novavax. Had chills and fever overnight, but was ok by the end of the next day. (My husband is 71 and only had a slight headache.) My daughter got the SPIKEVAX and was just a bit headachy and tired for a day. Your mileage will vary.
2. Irishliberalboomer’s husband- Got Mspike yesterday. Was hoping husband would have no reaction. Unfortunately he was up half the night with chills. (I got flu, Covid and tdap and I’m fine.) (I got three shots, he only got one).
3. Resident\_Spirit8504 - I did yesterday. I feel kind of funky but not any worse than my Pfizer jabs. No fever, just achy and tired in general but I have rheumatoid arthritis so it could be that too (I'm not on any immunosuppressants because I've had bad reactions). The only oddball thing is the sides of my tongue are sore. They're not swollen, just sore. I'm in my late 40s if this helps anyone out.
4. Tamihera - I had a bad time for a couple of days with fever, chills, joints hurting. I got it Friday and my arm is still sore and swollen. But no “COVID welt” or hives this time, so it does seem milder than my previous experiences with Moderna. Like you, I really wanted NOVAVAX, but I heard it wasn’t supposed to be okay’d until November.
5. Stubbornmuseum - Got mNexspike two days ago and side effects seemed very similar to previous versions.
6. Heliumneon - I made a post about getting Mnexspike, and now it's been about 48 hrs. I felt a little worse than I expected based on the whole idea of dosage being lower, and I had mild fever and chills, and it lasted until this morning, so about 2 days. I slept lightly for those 2 days. No other soreness or anything. I do feel much better today. In my case it wasn't the worst but it wasn't nothing.

***Negative Experience***

1. No-Flatworm-7838 - I got it almost 36 hours ago and have been feeling quite unwell. Terrible headache, painful skin and scalp, RHR elevated about 20 bpm, slight fever. And a terrible nights sleep. This is my first Moderna after Pfizer and the last two Novavax.
2. Wynonnaspooltable - Nexspike made me fuzzy and feverish and all yogurt tasted rancid for about two days.
3. Wjldenver - There is a lot of individual variability. I took mNEXSPIKE and I'm experiencing pain at the injection site and significant chills. I'm glad I did not get the flu shot at the same time.
4. OkPackage8742  - I felt achy, head, chills, a high fever, and shortness of breath. It all lasted one day. I’m not sure if I’ll ever get another Covid vaccine again.
5. Plus\_Afternoon5918 - Yes. After 8hrs was so dizzy almost didn’t make it to the bed. Hard chills & fever much of the night. At 30hrs (9a.m. on 10/18) I passed out on my deck with my coffee. Yikes! Slept most of the day, otherwise dizzy & lethargic x2 days. Pfizer in the past has caused chills & fever the first night then smooth sailing + mild covid once each winter. All I can say is I hope my VERY robust immune response protects me this season. Like by 100% ok?
6. SensitiveIndustry443 - Had it yesterday and and I had more side effects than the usual Pfizer that I get. Chills fever general fluish feeling. But better than Covid any day.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

I need some practical wisdom from people who have walked this road before.

My family has been drinking instant coffee forever. I am trying to slowly pull them into the world of coffee. Whole beans, fresh grounds, manual brewing. The problem is not resistance, it is inertia. Anything that takes time or effort is immediately suspicious.

I am planning to start them on South Indian style filter coffee, with chicory in the mix. Familiar flavor profile, heavier body, comforting bitterness. Something that feels close to what they already like, but clearly better.

Here is where I need guidance:
	1.	Coffee to chicory ratio
What percentage actually works for beginners?
80:20? 70:30? 85:15?
I want strong and bold, but not muddy or harsh.
	2.	Beans: Arabica or Robusta?
From what I understand, traditional filter coffee leans toward Robusta for body and caffeine.
Is 100% Robusta the way to go?
Or a blend like 70% Robusta + 30% Arabica for balance?
	3.	Workflow for consistency
I already own a moka pot.
No espresso machine, no V60 sermon yet.
I want a repeatable, low-friction workflow that:
	•	Does not feel complicated
	•	Produces thick, satisfying coffee
	•	Can be done daily without turning into a science experiment

Grind size, water ratio, brewing steps. I am happy to follow a proper process as long as it is realistic for a household that currently worships instant coffee.

Ask yourself, are you really still in love with them, or are you just in love with the past? Missing a memory of time now gone? 

This is my experience: 
I loved who she used to be when she was younger, but not who she had grown to become after graduating college and settling into her work life. For context we got to know eachother in college, when we had so much free time. We used to cherish every moment together and make the most of everyday. 

She became someone mentally exhausted who ended up scrolling TikTok for 2-hours straight everyday after work, rarely even making eye contact with me when I spoke to her (this really hurt, but I’d never get angry). I used to blame myself for not being interesting enough or too boring — I’m not saying I was perfect — far from it in fact, but looking back, neither was she. 

The reality is people change and sometimes all you have left to love is a memory of someone. Every moment of our relationship I still pictured the perfect girl that showed up in my life when we were 20-years old. Even through a depressed period she was experimenting with retinol (covered in acne) - she still looked like the most beautiful person on Earth to me. 

Hanging onto a memory of someone stops you from moving on and loving again, so never do that — don’t be like me. The reality is, you don’t see them right now — so you’re clearly hanging on to all the memories you made together. Just try to look back and smile because they happened. 

Don’t be as pathetic as me and genuinely believe you’ve loved all you could for a lifetime and that one person is “the one”. — I closed myself off, travelled and now spend all my time building resources and things to help people as a way to love everyone else — but that leaves me a pretty lonely guy. 

Life works in mysterious ways and maybe someone special is waiting out there for you. Posting and consuming on reddit (any Social Media tbh) won’t bring you a step closer. Somebody out there is perfect for you in the present (today, now). 

It’s better to let go and love again than to hold on to somebody you used to know ❤️ 

—————

If this helped, don’t leave a comment — get off and go text someone to meetup for coffee. 

Not knowing what the future may hold can be scary, but you gotta keep moving. Take it from someone who’s been standing still for over 14 months, get out there 💛

1q78fst,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1q78fst/58m_excruciating_colon_cramps/,58M Excruciating Colon Cramps,"58M  
Male  
I'm in my late 50's and I've had this occur, on and off, for the last \~40 years.  
I'm obese, but had these issues in my 20's when I was very trim.  In those days, I actually discovered that the issue was being caused (or at least triggered) by my choice of underwear, which at that time was baggy boxer-shorts, with a strong elastic waistband.

I don't generally have any gastrointestinal issues.  Very occasionally a bit of indigestion, but nothing worth noting, and I never need to take anything for it.  
I do love a good coffee, and I usually find that 1 or 2 cups in the morning, encourages a thorough emptying, but its not extreme, and there is no diarrhoea.  Stools are generally firm, large and pass easily.  
I eat a reasonable amount of fibre, in the form of high-fibre cereals, beans, and vegetables.  
I don't take drugs, smoke, or drink much alcohol.  I drink a lot of water, and tray to stay well hydrated.

The pain sometimes occurs after dinner, late at night, or sometimes wakes me in the middle of the night.  
It's always low down, below my waist.  It may start in the middle, but moves and focusses in the lower left.  At a rough guess, I'd say in the vicinity of my Descending Colon.  
It comes in waves, always building up to a peak.  That then subsides, until the next wave starts.  Getting progressing more and more painful each time.  
I've never timed them, but I'd say it's 3\~4 minutes between peaks.  Untreated, attacks have lasted for a couple of hours, but I'd say on average a bad one was around an hour, before resolving.  
In each case, it seems that my colon is blocked, and is cramping.  But the pain is incredible.  
The condition resolves itself, when the blockage is passed.  
In severe cases, a hard stool is eventually passed (with some effort) followed by softness, followed by gushing diarrhoea that is basically just water.

In the worst cases I become extremely light-headed and have to lay on the bathroom floor.

Approximately 5 years ago, I had a terrible incidence that lasted for hours.  And eventually after passing a huge hard stool, there was substantial bleeding.  (The blood seemed to be coming from quite far up, and I was simply passing huge quantities of maroon coloured watery diarrhoea.  
I went to the ED.  They offered me pain relief, and told me to see my GP if the bleeding persisted.  
That is the only time that involved blood.

Since then, I have discovered a resolution.  At the first sign of pain, I drink a double-shot of espresso coffee.  Then at most there is 1 more cramp, before I'm able to comfortably pass a huge quantity of stool.  It's very soft towards the end, but doesn't progress to full-blown diarrhoea.  
I've had maybe 3 bouts, in the last 6 months, after nothing for a few years.

Whilst my coffee treatment now avoids the worst pain, and ends it quickly, I would still like to get an idea of what is happening.

1q78f20,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChineseLanguage/comments/1q78f20/my_experience_at_keats_school_kunming/,"My Experience at Keats School, Kunming","Hello, I would like to share my experience being a student at Keats School, specifically at Kunming, which is their headquarters. If you happen to have any questions, do feel free to reach out to me!

**My study ""configurations""**: I was a student at Keats for 4 weeks (1 month) and I took the 6 hours 1-to-1 intensive mandarin classes. I had classes from 1030hrs-1230hrs and 1330hrs-1730hrs. I had 2 teachers (2 hours and 4 hours) and I had the same teachers for my entire stay.  Do take note that the timings are not fixed for everyone and is based on the teachers' availability. I know of someone who signed up for the 4 hour daily lessons and was assigned timings that were far apart from each other. You may ask for a change in the timing (which usually means changing teachers) but it may not be guaranteed. I stayed over the Winter so there wasn't much students who stayed over as well (I think there were around 15 students on average every week).

**Activities**: Keats school offers activities everyday, Monday to Saturdays are free and Sundays are paid. In the weekdays, the activities will usually commence after dinner at around 1900hrs. The weekday activities ranges from movie nights, cultural nights, food nights (get dinner outside), sport nights, and others. These activities will often be close to school or in school itself, they are all free except maybe the food nights where you will have to pay for yourself in the restaurant selected. Saturday activities are free as well and usually it is a trip to a nearby park. Sunday activities are paid and not free, some past activities are the Yunnan Ethnic Minorities Village, Snow Mountain, and the Stone Forest.

**Food**: Keats school in Kunming offers free food (inclusive in the amount you paid) from Monday to Friday (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). For the weekends, you will have to source your own food. If you have certain food allergies or food that you can't eat, please let the life advisor or the teachers know so that they will cook food that you can eat. For example if you cannot eat pork, they will cook other meats during your stay. You may think that free food is awesome but the food may get boring and mediocre, especially if you are staying long term. Food delivery via Meituan (Mini app in WeChat) is very tempting everyday, especially with the very cheap options to get it delivered to school. Food delivery can be made exactly to the teaching floor (8th floor) or to your accommodation floor.

**Accommodation**: The accommodation is randomly assigned. For my case, I came to Keats alone and was given a single room with a queen sized bed and a private bathroom. I know of someone who got a bunk bed even when they came in alone as well. The accommodation assignment is really just random, if you do not like your room, you could probably ask for a change with the life advisor. My room was equipped with a mini fridge, standing fans, TV, wardrobe (multiple clothing hangers), clothing rack (dry your clothes after laundry), kettle, and a towel. You are able to ask for room service once a week, you will be given a piece of paper with information to fill to ask for room service.

**Lessons**: All of the lessons are taught in level 8 of the building. Most of the classrooms are 1-to-1 classrooms (essentially your teacher's office) with a few group classrooms. You will generally get a break after an hour or two of lesson time, depending on you and your teacher. Every week there is one outdoor lesson where you and your teacher get out of the normal classroom and head out somewhere in Kunming. This is where you get to put your lessons to practice while also getting to know your teachers a bit more (I loved my outdoor classes). The teachers will ask where you would want to go to so you could really control your outdoor lessons if you really wanted to. I'm sure that you could opt out of the outdoor lessons and choose to stay in school for normal lessons (you can check with your teacher), but I advise to go out!

**Lessons (More information)**: Before starting your official lessons on the Monday, you would typically meet your teachers the day before (Sunday). This is where your teachers will ask you questions on what you want to achieve during your stay. Yes that's right, all of your lessons will be best catered and adjusted for your needs. For example, you could ask to follow the HSK standards, follow a certain textbook, ask your teachers to pay more attention to speaking practices, etc. You can always feedback to your teachers to adjust to your needs. The life advisor will also give you feedback forms to track if you are needs are being met. I advise you to have a clear mind and intention of how you want  to spend your time learning at Keats so you are able to communicate it with your teachers.

**Teachers**: Apart from my assigned teachers, you get to meet other teachers as well. You can either meet them during lunch time or the school activities (one teacher will be assigned to accompany the students). The teachers are so friendly and will strike up a conversation with you. The teachers were more than just teachers, they felt like they could be your friend as well.

**Surrounding**: Keats school in Kunming is basically near the city center. There are a bunch of shopping malls within walking distance. Night walks are definitely the best where you can see the night lights from the buildings. Food stalls are pretty much everywhere. There is a nearby bookshop and cafe. There is Luckin Coffee across the street. There is a 24/7 convenience store right beside the Keats building. Go for night walks alone or with other students, there are the best!

**Transportation**: Transportation is very convenient in Kunming. The best transportations would probably be the subway or the electric sharing bikes (that are everywhere). Try to avoid booking a Didi during times where people get off work (1700hrs-1830hrs ish), there are usually traffic jams around the period and you are better off taking the subway. Riding the electric bikes may look dangerous but they are so fun and convenient! Please try them out! You can ask your teachers or your life advisor to get your accounts sorted (for electric bikes and subway).

**English**: The locals mostly do not speak English. This is the best situation to practice your Mandarin! However, the locals are extremely patient and friendly towards you even if you start pulling out Google Translate.

  
**Cash**: Like any other city in China, you almost do not need cash. Everywhere is either Alipay or WeChat and I advise you to get your payment methods sorted for both applications. You can decide to bring some emergency cash with you though, but as mentioned, you can pretty much survive in China with just your mobile phone.

**Weather**: Hands down the best weather all year round, not too cold and not too hot. However, I came in during the winter so in my opinion it was pretty cold where the lowest temperature can get down to 5 degrees celcius and average around 11 degrees celcius daily!

As someone who travelled out of the country alone to study Mandarin for the first time, I am glad that it was with Keats School and at Kunming. Through the bonds formed with my teachers and other teachers at Keats, I would come and choose Keats over and over again. I missed going to classes already ;( If you have read this post up until here, this means you are really considering going to China, going to Kunming to study Mandarin, take that leap and you won't regret it!

Of course provided the cafe owners agrees to it (we will be buying coffee, drinks, etc while we play)","I ask this question as I used to play friendly poker in my University and it had turned out to our favorite pass time. We played in one of the student's houses every weekend. But now in Hamburg where I am not a student anymore and cannot accommodate people in my house for the game, can I arrange it in a cafe for example? or is there any other such place where we can get together and this is in winter so parks and outdoors is not an option.",0,1767868214.0,AskGermany,2,0.5,False
