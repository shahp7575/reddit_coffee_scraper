I wanted to make a post, that hopefully Boogie and Wings see. This may feel like an attack on you guys, but it's not. Just one fat dude to a couple others. And I'll preface, I am a nobody. I don't do social media, I work 90 hours a week with 2 fulltime jobs, cook, and workout. This is, hopefully something that can just give you guys some insight or even help, if possible.

So, backstory on me. Born and partly raised in Las Vegas, NV. I grew up in a very rough area. Man, I couldn't even count the number of fights I got into. Starting at the age of 7, I started getting abused in various ways. My dad was an alcoholic. He'd beat the hell out of me every chance he got. On top of this, when I wasn't at my dad's house, I was being sexually abused by my uncle, at my mom's house. Shit was rough for me. When I turned 8, a couple things happened. An investigation occurred and my uncle was arrested and is still, to this day, on the registry (can't say name because of doxxing) and we moved from our rough area. This ""nicer"" area was pretty fun! There was this girl that lived across the street from us, whom befriended me. At the time, I thought it was cool. Getting older though, I realized it wasn't. She was 16 years old. The day she started abusing me, was the day ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"" came out. We went to the movie for her little brothers birthday. She was Adamant on sitting next to me. During the movie, well, shit happened. Anyways, on multiple occasions, she raped me. At the time, I thought all this shit was normal. Between my uncle and now her, I thought it was normal! 

So, this all continued for a couple years, until we moved again. Small town in BFE called Pahrump (not doxxing myself. Dont even live in state anymore) This is where shit really started happening. Getting older, I had very unhealthy sexual experiences and it led me down a depressive path. I started putting on weight. I mean, I was chunky before, but it escalated big time. Soda, was my vice. Up to adulthood, I was drinking about 1.5 to 2 gallons of Coke, daily! But it was something I turned to, to feel better.

To lose some weight, I partook in Muay Thai and Jiu Jitsu. I was pretty adapt at those combat sports. I mean shit, I grew up basically fighting everyone. Being the only white dude was a huge problem for me. I did this for a couple years, until one day, I tore my MCL. It was bad. To this day, I still have a limp. But, that was when things went downhill for me fast! Top it off, i got shot in April, 2021. Bullet came in through my back, broke my rib, and punctured my right lung, and is lodged in my spine. I have XRays and news articles to prove all this. The daily pain I endure, sucks! Long story short, I maxed my weight, on July 21st of 24, at 510 pounds. 

This, is when reality struck for me. I got a severe infection in my left leg. Ballooned to the size of a watermelon and it went septic. I was in a feverish state, double vision, severe dehydration, amongst other things. Doctor stated that if these aggressive antibiotics don't take hold in a couple days, I'm losing my leg. Thankfully, that didn't happen and things got better. But, that's when I decided, I never wanted to be in that position again. Aug 1st 2024, I did an complete, cold turkey, lifestyle change. Stopped consuming sugar, eating carbs, and made the switch to the Carnivore diet. As of this morning, 2/6/25, I am down to 381. No Ozempic. No bypass. No medications. Just sheer willpower and conviction. No longer type 2 diabetic. No longer suffering from high blood pressure. No longer eating foods with ingredients a 12 grade English student can't pronounce. I literally only consume, water, black coffee, grass fed ruminating meat, Pasture raised Chicken and eggs, and cage free no antibiotic pork. Holy fuck when I say, I feel incredible. 

Now, to my point. (Said it was a long one, but there's a reason) 

Boogie. Bro, fucking kudos to you man. Your weightloss journey is awesome. But, I fucking PROMISE you, you'd lose weight faster, if you got rid of the fucking Cheetos and junk food. Bro, I was actually mad that day you were basically dying from a leg infection and you had a bag of goddamn Cheetos with you. What the fuck? Dude, you're getting old as shit and the foods you eat, make a difference on you! You have a woman that loves you and that, in itself, should be worth more than your fucking stress cookies. Have a hinkering for sweets? Eat some grapes. Get rid of that shit in your house, dude! If you cant pronounce the ingredients or it has more than a couple, dont eat it!. Food is supposed to sustain you. Its not a hobby. We humans, we're not designed to eat 3 meals a day and eat junk food. You keep the Pharmaceutical industry in business.

Wings, holy shit man. I love you man (no homo) and I agree with a lot of your takes, but goddamn dude, we need to talk. When I watch the videos (I can never partake in the streams, I'm always working. But I catch up when I can) I see the hurt in your eyes. I watched the drunk stream just a few hours ago. Holy fuck, Brantley..... God damn. But man, she brought up your ""machoism"". And she had a point. You make yourself out to be this badass of physicality. Well, okay. But all it takes is a 12oz pile of Zaxbys chicken to break you. You may be macho, but your mental game, is fucking bitch made. You collapse under pressure and get way to fucking defensive. The constant, ""Here's the thing"" or ""Here's what I think"", when ever you have a take or try and defend yourself. Just let shit go! YOU control your mind. YOU need to take control! Same advice I gave Boogie, stop with the garbage food. Dude, you get upset whenever someone mentions their weightloss, or when Boogie stands up and you're impressed with how much weight he lost, you can do the same! You NEED to put your mind to it. Take back control. If you won't put your mind to it, don't even bother. You may as well go play tag with a big rig on a freeway, because you're just killing yourself. Just in a slower method. 

As I said, I weighed 510 pounds. I lost 129 pounds and continue to do so. I work 90+ hours a week and still make time to go to the gym and meal prep. I also love to cook and have been doing that for almost a decade. Shit, I'd love the opportunity to come to Fat Camp, just to prepare some healthy meals for you guys. Supply the food, I'll supply my time. Unfortunately, I work too damn much.

You guys are capable of great things and you have fans who actually care about you. Take this however you will. I just hope you guys know, that there's some of us out there, that live in the same shoes as you guys and knows how hard it is to make the necessary lifestyle changes. Again, I don't do social media. So this was really the only avenue I had to express my thoughts.

1iiz7oh,https://www.reddit.com/r/longevity_protocol/comments/1iiz7oh/if_you_want_to_fix_low_testosterone_here_are_31/,"If you want to fix low testosterone, here are 31 science-backed tips you could come up with:","I've seen countless posts/advice on boosting testosterone. Let’s be real—nothing besides TRT/steroids will drastically increase levels. Don't fall for fancy supplement labels. The key is lifestyle changes, with some supplements as support.

**THIS IS WHAT YOU CAN DO. THIS IS BACKED BY SCIENCE**



# Morning ritual:

1. **Vitamin D3**: Supports hormone function and bone health. Research has shown that Vitamin D3 supplementation can improve testosterone levels in men with low Vitamin D status. \[[Reference: Pilz, S., et al. (2011).\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21154195/#:~:text=Compared%20to%20baseline%20values%2C%20a,l%3B%20p%20%3D%200.001)
2. **Tongkat Ali**: Known for boosting libido and testosterone levels. Studies show it may improve libido and have an effect on testosterone. \[[Reference: Tambi, M. I. B. M., et al. (2012).](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21671978/)\]
3. **B-Vitamin Complex**: Essential for energy metabolism and overall health. B-vitamins play a role in energy metabolism, with B6 and B12 supporting nervous system function. [\[Reference here\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6930825/)
4. **Boron**: Trace mineral that influences testosterone levels. Some studies suggest boron supplementation can increase testosterone. \[[Reference: Naghii, M. R., et al. (2011).](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21129941/)\]
5. **Maca Root**: Adaptogen known for enhancing energy, stamina, and libido (**not testosterone**). Research indicates it doesn't significantly impact testosterone levels. \[[Reference: Gonzales, G. F., et al. (2002)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12472620/).\]
6. **Creatine**: Supports muscle growth and strength and may influence testosterone levels. Studies link creatine supplementation with increased muscle mass and slight test increases. \[[Reference: Volek, J. S., et al. (1997)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14685870/).\]



# Evening Ritual (60 min before sleep):

1. **Zinc**: Essential for testosterone production and immune function. Studies indicate zinc supplementation can increase testosterone. \[[Reference: Prasad et al., 1996](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8875519/).\]
2. **Magnesium (Citrate or Glycinate)**: Supports muscle and nerve function; aids relaxation and sleep. Magnesium has positive effects on muscle, nerve function, and sleep. \[[Reference: Cao et al., 2009.\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10745813/)
3. **Omega-3 Fatty Acids**: Anti-inflammatory effects + supports good sleep. Research suggests Omega-3s support sleep. [\[Reference: Hansen et al., 2014.\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7334763/)



# Adjustments:

1. **REMOVE sugar and processed foods**: Sugar intake disrupts hormonal balance. A study linked high sugar intake to lower testosterone. [\[Reference: Maggio et al., 2013.\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6311464/)
2. **REMOVE seed oils**: Use butter or extra virgin olive oil. Trans fats from seed oils negatively impact health. [\[Reference: Mozaffarian et al., 2006.\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8535577/)
3. **SAY NO TO ALCOHOL**: Excessive alcohol lowers testosterone. [\[Reference: Emanuele & Emanuele, 1998.\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8167819/)
4. **ADIOS TOBACCO AND DRUGS**: These destroy overall health and hormone levels, including vaping.
5. **Hydration**: Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Aim for 2 liters.
6. **Test Diet**: Focus on whole foods like eggs, red meat, butter, fruits, and vegetables. A diet rich in protein aids muscle building and weight loss, which support higher testosterone levels. Aim for 2x body weight in grams (e.g., 80kg = 160g protein).
7. **Raw or Fat Natural Milk & Coconut Water**: Highly beneficial.
8. **Coffee Intake**: Limit to morning hours, but drink **90 min after waking** to avoid disrupting sleep.

# Lifestyle Fixes:

1. **Weight Lifting (3-5 times a week)**: Boosts testosterone levels. Studies show resistance training enhances test production. [\[Reference: Ahtiainen et al., 2003.\]](https://dergipark.org.tr/en/download/article-file/1669373#:~:text=It%20was%20observed%20that%20testosterone%20increased%20not%20only%20with%20resistance,et%20al.%2C%202003)
2. **HIIT Training**: Short, intense bursts of activity boost testosterone.
3. **Bedroom Activities (Morning)**: Sexual activity (not self-induced) can influence testosterone levels. [\[Reference: van Anders et al., 2011.\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9293448/)
4. **Regular Movement**: Avoid sitting for prolonged periods – don't be lazy!
5. **Outdoor Activities**: Sunlight exposure is crucial for Vitamin D synthesis.

# Sleep is Essential Mate:

1. **Quality Sleep**: Invest in a comfortable bed and pillow – maintain a regular sleep schedule. Sleep is crucial for hormone regulation.
2. **Sleep Tracking**: Monitor sleep patterns for improvement. Devices like the Ultrahuman Ring help.

# Avoid Xenoestrogens & Estrogen-Like Substances:

1. **Personal Care & Household Products**: Found in some plastics, shampoos, deodorants, and toothpaste, these disrupt hormonal balance. [\[Reference: Darbre, 2006.\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3443608/)

# Stress Management:

1. **Cold Showers**: Finish each shower with 30-60 seconds of cold water. Be a man. Get used to it.
2. **Ice Baths (2-4 times a week)**: Boost resilience, recovery, general health, burns fat + boosts test. Cold exposure activates brown adipose tissue (BAT), which burns calories. [\[Reference: van der Lans et al., 2013.\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5411446/)
3. **Mindfulness & Relaxation**: Meditation helps manage stress by lowering cortisol, which destroys testosterone. If meditation isn’t for you, go for walks in nature.

# Fasting:

1. **Fasting Once a Week (24h) or Every Two Weeks (36h)**: Research suggests fasting has various health benefits, including potential testosterone impacts.
2. **Short-Term Fasting**: Increases LH (hormone stimulating testosterone production).[ \[Reference: Anderson et al., 1987.\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8092432/)
3. **Weight Loss & Testosterone**: Fasting can lead to reduced body fat, which indirectly raises test levels. [\[Reference: Ng Tang Fui et al., 2017.\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5944503/)

1iiz6g2,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1iiz6g2/i_think_my_roommate_is_abusive/,I think my roommate is abusive.,"So this sucks. I grew up in an abusive environment my entire life, and im now in my early 20s and made some friends on the internet that treated me like family. I thought i found my people i could feel at home with and loved and supported like they did me. They lived across the country and always talked about how i should move in with them and get out of my situation. They said theyd support me and help me get on my feet and that i needed a place of stability they could provide. Well when the abuse at home got really bad i decided to take up their offer and shipped all my stuff and flew out to live with them. But they didnt tell me my room was going to be essentially a large closet/small office. So if theres a fire im screwed and I get no sunlight so waking up is a struggle along with struggling with depression (i should also mention i had a parent recently die before flying out which has also impacted me greatly as they were a primary cause of my abuse). Its been almost a month of living here and i already want to flee. I hate that i even have to use that word. Theres 4 people here now including myself, my roomate, my roommates partner and their friend. When i first moved in it was made clear to me that the “friend” was considered a terrible roomate and they were talking about kicking this person out. My roomate well call them sam, would smear their friend to me very loudly so the friend could hear from the other room but refused to directly communicate with them and even asked me to do it for them even though i had only been there a few days. 

Now this was a small red flag to me but then sam and the friend seemed to get on better terms with each other and i havent heard sam say anything bad about them in a couple weeks. 

And its also probably important i mention that sam and their partner are on what id call rollercoaster terms. Ill wake up to them talking about how in love they are or atleast how in love sam thinks they are, then the next day theyre screaming at each other at the top of their lungs. Then a few hours later their chilling. Then screaming again. Like when i moved in, i noticed drip stains(like they had never been attempted to be cleaned too, not even stained) all over the walls in my room so i asked if it was mildew. I was informed it was coffee that had been thrown in a fight and they didnt care to clean it. Cool. The flags just keep flying. 

Now anytime i walk through the living room sam makes comments about how loud i walk, when everyone in the apartment walks the same volume. 

Oh and i should mention, maybe a week in to living with them, i wake up, sam and their partner are fighting, great, i decide im going to leave the house and get to know the area better so i dont have to hear it. I walk out, it gets quiet, i tell sam im going out and ask if they need anything while im gone since im going to some stores. Sam proceeds to scream at me “im good but if you could get me a gun to shoot myself that would be great bc this one *proceeds to verbally degrade partner while pointing at said partner*” 

I froze and then left the house in tears. I havent heard things like that since my last abuser. I didnt want to go home. I walked over 10,000 steps just so i didnt have to (ik 10k is a good daily goal but this was not normal for me at all) 

While i was out trying to clear my head, sam sent me paragraphs about how they only act like that bc their partner makes them feel so unloved when they love them so much. I go into fawn response and basically play relationship counselor for hours bc anytime i call them on their behavior sam will manipulate it into being okay for them to do like threatening to kill themselves and i dont want them to start screaming at me. And honestly i just want to curl in a ball and cry the whole time. 

Ive cried my eyes out everyday since. 
Now sam has started indirectly calling me a piece of shit and an asshole to my face and online, saying that theres too much shit in the house while clearly referring to me being that shit, saying im not doing anything (im actively applying for jobs and calling about them, going out every day-mainly to get out the house-, making art, etc) screaming about me to their partner while their partner engages in reactive abuse and trying to defend me and i hear it all from my bedroom. 

Sam barely speaks to me now and i avoid them any chance i can. Anytime i do see them they look at me like they hate me. 
I try to ask if theyre okay they say yes, then i hear more screaming about me later or the next day. 

Sam also loves to talk about how they can ruin anyone’s lives at a drop of a hat if they see fit but theyre a changed person and would never do that now, but wants people to know that they could and wants to be praised for not doing so. Which as im sure they want, terrifies me. 

Sam also owes me over $100 that im too scared to ask for. 

The last time sam was even nice to me is because they wanted me to buy them stuff, but now im a piece of shit.

I said to them before i moved i was scared they were going to hate me, they responded they could never even be mad at me and that theyd take care of me. 

I dont feel welcome to even leave my room. 

I want to go home. Sam texted me today and threatened to leave the house and get an air bnb bc no one gives a shit about them mainly their partner, when all they do is care for everyone. A few hours later, sams fine at home like nothing even happened and im hiding in my room trying to pack my stuff back up so i can actually get an air bnb and hopefully ship everything home before flying home.

I really thought this was going to be a start of a good life for me. Maybe if i had a job already i wouldnt have to fly home but i dont have enough to sustain a long term bnb stay till i do get a job and an apartment. 

I feel so stupid. I spent all this money and came all the way out here just to feel unsafe in my own existence and home. I cant even talk to myself because sam says it bothers them to the point they have to numb themselves, but before i moved they said they loved it about me.

It feels like the harry potter meme “ill be in my room making no noise and pretending i dont exist” thats been me for over a week now and im barely eating bc they also hate when im in the kitchen. I cant live in constant fear and anxiety like this and i cant see it getting better, only worse. 

I will not let them throw coffee or anything at me. I will not let them break my possessions. I will not let them scream at me. I will not let them call me names. I will not be blamed for their mental health and put my own at further risk. I will not be the scapegoat for their pain and the victim of their abuse to the point it makes me not want to live. I will not let them put me under their thumb. 

Am i fucking scared shitless about them seeing me pack my boxes and possibly telling them, and them throwing in my face that they think im being ungrateful and a peice of shit and smearing my name all over the internet and sending who knows what or who to my house, while saying its all bc theyre such a loving person and i deserve every shitty thing coming to me? Yeah. But isnt that just more reason to leave? 

Im starving, im sad, i have no friends (they got jealous of my last one and manipulated me into cutting them off), and ive never been more depressed and scared except maybe when my parent was dying. 

I miss when my friend was my friend to me. I hear them talk on the phone to a million new people everyday the same way they used to talk to me. With mutual kindness and understanding and i got your back energy.

I checked the Exchange server, and he did indeed have access to the mailboxes. There were still “traces” in the logs, despite the “clean-up” he'd done.

My problem now is to find these same traces in the linux mail server. Hopefully, he'll have been less cautious, counting on the fact that we don't know Linux as well as he does. I'm not trying to get him fired, just to make him understand that he has to stop, because it's unacceptable.

1iiz34p,https://www.reddit.com/r/twinpeaks/comments/1iiz34p/i_watched_twin_peaks_season_1_for_the_first/,I watched Twin Peaks Season 1 for the first time...just wanted to share my thoughts,"**SPOILERS for Season 1 in this post**


Twin Peaks is one of those classics of television that I've wanted to see for a long time but never really got around to it. Back in 2018 or so, I think, I watched the pilot, but then sort of slept on it.

But last week, I finally watched the first 8-episode season.

I can't say it was mind-blowingly awesome the way most successful contemporary shows are. I can't say my jaw dropped every episode due to some epic moment and twist. But watching Twin Peaks is certainly...an *experience*.

There's something sublime about the show. Something dream-like. Watching it feels like watching something while you're half-asleep, even if you're in fact wide awake. There's just a weird quality about it that settles in your subconsciousness rather than whacking you in the head.

On the surface, 90% of the time it plays like the sort of crime drama/small-town mystery show that became very popular last decade with the rise of Nordic Noir. But you feel like there's just something *off*, with the people acting weird (or rather, acting pretty normal and true-to-life, but 'weird' by TV standards), and the tonal swerves (the soundtrack alone sometimes makes it hard to take the show *too* seriously). Its all entertaining and eminently watchable, but in a pretty casual fashion, without the in-your-face intensity of the thousand or so shows that Twin Peaks probably inspired.

And then there's the supernatural stuff 10% of the time (or less) that does *hit* you, but only for the briefest of moments. It just adds further to the dream-like quality of the show. I think in Season 1, most of the time, its possible to imagine that the dreams are just Cooper's subconciousness presenting him with evidence from minor details and clues he's unconsciously picked up. Or that some kind of ESP is in play. Of course, there are hints towards some greater cosmic battle between Good and Evil beneath the surface, but the surface is very much the mundanity of small-town life (along with a heap of drug-dealing, prostitution, domestic violence, and murder).

Ultimately, its the characters - big and small - whom you really fall in love with. Normally, characters become archetypes with huge signposts as to what they stand for or where they're going. Here? We're just introduced to a bunch of quirky, weird but in their own ways, ordinary, *people* and we have to take them as they are. What's *really* going on with Audrey Horne for instance? On a lesser show, she'd have some intense character arc where we understand her specific motivations and how they change in some dramatic twist? Here...she kinda is what she is and does what she does and we have little idea why. Kinda like dealing with some interesting character in real life, isn't it?

By the same token, its hard to get a handle on Dale Cooper. One moment, he's the tough authoritative FBI agent, all-business. The next he's a guy raving about coffee and condiments! One moment, he's the by-the-book cop, the next he's conducting investigations based on dreams. But its not like there's any dramatic shift between all these different facets of his character...he just *is*. And everyone around him just seems to go with the flow, however weird it is, because in the final accounting, their lives aren't any less 'weird' than Dale is.

The thing which surprised me most is how little focus there is on the central mystery in these first 8 episodes. ""Who killed Laura Palmer?"" comes across a little as a McGuffin...an excuse to drive (or rather, subtly push) these characters towards doing what they do all season. The crime dramas of the past decade, inspired at least in part by Twin Peaks, are laser-focused on the central mystery and keep us on our toes, layering twist upon twist. Here? Cooper, Truman and co. slowly and methodically find stuff (though forensics or analyzing dreams of whatever) and gradually zero in on a couple of likely suspects over a few episodes, but there no mindblowing twists or sudden swerves thus far. The closest thing we get, in my view, to a sudden twist, is the reveal that Josie Packard is working with Ben Horne to betray Catherine and that she got her husband killed. And even these twists almost come off in an almost matter-of-fact way...just part of the flow, or the stream of subconcioussness, that is this show's narrative.

The character of Madeline adds to the dream-like quality of Twin Peaks for sure. Plus, I guess for practical reasons they needed to give Laura Palmer's actress something to do ;) That's another thing...in most of these crime dramas, you get to know the victim (either in an episode or two before the murder or through flashbacks). Here, we get to see very little of Laura and mostly *hear* about her - both about what a charitable, kind, almost angelic figure she was, and about what a messed up, damaged, drug-addicted, manipulative figure she was. In that sense, we are like Dale I suppose...we don't *know* this person whose murder investigation we are following. We just know what the evidence and the people who knew her tell us.

I dunno...is Laura Palmer symbolically representative of America? Its shining virtues that overlay its dark underbelly? Early on I felt that's what the show was trying to tell us, but who knows? I somehow doubt its that simple. Or maybe its even simpler than that?

Will most likely watch Season 2 in the near-future. I don't feel any urgency about it though. I guess that's what the dreaminess of Twin Peaks does to you...

1iiz30h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Btechtards/comments/1iiz30h/my_first_internship/,My first internship.,"Two years ago, I had the wonderful opportunity to intern at Siemens in Mumbai as an Electronics Engineering student, and I’d love to share my experience. I also have a question for those working in the industry is work life during internships similar to that of a fulltime job?

---

It all started in August 2022 during my 5th semester at Government Polytechnic Mumbai. Within the first week, our class teacher asked us to start searching for companies for our upcoming 6th semester, which was dedicated entirely to a 6-month internship.

By October, Siemens Mumbai visited our college to recruit for their internship program. They selected students from the Mechanical, Electrical, and Electronics departments. After the interview process, 4 of us were chosen from 30 Electronics Engineering applicants.

On January 2, 2023, all 37 selected interns from the three departments gathered in the company’s visitor room. We received our ID cards and were guided to a conference room where the HR team verified our mark sheets and assigned us to our respective departments.

My friend and I were assigned to the Medium Voltage Switchgear Factory. We met our manager, but he was on leave for the first 20 days. In his absence, a Graduate Engineer Trainee (GET) showed us around the factory, giving us a glimpse into how things operated.

When our assigned manager returned, I remember feeling intimidated by his authority. Employees instantly became more disciplined around him, listening attentively when he spoke. At that time, I was quite introverted, and this new environment felt overwhelming. My manager initially paid more attention to my friend and largely ignored me.

However, the employees around me were friendly, offering advice and sharing their experiences. We had a huge canteen, and food was included in the program. Meeting every morning at 8 AM for breakfast helped me build connections. Slowly, I began greeting colleagues and even got the courage to greet my manager daily. He would ask about the previous day’s work, and though it was challenging at first, slowly lost my fear and learned how to make small talk. This simple habit helped me develop friendships across the company—from the staff to the workers I met every day.

One of the biggest I loved was the strict 9 to 5 schedule. Once the clock hit 5 PM, work stayed at work. All employees had their evenings free to relax, pursue hobbies, or spend time with friends and family.
We also had access to a bus facility. I became friends with the bus driver, and he started picking me up and dropping me off right next to my building, even though it wasn’t on the official route. On days when I was the only one commuting, he would still drive me home without any complaints. Traveling alone in a company bus watching crowded public buses while having an entire bus to yourself was a unique experience.

In February, a B.Tech graduate from another city joined as an intern for three months. He was almost done with his degree and already had a job offer. He was extroverted and super smart, and through him, I learned how to initiate conversations, be bold, and interact confidently with people. His influence helped me break out of my shell, and together, we started exploring the factory, talking to people, and learning how things worked.

That same month,  was the stock checking for all inventory materials, both of us were put to the task. I was given 4 warehouse workers to supervise while my friend was working with others. The task was to communicate with them, communicate with the forklift operator to remove and put back the racks stored on the shelfs, while making sure no one gets hurt, all items are being counted properly, the workers are not doing time pass and to finish the work on time.

I remember my initial few hours with them, how difficult it was as someone who’s never done this before, after some friendly talks we started building trust and we slowly completed the stock counting of the entire warehouse racks. This marked the beginning of our relation with the warehouse workers. After that they stopped behaving rudely with us, started speaking nicely, having chit chats, showing us stuff, telling out their personal life, etc. That’s how we made friends with almost 70 people in the warehouse. We made friends with the supervisors of the two assembly lines, they taught us everything related to logistics.
We would spend time with them everyday. Now the warehouse workers even started inviting us for snacks which they would bring everyday. They celebrated my Birthday and we had a lot of celebrations together. By this time, almost everyone in the factory knew us, it had become a routine of ours. 

Our daily routine: meeting in the canteen for breakfast, again for lunch, and once more for afternoon tea. We had fun alongside work drinking coffee in the cafeteria each hour, roaming the campus after lunch, visiting different buildings within the plant. It felt like everyone knew us, from HR to the assembly line workers. I enjoyed it so much that I even started coming in on public holidays and Saturdays just to hang out with the workers and enjoy the food.

As my confidence grew, my manager’s attitude towards me shifted dramatically. From ignoring me initially, he began focusing on me, often seeking my opinion before my friend’s and assigning me tasks directly. On the final day, he addressed me exclusively, offering to help with future job opportunities, barely acknowledging my friend.


Our 6 months at Siemens flew by. As a 19-year-old, this internship was a life-changing experience. I made more connections and learned more about people in these six months than I had in my entire life up to that point. It taught me communication, teamwork, and confidence. 

Now that I’m pursuing my B.Tech at a private college, I wonder if I’ll get to experience something like this again.

We scoured loads of Trustpilot reviews to get real feedback on **VeryNaughty**, and the results aren’t pretty.

The main issue? Fake profiles, endless chat loops designed to drain your wallet, and women who seem to be online 24/7 but never actually meet up.

For those who want a legitimate alternative to **VeryNaughty**, check out our list of the [top hookup apps](https://www.stevejabba.com/top-dating-apps-sj/).

# 🚨 The Profiles Are Totally Fake 🚨

**Tim Crawford** – ""Total SCAM. Rip off. Bogus profiles. Profile found on other sites. Profiles don't even know what their picture looks like. SCAM.""

If you’ve got a good eye, you might notice something weird—familiar faces from other websites! Yep, recycled profiles seem to be a thing here, making it pretty obvious the site is just baiting users.

# 💬 They Just Want You to Keep Chatting 💬

**Nicolas** – ""The women show lots of interest but always try to keep chatting, never replying to your messages properly. It's as if they’re getting paid for every message you write them.""

This is a classic scam tactic—keeping you engaged just long enough to drain your wallet on paid messages. But don’t expect an actual date; you’ll just get strung along indefinitely.

# 📵 No One Will Give You a Phone Number or Meet Up 📵

**Greg LANZ** – ""The girls never meet up for dates. Won’t give any phone numbers or anything… they answer at all hours of the day, like they never sleep. Total scam, stay away.""

If someone’s *always* online but never available in real life, there’s a good chance you’re not talking to a real person. Bots? Paid chat operators? Either way, you’re not getting that date.

# 💸 Coin System = Money Pit 💸

**Jesper Lauritsen** – ""Fake. Just want you to buy coins. Fake profiles. Seen many of the profile photos on XHamster.""

The coin system is designed to suck you dry. Every message costs money, and since the profiles aren’t even real, you’re essentially paying to talk to a ghost.

# 📍 Fake Locations & Odd Details 📍

**Bob** – ""Some women make comments about how nice an area is… the area was in Poland. Others use keyboards with accents that aren’t possible on a US keyboard. Women claim to speak fluent Spanish and English, but their profiles have odd spelling.""

When ""local"" women start talking about places thousands of miles away, you know something’s off. VeryNaughty isn’t even trying to make these profiles believable.

# ❌ Profiles Are Active 24/7—Because They’re Fake ❌

**Michael Ferris** – ""I think it is a total scam. Same women, always on, day and night. I spent loads and never achieved a cup of coffee. Waste of money.""

A real person has a job, a social life, and, you know… sleeps. But on **VeryNaughty**, women seem to be online *all the time*. Huge red flag!

# 🤦‍♂️ Naked Profiles, But No Action 🤦‍♂️

**Joe** – ""I joined, and lots of naked women… after two days, I figured it’s a scam. One woman said she was interested but kept telling me to buy more coins. Then she said she didn’t have a phone. That’s when I figured it out—it's a scam site. Do not join it.""

They’ll tease you with explicit pics but will never take things offline. Instead, they’ll just push you to spend more money on messages.

# 🤯 ""Women"" Who Don’t Even Speak the Language 🤯

**James Sirois** – ""If you look at the profiles, they all say they can speak English and French. I’m a Frenchman. I tried… got all deflections. It’s a scam. Save your money. Don’t do as I did.""

Another trick? Claiming to be bilingual but failing to hold a basic conversation. When even Google Translate could do a better job, you know something’s fishy.

# 📸 Stolen Photos Galore 📸

**Helmut E Weiss** – ""Yes, this is all B.S. THE WOMEN LOOK GREAT BUT NOT REAL. GATHERED PHOTOS. SCAMMERS.""

Many users have reported seeing the same profile pictures across multiple sites. In reality, these ""women"" probably don’t even know they’re being used as bait.

# ❗ The Final Verdict ❗

**VeryNaughty** certainly appears to be a scam.

If you're looking for a legit hookup app, try our [**top hookup apps instead**](https://www.stevejabba.com/top-dating-apps-sj/).

We keep this list up to date, **so you can at least get some dates with women in your local area without getting scammed!**

1iiz06s,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1iiz06s/the_valiant_victor_sable/,The Valiant Victor Sable,"Once upon a time, there was a man named Victor Sable. He lived in a house that looked like any other suburban mansion. On the outside, it had white brick walls, a manicured lawn, and a welcoming front porch. But anyone who got close enough to examine it would quickly realize that this wasn’t any ordinary house. It was a fortress that could withstand a nuclear blast, was equipped with every security measure known to mankind, and boasted technology centuries ahead of its time—technology that Victor had invented.

Victor’s home was his sanctuary, but not because it was safe. He didn’t need protection from the outside world. He had no fear. The walls of his house could stop missiles, the floors were lined with quantum-shielding materials, and his front door boasted a series of eighty locks, each requiring a different biometric scan to open. But none of this mattered much to him. Victor didn’t care about safety. He cared about boredom.

You see, Victor was a man who had everything. Power, wealth, knowledge—anything he wanted, he could have. He didn’t need to leave his house for food because he had created a food replicator straight out of Star Trek that produced gourmet meals on demand. He didn’t need friends because he could send a thought out into the world and command anyone to do his bidding. But after a while, everything began to feel... too easy. He wanted something to break the monotony.

So one lazy Thursday afternoon, while sipping a cup of coffee that he materialized out of thin air, he decided it was time for some fun.

Victor stretched out on his couch, looking at his huge red button labeled ""Shut Up"" on the table in front of him. It was a little ridiculous, but that was exactly the point. It was his joke to the universe—a button that he didn’t need, but pressed anyway just to remind everyone of his limitless power. He smirked, tapping it once. The button lit up, and a series of high-tech missiles—undetectable to any radar system—sprang to life. They launched from hidden silos beneath his mansion, ready to go wherever he wished.

“Let’s see…” he murmured, scrolling through his mental map of the world. “How about... the Eiffel Tower?”

A moment later, with a casual thought, the missiles were aimed and on their way. With a soft whoosh, they rocketed across the globe, dodging every known defense system. The French government had no idea what was happening. In mere seconds, the Eiffel Tower was obliterated in a series of fiery explosions. The famous Parisian landmark crumbled into dust, not even a smoldering ruin left behind.

Victor grinned and reclined back into his chair. “I’ve been meaning to do that,” he muttered, watching the explosion unfold on the news through his custom-built satellite feed.

The world was in chaos, but Victor didn’t care. He wasn’t a tyrant. He wasn’t trying to conquer the world—he just couldn’t resist. What else was there to do when you had the power to make the world bow to your will? Everyone else could worry about the consequences while he enjoyed his popcorn.

The phone rang. It was the French president, who had just learned of the Tower’s destruction.

“Mr. Sable,” the president said, his voice shaking. “We know you did it. You have to stop—what do you want? Please, just name your terms!”

Victor laughed softly. “What’s the point? I don’t need anything. I just got bored.”

The president, who was no stranger to global threats, was completely dumbfounded. Bored? You could blow up a symbol of France’s heritage just because you were bored?

“Why not try something else for fun? How about... oh, I don’t know, the Great Wall of China? That one’s been standing for a while.”

A few minutes later, Victor’s missiles took out another world-famous landmark, but this time, he thought he might be a little too bored. He needed to be more creative.

Victor grabbed the red button again. “Fine. Time to really spice things up,” he muttered to himself, this time launching a series of orbital lasers that started slowly dismantling the moon. It wasn’t enough to destroy it, but it would send massive chunks of lunar debris flying into space, causing a spectacular show. It was subtle in a way that only Victor’s sense of humor would appreciate.

For the next few hours, the world had no idea what was happening. The governments were scrambling to figure out what had just happened, why all their top-secret systems had failed, and how the Eiffel Tower and a part of the Great Wall had been erased from existence.

Meanwhile, Victor was reclining in his favorite chair, scrolling through a list of possible new toys for himself. He ordered a set of hyper-advanced drones that could predict the movements of anyone within a five-mile radius and silently bring them coffee. It was all fun to him, a way to kill time when the world felt too small.

By nightfall, his phone buzzed again. This time it was the U.N. They wanted a meeting with him, to discuss his actions. But Victor didn’t even bother to answer. Instead, he pressed the ""Shut Up"" button again, sending another missile into the air, just in case they were thinking about having a conversation.

His reputation as a world-shaping, untouchable figure was sealed. But for Victor, it wasn’t about taking over the world—it was about having fun with it.

Victor Sable didn’t need power. He had it in spades. But sometimes, even the most powerful men just need something to do.

And for him, that something was blowing up landmarks... just because he could.

The world had learned by now that never to challenge Victor Sable. But that didn’t stop them from trying. After the Eiffel Tower and the Great Wall of China were little more than distant memories, nations began to convene. They knew that taking down Victor wasn’t just a matter of sending some well-armed agents to his front door. This man had the power to obliterate anything, anywhere, anytime.

So, as Victor sat in his giant, plush chair, watching yet another Star Trek episode on a screen that projected holograms around him, he received a message from every government in the world. They were all fed up. They were tired of him treating global landmarks like toys, and the world’s leaders had finally agreed on one thing: It was time to end Victor Sable’s reign of boredom.

The phone rang, and for once, Victor didn’t answer immediately. Instead, he simply let it ring, chuckling to himself.

“Everyone’s getting the same idea, huh?” he murmured, amused. He picked up the phone, lazily flipping the screen on. The voice on the other end was frantic, shaking with the fear that only an international crisis could induce.

“Victor Sable, this is the United Nations. The world is coming together. We’re launching everything. Every missile silo across the globe is aimed at your location right now. It’s the only way. We’ve—""

Victor interrupted with a lazy wave of his hand. “Sure, sure. You all can try, but you’re going to need more than a few missiles to ruin my day.”

He hit the button to cut off the call, took a sip from his custom-made “World’s Best Boss” mug (created using his food replicator technology), and thought for a moment. He was getting a little bored of the cat-and-mouse game. It was time for a little fun—his kind of fun.

From his high-tech control panel, he smirked as he activated his personal security system. Every missile flying toward him was immediately intercepted by a massive pulse of energy from his mansion. It wasn’t just any energy; it was a field of pure quantum entanglement, altering the trajectory of each missile as they hit it.

The missiles from every country suddenly froze mid-air. Time itself seemed to warp for a brief moment. And then, they were no longer missiles—they were… cheeseburgers. Perfectly cooked cheeseburgers, with buns, melted cheese, pickles, and a little bit of ketchup and mustard. Hundreds of thousands of them, all falling from the sky in slow motion.

Victor looked out the window, grinning. “Now that’s what I call a meal.”

Around the globe, leaders were on their knees, staring at the screens in horror. The entire missile salvo—every single warhead from every major country—had been converted into cheeseburgers in mid-flight. What had been a moment of global military unity had been reduced to a bizarre culinary spectacle.

“Victor,” the U.N. representative began again, his voice shaking. “This… this is madness. What have you done? We launched everything at you! We thought we’d finally end this madness!”

Victor’s voice was casual, almost bored. “Oh, I just gave them a little tweak while they were on their way. You’re welcome, by the way. I’ll bet those cheeseburgers are delicious. Oh, and I turned some of them into vegan options for anyone who might have dietary restrictions.”

The representative had no words. Meanwhile, leaders across the globe watched as every missile, every attempt at retaliation, had failed spectacularly. The entire world now realized that trying to take down Victor wasn’t just impossible—it was laughable.

Having deatomized the missiles and turned them into cheeseburgers, Victor wasn’t done. He needed something more. Something bigger. Something that would entertain him for a while.

He leaned back in his chair, eyes twinkling with mischief. “What if I just…?” His thought trailed off, and in the blink of an eye, he pulled up an advanced, secret military satellite feed. Victor could see every single military installation on Earth, and with a thought, he brought them all into his mental grasp.

All of them.

Every military base in the world, with their nuclear codes and weapons systems, now at his disposal. No one could do anything about it. He wasn’t just untouchable anymore—he was everywhere, with complete control over everything.

Victor smiled, pleased with his own work. “Yeah… I think I’ll just let them wait for a while.”

With a single thought, he made all the world leaders who had tried to confront him think that they were stuck in an endless, looping phone call with him, where all he said was, “What’s up?” and “No, I’m good.”

By the end of the day, Victor sat back, relaxed and content. The world had tried to fight him. The world had united against him. And yet, here he was, lounging in his mansion, watching Netflix, waiting for the next great boredom to hit. The governments could try again, but at this point, they were just a source of amusement.

Victor Sable didn’t need anything. He didn’t need to conquer the world—he already owned it.

And if he got a little bored one day? Well, there was always a button, a missile, or a cheeseburger to fix that.",1,1738835489.0,creativewriting,1,1.0,False

A well-designed space not only enhances the overall ambiance but also leaves a lasting impression on visitors. 

High-quality hotel furniture plays a crucial role in achieving that premium look and feel. Whether you are renovating an existing property or starting fresh, selecting the right furniture can make all the difference.

https://preview.redd.it/c4wml8g5qhhe1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=732da8ab61225146e4ffee3c546da48fcaa2a6cc

# Choose High-Quality Materials

The foundation of a luxurious hotel interior lies in the materials used. Opt for premium-quality wood, metal, marble, and upholstery that exude elegance and durability. Investing in handcrafted furniture from reputed **hotel furniture suppliers** ensures that each piece is not only stylish but also long-lasting. Velvet, leather, and high-thread-count fabrics add a touch of sophistication to lobbies, suites, and dining areas.

# Focus on Elegant and Timeless Designs

Luxury is often associated with classic and timeless designs. Instead of following short-lived trends, opt for furniture that blends traditional charm with contemporary appeal. Elegant headboards, sleek chairs, and statement lighting can transform any space into a five-star experience. If you are working on a restaurant or lounge area, collaborating with **restaurant furniture suppliers** can help you find designs that complement the hotel's theme while maintaining a high-end aesthetic.

# Create a Grand Entrance

The hotel lobby is the first point of interaction for guests, making it essential to create a stunning first impression. A well-designed lobby should include plush seating, grand chandeliers, and a welcoming ambiance. Luxurious furniture pieces, such as oversized sofas and designer coffee tables, can elevate the look of the space. Attention to detail, such as decorative cushions and statement rugs, adds to the grandeur.

# Incorporate Statement Pieces

Statement furniture pieces serve as the focal point of any room, drawing attention and enhancing the overall aesthetic. A beautifully crafted reception desk, an eye-catching lounge chair, or a sculptural coffee table can set the tone for a luxurious setting. Partnering with **Best of Exports**, known for their exquisite collection, can help you source unique statement pieces that stand out while maintaining comfort and functionality.

# Enhance Outdoor Spaces with Premium Furniture

Luxury extends beyond the interiors of a hotel. Outdoor areas such as patios, poolside lounges, and rooftop bars should also reflect the elegance of the property. High-end outdoor furniture, made from weather-resistant materials, ensures durability while maintaining an upscale appearance. Working with **outdoor furniture manufacturers** allows hoteliers to find stylish yet sturdy pieces that can withstand different weather conditions while adding to the beauty of the outdoor setting.

# Pay Attention to Comfort and Functionality

While aesthetics are important, comfort should never be compromised. Guests expect hotel furniture to be visually appealing yet highly functional. Ergonomically designed chairs, cozy sofas, and plush bedding contribute to a luxurious and comfortable stay. High-end furniture brands focus on striking the perfect balance between style and comfort, ensuring that guests enjoy their experience to the fullest.

# Utilize Luxurious Color Palettes

Color plays a significant role in setting the mood of a space. Rich hues such as deep blues, emerald greens, and royal golds create a lavish ambiance. Neutral tones with metallic accents add sophistication and make the space feel more refined. Coordinating furniture colors with the overall theme of the hotel enhances visual harmony and makes the interiors feel more cohesive.

# Personalization and Customization

To stand out in the hospitality industry, hotels must offer something unique. Custom furniture allows you to design pieces that align perfectly with your brand identity and vision. Many **hotel furniture suppliers** offer customization options, allowing hoteliers to choose fabrics, finishes, and designs that reflect their specific style. Custom furniture also ensures that each space has a distinct and exclusive look.

# Lighting and Accessories Matter

Luxury is all about the details. Elegant lighting fixtures such as chandeliers, pendant lights, and wall sconces can dramatically enhance the ambiance of a space. Decorative accessories like art pieces, mirrors, and designer vases add a touch of sophistication. Soft lighting, when combined with premium furniture, creates an inviting and relaxing atmosphere that appeals to guests.

# Conclusion

Creating a luxurious look with hotel furniture requires a combination of high-quality materials, timeless designs, comfort, and attention to detail. By investing in premium pieces from reputable [Hotel Room Chairs](https://bestofexports.com/hotel-furniture/hotel-chairs/room-chairs/) **suppliers**, hotels can achieve an upscale aesthetic that attracts and retains guests. Whether it's the lobby, guest rooms, dining areas, or outdoor spaces, the right furniture choices can transform a hotel into a true luxury destination.",1,1738835347.0,u_One_Scallion_6415,0,1.0,False

I'm usually not into fruity coffees, but this brew was really good. I've tried plenty of different ones, many from renowned roasters, but I was truly surprised by the depth and balanced flavors of this one.

I've tried it twice - once with V60 and once with AeroPress (according to the recipe in the image) - and both yielded great results.

It's a Colombian Tabi bean with tropical/citrusy flavors. The reason I like this coffee so much is the balance between acidity and a nice afterhint of tropical fruits. There's some sweetness to it as well, but not too much - just perfectly balanced with the rest of the notes. What really stands out is the timing of how quickly the acidity shifts to the aftertaste. It feels so cohesive in a way I haven't experienced in a long time.

The preparation was simple. Using the inverted AeroPress method, I went with high temperature water and a longer steep time. After about 2 minutes, I gave it a small stir (not swirl, important!) before pressing.

I can't recommend Swerl enough. Try it out and let me know what you think! :)",3,1738835245.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

1iiyti4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creepytaters/comments/1iiyti4/monstrous_chapter_5_monsters_assemble/,Monstrous Chapter 5: Monsters Assemble,"The overhead light flickered and buzzed, casting uneven shadows that danced like restless specters across the dingy walls of the PHANTOM briefing room. Each burst of light sharpened the cracks in the plaster, every jagged edge and flaw revealed in merciless detail. The air reeked of burnt electronics, stale coffee, and oil—a suffocating cocktail that clung to the throat. Cigarette smoke curled lazily upward, the haze thick enough to feel alive, whispering secrets to those brave enough to listen. This wasn’t a room for idle conversation; it was a battlefield for words, and the monsters seated around the table were its soldiers.

Dodogoran crouched low, his massive frame consuming the space. His skin shimmered faintly, an otherworldly blend of metallic sheen and scaly texture, as though forged in some hellish crucible. Claws the size and shape of grasshooks tapped against the cracked tiles, a steady, rhythmic countdown to some unspoken doom. His six glowing red eyes darted around the room, their predatory focus lingering on each occupant just long enough to make them feel exposed. When his jagged jaw twisted into a grin, it wasn’t clear if it promised amusement or carnage.

Tozok sat cross-legged on the floor, hunched forward to avoid the ceiling, his tusks gleaming in the dim light. The chitinous plates on his shoulders clicked faintly with each subtle movement, a sound like distant thunder rolling across the plains. His claws scraped shallow grooves into the floor, the slow, deliberate gesture of a beast marking its territory. He shot a single glance at Dodogoran, irritation flashing briefly in his dark eyes before fading back into simmering disinterest.

Mimicron leaned back in his chair, the faint glow of his cigarette illuminating his sharp, angular features. Shadows danced across his face, shifting with every flicker of the light above, giving him an almost spectral appearance. He twirled the cigarette between his gloved fingers before taking a slow drag, the ember flaring briefly. Smoke spiraled upward, defying the weak currents of air, as he watched the others with a calculated smirk. His foot tapped against the table leg in an irregular rhythm, betraying a restless energy at odds with his otherwise calm demeanor.

Opposite them sat Gamaciel—or, as he currently called himself, John Barnes. His flawless steel-gray suit gleamed faintly under the flickering light, a sharp contrast to the room’s decay. One hand smoothed his lapel while the other tapped a fountain pen against a pristine yellow notepad. Everything about him spoke of precision, from his immaculate posture to the faint, knowing smile that hinted at centuries of unseen experience. His eyes—sharp and metallic—moved slowly from one occupant to the next, dissecting them with surgical efficiency.

The door creaked open, and Voss strode in with a purpose that sliced through the thick atmosphere like a knife. His tailored suit hung just slightly loose, his tie undone, giving him the air of a man too busy putting out fires to care about appearances. His sharp eyes scanned the room, assessing each mercenary in turn before landing on the young man trailing nervously behind him. Marcus clutched a battered clipboard to his chest like a shield, his knuckles white against the edges. His wide eyes flicked from Dodogoran’s serrated claws to Tozok’s hulking frame, pausing briefly on Mimicron’s cigarette and Gamaciel’s unnervingly composed expression. He swallowed hard, his Adam’s apple bobbing visibly, as though he were a rabbit realizing too late that it had wandered into a den of wolves.

Voss clapped his hands sharply, the sound snapping through the tension like a gunshot. “Alright, listen up.”

Marcus flinched, his grip on the clipboard tightening. Mimicron exhaled a thin stream of smoke, his lips curling into the faintest sneer as he turned his gaze back to the table.

“We’ve got our first mission,” Voss announced, pacing the length of the table as he slapped a folder against his palm. The worn leather of his shoes scuffed against the floor, the sound punctuating his words. He stopped abruptly and dropped the folder in front of Gamaciel, who raised an eyebrow but said nothing.

“Black Hollow, Alaska,” Voss began, his tone brisk, every word clipped and precise. “Small mining town. Population: eighty-three. Two weeks ago, they reported a fog rolling in from the mountains. Normal for the area. Then people started disappearing.” He tapped the folder for emphasis. “Reports of shadowy figures, strange noises, and other… unexplainable phenomena. Three days ago, the entire town went dark. Satellite images show the place is now covered in some kind of mist that we believe is blocking any form of communication. We sent a recon team two days ago, and…” He paused, his jaw tightening. “We lost contact.”

Dodogoran’s claws stopped tapping. He leaned forward, the serrated edges of his grin widening. “Sounds like prey,” he growled, his voice deep and guttural, reverberating through the room like distant thunder. “Big prey.”

Tozok snorted, his tusks flashing in the dim light. “Whateva it iz, i’ll krush it. No fog kin stop me.” His voice was heavy, each word weighted with unshakable confidence.

“Great,” Mimicron said dryly, taking another drag from his cigarette. He blew the smoke out in a thin, lazy stream. “We’re ghostbusters now. Do we get proton packs, or are we just winging it?”

“You’ll improvise,” Voss replied, ignoring the sarcasm. “Your objectives are simple: investigate, neutralize, and make sure no one else finds out about this. The fog’s cutting off all signals, so once you’re in, you’re on your own.”

“Neutralize, you say?” Gamaciel’s voice cut through the room, smooth and refined, tinged with a faint English accent. He opened the folder with deliberate care, his steel-gray eyes scanning the contents. “Sounds delightfully straightforward.” He looked up, his gaze settling on Marcus, who shrank under the weight of it. “Assuming our junior agent here doesn’t faint at the first sign of trouble.”

Marcus’s face turned a furious shade of red. “I-I won’t faint!” he stammered, his voice cracking slightly.

Dodogoran’s laugh rumbled low and menacing. “Good. Stay conscious. If something eats you, I want to watch.”

“Enough,” Voss snapped, his tone sharp enough to cut through the rising tension. He turned to Marcus, who looked like he wanted to melt into the floor. “You’re staying on comms. Let these guys handle the dirty work.”

Marcus nodded quickly, his eyes fixed on the floor as though making eye contact with anyone might be the death of him.

Voss took a deep breath, his hand lingering on the folder for a moment too long. He looked around the room, his gaze lingering on each mercenary before finally settling on Marcus. When he spoke again, his voice was low, almost a whisper, but it carried the weight of a command.

“You’ll either get the job done,” Voss said, “or blow that whole town off the map. Either way, it’s mission accomplished.”

The room went silent, the weight of Voss’s words hanging heavy in the air. Even the flickering light seemed to dim, as though recoiling from the grim reality of the order. There was no room for sentimentality in PHANTOM’s operations—only results.

Dodogoran’s grin widened, his jagged teeth glinting ominously as he slowly dragged a claw across the table, leaving a deep, smoking groove in the wood. “Burn it all,” he rumbled, the words dripping with savage delight. “Now that’s a mission I can enjoy.”

Tozok snorted again, the sound reverberating through the room like a distant avalanche. “If there’s nothing left to burn when I’m done, don’t cry about it.” He cracked his knuckles, the sharp sound echoing like bones snapping.

Mimicron, ever the cool pragmatist, extinguished his cigarette in the nearest ashtray, grinding it down with deliberate slowness. His smirk remained fixed as he glanced at Voss. “We’re walking into a blackout town with no intel, no backup, and no idea what’s waiting for us. I’ll assume the budget for body bags isn’t coming out of my paycheck.”

“Body bags won’t be necessary,” Gamaciel interjected, his voice calm, each word measured. He closed the folder and slid it back to Voss with a faint metallic scrape. “Whatever waits for us in that fog will fall. It always does.”

Marcus shifted uncomfortably, his throat working to swallow his growing anxiety. “What… what if it’s something we can’t fight? Something beyond—”

“Beyond us?” Mimicron interrupted, raising an eyebrow as he leaned forward, his voice a low, mocking drawl. “Kid, look around you. This isn’t the squad they send when they’re worried about ‘beyond.’ We are the something they call when everything else has failed.”

The young agent’s face paled further, but he didn’t respond. Voss ignored him, fixing his attention on the mercenaries. “Gear up,” he ordered, stepping back from the table. “We move in ten. And remember—if it breathes, bleeds, or moves, it’s a threat. No hesitation.”

As the group rose, the faint screech of chairs against the floor was drowned by the weight of anticipation. Dodogoran’s claws clinked against the ground as he lumbered toward the door, his presence casting an oppressive shadow over the others. “Let’s see what kind of screams this town can give us,” he growled, his voice thick with unrestrained hunger.

Tozok cracked his neck, his massive shoulders rolling like shifting boulders. “I don’t kare what’s wait'n ‘n 'dat fog,” he said, the chitin along his arms flexing and clicking in response to his movements. “It’ll be krushed, broken, an' buried unda ma feet.”

Mimicron grabbed his coat, slinging it over his shoulder with practiced ease. He glanced at Marcus, his grin sharp enough to cut. “Cheer up, rookie. This could be the last day of your life, and you’re wasting it looking scared.”

Marcus didn’t reply, his voice swallowed by the lump in his throat.

Gamaciel lingered for a moment longer, adjusting his cufflinks as though preparing for an elegant dinner rather than a descent into the unknown. His eyes, gleaming like tempered steel, lingered on Voss. “If this fog truly is unnatural, as you suspect… I hope you’ve considered the possibility that it might not end with the town.”

Voss’s expression hardened, the lines of his face drawn taut. “That’s why you’re going,” he said simply. “To make sure it does.”

With that, the group left the room, their footsteps a strange symphony of power and menace. Each mercenary carried with them a unique aura, but together, they were an unstoppable storm—a clash of monstrous wills united under one purpose: destruction.

And somewhere, far to the north, the black mist churned and writhed, as though it, too, could sense what was coming.

We met mid November 2024, he is in an admin job at my school and not responsible for grading. I’m mid 20s and he’s mid thirties; so an age gap but we have similar maturity. Sometimes when students are missing he joins projects and we’ve worked together. I see him a few days every month so it’s not frequent enough to be serious. 

The problem: 
Every time I see him the tension is really bad. He looks at me intensely and curiously and I also blush a lot which is so annoying. We always greet each other smiling and he sometimes winks but small talk feels embarrassing and awkward. We have similar beliefs and styles and we’re actually both nice friendly people normally! I think he’s so hot and interesting but now we kind of ignore each other and I avoid him since it feels so strange and now he probably thinks I’m rude.

Last month he added me on Facebook and later I followed him on Instagram and right away he followed me back and liked some older pictures. He also likes the stories I make with me in them. 

Does he think I’m not interested because I avoid him so this is why he doesn’t message me? Or would it be because it’s at school? I think I’m the problem, but not sure how to fix this… should I email him if he wants to go for coffee or something?",1,1738834617.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

In my opinion, for Kylea, it is about reminding her 150k+ followers ad nauseum how much Birdie loves the local coffee shop parking lot and listening to 🎶.  After that, there is shopping to be done, sometimes on a specific time limit, sometimes not. 

In image #3, Kylea claims that once she or Joe are awake, ""Birdie Mae is up for the rest of the day ready to play because she is a 10 month old puppy with a lot of energy.""

⏸️ While I agree that puppies have energy bursts, they also sleep for significant periods of time over the course of 24 hours (see image #4, photo credit AKC).  

Can we all agree that the Birdie Mae portrayed on social media is subdued?  When has this dog done the zoomies (a sudden burst of energy) or showed us puppy play time shenanigans?  

⏸️ Has her routine or schedule been shared and/or updated as she grows?  Where is the meaningful content? 👀 

Finally, please see image #5.  Remember, that at least at one time, Birdie Mae had a kennel crate.  It is Kylea's choice for Birdie Mae to sleep in their bed and on her/their pillow(s).  

Food for thought: How would Birdie Mae adjust if Kylea were ever hospitalized overnight?  Hospitals have the legal right to deny an ESA (emotional support animal) access to their facility.  

Here's a resource from petMD on establishing a sleep routine for your puppy: 📎 https://www.petmd.com/dog/general-health/puppy-sleep-schedule

1iiyr22,https://www.reddit.com/r/VillainyGroup/comments/1iiyr22/the_villainy_of_stinky_ooze/,The Villainy of Stinky Ooze,">It's like a little puff of summer on the otherwise vaguely mechanised and stale office breeze. A scintillant of redolence, a sudden mistral out of the headachy doldrums, a bright note against the flat olfactory wasteland. A triviality of citrus in the fog.

[Stinky Ooze](https://preview.redd.it/jmt113h8nhhe1.png?width=1313&format=png&auto=webp&s=9fc4ae3f5d2ff4fcd3d7c785b0a964d87dec82d4)

That's the idea of a perfume, anyway. The ideal. The vision of a confident person in a loose summer clothing casting about them a delightful air of springtime and warmth. The fact that you're picking all this up while they're still at the other end of the office is potentially problematic... because at a certain level, the hints become insistent, and the notes become angry honks.

The ideal is not always the reality.

Still... the eyewatering amount of Poisson por Femme that Veronica is wearing is surely better than Graham's three-day-old socks, right?

Maybe, but soon it's like being tear-gassed, and you might think that you'd rather stick your nose up a beaver's bum-hole, or get a face-full of whale barf, than spend one more moment being gassed by $100 a bottle fragrances, somewhat too liberally applied.

Well, you're in luck, because there's a good chance that's exactly what's happening already... if it's a traditional perfume.

There are several dodgy main ingredients in traditional perfumes - and in all fairness, there are plenty of fragrances which - in the modern era - don't use this stuff anymore... but there are plenty which still do - so, let's explore them in their utter loveliness:

# Ambergris

>I mean, it sounds delightful, doesn't it? Amber is a lovely colour, and it smells very nice. That's what this is all about, right?

Noooo.

You see, you know how squid are beaky little buggers - particularly the big ones - and those beaks can be very sharp indeed. It turns out that Sperm Whales (Physeter macrocephalus) eat large squid, and in order to avoid their stomachs being scissored to pieces by bits of sharp (and at this point very dead) squid, their internal organs secrete a goo to coat the sharp stuff, which they then later either vomit up, or poo out. It floats, so it washes up on beaches.

>Incidentally, and totally off the beaten track here, in an unusual design choice, a squid brain is donut shaped, and its esophagus runs through the hole. If a squid were to ever bite off more than it can chew, it can literally give itself brain damage.

At first, ambergris smells like you'd expect whale poo to smell, but when you age it... well, it's apparently highly sought after. It's used as a fixative, so that - even though it has its own contribution to the perfume's smell, it allows that smell to linger... er... longer.

Dogs absolutely love the stuff. They'll happily roll around in it all day, so people will often use dogs to find ambergris - a big chunk of which can be worth a small fortune.

# Civet

>Well that sounds nice, doesn't it? Like 'citrus' or something? It's got to be something fruity or clean-smelling, with a name like that, yeah?

Not so much.

People who own cats will know that if you're lying down on the sofa, maybe watching TV or reading a book, your friendly little housecat will happily clamber all over you, turn around, lift its tail, and wink at you with its freckle.

It might do this to your boss on a zoom meeting too, if you're not quick enough.

In proximity to that freckle, in some cats, are some glands which the animals use to spray, to let other cats know that ""this thing I've just put goo on is mine"". Even if it's yours.

In my experience, this will involve everything from expensive computer keyboards to my cup of freshly brewed coffee.

With most cats, it's just a squirt of yuck, but in the case of the African Civet (Civettictis civetta) it's just the ticket when it comes to formulating a winning perfume.

The stinkologists don't wait for the civet to squirt their expensive goo onto things though. They'll capture the animal, and then scrape the goo from the glands. It's not fatal, and a typical civet will produce around 3-4 grams of the stuff per week.

It's not just the smell of this stuff that's foul (it is described as ""strongly fecal"", which is how I describe a lot of people, to be fair) but the farming practices associated with it are unpleasant too.

When you dilute the civet goo (a lot) it fades from ""EW! POO!"" to ""Mmm! Musky!"", and is used as a fixative (like Ambergris) and a 'base note' to add depth and warmth to a perfume.

# Castoreum

>The word sounds like it should be reminiscent of leather chairs in private clubs, in libraries full of old books. The hint of brandy on the air, and the smell of a good cheroot on the horizon. Alas...

It's actually from the southern end of a northbound beaver.

Much like the civet, if you poke around in the bum-glands of enough rodents, apparently you eventually figure out which rodents smell nicer than others. In terms of the flat-tailed dam-building oversized water rats, it's apparently very nice indeed.

Again, with the cat, your average beaver will smear its bits over things to mark its territory. The 'exudate' lets other beavers know that ""Barry the Beaver"" lives here, and if you come to visit, you'd better bring one of the more pleasant brandies to share... or you'll get a wallop from the waffle-tail, and a damn good thrashing.

The beavers aren't farmed though. If you want beaver castoreum, you'd typically have to extract the glands from an ex-beaver... but more disgustingly, you then let it rot for a couple of years so that the smell goes from putrid poo to leathery musk.

The former stench - now downgraded to a mere 'aroma' - is described by the stinkologists as ""rich, leathery, and animalic""... though honestly, I'm not really seeing what's in it for the beaver at this point... and I'm left wondering just how people found this out.

If you want to freak out just a little bit more - this stuff is also sometimes used as a food additive.

# That's not all

These aren't the only three somewhat dubious additives to perfume. There are plenty more, but these three are the big deal in a bunch of 'traditional' (ie: not purely synthetic) perfumes. Brands you'd recognise, even.

>Just bear in mind that the pleasant aroma wafting across the hall from the handsome lad in the sharp summer clothes might actually be because he's squirted whale barf all over himself.",1,1738834357.0,VillainyGroup,0,1.0,False

Pulled down the sleeve and just stared a little more …. I asked is everything okay ? Didn’t say much except that I can keep the cup of the quad shot and then drove away. Didn’t ask for a refund or anything just gave me back the drink and drove. Finally took off the sleeve to read the message and I giggled. Welp thank you sir for letting all these baristas know that you maybe have a tiny wiener.

1iiyj15,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_RL_Shine/comments/1iiyj15/i_like_stepping_on_bugs_and_ive_done_much_worse/,"I like stepping on bugs, and I've done much worse ~ ! Tee hee -_^","I found this in my saved posts, so much to clean up and organize of late, but yeah, my number one favorite thing other than walking around barefoot in the spring and summer outside in town and forests is to step on bugs and kill them - more than books, coffee, flowers, night, gaming, my number one favorite thing is stepping on bugs.

I've made it into a hobby by practicing chasing them with my bare feet (which yes, I do step on them with, but usually have shoes on and kill them with shoes on too) with mixing dance with acrobatics with martial arts all into one thing I'm just calling Rebeccan Stomp for now, ballet with parkour with capoeira all in one, and I'll chase bugs around, especially like roaches at night in parks under picnic duck outs, kill hundreds a night, perfect target practice since they move and change direction so fast - I will do backflips and cartwheels to land my feet on them.

I also like killing and torturing them other ways, though - I do take a shit on them when I find them in the bathroom, or a piss, but if I'm living alone I'll not flush but just close the seat and lid and let them stew in there and suffer, which actually does hurt them, burns them through seeping into their body through the exoskeleton like being on fire but also preserves them and keeps them alive longer, which makes it more mean and so it's more fun and funny, and will flush when he's dead or it's full and just keep reusing it until then without flushing.

If you're a mom and have boys that you wanna take hunting the SLF in the northeast US in spring and summer between stomping them, you can collect them in a bottle and then on the trip back have your sons pee into the bottle of them alive as a piss bottle - or you can have your daughters do that if there aren't sons and use a FUD or the boys just close their eyes if you have both - girl's don't have to close for boys, they can watch if they want.  
  
Also if your girls express and interest in stepping on or killing bugs in creative ways, then I'd encourage you let them and give them space and attention for it - but if they don't then don't force them to, but especially if you are the mother, if you or your daughters don't wanna or don't want to in any particular moment, then I'd encourage you to force your son or sons to step on them, especially if they don't want to or are super shy or even afraid, it will break that for them, and besides you'll enjoy watching him step on them for you, but I wouldn't give boys a choice, and you or your daughter can record it for the memory or direct him to step on them as you both have him tackle them - that's how it was in my family.

I'd just let them know this is only for bugs, and not all of them, and which ones are friends - other than that girls can do it too, but it's not like a progressive thing to force, that's bad.

I'll also use them as lotion for the more juicy and less crunchy ones, whenever I need foot lotion they're actually super rich nutrients for the skin on your feet which is very different from the rest of your body, and if I'm feeling horny I can use them collected and fed and aired in a jar as lube and crush them alive as lotion for my dick and balls, super smooth and fun and funny to do for me.

I'm also a good shot, I can piss on bugs mid-air or on a wall or wherever that are like the distance of across a street if I do it right, including high up too - and so naturally when I masturbate I can control the shot and have target practiced enough with flies mid-air where I can take 'em out mid-flight with my cum, super cool and then he's just stuck on the ground or floor with goo, and I tend to let him suffer but if I'm in the mood I'll just step on him and move on.

The other thing I'll do is catch them and put them in a big two liter bottle and pour a little oil in there, shake it up around, put holes for small breathing in the bottom and a mesh down there and put the bottom back on and the sides not enough to get out and a little bit of food and water, then when there's enough bugs in there, when I gotta fart what I'll do is unscrew the lid and take out the bottom so the mesh is the only thing that's left and I'll take a small tube with a hole in the side and record this on video, put one end into my ass and the other into the top of the bottle having it sideways, and then put a lighter in the gap on the side, light it and fart as hard as I can and watch like 30 different living bugs get lit on fire with a huge fireball blowing out the bottom into the air bigger than spray deodorant and that, and the bugs scamper around and burn up in the bottle over five minutes of a calmer fire, and just laugh the whole time watching them die.

And you can also just lay down wedge them between your butt-cheeks and when you gotta fart light a lighter and the flame will actually go back as well as the normal front and flamethrower him out rather than a normal flame burst and it sounds like a paper being crumbled up with a squeal (which is him in pain) and super cool.

Let's see, haha, there's a few other things, and they don't come to mind right now but I'm sure I can just edit them in later if I feel like it. I love all things with fur, feathers, scales, or amphibians, but some crustaceans and all but a few bugs - spiders, ladybugs, butterflies all get passes - are toys for me.

I like being mean to bugs \~ !

1iiyczt,https://www.reddit.com/r/bupropion/comments/1iiyczt/bupropion_150mg_xl_overstimulated_response/,Bupropion 150mg XL - Overstimulated Response,"I have a few questions. 

First, I have an appointment with my doctor in two weeks, so I can figure this out then. I'm just looking for a little assurance and advice in the meantime.  
  
Second, a little background information:  
  
I used to take Bupropion 150mg SR twice daily. I also took an SSRI for depression. I never noticed much difference with or without the Bupropion. The SSRI seemed to do most of the work in treating my depression. I stopped antidepressants after addressing me sleep apnea and doing many hours (and many types) of therapy.

While I've had an extreme reduction in depression symptoms, I've decided to try antidepressants again while I wait for a psychiatrist to assess me for ADHD.  
  
I talked to my general practitioner about it today and they prescribed Bupropion 150mg XL once daily.

I took it today and I'm feeling a little overstimulated. I feel tightness in my jaw. I've never taken a stimulant stronger than coffee before (except the one time I tried cocaine and I didn't like it). This is how I imagine a stimulant drug response would feel: restless, jittery, muscle tension in the cheek/jaw.

My first batch of questions is about mixing bupropion with coffee.  
  
I took my bupropion with coffee. Is that enough to make a strong difference? Would taking it an hour before I have my coffee make a difference? Would it be better to take coffee out of my diet altogether? I love my coffee, so that'll be a difficult choice to make.

My next question is about the bupropion itself. Is this reaction to Bupropion XL one that'll taper off after a period of regular prescribed use? Would it be better to switch from XL to SR?

Finally, my next question is about bupropion an ADHD.

Is this response to bupropion an indication that I do **not** have ADHD? I know they prescribe NRIs (like atomoxetine) for ADHD. I also know they prescribe stimulants for ADHD. From what I understand, if a person has ADHD, they ought to have a calm and focused feeling (not a stimulated feeling) from pharmaceutical treatment.

Again, is my overstimulated response to Wellbutrin XL a sign that I do **not** have ADHD?

And, also, again: I'm talking to my doctor very soon. Ultimately, whatever change I make in my medication will be informed by what my doctor tells me. I'm just looking to find some assurance and peace of mind in the meanwhile.",1,1738832589.0,bupropion,0,1.0,False

???:“So to summarize what has just transpired… there was a prophecy, yeah?” 



As the filter of her cigarette touched her lips, she clicked her tongue aggressively. One hand leaning on the edge of what seemed like an old wall.



A wall which probably had its own story, long long back. Perhaps it was a castle, or a house… Well now, it was barely tall enough to come up to her kneecaps. Overgrown with blue shrubbery, the likes of which she had never seen before. She perched on the small wall with urgency, her lithe frame and movements betraying a sense of aggression.  



Lily took a long drag of her cigarette, and closed her eyes. Her hair was a sight to behold, unlike anything the people of that time had ever seen. On the right side of her temple, she sported an undershave, while on the top, her beautiful black locks were carefully combed to the left and back of her head. A small section of her hair was even dyed green at the tips, and held together with a scrunchie. Despite her unique look, the people around her were quick to judge, seeing her as strange and unworthy of a woman. Some even feared she might be the second coming of the demon king.… But we’re getting a bit ahead of ourselves on that one



When she opened her eyes, all they could see was rage. But even in that rage, Lily’s eyes were beautiful. Her sharp and penetrating eyes bore into you, piercing through your soul. Her nose wrinkled up as she scowled at the man right in front of her. She tossed the cigarette aside before pulling out another immediately after that one ended. She lit up the stick of paper, causing confusion among her peers who couldn't fathom what it was that she had put in her mouth, and was now emitting smoke.



Lily When the stars align, the Hero will emerge and he will rid the world of darkness….Lumin.



??: Yes, you see, the oracle has prophesied about a hero from another world who will eliminate the evils of our realm.



Lily: Oracles…right 



she scoffed

Lily: let's say for a second, for a single fucking second, that i believe you. And that all this oracle business isn't some hogwash…

Lily: Hypothetically, even if I do believe this prophecy bullshit. The prophecy says LUMIN will save the world. LUMIN. MY NAME IS LILY!



She said to the old man standing in front of her.  His eyes emitted an unsettling aura that suggested he had experienced a great deal of bloodshed. It was difficult to discern if he viewed people as expendable or not, but Lily's instincts recoiled at his presence. He wore a velvety red overcoat, embroidered with jewels and military tags, not as a means of establishing his status, but rather to display his power. Beneath the coat, he donned a thin armor that appeared to have scales, at least that's what Lily presumed.

His silver hair fluttered in the wind, and his upright posture conveyed not only power, but also authority. The deep scar across his eyes might give the impression of blindness, but it would be foolish to underestimate his strength. His weathered pale ash brown skin hinted at his life of constant fighting. He was a dangerous man, surrounded by six others clad in armor from head to toe and armed with an array of weapons ranging from swords to maces. His countenance was that of a strong, capable ruler, someone who could accomplish anything. He was Cedric Aurelius, the emperor of Arkonia, but let's not get side tracked again.



Lily took a deep breath, then screamed at the top of her lungs.



Lily: DO I LOOK LIKE A “LUMIN” TO YOU ASSHOLES?!



Cedric: well yes…I can see we made a mistake young la-



Before he could finish his sentence, Lily went on the offensive once again.



Lily: No! you listen to me mister, first you randomly bring me to this weird fucking world out of nowhere…WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE OR CONSENT,  MIND YOU! Who do you fucking think you are?!



???:Impudent little worm, how dare you speak like that to his highness? I shall behead you right now!



 As one of the knights made a sudden move to draw his sword, Cedric fixed him with a steely gaze that made the man tremble in his armor. The sound of clanking metal echoed through the air as the knight dropped his sword and fell to his knees. Cedric's eyes blazed with anger and his formidable presence instilled a deep sense of fear in Lily. One of the other knights laid a hand on the trembling man's shoulder, urging him to regain his composure.



???: Perhaps we should make this conversation a bit more private, your highness.



The man, dressed in what appeared to be a tattered robe with a furry collar and sleeves, spoke in a raspy voice. A hood dropping from the neck of his robe, with the collar and sleeves having thick fur weaved into it. Arkonia was a warm country. and yet this man was dressed in clothes that make others sweat just by looking. And then there was his appearance, he had his hair slicked back, and a monocle for his right eye, his moustache twirled up. And for SOME reason, he was holding his temple and seemed to be in agonizing pain, with his eyes blood red and tears welling up in his eyes.



Lily hated his guts. The moment he spoke,  there was a fire in Lily's eyes and she wanted to gauge his eyes out…after all he was the kingdom's archmage who had summoned her to this world, Linus.

A few hours ago…

  
  


Lily: I still can't believe you're going away to work with penncorp…I mean who's gonna help me fix my code whenever I get too close to it to see my mistakes?



??: Hey man, I'll drop by from time to time to work on our stuff too! this is our little madhouse Lil…we will change the world.



The young man said, standing before her was like a vision, his turtleneck strained over his muscular frame, every inch of him covered in a fine layer of dust and grease from working tirelessly in the workshop. His jet-black hair framed a chiseled jawline, while his crimson eyes glinted with a hint of mischief. There was a magnetic pull to him, a dangerous allure that no one could resist - especially not Lily, who found herself drawn to him in ways she couldn't explain. In short, Lumin was a force to be reckoned with, and he knew it.



Lily: Yeah right! you're just salty because even after over a year of working with me, we couldn’t get most of our inventions to work like they were meant to. Honestly I'd be lying if I said I wasn't pissed about that too.



She pouted while pulling herself out from under what seemed to be a huge chunk of machinery to the untrained eye. But these were projects Lumin and Lily had worked for months on! State of the art computers wouldn't be able to come close to their babies. Or at least that's what they hoped for, but turns out a lack of resources coupled with their desire to contantly push for the impossible had led to many situations where the two bit off more than they can chew. Lily took off one of her gloves to rub the grease on her face, only to make it worse.



Lumin: Hey it’s not my fault you didn’t get the code right! I keep telling you, the hardware is not the problem.



lily: Oh boo hoo! we both got it wrong man, come on…



Lumin sighed thinking to himself that he couldn’t win an argument with her. He raised his hands in surrender, he was about to say something but then he heard their coffee machine stop. Grabbing two cups he walked towards her.



lumin: yeah yeah, here’s your coffee. 



He gave her a hand to help her get up, the short lass quickly bounced up and grabbed his hand that held the mug. She pulled away from him and while taking a sip of her coffee she said



Lily: You know, bringing me coffee is good and all but when are you going to ask me out



Lumin: Hmm..lets see…I'll take you out on a date when we fix all our failed projects.



lily: Oh shit really? I was just pulling yo-



She paused a second to see Lumin holding back his laugh, with a pout on her face and her hand on her hip she said



Lily: Oh you're a mean bastard you know!



Lumin: Hey, I never said no!



Lily: Yeah yeah, fuck you Lumin.



Lumin: Ah no, no I'm good



Lily: That’s not…anyway…



She sighed, putting down her mug and wiped her forehead with her arm. She pulled out a small notebook from her pocket to see what was next on her agenda. She skimmed through her schedule and nodded in exasperation and opened up a panel on one of the machines next to her.



Lumin: oh come on! I just told you it’s gotta be the code, not the hardware! THE CODE!



Lumin sounding quite irritated, and yet he keeps himself cool enough for the listener to think that he’s just being playfully antagonistic.



Lily: Yeah yeah, I know it’s not the problem man, I just need to check something real quick 



She says while focusing solely on the machine and not Lumin’s overconfident rambling. Despite his undeniable attractiveness, Lumin's tendency to shirk responsibility and avoid admitting his mistakes often got on Lily's nerves.. It was always someone else’s fault.

Then again, he was a pretty smart guy, so having him around in her workshop saved her time from looking for new graduates who would work for as low of a pay check as he did.



Lily: Hey, real quick, can you toss me the flathead?



She says while poking her head back out of the contraption she was working on.



Lumin, without thinking too much, grabs a flathead hammer. He was too occupied with the thought of her second guessing his work, to pay attention to her words.



Lumin: Here, catch!



He said, lost in thought.



Lily: Wait!  Don’t toss that thing! No, I meant the screw dri-



Before she can finish though, Lumin has already flung the hammer in her direction. Lily gets caught off guard and the hammer bashes her head and knocks her ou- Huh…what's happening to her? Her unconscious body started glowing, steam erupting from her pores. 



Lumin: L-Lily?



He says as he finally looks at her, and he rushes towards her but before he could, poof! she's gone, vamos motherfucker! where Lily’s body lay, now there’s nothing but dust. it’s as if her body just vanished out of thin air



Lumin: LILY!



He screams, but in vain, for it is too late, Lily was summoned to another world.

  


ᐊᐓᐊᐓᐊᐓᐊᐓᐊᐓᐊᐓᐊᐓᐊᐓᐊᐓᐊᐓᐊᐓᐊᐓᐊᐓᐊᐓᐊᐓᐊᐓᐊᐓᐊᐓᐊᐓᐊᐓᐊᐓᐊᐓᐊᐓᐊᐓᐊᐓ

  


Her ears were ringing, her vision blacked out. She wasn’t able to tell what was happening, all she could hear was two people arguing, but about what? Her disoriented senses couldn’t join the dots.??: \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

A voice just barely loud enough to be heard caught her attention…just what in the world was happening around her, why couldn’t she move? Why couldn’t she see or hear anything? Cold sweat started dripping from her forehead, her heartbeats started getting faster and faster. And yet the numbing sensation throughout her body wouldn't go away. ??: \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*



For a soul as curious as Lily, it was not the fear of the unknown that was itching at Lily’s mind. It was the fact that she couldn’t comprehend what was happening. There were no explanations she could think of. All she remembered was, Lumin threw a hammer at her, and the next thing she knew is ….nothing! She doesn’t know why she can't see, or hear. She doesn’t know why she can't feel the sensation of touch or smell the surrounding, or why she could only hear things in small indiscernible mumblings that held no meaning.  
  
???:  \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*   
  
She didn’t understand what she just heard. To be more precise it would be more accurate to say that all she understood is that the voice said something, she couldn’t grasp the words, or rather she heard it, she grasped it, but a word she didn’t understand may as well have been a toddlers cries for her. Something indecipherable. And then she heard a loud ringing noise, it was as if someone had just blown an air horn in her ears, pain and nausea took all over her body. The feeling of her heart beating suddenly stopped. She tried moving her hands, but no luck. It was like having her brain trapped in a body that had no function. She was feeling trapped in her own body. Her breathing started slowing down until it came to a still. She wasn’t suffocating, but she felt like she was drowning. Her body wasn't hurt anywhere, but the pain she felt in those moments could only be compared to someone trying to rip her bones out of her flesh while her muscles were being torn apart, she could feel a tug at her bones tearing her apart from the inside limb from limb, every nerve, every artery completely shredded. She couldn’t hear, but the noise was blaring so loud, it could pop her eardrums. She couldn't see, her eyelids were closed. Pitch black darkness covered her vision but to her it felt like someone had held a magnifying glass and focused sunlight in her eyes on the hottest of summer days. She tried screaming for help, but her mouth wouldn't respond. She tried to move, but her body wouldn't allow it. Her brain felt like a thousand needles piercing her head from every follicle in her head, piercing all the way through her skull right into the brain. All she wanted to do was throw up, to beg for help and yet she couldn't.



And then it stopped. There was no more noise. No more sounds. The pain left her body as if it never existed. Her breathing returned to normal. Her heart was now beating as if she had just woken up from a good comfortable nap. She could feel something along the back of her arms. The feeling of laying in wet grass, the smell of rain that had perhaps come to pass not too long ago was so aromatic it would make one forget about all worries and just relax in the beautiful weather. The cold wind blowing against her skin felt as pleasant as sitting in a cool air conditioned room on a hot summer day. And then she opened her eyes.



??: See sire? Nothing to worry about, she’s okay! Girl, D.O  Y.O.U.  U.N.D.E.R.S.T.A.N.D   W.H.A.T   I   A.M  S.A.Y.I.N.G?



The man said as he was on all fours, over the girl who was unconscious until now…well at least she hoped that the previous experience was a dream, and this too..at least then she had some hope to wake up and go back to telling Lumin about this wild dream she had. Because the other reality was that all that she felt right now was real, and that she would have to deal with it.Her slender frame lay on the ground with her back cushioned by soft blue grass, the kind she had never seen before, and it seemed to have a certain pleasant aroma, one she had never before felt.

As her eyes locked with the man who was on top of her, seemingly checking her pulse to see if she's alive, she got agitated and confused. His robes made of a dirty rag smelled like they had been washed in sewer water and dried out in the local dumpster. His weirdly curled mustache and his monocle made him look like a villain out of a cartoon. As her senses caught up to her, she sensed some form of danger from the man and instinctually, she swung her hand to attack him. Not noticing that she still held the hammer that Lumin had passed to her, she swung the hammer at full force, hitting the man right across his temple with the sharp end of the flathead hammer lodged right in his skull.

??:GAAAHHH!! WHAT THE-

He screamed in agony as his head kept bleeding, he jumped back up and stumbled back and fell behind. The blood gushing out of his head was no joke, if this were the normal world, this would require immediate hospitalization and a trip to the ICU and even then your chances of survival would be low. But Linus was a mage among mages. He may have been a little neurotic and slightly insane, but if there was one thing you could trust the man on, is his impeccable skill as a mage. He quickly screamed.



Linus: Al..Altus… MEDICINA! RESUMERE INITIO!



As he yelled those words, the blood that had spilled everywhere, from the ground, from Lily’s jeans, from his own hands, all of it started to flow back into his head, followed by the hammer falling on the ground and his skull started filling up the hole it had with the broken shards of his bone, and the cracks started sealing up as if they never existed. Followed by his pierced skin that started molding itself like clay and going back to a pristine condition as if he was never hurt.



Lily saw it all happen in front of her. She was intrigued, for sure. But her survival instincts won over her curiosity as fear started flooding her mind. She couldn’t comprehend what she had just seen. No. No. Something like this just isn’t plausible! What just happened? A temporal reversal? Perhaps an illusionary hologram that is able to react to its surroundings? No that wasn’t it. She very clearly felt the blood on her jeans when it spilled on her. So what was i- NO! HOW?! How? was the real question! How did something like that even happen? How? How? How? She could feel the hair on her arms standing sharp, her teeth trembling, and her fingers shaking. She instinctively started biting her fingers out of fear.

She kept chewing over and over until she broke the skin, but she didn't even notice it…Just a little bit of blood from her fingers was not going to be enough to overcome what she was feeling at that moment. So she continued to bite, over and over and over and over, and she didn’t stop. Not until she started biting right through the bone. Pain? What pain? The fear that seeped through her mind was sharp enough that it completely negated the pain that she felt! She could see the white of her bone and she knew she was gonna lose her finger, but she couldn’t stop herself. What she had just seen. It was too insane of a concept for her mind to comprehend at first.



???: For god sake Linus! I told you not to do that for now! We were going to explain to her the situation slowly.



Linus: SHE CRACKED MY BLOODY SKULL OPEN, WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO?! Don't worry dammit! I can fix this



??:Well then do something! 



Said the rather large man sitting on a seat? Throne? She couldn't quite tell what it was, but she could tell that the man sitting on it commanded the most power here. The seat was held up by four men, clad in what looked like armor fully made of metal from top to bottom, and two more guards stood at the front and back of the seat, acting as the man’s protective forces. She didn’t know what was happening, but she knew he was the one incharge in that room. The Emperor of Arkonia Cedric Aurelius.

I..I don’t wanna die. I DON’T WANNA DIE! She thought to herself. But before she could say a word Linus cast another spell while still holding his head even though at first glance there was no injury.Linus: Cor Maximum Corroborare! Altus Medicina! Resumere Initio! Traducere!



He said while waving a hand towards Lily and he continued



Linus: May the blood of the dragon serve you well! For thee shall have the courage to deal with it all!



And as he said that, a golden light started emitting out of Lily, and as the light dimmed, Lily started to calm down. No, not just calm down. She herself was shocked as to how she went from an extreme emotion of fear, to absolute mental serenity in a single moment. But that wasn’t all, her flesh and blood started seeping back into her fingers. The bone was no longer visible, Her face regained its color and her eyes started getting a certain sense of confidence back in them. She still couldn’t understand a word of what they said, but she was starting to grasp a word or two here or there, and then it evolved into her being able to fully comprehend everything that they were saying. She was able to deduce that they weren’t there to hurt her by their behavior.

Cor Maximum Corroborare was a spell that strengthened the will of the target to not feel fear or pressure. It was one of the strongest spiritual spells a mage could use and cost quite a pretty penny. Thanks to Linus using this spell, Lily had calmed down and was able to think for a second. Traducere was a spell that helped the subject understand any language when in range of the user, quite a useless spell for most people, but Linus had picked it up because he thought it may prove to be helpful some day.

Cedric: Put me down.

The Emperor of Arkonia said, in a commanding manner to his entourage. He walked towards Lily, and he got on a knee bending in front of the young girl. YOUR MAJESTY! Yelled one of his armored knights! But Cedric just raised his hand, as if commanding the man to pipe down and let him do what he wants. The young knight wasn’t happy about this, but was understanding that it was his king’s will.



Cedric, held out his hand to Lily and said. Cedric: I am truly sorry for all of that ugliness girl. I wish that we had more consideration for that.



Lily kept silent, not extending her hand out. Just standing there making eye contact with the emperor who had bowed down to her.



Cedric: Do-does she not understand what i said? Hey Linus, cast the spell agai-

Lily: I do not forgive you. 

She said with the coldest stare imaginable. There was a quiet rage in her eyes, Cor maximum corroborare had helped her cool down, but that wasn’t a justification for all she had gone through until now. After all, why should she have to deal with all these unpleasantries and for what?

Cedric: pardon me miss, but I am apologizing for our actions. I am the emper-



Lily: I DONT CARE WHO YOU FUCKING ARE! 



She said while gritting her teeth and clenching her fists. Much to the displeasure of one of the knights who wanted to execute this woman for her disrespect of his king. But the king was a benevolent man. He understood what she had gone through, after all a long time ago, he had gone through it too…. For now though, he wanted her to understand that she’s safe. And that no one would hurt her.

Cedric, took off his crown, placed it on the ground, as a sign that he understood that she was upset. He just wanted to talk. His eyes held no light but they were filled with hope. As she looked him in the eyes she felt something she couldn’t describe. His sincerity finally reached Lily, who took a deep breath and said



Lily: The king of a country should not bow in front of strangers you know.



She said as she sat down crossing her legs in front of Cedric. Cedric was startled, she called him a king? Did she know of this world? Perhaps she was ...no that wasn’t it.



Cedric: You… know who I am?



He asked cautiously.



Lily: No. I’m just not a total dipshit. You’re wearing a literal crown.  Of course you're a king or some kind of royalty at the least.



Cedric: Ahh..I..I see…



Lily: So “Your highness”..



She said smugly while leaning back a bit supporting herself with her arms. But as she did, she squealed in pain. The wound was gone, but she could still feel every inch of the pain of chewing her own fingers, so she perked back up. Agitated by the pain she clicked her tongue. She sat right up straight, pulled out a cigarette out of her pocket with her uninjured left hand and lit it up.



Lily:  Go ahead. Explain.



Her composure was honestly rather chilling even for Cedric. He knew this was thanks to the efforts of one mage who was currently laying on the ground holding his head. He sighed as he put his hands on his knees, and he said.



Cedric: I need you to stay calm, and listen to what I’m about to say.



Lily took a big drag of her smoke, while the emperor’s entourage seemed quite confused as to what the contraption in her hands was. The emperor didn’t seem bothered by it though. He ignored the putrid smell that ruined the pleasant atmosphere of their surroundings and started speaking.



Cedric: This is going to be a little shocking, but this is not your world.



Lily: Yeah, the blue grass was kind of a giveaway.



Her rude response was not something Cedric didn’t expect. After all at the moment, Lily wouldn’t even let a dragon get under her nerves. The spell Linus used had steeled her heart to the point that nothing could make her feel anxious.



Cedric: Right…umm… I am the emperor of the Arkonian Empire. Cedric Aurelius.



Lily: Yeah, good for you. Let's skip the small talk. WHY AM I HERE?!



She was slightly annoyed by the slow pacing of Cedric’s story. What’s that? Is my pacing also slow? Well screw you. It's my story, I do what I want. Right....umm... Back to Cedric then.



Cedric, slightly annoyed now, took a minute to contemplate how to explain her situation to her in the nicest way possible, and then he said.



Cedric: You were summoned to this world with magic. I understand it isn’t a concept in your world.



Lily: Magic? Ha! That’s not real!



Cedric: Really? After all you’ve seen just in the last ten minutes you still say that?



Cedric chuckled a bit while Lily made a sour face.



Lily: I didn't mean that it’s not real in the sense that it doesn’t exist. I just believe magic is just science that YOU don’t understand yet.



Cedric: Well, perhaps you may be right.



Cedric said while smiling while one of the guards said to the other



??: hey..psst.. The hell is a saye-ense?



Cedric continued



Cedric: The truth is these lands hold a prophecy.



Lily: great, first magic now prophecies. What’s next, a unicorn?

Cedric: I know you jest, but those are all real in this world, child. Though the “unicorns” that you may know of are quite different from the ones that you will find.

Cedric chuckled.

Lily: Oh…. Please continue.



She sighed with exasperation. 



Cedric: The prophecy states that on the day when the stars align to form the summoning sign, the hero will appear, who saves the world from darkness.



Lily: And you think I’m the hero?



She chuckled a bit while taking another puff out of her cigarette.



Cedric: We planned to not fulfill the prophecy! We…we thought summoning to be dangerous…but that fool Linus thought it imperative to call forth the hero…but now that you’re here..



Lily: hm?She raised an eyebrow, half expecting him to say she has to help them or something, but the king bowed in front of her, touching his head to the ground. His guards enraged, wanting their emperor to raise his head and command this worthless lowlife woman to do as he says. But his majesty continued…



Cedric: I know, you owe this world nothing. That we dragged you out of a life you were living, just for our selfish needs. But please…save our world! Save our world, oh great hero…LUMIN!



Lily dropped her cigarette, with a ticked off expression, her left eye twitching… She paused for a second as it took her a minute to process what was just said and then she took a deep breath and-



Lily: HUUUUUUHHHHHHH???? DI-DID YOU JUST CALL ME LUUUMIIINNNNNNN?????..



Cedric: Y-Yes, I apologize, do you have a different preferred name?  
  


She clenched her fist with the broken fingers ignoring the pain. She closed her eyes, punched the ground and yelled.Lily: Y-YOU….FU-She took a deep breath.Lily: I AM NOT LUMIN YOU DUMBFUCKS! **YOU GOT THE WRONG GAL!!**

1iiy0bx,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassroomOfTheElite/comments/1iiy0bx/so_i_have_a_problem_with_kiriyama/,So I have a problem with Kiriyama,"https://preview.redd.it/gmk8ty5hdhhe1.jpg?width=225&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bd134b130a747ac9c9eacd6e8fa3b146eb59cadb

Kiriyamid is the worst thing to ever happen to COTE.

I mean that with my whole chest. He is a complete waste of panel space, dialogue, word count, space, time, effort and existence. If a character was ever designed to be *aggressively* mid, it’s this fraud. His entire personality is just being Nagumo’s lapdog while pretending to look like he has any meaningful value beyond wasting our energy on him. Bro's introduction was so underwhelming you could literally remove him from the scene and it would still work. Just like his bum master Manabuse who's carried by narrative and Kiyo's glaze, the failed experiment known as Kiriyama takes this a step further by preserving all of Manabu's failures that he passed down to him, except this time, he's a literal failure of a person in every single way. Imagine being hyped as the second-in-command of the most influential body in the school and the person who Manabu himself trusts so much he reveals you to Kiyo only to spend the entirety of your screentime getting clowned by your own boss and every reader lamenting the waste of word count spent on you.

Kiriyama has exactly one (1) defining trait: being Nagumo’s personal chew toy. His only real strategy in the entire series was figuring out how to stay *exactly* one step **behind** Nagumo at all times without tripping over the shattered remains of his spine. The moment Nagumo folded him out of Class A, this dude lost his soul and became a walking L simulator. Imagine getting demoted *and* humiliated *and* still choosing to serve the guy who did it to you. Kiriyama didn’t just drink the Nagumo Kool-Aid; oh no... he set up the entire refreshments table and started refilling other people’s cups in service of his master that he pretends to hate. Imagine Nagumo thinks so lowly of you that he keeps you as his personal ~~plaything~~  Student Council Vice President just to insult you to your face and you still bark for him.

And the worst part? He actually *thinks* he’s **him**. He actually believed he was some kind of shadow mastermind waiting to overthrow Nagumo. The reality check hit him harder than being demoted to Class B. Actually scrap that... it hit him harder than the time he tried to manhunt Koenji with 18 other 3rd years and still failed miserably. Dude, bro, buddy... if Nagumo keeps you around just to *openly* insult you in public while you stand there and take it, you’re not his secret rival; you’re his pet. He only let Kiriyama breathe in the Student Council because it amused him to see his former “opponent” reduced to a glorified errand boy. And Kiriyama, in all his fraudulent glory, accepted that role without hesitation.

People like to talk about how Kiryuin rejected Nagumo’s system. You know who *didn’t*? Kiriyama. Not because he agreed with it, but because he literally couldn’t do anything about it. He had no class, no plan, no shame, no pride, no spine. Just misplaced entitlement and an ego running on fumes. Seriously guys... Let this sink in: Manabu actually entrusted his legacy to this bum 😭😭😭, Bro folded quicker than Ichinose's next breakdown smh. Goes to show that bums really do attract one another.

Imagine being such a fraudulent ass of a character that your best achievement is victimizing Kiryuin, *the worst-written character in COTE history*. That’s like dunking on a traffic cone and getting an MVP for it. Even half-baked Utomiya has more substance than Kiriyama. In fact, I’ll go a step further: Even the new 1st year NPCs with like 1 illustration from the upcoming Y3V1 have more soul than Kiriyama. At least Kiryuin gave us some laughs ya know? Even the 1st year NPCs serve a purpose in creating buzz and hype for the new volume. What is Kiriyama's purpose exactly? What does he contribute? Absolutely nothing except wasted word count. Unironically, every volume he appeared in sucked, and I fully believe his presence was a major reason why.

Like OMG... This dude... every time I think of it... Kiriyama’s entire COTE tenure was just a highlight reel of self-inflicted Ls. In his very first appearance, dude had the audacity to express **“serious doubts”** about Ayanokoji’s abilities. Imagine walking onto the COTE stage for the very first time and the first thing you do is shit on the overpowered Isekai protagonist. Bro committed a *cardinal sin* the moment he popped up on screen. That alone should’ve been grounds for immediate expulsion. Talk about self-righteous entitlement. How do you doubt the guy who has been outplaying *everyone* in the series while you’re busy running Nagumo’s coffee orders? That’s like a D-tier NPC questioning the protagonist’s power level while their own plot relevance is hanging by a thread. Smh... People say he doesn't glaze Kiyo, but that's only because he's already busy being Nagumo's number 1 bootlicker. He licked them boots clean like his life depended on it. And it kinda did, because the moment Nagumo tosses him aside, he'd have *nothing*. No class, no respect, no legacy, just a participation trophy for ""Longest-Serving Background Character With an Attitude."" Bro milked him so hard just for a petty ticket to Class A. That's just the icing on the cake of shamelessness isn't it? Imagine your class leader just abandons ship on you like that, when all of you are in this mess because of his inability to lead in the first place. But sure, let's give him the *hE dIdnT gLAzE kIYo* trophy. Can't ride meat when you're already riding meat am I right? 🤷‍♂️

But it gets worse. This fraud actually thought he was some kind of leader. As I mentioned before, he led *18 third years*—**EIGHTEEN**—to take down *one* second-year student. And guess what? He failed. Miserably. Spectacularly. That’s his leadership in action folks. Imagine outnumbering someone 18-to-1 and still ending up in the dirt. If there was ever a moment that summed up his fraudulent existence, that was it. No wonder Nagumo rose to Class A so easily and was so bored of special exams he created a meritocratic gauntlet tournament for his amusement.

And when you thought it couldn't get any worse... when you thought there just might be hope for some redemption, maybe a *single* act that justifies his sad life, he decides to rob us of *Kiyo vs. Nagumo.* So a cardinal sin in his introduction and another in his conclusion; hats off to the consistency. A plan so convoluted you'd swear it came straight out of left field. And by targeting KIRYUIN. Of all people. Kiriyama looked at the most hype potential confrontation of Year 2 and really said, *“Nah, let me fumble this plot real quick.""* As if there weren't already enough reasons to hate him. Honestly at this point, it almost feels like his incompetence is deliberate. Every time he shows up, he actively makes the story worse. First, by existing. Second, by failing at literally *everything* he attempts. Third, by ensuring that any potentially good moment is derailed by his *unmatched* ability to take an L.

Hands down the best thing to ever happen in COTE is Kiriyama’s graduation. His character arc wasn’t even a downfall because he was never *up* to begin with; not that he had an arc; not that he deserved an arc. He was a filler NPC with no real weight, no impact, and no purpose beyond playing Nagumo’s personal punching bag. And for all that loyalty, all that dedication, all that barking at Nagumo’s command, he still left the school as an irrelevant afterthought. Bro was so irrelevant he didn't even get a proper conclusion. Even Kinu knew how much of a waste of space he is that he didn't even bother writing him into Y2V11.

The series itself breathed a sigh of relief when he left. I can confidently say now that Y3 will be a much better work due to his departure. Kiriyamid was never him. Kiriyama was **never even close** to being him. And when the time came for him to prove his worth ever so slightly, whatever worth he had, all he did was remind us why he never had any in the first place. This post is more than he ever deserved.

I have greens, whites, oolongs, blacks, and plenty of herbals) as well as my pour-over coffee (sorry tea, I just need more caffeine. It's not you, it's me!)

So, my main goals are 1) gooseneck design, 2) temperature presets.

The temperature presets for different tea types is important becasue ~~I'm lazy~~ I have ADHD, and I have accepted that I am never going to memorize the different ideal temps for teas and coffee, and I will never be patient enough to stand there setting the temperature in +/- 1° increments, like many ""variable temperature"" electric kettles make you do. And I'm definitely not patient enough to babysit a stovetop kettle! The other important feature is just durability/quality. I've had multiple Cuisinart kettles break down on me, so I don't want to get some cheap-o Amazon dropshipper kettle.

The most commonly recommended gooseneck kettle is the Fellow Stagg, but it's very expensive, moreso for the Pro version that has temp presets. A basic steel Bonavita is my last resort, as I find the handle uncomfortable, but it otherwise does fulfill my requirements. (Ironically, there used to be a glass-bodied Bonavita Cosmpolitan gooseneck kettle that would have been PERFECT for me, but it's long discontinued and can't be found anywhere). I do hear positive reviews about Cosori from time to time, but it looks like a cheap-o Amazon Stagg knockoff so I have doubts about its quality, and also I've heard the preset temps are inaccurate. Willow & Everett, while better in optics, is still ultimately a cheap-o Amazon brand.

The date was better than expected, I would see him again to see where it goes! 

The thing is… his messages may be way too sporadic for my liking. I would’ve thought he lost interest but he still messages me enough to know he didn’t. But I swear, within the ~5 things he sent since the date, he messages me random things but then won’t respond for 10 hours MINIMUM to my response. It kinda feels like a cat and mouse game!! It just doesn’t feel like he he’s like looking forward to chatting AT ALL?? 

Again, I understand some people aren’t much Texters and he does sound like his schedule is busy… but I feel like it doesn’t take much time to just message? I’m absolutely not expecting 24/7 but I don’t like wondering if the next date is even going on because it’s nearly radio silent.

The pain that was shooting up my leg slowly faded as we got back to my house. I was still bleeding, but it was hard to focus on the injury. My mind and body felt disconnected; I moved my hand to slide my phone out of my bag before even realizing what I was doing. 

“What are you doing?” Emily asked me as she checked the mirrors.

“Calling Caleb.” I spit out. My hands were shaking so badly that it was hard to hold my phone. 

The call only rang twice before he answered; a wave of relief washed over me the moment I heard his voice. 

“I need you to come back to Greenridge…” I coughed. I could feel myself crying again, but I didn’t know why. The first time Caleb and I explored the school, it was not this intense, yes I was scared, but this felt different. Caleb told me that he was already on his way back. I can’t tell you how happy I was to hear that. 

\-

As we pulled into the house, I winced and reached down to grab my leg. Emily jumped out of the car and motioned for Noah to pull in behind her. “We need to get you inside,” Emily said as she helped me up, I grabbed both of the bags and watched Noah come running towards the door. 

“Kira!” I yelled, and the front door swung open. 

“What happened to you?” Hunter questioned, but I couldn’t explain right away. I felt like I was going to throw up. Caleb was going to kill me for letting random people into his house, but it felt like I didn’t have a choice. 

Emily put me on the couch; I watched her dig around in her bag and pull out a first aid kit. I could hear Noah as he moved around to make sure everything was locked. The cut on my leg looked serious; the wound had a deep purple glow to it. The moment Emily applied the medicine, another wave of pain shot through my leg and into the rest of my body; my eyes rolled back, and I passed out. 

\-

“Cassandra?” I heard Caleb's voice say as I felt my body being nudged. He pushed at me a few times before I gave in and opened my eyes. 

I quickly sat up and checked my leg; it was wrapped up, and most of the pain was gone. I turned my attention to the room; Caleb, Emily, Noah, Hunter, Kira, and Coraline were all waiting for me to get up. 

Caleb gently put Hannah’s bag on my stomach. 

“If you’re going to search it, you have to do it soon,” Noah said seriously. I watched him spin a white knife in his hand, it looked fancy and came out to a curved point. 

“Why the rush?” I asked as I slowly opened the bag and started searching every pocket. 

“We have to kill the principal to shut down the school once and for all; when that’s done, we have to get out of dodge. All of us, together.” Emily said as she moved to check my leg. 

I turned to the kids; they were quiet and watching us intensely. I could tell that they were scared and to be honest, so was I. 

“How are we supposed to do that? He shrugged off your bullets like they were nothing. Also, what about those people who we left behind?” I asked Noah before thanking Emily for helping me with my leg. 

“Using this knife. It’s hard to explain, but we are like you and Caleb. I am capable of using these objects, they’re special. Only these objects can kill one of those…monsters.” Noah explained. I was still so damn confused. 

“I told them about how I saved Kira; I told them everything that happened to us before. I also did my best to explain how you can talk to some spirits and were looking for information about your sister.” Caleb told me. 

I looked towards Emily, “What can you do?” 

“Spot these places of Paranormal Occurrence or Paranormal Phenomena, or whatever. We haven’t picked a name for buildings like the school yet. The point is, I can see them, the objects, and spot other people like us. Luke and Tiffiny weren’t like us but they wanted to come with Noah and me, anyway.” Emily mumbled.

“I’m sorry about your friends.” That is about all I could offer. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing, but in a way, it made some sense. Still, what happened to Luke and Tiffiny was awful, and going back to Greenridge with our lives hinging on a knife didn’t sound too promising. 

\-

I slid a notebook with my name on it out of Hannah’s backpack and put the bag on the floor. When we were younger, we would leave each other messages all the time. As I sat there looking at the notebook, it hit me; I don’t actually remember much about our childhood. I remember Hannah and my parents, and the school I went to; it was a private school just a few miles from here. But I couldn’t remember much else and the harder I tried to remember, the more painful it became. 

The first page read: 

“Hi Cass, I don’t know if you’ll get this or not, but I figured that it wouldn’t hurt to try. I wanted to leave you a proper note at the house, but Mom and Dad are acting weird. I think that the best place to leave this notebook is in my backpack. If you found this note, that means that you went to my school.” 

“I tried telling our parents about what had been happening, and they brushed me off. Told me to leave it alone, and grounded me for a month. Since they won’t listen, I’ll just tell you. Mom said that I was getting sick and would have to go away for a while.” 

“A few weeks ago, a girl was murdered in our auditorium. I don’t know the details, but the whole school was on edge. She is not the only one to die or go missing this year, mom and dad said these things happen sometimes. The teachers have been weird too, not all of them but…I caught the lunch lady sniffing me yesterday. The principal said that I should be flattered and that I must smell nice. I begged Mom and Dad to keep me home the next day but they said that I have to go.” 

I turned my attention to the second page. 

“A lot of my friends are gone, Cass. Not just my friends either, others are gone now too. Kira, Wayne, Hunter, Coraline, Liam, James, Chloe, Tylor, and Taylor are gone. I saw three students being taken out of school by some guys wearing hazmat suits. My headaches are getting worse, I think we are all sick or something.” 

“Mom said that they’re sending me to the ChestCreek Hospital in Mercy. I have no idea where that is but if you get this please, find me.” 

\-

I got up from the couch so fast I nearly kicked things off of the coffee table. I felt like a new wave of life had washed over me. Though I still couldn’t walk fully, I knew where we had to go and what we had to do. 

“Are we all packed?” I asked as I watched the kids put their jackets on. 

“Yes but what the hell got into you?” Caleb asked as I passed him the notebook. 

“Let’s go finish this once and for all,” I said as I limped towards the front door. As I ripped it open, I took another look up and down the street. People were leaving their homes, some people were returning home. Could they really not know what’s been going on right down the street? 

As we loaded the cars, we came up with a proper plan: the kids were going to wait in Noah's car while we finished up at the school. Once that is done, Noah and Caleb will take his car, and Emily and I will take my car and we will go try to find Hannah. Noah seemed to think we should always be on the move, but wouldn’t give us the exact details. 

\-

Arriving at Greenridge for the final time was extremely tense. As we pulled into the parking lot I scanned the outside of the school; I was hoping to see the groundskeeper. I wanted to have one last conversation. But he wasn’t outside and maybe that was for the best; Caleb did tell me that he attacked him. 

“Are you ready for this?” Emily asked me as we stepped out of my car. I could hear Noah and Caleb getting out of Noah’s car. Everything felt surreal. 

“Not really,” I admitted to Emily as the men caught up with us. 

“Remind me again why we have to shut this place down?” I asked Noah as we slowly walked towards the door. 

“If we don’t, it is going to keep luring people here and collecting bodies.” Noah sighed. Something was weighing on him, but I didn’t want to push him further. We all had to be focused on this. 

“Cassandra and I will go for the principal,” Noah said to the group as we got to the front door. I was extremely surprised that none of the killers ever came out to meet us; it actually made me wonder if they knew we were here when we pulled in. 

“Why are we splitting up again?” Caleb mumbled under his breath. 

“As soon as we walk into the building the weapon that Noah is carrying will ring the dinner bell. With all of the killers distracted that means Caleb and I have the opportunity to search the school and maybe bring a few more spirits back. Cassandra and Noah will go together because she should be able to have a direct conversation with the killers.” Emily explained as I reached for the door and slowly pulled it open. 

Putting an end to this, finding my sister, and maybe giving a few more people a second chance…all of these thoughts were fueling me. But I would be lying if I said that I wasn’t terrified. 

As soon as we walked into the school, Noah motioned for me to follow him. We made our way towards the gym, but this time, we took a turn down a hallway that I hadn’t explored before.

“We are looking for the principal's office. I’m hoping that’s the best way to draw him out.” Noah said as we continued exploring. Unfortunately, we didn’t get very far before we heard the same whistling I heard during my return trip. 

I turned around quickly while Noah clenched the dagger. 

“I’m not scared of you.” I snapped. 

“You’re so full of shit.” He snarled at me and walked at us faster. I hadn’t noticed it before, but it didn’t look like the principal could run. His legs looked like they were moving in slow motion. 

As I opened my mouth to say something back, I felt something hard hit the back of my head. I could hear Noah fighting something, but I lost consciousness shortly after being hit. When I opened my eyes, it felt like I was choking on blood; I spit as much out as I could. 

“Cass-” I could hear Noah mumble to me. 

Slowly, my head stopped spinning, and I could see where we were sitting. It was a classroom, my blood was all over the desk in front of me. The room was bright and empty aside from the rows of desks. 

“Tell me you have a plan,” I mumbled to Noah as I slowly got up. 

“Yeah, I have a pretty good idea. We will have to fight this guy the moment he comes into the room. We can’t waste any more time…” Noah said as he pulled himself out of his chair. 

“I just want to have a conversation.” The principal said as he opened the door to the classroom. 

I was shocked, he wanted to talk to us. After trying to kill us? I decided to play along, hoping that Noah would take the opportunity to kill him while I held him in a conversation. 

“Cassandra, I need you to stay here with me.” He started to say as he slowly shut the door. 

“I’m not staying here with you.” I snapped. As soon as the words left my mouth, he charged at me. I let him get as close as I could before turning to run. He grabbed my hair and I screamed. I brought my arms up to grab his wrist before I was suddenly let go. I could hear the principal screaming, and as soon as I turned around, Noah was sinking the dagger into his chest. 

The building started shaking, and I mean really shaking. I could see dust falling from the ceiling. 

“We have to run,” Noah said as he pulled out his dagger, and we made for the door. 

\-

I took off running after Noah, and that is when everything started falling apart. I could keep up with him for a second, but the ground cracked; it split right down the middle of the hallway. I screamed and was thrown to my side. 

As soon as I got back up, I screamed for Noah, but he had made it too far ahead of me. I couldn’t continue down the hallway because the ceiling was falling, so I had to turn around and backtrack. As I ran, I didn’t have time to think about the others. I took a left, and a baseball hit the wall three inches from my head. 

I slid in place and nearly fell for a second. There was nowhere else for me to go, so I charged forward, took a baseball to the shoulder, and screamed. I could feel my shoulder break. I tried to steady myself but as soon as I lifted my head; the man dressed in a baseball uniform slammed into my body. He pounced on me as if he was an animal. 

I shrieked as my back hit the floor and tried to use my good arm to push him back. His flesh was…peeling. His breath smelled like death, and it looked like his eyes were…melting. He was speaking, but I couldn’t understand. As I pushed on him with my good arm I could feel the ground beneath us give way. 

The feeling of weightlessness was intense; as I hit the ground under the floor, I screamed and wheezed. Before I could even attempt to get up, the killer put his hands around my neck and I bucked my hips. I moved my good arm to his neck and pushed the killer off of me. His flesh peeled off in my hand. 

As he stumbled back, a piece of the ceiling fell and crushed him. I could feel my eyes twitch before breaking out in screams. It felt like I couldn’t breathe. But there was no time to process; I had to keep running. 

\-

I must’ve landed in the basement, I scrambled to my feet and made a run for the first door I could see. I pushed it open, ready to run up a set of stairs or something. Instead, I found myself standing outside of the front door. 

“Cassandra!” Caleb yelled. He took my arm and tugged me to the side. My eyes were adjusting, everything was so bright it felt like my eyes were on fire. I was breathing heavily, my hands were shaking, and I felt like I was going to throw up. 

Once my eyes adjusted to the light I could see Emily, Caleb, and Noah standing before me. Pain surged through my body. I turned around to watch the school crumble, but it didn’t fall apart in the way I thought it would. The building itself cracked a few times before…disappearing and no I’m not joking. 

Once I could breathe again, I took my hurt arm in my good hand and started limping towards my car. 

“Did you guys bring anyone back?” I asked Caleb as we walked. 

“Two from the football field,” Caleb said before stopping me. 

“Are you going to be okay?” He asked me. I could feel his arm shaking, but I did appreciate that he was trying to stay calm for me. I told him that I was going to be okay, and that was the end of it. 

You won’t hear from us for a while. We need a break, and we have to focus on finding [Hannah](https://www.reddit.com/r/SpectralsMegaverse/comments/1iixmxm/spectrals_megaverse_2025/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).

She broadcasts this for the entire internet to see so there’s no way anybody remotely close to her isn’t concerned. I know it’s her “brand” and mostly rage bait but sleeping until noon, only leaving your house to buy coffee or go shopping, and then sitting on your phone every day isn’t healthy. Sure we don’t see everything but it just baffles me. It seems like she has no hobbies or interests which is just INSANE to me because DC is such a fun place to live when you’re in your 20’s if you go out and explore and try things. I’m not saying she has to get up at 6am every day and join a gym but I just don’t understand why you wouldn’t take advantage of this life if you had the means to do so. 

I followed her when she was in college and I thought she was so fun and bubbly and cool and now it’s just kind of a train wreck to watch. I really hope she’s able to get some sort of help because this “lifestyle” is so unsustainable. ",7,1738829696.0,darcymcqueeny,0,1.0,False
