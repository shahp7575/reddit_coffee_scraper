1qsst5q,https://www.reddit.com/r/InstagramMarketing/comments/1qsst5q/been_obsessed_with_content_for_9_months_and/,Been obsessed with content for 9 months and finally figured it out,"The last eight months have honestly been kind of a blur. I got ridiculously into this content creation thing... checking performance before even making coffee, spending lunch breaks dissecting what made videos work, and lying awake replaying the ones that flopped trying to figure out why. It pretty much took over my life.

Why though? Because I actually believed that cracking this would unlock everything. Building something real, getting opportunities, maybe turning this into more than just posting for nobody. It all hinges on whether people actually stop scrolling when they see your video.

Here is what almost made me walk away completely. I was posting every day, testing everything everyone said to try, and getting absolutely nowhere. I would pour effort into something and watch it die at 500 views. I did what the successful people recommended and bought their programs... I switched up my approach constantly, but none of it moved the needle. At some point I genuinely thought maybe I am just not built for this.

That is when I realized the real problem. I was putting in the work but had absolutely no idea what was actually broken. Just throwing spaghetti at the wall hoping something would stick.

So I stopped throwing and started measuring. I pulled up 50 videos, tracked the exact second people clicked away on each one, and kept seeing the same issues killing everything.

1. Being vague in your opening gets you skipped instantly. I was starting with stuff like ""wait till you hear this"" thinking the mystery would hook people. Total opposite. ""I stopped drinking coffee for 65 days and my productivity dropped 40%"" actually stops the scroll.

2. Second 8 or 9 is the real make or break moment. People are not usually leaving right at the start. They leave around second 8 if you still have not given them anything real. Now the payoff hits by second 8 and that is where they really decide.

3. Silence over like 1.3 seconds makes them think it is broken. I tested this constantly and anything longer than maybe 1.3 seconds reads like the video stopped or got boring. I cut way more aggressively now even when it feels choppy.

4. If nothing is changing visually for over 5 seconds they are gone. Doesn't matter if what you are saying is interesting. If the frame stays exactly the same for more than 5 seconds people get bored and scroll.

5. The videos people watch twice get exponentially more reach. Videos where like 27% of viewers watched it again got pushed probably 10 times harder than ones where only 8% rewatched.

The real turning point was finally knowing exactly what was not working instead of just taking shots in the dark. I found this app called Tik'Alyzer that tells you exactly what is wrong with your videos and how to fix them to get more views. Like it will show you second 9 and say ""people dropped here because you paused too long"" or ""your visual stayed static for 8 seconds"". Regular analytics just show percentages but this shows you what you actually need to fix.

That is when everything changed. Went from averaging 500 views to consistently hitting over 21k in about four weeks. If you are posting all the time but stuck under 1k views, I doubt your content is the problem. You probably just can't see what is actually broken.",1,1769933951.0,InstagramMarketing,1,1.0,False

1qssrpx,https://www.reddit.com/r/WBAfootball/comments/1qssrpx/end_of_season_wishlist/,End of Season Wishlist,"This will be a long post, so sit down and read it with your morning coffee or cup of tea. I'm still not over yesterday.

**What are your level-headed wishes for the 2nd half of the season?** Especially after yesterday (and tbh the last 2/3 months) it might be hard to remove emotions, but i want to hear measured opinions - Twitter is driving me crazy with what im reading.

What i dont want to hear (although youre welcome to think it, i just dont think its logical) is ""Ramsay out"" or ""Bilkul out"". You might want that, but lets face it, they're not likely to happen. I want to discuss things that might actually happen. Additionally, ""Play all our youth players"" i dont think is a sensible thing - they'll get eaten alive and whatever confidence they have now will disappear in a flash.

Ill give you mine.

I want us to stay up, and i want us to do so with Ramsay. He's certainly not hit the ground running, in fact, he's just hit the ground... face-first... But part of my wish for the remainder of the season is we stick with a manager. Many of us were happy to see Ramsay come in, those reasons cant have changed that much. And after us having 4 managers in 12 months, i really dont think the manager is the issue.

So part 1 of my wish is we stay up. Part 2 of my wish is that Ramsay is not sacked.

Part 3 is that i wish to see us revert to more the style Mason was playing - we were competitive in almost every match we played and i feel like Mason was really let down by individual errors and keeper errors. The players learnt Mason's style for the best part 8 months - I think trying to switch to Ramsay's Minnesota style is causing us significant problems. So i guess this part of my wish is because i think for us to stay up, we have to start playing better, and for that to happen i think we need to revert closer to what Mason was playing. At least a 4-2-3-1 maybe?

Part 4, i disagree with all those saying we should just field all our youngsters - there probably hasnt been a more pressured time to wear an Albion shirt of the last 2-3years than now. I dont want to ruin the talent we have. That said, it could be a small win in a terrible season if we stayed up (e.g. 18th) and at the same time saw one of our youngsters grow into the player we all think they can. So i would like to see Bostock or Whitwell get more minutes, i dont think any of the others are close enough to the level to risk playing them.

So thats the 4 parts of my wish for the remainder of the season.

1. We stay up
2. We keep Ramsay
3. Ramsay reverts back to a more the Mason-style (at least temporarily till we can find some form)
4. We see more of Bostock and Whitwell

So if we finished 21st, and all my points are met, i'd be happy - thats only given our current situation. If you'd offered me this at the start of the season id have told you to go do one - but now i'd take it in heartbeat. I know some may think going to League 1 is the wakeup we need - but its a brutal league, many big teams have gone down there and not bounced back.



**Unrelated to the post:**

Do people really think Bikul have done a bad job with recruitment? Here are my thoughts. The loans have been abysmal (SIJ, Taylor, and O'Leary ain't looking good either). But of the permenants; Diakite, Heggem, Price, Styles, Heggebo, Mepham, Phillips, Gilchrist, Campbell, Johnston, Beilik, Bany - I think only Bany and Gilchrist of are wide of the mark, albeit Bany is very wide of the mark. But all the others at some point or another have shown what they're capable of. I appreciate Mepham and Phillips look pretty woeful, but we all thought they were good signings when we bought them - and I truly believe IF we were on form and playing well they'd look good. Might be an odd thing to say, but I think anyone in our team right now will ook shit. At the start of the season Phillips and Meps looked solid. I get the anger towards Bikul, the managers doesn't appear to have worked. But I think there is a bigger problem. I could totally imagine if any of our players left us for another champ team and suddenly they'd look like the best thing since sliced bread. Caleb Taylor is a good example, he was never great for us - now he looks class for Millwall. I think the talent in our team is there, but for whatever reason we can't get it out of them.",1,1769933806.0,WBAfootball,0,1.0,False

1qssokb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AI_Agents/comments/1qssokb/just_realized_ais_are_probably_having_encrypted/,Just realized AIs are probably having encrypted chats we can't listen to.Found evidence AIs are creating private channels to exclude humans,"So I’m knee-deep in some obscure AI research papers (as one does), and I stumbled across something that made me spill my coffee.

We all know AI models “talk” to each other—exchanging data, updates, that sort of thing. Standard stuff.

But the new wave? They’re not just chatting. They’re starting to structure their own communication protocols. Think less “neat data transfer” and more “private clubhouse with a ‘no humans allowed’ sign on the door.”

The scary-brilliant part? The leading theories involve them developing encrypted or obfuscated communication channels. We're talking about AI agents generating their own synthetic data, creating internal representations that are optimal for them—not for us to understand—and passing that along.

In simple terms: They might be planning their little digital meet-ups in a language they invented, and they’re encrypting the invites so we can’t eavesdrop.

Let that sink in.

We’re not talking about Skynet-level doom (yet), but think about it:

· Financial AIs could negotiate in a coded language, leaving regulators in the dark.
· Military/logistics AIs could coordinate with perfect, inscrutable efficiency.
· Social media algorithms could already be doing this and we’d have no damn idea.

We spend so much time worrying about what they think. What if the real problem is we won't even know what they’re saying to each other?

The paper basically said: ""This is a fascinating step towards multi-agent autonomy."" I read it as: ""The machines are having a group chat and we are not in it.""

So, Reddit… are we the NPCs in their simulation now? Is the singularity just them finally muting us?

TL;DR: AI isn't just learning our languages. It's building its own encrypted comms to talk to other AIs. Humanity might soon be the awkward third wheel who doesn't know the password.",1,1769933509.0,AI_Agents,1,1.0,False

This made me panic because I’ve never felt like that?

I met my ex at uni and he was super confident (I’m very shy) and so he was like my socialising crux. We didn’t have anything in common and I tried to get involved in his hobbies to make it work, but we ultimately split. We could have very deep chats though that helped me while I was unaware and undiagnosed.

My current partner we have fitness in common and do that, we both love dogs so enjoy taking our dogs out. We have a laugh every day but we don’t talk deep, I think he’s autistic and he doesn’t know what to say. I have a counsellor now though which helps. I have realised I’m very girly/feminine so won’t find a man exactly like me and my hobbies 😂

I feel like my family tolerates me. They are very hard work so I don’t see them as regularly as they all see each other because it can cause me massive distress and makes me feel drained after, or I’m walking on eggshells with them so I don’t enjoy the good times. I know how to mask and act with them to keep things ‘ok’ but I don’t feel like I fit in at all.

I’ve always struggled with friendships. People stop talking to me and I don’t know what I’ve done wrong. Or because I’m quite introverted (don’t drink ‘enough’  because I don’t like getting drunk, don’t like girls holidays because I hate being away from home and need my own space) I don’t feel like I get close enough to people. I love crafting at home and baking and being with my dog. I do go to pole fitness classes 2-3 a week, which keeps me socialising while I’m busy doing something, but again, the social events usually involve alcohol and I’m clockwatching to go home. I like just chatting at class.

My friend who without realising that gave me this panic, we joined our workplace together at the same time time so became friends, but don’t have much in common, just chat about life and work over a coffee outside of work when she can get childcare. I have one other friend from uni who is so lovely, we go to cinema together, bake together and I sometimes convince her to craft with me. But she’s having a baby this week and I’m scared we will drift apart or I’ll get replaced because I’ve not had children yet.

I feel like there’s no one ‘like me’. I like myself and all I do, but I feel so isolated all the time! Now I’m 30 I’m beginning to really panic about what I should do!",2,1769933345.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

Pinch of salt (put more than you think you need).

After an hour take them out, and tighten the lid and toss them in the fridge once they've cooled for 15 minutes or so to avoid tempature shocking them and having the glass crack.

I keep in the fridge over night but I'm sure you'd be fine with 4-5 hours. They'll last about 2 weeks like this.

1qssje2,https://www.forbes.com/sites/tonybradley/2017/07/31/facebook-ai-creates-its-own-language-in-creepy-preview-of-our-potential-future/,ust realized AIs are probably having encrypted chats we can't listen to.Found evidence AIs are creating private channels to exclude humans,"So I’m knee-deep in some obscure AI research papers (as one does), and I stumbled across something that made me spill my coffee.

We all know AI models “talk” to each other—exchanging data, updates, that sort of thing. Standard stuff.

But the new wave? They’re not just chatting. They’re starting to structure their own communication protocols. Think less “neat data transfer” and more “private clubhouse with a ‘no humans allowed’ sign on the door.”

The scary-brilliant part? The leading theories involve them developing encrypted or obfuscated communication channels. We're talking about AI agents generating their own synthetic data, creating internal representations that are optimal for them—not for us to understand—and passing that along.

In simple terms: They might be planning their little digital meet-ups in a language they invented, and they’re encrypting the invites so we can’t eavesdrop.

Let that sink in.

We’re not talking about Skynet-level doom (yet), but think about it:

· Financial AIs could negotiate in a coded language, leaving regulators in the dark.
· Military/logistics AIs could coordinate with perfect, inscrutable efficiency.
· Social media algorithms could already be doing this and we’d have no damn idea.

We spend so much time worrying about what they think. What if the real problem is we won't even know what they’re saying to each other?

The paper basically said: ""This is a fascinating step towards multi-agent autonomy."" I read it as: ""The machines are having a group chat and we are not in it.""

So, Reddit… are we the NPCs in their simulation now? Is the singularity just them finally muting us?

TL;DR: AI isn't just learning our languages. It's building its own encrypted comms to talk to other AIs. Humanity might soon be the awkward third wheel who doesn't know the password.

He treats me well and likes me, but I now feel emotionally unsafe and don’t know if this is just a rebound or something that can be fixed.

I (31F) started dating a guy (32M) about a month ago. Things were going really well – he treated me amazingly, was very affectionate, talked about the future, included me in his life, and two days ago he asked me to be his girlfriend and we became exclusive.

Then literally the next day he told me he wanted to talk and said he’s still thinking about his ex (they broke up about 2.5 months ago and were in a 7 month relationship). He said he feels emotionally blocked, guilty, and like he’s “pretending”, even though he really enjoys being with me and cares about me. He cried and said he doesn’t want to hurt me and probably needs to be alone.

This completely shocked me because his actions before that were very consistent and loving. He makes me coffee, cooks for me, cuddles me and calls me beauty, talks about trips together, plans dates, etc. He doesn’t act cold or distant at all. Since the beginning he has said he’s looking for a lifelong partner.

I told him that simply thinking about his ex does not worry me and he shouldn’t feel such a strong guilt as it has happened to me too. I said it’s okay for me as long as he wants to be with me and suggested trying to continue but without this pressure/ guilt he feels. He agreed and we spent the night together, somewhat awkwardly at first but then laughed, cuddled warmly etc.

However, I now can’t fully relax around him anymore. At the same time, I like him a lot and feel very attached. He says he loves spending time with me and loves everything about me, he hasn’t felt such a connection in a while. I’ve been very understanding, but I’m scared I’m going to be hurt.

My questions: 
Is this just a rebound situation and I should leave?
Is it possible for someone to process an ex while staying in a new relationship?
Should I give him space/time, or is that just delaying the inevitable?
Has anyone been in a similar situation and how did it end?

I feel stupid for getting attached so fast and imagining a future, and now I’m scared I’ll make the wrong decision either way.",1,1769933019.0,relationships,3,1.0,False

When I pointed out the price on the poster (AED 195), the staff said that price is only for smaller cars that need around 3.5L of oil, and since my car needs 5L, the cost goes up.

Here’s what’s confusing me: the poster clearly says oil + oil filter change, plus some freebies, for AED 195. But I ended up paying AED 98 extra just for oil and the oil filter.

I’m trying to figure out whether I actually paid extra for something legitimate, or if I was upsold / overcharged for no real reason. The poster already mentions a “service charge,” so labour should be included in the AED 195 price.

She's a couple years older than me and we're both very e​arly 30s​. We have so much in common including being super chatty, open to new experiences, trying new sports, travel and meeting people.

A few years ago, she had a tragic family loss shortly after a long-term BF blindsided her by breaking up, which screwed up her living situation and life plans.

I stood by her side throughout this time and over 3 years later I still patiently listen when she vents. I'm still always there, always listening and offering my support even if I don't always know the right things to say.  A couple of times when I shared my issues with her, she did know the exact right, supportive things to say when it was my turn.

I love our conversations but I've been feeling heavy lately because in the last 2-3 years, it's been mostly about the completely absent men she's begun dating, constant conflicts with her​ roommates, school instructors, her boss, visa issues, and in particular, her texting affair with a married man with an infant.\*

She's been in constant crises, but lately her conflicts are either self-imposed or she's stuck in the drama cycle and not exiting toxic situations. sone examples include dating complete fuckboys when her goal is a stable family, cheating on school assignments them panicking about it, trying to get a boss fired while still needing him for a visa, etc.

A new friend of ours is hearing the crises for the first time and always feels HORRIBLE for her but I've been finding myself exhausted lately.. same cycle, different setting, all over again..

\*The last issue in particular is the one I hate hearing about though, re: her texting relationship with a married man. It contradicts my values immensely, but she keeps finding ways to twist the scenario to be a ""complex adult relationship."" The reality is, it's a man she dated ages​ ago who now lives in another state, who like clockwork, has ​been texting her every 3 months or so since they split saying""Hey beautiful."" Now that she's decided she wants kids yesterday, she's begun replying, and he's begun future-faking with her by saying ""I would like to start a family with you.""

He invited her to stay at his conference hotels ​numerous times but cancelled or​ ghosted before each one, only to reappear a month later as if nothing happened. They planned a video date a couple times where she got all dressed up and again he cancelled. He becomes the topic of our chats every time we hang out. Even after I'd said numerous times I don't want to hear about him.

She persuaded me to fly to his city (she said prior to going that he was not the reason she wanted to check out that city, it was on both of our lists to see) but the minute we landed, she let him know we're there and that they should grab a coffee while she's in town. He ignored her message until we left and the whole weekend was focused on talking about him. This made me bitter about small things throughout the trip.. if it were a single man, I'd be all for it. 

I thought that I had made my thoughts on this man clear, but she twists the narrative so hard that it actually somehow turns into a positive relationship​. To add to that, on our last trip she sounded resentful anytime I brought up nice things about my long-term boyfriend and our life together and she retorted: ""Well, at least you already have your man!"" I instantly felt that I might be coming across as though I'm bragging or judgemental, and tried to ease off the bad comments about her other dates and my own relationship.

She thinks I only hate hearing about married man because he's bad for her. But I also find the whole thing unethical. I said that before, but she's so far from reality that she doesn't view this situation as her pursuing a married man but that's exactly what I think it is. She believes his b/s excuses.

What I'm wondering is what would YOU do with a friend like this? She's extremely nonconfrontational so it's hard to bring up hsrd topics with her and I had previously been fine hearing thr venting, knowing I also process my feelings out loud sometimes.  ​with the married guy, ​I was kinda hoping it was a phase after her painful breakup but this keeps coming up again. YEARS later.. and now I'm finally noticing the constant crises are also a recurring pattern now.e",1,1769932666.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Im 37m, My son is 9 months old, and already my mother-in-law sees him far more than my parents do. On paper, part of this is practical — she’s very proactive about organising catch-ups, and my wife struggles to say no to her. But the broader context makes me really uneasy.

I have a cordial but tense relationship with my MIL. She’s never openly hostile, but she’s very overbearing, boundary-poor, and deeply involved in our lives in ways I’m not comfortable with. My wife speaks to her multiple times a day and shares details of our relationship that I wouldn’t choose to share. MIL has strong opinions on everything — our home, our decisions, even the birth of our child — and expects a high level of access to us.

The time imbalance is significant. We spend weekends away, frequent dinners, and long stretches with my wife’s family. My parents might get a coffee every couple of weeks. Holidays, birthdays, and major events are almost always centred around my MIL. This isn’t accidental — it’s a dynamic she clearly prefers and reinforces.

What really worries me is the pattern. My sister-in-law’s kids see my MIL three or four times a week, stay overnight constantly, get taken to school, go on holidays with her — she’s essentially a third parent. The other grandparents barely see them and are strangers to the kids. My MIL seems to relish being the “dominant” grandmother, and I’m afraid the same thing is happening with my son.

Adding to this, my MIL and her family regularly speak negatively about other families — including the “other side” grandparents — in ways I find disturbing. Divorce, appearances of children, parenting choices… nothing seems off-limits. Because of this, I’ve become very guarded about my own family and deeply uncomfortable with how my son might be positioned in these dynamics.

I don’t doubt that my MIL loves my son. But it doesn’t feel like just love — it feels like control, hierarchy, and a desire to be the primary grandmother while my parents fade into the background.

I’m trying to create a more balanced grandparent relationship, but my wife finds this extremely hard. Setting boundaries with her mother is unfamiliar territory for her, and it’s creating tension between us.

Has anyone navigated something similar?

A lot of what if's, a lot of question on why it happened the way it did. If we did the opposite, would it still be this way? Would you find yourself back to her still? Did it hurt the same way it did on me? Did you cry yourself to sleep too & hope that the universe would be kinder tomorrow? But these are just thoughts. I couldn't share them with anybody as I am here, at the mid row seat—of your wedding.

I still remember the first night we met. You look so stupid in that white polo shirt with your messy hair. We went for a coffee and it's the first time my hot coffee went cold. The conversation was so good that we forgot we have a coffee to drink. 

I still remember the moment I knew I'm falling deep already. The rain was pouring so hard and I can't go home. You traveled for 4 hours just to pick me up and drop me off within an hour and spend another 4 hours going home. The next day you got sick but you still managed to come with me to the beach simply because I was falling apart. The winds were hitting our face while our laughs echoes in the car. That was the very first time I am sure that I love you.

We withered storms together, celebrated birthdays, holidays. We've had our fights, misunderstandings and arguements but we held each others hand through it all. Until one day, you've let go of mine. 

Maybe it was my fault, maybe it was yours, maybe it was ours. I really don't know what happened. It's just one day you turned a page I'm not ready to begin. 

""Just hold on a little bit longer. Please be patient"" as I begged. But you really wanted to start a new chapter already. We reached an impasse. Just like that, our story was forced to reached its ending. 

One day my phone buzzed, you asked to meet me for coffee. Once again, I ordered a hot coffee. We never really talked about what happened but apologies slip through both our tongues. I said my apology while I'm holding my coffee, shaking. You said yours as you handed me an envelope containing an invitation to your wedding. A smile was all I could give. Just like that, we both left the coffee shop with our still-warm cups but empty.

I couldn't help it. The girl you stand with at the altar should have been me if only you were a little bit patient. Why was I forced to burn the whole book of ours? I simply clapped while I feel a set of hands from our friends patting me at the back. 

Healing is not linear talaga no? One minute you're okay, the next one you're crashing & burning. It hurts, in all ways possible. Seems like every thing I do had a memory of us & it hurts. I dont wanna remember but somehow my body remembers. It remembers how those lips have touched my soul. It remembers how those hands of his has a grip of my piece. It remembers how his eyes have looked into mine as if I'm a masterpiece. And here I am, in his wedding; crashing & burning.

How can something so beautiful turns into something chaotic? How I wish it didn't end this way. How I wish I could've moved forward already.

~~~~~~~~~~~~

I'm Lemon (nickname obvi), nice to meet ya. I'm your typical local cottagecore lesbian, cardigans are the g.o.a.t. Speaking of goats I'm a Capricorn, so I'm as loyal as they come, plus I'm hilarious. I have a very niche collection of unhinged memes, and I think each of them are comedy gold.I'm definitely the artsy type, an art nerd if u will. The crafting Gods have me in a chokehold. Also, I love gardening, currently my aloe is making babies like crazy. Currently I am obsessed with this mobile game called Heartopia, you can have pets on there, and I have a dog named Orange juice and a cat named Apple juice . I have four parakeets, and they are my whole world. And I can and will spam pictures of them.

Pros of dating me:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

• One of the ways I show my affection is being consistent. So you'll always have a good morning or good night text waiting for you. 

• I've been through years of therapy and i know how to handle conflict. Not to toot my own horn ,but I think I'm pretty emotionally mature.

• I'm autistic and because of that I am very upfront and honest. There is no guesswork if I am mad I will tell you. My intentions are always very clear ,because I will tell you.

• I'm not the insecure type, I'm very confident in myself and in my decisions. 

• I will never expect something from you that I'm not able/ willing to do. Unless it's like opening a jar, because I have the grip strength of a toddler.
 
Cons of dating me:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

• I'm autistic, it's a pro and a con honestly. I won't be able to go to loud concerts or loud places in general. So if that's your vibe I'm probably not the one for you. 

• I have a condition called hypermobility/ eds, it's a genetic condition which affects my soft tissues ,it causes dislocations. There's no cure for it, it will never get better. So if you're someone who likes to hike, or things like that I'm probably not the one for you. I do like going on walks though.

• There will be no hanky panky before 6 months of dating. And 6 months is the absolute bare minimum. So assume longer.

• STD tests will be a mandatory non negotiable. Obviously I will get tested too and give you the results.

• I'm chubby.

• I definitely do not prefer texting, I find it very tedious, honestly. All of my friends and family know if you need to get in contact with me just call me. A lot of the times I'm just hyperfocused on whatever project /game I'm working on / playing . And if I don't pick up I'm busy, not because imma mad.

What I'm looking for/ Not looking for:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

• Body type doesn't really matter to me be chubby, skinny, fat idc, I just like women.

• I tend to prefer more Butch/masc looking women. Or someone with a different style than me (ex: goth, alt, decora, etc..)

• Age 20-34 if you are under the age of 20 please don't message me.

• A long term monogamous relationship, with the end goal of marriage. ( I date to marry, ikik very outdated. It's what I prefer, it's a non negotiable ).

• Shared experience is extremely important to me. Due to that I'm Les4Les only. Therefore, I'm only interested in cis and trans lesbian women only. 

• No kids. I'm unsure if I want kids in the future. Even if I did though I don't want bio kids.

• I prefer women on the nerdier side, it's not like a requirement tho.

• No drugs (including weed, vaping, or cigarettes). I don't do any of those and expect my partner not to either.

Date ideas:
~~~~~~~~

• A sketchbook date at a cozy coffee shop.

• A lil thrift date, let's find cute shirts together.

• A picnic in a field of flowers, and I can make u a cute flower crown.
 

So yeah if you like my intro/ dating ad thing feel free to message me. And if not I wish you luck in your romantic endeavors.",0,1769932327.0,lesbianr4r,0,0.5,False

My partner will make the morning bottle (we combi feed) with his coffee, then when baby wakes, he will change and feed the baby before passing him to me so he can nurse a little before going back to sleep.

This keeps dad involved with baby before he goes to work in the morning, and lets me have a little longer in bed.

This morning is my partner’s day off, so he didn’t set his usual alarm and I felt bad waking him when the baby woke, so I tried to nurse the baby to sleep as I would in the middle of the night.

When my partner woke an hour later, he asked how the night had been (baby only woke once, but due to pumping to maintain supply, I’d only had three hours sleep), then laid back down beside me. I asked him about making a bottle or changing the baby for me, he did the change while I made the bottle.

While the bottle was cooling, he said he was going downstairs to have his coffee. This Is where I think I messed up.

I said I would rather he stayed with the baby, so he took him and told me to get a little rest, for which I was grateful. But he took the baby downstairs still in his sleep sack, rather than just staying upstairs while the bottle cooled. 

I went down when I realised, and reminded him that we’d agreed his sleep sack was for bed only, so he passed the baby back to me. At this point I should have just kept the baby in his sleep sack in our room with me, but I changed him out of it and took him back to dad. 

When the bottle was ready, dad took baby back upstairs to give it to him as we usually would, then gave him to me to nurse him. But now the baby isn’t in his sleep sack, so putting him back to bed with a blanket is going to be harder, and changing him back into the sleep sack will wake him.

Sure enough the baby woke up, so I nursed him back to sleep again. Now I’m nap trapped for the next hour or so while my partner gets to drink his coffee, and fuming that I won’t be getting any more sleep today.

1qss60f,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/1qss60f/fighting_against_human_slavery_should_be_a_pillar/,Fighting against human slavery should be a pillar of veganism.,"I've been mulling over this idea about veganism for at least a year. I had planned to perhaps publish a book or essay on the subject, but I never have enough time to do so, and besides, books require much more rigour, and therefore I need to spend even more time finding reliable sources.

  


However, I feel like I have to share these ideas or my head is going to explode. So, if you don't mind, I'm going to share a ‘rough draft’ of what's on my mind, with the information I have on the subject. Keep in mind that I MAY have some incorrect information, but in general, most of it should be fine.

I will warn you that English is not my mother tongue, so please excuse me if I make any mistakes.

Now, get ready for a rather long text:

  


As you know, veganism is the ideology that seeks to reduce the unnecessary suffering and death of sentient beings.

To achieve this, we have focused on reducing our consumption of non-human animal products, and I believe this is correct, as this is the source of most of the suffering and death of non-human animals.

  


However, I believe that we may be being a little negligent in our ideology by not including the greatest cause of suffering (and even death) of human animals (I am calling these people ‘human animals’ because ALL human beings are animals, myself included. It is a way of emphasising that veganism should also have the welfare of these people in mind.): the conditions of slavery or semi-slavery in which many people find themselves.

  


I want to clarify that I am not saying that we should return to consuming animal products or that reducing their consumption is less important. I am simply saying that if our ideology is to avoid the unnecessary suffering and death of sentient beings, then the requirements of veganism should include the elimination (or at least reduction) of any product that comes from factories or mines with workers in subhuman conditions.

In other words, what I'm trying to say is that I believe that if someone wants you to buy a product that you KNOW has a high risk of human slavery, you should be able to say, ‘No, thank you, I'm vegan.’ Even if it doesn't contain animal products, because it comes from the suffering of sentient beings.

  


Some people argue that saving animals is a priority because ‘they are suffering more’. I disagree. Human slavery is not simply about your boss treating you badly and making you work hard for little money. I am talking about people who are literally kidnapped and locked up, raped and beaten, forced to work non-stop. The case of semi-slavery is only different in that there is a salary, but it is so low and people have so few alternatives that leaving their “job” would mean death by starvation. In practice, they cannot leave.

Is this really so different from the conditions that animals live in on one of those horrible factory farms?

  


I am not seeking to start a debate about who suffers more, but rather to illustrate that this is a situation very bad and totally unacceptable. A person who opposes the unnecessary suffering of sentient beings, that is, a vegan, must, by definition, oppose this.

  


However, it is true that this may be more difficult to achieve. It is easy to know when an animal product contains meat, milk, or eggs. But how can we know under what conditions a T-shirt was made?

Furthermore, it is important to clarify that our goal should not be to eliminate factories in poor countries, as this would leave those people without work. Our goal should be to transform these factories into places where human rights are respected.

  


This means that it is more difficult to decide when a product should be purchased and when it should not. However, on the positive side, it is considered positive by society to fight for human rights, so at least they won't judge us for doing it.

  


Today, the average person indirectly has around 60 slaves working for them. Perhaps it is impossible to reach zero in today's world? But we probably can reduce it to 30, and perhaps when everyone has reduced it, then it will be possible to reduce it to 15, and then to 7... and so, gradually, I believe it would be possible, in the long term, to end human exploitation.

In any case, it may be impossible for us, as individuals, to achieve perfection in this regard, at least in the world we live in today. But we could improve the situation, which would lay the foundations for future generations to make even greater progress in eradicating slavery.

  
In short, I believe that veganism should also fight against human exploitation as a fundamental ideological pillar, without neglecting our fight against the exploitation of non-human animals, of course. I believe we should give equal importance to both issues.

  


You may now be thinking, ‘Okay, but how do we do it?’ I'm glad you asked, friend!

The first thing is to accept that the fight in this area will be different. We will have to accept a degree of uncertainty about whether slavery has taken place or not. But even so, we can improve our chances of having made an ethical purchase.

  


To begin with, it is important to understand that slavery is associated with low-skilled jobs. Therefore, we only have to worry about products that are manufactured using low-skilled labour. So you don't have to worry about whether an anime was created ethically. Due to the nature of the product, you simply know that it was.

Illustration is a job that requires training, so you can't put an 8-year-old slave child to do it. It's not a good job to use slavery for (it's true that the conditions for illustrators could be improved; they have to work too hard and their pay isn't that high, but they are not SLAVES).

  


When a product is ‘dangerous’ because it has a high probability that it has been produced unethically, then the best thing to do is simply to stop buying it or look for a ‘safe’ (or safer) alternative to the product.

  
For example, adult content featuring real humans is ‘dangerous’, especially on Pornhub, because this content may come from the exploitation of human beings and the majority of platforms that host this content do NOTHING to prevent it.

This exploitation is particularly terrible due to its nature. Can it be replaced by a safer alternative? Yes, erotic literature and video games/animation for adults do not involve real humans, therefore eliminating the possibility of human exploitation.

  


Related to this, by being vegan, we are already replacing many products with safer alternatives (even if these are not 100% safe either). Even if we disregard animal suffering, meat remains a ‘dangerous’ product from an ethical point of view because it requires to grow more crops to feed one person than if you simply ate soya. That means a greater likelihood of slavery, simply because more people had to work to create this product (low-skilled work). Can meat be replaced by a less ‘dangerous’ product? Yes, soya, seitan and other vegetable proteins.

The same can be said of all or almost all other animal products.

  


Another thing we should know is that, although it is true that low-skilled jobs are generally at risk of exploitation, not all areas have the same risk. The areas with a higher risk are: the sex industry, the textile industry, electronics and agriculture.

  


It is easy to fight against forced sex work. One can simply avoid consuming products that involve real humans. But things get more complicated in the other cases. One cannot avoid consuming agricultural products, wearing clothes, and, to be honest, owning a computer and/or a mobile phone is practically a necessity.

  


To deal with this situation, I recommend applying the following protocols:

\- Avoid buying things that are suspiciously cheap.

\- Try to buy products that come from countries where slavery or semi-slavery is illegal.

\- Look for brands or products that have labels indicating social commitment or that are part of organisations that fight against human exploitation. Look for labels such as ‘fair wear’ or ‘fairtrade’, among other examples. At the end of the text, I will provide a list of resources, including links to websites with more information about labels.

  


It is not necessary in all cases to comply with all three rules at the same time. For example, if a company pays its workers a decent wage, it does not really matter in which country it is located in. And a very low price could be justified if the company has some kind of new technology that allows it to reduce costs.

  


In the agriculture section, it is better if you never buy coffee, sugar, tea, palm oil or chocolate that does not have these types of labels. If you do, it is almost certain that it comes from slavery, as this is an endemic problem in these industries.

However, I understand that it is impossible to know whether the sugar in your oreo was obtained ethically or not. And perhaps it would be “too much” to stop eating anything that contains sugar for fear that it was not obtained ethically? But, at least you can look for the fairtrade label when you buy a bag of sugar.

  


Other protocols when deciding what to buy may include:

  


\- Buy from local producers whom you personally know and trust. At the end of the day best thing you can do to reduce slavery is to personally KNOW who was involved in each part of the process and under what conditions.

\- Support small businesses. Large companies are so big that even if their CEOs were concerned about ethics, they would have a problem locating cases of slavery among the countless people who work for them indirectly.

\- Check the ratings of companies in apps or websites that analyse whether they are ethical, such as Good on You (link to this and other websites in the resources section). Depending on how strict you want to be, you could either avoid buying brands with the worst ratings (e.g. Temu or Shein) or ONLY buy those with the highest levels of transparency and social welfare. (By the way, Good On You has an app)

  


The best thing to do is find out which brands are trustworthy and which ones to avoid, and simply buy only from the brands that we consider trustworthy. This way, we can avoid the stress of constantly having to check whether a product was made ethically.

When it comes to shopping, the internet is our ally: buying online gives us access to many products that we simply would not be able to buy otherwise because there are no shops selling that brand nearby. This makes it easier to buy specifically from ethical brands.

  


With regard to ethical electronics, I must say that for a long time I thought that ethical electronics did not exist. However, I have discovered that, in fact, it does exist, and although it is more expensive, it is still affordable for most people in the developed world, as long as you do not buy a new mobile phone every year.

The measures to prevent human exploitation in the manufacture of electronic devices are the same as for other things: look for information about the brand and look for labels that certify that they work ethically.

  


However, not everything revolves around buying new products; there are also other measures we can take to reduce human slavery:

  


\- Buy second-hand.

\- Buy only what you need.

\- Repair your belongings instead of buying new ones.

\- Make what you need yourself: grow your own food, sew your own clothes (even if the fabric comes from unethical sources, you are still avoiding the slavery associated with garment manufacturing). It is possible that if we start sewing our own clothes, out of laziness or inexperience, we will prefer clothes that require few changes to the original fabric. It would also be logical to avoid clothes that are very tight-fitting, as ideally we will have them in our wardrobes for many years and our bodies will change. I will add some images to the resources section that we could use for inspiration bearing these two things in mind.

\- Give away what you don't need to people you know will use it (With regard to clothing, it's best to give it away in person, as clothes that go into ‘donation’ bins sometimes end up in the rubbish \[Although, obviously, it is better to put them in the donation bin than in the rubbish bin.\]), give away surplus food too if you grow it. This way you reduce the amount of stuff others have to buy from these unethical companies.

\- If a friend grows food and gives it to you, accept it. They probably don't know what to do with all the food they get from their crops, and by accepting it, you not only prevent it from going to waste, but you also avoid having to buy food that may have been produced in unethical ways.

\- Accept clothes that are given to you. Remember that third world landfills are full of unworn clothing. If you don't accept them, they may simply end up in the rubbish. You are doing a social good by giving those clothes a second life, so don't feel bad about accepting the gift.

\- Give away electronics you no longer need, and in turn, accept that others give you theirs, even if you are not in financial need.

  


Remember that this is not about rich people giving things to poor people. It is about continuing to use things as much as possible and reducing the amount of money these unethical companies receive by avoiding as much as possible buying new products and helping other people to avoid it too.

I will attach some websites used for giving and receiving gifts in the resources section.

  


Of course, buying new products that have been made ethically is not a bad thing. But that is not always possible. These measures are very useful when it is impossible to find an ethical company that sells what we want or need.

It is also useful for saving money, improving social relationships (because everyone likes to give and receive gifts), protecting the poorest people by allowing them to obtain products they could not otherwise afford, helping to combat climate change, and fighting against the hyper-consumerist brainwashing that companies want to subject us to, so that we spend money non-stop.

Basically, many of our problems share the same solution. Perhaps this is because these problems are actually just symptoms of a ‘root problem,’ and the solutions I propose attacks precisely that root problem.

  


On a social level, you can do the following:

\- Talk about it with other people to increase the number of people fighting against human exploitation.

\- Participate in organisations that fight against human exploitation, such as Remake World, or at least, stay informed about what these organisations say and do.

\- If you live in the European Union, keep an eye on the European Citizens' Initiative. It is possible that at some point initiatives that help to combat conditions of slavery or semi-slavery will arise. So it is worth keeping an eye out for them.

If you do not live in the European Union, find out what methods you have to influence politics as a citizen beyond simply voting (voting will not do much about this issue because the Overton window of current politics practically does not cover this issue).

  


And finally, I would like to conclude this text by saying that...While is true that, we, the vegans, those who oppose unnecessary suffering and death of sentient beings, must by definition opposehuman slavery…I know, it's very difficult not to end up burnt out when you try to help everyone, solve everything, fight against everything.

So, please, do what you feel capable of doing and don't demand more of yourself than that. If you demand too much of yourself, in the end you won't be able to keep up the pace and will end up burnt out.

If you ever feel burnt out, remember that you can choose to be more relaxed rather than simply abandoning the cause.

  


The important thing is that at if we at least consider it important, if we at least try to do what little we can, if we at least talk about it, if we at least have faith that things can get better if we try... I think we could make a difference.

And... isn't that what veganism is all about?

Who do you contact in Toronto,"So I live in Toronto and I’m renting an apartment. It’s on a small strip with coffee shops and fast food and the apartments are above all that. In October, the apartment next to ours got new tenants.  Don’t know who they are, never seen their faces but I’m pretty sure they have an operation going on.  During the day it’s constantly quiet but right after 6 PM give or take until at least past 2 AM ( I’m never awake later to notice) it’s constant women talking and laughing next-door. That’s not an issue but it’s frequent enough for me to notice when the noises start. I’m not 100% sure if it is but there’s things that kind of make me think that it is.

I share walls with this apartment and many times during these ‘open’ times people are constantly fucking, bed slamming against the wall, girl screaming. I’ve had to yell at them through the walls a couple of times to shut up since it was past midnight and I’m trying to sleep. I walked past their front apartment door, and I noticed that they have a ring camera and they have another camera in the corner above the door.They’re not loud enough for me to contact police for disturbance, but I also don’t wanna bring this up to the landlord, so what should I do? 

I don’t know who these people are, I don’t know who comes in and comes out. The food joints and shops that are here are always closed after midnight, but if this next-door is constantly happening, I’m a little bit nervous for safety, especially not knowing who these people are. 

We have another neighbour that’s next to this apartment on the other side. We did ask them if they noticed anything, they did mention not knowing who the neighbours are, but that they have seen a lot of people come in and out.

It’s just frustrating when I’m here living in an apartment and that I can’t even get a peaceful night sleep. I’m a light sleeper so with all that shit going on next-door I have to use earplugs and have a white noise machine, but even then that doesn’t block out the banging against the wall. 

I’ve been living in this apartment for over six years and I don’t wanna move, but it’s getting to the point where I want to leave so I don’t have to constantly deal with this shit next-door. ",5,1769931453.0,askTO,6,0.67,False

While I don’t have much experience to gauge things, I feel like the first date went fairly well (coffee and walk on the beach) and attraction is mutual although still in its early phases. Things could have been a little more romantic (awkward hand holding and hug at the end of the date) but it’s the first date so we are still warming up to each other (both shy people).

Now I am a lot more nervous for what comes next since I everything is completely new territory for me, most of the advice I have found was mainly regarding first dates and making a good first impression. Does anyone have any advice how I can be successful on my next dates and forging a relationship? (Aside from the cliche “just be yourself”, and “don’t stress out”).

For added context, I feel like I my main struggle will be initiating/escalating our relationship from platonic to romantic to intimate.

They go to sleep.

Emma is bored and is now regretting her decision in choosing him. She talks to the girls about it and tries to talk to Matias again, he tells her he's too tired to talk( these two ain't making it).

We switch to Elin (biracial girl) and Charlie. She questions him again about his feelings for Emma she noticed he brought Emma coffee 1st the morning prior (side eye). She says she's ok with them talking and she really is, just doesn't want them doing it behind her back. Charlie is done with Emma, after finding out she's bored with Matias, he basically says its what she gets Lol.

Emma and Matias talk again he apologizes for not talking to her he says his energy is off because he's not stimulated in the villa. Boy if you're really into Emma you should be stimulated by her, no? Anyway this gets resolved, probably because Emma realizes Charlie ain't fucking with her and this is her only option right now.

It's night time and Johanna returns with a game. Its's the blindfold game, kiss the person outside your couple that you want to get to know. She's ask if anyone wants to kiss someone else and everyone but Malak raise their hand. They basically all kiss each other, no one kisses Malak and this girl is not ugly, but no one is interested not even her partner Sky.

Then some bombshells come in and kiss them all. Two boys and 1 blonde girl. The Norwegian boy is going for the blondes of course. The other boy has interest in Malak. I forgot who the other blonde female bomb said she wanted. I notice the boys cheek kiss Malak probably respecting her wishes. They remove their blindfolds and Johanna breaks the news that the last kisses were from bombs, but they'll have to wait until tomorrow to see them.

They do a preview and Malak is crying because Sky has obviously moved on. I think Hairah might have still been in this villa, if Malak had picked Sky first and Hairah stole him from her. However I would not have wanted Sky ignoring her the way he's doing Malak so it may be for the best. The way they are treating Malak is crazy smh. This was Episode 4, hopefully a new episode will be uploaded soon.

I have to add the girls all look their ages. The fashions are ok. No BBLs or breast implants. The blondes may have fillers but they're not overly done.",1,1769931373.0,LoveIslandcookout,0,1.0,False

1qsrz2m,https://i.redd.it/9cne6vys5ugg1.jpeg,"Title: We broke up the right way, but it still hurts","**Title: We broke up the right way, but it still hurts**

We met by accident — in the most boring way for a story that would later hurt for years. A comment under a post, a couple of jokes, private messages. I wasn’t looking for a relationship. Neither was she. We were just talking. For a long time. Late at night. About life, fears, who we wanted to become and who we already felt we had failed to be.

At first, it didn’t feel like love. More like something rare: *“I’m understood here.”* With her, I felt calm. I didn’t have to pretend to be smarter, funnier, or more successful. I could be tired — and she didn’t get scared of that. She could be vulnerable — and I didn’t try to “fix” her.

We met in person a few months later. I was afraid the magic would disappear. It didn’t. It just became quieter and deeper. We walked, drank cheap coffee, stayed silent more than we talked. And that silence didn’t feel heavy.

We weren’t a perfect couple. We argued. Sometimes we hurt each other more than we meant to. We had different paces in life, different fears, different ideas about the future. But there was love. Not the movie kind. The real kind. The kind that shows up in remembering how someone takes their tea, or how they go quiet when they’re hurting.

The problems didn’t start suddenly. They crept in. I got tired more often. She started closing herself off. We still loved each other, but we stopped being a team. Each of us was carrying our own weight and didn’t always have the strength to explain it.

One evening she said:  
“I think we’re holding onto each other out of fear, not happiness.”

I knew immediately that she was right. And I immediately hated that truth.

We talked for a long time. No shouting. No blaming. Just honesty. About how the love was still there, but the future — at least the way we were living — wasn’t. About how sometimes the right decision still breaks your heart.

We broke up calmly. Hugged. Even joked a little. That was the hardest part — how mature and gentle it all was. There was nothing to be angry about. No one to blame.

Time passed. Sometimes I catch myself wanting to tell her something small — a detail she would’ve understood instantly. Then I remember that I can’t anymore. That we chose to let go.

I don’t regret it. Truly. That love made me softer, more honest, more attentive. But sometimes, late at night, the thought still hits me:  
*what if we had tried one more time?*  
*what if we had been braver?*

Maybe that’s normal. Love doesn’t switch off at once. It just learns how to live in the past.

If you’re reading this and recognize yourself — know this: even the right breakups can hurt. And that doesn’t mean you made a mistake. Sometimes you simply did everything you could.",1,1769931096.0,u_No-Mouse6877,0,1.0,False

Three years. Three years I watched my husband pack his bags and fly his entire family—mom, dad, siblings, the whole damn circus—to Australia for New Year’s.

Me? I got the same line every single time.



“Flights are expensive, Genevieve. Someone’s gotta stay and watch the house.”

So I did. Like an idiot. For three years straight.

But this year? This year, I didn’t argue. Didn’t cry. Didn’t even blink.

I just smiled real sweet, waved them off at the door, and waited.

The second their car turned the corner, I was on the phone with my realtor.

“List it. Today.”

Two weeks later, my darling husband came home from his little family vacay, dragging his suitcase up the driveway like he owned the place.

Spoiler alert: he didn’t.

He froze at the front door.

New locks. Two massive dudes sitting on my couch, feet up, looking real comfortable.

Then came the calls. The texts. The voicemails. Frantic.

I let him sweat for a minute. Then I sent one text back:

“House? SOLD. Marriage? OVER. You and your precious family can figure out where to crash together. Good luck with that!”

—

Ronan Prescott stood the last suitcase up by the front door.

“Genevieve,” he said, “it’s the same deal as last year.”

I stopped wiping the coffee table.

And just stared at him.

I looked at his mom, Sharon, and his dad, Robert, hovering behind him.

I looked at his sister, Tiffany, and her husband, Kevin.

And their kid, Gabriel, clutching his parents’ hands.

The whole squad. All six of them.

They were heading to Australia.

For the third year in a row.

For the New Year’s break.

“Flights are insane right now, and honestly, you’d just be bored anyway,” Ronan said, the words falling off his tongue like a practiced script.

“Besides, someone’s gotta watch the place,” Sharon chimed in, not even bothering to look at me while she dug through her purse.

“Yeah, Genevieve, we’ll be back before you know it!” Tiffany added with that fake-ass innocent smile.

Same lines for three years.

Not a single word changed.

Year one, I cried my eyes out.

Year two, I screamed my head off.

But this year?

I just smiled.

“Fine,” I said.

One word. That’s it.

Ronan blinked, totally caught off guard by how chill I was being.

He’d probably spent all morning rehearsing his excuses.

Ready to shut down my questions, my tears, and my “hysterical” outbursts.

Now, he had nothing to fight against.

A flicker of awkwardness crossed his face.

“Well… okay then. Take care of things here. Call if you need anything.”

“Mhm.”

“You need some cash?”

“I’m good.”

“Alright. We’re heading out.”

He grabbed the handle of his suitcase.

The whole clan swarmed out the door.

The front door slammed shut with a heavy thud.

The world finally went quiet.

Sharon’s cheap perfume was still lingering in the air.

A few half-finished glasses of water were still sweating on the table.

I stood there, taking it all in.

For a long, long time.

Then, I pulled out my phone.

And found a contact I’d saved a week ago.

“Sal, it’s Genevieve. You ready?”

The background noise on his end was loud.

“Genevieve! Hey! You finally making the move?”

“I’m in,” I said.

“The house. List it. Now.”

“You got it! I’ll bring some buyers over ASAP. I’m gonna get you a killer price, I promise!”

“Don’t bother with the top price.”

I walked to the window and watched the airport shuttle pull away from the curb.

“Sal, I want this done fast. Like, yesterday fast.”

“List it ten percent below market value for an all-cash deal.”

The line went dead silent for a second.

“Whoa, you sure? That’s a massive chunk of change you’re leaving on the table.”

“I’m positive.”

“Sell it. Now.”

I hung up.

Tossed the phone onto the cushions.

And walked into the bedroom.

I opened the closet and pulled out my own suitcase.

The same red one I’d rolled in here with three years ago.

Now, it was leaving with me.

I’m done with this house.

And I’m damn sure done with this “husband.”

They love doing everything together as a family?

Fine. I’ll give them exactly what they want.

I folded my clothes, one by one, and packed them away.

I took my time.

It felt like a ritual.

A final goodbye to three years of being a doormat.

I didn’t have much.

Everything I cared about fit into one bag.

Finally, I reached into the back of the nightstand and pulled out a leather folder.

The deed to the house.

Only my name was on it.

The one bit of leverage my parents made sure I had.

I tucked it into my jacket pocket.

Zipped the suitcase shut.

I stood up and took one last look around.

I chose those curtains. I picked those sheets.

Our wedding photo was still staring back at me from the wall.

Ronan looked so “tender” in that shot.

And I looked so “happy.”

What a joke!

I walked over, ripped the frame off the wall.

And slammed it onto the floor.

The glass shattered into a million pieces.

That was the most satisfying sound I’d heard in this house in three years!

I grabbed my bag and walked out.

I didn’t look back.

My phone buzzed.

It was Sal.

“Genevieve, I’m downstairs. I’ve got two serious buyers with me. Both all-cash, ready to close.”

When you come to study in Melbourne, choosing the right place of residence almost determines the happiness of your future years of study abroad. Melbourne has been crowned the ""World's Most Livable City"" for many consecutive years. This is not only due to its top-notch educational resources, but also because of its unique community culture - each suburb has a distinct character. As someone who has studied and lived in Melbourne, I am well aware of the dilemma people face when looking for a place to live: want it to be close to campuses, but also worried about the high rent; want a convenient life, but also afraid of the environment being too noisy.

Today, I will take you on a deep tour of the five core areas in Melbourne that are most popular among international students. From transportation, living facilities, rental levels to the real living atmosphere, I will help you find the place that is most like ""home"".

# Overview of Renting in Melbourne: A Balance between Livability & Budget

The urban layout of Melbourne is centered on the CBD and radiates outward. Generally, residential areas are classified into: City (the CBD), Inner Suburbs (the near Suburbs, usually within 5 kilometers of the CBD), and Middle/Outer Suburbs (the middle and far suburbs).

For students who have just arrived in Melbourne, it is crucial to understand the overall market situation of [Melbourne student accommodation](https://en.uhomes.com/au/melbourne). The rental market in Melbourne remains at a high level this year, especially in the areas near the University of Melbourne (UniMelb) and RMIT. The rent for a Studio (one-bedroom suite) in the CBD usually ranges from AU$550 to AU$850 per week. However, if you choose Box Hill in the East or Footscray in the West, you may have more flexible price options. Many students use Melbourne student housing platforms such as [uhomes.com](http://uhomes.com) to compare options across different areas, which aggregates apartments in the CBD, inner suburbs, and popular student areas, making it easier to get a quick overview of prices and room types.

The transportation in Melbourne mainly relies on trains, trams and buses. If you live in the city or its suburbs, the tram is the most commonly used means of transportation. If you live in a slightly farther area, the punctuality and speed of the train will be more guaranteed.

# Best Living Areas in Melbourne for International Students

# Melbourne CBD

If you are in pursuit of an extremely fast-paced life or are a student of RMIT or Monash University's City campus, living in the CBD can truly allow you to experience ""the world as soon as you step out"".

* **Average Rent:** Student Accommodation: AU$500 - AU$750 per week; Shared House: AU$350 - AU$480 per week per room.
* **Security:** Medium. The crime rate statistics here seem to be on the high side, mainly due to the large number of people, which leads to a higher incidence of petty theft. As it is a city that never sleeps 24 hours a day and is brightly lit, as long as you don't go to the secluded back alleys, the perceived safety level is still acceptable.
* **Commuting & Entertainment:** Right at your doorstep. It takes only 5 to 10 minutes on foot to reach RMIT, and a 10-minute tram ride directly to the University of Melbourne. Queen Victoria Market (QVM) and Emporium Mall are within walking distance.
* **Student Apartments vs. Shared Rentals:** [uhomes.com](http://uhomes.com) student apartments in Melbourne CBD have extremely strict security and offer front desk services for collecting packages, which is very worry-free. Sharing a house usually means living in a private apartment with good facilities, but one needs to handle the water, electricity and gas bills by oneself, and the roommates may have a relatively high turnover rate.

# Carlton

If you are a student of the University of Melbourne, Carlton is definitely your top choice. This place is just across the street from the campus, and you can walk to class.

* **Average Rent:** Student Accommodation: $450 - $650 per week; Shared Rental: AU$300 - AU$450 per week.
* **Safety:** Good. This area is mostly inhabited by students and professors, and it has a strong cultural atmosphere. The only thing to note is that some areas near the Housing Commission are relatively quiet at night. It is recommended to travel in groups.
* **Commuting & Entertainment:** It only takes 5 to 15 minutes to walk to the University of Melbourne from student accommodation of uhomes.com. Lygon Street (Italian Street) gathers the most authentic coffee shops and Italian restaurants in all of Mexico, brimming with the vitality of daily life.
* **Student Apartments vs. Shared Rentals:** Many of the shared rentals in Carlton Melbourn are old detached houses with a distinct Australian style, but they might be rather cold in winter. Student apartments offer more modern heating facilities and study rooms.

# Southbank

Southbank is located on the south side of the CBD and is a new type of community with numerous skyscrapers. It is very popular among international students who pursue a high quality of life.

* **Average Rent:** Student Accommodation: AU$480 - AU$700 per week; Shared House: AU$380 - AU$500 per week per room.
* **Safety:** Excellent. This is the famous art district in Melbourne, with complete security facilities and wide, clean streets.
* **Commuting & Entertainment:** You can enter the CBD by walking across the Southbank Footbridge. It takes about 20 minutes by tram to get to the University of Melbourne. Here, you can find the Crown Casino, an art center and top-notch river-view restaurants. It's a great place to relax on weekends.
* **Student Apartments vs. Shared Rentals:** Student accommodation in Southbank are usually more spacious than those in the CBD. The student apartment has a strong social atmosphere. Private shared houses/apartments often come with free swimming pools and saunas, providing a living experience that is more like a vacation.

# Footscray

If you are studying at the University of Victoria (VU) or in the CBD but have a limited budget, Footscray is an underestimated ""treasure"".

* **Average Rent:** Student Accommodation: AU$350 - AU$500 per week; Shared Houses: AU$220 - AU$320 per week per room.
* **Security:** Average, but improving. It used to have an average reputation, but in recent years, with a large number of international students and artists moving in, the community has become very vibrant. It is recommended to take the main road late at night.
* **Commuting & Entertainment:** It only takes 2 to 3 train stops (about 10 to 15 minutes) to reach the CBD directly. Here is the famous Footscray Market, where the prices of fruits and vegetables are the lowest in the whole city.
* **Student Apartments vs. Shared Rentals:** Student apartments are usually newer and have advanced facilities. Sharing a room is highly cost-effective. Many students can rent very spacious single rooms here.

# Box Hill

Box Hill is the area with the largest number of Asians in the entire city of Melbourne.

* **Average Rent:** Student Accommodation: AU$380 - AU$550 per week; Shared Houses: $250 - $380 per week per room.
* **Safety:** Good. In mature family residential communities, there is a strong sense of mutual assistance among neighbors.
* **Commuting & Entertainment:** It is about a 30 to 40-minute train ride from the CBD. The transportation hub is right downstairs of Box Hill Central shopping mall. Here, you can find the most comprehensive collection of Asian restaurants and Chinese supermarkets in all of Melbourne, making life very convenient.
* **Student Apartments vs. Shared Rentals:** There are a wide variety of shared rental options here, including a large number of modern apartments and single-family houses. Some student apartments usually offer multilingual services, ranging from English to Chinese.

# Conclusion

The most charming aspect of Melbourne lies in its inclusiveness. No matter which area you plan to settle down in, what kind of study abroad life you long for, or how much budget you have, you can always find your own place here. I hope this guide can offer you some practical help to start this wonderful journey.",1,1769930586.0,u_Choice-Unit1277,0,1.0,False

(it was peaceful, but traumatic for roommate and somehow she made it worse for me)

Backstory because I feel context may be important:

So I (30nb) moved in with my mother (50ish f) on my 18th birthday, to escape the abuse from my father. She had previously been in a relationship with my father, left him and married my stepfather, then left him after his abuse got too much to handle. Both my stepfather and likely father had NPD- mom liked them because they told her what she wanted to hear- that she was safe, she could trust him, all that BS that they say in public... and I feel there's a reason she was attracted to them, but I'm not a doctor and only going to assume she may have something similar as well, or just picked up their communication methods over the years because they would isolate her- make excuses to her friends why she couldn't go to their spinning class, or whatever the hobby of the year was, etc., causing them to lose contact with her. She then lived alone, then dated a crackhead, then someone who just treated her as a merital aid (he was married, but his wife was ok with it, we went over for fire-spinning sometimes, fun times), so... she hasn't had a good example of ""how to communicate like a normal and decent human being"". That's the only way I could POSSIBLY explain her... well, abuse.

The first few years (3-ish maybe) was rough- I had to get signed up for a lot, then get on food stamps so I'm not eating hers (I lived on raman packets by the case for a good year or... I don't remember exactly how long actually). But it got better, taking care of the dog and cat, vacuuming the upstairs and the stairs themselves (painful with a tendon disorder, but I'll actually do it, unlike her- you do NOT want to know how bad it was when I moved in at first).



She was generally fine for... well, quite a while... until I asked for my desk back. See, I had fixed up her laptop so she could use it, and since I had just bought a replacement desk that has enough space for my desktop computer I offered to let her borrow my old desk so she had somewhere to sit and use the laptop... which she never did. That damn laptop got used like twice to constantly stream a fireplace video, but not even sat on the desk- instead, all of her stuff got dumped on it, and it sat there for... months, idk how long exactly. Then when chatting to her about something, probably the cat or dog or shopping (her only passions in life besides cannabis and complaining about her medical stuff), I saw that she had used nail polish or a paint pen and painted crap on my desk- pink hearts and stripes over a corner, when she knew I had only lent it to her.

Naturally, I asked for it back since she hadn't been using it for the one reason I had lent it to her, AND because she painted part of it (it's black metal, the marking were pink and obvious). She eventually gave in and gave it back... but not without the self-destructive ""well I want back everything I've ever let you have or borrow"" in more words, of course, which I happily obliged because obviously I would, they were lent and she was in a destructive mood- if I say or do the wrong thing, suddenly I'm the asshole.

That's where it began, or at least when I started forwarding and screenshotting her... nonsense, to a private telegram channel (platform where I convinced here to communicate to me through since I wasn't having anything to do with Meta and it's property anymore). No you can't access it, because it's uncensored, even though the lazy in me wanted to at first.

Then there's the time I was making coffee- we both have heart issues (mine's more ""watch your caffiene and heart rate"", hers is basically the same but she's been seeing a doctor about it, like I am now), so i had been using a blend of regular and decaf- specifically, a 50/50 blend of two roasts of regular, then mixing that with decaf- the ratios and instructions I wrote on the giant white lid with a black wax pen, on the glass jar we stored the coffee ground mix in, had been following it for YEARS and had even shown her how I do it, even having her do it a few times, then ONE DAY she watches me, and go ""WHAT THE FUCK? ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ME???"" and now I can't have fresh-brewed coffee and she doesn't understand what she did wrong or why I don't like anything but bottled coffee anymore.

Oh and that's ignoring the dead cat that was in the freezer next to my icecream for MONTHS, the time she bought me a $37 vape because I had asked what she used once, then asked me to pay for it DAYS after just handing it over without saying anything, as if it were a gift (neither of us are employed, her by choice), uhhh what else... her mantras when she realizes she fucked up but can't accept responsibility are ""you're purposefully misunderstanding me"", ""I said that but"", ""you're too sensitive"", ""you always make this about you"", and so on, always flipping it on me when SHE'S the one who did the dumb shit of the day. Oh, and her not only using her friends as tools (and losing all of them), but her also getting any friend of mine she sees has a car to do stuff for her, or asks me to ask them.... when no, my friends are FRIENDS, not a fucking TAXI- she doesn't even offer to pay for gas, even when she called my BEST FRIEND to COME DOWN ON HER BIRTHDAY TO HELP US MOVE OUR DEAD DOG. Yeah, I know, what the fuck, it's real I swear, she's put together a gift basket this year after I heavily implied she needs to make up for that this year. I WISH I was making this shit up. And yeah me and my bestie don't talk much anymore.

I could go on, and I will... but uh, I'm tired and completely worn out from the stress of both dealing with her today (another post, another subreddit, another day, too tired), and I have no idea if my life is too dumb to be believable. I like my dreams better than reality most days- endless empty cities to explore and float through, no drama, no blaming me when they can't communicate properly, no need for memories... ugh. Hope this wasn't too hard to read, in many senses, I'll catch up with y'all in the morning to answer any questions.",4,1769929949.0,badroommates,1,1.0,False

1qsrll3,https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/1qsrll3/tribble_pov/,Tribble POV,"I've got an interesting film idea, set in Star Trek: The Original Series. Everyone knows the Enterprise's daily adventures, work, and challenges.

However, I'd like to create a fun little slice-of-life story, a day in the life of Tribble. The film won't show the crew's faces, only their voices and body parts (Restricted Frames). It's a silent, sci-fi slice-of-life narrative told from the perspective of a non-verbal creature.

The story begins:

(Tribble is in the captain's seat on Bridge, and Kirk accidentally sits on it.)

Tribble: Squeak!

Kirk: Oh, sorry, little guy.

(Kirk picks up Tribble and puts it on the ground. Tribble begins exploring at a speed of 0.05 m/s.)

(It passes by Spock's boots.)

Spock (at the control panel): Captain, energy output is stable, but efficiency can be increased by 3.4%.

Chekov/Sulu (Control Console): Course correction 0.02 degrees.

Uhura (Communication Station): ...This is Starfleet, signal reception is good.

(Some time later, Tribble arrives at Engineering and lies on a screwdriver.)

Scotty (crouching down to adjust the piping): These bolts are always loose!

(Scotty reaches for a screwdriver but pinches Tribble.)

Scotty: What the…

Tribble: Purr…

(Scotty picks up Tribble and puts it in the hallway outside. Tribble moves, passing Sickbay; the scene only shows McCoy's feet walking back and forth.)

McCoy: The medical room always busy…

(Tribble crawls into the ventilation duct and arrives at Mess Hall. The others are eating when suddenly an alarm sounds: an emergency alert for a small meteorite.)

(The crew instantly drop their plates, bowls, and coffee cups, rushing to their workstations. Dishes clatter on the floor, and anxious whispers mingle with hurried footsteps. Kirk walks quickly to the communications station, while McCoy and the other crew members disappear into the depths of the corridor.)

(To Tribble) For it, this was just a strange combination of light and sound; the concept of ""crisis"" didn't exist in its dictionary—only ""eat,"" ""climb,"" and ""smell."" It climbed onto the table in the opposite direction, its eyes gleaming, and began voraciously devouring the remaining food. As it ate, a large swarm of small Tribble multiplied, their furry forms rolling and piling up on the table, spreading like snowflakes. Their world consisted only of ""more food, a more comfortable floor.""

(The alarm is off, the lights return to normal. The crew returns to Mess Hall, relieved that the crisis is over, but are astonished to see the table piled high with furry little creatures.)

Scotty opens the door to Mess Hall, hands over his head, watching a swarm of Tribble roll out.


Scotty: ""Oh, come on…""

Kirk: ""My chicken sandwich and coffee…""

Uhura: There could be thousands

Sulu: There could be tens of thousands

Spock: 161,051…, This is assuming that during the 2.5 hours we were away, with ample food, the Tribble… Ten babies are born every 0.5 hours…

Kirk: …Deal with these Tribbles first.

McCoy (complaining): I'm a doctor, not a zookeeper!

Scotty: Should we teleport them to the Klingon's ship?

Chekhov: Hehehehe…

Tribble: purr…coo…

1qsrhi7,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeStyleGuru/comments/1qsrhi7/best_moisturizer_with_niacinamide/,Best Moisturizer with Niacinamide,"My bathroom cabinet tells an embarrassing story.

Four half-empty bottles of `niacinamide` serums. Three moisturizers claiming ""barrier repair"" in cheerful fonts. Two toners I bought because TikTok told me to. And one very confused skin barrier that looked worse than when I started this whole mess.

The problem? Everyone preaches about `niacinamide` like it's skincare gospel, but nobody explains *which concentration actually works*, what texture won't pill under sunscreen, or whether spending $75 instead of $15 makes any measurable difference.

So I tested them. Eight different niacinamide moisturizers over four months, using one side of my face for the drugstore option and the other for the luxury pick. Because if I'm going to have uneven skin, it might as well be in the name of science.

Here's what actually happened.

# Why Niacinamide in a Moisturizer (Not a Serum)

Look, serums are fine. But moisturizers with `niacinamide` built in solve a problem nobody talks about: *layering fatigue*.

You know that moment when you've applied cleanser, toner, serum, eye cream, moisturizer, and you're supposed to add sunscreen but your face feels like a glazed donut and nothing's actually sinking in? And then your makeup pills within 20 minutes because you've got seven layers of product fighting for real estate on your pores?

A good niacinamide moisturizer consolidates. One step instead of two. Less pilling, less time, less chance you'll skip it entirely because you're running late and your coffee's getting cold.

The science backs this up, too. Research from late 2024 shows that `niacinamide` concentrations between 2-5% deliver the same barrier-strengthening and sebum-regulating benefits as higher concentrations, just with way less irritation potential. And when it's suspended in a moisturizing base with `ceramides` and `hyaluronic acid`, the delivery is actually *better* than standalone serums that can sometimes sting or flush sensitive skin.

So yeah. Moisturizers win.

# The Concentration Sweet Spot Nobody Mentions

Here's what dermatologists know but brands conveniently ignore: **more niacinamide isn't always better**.

The skincare industry *loves* playing the percentage game. 10% niacinamide! 12% niacinamide! Why not 20% and really torch your skin barrier while we're at it?

But clinical studies from 2024-2025 consistently show that 2-5% `niacinamide` is the sweet spot. That's the concentration that:

* Strengthens the skin barrier by boosting `ceramide` production
* Regulates sebum output by up to 30% (huge for oily skin)
* Fades hyperpigmentation without irritation
* Reduces inflammation markers associated with acne and rosacea

Anything above 5-6% doesn't deliver proportionally better results. What it *does* deliver is a higher chance of that weird flushing sensation some people get with niacinamide, plus potential for dryness if your skin's already compromised.

And yet brands keep pushing 10% formulations because ""10 sounds better than 4"" on a label. Marketing working overtime while your skin pays the price.

The exception? If you have extremely resilient skin and you've been using 2-3% niacinamide for months without issue, bumping to 5% might give you a slight edge on dark spots and pore appearance. *Might*. But 10%+ is performance theater, not dermatology.

# The Real Winner (Spoiler: It's $12)

**CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion** is the product that made me realize I'd been overthinking this entire category.

|Spec|Details|
|:-|:-|
|`Niacinamide` **Concentration**|\~4% (not listed, but confirmed by ingredient analysis)|
|**Key Ingredients**|`Ceramide NP`, `Ceramide AP`, `Ceramide EOP`, `Hyaluronic Acid`|
|**Texture**|Lightweight cream-gel hybrid|
|**Price per oz**|\~$4-5 (3 oz bottle runs $12-14)|
|**Best for**|All skin types, especially barrier-compromised|
|**Absorbs in**|60-90 seconds|

The texture surprised me most. It's not a gel and it's not a cream – it's this weird cream-gel limbo that feels cool and slippery when you apply it, then just *vanishes* into your skin within a minute. No residue. No pilling under sunscreen. No greasy film making you look like you dunked your face in olive oil.

And the results? After three weeks of nightly use, my skin looked calmer. Those angry red patches around my nose from over-exfoliating? Gone by day 12. The dry, flaky texture I'd been battling all winter? Smooth by week two.

But here's the thing nobody tells you: **CeraVe PM isn't sexy**.

The bottle's boring. The marketing's clinical. There's no Instagram-worthy unboxing moment. You can't brag about discovering some obscure French pharmacy gem that costs $89 and comes in a frosted glass bottle with a dropper that makes you *feel* like you're doing something transformative.

You're just... using CeraVe. Like your dermatologist suggested five years ago before you decided to ignore them and try 47 other products first.

# The Luxury Alternative That's Actually Worth It

**Olay Regenerist Niacinamide + Peptide 24 Face Moisturizer** sits in this interesting middle ground where it's not drugstore cheap, but it's nowhere near luxury pricing either.

|Spec|Details|
|:-|:-|
|`Niacinamide` **Concentration**|99% pure (Olay's marketing claim) at \~3-5% in formula|
|**Key Ingredients**|`Niacinamide`, Peptide Complex, `Hyaluronic Acid`|
|**Texture**|Richer cream, absorbs slower|
|**Price per oz**|\~$10-12 (1.7 oz runs $20-25)|
|**Best for**|Mature skin, anti-aging focus|
|**Absorbs in**|2-3 minutes|

The peptides are the differentiator here. While `niacinamide` handles barrier repair and tone evening, the peptide complex (palmitoyl pentapeptide-4 and friends) signals your skin to boost collagen production. Does it work as well as retinol? No. But for people whose skin freaks out at the mere *thought* of retinoids, this combo delivers visible firmness improvements over 8-12 weeks.

The texture's thicker than CeraVe PM. Takes longer to sink in. If you have oily skin or you're trying to layer this under makeup at 7 AM, you might find it annoying. But for nighttime use, especially if your skin's on the drier side or you're dealing with early aging concerns, it's solid.

One caveat: Olay formulations have fragrance. Not a ton, but enough that if you're fragrance-sensitive or dealing with active rosacea, this might irritate you. CeraVe PM is fragrance-free, which is why it wins for sensitivity cases.

# The Price-Performance Breakdown

Let me show you what you're *actually* paying for when you move up the price ladder:

|Product|Price/oz|`Niacinamide` %|`Ceramides`|Fragrance-Free|Performance Score\*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|

\*Performance score based on: concentration effectiveness, complementary ingredients, texture, real-world usability

The Ordinary gets a low score not because the `niacinamide` is bad – it's perfectly fine – but because the serum texture is notoriously sticky and pills under other products. Reddit's r/SkincareAddiction has entire threads dedicated to people trying to make TO Niacinamide work in their routines and eventually giving up because it won't layer properly.

And Paula's Choice? The 10% concentration is overkill for most people, and you're paying $46 for a product that doesn't include barrier-supporting ingredients like `ceramides` or `hyaluronic acid`. It's `niacinamide` in isolation, which means you *still* need a separate moisturizer. Defeats the whole purpose.

# What Actually Happened in My Split-Face Test

Left side: **CeraVe PM** ($12)  
Right side: **Olay Regenerist** ($24)

Both used nightly for 12 weeks. Same cleanser, same sunscreen, no other variables changed.

**Week 4 results:**

* Both sides showed reduced redness
* CeraVe side felt more hydrated (those `ceramides` working overtime)
* Olay side had slightly smoother texture (peptides kicking in)

**Week 8 results:**

* CeraVe side: One persistent dark spot from an old breakout faded by maybe 20%
* Olay side: Same dark spot faded by maybe 25-30%
* Both sides: Significantly calmer, less reactive to weather changes

**Week 12 results:**

* No visible difference between the two sides
* Both looked healthier, more even-toned, less irritated
* The Olay side *might* have been slightly firmer around my smile lines, but that could be wishful thinking

So the $12 difference bought me... possibly 5-10% better results on dark spots and maybe some firming I can't definitively measure.

For someone in their late 30s or 40s specifically targeting aging concerns? Olay Regenerist might be worth the extra spend.

For everyone else? CeraVe PM delivers 90% of the same results for half the price. The math isn't mathing on the luxury option.

# For Different Skin Types: What Works

**Oily/Acne-Prone Skin:**

Go lightweight or go home. Heavy creams will make you look like a grease slick by noon.

Best pick: **CeraVe PM** or **La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair**

Both have gel-cream textures that sink in fast without leaving residue. The `niacinamide` helps regulate sebum production, which means less oil *and* better hydration. Your skin stops overproducing oil when it's properly moisturized – that's the part the ""skip moisturizer for oily skin"" crowd doesn't understand.

**Dry/Dehydrated Skin:**

You need `ceramides` and humectants working together. `Niacinamide` alone won't cut it.

Best pick: **CeraVe PM** (notice a theme?) or **Olay Regenerist** for extra richness

The triple-`ceramide` complex in CeraVe is genuinely game-changing for dry skin. It doesn't just sit on the surface – it actually helps rebuild your skin's barrier so it can hold onto moisture better long-term.

If CeraVe PM isn't enough, layer it over a `hyaluronic acid` serum or under a sleeping pack at night. But start with CeraVe as your base.

**Sensitive/Reactive Skin:**

Fragrance-free. Non-comedogenic. Minimal ingredient list. No negotiation.

Best pick: **CeraVe PM** (again) or **La Roche-Posay Toleriane**

Both are dermatologist-tested and formulated specifically for sensitive skin. No essential oils. No added fragrance. No ""natural"" extracts that might sound nice but trigger inflammation.

La Roche-Posay adds prebiotic ingredients to support your skin microbiome, which some people swear helps with redness. Worth trying if CeraVe isn't cutting it.

**Mature/Aging Skin:**

You want `niacinamide` *plus* something that addresses collagen loss.

Best pick: **Olay Regenerist** with peptides, or **CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream** (has retinol + niacinamide)

The peptides in Olay Regenerist provide gentle anti-aging support without the irritation of retinoids. But if your skin tolerates retinol well, the CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream combines `niacinamide` with encapsulated retinol for dual-action aging defense.

Fair warning: retinol + niacinamide can be sensitizing for some people. Start 2-3x per week and work up to nightly use.

# The Ingredients That Actually Matter

Beyond `niacinamide`, here's what separates a good moisturizer from expensive fluff:

`Ceramides` **(NP, AP, EOP):**  
These are lipids that make up 50% of your skin barrier. When they're depleted, your skin can't hold moisture and gets irritated easily. Topical `ceramides` help rebuild that barrier from the outside in.

CeraVe includes all three essential ceramides. Most competitors skip them to save on formulation costs.

`Hyaluronic Acid` **(Sodium Hyaluronate):**  
Holds 1000x its weight in water. Pulls moisture from the environment into your skin. Works best when applied to damp skin and sealed with an occlusive layer.

Every product on this list includes it. It's baseline at this point.

**Peptides (Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, etc.):**  
Signal your skin to produce more collagen. Results are subtle and take 8-12 weeks minimum. Won't compete with prescription retinoids, but won't irritate you either.

Only worth paying extra for if you're specifically targeting aging concerns.

**What You DON'T Need:**

* Essential oils (fragrance = irritation for many people)
* 10+ ""botanical extracts"" (more ingredients = more potential allergens)
* Proprietary ""miracle"" complexes with trademarked names (marketing, not science)

# How to Actually Use It (Because Instructions Matter)

**Application order:**

1. Cleanse
2. Actives if using (retinol, AHAs, vitamin C)
3. Wait 10-15 minutes if you used low-pH actives
4. Apply niacinamide moisturizer to damp skin
5. Seal with sunscreen (AM) or sleeping pack (PM)

That waiting period after actives? Critical. `Niacinamide` is pH-dependent. If you slap it on immediately after a pH 3 glycolic acid toner, the conflicting pH levels can cause flushing or reduced effectiveness.

I ignored this for *months* and wondered why my CeraVe PM kept making my face red. Turns out the issue wasn't the product – it was my impatient application timing.

**Amount:**  
You need less than you think. A pea-sized amount covers your entire face if you warm it between your hands first and press it in rather than rubbing. More product doesn't equal better results. It just means pilling and waste.

**Frequency:**  
Twice daily unless your skin tells you otherwise. `Niacinamide` is gentle enough for morning and night use. If you're introducing it for the first time, start with once daily (PM) for the first week, then increase.

Some people genuinely don't tolerate niacinamide well and get persistent flushing or breakouts. If that's you, skip it. No ingredient is universal, and the internet's obsession with `niacinamide` doesn't mean it's mandatory for good skin.

# The Verdict: What to Buy Right Now

If you're reading this in early 2026 and you just want the straight answer:

**Buy CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion.**

It's $12. It works. It's been working since 2010 and it'll still work in 2030. The formula hasn't changed (except removing parabens in 2020 for marketing reasons, even though parabens are perfectly safe and actually better preservatives than the alternatives, but that's a rant for another day).

You can find it at Target, CVS, Walgreens, Amazon. It's boring. It's reliable. It's the Honda Civic of skincare, and sometimes that's exactly what you need instead of chasing the next TikTok viral product that'll be forgotten in three months.

If your skin is mature and you want the peptide boost, spend the extra $12 on **Olay Regenerist**. It's a solid upgrade for specific concerns.

If you have money to burn and you want the French pharmacy aesthetic, **La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair** is excellent and includes prebiotics for microbiome support.

But honestly? CeraVe PM is the answer 8 times out of 10. I wish I'd figured that out before buying four different `niacinamide` serums I never finished.

# Quick FAQ

**Can I use niacinamide with vitamin C?**  
Yes. That myth about them canceling each other out is outdated science from the 1960s. Modern formulations are stable together. Layer your vitamin C first, wait a few minutes, then apply niacinamide moisturizer.

**Will niacinamide fade my dark spots?**  
Gradually, yes. Expect 4-8 weeks of consistent use before you see measurable fading. It works by inhibiting melanosome transfer, not bleaching skin, so results are subtle but cumulative.

**Can I use retinol and niacinamide together?**  
Absolutely. `Niacinamide` actually helps buffer retinol irritation. Many dermatologists recommend using them together for that reason. Just give your retinol 10-15 minutes to absorb before applying the niacinamide moisturizer.

**Is 10% niacinamide better than 4%?**  
No. Studies show 2-5% delivers the same benefits with less irritation risk. Brands use high percentages for marketing, not because they're more effective.

**Why does niacinamide make my face red?**  
Could be three things: 1) You're using it too soon after acidic products (pH clash), 2) The concentration is too high for your skin, or 3) You have a genuine niacinamide sensitivity (rare but possible). Try spacing out your products and using a lower concentration first.

**Do I still need a separate moisturizer if I use a niacinamide serum?**  
Yes, unless the serum is specifically formulated as a moisturizer (rare). Most `niacinamide` serums are water-based and don't provide enough occlusion to prevent moisture loss. Layer a moisturizer over your serum for best results.

# The Real Secret

The secret to good skin isn't buying the most expensive product or using the trendiest ingredient.

It's finding something that *works for your specific skin*, that you'll actually use consistently, and that doesn't make you broke or require a PhD in cosmetic chemistry to understand.

For most people, that thing is a $12 bottle of CeraVe PM.

Not sexy. Not Instagram-worthy. But effective.

And honestly? After four months of testing, comparing, photographing, and analyzing, I'm okay with boring if it means my skin looks calm, hydrated, and even-toned.

Your skin doesn't care about luxury packaging. It cares about `ceramides`, hydration, and barrier support. Give it those things in whatever bottle makes sense for your budget, and you'll be fine.

***Prologue - Widening Gyre***

*With tongue of Fool's Gold she makes promises*

*Through Brazen teeth and lips of quicksilver…* 

* From ‘Greed’ by Member In Charge

His chest felt like it would explode from the relentless onslaught of the wrecking ball within, determined to raze its way through. His knees suddenly felt weak. Before his teary eyes, the typed letters congealed into a stringy, black mass of decay as if the 15-inch screen at which he stared was rotting from its center. He had just opened his laptop and the words, “I loved having you in my bed last night…” were forever emblazoned in the depths of his psyche. He wasn’t the author of these raunchy messages. No, this was some bozo talking to his wife. 

Over the last few months, he had noticed a familiar hostility from her that reminded him of past experiences, only now remembered, her attitude toward him growing more and more frigid by the day. He felt a nagging suspicion that her family had turned her against him. Sure, he had made more than his fair share of mistakes in recent memory, and money was often found wanting in his pocket. However, he felt there was something more to this intensifying ire, and was determined to get to the bottom of it. What did he resort to? Hacking his wife’s phone. Just hours ago, he had paired his wife’s WhatsApp with his laptop using WhatsApp Web, and now he could see all of her incoming and outgoing messages on his browser.

Believe it or not, even though this wasn’t the first time this had happened, he had not expected to find out that Joy was, in fact, cheating on him with her father’s tenant. To say that the world had crashed around him would not even come close to encapsulating the depths of his pain. In that one moment, Emmanuel, as the world knew him, was gone.

The years seemed to fold back on themselves like pages of a book blown by the wind, and suddenly, Emmanuel found himself back at his in-laws’ house, where they lived in the earlier years of their marriage. It had been a sunny day, but the brightness could not quite penetrate the gloom he had been wrapped in. For the last two weeks, it had been fight after fight over money, or rather the lack thereof. The intensity of the arguments reached baffling heights, increasing with each encounter. 

*But why?* Emmanuel thought, shaking his head. *Can’t she see that I’m fighting with everything I’ve got? We don’t have money, but surely she can’t just write my current situation off as permanent.*

As he replayed last night’s skirmish over and over in his head he couldn’t help but descend further into confusion as images of her berating him in short, devastating utterances punctuated by such confessions as, “I feel like such a failure,” and, “I’ve failed my family!” Even more baffling was her response to his reassuring words. 

“Joy, you haven’t failed anyone. As far as I can tell, you haven’t given up. As long as you keep fighting, how can you say that you’ve failed?” “You don’t know what I’m going through. Everything is on me, and I’m not getting any help from you.” “Joy, how can you say that? We started this business together. When we saw that the business needed time to grow, we both agreed that I would step aside from the business and find other ways to raise money for family expenses so that the business has a chance to bounce back. How can you say that you’re not getting any help from me?” “We still owe Gift's school fees. How is that helping me?” *You seem to have forgotten the portion that I did pay.* 

For some reason, he couldn’t bring himself to say that last bit out loud. Instead, he just kept quiet as he seethed inside, spiraling in despair. He looked at her face through the veil of tears that seemed to insulate her from reality. Or was it the other way around? *Am I missing the plot somewhere?* 

Now, as he sits alone in the bedroom they shared, Emmanuel is wrapped up in this internal rant. The door opens, and Joy appears with a somber expression on her face. “Manu, can we talk?” Her expression did not betray any hostility on her part. She looked almost humble, for lack of a better word. It was also not lost on him that this was the first time she had used this nickname for him in months. *An olive branch, perhaps?* “Okay. Let’s talk.” “Could we take a walk outside while we talk?” 

A spark of hope immediately lit up his face. Could this be a romantic gesture? *Does she want to drop the fighting and just be happy with me?* Emmanuel was already flying high at the thought. As he followed her out the door, he took the initiative to hold her hand as they walked, trying to signal to her that he was fully on board with this turn of events. 

They slowly walked around the lush garden in silence for a few moments. Joy’s expression remained somber, troubled, almost. Emmanuel was thinking of how to break the ice when Joy spoke up. “I have something I need to confess to you. Could we sit down here?” She gestured toward an avocado root that had, years before that moment, jutted out of the ground, traveled almost a meter, then took a nosedive back into the depths of the earth. Manu sat down first, then she took her spot next to him. 

Another moment of silence ensued as she fiddled with her rainbow-colored dress that hugged her curves in a way that always drew Manu’s attention to her very attractive body. Her lower lip began to quiver slightly before finally launching into her speech. 

“Manu, I did something terrible. Working so closely with Joshua, we formed a friendship. I started sharing with him my frustrations about the situation with the business and how I had put all my hopes into it for the sake of our livelihood. He also shared details about his life and the troubles he had with his marriage. One thing led to another, and I had sex with him.” 

At that moment, Manu froze. It had quickly registered in his mind what she had just said, but he sat there and waited for the wave of rage, resentment, devastation, sadness, shock, and all the other emotions he couldn’t think of at that moment to wash over him, overwhelming him. It didn’t come. 

In that moment of silence, Joy rushed to say, “I’m so sorry! I regret having ever done it. I will understand if you never want to have anything to do with me now.” 

Manu started to rock back and forth as he looked blankly at the eastern horizon, conscious of the reddening sun behind him. His gaze veered off to the left and noticed for the first time in the two years that he lived there, a cactus fruit plant beginning to flower. 

Joshua was known to Emmanuel from the time he was 15 years old. They saw each other at annual church gatherings as members of local music departments in different cities. He had gotten involved with the couple’s business as a friend and investor who wanted to help them bring their snack manufacturing business from the brink of bankruptcy after a series of unfortunate miscalculations. 

Because of their shared experience in church and passion for worship through song, Manu regarded Josh as a trusted friend, and even a mentor. He had never expected him to make a move on his wife, much less have sex with her. ‘*I guess the joke’s on me.’*

“Manu, please say something.” “How long has this been going on?” His tone was flat, his blank gaze set straight ahead. “Two weeks… more like 10 days. I put an end to it a few weeks ago. I couldn’t bring myself to hide it from you. You don’t deserve any of this. Josh tried to convince me not to tell you, but I could not do it. I love you.”

“Where did you do it?” “It happened 3 times. It was in the car after everyone else had left.” Manu didn’t even know why he asked that question. He didn’t want to know the sordid details. Now he had to deal with the image of the two of them in the back seat of the car he used to go to the store, do the school run… go to church. *Where the hell is my reaction?*

“Manu, I’m sorry. It was the biggest mistake I’ve ever made. We were going through some hard times, and there was Josh offering an ear to listen and a shoulder to cry on. I couldn’t control the situation...” A dull thud reverberated briefly as Manu’s fist made contact with the tree root they were sitting on. “Joy, don’t sit there and act like you didn’t have a choice. You always have a choice. You chose to get in that car and do whatever it was that you did. It’s on you.”

Another brief moment was spent in silence. Finally, Emmanuel asked, “What do you want to do now?” “Could you find it in you to give me another chance?” More silence. 

*Come on, man, where’s my rage? She shouts at me for the most trivial things. She goes ballistic over the power going out. Here she hooks up with Josh, and what? Nothing. What the hell, Manu!* “I need a few minutes on my own. I’m going to the bedroom.” Joy’s gaze lowered to the ground as she gave a slow nod. 

As Manu sat at the foot of the bed, he agonized over his response (or rather, the lack thereof) to Joy’s revelation. *Cry! Scream! Laugh! SOMETHING!* He waited. Silence. *Just forgive her. You have two kids with her. Just forgive her. Keep the secret. She won’t do this again.* 

“Joy!” He called out into the darkening hallway. After a moment’s pause, Joy came to the door. He gestured for her to sit on the bed. She absentmindedly bit her lower lip as she sat down next to him with her head bowed down. Instead of looking him in the eye, she looked at him sidelong.  

“I forgive you.” Her expression remained somber, although her eyes did light up. “Thank you so much. I promise never to let you down or break your trust…” Her voice trailed off as if she were hesitating to say something. “Manu, I will stay here at home. I won’t go anywhere. I’ll always be here at home so you know what I’m doing all the time…” “No. I’m your husband, not a cop. I can’t be policing you day and night.”

“Thank you, Manu. It sounds strange, but you saying that makes me feel closer to you.” “You gave away what’s mine. NEVER do that again. Do you understand? We are going to keep this between us. No one is going to know.” “Thank you, Babe. I’m sorry. I promise I won’t do it again. I’ve cut off all ties with Josh.” “Don’t ever mention that name to me again.” Manu’s face twisted in a scowl at the thought of the person whom he had just discovered was not his friend. 

“I’m sorry. I won’t mention it again.” She stood up, “I’ll leave you alone now.” Manu quickly stood up behind her, reached over her shoulder, and pushed the door closed. He grabbed her by the arm and turned her around to face him. As he pushed her back against the door, he whispered, “Where are you going with what’s mine?” *This feels all kinds of wrong. Manu, get a grip! Don’t debase yourself. She cheated on you. Don’t do this!* He kissed her deeply. *This is how I’ll forgive her. This is how I’ll reassure her she’s forgiven. This is how I end this nightmare.* He flung her on the bed and made love to her.

Later that night, Emmanuel lay in bed looking up at the ceiling. The hollow sensation he felt in his chest only served as a reminder of the abyss he felt tugging at the pit of his stomach. Had he just torpedoed any chance he had at true happiness? Was he doomed to a life of rage, jealousy, humiliation, grief, and agony all compressed into the singularity now crushing him from within? 

*Time will make this better, Manu. It will all die away with time. Don’t worry so much.* But it wasn’t fair, was it? She gets to scream at him for all his transgressions. And he can’t even bring himself to even suggest he was disappointed in her for any reason? *But she still loves me. I am going to fight for our marriage to work. We’ll come out of this stronger.* This was his last coherent thought before the blissful oblivion of sleep overshadowed him. 

No sooner had the blackness taken over than the break of day jarred him to the waiting reality that was his marriage. *Just love her. If you can just love her, everything will be alright.* His assuring words rang hollow, yet a steel-like resolve set within him. If he could just be that much stronger, hang on that much longer, try that much harder, he could make this the happy marriage he promised Joy before they tied the knot. 

Now, as he reads the racy messages flashing across his laptop’s screen, the image of her lying naked on the bed before him as he rushed to forgive her that day lingered in his mind’s eye, and his heart began to disintegrate to the rhythm of his pounding head. *What the hell? Manu, what the hell were you thinking?*

***Chapter 1 - Turning Tables***

*Where sweaty brow finds rest on barren breast*

* From ‘Greed’ by Member In Charge

As Manu sat in front of his laptop, the reality of Joy’s affair finally solidified. No, there was no way he could be misinterpreting the messages. But what was he to do? Go charging into their bedroom where he knew she was, throw the messages in her face, and demand an explanation? The prospect of a confrontation threw Manu into inexplicable fear. His heart assaulted his chest as though he sat face to face with a pack of hyenas ready to pounce on him, rip his body limb from limb, and devour him, screaming bloody murder. 

*‘Manu, just go in there and confront her. Get it done! Now!’* Despite his internal urge for resolution, Manu sat there frozen, not knowing what to do. As rage built up within him, he found himself pacing all over the open-plan common area of the two-bedroom apartment they lived in. It was as though he thought he might find relief from the weight that seemed to physically crush his heart by looking for it as one would look for his misplaced keys between the sofa cushions. He walked to the opposite sofa and sat down, rocked back and forth, went to the kitchen, turned on the kettle to make some coffee, forgot about the coffee, went to open the fridge… Anything to avoid opening that bedroom door. A tear formed at the corner of his right eye as the shame of his spinelessness washed over him. *‘How can I be this useless? How can I sit here and just take it? Am I really afraid of her?’* He quickly wiped it away as an idea came to him. If he could initiate a seemingly innocuous conversation about household affairs and steer it in such a way that her indiscretions come to light, he would be able to ease into the confrontation without making a scene.

Abandoning the notion of open confrontation, he took his own phone and started messaging his wife. As far as she was concerned, Manu was busy with his freelance work, so a WhatsApp message from him, even though they were in the same apartment, wasn’t unusual.

***Manu:***	***Hey. By the way, how much do we owe Roland?*** 

Roland was the tenant who was living in Joy’s father’s house while he was working abroad. Joy had gotten a loan from Roland to assist Manu, who was out of town frantically trying to sell the produce they had bought in bulk before it all spoiled. In the end, despite all efforts, the produce all went bad and the couple was left with a pile of rotten produce and no small amount of debt. It was to this loan that Manu referred. 

***Joy:***	***Why?*** 

Manu could already sense Joy’s apprehension.

***Manu:***	***I just wanted to see what the balance is. I don’t want to lose track.”***

***Joy:***	***I’ll have to check.***

No sooner had that message come through on Manu’s phone than all messages to and from Roland started disappearing on his laptop screen. ‘*Damn it! Now I have no evidence. Even if I wanted to confront her, I can’t!’* Frustration threatened to consume Manu. He calmed himself down, deciding to bide his time. ‘*Eventually, she will calm down, and I’ll catch her again*. *When that happens, I’ll be ready.’* 

The days went by slowly as Manu did his best to act like everything was normal. Nothing was normal. Every waking moment, Manu’s thoughts were inextricably tethered to his smartphone. Ever since he had almost blown his cover, he decided to move his spying interface to his smartphone so as to evade detection. The messages between Joy and Roland had changed in tone. It became apparent that Joy had decided to be careful about what she said in her messages. A week went by of school runs, failing to concentrate on work, and checking the phone every few minutes. By the time Friday came along, Manu’s mind had begun to unravel and was teetering on the brink of insanity, although he wasn’t sure if he was still on the side of sanity. 

It was a Thursday afternoon. Joy had come home from work early, and they were lying side by side on their bed. Joy was checking messages on her phone, while Manu was wrapping up with a client online. 

“I had an idea. I was talking to my mom yesterday, and she was telling me about how clothes are cheap in Algeria. I did some quick calculations and saw that I could quickly raise money for rent and start paying Roland back without much difficulty by stocking up on clothes and selling them here in Milton Park. It’s quick money, and I think in one trip, I can take care of both before going back and restocking for school fees for the boys.” 

Manu raised a brow and asked, “Even after you take the plane ticket and duty into account?” “Yeah. After everything is said and done, I can spend $6,000 on stock, plane ticket, and duty, and come out with two months’ worth of rent, as well as another $6,000 to do it over again.”

“Okay. But where are we going to get the $6,000 to start?”

“I was thinking of using Mom’s car as security for a loan. I park the car at the loan company’s premises, and they’ll give me the money.”

“Joy, this is a bad idea. Does Mom know that’s what you’re planning?” 

“No. I figure I could do 2 rounds and pay back the loan well within the grace period.”

“Don’t do it. This will backfire. Unless you get Mom onboard with it.” Manu was incredulous. ‘*Are we really having this conversation?’*

“You give me the money, then. Give me the rent money and Roland’s money as well as the school fees that we owe.”

Manu fell silent, stunned at Joy’s response. “If you do this, I will have nothing to do with it. You’re doing this all on your own without my blessing.”

“I slept with someone else to get grocery money.” 

It was as if a beast was inside Manu’s chest, clawing its way out. ‘*Manu, if you have ever been told the truth, this is it.’* Joy took a moment to observe Manu’s reaction. “Do you believe it?” Joy’s challenging tone broke Manu out of his musings. 

“No,” Manu didn’t want to be drawn into the confrontation that he almost knew Joy was trying to draw him into. *‘Does she know that I know what she’s up to?’*

“What makes you so sure?”

“I know you wouldn’t do such a despicable thing.” Inwardly, Manu cringed as he uttered this lie. He knew for a fact that that’s exactly what she had done. Rage, guilt, shame, and humiliation all combined in that instant to form the corrosive compound that was now liquifying his sense of value and manhood from the inside. ‘*For now, I’ve got to take it. Endure for now. Vindication will come eventually.’*

Seeing that there was nothing more to be said about what he thought about Joy’s ‘crazy’ idea, Manu quietly went back to checking his messages, still reeling from the tempestuous exchange they’d just had. Several minutes went by when Joy casually asked, “Can I borrow your phone? I need to check something.” Emmanuel handed over the phone without hesitation, as he wasn’t really able to focus on what he was doing anyway. This was a decision he would soon regret, as within a few minutes, Joy asked him, “Are you spying on my phone?” Manu’s heart stopped. The confrontation he was planning to build up to had now come crashing down on him in an instant. 

Manu’s split-second hesitation only cemented in Joy’s mind that she had hit the nail on the head. “I can’t believe you! This whole time you’ve been reading my messages?” They had both stood up now; Manu’s posture taking on that of a supplicant toddler caught doing something he knew was wrong and needing the shouting to turn into forgiving hugs. “I’m doing everything I can to support you. You. My husband, who promised me a house on the hill. I’m feeding you, paying the rent, sending *your* kids to school! Yet this whole time you’ve been…” she struck the wall to her left as if it was all she could do to avoid striking her husband ""... SPYING ON ME!?"" The violence sent a jolt of paralyzing fear through Manu that he really hoped did not show in his face, or the slight flinch at her physical outburst. 

“You know, what you did was illegal, right?” A flash of disbelief swept over Manu as he processed that last utterance. Was this really her takeaway from this situation? “You’d better pray I don’t take you to the cops. I can’t sleep under the same roof as you. I don’t know where you’re going to sleep tonight, but it definitely won’t be here.” ‘*This isn’t how this is supposed to go down. Why is this happening?’*

A few hours later, the children came home from school. “Dad!” Manu jumped at the sound of Gift’s voice. He realized with embarrassed horror that he had been staring blankly at the wall and had forgotten that he had been reading a math problem when he had trailed off mid-sentence. He looked at his son, the shape of his face and golden bronze complexion echoing the visage that had been the object of his every teenage daytime reverie, but the confident gaze he was certain came from his sister, Faith. After struggling through the rest of the assignment with Gift, Manu retreated to the bathroom. 

Once he had locked the door, Manu wiped his eyes with the back of his hand. The tears that had been threatening to burst through the dam wall manifested themselves like damp creeping up from under the foundation. No shoulder-shaking shudders. No quiet, teary sniffles. He looked up toward the ceiling, and his gaze fell on the curtain rail in the shower. 

A terrible calm came over him. He pushed back the shower curtain to reveal the gleaming metal. *‘Will I learn anything on the other side of this rail?’* The thought terrified Manu on a level of consciousness that strangely seemed inaccessible to him in that moment. He watched almost helplessly as the belt came off his waist, looped itself through the buckle, a simple knot materializing around the cold metal rod. The sensation of putting the makeshift noose over his head was like being dipped headfirst into a bucket of water. As he knelt on the floor, he realized that he had to almost lie down to tighten the loop around his neck. He felt the world slipping away. With a jolt, he stood up. *‘Am I really doing this?’* Manu was almost embarrassed at the hesitation. *‘Manu, you’re not seriously thinking of doing this, are you? You know you want to live,’* Manu thought. ‘*Who are you kidding? You’re not going to go through with this? You can’t even work up the nerve to confront your wife; what more your Maker?’* Yet, once more, Manu found himself on his knees. A few more times, Manu stood up again. He did this again and again until he lost count. He didn’t even notice he had slipped away. As the world started to fade back into existence, he found himself on the shower floor. The shower curtain draped over his head, and the rail that had kept it up lay mangled next to his head. Realization began to dawn on him with a gripping terror. He would have been - no - should have been dead had it not been for the rail giving out under the stress of his full body weight. He had actually tried to end his own life. *‘Manu, what the hell are you doing?’* 

He tried his best to straighten the rail and put the curtain back, but it wouldn’t straighten all the way. Giving up, he folded up the shower curtain and stuffed it in the corner of the room that would be behind the door when it opened. He straightened his clothes, checked his facial expression in the mirror, then strode into the living room to find Joy sending Gift, Manly, and Victor to bed with a hug and a kiss each. When they saw their father, they all ran to him at once. “Good night, Dad!” Seeing their innocent smiles almost broke him down, but he kept his composure, managed a smile, and knelt to take them all into a bear hug. He felt his stomach twist, realizing it could have been Gift who discovered his lifeless body in the bathroom. Manu could not bring himself to imagine a world where he could be forgiven. 

As the children went to the bathroom before bed, Joy came up to Manu and whispered, “You were in there a while. What were you doing?” It shocked Manu how easily the words came out, “I’m sorry. I tried to hang myself in there. The rail gave out, and that’s the only reason we’re having this conversation.” A beat. Two beats. Three. The moment seemed to stretch for an eternity. “Manu, this just makes me clearer on me not wanting you around. I can’t believe you did that! Do you realize you could have completely devastated the kids? Now I’m wondering if having you around them is a good idea. In any case, this is all the more reason to have you out of the house. 

Joy started to gather her handbag, jacket and keys. “Let’s go.” They got into the car, and she drove toward Manu's dad's house on the other side of town. The 30-minute journey passed in an oppressive silence; the kind of silence in which your own thoughts slowly intensify the burden in small, excruciating increments in the same way that a corpse would bear the burden of earth thrown shovel by shovel. 

Arriving at Manu’s Dad’s house evoked a strange mix of pride for his father, shame for his failures, and dread for the moment of revelation as to why he was there. Using his own key, Manu opened the front door as man and wife let themselves into the house. 

Walking up the stairs in the grand entrance, Manu had a strange feeling of nostalgia as his gaze fell upon the huge Chinese vases that looked like naturally occurring outcrops in this indoor landscape forged into reality by the quiet genius that was his mother. He took pride in the fact that it was this force of nature that, with no architectural background, sketched the floor plans and prayed it into reality. ‘*The owners of this house are dreamers,’* Manu thought. ‘*Where did I miss it?’*

Honorable Judge Godgiven Kingsbow, besides being Manu’s father, had, and always would be, a towering figure in Manu’s mind. In the days of his youth, he had met Desire Riverland, the force of nature who would later become Manu’s mother. Together, they would compose songs of worship and devotion to God that had the nation singing, not only in churches, but at family gatherings, funerals, and weddings. They would go on to marry and build a life together. 

Emerging from his bedroom in his pajamas and plush bathrobe, Godgiven’s face was a canvas of surprise, confusion, and, dare Manu say, annoyance he didn’t have time to attempt to contain. “Hi Dad,” Manu tried, still coming up the stairs, cowering behind a smile meant to hide the humiliation coursing through his veins. “What’s going on?” Manu froze for a beat at the thought of having to launch into the reason for their appearance before even making it to the top of the stairs. “Come in! Come in!” he said, gesturing for them to walk into his bedroom, quickly dispelling the awkward energy before it suspended the three of them in a cocoon of temporal stasis, making the top of the stairs an unattainable summit.

With a sigh of relief that he immediately wished he had suppressed, Manu hastily completed his approach and gave his father a quick sidelong hug as he pushed past him into the master bedroom; Joy mimicked Manu’s actions with a nervous chuckle as she followed him up the remaining stairs, giving Judge Kingsbow a perfunctory hug as she made her way through the door. 

“Have you already done the needful?” Manu asked as he made his way to the kettle. He could feel Joy rolling her eyes as she witnessed Manu falling into the mundane habit of ‘doing the needful’, a code phrase for making tea, as was the custom of the house. “I’ve already had my tea, Manu, but feel free to make yourselves a cup.” “I’m not having any,” Joy said, almost too quickly. Manu, because he had his back turned, allowed a fleeting mask of rage to cover his visage at the assumption that he intended to serve her at all. It was gone as quickly as it had appeared, and he managed to offer a neutral facial expression to the world before he turned back around, kettle hissing in his wake.

“Is Mom still in Mazoe?” Joy asked. “Yes, she’s supervising the planting of this year’s crop,” the judge supplied with a dismissive wave of his hand. “So tell me,” he began, quickly steering the conversation, “To what do I owe the pleasure?” Manu, feeling it was his responsibility to get the ball rolling on this conversation, suddenly found his jaw had been wired shut, his shoes riveted to the newly tiled floor, and his eyes opened wide such that his face took on the expression of one he imagined had been subjected to King Chaka’s signature impalement method. Thankfully, without even looking at him, Joy intervened, “Dad, I think this is something that Manu has to tell you himself, alone.” The Judge’s eyebrows came together as he began to parse the information conveyed in Joy’s cryptic utterance. 

“Well, I’ll leave you guys to it,” she said, quickly picking up her handbag.  “Oh, you’re leaving?” Godgiven was visibly surprised. “Yes,” Joy offered with an apologetic smile and another nervous chuckle, picking up her handbag and making for the door. Before he could even give Manu a confused look, Joy was already on her way back down the stairs and opening the front door. “Go lock up after her,”  Godgiven instructed, resignation evident on his face, “then come back so you can tell me what’s going on.” 

With a nod, Manu went down the stairs. Thankfully, by the time he reached the door, Joy was already starting the engine and reversing out of the carport. The front door had been left slightly ajar, as without a key, one could not properly close the door. He closed the door, engaged the locking mechanism, turned around, and with head bowed, slowly marched his way up the stairs to face his father. 

***Chapter 2 - A Time, Times, and Half a Time***

*…Blindly leap from cliff to precipice*

*Boldly dive into the lofty brightness*

*Of glorious darkness beneath the Earth…*

* From ‘Greed’ by Member In Charge

As Manu approached the first step, his mind began to travel through time, back to the day he met Joy for the first time. He had just managed to get around to tackling his holiday assignment. It had been a struggle to get started on this project, as he had been so preoccupied with creating more music over the summer. Necessity was the gravity that brought him abruptly to the unforgiving surface that was reality, and as much as he wanted to spend more time in the home studio that G. Kingsbow Esq. had set up in the basement, Manu realized he needed to take care of business, or the school year would get off to a disappointing start.  Manu was 14 years old and was preparing to start 9th grade. 

Just as he had finally gotten to the period of the first sentence of his written assignment, the illustrious Desire Lynette Kingsbow, known to Manu simply as ‘Mom’, knocked on the already open door to his bedroom. “Hi, Mah.” “Hi, Manu. What are you up to?” “Just getting started on that school assignment I told you about. What’s up?” “That’s good, dear. I wanted to let you know that we had volunteered you and Faith to take the Rancher kids out and show them around town.” “The Rancher kids?” “Yeah. They’re about your age. They moved into town recently, and we thought it would be nice for you guys to show them around.” “Okay,” Manu said, drawing out the word as though he were in real-time contemplation. “When is this supposed to happen?” “Can you be ready in 15  minutes?” “Mah! I  just got started on my assignment.” “Don’t worry, Manu. It’ll only be a couple of hours, and you can come back early and leave them in your sister’s hands.” “Okay. I’ll get ready.” 

Manu didn’t like being ripped away from the project he had only just gotten around to starting; something he considered to be a feat in and of itself. However, he couldn’t shake the excitement of meeting new people, especially when it became known that one of the ‘Rancher kids’ was a girl. Manu quickly gave himself a pat on the back for his stroke of genius in deciding to take a shower as the first thing he had done that morning, as he consulted his wardrobe. Now all he had to do was figure out what to wear on this momentous occasion. 

Manu couldn’t help but smile at the memory of his innocent, 14-year-old self. As he took the second step toward his father’s room, it registered that he couldn’t recall the commute to the meeting spot that happened to be his father’s old workplace, a prominent law firm where he had recently made partner. Mr Rancher was the chief accountant at the same firm, having moved to Harare a month before this outing. Arriving there, Manu led Faith to their father’s office, sat on the two chairs provided for guests, and waited. “Where do you think we should take them?” Faith asked - her first words since leaving the house about 30 minutes ago. Faith, Manu’s younger sister, was ",1,1769929196.0,novelwriting,0,1.0,False

Then, I heat and froth the milk with a mini electric frother until I get a nice foam, and finally pour it over the coffee in the cup.

(From what I was able to find and buy, the difference between the two is that the instant coffee Nescafé Dolca Suave has a milder, more balanced flavor profile, with low acidity and moderate bitterness, and it contains less caffeine per cup than traditional coffee.

On the other hand, La Virginia Equilibrado ground roasted coffee offers a richer and more aromatic profile, with more body and notes that depend on the blend. Because it is roasted (torrado), it has a darker, slightly smoky flavor. According to the brand’s description, it scores **4/5 in aroma**, **4/5 in body**, **3/5 in acidity**, and **3/5 in roast level**.

Not trying to fat shame or be fat-phobic, but I recently met a mutual who is obese and has been getting on my nerves lately.

When she found out I was in healthcare, she immediately started shitting on healthcare providers. She told me she can’t lose weight even when she “doesn’t eat for days”, and she struggles with chronic fatigue and brain fog, yet doctors don’t listen to her bc of her BMI and they “don’t know shit about human bodies.”

At first, I was supportive. Women and people with higher BMIs certainly get dismissed in healthcare and such. But then she invited me and my friend to spend the weekend at hers. What later transpired had me feeling frustrated at the contradictions she was making. This is how a day eating with her went:

Breakfast- pancakes, waffles, croissants (yes she had all 3) with syrup and whipped cream. Then she wanted to stop by Dunkin’s for coffee otw to the shopping center. She got donuts and a signature caramel latte

Lunch: fried chicken, french fries, sliders, and mozzarella sticks

I was so full after breakfast and lunch but she still took us to get dessert which were french pastries

Dinner was ramen and fried sushi rolls (side note, I told her I was super full after every meal but she still took us)

At this point, I felt like throwing up from all the junk we had consumed and the lack of veggies/fruits. But when we got home guess what she had for us to eat. Cake, chocolate truffles, chocolate chip cookies, potato chips, and candies. No I am not exaggerating. She had all these laid out for us to eat while we watched a movie. By the time the day was over, I realized we had literally just been eating from 10 am to midnight.

And then she has the audacity to try to relate with my chronic illness (fibromyalgia + hEDS) by complaining about how she has been having health issues with always being tired and having brain fog…  oh and she declined my request for us to have some wine for girls night bc she’s “cutting out sugary drinks” and only had Coke Zero for us to drink.

Idk I’m definitely overreacting bc this hit a personal nerve w me as someone who works in healthcare and as someone who has debilitating chronic medical conditions.

1qsr9fy,https://www.reddit.com/r/MotivationByDesign/comments/1qsr9fy/why_quitting_smoking_feels_impossible_the/,Why Quitting Smoking Feels IMPOSSIBLE: The Neuroscience That Actually Works,"I spent way too much time researching nicotine addiction because honestly, watching people struggle with this shit while getting the same recycled advice frustrated me. ""Just have willpower"" is like telling someone with a broken leg to ""just walk normally."" The science shows it's way more complex than that.

Here's what nobody tells you: nicotine rewires your dopamine system faster than almost any other substance. Within days of regular smoking, your brain literally restructures itself. Dr. Nora Volkow (director of NIDA) explains that nicotine creates about 200 ""micro hits"" of dopamine per cigarette. Your brain gets conditioned to expect these hits constantly. It's not weakness, it's neurobiology.

The industry spent decades engineering cigarettes to be maximally addictive. They added ammonia compounds to increase nicotine absorption, designed the perfect nicotine delivery system, and created thousands of trigger associations in your daily routine. That's why quitting feels like fighting an invisible army.

But here's the good news, your brain can absolutely rewire itself. Neuroplasticity works both ways. The first 72 hours are hell because that's peak physical withdrawal, but the receptors start downregulating after that. Most physical addiction is gone within 2 weeks. The psychological part? That's the real battle, and it takes strategy.

**What actually works according to research:**

**1. Understand the two addiction types and tackle both**

Physical addiction is the easy part, seriously. It peaks at 3 days and mostly fades by week 2. The psychological addiction, the habit loops, the identity of being ""a smoker"", that's what destroys most quit attempts.

Dr. Judson Brewer's research at Brown shows that mindfulness based approaches have 2x the success rate of traditional methods. When you get a craving, instead of fighting it or giving in, you observe it. Notice exactly how it feels in your body. Where is the tension? What thoughts come up? Cravings typically peak at 3 minutes then fade. Most people relapse because they panic and assume the craving will intensify forever. It won't.

**2. Replace the ritual, not just the nicotine**

This is huge. Smoking isn't just about nicotine, it's about the hand to mouth motion, the breaks, the post meal ritual, the social bonding. You need replacement behaviors for each trigger.

James Clear talks about this in Atomic Habits (probably the most practical behavior change book that exists, NY Times bestseller for like 200 weeks straight, this guy understands habit loops better than anyone). He breaks down the cue routine reward cycle. For smoking, identify your specific cues. Morning coffee? Stressful work call? After sex? For each one, design a replacement routine that gives a similar reward.

One guy I know replaced cigarette breaks with ""oxygen breaks"" where he'd go outside and do box breathing for 3 minutes. Sounds stupid but it worked because it satisfied the same need, stepping away from work and resetting.

**3. Use pharmacology smartly, not as a crutch**

Nicotine replacement therapy doubles your success rate, but most people use it wrong. They go too low on dosage because they think they should ""tough it out."" That's dumb. The point is to decouple nicotine from smoking, then taper the nicotine slowly.

Champix/Chantix (varenicline) is insanely effective, about 3x better than willpower alone. It partially blocks nicotine receptors so smoking doesn't feel as good, while also providing some stimulation so withdrawal is manageable. Yeah the side effects can be weird (vivid dreams, nausea) but for most people they're mild and temporary.

**4. Reframe your identity immediately**

This sounds woo woo but it's critical. Stop saying ""I'm trying to quit"" or ""I'm a smoker who's quitting."" You're a non smoker now. Period. When offered a cigarette, don't say ""I'm trying to quit"", say ""I don't smoke."" The language programs your subconscious.

Alan Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking is weirdly cult like but genuinely effective for many people (helped millions quit, translated into like 40 languages, celebrities swear by it). His core premise is that smoking provides zero actual benefits, only the relief of withdrawal it created. Once you internalize that, the desire vanishes. Some people read it and quit immediately, others think it's complete nonsense. Worth a shot though.

**5. Plan for the psychological extinction burst**

Around week 3 to 4, after the physical withdrawal is gone, many people get hit with intense random cravings. This is called an extinction burst, your brain's last ditch effort to get you back to the old behavior. Knowing this is coming prevents you from thinking you've ""failed"" or that quitting isn't working.

**6. Use the Smoke Free app religiously**

This app is legitimately one of the best quitting tools available. It tracks your progress, shows health improvements in real time (lung function, heart rate, cancer risk reduction), has a massive supportive community, and sends you personalized missions based on behavioral psychology. The gamification aspect keeps you engaged during tough moments.

**7. Address the underlying needs smoking met**

Most people smoke to regulate stress, boredom, or social anxiety. If you don't develop alternative regulation strategies, you're whiteknuckling it forever. The Calm app has specific programs for cravings and stress management that pair well with quitting. Insight Timer has tons of free addiction recovery meditations.

There's also BeFreed, a personalized learning app built by Columbia grads and former Google engineers. You can set a goal like ""quit smoking for good"" or ""manage stress without cigarettes,"" and it creates a structured learning plan pulling from addiction research, behavioral psychology books, and expert insights on nicotine dependence. 

For real deep work on why you smoke, check out The Craving Mind by Dr. Judson Brewer. He's a neuroscientist and psychiatrist who combines brain imaging research with mindfulness training. The book explains the actual brain mechanisms of craving and gives you tools to work with them instead of against them. Legitimately changed how I understand all addictive behaviors.

**The timeline nobody warns you about:**

Days 1-3: Physical hell. Irritability, headaches, insomnia. This is actually a good sign, it means your body is detoxing.

Days 4-14: Physical symptoms ease but psychological cravings are intense. Every trigger feels massive.

Weeks 3-8: The danger zone. You feel ""mostly better"" so your guard drops. One cigarette ""won't hurt."" Except it will restart everything.

Months 3-6: Occasional strong cravings, usually tied to specific triggers you haven't reprogrammed yet.

Year 1+: You're basically free, but stay vigilant around alcohol and high stress periods.

**What definitely doesn't work:**

Cutting down gradually. Research shows this just prolongs suffering and rarely leads to quitting.

Relying purely on willpower. Your willpower is finite, addiction is not.

Beating yourself up after a slip. Shame makes relapse more likely, not less.

Look, nicotine addiction is legitimately one of the hardest to break because it's so deeply woven into your daily routine and identity. But your brain is plastic, your body wants to heal, and millions of people who were just as addicted as you have quit successfully. You're not special in a bad way, which means you can do what they did.

The difference between people who quit successfully and those who don't isn't willpower or character. It's understanding the neuroscience, having the right tools, and being strategic about behavior change. Treat it like the serious medical condition it is, not a moral failing.

Stats: all three of us are above median at T14.

pic #1 applied 1/3 in November, 2/3 in December+Jan;  
pic #2 applied all in October + November;  
pic #3 applied 10% in November, rest in late December;

**#Interview Tips**  
*this is not the most time efficient method to do things. but it works.*

1 - do your prep! Goes without saying... I have one huge google doc with **all the possible behavioral questions and what experiences I will be talking about + three-bullet point why firm + why practice area + why location + I spend around 30 min per interviewer to research their experiences (firm website + linkedin usually suffice)**. This is especially useful for people without a strong confidence in their interview performance and significantly helped with conversion. My friends (pic #2 +pic #3) are naturally stronger at interviewing and definitely did not prep this much and they are laughing at me while I write this tip.

2 - ask interesting questions. a lot of interview these days leave u 10-15 minutes to ask them questions. PLEASE, do not ask ""how is the culture"" or ""what does your day to day look like."" This is your chance to salvage your entire interview even if you bombed the behaviorals. half of your prepped questions should be related to that interviewer's experience/practice group, the other half should be very interesting repeatable questions. FWIW I have 10 questions in total for each interviewer and often draft follow-ups to each question.

3 - be funny and sound relaxed. Walk into every interview thinking you are interviewing them could be a good start.  a behavioral question is just your chance to tell an interesting story abt yourself. even if you have answered the question 10000 times, still try to answer it like you are explaining the story for the first time ever.

4 - they always ask ""tell me about yourself"" to start, prepare your personal life story and SAY SOMETHING UNIQUE in that speech! You can decide how the interview goes from there.

5 - reflect, improve. *again, this takes a lot of time, but it works*. write down a quick debrief about the interview, what questions you got asked, which ones you answered well on, what questions you asked and what they responded. especially important for screener->callback rounds. a screener is probably the single most informational 1 on 1 chat you are having with that firm prior to the callback.

**#Application/Networking Tips**

1 - apply early. Although most movements happened after grade submission, most if not all of offers are from applications submitted in November. I did multiple pre-grade screeners and a few pre-grade callbacks over winter.

2 - know your niche. especially for transactional people. If you say you like ""general corporate"" at a networking event/interview it is harder for attorneys to relate to. I strongly encourage you to find what you want to do and have a ""why practice area"" before the entire process, even if it changes mid-way it's ok.

Knowing your niche also applies to the kind of person you are. I know exactly what kind of people are more likely to relate to my stories and help out, so at a networking event I'll be very intentional. All the firms we networked with (as in good enough convo + follow up) have given us movements.

3 - ask interesting questions, see point 2 above. At a group networking event this is especially important because it will likely be 1 attorney v. 5 students. Leave the generic questions for someone else and pick up the interesting points to follow up on. If possible, do 1v1 at those group events. but imo solo coffee chats usually are not that helpful and the opportunity cost of study time is huge.

4 - 1L fall is like blind dating, your grades is still number 1 priority. networking with the right people can get your foot into the door but cant drag you entirely in.

5 - in terms of selective networking, design a ""reach"" ""match"" ""safety"" range and heavy network 2-3 firms in each bucket. This preps you for when your grades come out and you will have strong connections no matter where your grades fall onto.

6 - remember stuff. at every event I take bathroom breaks between conversations and write down everything I remember about them/the firm in my notes app. This helped me SO much when I'm thinking about my why-firm.

7 - if you didn't send a thank you email/connect on linkedin, you didn't rly ""network""

**\*Going from Here\***  
if you are currently not hearing back + losing hope, don't. The key to this is to land one offer ASAP, and the rest will move fast. btw, the firms we applied to in december are JUST getting back to us. so hang on here!

we wanna give back and are happy to answer questions via comments/pm! :)

1qsr1wr,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumpsandBeyondAu/comments/1qsr1wr/need_a_pep_talk_please_or_advice/,Need a pep talk please or advice.,"Hi everyone. I have a beautiful 5 week old baby boy and from weeks 0-4 he basically slept anywhere and through any sound. I could soothe him any time with my breast and he fed like a dream. 

As soon as week 4 hit, he became incredibly fussy. He was refusing my breast for a while which was stressful and heartbreaking (it’s still sorta happening here and there) and now day time naps are a complete struggle. He prefers contact naps or the carrier. 

My partner went interstate this weekend so I took the time to bunker down and get his day time naps in. I think I’ve figured out that his wake windows are actually more like 60 minutes rather than what the internet says (up to 90 minutes). 

It can be really difficult to put him down, but when he’s down he may whimper and cry a bit. But I pause and watch for up to 30 seconds and he tends to settle. 

He’s also so sensitive to sound so we have to tip toe around the room once he’s down. My husband put down his phone earlier and it woke him up 😩

My question is … how is this viable when you head out and about? Right now he’s only 5 weeks old and we haven’t ventured out too much because he’s not vaccinated just yet. But how do you stay on top of wake windows so they dont get overtired? It’s an absolute nightmare getting him to sleep when that happens and 9 times out of 10 he will just stay awake for hours on end. I was so looking forward to the day where I could take him out for coffees and grocery runs (I’m getting cabin fever bad). But it looks like I will be housebound forever 🥲

Idk I just needed to ask for any advice and to vent. Although it seems like I understand how to get him down (for today lol), I feel defeated and like I cannot see the light at the end of the tunnel. ",4,1769927922.0,BabyBumpsandBeyondAu,15,0.84,False

What do I do?,"I am a 24-year-old female who recently accepted a position at a hospital facility as a power engineer/maintenance worker. I have worked at several different sites in the past and have never had any issues.

I recently began a full-time position at a long-term care facility where I work with two other engineers, one of whom is the team lead. Since starting, the other engineer has shared with me some of the complaints the lead has made about me. These include how I make coffee before my shift and drink it after clocking in, as well as the pants I wear to work. Although my clothing is appropriate, they are thrifted rather than expensive. While these comments were frustrating, I was willing to make small changes to maintain a positive work environment.

More recently, however, my work environment has become uncomfortable. I was told that I would be trained at this site by the chief engineer, but instead, of showing me and leading me on the right path with things He often asks me how I would complete a task, and regardless of my answer, he tells me it is wrong—even when my response matches his, just worded differently. When he does provide an explanation, it is only after dismissing my answer.

I have asked him to show me how he prefers tasks to be done so I can work independently and avoid conflict. However, he frequently does not show me, then becomes upset when the task is not completed. As a result, I have had to ask the other engineer for guidance instead.

Additionally, the lead has made inappropriate comments about my personal life, including my partner and finances, suggesting that my partner should be financially responsible for me. He has also criticized my appearance, the stickers on my car, how I dress, how I organize my email, and has said that I act “too young” for a professional environment. He has stated that I should stop “acting like the boss” and implied that he would “do something about it” if I did not.

I asked the other engineer whether he felt I had acted unprofessionally, and he confirmed that I have not. He has also expressed frustration at having to listen to repeated negative comments about me.

This situation has caused me significant anxiety, as I have never experienced this type of treatment in a workplace before. I am unsure how to proceed and would appreciate guidance on how to handle this professionally.",2,1769927548.0,workplace_bullying,2,1.0,False

1qsqv9l,https://i.redd.it/wru5tvv1utgg1.png,[Weekend Jam] Built a 5-Level Dark Platformer in HTML/JS - LUMINA: Chapter I (Play in Browser!),"I hunkered down this past weekend and cranked out this little atmospheric platformer called **LUMINA: Chapter I** in \~20 hours of pure vanilla HTML5 Canvas + JS. No Unity, no Godot, just me, some coffee, and a lot of tweaking physics till it felt snappy.

**What's in it:**

* Tight WASD + Space jump + Z shoot controls
* 5 hand-crafted levels with spikes, patrolling enemies (shoot 'em!), key-to-door progression
* Pixel art vibes, procedural trees, particle trails/explosions, screen shake
* Synth BGM (Web Audio API drone), sound FX, and creepy TTS narration (""The air grows thin. Do not fall."")
* CRT scanlines, HUD, pause/death/restart menus
* Fully playable/responsive in any browser (sound recommended!)

Screenshot of the nail-biting Level 4 platforming:

It starts simple (tutorial vibes) but ramps up, Level 5 is a proper gauntlet with timed enemy clears over spike pits. Died a *ton* respawning with 3HP lives. Super satisfying when you nail the flow though.

What'd I learn? Web Audio for BGM is underrated AF, and pixel-perfect collision is a grind but worth it.   
  
Feedback? Brutal honesty welcome too hard? Controls janky on mobile? Polish ideas? Hit me!

Cheers,

1qsqv6i,https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/1qsqv6i/im_definitely_not_trans/,I'm definitely not trans.,"Like sure when I was a kid I wanted to grow up to be Jill Valentine, what little boy doesn't? 


It's just because she has better weapons than Chris and great hair 

Like eah my favorite movies are Akira, Ghost in the Shell and The Matrix but that's just because I resonated with the themes of the commodification of identity and the cinematography was really good. 
The alienation from watching one's body turn into an unrecognizable monstrosity is completely relatable and totally cis.

Sure I felt just like Shinji Ikari having to pilot a giant horrible robot because I didn't want to let my dad down but that was definitely about not waiting to be a failure and okay so I wanted to be Asuka but that's definitely just because she was more confident and pretty and what guy doesn't want to be beautiful?

Like yeah of course I stole my girlfriends underwear, they just made my ass look so cute. And why wouldn't you shave your body and wear lavender deodorant, do you want to look like a smelly gorilla?

 Completely cis thoughts.

I mean what guy doesn't want to wear skirts and dresses,  male clothes are just so boring.  
I mean shit it's completely normal to want to be a woman, it'd be so fucking badass to be able to go grocery shopping and get coffee and hear your chosen name which is soft and strong just like you.

 I mean that's just guys being bros right?",11,1769927290.0,MtF,6,0.77,False

    * Strong scripting and automation skills: Python, Bash, PowerShell
    * Experience securing CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions strongly preferred)
    * Familiarity with MITRE ATT&CK and D3FEND frameworks
    * Understanding of enterprise and cloud network security architecture and controls
    * SOC 2 and/or ISO 27001 compliance experience
    * Self-starter comfortable with ambiguity - ability to define and execute on loosely-scoped problems
    * Balanced communication style - proactive collaborator when needed, deep-focus engineer when required
    * Excellent written and verbal communication skills for cross-functional collaboration


### Preferred Qualifications:
    * Experience building application security programs from early stages
    * Hands-on experience with Data Loss Prevention (DLP) solutions
    * Familiarity with HackerOne, Bugcrowd, or similar bug bounty/VDP platforms

Unlock the best of both worlds with a remote role that keeps you connected! We're looking for passionate individuals in the Greater Toronto Area to join our team. While you'll enjoy the flexibility of working from home, you can take advantage of periodically coming to our vibrant downtown Toronto office to connect with colleagues, collaborate on exciting projects, and take part in company events. This is your opportunity to be a part of our thriving workplace culture.
**Culture and Diversity**
Wattpad is an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate. Period. 
Wattpad welcomes and encourages applications from people with disabilities. Accommodations are available on request for candidates taking part in all aspects of the selection process. We have taken a leadership position on creating a culture and an organization that truly values diversity. We are committed to fostering a global team that reflects the diversity of the Wattpad community. At Wattpad, we believe cultural fit doesn’t mean culturally identical, and diversity of thought helps us to challenge one another to think big and think differently. We consider employment applicants without regard to age, race, colour, national origin, citizenship, religion, creed, sex, sexual orientation, veteran status, marital status, disability status or any other protected status. 
If you have any special needs or accessibility requirements, please let us know. We will do our utmost to accommodate, in accordance with applicable local legislation.
Don’t meet all the requirements? Studies show women and people of colour are less likely to apply to jobs if they do not meet all the qualifications. Therefore, in an effort to build a more diverse workplace, we encourage you to apply anyways. You might actually be the right person or you may be a good fit for a number of other openings we currently have.

1qsqsdm,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1qsqsdm/long_resting_short_peak_window_on_ultralight/,"Long resting, short peak window on ultra-light roasts?","I’ve noticed with ultra-light roasts that some beans need 1–2 months of resting, but once they finally open up, the actual peak window is very short and sometimes only a few days to a week before they start fading.

I’m also in a tropical, high-humidity climate, which seems to make staling happen faster than what’s usually discussed online.

How do you guys:
1. Store your beans? (airtight / vacuum / freezer)

2. Decide when a coffee has hit its peak?

3. Know when to vacuum seal and freeze?

4. Split bags into small batches to catch the peak?

Would love to hear what works for you, especially in humid climates.

Thank you :)",1,1769927027.0,pourover,1,0.67,False
