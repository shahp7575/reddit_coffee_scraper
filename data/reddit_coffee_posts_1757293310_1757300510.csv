‚Ä¶it‚Äôs the humble looking Whipped Honey and Vanilla!

I‚Äôm going to preface this by saying I‚Äôm a gourmand lover and an absolute fiend for honey in all forms. I was so excited for this one, and it was love at first sniff!

Well, or so I thought.

The opening is a lovely whipped cream and honey scent evoking a fresh pastry. However, the dry down becomes sickly and cloying. It‚Äôs like you dumped a bottle of coffee flavoring syrup onto your skin, then let it dry in 90 degree heat. It smells like you‚Äôd expect your skin to feel sticky. Unfortunately, it has an odd staying power for BBW, making it hard to get off your skin or dilute once applied.

It actually triggered a coughing fit for me, and I don‚Äôt have any allergies at all!

So yeah, this definitely isn‚Äôt one you should blind buy, try it IRL first!

1nbclp6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1nbclp6/there_is_a_predator_living_in_my_neighborhood/,There is a predator living in my neighborhood,"I, (27 F), live at home with my family in the family home we‚Äôve lived in my entire life. It‚Äôs the home my family purchased after immigrating to the U.S. back in the 80s and it‚Äôs literally the home that will be in our family for decades to come, (I.e. moving away is not an option as we‚Äôre low income and there‚Äôs just no way we‚Äôd be able to swing living anywhere else). 

For as long as I‚Äôve been in this neighborhood, my neighbor across the street has been a creep. For context, I have memories of this man eyeing me and all my friends when we were literal children and us all knowing to limit interaction with him as a result upon incidents of him doing/saying weird things to us. I even have memories of him doing things like asking for me to sit on his lap when I was a literal child the few times my immigrant family would try to keep the peace by interacting with him and inviting him over for coffee, (not too much on my family as they were immigrants who were unassuming of everyone and just trying to be neighborly at the time, they now know how much of a weirdo and predator he is and would never do it again). It boggles my mind how we were conditioned to think of it this way, but it was always a thing of, ‚ÄúOh, well you know him!!! He‚Äôs always been a little weird!‚Äù. 

The story goes that this person was in a terrible car accident with some other neighborhood kids when they were teens, and this accident killed some of the passengers and severely injured others. My childhood friends older sister was one of the people in the accident and she had severe injuries, while this person ended up in a wheelchair and cognitively impaired because it hurt a certain part of his brain and he was in a coma for a while as a result. I had always heard growing up that this injury is what lead to him being predatory, but I can‚Äôt say for certain because I really have no idea and it feels ignorant to make such a claim without knowing for sure. Regardless, he lives at home with his widowed mom who seems to just let him do what he wants, I assume because he‚Äôs a fully grown man and what can she really do? We‚Äôve tried to tell her about some of the things that have happened, but it seems that she willfully ignores it and wants no part in any of the information. 


What we know for certain is that one of the kids I would play with when we were little was SA‚Äôd by this person when we were children and I *believe* he was convicted of something related to this, (I‚Äôm really not sure as the family moved out of our neighborhood soon after and this person seemingly disappeared for a while after). We heard rumblings that his mother sent him to live in the Philippines after the fact, but neither me or my family or other neighbors know for certain. One day, he reappeared in my neighborhood when I was well into my adolescence and has since resumed his predatory ways. I‚Äôm now in my 20s and since the time he‚Äôs been back, (so over the course of 12 years), there have been incidents of him revealing his fully naked self to my mom at 6am when she was out getting the newspaper and no one was around, (he‚Äôs done this to other neighbors btw), him approaching teenage girls in my neighborhood asking if they want an older boyfriend because he can ‚Äúteach them a lot‚Äù, him trying to get into cars while neighbors (female neighbors btw) are unloading groceries, and so many other incidents I can‚Äôt even begin to list because there‚Äôs just so many of them. We even suspect that he roams the neighborhood alerting people he knows of certain cars they can break into, (my catalytic converter has been stolen twice and we suspect him being apart of it because he was seen on the ring footsge going back and forth next to my car as it was happening both times, like he was keeping watch. We know of other neighbors having similar stories/footage). 

More recently I‚Äôve gotten home late from being out with friends only to pull up to our driveway to see him staring at our house from outside our front gate.  Within the last two months he had the cops called on him by our next door neighbors when he stayed outside their house staring at the door leading to their backyard/garage area for two hours, refusing to leave despite them politely pleading with him to back away from their property. It‚Äôs honestly gotten to the point where I feel uncomfortable going outside and am always vigilant because I fear for my safety.

Every time cops have gotten involved they tell us and our neighbors the same thing: there‚Äôs no concrete evidence and he isn‚Äôt ever ‚Äútechnically doing anything wrong‚Äù so nothing can be done and considering the times he‚Äôs revealed himself, tried getting into cars, approached the teenage girls in our neighborhood, etc. can‚Äôt be definitively proven, they never really even try to do anything aside from giving him a stern talking to. 

Reddit, is there anything I can do? 
I think the reason that this has gone on as long as it has is because I live in a predominantly immigrant neighborhood made up of mostly elders who have the belief of, ‚Äúmind your own business‚Äù. I don‚Äôt agree with this obviously, but I also am fearful he might retaliate? Is there even anything I can do? I‚Äôm honestly at a loss. 

What prompted me to write this is his being outside not even 20 mins ago and trying to talk to me while I was loading things into my car, telling me to let him into our yard. Any advice or precautions we can take would be greatly appreciated. ",1,1757300315.0,Advice,0,0.99,False

1nbcexy,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1nbcexy/what_i_really_really_want/,"What I really, really want","Dear A,

We met online on the last Tuesday of August. As we started talking about everything, I was so looking forward to speaking with you again and again.

You know this already because I told you. Now it's Sunday morning and just like the Another Chance video, my heart became too big and probably scared you.

I cried, reasoned with God, talked to my therapist and waited for you to come back. 

I know there are so many things that are against our connection including distance, age difference and probably my ugly and old face. Despite the obstacles, real or imagined, I want you. It may sound silly and overwhelming, but I wanted to be your girlfriend, you lover, your friend. 

I was thinking of your voice and laugh. Your cats and your ways sighing that I can't tell you this in person.

The wind is heavy this morning and I wish I was sitting in your lap embraced in my garden chair. The wind chime balancing a random tune. I imagine romantic gestures with no words, while our coffees(decaff for you) are getting cold. The smell of you in my nostrils, my mouth searching yours until they meet. A sudden rush of blood to my heart and letting go of everything else. God, I wish this moment would never end.

My imagination moves your hands on my breasts and I start melting Everything feels right and I want to make love to you slowly, mapping your body and feeling happy that you found me.

I really hope you will come back to me. I miss you....

So why do we question each other? Why do we pull each other's leg? Why do we criticize each other? The only way we can apprise more and more people about them is when we all stand together and try our best to reduce their reach and views. It CANNOT be done by a single member of this Sub, a single podcaster or a single creator. We will have to work together and we will have to be UNITED. ",7,1757299607.0,janabmadamFAKEverse,2,1.0,False

# it's a banger

A footman hand delivered a letter to the cozy side of east 61st and Agnes informs us that Aurora's bleeding heart has found a new cause to drip all over, Marian tells the room that the charity Aurora has chosen this time is the Red Cross and it will kick off with Clara Barton giving a speech to find help with the fundraising efforts to which Ada is very excited to attend. Then Ada who is doing needlepoint by the window spots My Girlie Gladys leaving the house on a walk with her governess and Marian exclaims ""ugh she's with a babysitter! I know I, a grown woman, HATE that"" and Agnes is like ""the only sensible thing that woman across the street does is keep that daughter away from making stupid choices"" and Marian is like ""sounds like a prison"" so Ada decides to push the conversation in a different direction ""Why hasn't the girl who is very clearly debutante age not made her debut?"" and Agnes is like ""oh I know the answer to this one...well I know the answer to everything...but the answer here is that Mrs. Russell knows no one will come to a ball thrown by her""

Outside my Girlie Gladys and her pleasant jailer are walking to find a carriage because Gladys has a secret assignation planned with some boy and she's blackmailed the governess into being her accomplice because she caught her stealing booze. My question is if her parents don't know this man (which we know because the governess is pushing her to introduce him to them) her brother until recently has been away at college, the governess herself doesn't know this man yet, and Gladys isn't allowed out of the house unaccompanied and since she isn't out she's not going to social events...HOW DID SHE MEET HIM?! Did she answer an ad for a pen pal in the paper?! Does she like pi√±a coladas and getting caught in the rain?! Seriously, someone make it make sense.

[how did they meet?!](https://i.redd.it/ra7b5eshcunf1.gif)

Back inside the cozy side but downstairs, Mrs. Gambler and Little Red are of course preparing a huge meal when Jack walks in with an adorable disheveled hair swoop and a newspaper. He's read in said paper that there is a magic lantern show opening on Broadway that weekend and he wants to know if Little Red wants to go with him and she instantly starts stalling, but Mrs. Gambler is like ""please don't waste your life in someone else's kitchen all the time and go have some fun...please!"" so Jack asks Mr. Bannister if its cool even though Little Red didn't say yes and Bannister is all like ""This job is supposed to be like 27/7"" and Mrs. Gambler is like ""let the kids play!!!""

[Bridget wants to stab Mrs. Bauer at the end there](https://i.redd.it/yac1ffjjfunf1.gif)

Across the street Daddy is doing Robber Barony things in his home office when the So Far Failed Socialite comes in with a copy of The Times and is like ""it says in the paper that the alderman may rescind the law? how will we get that station if they do this"" and Railroad Daddy is like ""say what? this is some bullshit but I guess I knew these assholes would try to fuck me somehow...anyway where is my baby?"" and she's like ""she‚Äôs out with her babysitter, because she's a baby"" and he's like ""she's only a baby to me in the sense that she's my little girl but she's a grown ass woman because this is the 1880s and we treat 16 year olds like they are rational and capable adults"" and she's like ""she's a baby until I say otherwise""

So we follow Railroad Daddy to his actual office. He's asked Mr. Stinkface to come by, Daddy didn't do enough spanking last week because he's ready to smack some more bottoms. Mr. S is like ""I am an important Old Money man, please don't speak to me like I am a servant"" and RD is like ""bitch, when I'm done with you, you're going to be on those knees BEGGING me for the privilege of shining my shoes‚Äù and Mr. S is like ""I came here because you asked me to but I'm not going to be insulted by an upstart"" and RD is like ""you came here because you know if you didn't I would show up at your place of work and spank that ass harder than I did to your wife"" and Mr. S is like ""politicians are going to politic and we are supposed to serve the people, the people don't want a big ugly mass transit center in the middle of the City, that seems like it will only help the poors!"" and RD is like ""are you going to pretend that you didn't do a bunch of insider trading and get rich and then decide to screw me so you can turn around and get even more rich when you're dancing on my grave?"" and Mr. S is like ""I don't know what you‚Äôre talking about"" and storms out of the office humming *We're In The Money*

[Mr. Smugface is more apt I think](https://preview.redd.it/y018ibsmmunf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=a08514bcaca714273f9588876f03ae41b00df2a2)

We head to the charity meeting Girl Cousin has organized and I am sorry this magnificent room is in her HOUSE?! this looks like a fucking chapel, my god rich people fucking suck. Anyway these people are at the edge of their seat while Ms. Barton is trying to make their hearts bleed money, one of the enraptured audience members is THE Caroline Webster Schermerhorn Astor who seems to be one of the only people who can make Mrs. Stinkface actually smile. There is a man standing behind them who keeps making eyes over at Ada who is on the other side of the room. The talk is over and the man beelines across the room to Ada and is like ""Yo do you remember me?! and the Spinster is thinking to herself *men don‚Äôt circle the block for women like me so it cannot possibly be who I think it is* and he‚Äôs like ‚ÄúI am Cornelius Eckworthlessington III! You remember me? I tried to pick up all those years ago but then I moved to Connecticut‚Äù and Marian who we know is stubborn but also doesn‚Äôt yet have a good judgment when it comes to men is like ‚Äúaw this is so sweet! how random that you happened to run into someone you knew like 50 years ago!‚Äù and he‚Äôs like ‚Äúactually, Mrs. Stinkface is my niece, she told me that your aunt would be here so I figured I'd come see if she is as naive now as she was back then"" and Marian who is totally oblivious to how smarmy this guy is like ""you should call on us at 61st street!"" and he bounds off excited by that invitation. As he leaves the hostess and Mrs. S come over to say hello and Girl Cousin is like ""hey cuz, you think you can back my newest cause?"" and Little Miss Stubborn is like ""you know who has a lot of money to donate? MY FUCKING NEIGHB..."" and Mrs. S is like ""NOT AGAIN YOU TIRESOME LITTLE GIRL!!! Stop talking about that nouveau riche nincompoop!!! Besides my man said her man is a liar and a thief. I don't know the specifics but my angel would NEVER lie or be dishonorable!"" and she storms off. Marian is like ""she has to have that wrong because I am right about everything!""

[this is inside a HOUSE](https://preview.redd.it/6r1owtbvmunf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4d059c0bd3daaa43c6a83b422992b06c6a2cabf)

Back to Russell Manor and the So Far Failed Socialite is trying to get Railroad Daddy explain to her exactly how the alderman are screwing them, and its a good thing because I don't think any of The Poors like myself watching this show have any idea about how stocks work. So he tells her that after they repeal the law, the stock in the Robber Baron Consolidated Trust will plummet and then be super cheap, so they will rebuy the stock at the low low price and then pass the law again which will raise the price by an astronomical rate but by then the Russells will be broke. SFFS is like ""I didn't marry a weak punk ass bitch, FIGHT BACK!"" and he's like ""but if I do it's got to be off the books dirty fighting, in which we might lose all of this anyway"" and she's like ""and?! I still have my farm girl clothes in the closet. I can sweep floors for a bit"" and he's like ""damn if the kids weren't home I'd do you right here and now."" Daddy leaves the drawing room is about to go upstairs when my Girlie Gladys cuts him off ""oh DADDY, can you do me a big favor? Pretty please with a cherry on top?"" and he's like ""is this going to get me in trouble? because right now you mom is my favorite person""

[ROMAN EMPIRE](https://i.redd.it/iloq15k1dunf1.gif)

Across the street Marian is telling Agnes about running into Ada's old beau and she's like ""oh I remember that family, they were poor and my daddy had good sense to keep them away from us"" and Marian is like ""seems like they used to date or something"" and Agnes is like ""so you think he's circling the block for this old spinster?"" and Ada is like ""hey, I'm right here"" but Marian jumps in and is like ""I bet he is going to circle the block, pick her up and let his horse poop on your door step as they leave you forever!"" but before Agnes can retort her son walks in and is like ""Hey! I just thought I'd come in and say hello since I am having dinner with your favorite new neighbors!"" and Agnes is looking like she's trying to battle her body from having a stroke.

[Recycled Fellowes Line Alert!](https://i.redd.it/531db9xseunf1.gif)

Back to the Manor and Daddy stepped out of his office to see the Troublemaker walking in the hall and he's like ""Yo, where is that babe I am married to?"" and the Troublemaker who doesn't miss an opportunity gets right up in his personal space bubble and you can see he's thinking to himself *why did I ask this bitch anything?! She proved last week she's not afraid to push the envelope* so she‚Äôs like ‚Äúmy lord and master, I hope you realize everyone on staff, but especially me, would do ANYTHING you asked of us, because we want you to be successful so we can keep our jobs but also because I just worship the ground you walk on‚Äù and he‚Äôs moving so fast to get away from her you would think he‚Äôs on fire. The butler is skulking around the corner and has put the Troublemaker on his watch list.

We‚Äôre in the dinner that Oscar was invited to and the So Far Failed Socialite is trying to make small talk with him. He says his career path was nepotistically chosen for him and his daddy was founding member of the bank he works for. He says this bank was founded in 1797, and we find out (later) in this episode that his dad died 10 years ago in 1872‚Ä¶that‚Äôs 75 years between the founding and his death. So let‚Äôs say he was 20 when the bank was founded‚Ä¶.he was 95 when he died. Agnes married him 40 years prior (we learned that earlier in the episode) so this man was mean, abusive, and around 65 when he married Agnes?! I know she can be uppity and prejudiced but I will always stan a woman who threw herself into the arms of a lurid man to save her sister.

Anyway back to dinner, Larry goes all melancholic when he hears Oscar followed marching orders into the family business because its obvious that is exactly what he doesn‚Äôt want to do himself, my Girlie Gladys who always seems to want to sway the conversation in another direction shouts out ‚ÄúCAN WE TALK ABOUT MY BOYFRIEND INSTEAD?!‚Äù and her mother is like ‚Äúthe fuck? we have a guest‚Äù and Oscar the guest is like ‚Äúoh I know him because one thing Old Money will do is create alliances between families by any means necessary‚Ä¶its usually incest but in this case its just that his auntie was named as my godmother! anyway, my dad was like 40 years older than my mother, so I think severe age gaps are the way to go and Archie is not even 10 years older than you? he‚Äôs basically still in the womb‚Äù and my Girlie is like ‚Äúbut he‚Äôs a hottie and Daddy is going to invite him to dinner‚Äù and Daddy is like ‚Äúare you trying to get me killed?! I said we had to ask your beautiful sugar plum fairy of a mother for permission because I would ever go behind your back like that babe I love you so much please do not be mad at me, I want sex later‚Äù and SFFS is like ‚Äúyou best believe no one sits at this table without my express invitation! never forget who is the real head of household!‚Äù and Daddy doesn‚Äôt argue because he wants that sex later. My Girlie chimes in with ‚Äúalso the hottie‚Äôs family is so old and established that they were like fighting at the inception of this country!‚Äù and Larry swoops his head up so that little curl on his forehead does a little dance and he says ‚Äúwere your great grandparents even here 100 years ago or were they too busy paddywhacking the potato farm in your motherland?‚Äù and RD is like ‚Äúwhat the hell did I pay for college for if you don‚Äôt understand her being Irish makes you Irish too?!‚Äù and then Curls apologizes to his father for being dumb instead of apologizing to his mother for attempting to belittle her. Oscar wants to turn the conversation from the awkward direction its taking and asks Railroad Daddy about the railroad that he‚Äôs the daddy of, and we all know things are not going well so the conversation stays awkward. Now SFFS decides to ask Oscar about his eye for architecture and Oscar spins it into an opportunity to flirt with My Girlie so he asks her opinion and you can see she‚Äôs shook because no one ever has asked he opinion about anything before so she blushes and her mother smells a rat and is now side eying the hell out of Mr. Van Rhijn.

[Larry has been a jerk to his mom the whole time](https://i.redd.it/b20qbac0iunf1.gif)

Across the street Marian is reading a letter and Agnes‚Äô nosy ass is like ‚ÄúLET ME READ IT!‚Äù and Ada is like ‚Äúboundaries!‚Äù and Marian is like ‚Äúit‚Äôs from the lawyer, he‚Äôs leaving Doylestown and moving to Manhattan‚Äù and Agnes is like ‚Äúwhy does he think you‚Äôll care about that? we had that tea party so we could be rid of him!‚Äù and Marian is like ‚ÄúI am not going to like run off and marry him but it would be fun to have a friend who knows where I come from?‚Äù and Agnes is like ‚Äúno not this man because he won‚Äôt be content with just being your friend. I have been around the block several times and I have seen many men like this one‚Ä¶he belongs to the streets, leave him there‚Äù

Back to the Manor and Bertha is wearing a nightgown that is so see-through she can set the house on fire with how hot she looks and I know because I am on fire just looking at her. Daddy thanks her for saving him from discussing the potential demise of his company at dinner but he then tells her that they should let My Girlie‚Äôs boyfriend come to dinner because she should have a social life and The Smoke Show is like ‚ÄúNope, I will pick her husband and he ain‚Äôt it. Neither is that Van Rhijn dude so he better stop sniffing‚Äù and Daddy is like ‚Äúyeah, he seems like a fortune hunter and my baby can only marry for love‚Äù and The Smoke Show is like ‚Äúno, she can marry a fortune hunter, I just get to choose which one‚Äù and RD is like ‚Äúwait what?‚Äù and she‚Äôs like ‚Äúhow are you going to save your business? because our daughter needs a fortune for people to hunt‚Äù and he‚Äôs like ‚ÄúI have a plan but like I said before, it might cost us everything‚Äù and she‚Äôs like ‚ÄúI already told you I still have the farm girl clothes, do you want me to put it on and we can get kinky?‚Äù and he‚Äôs like ‚Äúhonestly that nightgown had me ready since like 5 minutes ago but your words have made it urgent, let‚Äôs bang!‚Äù

[ü•µ](https://i.redd.it/uh0c49y2iunf1.gif)

In another part of town we check in on The Gays of The Gilded Age and they too have just engaged in banging because while they have put their chonies back on (boo! where is the NUDITY?! this is HBO!), Oscar is smoking which is universal old timey code for a post coital interaction. Mr. Adams is like ‚Äúwhy so glum babe? I pulled some of your favorite tricks during the pickle tickle, did you not like it?‚Äù and Oscar is like ‚Äúno, I am thinking about the girl I want to marry and since I am gay I have to be like pensive and reflective instead of overjoyed but I am still actually kind of excited. You knew we would always have to find a beard eventually right?‚Äù and John makes a face like he‚Äôs never thought about women ever‚Ä¶he knows they exist but he just doesn‚Äôt ever think about them so he asks ‚Äúwho is this bitch I have to be jealous about?‚Äù and Oscar is like ‚Äúoh I can‚Äôt tell you that because yet because the way you said that seems like you are going to sabotage it. But this girl is an heiress and she‚Äôs so sheltered she‚Äôd walk right into this trap I am setting without realizing it! its the perfect solution to my life problems‚Äù and John is like ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt have problems because you are the heir to a sizable fortune yourself, anyway what about me? do you expect me to just be your side piece?‚Äù and Oscar is like ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

To Wall Street we go and the camera pans up the side of Daddy‚Äôs office so we are reminded how successful he is with a whole ass building that tall, inside Mr. Smooth Voice is reading news off of a ticker tape. Railroad Daddy comes in and is like ‚Äúdid they screw us?‚Äù and SV is like ‚ÄúHARD. the most uncomfortable banging of all time‚Äù and RD is like ‚Äúthat‚Äôs ok because i had the good kind of banging last night with the absolute smoke show I am married to...‚Äù and SV is like ‚Äúawkward, we are working I don‚Äôt want to hear about your sex life‚Ä¶anyway what should we do?‚Äù and RD is like ‚ÄúBUY BUY BUY! Ruin me to artificially inflate the value of my company, let‚Äôs fuck these guys right back‚Äù and SV says ‚Äúaye aye, captain‚Äù and bounds out of the room. A new employee comes into the room and RD is like ‚Äúhello there stenographer! it‚Äôs a beautiful day!!‚Äù and she‚Äôs like ‚Äúand you look GOOOOOOOD, damn you so fine, but why are you so happy?‚Äù and he‚Äôs like ‚Äúyou know me, I am happiest when I am spanking asses‚Äù and she‚Äôs like ‚ÄúI wish you would spank mine‚Äù and he is like ‚Äúwhat was that?‚Äù and she‚Äôs like ‚Äúerr, you can do it sir!‚Äù

A new location and out comes the Unstable Shyster that Agnes told her niece to stay away from but we pan out to see that stubborn ass niece and her only friend waiting to see him. He sees her and is thinking *thank god her aunt is against me because this makes things easier* but he‚Äôs like ‚Äúwhat a surprise to find you here!‚Äù and she‚Äôs like ‚ÄúOh I was just accompanying Pretty Peggy to your meeting on my way to my own meeting!‚Äù and he‚Äôs like ‚Äústep in to my office so we can flirt a bit before you head back‚Äù and  Peggy gives them both a look that says *white people are so reckless and dumb but I inexplicably support Marian so go on* and the two dummies head into the office. Marian is like ‚Äúoh my god we are unchaperoned in this office! Was that the reason behind the look Peggy just gave me?! I should go‚Äù and he‚Äôs like ‚ÄúI just need a minute to plant the seeds into your head‚Äù and she‚Äôs like ‚Äúhuh?‚Äù and he‚Äôs like ‚Äúsince you can‚Äôt stay we should meet for lunch! let me prattle off a half dozen locations you have never heard of‚Äù and she‚Äôs like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre right, I don‚Äôt know any of these, I've lived here for months and you only a few days but you are like Mr. NYC?‚Äù and he‚Äôs like ‚Äúhow about a tryst in a hotel! for coffee of course‚Äù and she‚Äôs like ‚Äúof course not!‚Äù and he‚Äôs like ‚Äúaww you‚Äôre a boring rule following prude!‚Äù and she‚Äôs like ‚Äúum NO, I am Little Miss Stubborn!!! but also a pragmatist about my reputation because I am a woman, so its actually dumb for me to be in this office, I should go!‚Äù and he‚Äôs like ‚Äúlet‚Äôs casually run into each other in public like it‚Äôs not planed! I‚Äôll be by the hand of the statue that France is making for America next Monday, I hope to see you there‚Äù she responds with a signature Fellowes line a little less convincingly than Michelle Dockery delivered it when it was in her script (but I mean, Michelle was *that girl* in her turn as Lady Mary so that‚Äôs a tough act to follow) and flies out of the office.

[then like, stay away from him?](https://preview.redd.it/gn8pr3z0nunf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=65ddef7f82a7e7667a9c232e2651116f2e59eaca)

New location and we see Mr. Stinkface power walking like he‚Äôs barefoot on coals but he wants people to think he‚Äôs a big strong man. He bursts into an office and at the desk is literally a guy who looks like a Ken doll has come to life and Greta Gerwig really missed a casting opportunity for the Barbie movie. Mr. S is like ‚ÄúOH MY GOD DID YOU SEE THE TICKER TAPE? IS IT FUCKING TRUUUUUE?‚Äù and Anthropomorphic Ken is like ‚ÄúYeah, our plan is not doing so hot and the stock price is going in the opposite direction but that surly can‚Äôt last forever because Railroad Daddy is obviously behind this and eventually he will ruin himself before he can ruin us‚Äù and Mr. S is like ‚Äúare you sure because I am going to put a gun in my mouth if you‚Äôre wrong‚Äù and AK is like ‚ÄúBET‚Äù On his way out of Anthropomorphic Ken‚Äôs office, Mr. S runs in to Agnes‚Äô bitch ass son (I like Oscar, but if he‚Äôs trying to dupe My Girlie into marriage he‚Äôs a punk ass bitch) and Oscar is like ‚Äúhey Morris, you good?‚Äù and Mr. S says ‚Äúyeah I was just having a meeting with your cousin‚Äôs husband‚Äù and Oscar is like ‚ÄúI heard at my very eXcLuSiVe club, the Union, which will be a hot location on this show that George Russell is about to lose it all?‚Äù and Mr. S is like ‚Äúyeah totally, he‚Äôs doing crazy stock market tricks and it‚Äôs not going to work‚Äù and Oscar is like ‚ÄúDAMN, I better start looking for a new heiress‚Äù and Mr. S is like ‚ÄúI hope I am doing this manifesting shit correctly‚Äù

[You did this to yourself though?](https://i.redd.it/nwk7k0phlunf1.gif)

Back to the cozy servant‚Äôs hall and Pretty Peggy is reading a letter. Mrs. Gambler is fussing over her because she is MOTHER downstairs and she cares about Peggy most of all since she helped her keep her job. We pan out to see this is just the ladies, Jack and Bannister are no where to be seen. Pretty Peggy gasps at her letter and Mrs. G is like ""girl, SPILL THE TEA"" and Peggy is like ""its from the editor or the very white, very religious, Religious Propagandist paper and he wants to publish my short stories!"" and Little Red is like ""oh my god I can't wait to read them! it's so cool to know a real author!"" and Bigoted Lady's Maid is like ""you can't even read you illiterate trollop!"" and LR is like ""I can read well enough! but not well enough that I know what those words mean"" Mrs. G butts in loudly over both of them and says to PP ""I am so excited for you!"" then the bigot groans and Mrs. G turns to her and says ""keep your fucking mouth shut or I will sew it closed"" and she turns back to PP and gives her a big warm smile. Just then the men show up and Bannister is like ""men hungry! feed us!"" but the ladies (except for the bigot of course) want to gush about PP's big news. Peggy is so fueled by the news she excuses herself and runs off without eating, Jack pipes up to say ""that's exciting for her but even more exciting for me is I got a hot date tonight with Little Red!"" and LR is like ""not hot, not a date, just a thing we are going to do simultaneously and I'm coming home as soon as it's over""

We are in the dining room of Girl Cousin's house and seriously, was this place a church before it became a private residence? Anyway its Aurora, THE Caroline Webster Schermerhorn Astor, Mrs. Stinkface, Cornelius Eckworthlessington III, Spinster Sister and Little Miss Stubborn eating a small plate of food but drinking large goblets of red wine in the middle of the day. Aurora says they need to like make their Red Cross support political and everyone agrees but then Marian is like ""like the suffragettes!"" and everyone clutches their pearls. So CEIII uses this as an opportunity to size up the fish he wants to catch and asks Ada all these questions about her life, she mostly talks about her sister's life because as a spinster...she didn't really have a life of her own...this is where we learn Agnes' feckless husband at least has good foresight with real estate investments and he's been dead for a decade. Then CEIII is like ""so can I call on you for like tea or something?"" and Little Miss Stubborn is like ""YES THAT WOULD BE GREAT!"" and Mrs. Astor thinks this conversation is boring because she is supposed to be the center of attention so she starts talking about how the Upstart Platoon of the Morgans, Rockefellers, and Vanderbilts are colluding to open a new opera house since Old Money wont give them boxes at the Academy of Music. So then Marian wants to be stubborn and says ""well those guys are rich as fuck, just like my favorite neighbors the Russells and will probably build an opera that will make your house look like a school pageant if you don't just let them in, so why not just give them boxes?"" and everyone once again looks at her like she should be in the loony bin. So of course she wants to push more because of the stubbornness but Ada knocks her down and when Ada thinks you're out of line, you shut the fuck up.

[üò¨](https://i.redd.it/0qo16cwllunf1.gif)

Back to the cozy servant‚Äôs hall and Pretty Peggy is doing some writing in her note book, Bannister comes in and is like ‚Äúthis is awkward but someone tried to use the front door to see you instead of the servant‚Äôs entrance so I told him to wait outside and he said he‚Äôd rather wait at Central Park‚Äù and Pretty Peggy is now Puzzled Peggy. We follow her to the park where she sees the man and Puzzled Peggy is now Perturbed Peggy because the man is her father whom we established two episodes back is not her favorite person. He‚Äôs like ‚ÄúI realized you think the ferry only runs one way so I had to take it to see you since you won‚Äôt come home‚Äù and she goes to rebut but some bigots are walking by and think the Scotts should move out of their path instead of them going around the Scotts because their insides are so rotten that they don‚Äôt even have a brain, zombie ass bitches. Anyway they move out of the way and Peggy‚Äôs Papa says that it‚Äôs her Mama‚Äôs birthday coming up and Peggy isn‚Äôt mad at her mom so she should come home to celebrate with them and then he dumbly says he can forgive her for what she did which is not something you should say when whatever the fight is about is the reason she doesn‚Äôt want to see you? Anyway she has the exact reaction I thought she would have and is like ‚Äúforgive ME?! You need to find jesus or something. I will come home for my mama and *only* my mama and only for the day because I am a very busy and employed woman‚Äù and he's like ""employed doing what? scribbling notes for a white septuagenarian?"" and she's like ""well that AND I have an offer to possibly write for the *Religious Propagandist* newspaper"" and he's like ""more white people stuff, you couldn't even try to write for the black paper?"" and she's like ""they didn't want me, I tried"" and he's like ""this will end badly so just come home and work for me"" and Pretty Puzzled Perturbed Peggy rolls her eyes so far back she almost passes out and she says goodbye.

To the stuffy servant's hall of Russell Manor, Mr. Watson is holding a paper but he's not reading it, he's kind of creepily watching the Troublemaker while she's darning something. She notices and his not flattered, so he looks into his paper then announces he's going out. Once he leaves Housekeeper turns to the Troublemaker and says ""so are you going to get in on that? he's obviously interested"" and the Troublemaker starts to gag and says ""my plans involve homewrecking for money...the valet doesn't have a home to wreck or money to provide, so no.""

Little Miss Stubborn and Spinster Sister are walking home from their luncheon and of course LMS is being as stubborn as stubborn can be and says ""we need money for this charity and our neighbor has tons, I still don't understand why we can't ask her to donate!

Back to Girl Cousin's house and I guess this is their library or study? the doors on these bookshelves are beautiful so here I am envious while I write that Anthropomorphic Ken is explaining to his wife that the pep talk he tried to give Mr. Stinkface was bullshit and they are truly fucked and about to possibly loose the gorgeous bookshelves along with everything else in their home, even the home itself because the alderman tried to humiliate Railroad Daddy and Girl Cousin is not amused, but then Ken tries to throw it back on her and say this is her fault for humiliating the So Far Failed Socialite. Like, what? Why are men like this? Stop deflecting blame and take your spanking like a man!!!

The date night has finally arrived! Jack and Little Red are at a theater watching the Magic Lantern show. The music is lively, the audience is engage and Little Red seems to be having a good time, she even casually looks over at her date with a very curious look about her that would lead you to believe she's got a little crush maybe? But then things take a turn because he goes to show her physical affection and she shuts it down and clams up quick.

[üò©](https://i.redd.it/33mhxofzeunf1.gif)

Our check in with the date is cut too short because we have to watch Mr. Stinkface cry about how he fucked up his whole life but just like Anthropomorphic Ken is going to take the Worthlessington route and blame his wife. ""You got to go lick whatever Mrs. Russell wants you to lick to get us out of this!"" and she's like ""are you fucking mental? there is no way you can expect me to do that?"" and he's like ""I don't just expect it, I am pulling the patriarchal dominance card and I am commanding your ass to crawl over there right now!!!"" and her Resting Stinkface looks like she's actively inhaling the scent of her own vomit.

[he really had some of the best facial expressions in this episode](https://preview.redd.it/ujh5v5lulunf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0d345bd017f0a79b9c9f8451f095b5779afcd52)

Back to the date and they are leaving the show. Jack tries another approach to woo her and asks if they can go out for a sweet treat or just chat over some coffee before going home and Little Red is like ""I am going to be goody two shoes about this and remind you that we have a curfew"" and he's like ""its not like they will fire us and start pouring their own tea or peeling their own potatoes...we can take a little extra break, we deserve it!"" and she's walking so quickly she's already 5 blocks away.

Checking in with The Gays and Boy Cousin is pouring himself a huge glass of whisky. Mr. Adams is like ""what's wrong now babe? we should be banging by now"" and Oscar is like ""I have to withdraw my bid for duping an innocent girl into a loveless lavender marriage because her father won't have money for a dowery after all"" and John is like ""so the companionship and respectability of a 'traditional' marriage isn't enough?"" and Oscar is like ""of course not, I am only doing this because I am fucking greedy!""

We are in a new location and there are portraits of white men on the wall, then we see white men sitting next to each other, one is reading the paper the other is side eying the person to the opposite side of him then the camera pans so we can see that person is Pretty Peggy who once again has to navigate a world with cringey racists everywhere (Peggy is so graceful, I am a Black woman myself and I know my ass would have been killed at a very young age if I lived in this time period) The assistant for Mr. Carlton >!any relation to Billy the coward?!!< comes out and is like ""what the fuck? you never said you were...well...I mean..."" and PP is like ""I think Mr. Carlton was expecting a female author so here I am"" and the ASSistant is like ""but like, a white one because its a white paper"" and Patient Peggy is like ""God loves all his people and y'all literally just preached equality in the last issue that I read as a non white avid reader"" and the ASSistant is like ""have a seat, I'm going to waste your whole day"" and calls one of the dusty ass white men back instead.

Back to Russell Manor and Daddy's home from work, he asks the butler where his boss babe of a wife is and he says ""That Stinkface lady turned up and they are in the drawing room"" and RD is like ""oooh I won't disturb them but maybe I'll eavesdrop from my office."" The So Far Failed Socialite is playing dumb with Mrs. S and says ""you want little old me to tell my husband what to do at work?!"" and Mrs. S is trying SO HARD to have a pleasant look on her face but you can tell she's had little practice at it so instead she's awkwardly giggling between her pleas, SFFS ain't buying shit so she drops the innocent act because she realizes she's got the upper hand and says ""why exactly are you asking me for a favor when you've done nothing but demean and belittle me?"" and that stunned Stinkface into silence, so SFFS gets up and rings the little bell and when the footman comes in she's like ""please escort this bitch out of my house""

Back to Patient Peggy who is now the only person in the waiting room of the *Religious Propagandist* and the ASSistant comes over to tell her that the boss is finally ready for her. Now I would say this is the most demeaning and humiliating experience someone has on this episode but I've seen the whole thing and I know it only gets worse. Mr. Carlton first questions if Peggy could even be as talented of a writer as the stories he read suggests so he accuses her of fraud, then he tells her that they have to change her stories to be about white people because we need to appease the dusty ass racists in the South (they lost the war guys! show them who is boss) then he tells her that she will have to sign a waiver saying she will never tell anyone she's the same Peggy Scott that writes the stories in this paper but its ok because she's going to make hella bank and Pretty Peggy is like ""I am not Marian, I can't just lie like that.""

Marian is now with Peggy and she tells her that she made the right choice ""Even me, a certified liar thinks that is a bridge too far! But its not like this is the only paper in the city! you'll find another one"" But their conversation dies out because they have to admire another wonderful CGI masterpiece, this time it's Liberty's Hand and now we know they are going to meet up with the Unstable Shyster. He asks Peggy if she wants to chaperone their walk around the park and Peggy is like ""I am not really about that third wheel life"" So the two of them take a turn around the park and he's like ""I'd love to come to tea and tell you all about my life but your aunt still is against that?"" and she's like ""she was barely for it the first time"" and he thinks *sweet, this girl is so stubborn if I give her a reason to defy her aunt she'll eat it up!* and just like that he fucking proposes to her. Marian is like ""um, we've met like 5 times"" and he's like ""but you're definitely not against the idea and now I will leave you mid adrenaline rush so that you can confuse excitement with love"" Peggy runs over and is like ""are you ok you look like you're going to faint but like in a happy way?"" and Marian is like ""HE PROPOSED!?!""

[so realistic!](https://preview.redd.it/3tldg7cfmunf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b57fac094311815508a5d9958d41a414dbea97a)

At her Aunt's house Cornelius Eckworthlessington III has called for that tea and he's trying to be chummy with Agnes but if there is one thing my girl can do, its sniff out a rat. For once Pumpkin and Agnes are on the same side because when he goes to pet Pumpkin, he gives a low growl. Agnes kicks her sister out so she can tell this asshole off and she does. He's like ""oh your sister was the one who got away! she's so beautiful and fun and intelligent and I am so happy to see..."" and Agnes is like ""shut the fuck up. You tried to pick up my sister decades ago and my Papa said no because you were obviously a fortune hunter, and now you are lonely and no doubt broke so you think you can pick her up again and that I will fund it? In your dreams loser. You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here...get the fuck out of my house!!!"" Ada comes back in with the tea for their tea party and the man is already moving so fast his feet look like Sonic the Hedgehog. Ada is sad but Agnes has spent her entire life trying to protect this woman, she knows exactly how to redirect her focus and she does.

[you got lucky my dear](https://i.redd.it/2ni51er5funf1.gif)

To Daddy's office and he's lounging in his big boss chair Infront of the fireplace looking very smug and dare I say sexy as hell. He's all like ""why are you guys asking me to stop doing a very legal thing?"" and the camera turns to reveal a gaggle of middle aged white men, led by Anthropomorphic Ken and Mr. Stinkface. Ken is like ""dude just be a guy's guy for like a few minutes would you?"" and Railroad Daddy is like ""why do you guys always expect what you aren't willing to give in return?!"" and Mr. S is like ""but what if we like clear the way for you to have your station after all?! we could just like, make you happy that way?"" and RD is like ""did you already promise me this and fucking renege on the deal? why should I trust you?"" and Ken is like ""how about if we tell you that you have clearly proven to be smarter than all of us put together? We could put on dunce caps and everything"" and RD smirks and shrugs but Mr. S starts to panic so he gets down on his knees and is like ""I will literally do anything, I could just kneel here and you could put it in my mouth? You said earlier that I would end up begging for the privilege to shine your shoes...so here I am, I don't have any shoe polish with me, do you think your secretary might have some to spare?"" and RD is like ""look pleb, y'all tried to beat me at a game I was never going to lose, that was stupid enough, but then you let your wives make my smoking hot sugar plum fairy of a dream girl feel like a failure and I will take any chance to destroy someone who makes my baby feel bad. The door is over there""

We follow Mr. Stinkface home and the BEST song on The Gilded Age soundtrack is playing so you know drama is coming (the song is called A Hostage to Ridicule on the S1 soundtrack if you're interested) and he's walking very slow because he knows he fucked up bad and the footman who opened the door for him is about to lose his job and the house that the beautiful door is attached to will have to be sold. He tries to skulk away undetected but Mrs. S hears him come in and he's one of the two people her face can make relaxed smiles for, she's like ""lets chat and make googly eyes at each other in the drawing room before the children stop by for a free meal, they won't stay after because they are too cool for us now"" and he's like ""I love our kids, and I love you, and I love this house, and I love everything ever"" and she's like ""ok weirdo, i love you too, lets hang out!"" but she doesn't insist on it and she probably should have. Anyway he heads upstairs and the scene cuts to Russell Manor and The Russells are having champagne in tacky colored flutes in their drawing room, celebrating the fact that Railroad Daddy spanked those asses hard and prevailed, but the ominous music is still building so their celebration is probably going to be short lived. RD is talking about how benevolent he is and that he'll probably let the aldermen off with enough to at least recover to their starting point, unfortunately Patrick Morris didn't get to find that bit out because the big bang the show ends on was not the fun and sexy kind...he literally blew his brains out.

Here‚Äôs the twist: instead of some smooth ‚Äúlean in,‚Äù he just blurted out ‚ÄúCan I kiss you?‚Äù I literally froze, panicked, and said ‚Äúuh‚Ä¶ yeah?‚Äù like the most awkward human alive. He laughed nervously, then actually kissed me.

Now I‚Äôm sitting here overthinking everything. Was it just a heat-of-the-moment thing? Does this mean he likes me for real? Am I supposed to text him first now??

I just feel like golf, video games, ect take priority over our time. 

My husband just got back from a bachelor trip‚Ä¶mind you I‚Äôm three months postpartum and also have a 20 month old. Anyway we discussed it and decided the trip was fine: 4 days, 3 nights and trip was only golf/fishing/drinking no stripclubs, ect as I already told him this would piss me off especially just having had a baby. I rarely texted or called him during the trip‚Ä¶gave him his space and never complained about how much he spent/drank just told him to let me know when he made it back at nights. The day he gets back I ask if he wants to go out that night for a drink or two so we can catch up and I can hear all about it. Also I‚Äôve been with two kids for four days, haven‚Äôt slept through the night once and really just want adult conversation. He says no, that he‚Äôs too tired and needs to cut the grass. Whatever. I‚Äôm fine with that, shortly after getting home he goes to cut the grass, throws some steaks on the grill we eat dinner and he ends up falling asleep early. I stay up put baby to bed then fall asleep. I wake up early the next morning (like 5am which is rare) and he‚Äôs not in bed‚Ä¶I get up thinking maybe he was in the bathroom but he‚Äôs downstairs playing video games. Whatever we were all asleep so no big deal.

So now I‚Äôm pissed‚Ä¶I leave and go back upstairs‚Ä¶eventually he comes up doesn‚Äôt say anything and puts our show on. AITAH for wanting him to make spending time together more of a priority? He later tells me it‚Äôs the only time he has to himself where he can game and I‚Äôm like are you serious? You were just gone four days. You don‚Äôt get more me time right now. The next night I decide I‚Äôm waking him when baby gets up. I never do because I always feel like with breastfeeding it‚Äôs easier for me to just get up. So next night she‚Äôs up at 4:30am. I had already gotten up with our other daughter and baby had already been up once. Now I shake my husband and I‚Äôm like umm the baby‚Äôs up. He completely loses it‚Ä¶grabs the baby and goes downstairs yelling at me that he works in two hours and slamming doors. Now I‚Äôm scared to even leave the baby with him. Should I not have woken him or am completely overthinking this? He‚Äôs like why are you waking me up now when I‚Äôve offered to help with baby in the past? And I‚Äôm like well you can be up at 5 am to play video games so now you can be up to help with baby. ",5,1757298901.0,AITAH,9,1.0,False

I could read this book 20 times and find something new every time. There were a lot of clues that I ignored because I wanted to get to the story, but it‚Äôs chock full of puzzles, codes, and passages that turn into pictures of words. I felt lost in a maze, particularly during exploration 4. 

After completing, I have more questions than thoughts. Is the house real? How reliable is Johnny? Sometimes his stories and visions sound exactly like what the characters go through in the Navidson Project. Did he make it all up, including Zampan√≥? It honestly feels like I haven‚Äôt really finished the book.

I was worried that finishing the book would make me feel depressed. I did not see things ending well for Johnny, or for Navidson and Karen, but after Johnny‚Äôs scene at the Flagstaff, and Navidson‚Äôs conclusion to the record I‚Äôm relieved the protagonists made it through and found a bit of peace.

This book deserves a proper read through accompanied with a notebook and a pot of coffee, but I‚Äôll have to buy my own copy before that happens (this one is from the library). Easily the most mind boggling book I‚Äôve read. Bravo Danielewski.

I would love to hear anybody‚Äôs first impression after finishing their first read through, or how it‚Äôs changed since re-reading.

Added the water, did a slight swirl, steeped for 4 minutes and thirty seconds. Swirled again to break the crust, and let sit for another 2 minutes. Then I pressed the plunger gently to the bottom. 

The coffee came out more bitter than anticipated, so I‚Äôm assuming that I need to increase the grind size. Seems to be a good place to start. However, it was a decent cup of coffee. I did add 1 tablespoon of heavy cream to tame the bitterness.

1nbbvfi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1nbbvfi/the_old_lady_next_door_might_have_drugged_my_cat/,The old lady next door might have drugged my cat,"It's 3 in the morning and I can't sleep.

For the past hour or so I've been laying in bed trying to ignore the soft, frantic scrabbling of tiny claws with an occasional thump mixed in. These noises are a little easier to ignore than the muffled sobbing coming through the wall from the apartment next door. God, I hope that's not because of me.

Sweet Pea has never been the most energetic cat. She's usually curled up in front of the hall closet napping, when she isn't giving me judgmental stares from around a doorway. I don't know how such a small creature can be so haughty, somehow looking down a nose only four inches from the floor. She didn't even run around the place when we first moved in a couple of months ago. Something must have happened to her today, and I think I might know what it was.

Earlier today when I had just gotten home from work I found the door unlocked. Inside I found a diminutive older woman who appeared to be dressed as a rodeo clown's lawyer crouching down over Sweet Pea with a small plastic bag of handmade treats. I'm sure to most people something like that might be shocking, an event that joins the reliable old party stories like ""The time I thought my dog was a pile of laundry"" for decades to come, but for me it was just Thursday. My landlord Ruth has a little issue with boundaries. 

She's the kind of woman who, in theory, might be lovely to be around in tiny doses. She brings over trays of delicious homemade pastries and cookies that always seem to disappear faster than you think should be possible. She listens to you talk with eyes open wide, bulging behind her thick rhinestone rimmed glasses, heart open even wider.

But it was the third time this week I had come home to find her in my apartment. The third time this week a surprise social interaction was sprung on me when all I wanted to do was kick off my Customer Service Voice at the door and not think about how one day a robot will be able talk to people better than I do.

""Goddamnit Ruth, why are you here when I'm not?""

She jolted upright with a cry like an extinct bird's mating call, knocking the single dining room chair over with her prodigious backside. Sweet Pea tore out of the kitchen like her ass was on fire, bringing down a tower of old pizza boxes in an uncontrolled demolition. Ruth sheepishly kicked a couple of pizza bones into a pile and swiped surprisingly steady hands down the front of her neon fuchsia pantsuit as she hit me with the full force of her $50,000 smile. The cacophonous rattling of her many plastic arm bangles was drowned out by her voice, as soft as a buzzsaw and twice as loud.

""Oh darling I thought I would just poke my head in and tidy up a tad, and then I couldn't just not say hello to Sweet Pea! Oh isn't she just a darling you know I had one just like her except he only had three legs, this was way back in, oh, yes I think it was-""

""You can't keep coming in here when I'm not home, Ruth.""

""Well why not? It's my gosh darn building! I'm here offering my services at no extra charge, to boot! I cook, I clean, I'm pretty nifty with a screwdriver and hammer, I can conversate with the best of 'em! Heck, just the other day-""

""It's against the law?""

""The law!"" She threw her head back and cackled deeply, lime green fingernails clutching at her midsection as she leaned back against the sink. ""Well according to Johnny Law you're just a friend who stays over a lot and helps with the light bill sometimes! I know you don't mean it anyhow, you know if you tell me to get out I'll just up and skedaddle! Come on now Jack, I'm just trying to make a connection. You like me, dont you, Jack? I just want to help my tenants, what's so gosh darn bad about that? Look, the sink is absolutely crawling with ants, this place could sure as heckfire use a woman's touch every now and then!""

I stormed over to the faucet and opened the hot water handle full blast, swiftly and decisively washing the horde of tiny, squirming bugs down the drain. In a way, I felt bad for them. They were just living their little lives, oblivious that in an instant I would decide to wash it all away. Ruth was silent as I enacted my ant genocide and when I turned around afterwards she wore a strange expression I couldn't place on her pinched, leathery face. I thought I was being a bit harsh at the time, but sometimes you kind of have to be to get your damn alone time.

""There, no more ants. No more ants, no more Ruth. Get the fuck out. Please.""

If I had hurt her feelings she recovered quickly, once again blinding me with a smile far too big for her face. Getting hit with that at point blank is like realizing the light at the end of the tunnel is the reflection of your flashlight on a sleek metal cowcatcher bearing down on you.

""I can tell you're having a tough day darling so I'll get out of your hair, the last thing I want is you closing yourself off to me like some of the other tenants. I'll be back another time when you're ready to grab a bag and a broom! Please give Sweet Pea my love, and tell her she's the prettiest most-"" 

Sometimes you have to end her sentences for her so I cut her off there with a winning smile of my own, one forged through many years of serving the public. For maximum effect I squinted my eyes the same way she did. Most people subconsciously enjoy being mirrored, it makes them feel like they're not alone. 

""Okay, thanks Ruth, bye!"" I shouted as I shooed her away from the door and finally she began trundling her way to the elevator. Her thick, square heels portend her looming approach and I pictured the townspeople shuttering their shades in fear that she may darken their doorstep.

Before I could flee to the safety of my nest I turned around to see my neighbor from the other side of the apartment, Darla. Though she had a smirk on her mousey face and a bottle of whiskey in her hands I could also see that her little black tee shirt was inside out and her mascara was running.

""Hey Jagoff. I see you just survived Hurricane Ruth, wanna forget your troubles?"" 

She tilted her head and looked up at me with bright blue eyes that were swimming as her chipped nails played a beat on the glass bottle. I knew that turning her down would just have her crying and throwing things at the wall all night and I was so tired I almost did anyways. I figured with any luck, she would be passed out on the couch in twenty minutes and I could finally get to relaxing.

Today is just not my lucky day.

If she had any comments about the state of my apartment she mercifully kept them to herself, collapsing into the couch like a crumbling ruin as she eagerly unscrewed the bottle. We didn't talk much, thankfully, merely passing the bottle back and forth as we stared blankly at the flickering glow of the TV. Something was clearly bothering her but she didn't want to say, and I didn't want to ask. In a way, it was nice to let all of my thoughts slide out of my head like a cracked egg and just exist.

Eventually, the bottle ran dry. Then the unopened bottle of rum I had stashed in the back of the cabinet ran dry, too. I don't remember what we said as she stumbled out the door. As my hand fell from the knob and I turned around I thought I saw her keyring sitting on the coffee table.

In retrospect, perhaps the way I threw open the door was a bit dramatic, but whatever I had been planning to say was shocked out of me when I saw Darla was still standing there. I turned to look inside to restart my train of thought but the bare top of the table gave me nothing. In hindsight, I had probably been looking at a giant cockroach with my bleary eyes the first time. When I turned back to look at her my swimming mind once again struggled to convey anything. It's supposed to be my job to communicate with people, it was downright shameful.

Whatever I had been trying to communicate, she got a different signal. I won't bore you with the details, for my sake more than yours. The only pertinent ones are that it was unfortunately short, I'm a bit out of practice it seems, and that she was never out of my sight the whole time. Well, we both had our eyes closed for most of it, but you get what I mean. She was probably thinking of someone else, too.

When we were finished I made the worst mistake of all, I tried to be funny.

""Hey, try not to forget your keys this time.""

I think I was setting up some lame pun but I never got that far. She burst into tears and immediately started grabbing her clothes, turning her face away as I tried to explain.

""No, wait, I wasn't saying you should leave. I just-""

She cut me off with a harsh hand gesture, still facing away. Her reply came in a warbling, artificially cheery voice.

""No, no, I know that. I just suddenly remembered s-something and I have to go check on it right now.""

She sniffled loudly and pulled her clothes on with jerky motions, slowly making her way towards the door. Just before she walked out she turned and did her level best at a smile that looked like a chalk sidewalk drawing in a downpour.

""This was... um... nice. Maybe we can hang another time. Sorry I made it so weird.""

She was out the door before I could correct her, and it wasn't a full minute before I heard her softly crying through the wall.

It was getting pretty late by that point so I filled up Sweet Pea's bowl, only briefly stopping to note that she hadn't immediately come sauntering up to judge me through half-lidded eyes, and headed to bed. I should have probably checked her litter box but I was exhausted, and had a pretty good idea that Ruth had made it her first stop.

I haven't seen Sweet Pea all night since I caught Ruth feeding her homemade treats.

Suddenly, a blood curdling scream echoes through the wall, followed by several impacts of smashing glass. I it up motionless in bed for long seconds, struggling to listen for any signs of life over the maddening scrabbling coming from my kitchen. My heart races a mile a minute as I slowly climb out of bed, taking a step towards the wall I shared with Darla. I almost jump clear out of my skin when a crashing sound rings out from my kitchen.

Sweet Pea must have knocked over a mug.

I cross the distance to the wall swiftly, leaving behind a string of mumbled curses I'd rather not repeat here. I press my ear to the wall to listen for signs of life from next door but that only seems to amplify the frantic scratching sounds, the wall somehow picking up the vibrations. Eventually I hear the sobbing pick up again and I breathe a sigh of relief. I'm not going to say she's okay, but at least she's alive over there.

The door to my bedroom makes a soft clicking noise when I turn the handle and the scratching sounds immediately stop. Swallowing hard I open the door and slowly step into the silent stillness. I had forgotten to turn the TV off and the input screen bathes the room in a cool blue, casting harsh shadows across discarded cardboard and half empty plastic bags. The room is as still as you always hope a grave will be.

The compressor in the AC kicks on and a small styrofoam cup clatters to the floor, making my eyes dart to the sink. On the floor below the tiny white cup lazily rolls back and forth in a small field of shiny ceramic shards. The air from the vent must have knocked over the styrofoam, but the mug?

Sweet Pea knows better than to run around on the counter.

I'm tempted to leave the mess for later but I know I'll be stepping in it when I make my morning coffee, plus it could be dangerous to the eight pound cat that lives in the bottom half-foot of my apartment.

I was walking past the sink to grab the broom when I heard the light creak of a stealthy step on a loose laminate floor tile. When I turn to look I see a dark shape dart out of view under the couch and instinctively take a step back, holding in a scream by biting my lip almost as deep as the shards of my favorite mug bite into my heel. The mess can wait, I need to get ahold of that goddamned cat before she gives me a heart attack.

I want to go pluck the broken chunks of ceramic in the bathroom but for some reason I can't bring myself to walk past the sofa.

""Sweet Pea? Come on girl, come out.""

I feel stupid calling to her like that, especially as the silence that answered hangs heavily in the air. She's as likely to come when I call as she is to climb up onto my lap, we just don't have that kind of relationship. I hoped that at least she would move or something, give me some indication that she was alive.

Anxiety digs it's long fingers deep into the back of my skull and squeezes my mind tight as I struggle to dismiss the dark thoughts hemming me in. She's just acting weird. Maybe she caught that roach I saw earlier and doesn't want to talk with her mouth full. Maybe the mug had landed on her head and she lay dying under the couch right now, grey sludge trickling down the sides of her tiny face as she watches what's supposed to be her caretaker tremble in fear and do nothing.

I take a deep breath in to calm my nerves, and almost immediately I can feel the grip of anxiety loosen. Being careful not to bump the shrapnel in my heel I slowly lower myself to the floor to peer underneath the couch. I should have turned on the light, it's pitch black under there and cluttered with old plastic wrappers and long lost socks. 

Jesus, I need to clean up a bit sometime. I know it's been getting bad, I know I have to clean it up at some point, but I just never seem to have the energy. Putting on the Fake Smile Voice all day to deal with entitled rich assholes is exhausting, by the time I get home I just want to sink into the sofa and forget about the day.

Crawling towards the couch on my hands and knees I think I see movement so I lean down and stick my arm under, turning my face away to reach further towards the back. As my fingers probe into dusty cobwebs and forgotten pieces of discarded food I think I hear a rustle and call out to her again.

""Getting real tired of this, Pea."" 

She responds with a soft growling whine, somehow coming from in front of me. I turn my head and see her tense body crouched in the darkness under the coffee table. Did she sneak around behind me when I was bending down to reach under the couch?

Before I can react she thunders past my face like a woolly freight train, scattering trash and stray hairs like a smoke bomb. She streaks down the hall and around the corner, yowling and hissing the whole way. I hear her collide with a door as I shoot to my feet, ignoring the searing pain in my heel to sprint after her as the sounds of her own struggle intensify. I round the corner to the sound of a dull thud that precludes a heavy silence and come to a sudden halt.

The door to the hall closet is open.

I don't know how long I was standing there but the thought of Sweet Pea laying on the floor with a broken neck, an accusatory glare with vacant eyes, snaps me out of it and I step into the threshold. The closet looks just as I remember with one small difference. A small cardboard box has fallen off of the shelf and lay slanted in the corner. The side that was labelled is facing away but I don't need to see it to know which box it is. 

I don't even realize I've been slowly backing away until a shard of ceramic embedded in my heel makes contact with the baseboard in the hallway, sending a bright bolt of pain up my spine that snaps me out of my daze. I realize now that the perfect silence has been broken as a low growl emanates from just underneath me.

I can't begin to describe the relief I feel when I look down and see Sweet Pea hunched at my feet staring into the darkness of the hall closet. I swiftly close the closet door and bend down to pick her up, wincing as the pain in my leg begins to really make itself at home. Surprisingly she doesn't complain as I escort her to the bathroom for first aid.

I'm not a Vet but as far as I can tell she has no injuries, save for one small patch of fur missing on her flank. I assume that's from running into the closet door so hard it popped open. Her eyes are clear and alert, and she hasn't had any more episodes the whole time I was pulling shards of coffee cup out of my foot. My best guess is she had a reaction to something in the treat Ruth fed her earlier, God only knows what the hell it's made of, and it seems to have worn off. If I see any other strange behaviors tomorrow I'll get her looked at but for now I'm eager to put this night behind me. On the way out of the bathroom I pause at the hall closet and, without turning to look, gently turn the small lock on the handle.

Maybe Sweet Pea can sleep in my bedroom tonight, just this once.",1,1757298165.0,Odd_directions,1,1.0,False

*prioritizing those who are in Seoul or will be in Seoul this Sept 16 to 21 & can meet me in person. I'll be there as a tourist (my relax trip since I'll be busy again after this) so it doesn't really matter to me if you are a resident or tourist as long as you are willing to commit long term & possibly LDR with me after the said dates. Still open to those who won't be in Seoul during these dates but again will prio those who I can meet in person first.* 

Hi! I'm trying this again after a month long rest from vetting & posting since I realized I had to reevaluate what I'm looking for. 

**The relationship I'm looking for:**
* friendship to dating to marry/exclusive LTR with similar non-sexual & sexual interests. If you don't see yourself commiting to an exclusive long term relationship yet then maybe we won't match. 
* Semi-FLR relationship - just like how Link treats Zelda and vice versa. You'll be my loyal knight & I'll look after you. We protect each other. I see a bit of FLR in our daily lives but away from our careers. **Also, not total FLR & not purely focusing on sexual interests.** Hope to discuss this further in chat :) 

**Get to know me:**
* 29 F, 152cm, single, chubby | plus-size, Asian, brown eyes, and currently have black hair
* living in Asia (GMT +8) 
* I have little scars all over my body (nothing major mostly because of my clumsiness and not due to bdsm/kinks. You can just see them more if you look closely & since I have light skin.)
* gentle domme switch 
* strong personality, introvert, big BIG texter, straightforward
* stable career
* some interests I have: caring for dogs & cats, gaming (currently playing Zelda totk), F1, coffee, exercising, flowers

**The person I'm looking for:**
* 23 to 35 
* must be single male & is looking for friendship to date to marry (if you are in a poly relationship, married, or taken, please don't message me.)
* preferably close with my timezone (1 to 5hrs time difference). Open to other timezones but note that I don't have any plans to relocate to the other side of the world :)
* service top sub | looking for my knight (his queen & her knight)
* someone who loves/ open to plus-size body types 
* hygienic & patience (I'm a bit insecure so hopefully you are patient with me)
* non-smoker & ddf
* preferred (not required): taller & bigger than me | 5'8 and above with a muscular/ lumberjack/rugby body
* consistent in both texting and in real life conversations. You can tell me all about your hobbies, I like listening to what you love.
* emotionally intelligent 
* stable career or on the road to it. 

**NSFW:**
* I'm into facesitting, cunnilingus/ oral, shibari, sensory play
* not into open/poly, findom, sissification, illegal, blood, scating, drugs, smokers, ageplay roleplay 

**If you will message me,**
* don't jump into sexting or sending me nsfw pics, please. I won't do/reciprocate to any sexual acts/advances if I don't know you much.
* don't jump into a dynamic meaning don't call me mistress, mommy, etc immediately 
* have the intention of wanting to be friends with me/get to know me first before moving on to a relationship. 
* know that I like daily consistent texting to build the friendship so hopefully you can give me that 

**Read everything & still would like to message me? Kindly include in your initial message:**
* age, sex, location, physical description (hair, body, eyes, height, etc, whatever you want. Just wanna picture you in my head)
* what hobbies do you have
* how long will you be in Seoul | are you a tourist or resident | when are you free to meet?
* favorite color 

I do appreciate a more meaningful message rather than just a one liner. **Also, no lying. I hate liars** :) 

No hard feelings: I will only reply to the user that I feel will match with me.

Ive progressed very quickly and have run a 5k, 10k trail race (which was brutal) and signed up for a 15k in October and a half in November.  I'm currently going through a Garmin coach plan that has been working OK.  

I always run very early in the morning, just after breakfast and coffee.  This long run was no different, and I started about 45 minutes after having a bagel with pb +jelly and a coffee.  Today, the one thing different was the time I had to start -  right around noon.  Long story short: big mistake.

The run was a planned 1:45 long run with 5 minutes to warm up and cool down. It was cloudy and breezy initially and I felt really good for the first 6 miles or so, but right around 6 and a half miles I started feeling terrible. The sun came out, and it was \*hot\*.  I was keeping myself pretty hydrated as usual and sucking down a gel every 30 minutes. Unfortunately it was much hotter than I am used to running in.  I had to start run/walking.  When I would run I would start to get really weak and couldnt even get my HR above 135 without having to stop and walk after about a quarter mile.  Not out of breath, just woozy.   I drank all 500ml water at with about 20 minutes to go.  

After getting home I drank a bunch of water , laid down for a few minutes to cool off.  Out of curiosity, I went and weighed myself.  I was down almost 8 lbs.  I know losing weight after a very long run is typical - but that seems like a lot.

Long story short is I (accidentally) have both the Timemore Sculptor 078 and 078s on the way but will only keep one. I use the 1zpresso K-ultra every day for espresso and pour over (the wife likes cappuccinos but not super into the hobby). My passion is more into filter coffee and I buy nicer beans for that, but also love an espresso. I‚Äôve grown tired of hand grinding espresso twice (sometimes thrice if I botch my first pull) in the morning. It‚Äôs especially difficult switching my one manual grinder from filter to espresso settings and guessing what grind setting to use. While I love espresso, I‚Äôm not super into the hobby of it, and am generally not looking to improve taste (we‚Äôre both beyond content with the espresso for milk based drinks). I‚Äôm looking for a new grinder to optimize filter as well as convenience. 

My question is, will the 078s be a sufficient upgrade from the K Ultra (for filter) to justify the $700 + convenience of not having to hand grind two doses of espresso? If I keep the S version, I would consider buying the turbo burrs later to up my filter brews. I‚Äôve heard step-less adjustments might be an issue for turbo burrs?  

Or ‚Ä¶ should I simply keep the 078 and keep my K Ultra for espresso (forgoing the additional convenience of an electric grinder for espresso)?

We will be at the Andaz so I figured we could either wander east to Karlin for coffee/breakfast/pastries and then cross up into Hole≈°ovice for shopping and pop back down through Letna Park into New Town for dinner. Or we could do the opposite and head north up to Hole≈°ovice then down to Karlin.

TLDR this is really driven by whether are any not-to-be-missed places for good pastries, coffee or dinner in these neighborhoods üòÇ Everything is very driven by food.

We're doing Alma the night prior for dinner.

So I am 27(M) and she is 22(F). It all started 3 years ago (context does matter) I worked at a restaurant and I met her. I thought was pretty cute so I started chatting with her we took the same bus and I was nervous but I asked for her number and we went out on a date. We went to the movies (which was kinda bad since we didn't talk much because of the movie but I did learn she was bi) we started kissing and she wanted me to be hansy and we'll leave it at that. Now I kinda wasn't experienced in dating since I was in a relationship for 3 years online with a bad breakup so this was like starting over in the dating zone and I thought she was moving pretty fast. At the movies I did told her since this was our first date I would pay for everything no strings attached and if she liked me on other dates we would split the bill. After the movie we talked for a long time around the mall just wondering around, she wanted to go somewhere private for intercourse but I live with my parents and didn't have $ for a hotel since I wasn't planning on going somewhere else. So we left it as that and the next day we did go. Keep in mind that I was paying for everything, not that I mind but we'll get that in the future.

So we dated about a month or more don't remember but we broke up since I got a new job and had a rotating schedule I felt kinda tired to go to her birthday (since I'm an introvert I just wasn't feeling being around lot of people partying) anyway that's why we broke up.

After the breakup we stayed as friend but after like 2 weeks after the breakup we started the Situation ship which basically means friends with benefits.

We agreed we would tell each other if we slept or liked someone else, but I noticed she wasn't telling me maybe as to not hurt my feeling but I did notice but since we had fun together intimitaly I decided not to ask.

I was fine not seeing someone else because I liked her and we slept together. She met some women then men, and when I felt like she did I met with other women but we always seemed to get back with each other.

How did I know? Well one time I wanted to surprise her with some cookies at her house since she was feeling sick but she wouldn't let me in since she said she wasn't home and left the TV on. Which was weird but I told her I would leave the cookies in a secret area and that was that. Then she wanted to wear a beautiful expensive dress like a princess outfit for Halloween. I agreed I would help her out but later she said she was going to dress up as Princess Bubble Gum and her ""friend"" as Marceline so after that I said I wouldn't give her more money for the dress because of a random excuse.  

Anyway I got sidetracked, since we were sleeping together I felt it was ok that when I asked her out I would pay for everything sort of like a sugar daddy situation. We mostly went to hotels but sometimes to movies and the usual places.

It's been 3 years and honestly that's not a sustainable relationship and I was considering breaking up as friends, to find a ""real"" girlfriend. So when I proposed the breakup, she started telling me that she loved me and wanted something more serious (which we had talks before) but I just could shake the feeling that if I committed to her (which I practically was it would be a mistake in the future), I wanted to be with her honestly but I told her that I felt the only reason she loved me is because I paid for everything and I'm good at bed (sounds like I'm bragging but she only had an Org with me so I think I'm good IDK)

She told me that how could I think that, she only has asked me for money recently because she knows she can rely on me (also she kinda got sick recently and has to pay for pills). So she cried but we made up and everything was back to normal.

Honestly I didn't know what to do my mom who is lesbian always told me she was using me for money and that I would give her a good life, and that she is not bi she is actually lesbian because she was once like that and she has a gaydar (which I also think that because she has done it like twice by watching videos while we do it)

Also in the same topic I met a Didi lesbian driver that said Bi-women usually go for the men for economic purposes that I shouldn't worry about her not choosing me, but that I shouldn't spend all my money on her. (Also I didn't tell her I spend money on her I think she deduced it I just wanted an opinion about biwomen) We talked about the subject because she bonded with me of her relationship so I thought I could discuss mine as well.

So I started overthinking, and slowly distancing myself but she felt heart broken and wanted to talk. We talked and I told her that what we had was real for me that I did love her. I asked her if she wanted to stay friends she said no and not to talk to her again until I know what I want.

We had 3 good years, we never really fought about anything, we have the same hobbies. She doesn't like to drink or smoke as well as I. I do miss her it's been less than a month since the break up and I'm not sure if I did the right thing. 

I forgot to mention she was actually the one who broke up with me (as friends with benefits for 3 years or whatever our weird relationship was) because I didn't show up for a date which was the last straw for her, the reasons were justified but I decided not to argue with her and face the breakup, she told me that all it took for me getting back with her was for me to commit. She felt that she wasted 3 years of her life with me which I do understand her point of view but I told her that I don't regret it because I loved the time I had with her.

So the question remains am I the A hole, was I being used, did I unintentionally use her?

I do understand if she felt being used, if all we did was go out and have intercourse, but that's what we were and what we had agreed back then. Yes we both fell in love with each other but I feel that I was giving more and risking more in the relationship than her (since she could break up with me if she was lesbian).

My ideal relationship is having a partner you can count on emotionally, money wise, intercoursely and being their for each other. And by money wise I mean not me always having to pay for everything, or at least respect my boundaries that I'm inviting her popcorn and soda for example and she wants me to pay her hot dogs and go out to eat after the movie. Which sucks because I really liked her. Am I also being an A hole because of money? If I had to choose between love and money I would choose love so why do I feel like this?

Should I try to amend things and try to get back with her? Is money really not that important? Was my gut wrong about her using me?

I mean worst case scenario if we get back together is that I become a slave to her economicly until I find out she cheats on me with other men or women, but part of me wants to believe we can be happy together just the 2 of us.

Note: Before she got sick and needed pills, she use to give most of her money to her mom because her brother had a debt issue. The rest of her money I don't what she does with it, sometimes I see her going out with friends to the mall or restaurants but I never question. She has gotten me gifts on special occasion but when we go out I pay for everything, there was only one time she did pay. I was ok with the everything with paying when we go out, but recently she had started asking for money for food or coffee and it slowly adds up.

Maybe I'm just overthinking and I should just move on and hope for the best. We did break up in a good note, well as good as a breakup might be but maybe not I'm not sure how she is taking it which I kinda want to ask her but I don't know honestly she had always sent mix messages sometimes I felt we were more than friends while sometimes not.

I will most likely be doing this process again just to make sure it wasn't a fluke lol:

* I ended up using 90 g of coffee and 720 ml of water. I know a lot of people told me to double the amount of coffee (150 g) but that seemed like so much coffee to me and I was scared to waste it ;-;
* I *did* follow the advice for steeping and I let that sit for 16 hours at room temperature. I tasted it at 12 and 16 hours to see if I could tell the difference. It just tasted stronger to me, but my partner said it tasted sour at 12 and was better at 16.
* I read that salt can help to disguise the bitterness, so I also added 1/8 tsp of salt to the cold brew before refrigerating it. It seemed like it tasted the same so not sure if that amount did anything.
* For the final drink, I did 120 ml of cold brew, 40 ml of oatmilk, and 20 ml of some brown sugar syrup I made (and some ice). I'm sure it doesn't need to be that precise, but I like having a ratio to follow for the final drink as well.

I kinda changed a lot of variables from my first batches so this isn't really a good experiment scientifically, but oh well lol. The final drink was actually pretty good: I could still taste the coffee, it wasn't watered down, and it had the right amount of sweetness for me.

If I did double the coffee to 150 g, how would that work: Would I use more milk for the final drink, or would I mix it with both water and milk? 150 seems like a lot to me, but if I can make more \[similar tasting\] drinks, it would be worth it. With my current ratio, I end up with \~600 ml of cold brew so that's enough for 5 drinks, 4 if I drink a little more.

I used up pretty much all the Bizzy coffee I had, so I will also be trying different beans for my next batch. I know fresh coarse grounds are recommended, but I *do* already have some espresso grounds. Would that be too fine for cold brew, or could I try using them & steep it for like half the time?

1nbb71w,https://www.reddit.com/r/NannyEmployers/comments/1nbb71w/what_does_your_nanny_do_with_your_infant_babies_4/,What does your nanny do with your infant babies (4+ months old)?,"
TLDR - our new nanny seems to be on her phone throughout the day while caring for our 4 month old.  I understand phone use while the baby is napping, but she‚Äôs also on it off and on while our daughter is awake and doing floor time. Is this typical? 

We have a 4 month old daughter and I‚Äôll be headed back to work next month. We had a nanny start recently to give some time for all of us to get used to each other before i head back. The nanny is younger than us and has no children of her own, but we liked her when we interviewed her and her reference we spoke to raved about her. Since she started, I‚Äôve noticed some things that have been feeling a little anxious and I don‚Äôt know if this behavior is normal or not. Would love the perspective of other families who have nannies for their infants. Some things I‚Äôve noticed:

1. She lives 10 minutes away but has been anywhere 2-5 minutes late every single day. I‚Äôve asked her to be on time and she is still at least 1 min late every day. I haven‚Äôt brought it up again because a few minutes isn‚Äôt a huge deal, but I‚Äôm concerned about when I start work. I‚Äôll be juggling a small baby, drop off in the morning for my 5 year old, and will have a small period of time to get ready for work so every minute will count. I wfh thankfully but that doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt need to be online at a certain time each day. We depend on my income. 

2. This is the biggest concern of mine - she‚Äôs on her phone throughout the day. I get that there‚Äôs not much you can do with a four month old, and that it can get kind of boring - but this is her job!! There are pockets of time where she‚Äôs holding my daughter and singing her songs, etc. but a lot of the time, when my daughter is doing floor time, she‚Äôs got her phone right next to her and will engage with my daughter for 15 seconds then get on her phone and text, and go back and forth like that. This is what I‚Äôve observed through our nanny cam. One day I stayed downstairs in our dining area and during that time she never used her phone and was engaged with our daughter the whole time. 

Our daughter literally naps for 3-4 of the 8 hours she‚Äôs there, so she has plenty of down time to use her phone then. She helps with some light household tasks (cleaning bottles using our brezza bottle washer, unloading the dishwasher, & folding laundry) but for the most part she‚Äôs plopped on our couch on her phone while my daughter is napping. She‚Äôs on her phone so much that one day her phone actually died and now she brings a charger and portable charger with her so she never has to be without her phone while she‚Äôs here. 

Is this normal‚Ä¶? I‚Äôm confused because her reference raved about her and she seems great with our daughter when she IS engaged. She‚Äôs also good at following instructions I give her about things she can do to help. But I‚Äôm so worried about when my daughter is older and she starts walking and going to the park, library etc - is our nanny going to be on her phone ignoring our babe and putting her in danger? I‚Äôve seen this soo often while at the park etc so I‚Äôm very worried. 

All of that is to say - is this how your nannies are with your infant babies? Am I overreacting? My husband thinks I am. We only had a nanny for our son when he turned 1.5, and this woman was a GEM of a human who literally went above and beyond to the point where we would force her to rest and relax while he was napping because she was always helping with SOMEthing without us even asking. 

Also of note - we pay her a generous rate, sick/holiday/vacation included, I‚Äôve made her lunch if I see she hasn‚Äôt brought food from home, she uses my husband‚Äôs coffee maker to make herself coffee every morning, I think we are kind employers.

We argued, and I said some things I didn‚Äôt mean; dear God, I want to take them back, but I can‚Äôt. I‚Äôm stuck, I‚Äôm imprisoned here with this, this, imposter. This sacrilegious thing that has taken the place of my wife. I was drunk and I told her I didn‚Äôt think she was attractive, and I‚Äôm sorry, okay?! I‚Äôm sorry for what I‚Äôve done. She knows I thought she was beautiful, I know she knows it, she has to know, right?

‚ÄúDonavinnnnn..you‚Äôre still not looking at meee,‚Äù

I was at my breaking point, and tears began to sting my eyes. Her cold, grey hand reached over and caressed the edge of my newspaper, leaving dark, wet streaks running down the length of it. She ran her hand across the top back and forth, and eventually the paper grew soggy and damp in my hands. The corners began to fold in, and my wife‚Äôs decaying face started forcing its way into view.

With one flick of her broken wrist, she pushed the paper, and the whole thing slumped over in my arms.

Maggots ate away at her face, and gaping black wounds etched the sides of her neck. Her eye sockets were completely black and hollow, but the worst part of all was her mouth. Her jaw was dislocated, yet her words came out so fluently, filling the room with the stench of rotting meat each time she spoke.

‚ÄúAren‚Äôt I pretty, Donavin? Don‚Äôt you love me?‚Äù

Her pouts grew into sobs, which eventually mutated into distorted wails. Ear-splitting screams that only I could hear.

She‚Äôs still wearing her beautiful wedding dress, the silky white now coated with mucus and mud.

I love my wife. I miss my wife. Lord, forgive me for what I‚Äôve done to my wife.",1,1757295806.0,shortstories,2,1.0,False

I drink coffee constantly and this is my downfall, I also have a deviated septum and I mouth breathe at night because of this. 

Anyways, the hygienist pointed out that where my wisdom tooth was extracted a year or two ago, the gum healed weird, it looks like it is kind of sagging. I‚Äôm going to go to the oral surgeon and see if he can fix this. I floss regularly but it‚Äôs just so far back in my mouth I didn‚Äôt notice the gum was weird or anything. I don‚Äôt even know if this is what the issue is or not.

I had a filling in between one of my canines and front teeth and one on a back tooth. So I had lidocaine injections in the front of my mouth and side. 

It‚Äôs been 3-4 days now and I have this pain in the back of my mouth that seems to be moving? This makes me think maybe the needle hit a nerve or my nerves are just all fucked up form having this work done. But it felt like the weird gum section was sore (this is back left side) then sometimes it feels like it‚Äôs in my jaw bone, left side and then sometimes it moves to my face, left side about under my eye area/cheek. 

What could this be, is it just irritated nerves that will settle down?

I've been asked by teachers in middle school if I had ADD or something but I just brushed it off but even in high school I had the same issues - horrible focus, trying to study was such a chore too.

I'm not like stupid but I feel like I nerf my true academic and general success with this like idek what to call it. I procrastinate everything for a better time or a better me and even when I open an email to reply to I'll just stare at it forever.

This has always been an issue but it's been easy to ""whatever"" through but I'm deep into college now and I really can't carry this habit through the rest of school or even my life. I have always thought it was some form of ADHD but I really don't want to use that as an excuse. Like what if it isn't and I'm actually just really lazy and this has always been a problem I could resolve but I'm the issue too ??? does that make sense.

Literally writing this right now I'm not doing something as simple as writing a discussion post for school. I've been trying to start it for hours and I thought even maybe I need a pick me up cause I'm tired so I got a coffee (I don't eve drink coffee).

Looking for the board games community in Fergus/Elora. I‚Äôd love to see if there are folks in Fergus who‚Äôd be into me running some pop-up board game nights.

Tables for D&D, card games, or Warhammer for the more hardcore players

A laid-back space to grab a coffee or snack and meet other gamers


I‚Äôd love your input:

Would you come out to something like this in Fergus or Elora?

What games would you want to see?

Any ideas for great local venues to host the first event?

1nbazhk,https://www.reddit.com/r/SandalsResorts/comments/1nbazhk/review_on_st_vincent/,Review on St Vincent,"We just got back from St Vincent for our honeymoon and it was also our first Sandals trip. Overall, I would say the trip was 7/10 for us. I wanted to provide an honest review for anybody that's looking to book for their honeymoon!

  
Pros: 

* The resort was brand new! Everything was immaculate. From the rooms to the amenities, it was spotless!
* The resort was surrounded by mountains, it was breathtaking, and we never got sick of it.
* The pools and beach were dead the entire time we were there. There were 0 issues finding chairs and we were able to go to multiple pools every day!
* They had free snorkeling trips throughout the week, it was a super cool experience to see the local fish!
* There were 2 coffee shops on the resort, one on either side. I got coffee almost everyday, the boozy coffee was my fave!

Cons:

* Island time. If you are type A like me and my husband, waiting will get a little old. It took over 45 minutes to receive our bags, and food also required a decent amount of waiting as well. I would also recommend avoiding the desserts.
* Constant phone calls. We would receive phone calls every day. They would call for turndown service and we received multiple calls about rewards and reviews. Wasn't super ideal for newlyweds that wanted to relax in the room.
* We could hear everything outside. We got woken up most mornings because we could hear the cleaning/maintenance staff outside.
* We went on an excursion and while the excursion itself was super fun, we were given 0 instructions on where to meet and the time listed was also wrong. It created a lot of stress that could have been avoided.
* The resort gift shop was pretty empty. I was hoping to bring back some souvenirs but there unfortunately wasn't very much.

Despite the cons, we had a vacation of a lifetime and were glad to visit St Vincent! ",1,1757295565.0,SandalsResorts,1,0.66,False
1nbaza2,https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/1nbaza2/what_does_your_nanny_do_with_your_infant_babies_4/,What does your nanny do with your infant babies (4+ months old)?,"TLDR - our new nanny seems to be on her phone throughout the day while caring for our 4 month old.  I understand phone use while the baby is napping, but she‚Äôs also on it off and on while our daughter is awake and doing floor time. Is this typical? 

We have a 4 month old daughter and I‚Äôll be headed back to work next month. We had a nanny start recently to give some time for all of us to get used to each other before i head back. The nanny is younger than us and has no children of her own, but we liked her when we interviewed her and her reference we spoke to raved about her. Since she started, I‚Äôve noticed some things that have been feeling a little anxious and I don‚Äôt know if this behavior is normal or not. Would love the perspective of other families who have nannies for their infants. Some things I‚Äôve noticed:

1. She lives 10 minutes away but has been anywhere 2-5 minutes late every single day. I‚Äôve asked her to be on time and she is still at least 1 min late every day. I haven‚Äôt brought it up again because a few minutes isn‚Äôt a huge deal, but I‚Äôm concerned about when I start work. I‚Äôll be juggling a small baby, drop off in the morning for my 5 year old, and will have a small period of time to get ready for work so every minute will count. I wfh thankfully but that doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt need to be online at a certain time each day. We depend on my income. 

2. This is the biggest concern of mine - she‚Äôs on her phone throughout the day. I get that there‚Äôs not much you can do with a four month old, and that it can get kind of boring - but this is her job!! There are pockets of time where she‚Äôs holding my daughter and singing her songs, etc. but a lot of the time, when my daughter is doing floor time, she‚Äôs got her phone right next to her and will engage with my daughter for 15 seconds then get on her phone and text, and go back and forth like that. This is what I‚Äôve observed through our nanny cam. One day I stayed downstairs in our dining area and during that time she never used her phone and was engaged with our daughter the whole time. 

Our daughter literally naps for 3-4 of the 8 hours she‚Äôs there, so she has plenty of down time to use her phone then. She helps with some light household tasks (cleaning bottles using our brezza bottle washer, unloading the dishwasher, & folding laundry) but for the most part she‚Äôs plopped on our couch on her phone while my daughter is napping. She‚Äôs on her phone so much that one day her phone actually died and now she brings a charger and portable charger with her so she never has to be without her phone while she‚Äôs here. 

Is this normal‚Ä¶? I‚Äôm confused because her reference raved about her and she seems great with our daughter when she IS engaged. She‚Äôs also good at following instructions I give her about things she can do to help. But I‚Äôm so worried about when my daughter is older and she starts walking and going to the park, library etc - is our nanny going to be on her phone ignoring our babe and putting her in danger? I‚Äôve seen this soo often while at the park etc so I‚Äôm very worried. 

All of that is to say - is this how your nannies are with your infant babies? Am I overreacting? My husband thinks I am. We only had a nanny for our son when he turned 1.5, and this woman was a GEM of a human who literally went above and beyond to the point where we would force her to rest and relax while he was napping because she was always helping with SOMEthing without us even asking. 

Also of note - we pay her a generous rate, sick/holiday/vacation included, I‚Äôve made her lunch if I see she hasn‚Äôt brought food from home, she uses my husband‚Äôs coffee maker to make herself coffee every morning, I think we are kind employers.

I‚Äôd love to start building a local gaming community through pop-up board game nights.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm imagining:

Casual meetups at a local caf√© or coworking space

A library of classics (Catan, Ticket to Ride, Codenames) + heavier stuff for the hobby gamers (Heroquest)

Dedicated tables for D&D, Warhammer, and card games (MTG, Pokemon)

Coffee, snacks, and a fun space to hang out (without staring at screens all night)


What I‚Äôd love to know from you:

Would you come out to something like this in Fergus/Elora?

What games would you want to see at the table?

Any suggestions for good venues to host the first pop-up?


I‚Äôm just one guy trying to bring gamers together and see if there‚Äôs enough local interest. If this sounds cool, drop a comment. Also, if you‚Äôre into it, I‚Äôll keep you posted as the first event takes shape.

umm about me, 38m eastern us. heavy into music, old punk rock and rock n roll, metal (mostly doom), some weird 90s alternative and anything weird and kinda similiar to that. films i mostly watch artsy nonsense and old ones but i can still get into a dumb comedy or cheesy action. i don't really watch that much television but i did start the king of the hill reboot and i'm digging it, other than that i used to like offbeat comedies (always sunny, eastbound and down) and crime dramas (sopranos, breaking bad). i do like to play games (i'm on ps5) but i dunno if i qualify as a legit gamer bc i pretty much just play dead by daylight. i'm up for playing new games with new people as long as you're cool with me being awful at it. beavis and butthead skins tempting me into fortnite.... ü§î pittsburgh penguins hockey, prepared for a long miserable season haha. making things, or trying to make things, loading up an AliExpress cart with tons of stuff for diy projects and never actually hitting checkout. playing guitar and buying too many effects, drinking way too much coffee.

things i'm not into: politics, religion, anime, comics, whatevers on netflix.. reddit is prolly the wrong platform for me haha. i get that things suck but i really don't wanna talk with someone who's always angry and unpleasant or just trauma dumps. not equipped to be a therapist.

i'm cool with chatting with anyone as long as you're over 30. i like my people a little bit weird and offbeat. any time zone is fine, any country, etc etc. no romanticals. if anything caught your eye and interests you feel free to send me a chat request. thanks!",1,1757295050.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

Having you in my life is sometimes painful, but so  wonderful. Almost 2 years of learning to navigate the most avoidant person I've come to know, you are a confusingly lovely man. You said you loved me the other night,  while having our heart to heart. It didn't have a bit of context, you're very good at keeping your words bidirectional, though you may not mean to. 

From your smell to the noises you make in your sleep... I miss them. I miss waking up for work by you hitting me with a pillow and a cup of coffee in hand before work. Even after we stopped dating I stayed the night with you almost every week, never continued the physical (until several months later), just cuddled like an old couple. Watching movies, getting food, just genuinely hanging out. 

It's been 2 months since I've stayed with you now, I miss you rolling over and wrapping around me, and we both just melt into it. We're still friends, and still work so closely. My lunch buddy. My confusion. My sunshine.

I don't want to let go, and right now I can't seem to figure out how even if I wanted to. We always find our way back to that place after an issue, back holding one another. 

You don't want a relationship right now, you're broken, and you're dating others... You tell me I'm the only woman in your bed, the only woman that comes to your apartment. I have shampoo... a razor in your shower. What is this dynamic, do you even know?

I love you... you listen when I'm overreacting, and always try. Anyone else would have left during my hard moments, but not you, even if it was something related to you, to us. You know the hurt I carry from you, and the love I carry for you. 

You're wonderful in so many ways, you're not like anyone in this world. The pain in my chest and stomach... visit too frequently. I'm drowning in heartache and bliss. 

What do I do from here... will I always be in your life like you say?... or will this come to an ending, breaking through that bliss I feel with you. Why is this so complicated? How did we get here? And where will we go?

I've tried to date, you always ask me about it. I tell you about them, but I have no interest. Ive been on 5 dates (online dating) and I can't let go of how much I want you, in every way. 

You'll never see this, but it's spoken into the universe now. Making my reality... reality. I love you dearly, my best friend, my ex, my colleague, my heartache, my love.",3,1757294847.0,UnsentLetters,2,1.0,False
1nbapso,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Used-Ad2513/comments/1nbapso/roleplay_gal/,Roleplay Gal,"Hello!  Im sussing out characters and world i want to trybut can be flexible to world building and the character of your choice.  As long as Im writing, im good.  And I love tinkering with breadth of characters, coming up with conflicts, pivots, etc.  I like the challenge of an audience to push me to improve the style Im working on.  

25+ preferred

The characters I have I will want to try and work through and play as authentically as possible (below writing sample offers a glimpse into a slice of life type character).  There is a vampire element I will want to introduce and I have worked through a lot of rules, lore, restrictions related to skills/powers. Tons of historic medieval history but not required of you.  Points if you understand medieval culture though.  HOWEVER, open to alternative faction monster styles, so to speak.  Point is there will triggering content but only to the extent of consent. Preferably, you will be open to fights, rolling outcomes to an extent to keep it unexpected and fair, as well as some level of deeper character exchange and power exchanges where it makes sense to explore dynamics and tighten or web conflict. Also, some -isms could be part of the culture but never part of OOC culture.

My primary characters are generally in their 30s.  Keep in mind that these are characters, not meee.  So prefer 3rd person and can intermix present and past tense to build backstories and lore, so to speak.  Really, just come with your dreams and desires :)  I can do slice of life all day just do have a couple vampires I need to work on.  Do you have a character you want to explore?  

*no godmodding or ridiculous take overs 
*consent is required for potentially triggering content
*If a scene just doesnt do it for ya, we can adjust!
*Character profile will be important 


I am focused on continuing to improve my writing and am hopeful this piques interest for those who are deepening their skills.  This is novella type generally.  Responses are not required to match length but offer interactions that test and play and build.  

 Ive been roleplaying 2 years so still learning!


*******Writing Sample

Paul's F350 rumbles into the lot around 6:30am, diesel engine vibrating deeply. Betsy and Scott stumble out of the front office, squinting against the early sun that's already promising to be a real challenge by noon. Paul's wife leans out the passenger window with a smile that could light up half of East Texas, her little mutt barking a hello that sounds more like a demand for attention.

""I brought breakfast! Y'all hungry?"" Dorene lifts up a couple of styrofoam containers, the terrier sniffing at the contents and panting like he wasn't already fed more than his share, his tail appearing and disappearing behind him like a metronome set to frantic. 

Paul's thick frame falls out of the driver's side, boots hitting the gravel with the solid thunk of a man who's been climbing out of trucks for forty-odd years. His gait carries the story of hard work - shoulders that have hauled more weight than they should, knees that protest the morning cold, but still moving with the confident rhythm of someone who knows his business. He lifts his weathered Stetson off his salt-and-pepper head in that old-style Texan gesture that's as automatic as breathing, running thick fingers through thinning hair before settling the hat back where it belongs. Then he leans his arms inside the back of the truck bed, arms and chest that have gone soft around the edges but still carries the frame of the linebacker he once was.  Paul gives a crooked grin, showing off a smile missing a crown and weathered by age and coffee.

Betsy offers a toothy smile to Dorene, with the glint of gold on her replaced incisor she had lost in a bar fight, reflecting morning light, relief washing over her face at the beckoning breakfast. But it's Scott who snatches those containers faster than a preacher grabs collection money, opening them like the treasures inside might evaporate if he doesn't claim them right now. He hands the one he hasn't already violated to Betsy with the grace of a man who knew machines better than women. He shakes it towards her impatiently, already turning back to his own feast.

""You hanging around today, huh?"" Betsy asks Dorene between bites of what tastes like salvation wrapped in eggs and bacon, accepting a thermos mug of black coffee that's strong enough to wake the dead, washing down the grease. She passes it to Scott, who drains it like he's been wandering the desert for forty days, trading his empty container back to Betsy, with an insistance that earns him a scowl which he returns with an air kiss, puckering at Betsy his thanks before he pivots to help Paul load the trailer with the day's swaps, handing the mug gently back to Dorene.

""I got nothing better to do today, and looks like it's good for you both that I did, 'cause you know Paul wasn't gonna think of breakfast."" Dorene rolls her eyes and frowns, but it's all theater ‚Äì the kind of loving exasperation that comes from twenty-plus years of marriage to a man who can rebuild an engine blindfolded but forgets to eat unless someone puts food directly in front of him.

1nbamks,https://www.gofundme.com/f/the-girlies-vs-janet,Janet Update by the Girlied and their Gofundme,">UPDATE AS OF SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 7th 2025:Well hello again, friends!For those who are new here, or may have understandably forgotten, in December 2023, a federal lawsuit was filed against me (Bekah), Kitti (@caffinatedkitti), and the hosts of the Do We Know Them? podcast, Jessi and Lily.The plaintiffs are a content creator known as ‚ÄúLauren the Mortician‚Äù and her attorney, Jeanette Braun. They filed their complaint after each of us had separately made videos calling out what we, along with many others, saw as concerning behavior, ranging from:

>unethical practices

>harmful actions

>homophobic remarks

>repeated misuse of the DMCA copyright takedown system across multiple social media platforms

>Not every issue applies equally to both of them, but together their actions raised serious concerns that we, and many other people online, felt were important to discuss.We shared our opinions, we shared factual statements, we showed receipts, just like we do with any other topic that we cover on our own respective platforms.Our respective coverage regarding their behavior led to the following:

>Kitti had the police sent to her home for unfounded wellness checks called in by both Lauren the Mortician and Jeanette Braun. (These calls were made separately within hours of each other and can be proven by recordings of those phone calls obtained by Kitti. Neither call provided substantial reasoning that justified the need for wellness checks.)

>Kitti received a cease and desist letter full of wild demands and legal threats that CC‚Äôd Kitti‚Äôs mother and a theater company that was unaffiliated with Kitti.

>A rumor was started that Kitti consumes human organs and is demonic was started and spread by Lauren and another very large creator and known client of Jeanette Braun.

>I (Bekah) nearly lost my account due to misuse of DCMA platform by the Plaintiffs.

>Lily and Jessi nearly lost the Do We know Them Channel due to misuse of the DCMA platformby Jeannette Braun, who filed multiple DMCA Takedown Requests against videos on their channel resulting in strikes against two of their videos that included clips of her content.

>Jeanette Braun would go on to file a legal complaint via the Copyright Claims Board against Jessi and Lily for one of the two videos that she had filed a DMCA Takedown against, only for the CCB to rule over a full year later that their use of her content had been a ‚Äútextbook example of fair use‚Äù and dismiss the case with prejudice. Braun then made the bold attempt to challenge the board‚Äôs final determination, only to be met by a lengthy response in which the board not only reinforced their initial decision, but also questioned her understanding of fair use and went as far as to describe her arguments as ‚Äúmeritless‚Äù, ‚Äúpreposterous‚Äù, ‚Äústrange‚Äù, explaining that such arguments only served to undermine her credibility.

>A creator by the name of Jamie Grayson, a CPST (Child Passenger Safety Technician) had his account permanently removed due to misuse of the copyright claims and reporting system. This occurred after Lauren the Mortician made comments across her social media platforms as well as on a podcast hosted by one of Jeanette Braun‚Äôs other clients, questioning his qualifications and intentions based on the fact that he‚Äôs an openly gay man without children, who works in the child safety field. This comments were made despite Lauren being aware that he is a licensed in two countries, and a well-respected figure in the field of carseat safety, with decades of experience under his belt.

>After their attempts to silence us by attempting to completely remove our platforms from the internet, simply due to our limited coverage regarding their behavior, had failed......Jeanette Braun and Lauren filed this lawsuit against the four of us in what we believe to be yet another attempt to censor us by trying to financially drain us in an effort to have us retract our statements.At this point, we have been engaged in litigation since December of 2023.It has been over a year and a half and they have just filed a third amended complaint, forcing us to basically start from square one to defend ourselves against what we continue to believe is a frivolous lawsuit.In our last update, we were thrilled to share that in response to their second amended complaint, the court had ruled on our motions and dismissed almost everything in the complaint, some with prejudice, some without.Unfortunately, the only remaining piece that wasn‚Äôt outright dismissed was a tweet that Lily had posted.*(Just for old time‚Äôs sake, here is a brief summary of the context surrounding that surviving complaint.*¬†[*This is the tweet*](https://x.com/lily_marston/status/1733981442819182802)¬†*Lily posted after receiving the copyright strikes on the two videos on Do We Know Them? As a result of the two takedown requests submitted on behalf of Jeanette Braun/Braun IP Law.*Her tweet came after her and Jessi discovered that when they viewed the copyright information associated with both of the episodes that had been removed from their channel, it revealed that¬†[the name listed as the content owner](https://x.com/lily_marston/status/1733640729782825249)¬†was actually one of Braun‚Äôs clients, despite neither video containing any content that belonged to the client.Furthermore, one of the two alleged copyright infringements has since been¬†[legally dismissed](https://dockets.ccb.gov/document/download/11921)¬†with prejudice by the Copyright Claims Board who determined it to be a ‚Äúclear case of fair use.‚ÄùUnsatisfied with their ruling, Braun would proceed to challenge this decision and file a request for reconsideration. Luckily, the CCB quickly denied her in a¬†[7 page response](https://dockets.ccb.gov/document/download/12293)¬†that noted how they could just deny her request, but that they would take the opportunity to explain ‚Äúwhy the Episode so obviously qualifies for fair use for educational purposes‚Äù.In fact, they reiterate that sentiment a second time, explaining how they will ‚Äúbriefly explain the fair use factors again with the hope that Braun IP might change its tactics in the future.‚ÄùAs a lawyer whose firm promotes itself as having an expertise and experience in Intellectual Property Law, Jeanette Braun should be well versed in the concept of fair use and understand how it protects certain content from copyright infringement. And when submitting a takedown request via YouTube, it is stated at the very top of the form that the individual filling out the form must ‚ÄúRemember that not all copyrighted content is eligible for removal. Some videos are protected by fair use and similar laws.‚ÄùFurthermore, before submitting any DMCA Takedown Request, Braun was required to sign under penalty of perjury after agreeing to the following:

>*I state UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY that:*

>*I am the owner, or an agent authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.*

>*I have a good faith belief that the use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and*

>*This notification is accurate.*

>*Unfortunately, during this stage of the lawsuit, we have been limited in what information we‚Äôre allowed to address or disclose in our responses to any of the complaints filed on behalf of Lauren and Jeanette, leaving us unable to provide the court with information that we feel would prove that we hadn't done anything illegal, damaging, hateful, or harmful.This leaves us at the mercy of what is presented in the complaints, and leaves the judge completely unaware of crucial aspects that would show what led us to this point.Instead, it has allowed the plaintiffs to paint a different narrative in which they present themselves as victims instead of showing that our actions were rooted in our attempt to shed light on the fact that the plaintiffs have weaponized the copyright system, law enforcement, and now the legal system, all because we were a few of the many people who covered this topic when it was trending (two years ago).Because of the fact, the claims surrounding Lily‚Äôs tweet survived our argument for a full dismissal.)*But because it was the ONLY surviving item, the judge ordered us to begin to wrap things up in a settlement conference which we agreed to and was officially scheduled by the court.While we are unable to discuss specifics of the settlement proposals, we were ready to approach the conference in good faith ‚Äî despite being shocked by some of what Lauren and Jeanette demanded of us, including items that disregarded previous judgements made by the court in our favor.Unfortunately, only days prior to the scheduled court ordered and dually agreed upon conference, Lauren and Jeanette pulled out and decided to refile their original complaint for the 3rd time, which would include the claims regarding Lily‚Äôs tweet as well as any claims made against me (Bekah) and Kitti that had been dismissed without prejudice (meaning the claim was dismissed but in a way that gives them the ability to rework the claim and submit them again). Any claims submitted regarding Jessi were dismissed with prejudice, meaning Jeanette and Lauren can't continue to peruse her legally further in this matter. (Which we obviously love for our girl, lol!)At this point, we are left feeling exasperated as this third attempt feels like just another way for them to prolong this process in hopes we run out of resources and give up. We are still fighting back, and finally were able to file a Rule 11 in our most recent filing to dismiss, moving to sanction them for frivolous litigation.We have also been tasked with beginning the process of discovery.While discovery will allow the door to opened for us to finally provide evidence, receipts, and context that we wish we could have presented to the courts a long time ago, we had hoped things wouldn‚Äôt reach this point, as it only adds to the enormous legal fees that have been accrued in this case.In hopes of being able to continue this fight, we are opening our Girlies vs Janet legal fundraiser again, for the last time.We hate that we are forced to ask for your help to continue fighting, especially after so many of you have already been beyond generous with not only your donations but unwavering support as we navigate this mess.While any donations are greatly appreciated, please remember, there‚Äôs never any pressure to donate‚Äî you guys just interacting with our content and showing your support is beyond helpful.Please never feel obligated to donate if you are not able, especially considering the unprecedented times we are all currently existing in now.Thanks to each of you, their attempt to drain us financially with this lawsuit has failed, and we‚Äôve been able to afford an amazing legal defense to keep fighting.None of us have the words to express the immense impact this has made, or how insane it is to us to see such a show of care and support.When we already are all working hard everyday to support ourselves, our families, our kids, our pets, and fighting this lawsuit -- without your guys‚Äô support would, we never would have made it this far. In our opinionWe cannot thank you enough for allowing us to fight this without having to fear so deeply about our financial security due to the threat of these looming, seemingly never-ending legal fees. The fact that legal tactics like this bankrupt people everyday... we feel humbled to have avoided that so far thanks to each of you.Believe us when we say we want nothing more for this to finally come to an end. Especially when there are so many more important things happening in the world, it feels shameful that so much money has already had to go towards a case that we feel is a blatant misuse of the legal system, and we are mortified that we are put in a position to ask for more.So please, and again I cannot stress this enough, do not feel pressured to donate. If you have the choice between donating and getting a coffee in the morning, get the coffee. Seriously.Hopefully, our next update is filled with celebration and resolution.Either way, we‚Äôre thankful to have your ears and your eyes on us whenever we come to y‚Äôall with an update. You‚Äôre not letting us go at this alone, and that by itself means the world to our little quartet.We love you all so much,The Girlies aka Lily, Bekah, Kitti and Jessi (cheerleading her girlies all the way to the finish line!)*P.s.

1nbakzb,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1nbakzb/the_eyes_on_my_walls_started_talking_to_me/,The eyes on my walls started talking to me.,"There was an eye in my wall. From a tiny hole in the brick of my fireplace, the eye stared at me. I could feel it before I could see it, that gut feeling you get when something hidden is watching you from afar. Then I saw it, the green irised eye that was just barely visible through the gap in the bricks, as if a face were impossibly trapped in the fireplace. The eye blinked at me, then looked away as if embarrassed. It didn‚Äôt seem natural, so I got a bit of caulk and sealed the hole. That‚Äôs better. I rest myself on the couch once again, assimilating into the stillness of this old house. It‚Äôs lonely here. But no‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not so alone am I? Of course, my wife is here, upstairs knitting a sweater I believe. She always makes the most adorable tiny clothes, so that should we have a child someday we‚Äôll already have them made. What days those were, I did love my wife. Yes, it isn‚Äôt so lonely here.¬†

I used to work as a roofer. Shingling roofs is hard work, a bit of a lost art nowadays. In my time, we didn‚Äôt have machines for those sorts of things. I worked through rain and shine, summer and winter, with nothing but a hammer, nails and a strong will. It‚Äôs hot out today. My hands are slicked with sweat, making it difficult for me to keep a grip on my hammer. I put the nail in place and strike it down with force. BAM. I sort through the box and find another. I put the nail in place and strike it down with force. BAM. It has only gone in half way this time, so I strike it again. BAM. Much better. I sort through the box and find a new nail, this one a little rusted. I put the nail in place and strike it down with force. BAM. I sort through the box and find another. I put the nail in place and‚Ä¶ my hand trembles. I try to steady myself but my hand refuses. My arm bumps like a heart beat and a piercing pain pulses through my veins as I stare down at the nail. My breathing wavers for a moment. I hold my breath and reel my hand back, striking the nail down in fury. BAM. A circular dent is left in the shingle. I allow myself to breathe again. Much better. I look upon the completed roof, not a single imperfection in sight. This was work to be proud of.¬†

After I packed up for the day, I went to pick up my son from school. The school was far from our town, so it would be a long ride to get there. He would have been better off closer to home. I tried to tell Silvia as much, but she insisted that private school would be ‚Äúenriching‚Äù for him. It wasn‚Äôt. He didn‚Äôt belong in that environment, with those teachers, around those stuck up rich kids. There was too much pressure on him there, it just made him afraid to go to school. Because of that, we ended up with an idiot son. She didn‚Äôt like it when I said that, but it was true. We did have an idiot son and it was because of that damned private school. Speaking of which, where is that school now? I‚Äôve been driving for hours and I feel like I haven‚Äôt gotten anywhere. Now that I think about it, I‚Äôve never seen this road before. How could I have ended up here? The land that surrounds me is flat and desolate, the blackened soil scorched of life. I slow the truck to a stop, attempting to reorient myself. The sun is already beginning to set. I pull out my phone, hoping I can message Silvia to tell her I‚Äôll be home late. To my dismay, the phone is dead. Maybe there‚Äôs a charger somewhere around here, maybe stuffed somewhere in the glove compartment. I open it to check. There is an eye there. I close the glove compartment swiftly. I step out onto the dirt, my boots sinking slightly in the dried dusty earth as I begin to look around. There are no other cars on the road, no birds in the sky, no bugs wriggling under my feet, not a single indication of life. But faintly, faintly, I see something far away. There is a light off in the distance, far off of the road. Everything that surrounds it looks warped, the distant clouds and flat land becoming stretched and deformed. Without thinking, I begin to walk towards it.¬†

The setting sun is still hot as ever and my throat is becoming dry. I turn to get some water from my truck but it isn‚Äôt there anymore, I‚Äôve already walked many miles away from it. I look up to see the moon shining down on me, stars now dotting the sky far above. I stare up bewildered while my legs propel me forward, dragging the rest of my body mindlessly. The dirt grips my boots with every step but I march forward still. I look to the horizon and see the light once more, brighter, clearer now. The air becomes thinner the further I go, reeking of burnt woodchips. As it gets closer, the stars that once dotted the sky begin to fade away. One by one they disappear until the sky becomes empty. Above me is a pitch black void, but the pillar of light in the distance has become ever brighter. One step after another and I inch forward, closer, closer, closer, closer. The soil beneath me turns into sand as I continue. The dunes roll across the landscape but they cannot hinder my progress. The sand is blown about by gusts of wind that burn my eyes which cannot close, lest I let the light out of my view. Step by step by step, the light becomes closer and closer and closer. Yes‚Ä¶ I can feel it now‚Ä¶ The golden pillar's warmth is just within reach. But no‚Ä¶ no, I wasn‚Äôt there. Of course, I was at home with my wife. She was asleep on the couch, an unfinished sweater lying in a ball on her chest. There is an eye poking out from between the cushions.¬†

The dreams started that night. While my body lay peaceful and still in my bed, my mind was somewhere far away from there. The dreams were vivid, more real than any dream I‚Äôd ever had before. Everything around me was incomprehensible, a swirling vortex of sounds and colors that mixed into a cacophony of noise, but it all felt more real than reality itself. I was falling, falling, falling, falling, falling, falling‚Ä¶

When I landed I was back in my bed, rays of morning sunlight shining into my eyes.¬†

I descended the stairs into the living room, trying to shake the strange dream from my head. I found Silvia there, sitting on the couch and rubbing her temples. She turned towards me as I approached, pulling at her messy black hair. I suddenly felt sick when I saw her face. Something about her felt different, something in her‚Ä¶ No, no that's not right. She shines me a bright smile, wisping her perfectly groomed hair away from her eyes. I sit beside her, kissing her on the cheek.¬†

‚ÄúLong night?‚Äù I say, motioning to the tiny sweater. She giggles.

‚ÄúI guess so,‚Äù She concedes, sighing. ‚ÄúI thought I could make some progress on this one after work, but I fell asleep.‚Äù I nod. The sweater has become bunched up, a messy ball of yarn. Me and Silvia have always wanted kids, we‚Äôve been trying for some time now. I‚Äôve always thought that maybe she was too stressed for it, so I tell her to take more time for herself and let me do more of the work for her. But ever since I got back home, she‚Äôs been a lot different. She tells me about dreams she began to have, dreams where she would meet a sudden and gruesome demise. She says that in them, it feels like her head is caving in on itself. She‚Äôs paranoid that something bad could happen to her if she isn‚Äôt careful, or maybe that something has already happened? I dare not tell her why she feels this way.¬†

The work day was long, the laborious shingling robbing me of my energy. Silvia was there to greet me when I walked into the living room. She stood with her arms crossed, her hair messily drooping behind her ears. The scowl on her face spoke volumes before she ever began to talk.

‚ÄúWhere have you been?‚Äù she said, her voice hoarse.¬†

‚ÄúWorking,‚Äù I responded tiredly as I collapsed onto the couch. ‚ÄúWorking like I do everyday. The client's house was a little further away today if that‚Äôs what you mean.‚Äù She scoffed and rolled her eyes.¬†

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe you,‚Äù she spit. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been gone all this time and didn‚Äôt even‚Ä¶‚Äù She continued berating me, her face burning red as she yelled and swung her arms wildly. I sat and observed, hardly retaining any of what she had said. I‚Äôve never been confrontational when she does this, I find that it only serves to make things worse. Instead I sat, waiting for her to finish her rant. She grumbled out of the room, mumbling curses to herself as I slumped further into the couch. I was too tired to be frustrated. For a moment, my skin felt moist and sticky, but the feeling subsided quickly.¬†

I didn‚Äôt see Silvia before I left for work the next morning. The coffee hadn‚Äôt been made and I didn‚Äôt have any time to brew a pot. The drive to the house felt longer than it should have, the roads twisted and turned in odd directions and the architecture of the neighborhood's houses began to shift. Their roofs curled into spikes, the trees were melting and the asphalt was boiling. The neighborhood began to fade around me, crumbled to dust and blew away in the harsh winds. The air became thin as the landscape morphed into something different, something bright. I knew this place. I know it well. I was falling, falling, falling‚Ä¶¬†

No I wasn‚Äôt.

I was on top of the house, holding a new shingle in place. Then the voice said it again.

‚ÄúNo I wasn‚Äôt. I was on top of the house, holding a new shingle in place,‚Äù It said. It was my voice. My hands were slicked with sweat, making it difficult for me to keep a grip on my hammer. I put the nail in place and struck it down with force. BAM.

‚ÄúNo, that's not right,‚Äù the voice chimed in. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt I do this already?‚Äù Of course I did, I‚Äôve been shingling roofs for years. I reached into the box to grab a new nail, digging around to find one that hadn‚Äôt been bent yet. Something cold and wet touches my hand. It‚Äôs viscous and pulsing, I can feel it crawling up my fingers and oozing into my skin. I pull the nail out of it, the contents of the box sloshing around as I do. I raise my hand up and find that it‚Äôs become stained red, the liquid dripping from under my finger nails. My eyes dart to the box. There are only a few nails left. I knew I should have gone to the store before I came here. I put the nail in place, making sure to keep it as straight as I can. I look down to find that the shingle has fallen away and a hole has appeared where it used to be. There is an eye in the hole. I readjust the nail, sticking it into the wide open eye. I push and prod until it sticks to my liking. The nail shifts back and forth with the emerald eye as it looks around aimlessly. I hold it in place, reeling my hammer back and smacking it down. BAM.

The sky is dark when I return home. I lost track of time, it really has been a long day. Was it a long day? This is my home isn‚Äôt it? Of course it is, but it looks different somehow. The paint has chipped a bit more and the bushes have become overgrown. Has it really only been a day? No, that‚Äôs just what the voice says. It says a lot of things, but I know that it's lying to me. I had actually been gone for days, weeks maybe? A month? I stepped out of the truck and approached the home. I‚Äôve just been stressed out recently, that's all. It wouldn‚Äôt be so bad if Silvia made coffee in the mornings like she used to. How long has it been since I‚Äôve even seen her? I had been walking towards the house for a minute but didn‚Äôt move any closer, the uneven brick path stretching further forward with every step I took. Maybe if we hadn‚Äôt spent so much money on some private school we could have saved to buy a nicer house. Maybe we wouldn‚Äôt still be in this hole if we would have done what I said. The outer edges of the front door glowed with the crimson hue of a hellfire that burned inside. The smell of smoldering wood was overwhelming. I‚Äôm doing all I can and all I ever hear is complaining from you, you and Thomas both.¬†

‚ÄúBullshit, Roger,‚Äù She retorted sternly, stomping her heel into the hardwood floor. ‚ÄúYou do this all the time now, leaving for days at a time and coming back like nothing happened. What have you been doing all this time? Where have you been?‚Äù Her hair was frizzy and tangled, skin wrinkled and sagging. More wrinkles and more sagging, the features melted together as she continued yelling. Her voice became distorted, monstrous, like a broken radio playing static. I could hardly understand what she was saying anymore, the awful noise making my ears ring. Her face bubbled and a giant eye emerged from its center, the skin revolving around it like fish in a pond. All at once her voice became intelligible again and she screamed one word clearly.

‚ÄúROGER‚Äù She shrieked. She screamed again and again and again. ROGER. ROGER. ROGER. ROGER. I could hear her voice all around me, the very walls had begun to speak. They whispered to me tenderly, all in sync with each other. ROGER. ROGER. ROGER. The walls bent and groaned as they too began to bubble and burn, becoming scorched black like burnt coals. Eyes popped out of the walls like acne, dotting the room like stars in a dark sky. They fell from the ceiling, emerged from the floor, wriggled out from under my boots. Every one of them screamed my name. ROGER. ROGER. ROGER. Silvia‚Äôs arms and legs were invaded by a plague of eyes, swiftly spreading across her body and consuming her. Every eye was looking at me. They spoke in unison. ROGER. ROGER. ROGER. ROGER. ROGER. They are so loud. I can‚Äôt make them stop. Please, please make it stop. I cried in anguish as the screaming hammered at my eardrums. I held my ears but it didn't help, their voices were inside of my head. ROGER. ROGER. ROGER. ROGER. I reached for my tool belt. I grabbed my hammer.

I used to shingle roofs in the mornings. Shingling roofs is hard work, a bit of a lost art nowadays. In my time, we didn‚Äôt have machines for those sorts of things. I grabbed the nail firmly and struck it with all the force I could muster. BAM. I hit it again. And again. And again. BAM. BAM. BAM. BAM. BAM. I pushed her over and threw away her hand as she tried to defend herself. BAM. BAM. BAM. She grabbed my arm, nearly tearing the hammer away from me. This nail was stubborn. I brought the hammer down once more and her grip loosened. I hit the nail in. I hit it again. I hit it again. BAM. BAM. BAM. BAM. BAM. The nail squished and cracked as I continued. I hit it again. I hit it again. I hit it again‚Ä¶ My hammer became stuck, lodged deep into the broken shingle. I took deep shaky breaths as I tried to calm myself, my heart pounding in my ears. Silvia was there, laying motionless on the floor. No, that's not right, is it? Is it?¬†

My hands, my clothes, the hammer, the couch and the walls were all covered in blood. It soaked into the pillows, dripping down the white and yellow wallpaper. I could taste the iron in the air. The hammer was stuck upright in the cavern I had made in her skull. She was unrecognizable. I looked down at my trembling hands which were caked in red chunks. This was real. My stomach stirred and I resisted the urge to vomit. There were no eyes left, none on the walls, none on the ceiling or the floors, none on Silvia. But somehow, I still felt like I was being watched. Thomas stood over us, staring down at the scene completely frozen in awe. Tears fell silently from his eyes. Her eyes. His quivering mouth showed fear and the eyes showed disdain. I hated looking at those eyes.¬†

Me and Silvia had always wanted kids, we‚Äôd been trying for some time. This drive reminds me of when I used to take Thomas to school, as much as I hated it at the time. But I‚Äôm not driving to the school today, I‚Äôm driving away. Away from the family, away from the stress, and to somewhere I can‚Äôt quite put my finger on. It‚Äôs so dark out. I can barely see where I‚Äôm going as a sand storm blows over my car and scratches my windows. I step hard on the gas and speed across the bumpy terrain, the truck jolting up and down as I drive over potholes and stones. I don‚Äôt know which direction I‚Äôm headed but somehow I know I‚Äôm going the right way. I can feel it. When the engine eventually sputters and the truck slows to a halt I throw the door open and fall out onto the sand, hardly able to stand as the winds push me down to my knees. With every ounce of energy I have I push forward, slowly marching through the storm. The truck disappears behind a thick wall of yellow fog. The rushing sand cuts deep wounds into my skin and I can hardly keep it out of my eyes. Up and over the dunes I trek, shambling through the thick fog of sand. In the distance I can see it, the golden pillar growing ever closer. Just a little further.

I walk and walk and walk until my legs give out and I stumble to the ground in complete agony. I crawl forward through the pain, through the sand. Every inch forward drives a spike of pain through my entire body and I heave trying to find oxygen in the sand. The golden pillar is callously affixed in the distance. When I am incapable of moving my legs, I drag myself forward, my exposed hands covered in blood and rock. I pull forward an inch. I wheeze. I pull forward again, a little less this time. Just a little further, just a little further‚Ä¶ Then I collapse.¬†

I lay, the sound of rushing wind filling my ears. I begin to lose track of time, face down in the ever growing mounds of sand. I lay and the winds blow over me. I lay. Slowly, the rushing winds of the storm begin to silence. Soon, I can feel the rough sands disappearing from under me, the pain in my eyes dissipating. After a long time I regain strength in my limbs and bring myself to my knees. I can feel my skin sizzling as a blinding light pierces through my eyelids. When they open, the pillar's light consumes my vision. It‚Äôs radiant, emanating with some divine energy. The pillar dwarfs me completely, reaching up further in the sky than I could ever dream of seeing. It‚Äôs so impossibly gargantuan that it nearly surrounds me. I surrender myself to it and sob. I wallow at its base, marveling at its grandiosity, its absoluteness. I curl forward, throwing my blood covered hands forward in submission. For the first time in my life I feel centered, anchored to reality for a brief moment in the presence of this higher being.¬†

From the radiance something emerges, the shape of something that I don‚Äôt recognize at first. As it approaches I identify it as the shape of a man, but only the shape of one. He is pure light, a man made of star dust. He emerges from the pillar's core, stepping on air as if walking down steps. He floats in front of me, his face completely indiscernible in the luminescence. Something begins to emit from the man. He speaks to me without speaking, but I understand the words perfectly.¬†

‚ÄúRoger,‚Äù I feel him say calmly, the exact cadence of his voice unclear to me. ‚ÄúWhat has brought you to me?‚Äù His voice is booming, echoing across the terrain. I sit up, stifling my tears and gasping for air. I speak the best that I can.

‚ÄúI have done bad things,‚Äù I choke out, bowing my head. ‚ÄúI want to be free of this place. Please, let me be free of this nightmare!‚Äù Mucus burns my throat. The man stares down at me unwavering as I plead. His gaze burns into my soul. He‚Äôs deliberating, or maybe he takes amusement in my suffering. After a long time he finally speaks again.¬†

‚ÄúYou have done bad things,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI cannot erase your mistakes, nor can I erase the memory of those mistakes from your mind. However, I may be able to give you a second chance,‚Äù My sobbing calms and I look back up to the man with intrigue. The man continues, ‚ÄúI have also been trapped in this place as you are now. What I had looked for here was found, but I became stuck. But you can get me out, and I can bring you to someplace better. You can escape the actions you‚Äôve committed here and go back to normalcy, be with your wife again,‚Äù I sit before the man dumbfounded, considering what he said. Is that possible? Can I really see her again? I have to try.

‚ÄúWhat do I have to do?‚Äù I ask. The man drifts towards me, reaching his bright hand forward.¬†

‚ÄúYou just need to focus,‚Äù He answers. ‚ÄúYou will know when you arrive there, you will feel it. I cannot take you all the way there myself, but I will guide you.‚Äù He reaches out further, extending his light tipped fingers. I shiver, uncertain of what to do next. I‚Äôm unsure about the man, but I know what he speaks of. I can feel it, tugging me down, leading me home. I take a deep, trembling breath and nod.¬†

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I respond simply. I reach out to him slowly. My hand almost moves by itself, magnetized to the thing that hovers in front of me.¬†

Our hands connect.

The man's entire body suddenly explodes in light, my vision completely enveloped by the white glow. I suddenly feel myself falling, falling, falling, faster and faster. I fall through hundreds, thousands of layers in seconds. Indescribable shapes and colors flash before my fragile eyes. I fall, I fall. I see the beginnings of lives, the deaths of galaxies, the universe itself reaching out and invading my mind in complete sensory overload. The further I fall, the harder I feel its pull. I fall and fall and fall and I can feel that I am coming closer, closer, closer, closer, closer‚Ä¶

Then everything stops. When I wake up, I‚Äôm in bed.¬†

I am home.

Silvia lays down beside me, the stress of her workday apparent as she collapses and falls asleep almost instantly. I smile as I watch her lay, her chest rising and falling as she rests peacefully. She‚Äôs different now. Her hair is cleaner, her face is brighter and her eyes are blue. She‚Äôs happier now, like she was when we first met. After all of the ups and downs, it seems like we made it somehow. I begin to feel the weight of the day on my tired muscles as I begin to drift off. I roll over and hold her as I begin to sleep. Just outside of my blurred vision, in the corner of my room, I can still see her eyes watching me from afar.",1,1757294389.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

The thing is, these aren‚Äôt new to me. Central Park is free and I‚Äôve been there a million times. There‚Äôs a Sweetgreen a mile from where I live (and I‚Äôve been to the one in Bryant Park plenty). Flushing pho is $15 and an easy trip. I've been to Luckin Coffee in China too.

It just feels like he‚Äôs presenting really basic, easily accessible spots as if they‚Äôre some exclusive treat or unique experience I‚Äôve never had. I feel like I have to play dumb and be impressed that he's having these new experiences that he wants to share with me, when I've already experienced 99% of them before.

His ex wife (30F) cheated on him and caused the relationship to fall apart. Things were weird when he and I started dating because even though he and his ex were separated, they weren't divorced yet and hadn't 100% decided on divorce. I know we probably should have waited for him to be over her before we started dating, but we didn't mean to get so serious so fast (and yet he told me he loved me only a month in). 

Obviously they're divorced now, but I still find myself being pissed off at her. I'm mad that she hurt him, and I'm mad that he took so long to choose me (they decided to get divorced in December last year). Which again, I KNOW I was stupid to get into a relationship with a man who wasn't sure he was going to divorce yet, but there's no changing the past. The problem is I think about her too much. I even stalk her social medias on occasion, secretly hoping that her life is going shit.

He is nothing but good to me. He gets me flowers for no reason, every day we don't spend together, we spend hours on the phone, he drove me back and forth to a gig almost an hour away two weekends in a row (four times total) because I have trouble night driving, he's always there when I need him, he makes me laugh, he comforts me when I'm sad, he lets me drag him out to fairs and craft shows and concerts and whatever I want even though he's a homebody, when I wasn't doing well financially he paid for 100% of our dates and never complained (he even offered to pay my rent one month), he goes grocery shopping with me even though we don't live together, he never lets me carry something if he has a free hand, he gets me surprise coffees and other treats, he is sosososo wonderful and I want to spend my life with him, but I NEED to stop letting his ex take up so much of my mental energy. 

How do I get over HIS ex???

TLDR: I spend time ruminating and being pissed about my boyfriend's ex even though we've been dating almost a year, how can I get over her?",2,1757294024.0,relationships,11,0.75,False

1nbaefo,https://i.redd.it/v6wlptuscunf1.jpeg,What would you do with this rafter space?,"Hi everyone,

I'm looking for some ideas of what to do with this rafter space.  

This is my future (and current, sort of) Battle Station.  Im doing 30"" butcher block attached to the wall I'm an L shape in the right-hand corner of this photo.  Against the drywall is where my 3D Printers will go and to the right of that will be a general workbench and my desk.  This room is acoustically treated and the blue walls are fire rated fabric.  This is the bonus room over my garage and it measures 23x11 feet. 

I currently have two main ideas:  

1. Cover it in the same fabric as the walls.  
2. Paint everything above drywall white. 

I already have the fabric.  I've thought about installing some LEDs behind it that could serve as some mood lighting, even.  Specifically RGBW LEDs on an ESP32 most likely.  I will probably do this either way, now that I think about it.  

I think painting everything will make the room keep the more open feeling it has now.  But it may not look good with so much electrical cabling up there.  

Does anyone have any thoughts on these two ideas?  I've also thought about buying coffee bean bags and covering the ceiling with those.  That could be neat.

Any other ideas?

Thanks!

1nbadxg,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_PancakeHouseWorker/comments/1nbadxg/day_1/,Day 1,"Driving down the mostly deserted street, I finished my cheap motel coffee, tasting the even cheaper whiskey, burning my throat and igniting a fire in my stomach.  I crested a rise in the road and saw two of the most iconic signs known to people throughout the southeastern portion of the United States.  Two signs with black letters on yellow backgrounds filled the horizon ‚ÄúS E R G E A N T D O L L A R‚Äù and ‚ÄúP A N C A K E H O U S E.‚Äù  I parked my Jeep Cherokee in the spot next to the dumpsters on the side of the Pancake House and flicked the cigarette in the general direction of the trash can.  As I opened the door an empty beer can rolled out and tumbled across the pavement.  I sighed, bent over and picked it up, tossing it into the dumpster before anyone could see.  The sun hadn‚Äôt quite made it over the horizon yet but was still too bright for my hung over eyes.  Blinking away a splitting headache, I noticed that the parking lot was empty, not even my manager‚Äôs car was parked by the back door.  I looked inside the diner and saw that the kitchen and dining room was empty.
	‚ÄúWhat the fuck?‚Äù  I said in confusion.
	Then I heard some rustling by the dumpster and saw the scraggily head of Cain pop out from behind one with scrambled eggs on his beard.  Cain was our resident crackhead that we allowed to kick it at the dumpster and occasionally fed him the extra food we had at the end of shifts in exchange for keeping away less savory crackheads.  He wasn‚Äôt the biggest guy around but you know what they say about the size of a dog in a fight and it surely fit Cain, he was a right bastard.
	‚ÄúHey!‚Äù  I called out to Cain, ‚ÄúWhere the hell is everybody?‚Äù
	Cain turned and studied the diner, ‚ÄúI dunno.‚Äù  Then he turned back to his scrounging.
	‚ÄúThanks for the help dick.‚Äù  I muttered before making my way inside the building and double checking that my car was locked.
	As I walked from the back room towards the front the sounds and smells of a kitchen invaded my senses.  The smell of oil, bacon and coffee filled my nose and twinged my unsettled stomach.  My feet slid ever so slightly as a mix of dish water, mop water and grease covered the chipped tile floor.  The hanging lights over the bar were still lit and all the flat surfaces were clean and spotless, there did seem to appear to be a mess behind the counter where someone dropped a plate of food and just left it for me to clean.
	‚ÄúFucking night shift.‚Äù  I muttered, grabbing a broom and mop.
	I idly wondered where my coworkers were at and hoped I hadn‚Äôt missed something important.  I really wish I hadn‚Äôt dropped my phone in the toilet full of puke the night prior so I couldn‚Äôt even text or call anyone.  After cleaning the mess, I let my body go through the familiar task of setting up for the day while my mind entered a pseudo meditative state where I thought of leaving and moving on to the next small town like I had been doing for the past few years.
	After about an hour, I finished all my opening duties and the duties of my still missing coworkers and really began to think that something was off.  Cain was usually one of the first people I saw everyday but he‚Äôs never been the only person I saw.  Come to think of it, I didn‚Äôt even see any cars on the small but (comparatively) highly trafficked road to the interstate right outside of the small town.  I went outside for a cigarette and I could definitely see tons of cars moving slowly down the interstate which made me feel a little better.  
	‚ÄúMaybe there was a bad accident and that‚Äôs caused everyone to be late.‚Äù  I said to myself knowing full well at least Alice, my manager, lived in town not too far from the motel I stayed at.  
	I made my way back inside and set to cooking myself some breakfast, seeing as no one was around to stop me or judge my voracious appetite.  Apparently, I wasn‚Äôt the only one that had this idea, as I had just plated myself a ‚ÄúTexas Pancake Melt‚Äù and double chunked, peppered and covered hashbrowns when Cain walked in, hesitantly looking around.  
Sighing, I said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs alright Cain, c‚Äômon in.  Want pancakes?‚Äù
He nodded and took a seat at the bar while I set to cooking him pancakes and filled a fresh pot of coffee for the two of us.  We didn‚Äôt usually let Cain inside or near the entrance during busy hours as he would harass exiting patrons for change and lick his lips at pigeons that lined the roof of our building.  The last time Cain had come in, he had blatantly taken half eaten food off of people‚Äôs plates and, in one case, took a french fry from a child‚Äôs hand.  Before long however, we were sharing a meal together in only slightly uncomfortable silence staring at the cracked brown tile and pictures of the original ‚ÄúPancake House‚Äù and owner.
‚ÄúSoo, ya‚Äôlike cooking boy?‚Äù  He said in his raspy (scottish?) accent.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not the worst job I‚Äôve had, certainly not the hardest or easiest but I never go hungry.‚Äù  I winced, looking at the frail frame of Cain but he didn‚Äôt seem to take offence to the faux pas.
‚ÄúHad many jobs?‚Äù  He asked.
‚ÄúI suppose,  been around and worked around.  I was in college then moved to oil work, pipe laying, circus clown here and a ranch hand there.‚Äù  
Cain nodded his head and raised his eyebrows in appreciation.
‚ÄúHave- you had many jobs?‚Äù  I asked, stumbling not sure how to ask or if to ask the question.
‚ÄúNope.‚Äù  He said simply. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve fought for, been fucked for or stole everything I‚Äôve ever had.‚Äù
Coffee shot into my nose at his casualness of that statement and Cain laughed at my discomfort.
‚ÄúBut, like you said, this gig ain‚Äôt too bad for me neither.  I fight for my dumpster and I get the occasional full pancake and hot cup of coffee.‚Äù  He said with a pleased smile that showed off his whole three teeth.
‚ÄúWell, where do you think everyone is at?‚Äù  I asked, blatantly changing the topic
‚ÄúLike I said earlier lad, I haven‚Äôt got the foggiest of fucking clues.  It‚Äôs not like I've got a phone or nuffin.  But, I did hear quit the fucking racket when all those stars fell from the sky but that was after I shot up so that‚Äôs a wash if it was real or not.‚Äù
I searched my foggy memory of last night trying to think of any ‚Äòstars falling‚Äô but all I could remember was a pretty caramel face, brown curls and an unearthly color growing from the depths that made me feel nauseous when I thought of it.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù  I said eventually. ‚ÄúI was plastered last night so I can‚Äôt exactly prove you wrong.‚Äù
We continued the rest of our meal in silence until Cain stood up from his stool.  ‚ÄúWell thank you for sharing a meal with me Mick, makes me feel like a man again but I got a couple of chores to do around the ole‚Äô abode.‚Äù
‚ÄúUh yeah, no problem Cain.  Guess I‚Äôll see you later.‚Äù  I said thinking of what kind of chores a crackhead has to do in a dumpster.
For the rest of the day, not a single soul got off the interstate.  No one entered the diner, the Sergeant Dollar behind the diner or the gas station across the street.  I noticed on one of my smoke breaks that neither store appeared to be open.  That made me anxious as I was running low on cigs and the Sergeant Dollar was the only place that got frequent shipments of Reds.  When I came back into the diner from that smoke break, there was an old box television and vcr on a cart in the middle of the kitchen.
‚ÄúNow what the fuck is this?‚Äù  I asked to the empty room.
I once again explored the diner and found no one inside and double checked the parking lot for a car and only saw my red Cherokee.  I went back inside and checked out the anomalous cart and found on top of the vcr was a vhs tape labelled, ‚ÄúThe Pancake House Apocalypse Guide.‚Äù  With growing confusion, I rolled the cart to the back office and plugged the ancient technology into an outlet and played the vhs tape, reminding me of when I was a kid at my grandparents‚Äô house watching old westerns.  The screen flickered green for a moment and went through the customary legal disclaimers and then the Pancake House company logo and my heart dropped, fearing a training video filled with monotone monologues and washed up 90s sitcom actors.  The screen flicked to a still photo of the exterior of a Pancake House and a tinny pompous male voice came out of the speakers. 
‚ÄúCongratulations loyal employee of the Pancake House corporation!  You have been selected to be a part of an elite cooking team to happily serve the weary survivors in the coming apocalypse!‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat the fuck.‚Äù  I said for the third (fourth?) time today.
‚ÄúAs you know Pancake House has held a long tradition to stay open 24/7 365 days a year rain or shine in as many locations as possible.  In the past, we have implemented Jump Teams to aid areas under natural disasters, well that has evolved into Star Teams because you sir are a star!‚Äù  
I idly thought about the likelihood of this being some elaborate prank by my coworkers because there was no way a corporation in the 2020s was going to use a definitive gender noun rather than a gender neutral one, no matter how tiresome it became.
‚ÄúIn these unprecedented times, we ask you, the best of our very best, to serve your company to the best of your abilities and we will provide you with everything you shall need.  The rest of this guide shall guide you through the apocalypse with ease and shall become your new holy doctrine.‚Äù
I rolled my eyes at hearing the cheery voice utter ‚Äúunprecedented,‚Äù I was so tired of hearing that fucking word.  It seemed like at every turn in my life there was another ‚Äúunprecedented‚Äù event that would ‚Äúirrevocably‚Äù change the world.  Y2k, 9/11, 2008 housing crash, 2012 the false apocalypse and Covid-19 of the 2020s.  To my generation, none of these really made any difference in our lives as we were either too young to understand or too poor for a financial crisis to affect our ramen noodle diet.
‚ÄúYour location had been deemed an ideal spot for weary survivors to stop by to rest and strengthen their will to continue on their travels through the coming storm and as such, it is your responsibility to maintain the store with dignity, grace and courtesy.  For when the dark days come to an end, you shall be rewarded greatly for your efforts and be heralded as a hero!‚Äù  Cheered the voice as clearly A.I. generated vignettes of cooks and servers served Mad Max extras complete with explosions filling the windows.  ‚ÄúYou are to complete weekly training via these informational videos which are going to be vital not only to your survival, but also providing excellent customer service! You will receive periodic shipments of supplies to insure that our customers get only the best we can provide them during these trying times of hardship.  Be sure that you don‚Äôt take more than what you need, otherwise you will be terminated‚Ä¶ HAHA!‚Äù  The voice finished that particular spiel with an almost manic laugh.    
‚ÄúI wonder what their definition of ‚Äòterminated‚Äô means during the apocalypse.‚Äù  I thought to myself before the video changed to a scene where an obese employee was gorging himself on bacon and pancakes, a gaunt family looked sadly at him through the window.  It wasn‚Äôt long before he was shot in the back of the head, spewing blood, brain matter and bone fragments across the table and window to the delight of the young children watching him.  The camera panned over to the shooter, revealing a suspiciously buff guy in a manager‚Äôs apron with an uncanny smile on his face before he holstered the strange pistol and pulled out a rag and broom.
‚ÄúAlrighty then.‚Äù  
‚ÄúBeing as your craven coworkers have abandoned their sacred posts to be with their FaMiLiEs.‚Äù  The voice said with venom and sarcasm.  ‚ÄúYou are charged with being the sole defender of your new holy land, as such, we expect you to not leave your post for longer than the standard one hour per eight hours for your lunch break.‚Äù  It said, mimicking a certain popular mouse‚Äôs laugh at the end.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got to be fucking kidding me, this can‚Äôt be real.‚Äù  I said incredulously.  ‚ÄúWhat do you expect me to do?  Sleep here in the back room?!‚Äù  This was all far too ‚ÄúBethesda.‚Äù
‚ÄúHaha! Yes!‚Äù  It said, seemingly in response to my question before continuing.  ‚ÄúThis may seem ridiculous at first, but rest assured that we are entirely serious, as proof we have provided your first adjusted check in the vhs case.  Please open the envelope now.‚Äù  
Obeying the questionably sentient vhs tape, I picked up the case for the vhs tape and sure enough, there was an envelope that I hadn‚Äôt seen when I pulled the tape out.  I took my car keys out of my pocket and opened the envelope carefully at first until the paper just started ripping down the middle and I gave up all pretense of care and tore it the rest of the way open like a neanderthal.  Pulling the check out of the massacred envelope, I read the five digit sum after the supposed nonexistent government had taken its ‚Äúshare‚Äù and my mouth opened and closed like a gasping fish.
‚ÄúQuite the sum eh?‚Äù  Asked the voice cheekily.  ‚ÄúWell fear not, you will be fairly compensated to make yourself a comfortable man for whatever civilization rises from the ashes of the previous.  This shall conclude your introductory training course for this week, please flip the tape over to the other side and play me in one week's time or if you are ever in desperate times.  Remember, duty and grace!‚Äù  It said before the screen went black.
I contemplated leaving right then and there to deposit the huge sum and getting out of Dodge myself.  Then I realized I could just mobile deposit the check with my phone.  Then, as I was reaching for my pocket, I remembered the fallen soldier, drowned in puke and water that I had laid to rest in a bag of rice, hoping to revive him.  Then I shook my head and decided that I would go on about my day as normal and ride around town to see if I can‚Äôt find anyone around.
A few hours passed and I occasionally checked the stinky fried phone and eventually gave up on it before tossing it, still in the bag, in a drawer of Alice's desk.  By then, my relief, George, should have arrived but there was no sign of him nor anyone else for that matter.
‚ÄúWell there‚Äôs nothing else for it I guess.‚Äù  I said to the empty room.
I briefly thought about trying to lock the doors to the building but realized I had never seen any such key for the doors let alone possess one as the diner was supposed to be open 24 hours a day.  
‚ÄúI‚Äôm leaving now!‚Äù I shouted, into the void that was the diner. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no longer my fault if someone doesn‚Äôt come to their own shift!‚Äù  I waited for a response, nothing came. 
‚ÄúGoodnight!‚Äù  I said before leaving the building.
Before I got into my car, I heard a strange sound almost like a trumpet or train horn emit a single long tone before ceasing.  I hadn‚Äôt recalled being able to hear the train from this side of town but it was the only thing I could think of.  I drove down the still empty two lane road headed back towards town, I kept glancing at my rearview mirror, watching the unmoving line of cars on the overpass.  I couldn‚Äôt make out any forms in the vehicles.  What I did see were enormous black clouds rolling fast from the east and the strong wind that buffeted the trees.  I saw dogs and cats either roaming the empty roads or sitting in the driveways, waiting on something or someone.  Something else was bothering me and I couldn‚Äôt place it until I got to the first red light and the light was out, the intersection was empty save for me so I just went on by.  The storm was rolling in fast now and the light of the sun was dimming to a drab gray, usually the street lights would have turned on by now, but they seemed to be on the fritz as well.  I idly wondered at how early we lost power seeing as the storm hadn‚Äôt even really gotten to the small town, but yet there wasn‚Äôt a single light in town that I could see.  I pulled into the local bank to cash out half the check and deposit the rest but the parking lot was empty and the lights were off as well.  
‚ÄúWhere the fuck is everybody at?‚Äù  I wondered, thinking I might have missed an evacuation order from last night.
Figuring there was nothing for it, I headed back to my humble abode that was my motel room on the same road the Pancake House was on.  It was on the seedier side of town and there was at least one form of degenerate hanging around the busy corner with a sign or hiked up skirt but not even the local homeless seemed to be home.  
As I was pulling into the parking lot of the motel, it started coming down the rain blistering the air as it was shot down by the storm, it felt like I was in an enormous car wash.
‚ÄúOf course it starts raining right when I‚Äôm about to get out of the car.‚Äù  I mumbled unhappily.
 I thought that would be the worst of it as the rain stung my skin as I ran to the safety of my door but halfway there, I started hearing wet and heavy splotching sounds all around me like paper bags filled with jello falling to the floor.  One such splotch landed directly in front of me and I saw that it was a fat frog, or at least used to be a frog.  The sudden arrival of the concrete sidewalk in the middle of its terminal velocity flight appeared to have bested the poor creature.  
‚ÄúJesus fucking Christ!‚Äù  I yelled as more splotches hit the ground and a shock of lightning struck in the distance marking my profane vulgarity.
I spared no time trying to guess how the frogs were yeeted at such speeds, instead, doubling my efforts at reaching the safety of my room.  I threw open the door to the shitty room and slammed it shut against the howling wind and nightmare inducing ‚Äúsplotching.‚Äù  I opened the curtains to the big pane glass window that looked over the parking lot and I saw the hundreds of little green bodies scattered throughout the area, their blood mixing into the rain water making a brown slurry of foul and would surely smell like hell once the storm passed.
‚ÄúWhat in the hell is going on?‚Äù  I thought, the sight of it all making me speechless.
I desperately tried to rationalize the situation, I was bordering the south and was sort of nearish to several bodies of water.  Hadn‚Äôt I heard of water spouts or tornadoes launching frogs and fish into the sky before?  If that was the case, there was surely going to be a lot of very happy birds and some pissed off DNR guy wondering where all his wildlife had been raptured to.  Something in my gut told me this wasn‚Äôt so mundane as a freak act of nature but my devoutly agnostic mind refused to give in and willfully chose to ignore this in favor of getting blitzed out of my gourd.
I turned to the pig sty of a room Past Mick had left for Future Mick to deal with knowing full well that neither would have to deal with the mess as Present Mick would, like always, be left with the shit end of the stick that neither of the other versions of myself seemed to end up with.  
‚ÄúWhere has my weed gone.‚Äù  I said in a goblin like tone, searching through all the nooks and crannies of the nest.
I eventually found my grinder and half a joint next to a thoroughly gunked pipe, so, lighting the joint I methodically cleaned the pipe and filled it back up with the rest of my precious herbs.  This specific strain was called ‚ÄúForbidden Fruit,‚Äù which obviously made it sound like it would be ‚Äúfruity‚Äù but just ended up tasting like every other weed strain I had tried.  The shit was REALLY good on the other hand and before I had even lit up the pipe, I was well on my way of completing my quest of becoming blitz.   That‚Äôs when I heard a strange noise coming from the exterior door.  It was a sort of ‚Äúthump-flisch-pause-thump-flisch‚Äù which intrigued my addled mind to no end.
In what I thought was an excellent Sherlock Holmes impression, I said.  ‚ÄúI must find out what is making that strange noise I do say!‚Äù before giggling to myself.
The journey to the door was long but I eventually made it and opened the door to reveal no one.  Then something hit my leg and I nearly jumped out of my skin as my gaze landed on an enormous Bull Frog.  I screamed like a little girl and jumped back into the threshold of my sanctuary.
‚ÄúHey calm it down won‚Äôchya?‚Äù  Said the Frog in a (Boston?) accent.
This of course sent me into another tizzy and it was official, my vibe was thoroughly harshed.
‚ÄúI said calm down, not cry like a sissy.  Now what‚Äôs a guy gotta do to get some good grub in this joint, eh?‚Äù  Asked the ridiculous little creature.
‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù  I began to ask as I peered over the sideways couch that had been overturned in my full blown retreat from the invader.
‚ÄúNevermind, I can see the buffet you‚Äôve laid out so helpfully.‚Äù  He said before bounding into the little kitchen area where there were indeed a hoard of flies circling the overflowing trash can.
The large frog was like a mix between an anti air gun from the WWII documentaries I used to watch in college and a cowboy with his magic lasso that caught everything it was thrown at.   Within minutes, the Bull Frog had wiped out the generations of flies that had built up over the past months.
‚ÄúMuch obliged Mick, you are indeed a kind host if I do say so myself.‚Äù  The frog said as he made his way back over to me, hopping from one piece of furniture to another.
‚ÄúTh-thank you?‚Äù I stammered.  ‚ÄúWhat are you doing here  Mr.-‚Äù
‚ÄúFrank, Frank the Fucking Frog at your service but you can just call me Fank for short.‚Äù  He said, finishing my sentence and bowing at his full name.
‚ÄúWell, Frank, what uh what seems to bring you to my humble abode.‚Äù  I squeaked.
‚ÄúOh I‚Äôm your trip sitter bro, and after you sober up you gotta get back to the Pancake House.‚Äù
‚ÄúWait what?‚Äù  I asked incredulously.
‚ÄúYou gotta get back to work numbfuck.  Don‚Äôt you remember that weird ass vhs tape?‚Äù
‚ÄúHow did-‚Äù  I began but my addled brain was not in any shape ready to go down a line of questioning with this frog.  I decided, for now, to just chill out with the strange frog, at least for now.
I righted the furniture that I had knocked over and gathered the pipe that had miraculously not lost its cargo in the commotion.  We sat there in silence for a while, I looked out the window at the storm while we puff puff passed.  Rain came down like a shower from the heavens washing the world‚Äôs sins down the storm drains to join filth we flush out of our houses.  The storm was picking up again, wind was violently whipping trees, trash cans were rolling down the streets and I even saw a trampoline fly over one of the houses.
‚ÄúI gotta admit, you‚Äôre handling this a lot better than I thought you was going to.‚Äù  Said Frank after a while.
‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù  I asked, taken off guard by the sudden statement.
‚ÄúGod you aren‚Äôt the quickest one are you?‚Äù  He replied.  ‚ÄúListen, you really gotta get back to your work as soon as you can.  They‚Äôll let this first instance to go by without punishment but if you stay out too long, they‚Äôll have to do something.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat do you mean?  Who‚Äôs they?‚Äù  I asked, interrupting him.
‚ÄúFor the love of God and all that is holy I‚Äôm trying to explain that to you you feckless fuck.‚Äù  He said sharply and turning a hairy (slimy? scaly?) eye on me.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôm just having a little trouble taking all this in seeing as you‚Äôre a fucking talking frog!  Now please enlighten me, shitty Kermit.‚Äù  I said hotly.
Frank seemed to take a breath to calm himself.  ‚ÄúPancake House needs you to do your job and to not leave the diner except on your OSHA mandated breaks, otherwise you are not going to like what they do to you.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhy the fuck do they care about OSHA?‚Äù  I asked.
‚ÄúHO-LEE FUCK.  Listen to me fucker!‚Äù  He practically screamed.  ‚ÄúGo, stay I don‚Äôt give a fuck.  I‚Äôm outta here, I held up my end of the bargain.‚Äù  He said before storming to the door and jumping on the doorhandle, which allowed the door to swing open from the wind.  
I sprung to my feet and fought to close the door and when I eventually did, I looked around and out the window but Frank was nowhere to be seen and I was no longer high.
I looked around the dark room again and sighed to myself.
‚ÄúAt least the Pancake House has power.‚Äù  I thought, ‚ÄúI could at least ride out the storm there until the power comes back on in town using the back up generators.‚Äù
So, I gathered up my meager belongings and braved the storm once again, dodging frogs as best I could.  In case you're wondering, driving down a road slick with frog bodies is not pleasant to say the least but I was soon pulling into the Pancake House Parking lot for the second time that day.  There wasn‚Äôt any sign of Cain outside and assumingly went inside to at least get out of the rain. 
Cain was indeed in the dining area, drinking a cup of coffee and he had guests.  He was seated at one of the booths playing cards with a family of raccoons?
‚ÄúHey Mick.‚Äù  Said Cain distractedly.
I wasn‚Äôt entirely sure if anything I was experiencing recently was even real so I decided to not engage with the odd scene and instead made my way to the back.  To my surprise, there was a freshly made cot large enough for me to sleep on more or less comfortably.
‚ÄúI guess this is home for now.‚Äù  I said, setting my belongings in the office and arranging the bedding.
For about the first week we didn‚Äôt see a single soul nor did the rain let up at all; the streets were absolutely flooded at this point and I was surprised that the store hadn‚Äôt been flooded either.   I entertained myself by cooking for Cain and myself, journaling and stealing cigarettes from the Sergeant Dollar next door.  I was going to eventually hit the gas station as I had already used up all of my favorite products.
Finally, during one of the evening shifts, I was sitting in the kitchen with my feet propped on another stool while bouncing a ball off the ceiling when I heard the door chime open and the muted sound of the storm became clearer.  I got up in such a hurry that both chairs toppled over and I smacked the ball right into one of the circular lights that dangled over the counter.  
	‚ÄúJesus Fu - I mean, Welcome to Pancake House!‚Äù  I blurted out while fumbling with the chairs.  
	Standing in the doorway was an older man with dark skin and the first hint of grey on an unshaven beard along with two dark skinned girls, the older looking preteens and the younger no older than nine.  The small family looked surprised and a little startled at my appearance and the father stepped forward in front of the two young girls.
	‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want any trouble now, we were just looking for some food.‚Äù  Said the man with just a hint of a southern accent.
	‚ÄúWell you‚Äôve come to the right place my friend.‚Äù  I said with what I had hoped to be a disarming smile and waved at the two girls.  ‚ÄúThis Pancake House location is still open and running and I would be more than happy to cook for you guys.‚Äù
	‚ÄúAre you serious?  I mean I know the old joke about the ‚ÄúPancake House Index‚Äù but y‚Äôall are staying open?  In this?‚Äù  He gestured vaguely to the apocalyptic storm behind him.  
	‚ÄúWell sir, if I‚Äôm being completely honest, I thought it was crazy too, but they‚Äôre betting on the long game and I guess I am too.‚Äù
	‚ÄúOookay then, I have some cash-‚Äù
	‚ÄúYou got any smokes?‚Äù  I asked, cutting him off in my haste to quench my addiction.
	Taken slightly aback, the man unconsciously reached into his jacket pocket, ‚ÄúY-yeah I‚Äôve got some wintergreen dip, if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre after.‚Äù
	Only slightly disheartened by the lack of cigarettes I said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got yourself a deal Mr‚Ä¶.‚Äù
	‚ÄúCall me Marcus,‚Äù Marcus said, handing me a can of Copenhagen Wintergreen.
	‚ÄúPleasure doing business with you Marcus, I‚Äôm Mick.‚Äù  I said cheerily.
	‚ÄúSo where are y‚Äôall from?‚Äù  I asked as I cooked healthy portions of bacon, eggs and a large stack of pancakes for everyone. 
	‚ÄúSavannah, we‚Äôre from Savannah, Georgia.‚Äù  
	‚ÄúDo you mind if I ask how it is over there?  And what it‚Äôs like out there in general?‚Äù
	Hesitantly, Macus said, ‚ÄúWell I guess I could tell you our story, it‚Äôs the least I could do for the first hot meal we‚Äôve had in days.‚Äù
	‚ÄúEat your fill first, then you can tell me if you don‚Äôt mind.‚Äù  I said setting plates down in front of hungry faces.  
	Marcus didn‚Äôt verbally respond but nodded his head as he chowed down on bacon.
	Cain, out of curiosity or boredom, decided to grace us with his presence wearing a komodo robe, fluffy bunny slippers, ‚ÄúJUICY‚Äù sweatpants that were absolutely drenched and a cane with a golden animal head as a handle.
	Marcus eyed the man suspiciously and his hand went tense on his thigh, the girls avoided looking at the admittedly strange man.  Cain, for the first time since I‚Äôd known him, read the room and sat a polite distance away and warmed his hands around a cup of coffee.
