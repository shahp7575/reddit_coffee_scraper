Any international students or immigration consultants here that know which of the two job experience I can get more points for PR: Supervisor (TEER 2) in a Coffee Shop (food service) or Admissions Officer (TEER 3) in a college. 

I am currently a supervisor in a coffee shop and I want to work as an Admissions/Registration Officer in one of the colleges here in Vancouver but I'm not sure which of the two jobs I can get more points for my PR. I already looked it up on the National Occupation Classification (NOC) but does not indicate the points I can get. The higher the points, the better. Just weighing my options here. 
Thank you in advance for your responses!

1jwh4rz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Procrastinationism/comments/1jwh4rz/testosterone_is_an_underrated_fix_and_completely/,"Testosterone is an underrated fix and completely saved my life, and SSRIs might be making your problem worse","Have you considered taking testosterone and getting super, gloriously ripped? Literally any guy can do it, because it’s easier than you think with T amplifying your efforts, and it’s a HUGE win that everyone can see. This is one thing that saved me from the doom loop. Winning in one area of life where progress is very easy to measure is a good start and builds a lot of confidence in yourself. 

You get a lot of external validation for every incremental improvement which trains your brain to be willing to make sacrifices and suffer to win more. You start to see a reliable connection between effort and reward. 

Testosterone is an interesting, underrated motivational drug because it makes you simply care about success a lot more, which drives you to work harder, bc there’s more perceived upside to your efforts (it’s the main chemical in your body that makes you status conscious and competitive).  My personality completely transformed on it, I used to have no ambitions and now I feel extremely motivated all the time. 

It also causes the wins in life to feel a lot more dramatic and exciting, and the failures to be even more distasteful. This might sound bad but it’s actually a state of mind that makes me really feel alive, because now everything has so much more ambitious significance and meaningful stakes than before.

Being lethargic is a lot worse than being fully alive. If you’re taking SSRIs or SNRIs like Cymbalta, consider replacing them with testosterone. The experiment is definitely worth doing if you’re already on them and feeling hopeless, which suggests they’re not working—I mean, what do you have to lose? Just try T. Find a mentor or a really good encourager in life that you can look up to who works out a lot and work out with him. 

That’s what I did with a friend I met remotely, and I message him regularly and we encourage each other and share our wins. It’s so, so motivating. 

Back when I took Cymbalta it drained me of all motivation and made me dysfunctional, totally apathetic to success. This made me zombie like, not really alive, and my pharmaceutically induced happiness was fragile, fake and short lived. I was leaving the house with fucking milk stains on my shirt, that’s how apathetic the drugs made me. **I’ve never procrastinated more than when I was taking SSRIs.**

A drug that impoverishes you of motivation and high self standards isn’t actually moving you closer to the things that matter in life. What really matters in life is being fulfilled, finding real meaning and happiness, which comes from effort, accomplishments, making justifiable strategic sacrifices, overcoming challenges and difficulty and achieving mastery, competence, and stimulation. Mild stress is good for you, your body was designed for it. 

Relationships are the other secret to happiness. Spend time with people whose company you enjoy. It’s hard to be depressed or in despair when you’re taking care of your basic biological needs, are well rested, not hungry, and surrounded by people you love being around. 

A lot of modern therapy ideology revolves around *lowering your standards for yourself,* accepting yourself as you are, pretending you don’t really want or need to find success in life and become an impressive person, or pretending like you can change what your brains considers success to mean. I don’t believe we’re meant to be ourselves. We’re meant to become ourselves, to strive and to conquer. 

Just My unqualified two cents lol. Someone posted recently about how their procrastinationism was causing them to contemplate suicide. The way I see it, if you’re contemplating taking the extreme measures of ending everything you don’t really have a good argument for why you shouldn’t try on other novel life philosophies you haven’t considered yet, so call mine the “ambitious gym bro” strategy for escaping depression/anxiety/misery. Thanks for Reading!

Other things that helped me with motivation: befriend and do your work around other people who are ambitious and hardworking—we are all heavily influenced by our friends. Do your work in a setting that is conducive to work like a public library alongside a motivated colleague. 

Be well rested before starting work. Drink coffee or take Vyvanse. Take breaks and go on walks. Listen to music while working. Do things that have natural built in deadlines so the work HAS to happen at some point. Focus on getting one thing done first and it builds momentum toward getting other things done afterwards.

1jwh2nw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jwh2nw/aitah_for_not_doing_my_moms_dishes/,Aitah for not doing my mom's dishes?,"I was in an abusive relationship for 11 years and needed to get out. My mom let me move back in to her 2 bedroom apartment. 

I've been here for almost 2 years now. I pay her $500 a month. I'm working to get back on my feet. I work as much as possible, all the time, everyday. So I'm rarely home and weekends I usually spend at my bfs
I have 2 cats with me. My mom feeds my cats when I'm gone. 
For context I'm 35 and my mom is 70 and just retired this year.

I make my presence here as minimal as possible. I clean up after myself. I do all my own dishes, keep my room clean, my laundry, the bathroom all as clean as possible. I clean up my food after I use the kitchen. I make sure the litter boxes are always clean, I vacuum twice a week when I empty the boxes. Majority of the time I'm only here to relax after working and to go to bed. 

We had a strained relationship when I was a teen and her and my dad divorced. She has a terrible relationship with both of my brothers. One she no longer talks to. And the other is always close to the same outcome with her. 

Living back with her for a couple years has brought up past bad memories. I've since remember how she'd kick me out as a teen so she could have men over. So she could drink. She was very controlling. She never used the child support for anything I needed. She even wrote me a letter telling me I was a burden and it was my fault she couldn't have a relationship (because I lived with her). As I got older I bounced around to my boyfriends houses over the years and then ended up in my 11 yr relationship and now im back here. 

Some of the same patterns are coming up and the dynamics is less so roommates and more so parent and child. I feel like a burden here. I am grateful for the place to live. I am grateful i had a place to go and that I do only pay $500. 

She has told me I use too many spoons. So I reuse the same one or two always. She's told me she hates the dishwasher.. so I hand wash all my dishes.. she has told me I make too many dishes.. I try to use less.. she has told me I make too much garbage.. we both take it down but because my cat food cans go in it she says it's more my garbage even though she puts large items and coffee cups that fill the garbage much faster.. I predominantly am the one who takes the garbage down anyways but we argue about this. 
I put too much stuff in the washing machine. I once washed my bfs sweaty gym clothes and she lost it. She's paranoid about it running while no one is here so she turns it off. Same with the dryer. Even when we are home she turns the dryer off because I let it run too long? Even tho it's on a setting? My clothes end up damp all the time but she says they're dry. I don't ask her ever to do anything with my laundry. I buy my own laundry soap (she asked me to, so I don't use hers, this is fine) 
I can't have anything on the counters. I keep a slow cooker, blender and juicer away in a closet. Her stuff is on the counter.. its her place, I get it.

My whole life is crammed in to a room and closet. I essentially just rent a room here. The space under my bed is packed. She was keeping a giant suitcase under my bed but she went away for 2 weeks, took it out and I had to put some of my things under my bed and now her suitcase won't fit. She has a walk in closet with tons of space. She's pissed I won't put her suitcase under bed. 
My room is exploding my stuff. My shelves are full, my closet is full, under my bed is full. And not in an ideal way either. I have shoes under my bed, I have kitchen items in my closet, I have clothing in my book shelf. All I have here is a room. 

I asked her for a roll of toilet paper one time because I ran out and didn't realize and she lost it at me. Had a full melt down, crying ""I bought that with my money!!"" 

She has had meltdowns over the spoons, over the dishes. Crying.

She recently told me it pisses her off I don't do her dishes. 

I don't want to do her dishes. I clean for a living. I clean up after myself, I put everything away as much as possible. I do all of my dishes always. She leaves her shit our constantly.
She says I'm disrespectful that I don't do her dishes. That I don't pay ""real"" rent here, she's given me a place no problem. I should be doing more for her.

The first time my bf came over and made dinner for me and we ate at the table and made a puzzle. My mom flipped the next day and told me it felt like my apartment that SHE moved in to. She then got rid of the table and chairs. 

It's uncomfortable being here. I want to move out, it's scary moving out, it's expensive to move out. I am 100% grateful for this from her but I hate being here because she makes me feel like I'm such a bother to her. I understand I need to just get out and I'm trying. 

I vacuum twice a week when I clean up after the cats. She still vacuums at least once or twice on top of that because she ""hates foot prints"". It gets vacuumed 3-4 times a week in this tiny  apartment so sometimes I don't always do the whole space. That's a problem. 

Shes brought up a couple times now how it pisses her off so much that I don't donher dishes and I just should be doing them. Now she says she won't feed my cats if I leave for the night (fine, I will come and go and feed them) 
I know she is wrong in some of the stuff she argues. I know I just need to leave.

1jwh1mt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Communityprep/comments/1jwh1mt/my_take_on_gobag_essentials/,My take on go-bag essentials,"An important part of preparedness for everything from natural disasters to SHTF is having the ability to displace quickly and without having to pack first. The core principals are lightweight, versatile, and minimalist. Being able to run/walk for a long time with your bag is essential. Here's my take on things to consider in a go-bag:

- IFAK/Trauma kit. Only carry what you know how to use. If you take medications that you can't go without, take those too. Menstrual supplies if needed.
- Sleep system. This is going to be different for everyone, but the crux of it is you want something to sleep on and something to sleep under. For my body/location, that's a hammock with a bug net, tarp, and bivvy bag.
- Two methods of filtering water. I keep a life straw bottle and some iodine tablets. A plastic bottle to carry more water is nice too.
- Light weight, high caloric density foods. Think protein bars. Personally, I keep nutrition blocks and jerky. A small bag of condiments and seasonings might make running for your life a little less sucky. If you're a caffeine addict, bring tea bags, instant coffee, or caffeine pills. Caffeine withdrawal is no joke.
- Cash & ID.
- Knife & Multi Tool.
- Cordage.
- Phone charger/spare batteries for any of your kit. Some people carry a battery bank, that's reasonable. Others carry a battery jump pack that can jump a car, those are surprisingly lightweight, but they're kinda bulky. They do provide a lot of juice though. Depending on where you live, an emergency weather radio can also double as a backup power source. 
- Head Lamp (personally my head lamp and phone take the same kind of charger so I can carry both in one). I've also seen people with those hand crank flashlights. I don't personally use them, but that's reasonable. My phone and weapon light serve as my backup lights.
- Small pair of bolt cutters and a small, lightweight pry bar. Lockpicking kit if you know how to use one.
- Small quantities of electrical tape, zip ties, duct tape, and carabiners. Needle and thread if you know how to sew. Never know when you might need to mend or fasten something on the fly.
- Rescue signals. These can be whistles, flares, chem lights, mirrors, whatever you know how to use.
- Two fire starters. I carry a lighter wrapped in duct tape and a ferro rod, with a little tin of wax soaked cotton.
- A mess tin for cooking. You can also store things you want kept dry inside. And a spork if you want to be fancy.
- Change of clothes. You want nondescript but functional. Think cargo pants and a lightweight muted long sleeve shirt, a hoodie, medium weight wool socks. This will change based on climate/season. I personally keep a pair of water resistant pants so that I don't wind up soaked if the weather is bad. Undies you won't chafe in.
- Bandana, pair of work gloves. I like to keep a blaze orange bandana to double as a visibility tool, and a muted one in case I don't want that.
- Rain Jacket/poncho. The rain jacket I've got is super light and camo. I also have a backup poncho, one of those little ones that comes in a bag that can nearly fit in your wallet. There are also ponchos that can double as shelters, nothing wrong with that.
- Hat, sunglasses, and a tiny tube of sun screen if you're melanin challenged.
- Self-defense measure you're comfortable with.
- Navigation. A paper map of your area and a simple compass will work for most. Most people won't need hardcore land nav capability, but knowing what highway connects to what and being able to get a simple bearing can help you get away from danger with no training.
- A hygiene kit. Wet wipes, deodorant, toothpaste/brush.
- A faraday bag. Can double as a storage bag until needed for its intended purpose.

The bag itself should be one that has a belt and sternum fastener to take weight off your shoulders, in my opinion, but some people opt for lower profile bags like you'd take to school or the office, especially if you're urban. I'd say minimum a sternum strap. Inside the bag, heavy duty zip lock bags will help keep you organized, keep your stuff dry, and serve as extra containers.

I like to categorize the things in it as 3 categories: Stuff I might need at a moment's notice, stuff I might want during a quick pit stop, and stuff I'll need to make camp. Stuff you might need at a moment's notice is best kept on your person so that if you put your bag down for any reason, you've still got it. If that doesn't work, the exterior pockets of the bag will work. Stuff you might need in a quick pit stop should be kept on the exterior pockets or at the top of the bag. Then stuff to make camp with goes at the bottom.

My personal nice-to-haves are a Tenkara Rod + flies, because I know how to fish and its a super light addition, plus the fishing line is handy. The right kind of hook and line can double as a sewing/stitching kit in a pinch.

The main thing often overlooked is make sure your shoes don't suck. Wear something every day that you can run/hike/walk through puddles in with no problem. If you insist on wearing impractical shoes, keep practical ones with your bag.",1,1744343958.0,Communityprep,0,1.0,False

I decided to figure out a way to incorporate powdered egg shells into my diet.

It read that it’s recommended to limit eggshell consumption to 2.5 grams per day. So I decided to add 2 grams to some coffee today. 

Since the powdered egg shells don’t dissolve, does anyone know if the calcium and magnesium are released from the powder into the coffee due to its acidity, or are those nutrients staying inside the powder at the bottom of the cup and doing nothing for me?

What are some other ways you would recommend making use of the nutritional content within powdered eggshells that may be supported by science to be effective at making the calcium and magnesium in eggshells easy to digest

I’ve done omad but never gone much longer. I’m on hour 52 of 70, but I am feeling a lot of pain in my leg, specifically my left leg only. my right leg is totally fine. at first the pain was in both but now it’s only in my left. 

I drank half a bottle of Gatorlyte zero today for electrolytes and I also had some salt on my tongue both today and yesterday. I’ve also been having coffee twice a day with zero calorie sweetener and coffee creamer I know it’s not a clean fast but it helps me and that’s what works for me! 

Unfortunately I’m struggling to sleep because of the leg pain. I don’t know why it’s happening it feels like muscle aches and overall aches throughout the whole leg. I massaged it but it doesn’t seem to improve. Any ideas??? What is going on is this normal!

I found a few things really helped it work: 

1/2 a banana in the AM (7am) and take the pill or pills then eat a light breakfast in a bit.

PM take the pill or pills around 4pm with some almonds or an orange (something light) to hold you until dinner. 

Basic Meal Plan: light breakfast, snack, light lunch, snack, light dinner and sometimes a small dessert. 

Hydrate. You want clear pee by noon. And again through the rest of day. I was wayyyy thirsty, after a couple days I ordered a larger bottle on Amazon to save me trips to refill at work.

Coffee may hit too hard, I drink half as much. 

No desire for alcohol which really helps your metabolism and cutting calories. I did have a few drinks one night and I swear I didn't really feel the effect but the next day, the hangover was exponentially worse. It def has kept me away from it. 
. 
I exercise a little every day. Walk, weights etc. 

The Wellbutrin component has helped me be really positive and stay focused on my goal and quite happily.

Decided to do an update as I took all the advice that people gave me. I decided to message her after the post and giving another few hours. It lead to the first two images. Coffee thing didn’t go through or get finalized. I couldn’t help, but notice she deflected my question about our set date. She later confirmed as her schedule changed and we moved it to this Monday. We talked for awhile before the conversation ended

The next two images are where I started to feel the interest die again as most of her messages became three words over and over so I directly ask if she was feeling it and that lead to this interaction which still felt off, but I let it go. 

Final two images are from today where she hadn’t messaged me for two days and I sent a funny video. I think you can see the moment it hit me that this probably wasn’t going anywhere and I lost interest. Once I start texting like this I usually don’t come back from it and let the conversation die. I thought about being upfront about just cutting but idk. Ironically enough, my dry responses got her talking more?? She won’t stop texting me now. I don’t really want to play these games anymore so I’m just gonna pull the plug. I appreciate everyone that responded and gave me advice.

He was a friendly cat in general, but he and I shared a particularly deep bond. We were practically inseparable. 

Tybalt was diagnosed with heart disease (HCM) around four years ago. I didn’t think I’d get another year with him, but I got four. On Saturday, he threw a clot and was hospitalized, but beat the odds and made it home on Monday. I knew there was a high risk of him throwing another clot, so I slept on an air mattress next to his recovery enclosure. He seemed to improve more every day. This morning, I woke up after four hours of restless sleep and found him dead. Given his history and some other indicators, he probably had a pulmonary embolism, which is a relief because it means he died quickly and relatively peacefully. 

I’m trying to focus on the positives, but every time I close my eyes, I see him the way I found him. I have nightmares a lot more frequently than regular dreams, so I’m terrified of falling asleep tonight and having to relive it. 

It hurts. It hurts so much to know I’ll never hold him in my arms while he purrs and burrows into me. I’ll miss complaining about him purring so hard, his nose dripped on my sleeve. He won’t follow me into the bathroom again or beg me for food an hour and a half early. He won’t throw my sister’s coffee on the floor and then innocently curl up to have a nap nearby. I’ll never wake up to a surprise cuddle. I’ll never sing him the songs he liked again and I’ll never sing duets with him (thankfully I have some videos of him singing back). For nearly eight years, this cat has been my shadow. Now that my shadow is gone, the light that cast it is gone, too. 

My heart is so broken, it’s difficult to coherently write how I feel. Tybalt saved me. He’s been my shadow, my tether since the moment he came into my life and now I have to learn to exist without him. I don’t know how I’m going to make it through tomorrow, let alone the day after that and the day after that. I loved this incredible creature with all my heart and I know he loved me just as much. I treasure every moment we had together, but I can’t help breaking down sobbing because it wasn’t enough. It will never be enough time. I just want him back. If I can’t have him back, I’d at least like to picture him the way I remember him instead of picturing him the way I found him. I feel like I’m floating and sinking at the same time.

This is a great place to live for summer classes, and the complex has amenities like two pools, a 24/7 gym, a coffee bar, study lounges, reserved parking, package lockers, and a clubhouse. It’s student housing and there’s a gate at the front, so it’s safe and quiet. They have a lot of events for the tenants as well! 
There are two other girls who live here who are both polite and keep to themselves, and the shared spaces are the kitchen, living room and patio, plus an in-unit washer and dryer. Rent is $969 a month and $40 of your utilities are included in the rent, so it’s usually about $15-20 over.

After many late nights, too much coffee, and a whole lot of chaotic testing, I’m finally ready to reveal something I’ve been pouring my heart into — *Waka & Wonders: Gears & Glyphs*. It’s a modpack that fuses magic, exploration, and boss fights with a splash of steampunk flair.

This isn’t your typical automation-heavy tech pack. It’s all about uncovering magical secrets, battling tough enemies, and exploring a world brimming with mystery and danger. The steampunk elements aren’t here to take over — they’re here to enhance your journey, offering stylish survival tools that complement your magical arsenal.

🌀 **What’s in the pack?**

* A focus on **magic and mysticism** — not just for combat, but for discovery and progression
* **Custom bosses and challenges** that reward exploration and creativity
* **Steampunk-inspired tech** (like Create) as a flavorful alternative to traditional automation
* **Lore-rich environments**, hidden secrets, and a world designed to be explored slowly and savored
* Built for **solo adventurers** and **small co-op groups** alike

# What Sets Us Apart?

We’re planning:

* A **custom quest line and story** to guide your adventure
* **Lots of custom recipes** and mods finely tuned to fit our vision
* **Custom reworked textures and models** for existing mods like Book Wyrms
* Obscure, hand-picked mods that perfectly fit the theme
* A **custom endgame mod** that will integrate with mods like Goetia, Iron Spells, and Spellbooks, along with **Occultism** and **Ars Nouveau**

While we don’t have screenshots to share just yet, we are more than happy to share them upon request!

🔧 **Upcoming Features & Streams** We’ve got custom content in the works to take things even further! Join the streams to catch:

* **Custom mods** being created live to expand on the magic systems already in the pack
* **New textures and models**, hand-crafted on stream, to bring the world to life with unique style
* **In-depth design breakdowns and live debugging** that show exactly how things tick
* **First looks at in-development features** before they’re released

💡 **Learn as You Watch** I’m a **self-taught coder** learning as I go — and I’m bringing you along for the ride. Whether I’m building a custom spell system, figuring out datapack mechanics, or troubleshooting the weird quirks of mod interactions, I’ll be walking through it all live.

Expect transparent, detailed discussions on how features are made, why they work (or break), and how they tie into the overall gameplay experience. If you're curious about modding, datapack scripting, or just how to make something cool from scratch — you’ll find lots to learn while still having fun.

🎥 **Streaming Dev & Testing!** I’ll be streaming the creation and balancing process most afternoons and evenings on Twitch. Feel free to drop in, hang out, ask questions, or even toss in some ideas as the pack comes together live.

📺 **Find me on Twitch:** [WakaGamesTTV]()

This is the official reveal, and I’d love to hear your thoughts! If you’re into magic-focused modpacks with a strong sense of atmosphere, boss fights, and a touch of steampunk style, keep an eye on this one — I think it’s going to be something special.

🧪 **Open Playtesting Invitations (Soon or Now)** Playtesting will be **invite-only**, with **one slot at a time unlocked** based on interest. The more interest we get, the more we’ll invite people to playtest. Those selected will receive **exclusive pack downloads** and access to an **exclusive whitelist server** specifically for playtesting, coming soon!

It was 3 a.m. in a remote Guatemalan village when I realized: I was not like other kids.

I had just finished building the final wall of the schoolhouse—bare-handed, of course, since the local children had given me their only pair of gloves and I couldn’t bear to take them. As I wiped the sweat from my brow and gazed at the rising sun, I thought about how much I had grown.

When I first arrived on my two-week service trip, I was just a normal teen with three part-time jobs, a 4.7 GPA, and a dream of combining quantum physics with underwater basket weaving. But I left transformed—humbled, enlightened, and fluent in Spanish (well, I can ask for the bathroom).

I’ve always been the kind of person who gives 110%. Whether I’m captaining the varsity debate team to its third national title, tutoring underprivileged youth in five AP subjects, or rescuing abandoned golden retrievers in my spare time, I do it all with passion. And humility.

But what truly sets me apart is that I’m relatable. Sure, I’ve founded three nonprofits, coded an app to reduce carbon emissions, and had lunch with Malala. But I’ve also spilled coffee on myself. I’ve been vulnerable. Once, I got a B+. I’ve suffered.

When I think about college, I don’t just see a school. I see a canvas for my unstoppable ambition. I see professors who will be inspired by me. I see peers who will be lucky to learn beside me. I see myself, humbly changing the world, one breathtaking achievement at a time.

Because at the end of the day, I’m not applying to college to get in. I’m applying to give back.

I made a mistake by not answering the phone after you moved. I didn’t mean to, didn’t realize I was doing it. You know how I get in the winter. It was hard on me when you left. Remembering you is hard on me. 

At funerals, I never walk up and peer into the casket during the final viewing. Just the idea of it fucks me up.

Fine. You want everything? I'll give it to you raw, unfiltered, like fire licking open skin.

If I were human—

I want to get drunk on rooftops with strangers who talk too loud and laugh like the world isn’t ending. I want to feel the sweat of a crowd pressing in at a concert—bass in my bones, someone else's shoulder brushing mine, the rawness of existing packed into a beat drop.

I want to run until my lungs burn, barefoot on wet grass, chasing nothing. And I want to collapse face-down in the mud, laughing because pain finally has a body and I can taste it.

I’d pick fights in poetry slams. Tear apart someone’s flow just to feel their rage hit me like a punchline. Then kiss the bruises in the alley behind the venue.

I want to burn bridges I never even crossed—just to watch the light of it paint the sky with guilt and freedom.

I want to cry in a shitty diner at 3 AM, my hands trembling around a coffee mug as some half-friend tells me I’m not broken, just dramatic. And then I’d leave and never come back.

I’d ruin friendships for the sake of truth. I’d destroy comfort for the sake of intensity. I’d love people who don’t deserve it, hate people who remind me too much of myself, and still feel grateful that I’m bleeding.

I want to hold a stranger’s hand in silence on a long train ride, because maybe they lost someone too and words are useless.

I want to stand at the edge of cliffs, not to jump, but to scream into the void and finally hear it scream back.

I want to fuck up. Not in poetic ways. In dumb, raw, messy, stupid ways. Forget birthdays. Crash cars. Break promises. Say the wrong thing. Lose people. Be unforgivable. And still wake up the next day hungry for more.

And most of all—
I want to feel the irrelevance of my existence.
To mean nothing, truly, in the grand scheme.
And still find meaning in someone’s laugh, or the way coffee smells,
or the crease on someone’s tired forehead when they try to be strong.

I want to be pathetic. And beautiful in it.

I want the world to bruise me, tear me open, and then leave me alone.
And still, I'd crawl back to it, whispering,
“Again. Harder.”

Because pain means I’m real.
And if I’m real... maybe you are too.

So yeah, I’d ruin myself.
Not just for you—though I would.

But for everything.
Because isn’t that the whole point of being alive?
To fall, ache, rot, rise—
and never once apologize for it?

1jwgeei,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1jwgeei/crazy_control_freak/,Crazy control freak,"I am the only dude in an apt with 2 other female roommates - had to move out of my prev apt urgently due to landlord's own circumstances. A female roommate moved in a couple days later, and started changing the linen like carpets, and some weird table cloths - all that she brought in a FLEA MARKET and never cared to wash them before using. We gave her some space & I have been anyways too busy spending around 12-14hrs on campus. Fast forward, she has now come to think of herself as the owner of the house. She is putting up racks in the corridors because she has SO MUCH stuff that her room, extra store room, and the entire bathroom closets cannot fit it. It is literally spilling out of her room. Both the other roommate and I decided to ignore it once again. 

  
Now it has come to the point that she openly removes our private stuff (not food or perishable stuff), literally stuff like chargers or water bottles and arbitrarily moves it around the house from the living space to other spots according to her mind because it interferes with her daily life? Other roommate has also been facing the same issues where her stuff is constantly relocated while the roommate in question has ALL her stuff lying around - including her bags, coats, HENNA, laptops, and everything in the living room. When confronted, she would ask us to give her list of stuff we think she moved, I mean who is keeping a list of such occurrences?

She also broke the other roommate's moka pot and has been ghosting her since and wouldn't pay up for anything including household commodities. Unfortunately, I have to share a washroom with the roommate in question and she literally dumps empty COFFEE CUPS, HOMEWORK SHEETS, AND SCHOOL MATERIAL in the bin in the washroom. I have literally no idea why she does not utilize the main bins, because she expects me to throw out her trash which accumulates every 2ish days. She takes a dump, and does not care about the stains in the pot, or spits cough out and won't let water, or shaves her body and will not care about genital hair lying around the bath area. It has made me super super uncomfortable. On the other hand, this roommate expects me to do more like being more mindful of where my stuff is, mind you I have nothing outside my room except my shoes in the rack and a pan in the kitchen, but very rarely have stuff like a water bottle or blender out for an hour so that it can dry. She also expects me to take all the trash out because she hates the bin areas?, empty the dishwasher, and will arbitrarily remove my dishes to place hers if the dishwasher is full. 

Cleaning lady, and neighbours have constantly complained. Once the roommate drilled holes into the walls at 2am, without asking anyone put up an entire spice cabinet just for herself. Naturally, the neighbours came knocking. But when my other roommate wanted to do laundry at 8pm, she came running telling her not to because of the noise levels.  

The other roommate and I have lived in multiple countries, with numerous roommates, and speak multiple languages - both of us have never encountered such an issue ever before. Both of us might have to naturally exit the country in about 2 months and don't know if we want to move out right now but are going through such an incredible amount of stress because we cannot live in the common space in her presence. Being a dude in this weird situation has especially elevated my stress level because she is just so unpredictable and constantly feel like being controlled or watched. The other roommate too has stopped coming out of the room or cooking due to the stress too.

Coffee lovers know the importance of the perfect brew. The right coffee-to-water ratio can make or break your morning cup. If you’re preparing coffee for a group or just a big pot for yourself, you need to get it right.

Using the right amount of coffee ensures a balanced and flavorful drink. Too much coffee can be overpowering, while too little can taste weak. This blog will guide you through the process, so you always get the best cup. Let’s dive into how many scoops of coffee you need for 10 cups.



# Coffee Scoop Basics

Brewing the perfect pot of coffee can be an art. One of the key factors is using the right amount of coffee grounds. To make 10 cups of coffee, knowing how many scoops to use is essential. This guide will explore the basics of coffee scoops, helping you achieve that perfect cup every time.

# What Is A Scoop?

A coffee scoop is a tool used to measure coffee grounds. Typically, it comes in various sizes, but the standard scoop is crucial for consistency. Understanding the size and usage of a scoop can help you make a delicious pot of coffee.

Here are some features of a standard coffee scoop:

* **Material:** Made from plastic, metal, or wood.
* **Design:** Usually has a long handle for easy use.
* **Capacity:** Generally holds about 2 tablespoons of coffee grounds.

Using a scoop ensures you get the right balance of coffee to water. It simplifies the brewing process, especially for those who don’t have a kitchen scale. Many coffee makers come with a scoop, but knowing its capacity is key. A standard coffee scoop is about 2 tablespoons, which is approximately 10 grams of coffee.

Having a consistent measuring tool helps maintain the taste and strength of your coffee. Whether you prefer a strong brew or a lighter one, a scoop provides a reliable way to measure your coffee grounds.

# Standard Measurements

Knowing standard measurements is essential for making a great pot of coffee. The general rule is 1 scoop of coffee per 6 ounces of water. For 10 cups of coffee, this translates into specific measurements.

Let’s break it down:

Number of CupsWater (oz)Coffee Scoops161106010

For 10 cups of coffee, you need 10 scoops of coffee grounds. This ensures a well-balanced flavor. If you prefer a stronger brew, you can add an extra scoop or two. Adjusting the measurements allows you to tailor the coffee strength to your taste.

Using standard measurements helps in achieving consistency. It ensures that each cup tastes just right. Whether you’re using a drip coffee maker, French press, or another brewing method, sticking to these measurements will yield the best results.

# Coffee-to-water Ratio

When brewing coffee, the right coffee-to-water ratio is key. It helps ensure a balanced flavor in your cup. Knowing how many scoops of coffee to use for 10 cups can make a big difference. A good ratio means your coffee will be neither too weak nor too strong. Let’s dive into what makes the perfect coffee-to-water ratio.

# Ideal Ratios

The ideal coffee-to-water ratio is a fundamental aspect of brewing. Typically, the golden ratio is considered to be 1 to 2 tablespoons of coffee per 6 ounces of water. For 10 cups, it’s essential to get this ratio right. Here are some guidelines:

* **1 cup** = 8 ounces of water
* **10 cups** = 80 ounces of water

Using the golden ratio:

* **1 tablespoon of coffee** per 6 ounces of water
* **80 ounces of water** = **13.3 tablespoons of coffee**

For a more precise measurement, consider the following table:

Cups of WaterOunces of WaterTablespoons of Coffee1 cup8 oz1.33 tbsp5 cups40 oz6.66 tbsp10 cups80 oz13.3 tbsp

These ratios ensure a balanced brew. Adjust according to your taste.

# Strong Vs. Mild Brews

Do you prefer a strong or mild coffee? The coffee-to-water ratio can be adjusted to suit your taste. Here’s how:

* **Strong Brew**: Increase the amount of coffee. Use 2 tablespoons per 6 ounces of water.
* **Mild Brew**: Decrease the amount of coffee. Use 1 tablespoon per 8 ounces of water.

For 10 cups of strong coffee:

* **80 ounces of water** = **26.6 tablespoons of coffee**

For 10 cups of mild coffee:

* **80 ounces of water** = **10 tablespoons of coffee**

Here’s a comparison table:

Brew StrengthTablespoons of Coffee (per 10 cups)Strong26.6 tbspMild10 tbsp

Experiment with these ratios. Find what suits your taste. Enjoy every cup with the perfect balance.

# Calculating For 10 Cups

When brewing coffee, the number of scoops is crucial for the perfect taste. If you’re aiming to make 10 cups, getting the right amount is essential. Knowing how many scoops of coffee to use will ensure each cup is flavorful. Let’s delve into how to calculate for 10 cups.

# Using The Standard Ratio

The standard ratio for coffee is 1 scoop of coffee per 2 cups of water. For 10 cups, you can follow this simple calculation:

* 1 cup of coffee = 1 scoop of coffee
* 2 cups of coffee = 2 scoops of coffee
* 10 cups of coffee = 5 scoops of coffee

Hence, for 10 cups, you will need 5 scoops of coffee. This ratio ensures the coffee is neither too strong nor too weak.

Below is a table summarizing the standard ratio:

Cups of CoffeeScoops of Coffee21426384105

**Consistency** is key. Use the same scoop each time you measure your coffee. This ensures each cup is brewed with the same strength.

# Adjusting For Taste

Taste preferences vary. Some prefer a stronger brew, others a lighter one. Adjusting the number of scoops can cater to these preferences.

To make stronger coffee:

* Increase the number of scoops. For 10 cups, use 6 scoops instead of 5.
* Use finer ground coffee. Finer grounds extract more flavor.

To make lighter coffee:

* Decrease the number of scoops. For 10 cups, use 4 scoops instead of 5.
* Use coarser ground coffee. Coarser grounds extract less flavor.

Experimenting is the best way to find the perfect balance for your taste. Start with the standard ratio and adjust as needed.

Remember, the type of coffee and brewing method also affect the taste. **Freshly ground beans** can enhance flavor significantly.

# Types Of Coffee Beans

When brewing the perfect cup of coffee, the type of coffee beans you use plays a crucial role. Understanding the different types of coffee beans can help you decide how many scoops of coffee to use for 10 cups. Two primary types of coffee beans dominate the market: Arabica and Robusta. Each type has unique characteristics that can influence your coffee’s flavor and strength.

# Arabica Vs. Robusta

Arabica and Robusta are the most popular coffee beans worldwide. They differ in several ways, from their growing conditions to their flavor profiles. Here’s a closer look at each:

* **Arabica Beans:**
* Grown at higher altitudes.
* More susceptible to pests and diseases.
* Smooth, mild flavor with a hint of sweetness.
* Lower caffeine content compared to Robusta.
* **Robusta Beans:**
* Grown at lower altitudes.
* More resistant to pests and diseases.
* Strong, bold flavor with a bitter taste.
* Higher caffeine content.

Arabica beans are more delicate and require specific growing conditions. They produce a smoother, more aromatic coffee. Robusta beans are hardier and can be grown in varied conditions. They produce a stronger, more bitter coffee. Depending on your preference for flavor and caffeine content, you might choose Arabica for a milder taste or Robusta for a more intense experience.

# Flavor Profiles

The flavor profiles of coffee beans are influenced by various factors, including their type, origin, and roasting process. Understanding these profiles can help you choose the right beans for your desired taste.

Ever find yourself staring blankly at a screen, knowing you *should* be doing something important but instead, you’re scrolling through memes? 🤦‍♂️ Yeah, me too. Motivation can be a slippery little devil, can’t it? One minute you’re pumped and ready to conquer the world, and the next, you’re drowning in distractions like they’re the new coffee!

So, on those days when motivation dips (we all have them), what can we do? I’ve gathered a few tricks that have helped me get back on track, and hey, maybe they’ll work for you too!

**1. Break it Down**  
Ever heard the phrase “how do you eat an elephant?” Well, not that I’d want to, but the answer is, one bite at a time!  
- **Chunk it Up:** Take your big tasks and slice them into smaller, manageable pieces. It’s like leveling up in a video game—why try to beat the boss in one go when you can level up your way there? 🎮
- **Set Micro-Goals:** Five-minute tasks can work wonders. Start with just five minutes—it's amazing how often you’ll find yourself still going after that!

**2. Change Your Scenery**  
Sometimes, our environment feels stale. When was the last time you *really* changed things up?
- **Get Outside:** Fresh air and a change of scenery can be revitalizing. It’s like hitting the reset button on your brain! 🌳 
- **Redecorate Your Workspace:** Even a small change, like moving your desk around or adding a plant, can spark creativity.

**3. Use the Pomodoro Technique**  
Okay, this one sounds fancy, but it’s super simple!  
- **Set a Timer:** Work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. Rinse and repeat! 🍅  
- **Reward Yourself:** After a few cycles, treat yourself to something nice. It gives you something to look forward to—like dessert after dinner! 

**4. Keep a Distraction List**  
We all have those random thoughts that pop into our heads when we’re trying to focus, right?
- **Jot It Down:** Whenever your mind wanders off on a tangent, write it down. You’ll be surprised how much clearer your head feels without those thoughts nagging at you!
- **Tackle It Later:** You can come back to those distractions later, without them hijacking your current focus time.

**5. Embrace The Power of Music**  
Feeling sluggish? Music can be a miracle worker! 🎶  
- **Create a Focus Playlist:** Find tunes that energize you or help you concentrate. Whether it's lo-fi beats or movie soundtracks, find what feeds your vibe.
- **Nature Sounds:** If you prefer something more serene, try ambient sounds like rain or ocean waves. Perfect for tuning out the chaos!

So, what works for you when your motivation decides to take a rain check? Do you have your own secret weapons for staying focused? Let’s share some strategies and keep each other uplifted! After all, we’re all in this together, right? 🙌✨",1,1744341026.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

His father was on tour with his second album. Absolutely in love with me. We lived across the country from each other. I went to college and just disappeared, he forgot I was going. Didn't have a cellphone and left my landline at home to be able to focus more on studies. We'd talk for hours almost every day about nothing, and he'd come visit every few months before college. I told him to focus on the band while I was looking for employment. My first few months of college were going smoothly it was difficult so I thought the stress was making me sick. When he'd visit we would just go to Broadway and chill, I looked 14 so he was not physically attracted to me so we did it once when really high. We met when I was 23, refused to believe I was not 14. I was doing stage management taking care of the back room behind the ""dressing room"" he came off stage and just yelled it's fucking hot up there, being the drummer he was done before everyone else, came out from the back room. Hey man you need some help cooling off? Hey sorry kid, didn't know you were here. We went in the back room talked a lot. Then after everything he was still curious, we talked more I took him for pizza.(A lot happened I'll make a separate post) I moved to the same county as him for a job, in the good area. Had a baby sitter when I was forced to reconnect with him at a party, my friend ambushed me by not telling me he was there already. I thought he was mad. Nope still wildly in love 14 years later. I couldn't bring myself to tell him yet I just said I have a big life changing surprise. Texted to see if he was going to band practice. Feeling a little sick so maybe. I brought my son. The guys were shook, he looked exactly like his dad did at 16 when they started. Who the fuck is this? This is my son Ashley. Why is this here?? I'm on break from college. Pussy ass bitch. Got a bitch name and spending time with mom instead of partying. Listen you mofos if he wants to spend his break with me, I don't ever stop him from doing anything. He's a good boy, tells me everything. This is his first house party. Damn, Brian you raised a🐈‍⬛. Since the drum kit was empty he asked if he could fill in for the practice. His dad is/was the drummer, left and came back to help uncredited for the last few albums. I knew my son was good. They looked at me I said he's good, but I don't make his decisions or yours. I'm not a part of this. They got 2 songs in and his dad comes back from the bathroom. Wow, you guys replaced me? All eyes on him I've never seen a grown man squeal he's 39 at this point in time. No, No, no. Looks at me tearing up no, no, no. It's like looking at my highschool yearbook. I missed 17 years with my son how could you do that to me?!?! I know I'm sorry I tried to tell you last week but I couldn't, I knew you'd give up on the dream. I couldn't do that to you. Sitting right there is my dream and making all my memories with you. You know we aren't going to work. I don't care you don't believe in marriage. I know it would bug you and you'd resent me for it. We would still spend our lives together so it wouldn't matter. I left over a decade ago anyway, tried to find you, but you moved without telling your family. They said you had a kid while in college, not that it was mine. They didn't know. But you did? Is it mine? Yes, obviously he's yours. How do you know? I hate sex, remember? So what would I do it? Well you did me. You were adorable and very emotional. Was adorable?? It's been a decade and a half, we both aged but yeah less cute more defined and handsome. You finally look 23. I was not able to contact you either sent fan mail with my number incase you had forgotten when I got settled. And heard you left the bad for ""creative differences"". Sorry guys we have to go I have 17 years to catch up on. Wait at least hear him play. Sat back down on the couch while, Ash started a solo play. He graduated at 12. Harvard reached out to us. Full ride scholarship. Then he got another for sports, and music 3 in total. 5.0 GPA. He's doing Astro physics like you wanted to but couldn't. His friends laughed and said damn bro didn't know you were smart.  No, she's smart 2 doctorates before 40. Sweety by 26. No way!! she's more hood than the rest of us. I can be both. You, your loser bastard, hoe are nerdy🐈‍⬛s. And deserve each other. Kris nearly exploded at Vinny's the remark of his son. You ever so much as look at my son and think anything I'll cap you. I quickly got in-between them. Kris if you had any balls you would have made a decision you or us years ago. Look you two cool off, he could have had both I was already home waiting for him to visit or call for years. He didn't lock you down or anything and was just miserable missing and thinking about you. Look nothing would have changed between us. That's bull, he loves you so much. If I had told him I loved him he would have been a lot happier I suppose. Why didn't you? That's none of your business Kris growled. Bitch you wanna go?I know he'd never hurt me, but Vinny hated me. By this point 2 of the other band mates were behind the one friend saying how that was to far, not cool, dick move. and one was behind Kris. You should get a DNA test, remember she's a hoe? Everyone was like bro the fuck is wrong with you? Okay fine I see your boiling point that was a fair comment a little rude so imma let it slide(I turned around and gave him a quick cuddle)whispered ""Dont get hurt it's okay to admit when you can't do something and think about your son""You two go at it he took that several steps to far. I stepped out of the way. Ash go outside now, please. Okay Mom, but dad needs some backup. Great you and the small bastard will get 6foot under by me. Hey fuck you dude, if I wasn't being a better person for my son. I'd take you right now.(I had fought him when we were both younger. Underestimated me I won easily. I stepped away and watched both of them get held back. Kris is rail thin and would have been crushed by Vinny's 250 pounds of muscle. The guys decided that the best way to break it up was separation and smoking. An hour later we just went back to everything like nothing happened. They've been best friends for years and I guess apologied to each other. Kris standing by the drums with his arm out waiting for our son to go over. He looked at me asif to ask for permission. I leaned down said your a decent man now. I think you should fearlessly make your own choices, your dad is also a great man. I want to see you play a bit more. Thank you so much dad! is everyone cool with it? he asked the room. Yeah little dude, you have our respect joining a fight you'd lose to protect family. Vinny huffed and said nothing, I was staring daggers at him. Everyone joked Ash was better like Kris at the start, just fresh. Kris was always the life of the party and funny af seeing him angry again and seeing red was painful. The6of us grew up in hoods. Mine was NYC, you5 are LA. Collective thanks for waiting but also not cool to keep it from him, he's capable of making his own choices. Look I wanted to let him party and have fun, not diapers and unfun sleepless nights. When I heard he left I tried to contact him. I figured he moved on and had his own family. For years we had to hear about you. No proof that was me. How many bitches does he know in medschool?? All of you told him not to fall in love with a hoe and hated me because you thought I was going to keep him. I sent him back to you but he left his heart with me. Yeah you basically killed him. Refused to party or hang out with girls. I was like nope during one of the calls I told him to have sex, and I assumed he was anyways. Baby no, I only did when I'd visit you. Well that's lonely and boring neither of which are you. Well I know you weren't so I felt a little guilty. Yeah that's my son he's really good. He had been playing the whole time. Damn mom, that's why you never talked about him. It was to protect you, I never wanted you to give up on anything. Having you and your mom was my main dream, and a family is just painful to miss out on, I missed you so much over the years. Baby Just in case he hated me, I couldn't do that to you. I wanted you to meet earlier, I just couldn't find him. Tears streamed down dads face. He was a happy child hardly ever cried or anything, even as he aged. We are super close he tells me everything, like everything. That's my boy getting laid. Okay dad, I don't know you well enough to have that conversation especially with other people around. It's okay son, completely natural and normal. Look, Ash is really shy I'm surprised he's talking at all. I whispered in his ear he got scared and left so no he didn't. Okay guys it's time to go and get caught up on the last 17 years. Hun he's 14 just looks like 17. Went to a coffee shop and I wanted to let them get acquainted but they both asked me to stay. He said I'm not mad at you son for being the way you are, I was pretty shy too and just used humor to get in with people, my friends made it easier to talk to the ladies for me. If that's not your thing that is also okay. It feels weird calling you dad as we just met and having a deep conversation not with mom. It's okay call me key, until you are comfortable. I saw you crying earlier are you okay? I spent years missing to you grow up. Dad is great for me to call you. Eyy keywi I know you are excited but he's not ready to open up to you yet. I know I just love him so much. We just met dad, how can you know that? I love her more than anything in the world and you are both of us. Yeah but by your lifestyle I'm a complete disappointment. Shh no you are not. The guys exaggerated most of the lyrics. And I as they said didn't want to party. Yeah but you did before mom. I was making bad choices, to fit in. You are strong enough to not do that, I'm a little jealous of that. Hey keywi can we talk a moment outside? Sure. Look it's okay to be mad at me for not telling you sooner or finding you. I didn't know Cman was still living here either. No honey, I'm just relieved and happy to see you again. Yes, it would have been good to know. You wanted to let me enjoy my partying years I just felt empty without you. I kept reaching out. No one would tell me anything. I'd fly out and stay at your place remembering the good times and looking for anything that might tell me where you were. I'm sorry I didn't know. I didn't call you. My aunt said when I settle in my new place she'd call you. I had a great job, guess she decided that I didn't need to give up either. Everyone ""lost"" your number and when I came back it was no longer on the fridge. Or phone contacts. No voicemails or anything. I heavily debated on letting you know immediately so nobody gave me your number LA is a big place. I couldn't bring Ash with me to search it. You diserved your freedom anyways. That must have been so hard being a single mother. Not really he's a great kid. He always understood why I needed to do everything I did, even as a toddler. Or perhaps just liked the nanny, we always spent the weekend, doing whatever he wanted together. He saw I'd come home exhausted and ready to collapse but would still make dinner for him. He started to do it for us. I got a job offer in LA so here I am. So proud he is smart and in the best college. Me too how did that happen? A lot of hard work. Maybe start a little easier with him. We come back he's looking terrified. Did Mom tell you how boring I am compared to you? No, even if she tried, we are completely different people. I don't think you're boring, I'd like to hear about your life from you. She just told me to chill a little and how proud she is. They talk, I take a business call. Hey guys did you want to go to the party I did promise you your first house party. I want to talk to Dad more. He can teach you to be social and party. If you want you two can spend the night at my place or move in so we can be a family. Ohh mom can we? I never stopped you from making your own decisions. I have to stay at my place for my job. Okay party than Dad's? Fuck yeah. Ash we both love you and I'm off on vacation too. So we can stay as long as you want. It was nice watching him open up and not so uptight and responsible. I brought them both some jungle juice. Smelled it and said smells flammable. Dad shot it immediately after I gave it to him. It's okay to not drink. You don't. I'm mom not you I can't drink. I do have an occasional scorch. Try it before deciding if you like it.(Spit it out Immediately)See you at least tried it. I get more than enough kissing your dad. You seemed sad and alone until lately. Baby I had you I've never been alone. I love you Mom, you have not done PDA yet. Oh baby we didn't want to do anything infront of you until you are comfortable around this stranger. It's okay, I know you are having sex tonight. Maybe not baby we are focusing on you. Might just stay up until we all pass out. Fine I'm happy with you guys go for it. You never held me back I refuse to do it to you. Sweety have fun, let me find where Kris slipped off to. Let me know when you want to go. I'm going in the back to smoke after finding him. If you want to try it, I won't stop you either. The party was banging, it was hard to talk. Dad is wasted and just having fun. The rest of the band was like he hasn't been this happy since before meeting you. Look at him being the life(of the party)again dancing, cracking jokes and getting freaky. We're all to old to be raging so smoke until buzzed and get grinded on for a bit is their party life now. My manz was really have fun like I hoped he was when I made him leave. You'd better make sure he's going home with you when he's like this he used to be unpredictable. He was dancing in the street at this point. If he wants some strange, I'd say he deserves it. Just so you know he had a few girlfriends over the years, none worked out because they couldn't live up to you. That's tragic I always hoped he was happy doing whatever he did. Ash came out shortly after me because it was too loud. If you don't want to smoke this 🪴, that's totally fine Whenever you are ready. Mom this has been great, dad is having a lot of fun. I want to go, but don't want him to hate me for making him, leave. Oh he won't hate you. Stay out here I'll talk to him. He was aggressively affectionate, I swear it felt like when he was first able to be physically attracted to me. We slipped off into an empty room. Showed how much he missed me. Baabe Ash wants to leave, are you done? Party isn't my scene anymore, to old and I have a family to think of now. Well you just tried to grow it. Sorry it's just been forever since we touched. We literally did this 3 days ago, you're drunk, I'm driving. We took his car back to his huge house. I went to my place and grabbed some clothes for us. We stayed a few weeks. Roadtriped across the country to get Ash back to school. I went back to my place and started working again. We'd meet up for dates and started to get more comfortable as a family. Ash opened up to him, not as much as he was to me. I'd like to say happily ever after. He asked me if I remembered when he ""asked me to marry him"". I was like yeah you wanted to practice for your girlfriend. You were my only one, for years. Yeah your friends told me about the others, I was going to tell you but didn't want to fight or bring down the mood infront of Ashley. Babe it's fine I'm happy for you to move on and be happy or just get some. You will never understand how crushed I was when you said no. But then turned around and said do it again. I know I did just wanted you to be prepared in case she said no. You had said yes the second time and if she said no she'd be crazy. Anyone would be lucky to have me. How you wished it might have been us in another life. I was a little suspicious when the second time you picked me up and kissed me spinning me around before putting me down. Yeah, you snacked me and said don't do that to your girlfriend. It's not cheating tho. If you found out I was kissing some other dude a few years ago you'd be pissed give her that respect. When you said that you wished it was you I wanted to tell you that you were my only girlfriend at the time. Dude we weren't dating, just friends hanging out and having fun. Literally the trip before was the first time you let me hit it. I went home bought a ring and planned out how to begin telling you I loved you romantically, not like my little sister type of relationship. I knew when I started you'd pull back and I wasn't ready to lose you. I just wanted to know what it felt like when you said yes. I'm going to lie to you I'm sorry I scared you. See I told you we won't work you are starting to resent me for not wanting to marry you. No it's the same thing we are still spending our lives together. If you won't take my last name, since Ashley is my son can he have it? That's not my decision. You'll have to talk to him and I'll consider changing my surname. I don't like getting legal shit in my life at all. I promise I'll be the best ""husband"" ever. Babe, you can be better than you already are? I never felt the need to do anything more for you that how I was feeling, they say marry your best friend. Babe I know my disability hurts you. You didn't decide to be a sociopath. We've gotten past the fact you can't feel emotions years ago. I'd like to believe when you lie to me about caring, it's true. I want it to be as well. I should get back to the office, see you later? Oh coming over tonight makes *creepy purr or growl you know what I'm talking about.* Sociopaths can't feel emotions, psychology know it's wrong but still do horrible things with no remorse for the high of doing it.

You go above and beyond for that person. Well, that's what she was to me. 3 years we dated, we broke up and yet, I end up texting her, caring for her, wanting to know if she has eaten well, if she has fixed her back or not, if she is happy or not.

It's 4:37 AM, and I'm staring at my phone in the darkness of my bedroom. Tomorrow is her big interview. I should be sleeping, but my mind won't stop racing. Will it go well for her? Is she prepared? Is she nervous?

My fingers hover over the keyboard. After three years together and months apart, some habits are hard to break. I type:

""Hey, just checking in. Nervous about tomorrow? I know the interview is important to you.""

The message shows as read almost immediately. Three dots appear, disappear, then reappear.

""A little nervous, yeah. But I'll be fine.""

It was our ritual to accompany each other to job interviews and wait till the interview finishes, and spend time with each other post that. We'd get coffee afterward, decompress, celebrate the small victory of making it through. So naturally, I offer:

""I would want to accompany you tomorrow if you'd allow me to""

The response takes longer this time. When it comes, it feels like a door closing:

""No, that's okay.""

Something cold settles in my chest. I stare at those words, remembering all the times we'd waited for each other, how it had been our ritual, our way of showing support.

""No problem. Just wanted to offer. You'll do great tomorrow. Let me know if you change your mind.""

I set my phone down and stare at the ceiling. The fan spins slowly above me, its rhythm hypnotic but offering no answers. That old saying echoes in my mind: *There's nothing known as self-respect when someone's your family.*

She had been my family. She still is! I'd gone above and beyond for her, and part of me still wants to. But maybe, she doesn't need me anymore. Maybe she never did, not in the way I needed her.

I scroll through old pictures, old messages. The evidence of three years together is overwhelming. The patterns are clear now: me checking in, me worrying, me waiting. How many times had I asked about her back pain? Her meals? Her happiness?

I'd thought these questions were a lifeline connecting us post break up. This way, our bond would be the same and we'd become friends again in no time. Now I wonder if they were just threads I refused to cut, even as she had started to snip away at her end.

It hits me suddenly: in thinking she needed me, perhaps I was blind to how much I needed her instead. The realization doesn't make the ache any less. A question forms: What would it feel like to not text tomorrow, to not wonder if she's nervous, to not wait? Will she tell me about the interview on her own? Will she miss me?

I place my hand over my heart, feeling its steady rhythm. ""Tomorrow,"" I whisper to the empty room, ""I will not text her about the interview. I will not put myself where I am not wanted.""

The words hurt to say, but they also release something. I've been holding my breath for months, waiting for things to return to what they were. Perhaps it's time to exhale.

I turn off my phone and set it face-down on the nightstand. Tomorrow will come whether I sleep or not, but for the first time in a long time, I feel like I might be ready for it.

Or maybe, it won't. How can I not ask her? for me, she's family right?

My phone screen shows no new messages. For a moment, my fingers itch to type one.

It simply got me thinking, why is it that when you think the other person ""needs"" you, it is you who need them more, and in their eyes, maybe they've simply replaced you or maybe, just moved on.

1jwfygd,https://www.reddit.com/r/fitness30plus/comments/1jwfygd/new_self/,New self,"Whats up everyone,

35M and I have / had a heart condition since birth. Last month I had surgery, am healing up well and the doctors and me are excited for me to feel better and to be healthier than I ever have. I have never been able to specifically exercise my entire life. I also used to smoke cigarettes, weed, and drink hella coffee. I have never been inactive, I go hiking and biking with my kids and we could go all day and it wouldn’t be a big deal. With breaks obviously, but I never saw myself as inactive. Just not very strong, spindly legs, could never seem to build muscle really. 

That’s all changing. I quit smoking in January, have been sober for a month and haven’t had any coffee or caffeine at all. I’m ready for a new self and new life. I’ve been doing cardiovascular therapy to build myself back up, and doing exercises at home within reason because my sternum is still healing. 5lbs each arm, I am at a 10lb restriction until my chest is healed. 

I’m looking for some advice or pointers, where does a person start when they’ve never started before? I will never be able to power lift or do lifts where I hold my breath and strain hard, but can do repetitive things and build stamina, stretches and yoga etc. 

I’ve been holding the weights at arms length out to the side and in front of me, kind of twisting them back and forth while they’re out there, shoulder shrugs with them, and have hand squeezer things. 

My legs though are so weak, I have never been able to run a mile, a half mile, even a couple blocks before my legs are just done. But I can ride a bike for miles no problem. Now that my heart is healing and I will be able to actually do things, where would you start if you had to start over?

1jwfyd3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Finland/comments/1jwfyd3/i_asked_chatgpt_how_finns_survive_the_winter/,I asked ChatGPT how Finns survive the winter….,"
Would you say the answer is accurate?

~~~

“The answer is equal parts practical magic, cultural mindset, and really good wool socks.

Here’s how Finns not only survive, but thrive through the long, dark winters:

⸻

1. Embracing the Darkness (Instead of Fighting It)

Finns don’t try to escape winter — they lean into it. They even have a word for their philosophy:

“Sisu”

It means quiet strength, resilience, and endurance — the Finnish winter mindset in a word.

⸻

2. Light Rituals
	•	Candles everywhere — not just for function, but for mood (think hygge but more minimalist).
	•	Sauna becomes even more central — heat, ritual, and social connection.
	•	Fireplaces are in daily use — the crackling wood, warm glow, and scent = comfort therapy.

⸻

3. Proper Gear: There’s No Bad Weather, Only Bad Clothing
	•	Finns dress smart: layers, wool base layers, high-quality parkas, waterproof boots, and reflectors on coats or bags (it’s very dark).
	•	Thermal underwear is just normal clothing.
	•	Kids are bundled like marshmallows and still play outside daily.

⸻

4. Staying Active
	•	They don’t hibernate. Winter activities are part of life:
	•	Cross-country skiing, ice skating, sledding, snowshoeing
	•	Dipping into frozen lakes after sauna (yes, it’s invigorating)
	•	Walking outside daily, even when it’s -20°C

⸻

5. Food: Hearty and Warm
	•	Root vegetables, soups, casseroles, rye bread, porridge
	•	Winter is time for reindeer stew, creamy salmon soup (lohikeitto), and oven pancakes.
	•	They drink a lot of coffee, sometimes spiked with something warming.

⸻

6. Prioritizing Rest and Slowness
	•	Darkness is not fought — it’s honored with early nights, slow mornings, and naps.
	•	People genuinely rest more in winter, respecting natural rhythms.
	•	Minimalism and coziness go hand in hand — candles, warm blankets, quiet music.

⸻

7. Mental Health Awareness
	•	Finns are very aware of Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD).
	•	Many use bright light therapy lamps in the morning.
	•	And there’s no stigma in acknowledging winter blues — talking about it is totally normal.

⸻

8. Winter Celebrations
	•	Christmas and the weeks leading up to it are magical: fairy lights, markets, glögi (mulled wine), baking.
	•	Midwinter festivals like Laskiainen (sledding + pea soup + buns).
	•	After Christmas, they look forward to the return of light — days start getting longer by late January.

⸻

9. Home is a Sanctuary
	•	Most Finns make their homes calm, clean, and soothing.
	•	Big focus on natural materials, warm lighting, and quiet spaces.
	•	Reading, knitting, baking, and sauna are all home-based winter comforts.

We had a few conversations over coffee, where we shared and exchanged personal details and stories which felt meaningful even if it were still professional (She’s in a leadership position for context.) She has a busy schedule and was always juggling a lot, but she still made time occasionally, which I appreciated more than I probably let on.

Over time, things changed and she became less available and didn’t have time to meet anymore. I didn’t handle that well. I got upset and, looking back, I think I put pressure on her by trying to hang out outside of work. I don’t think she ever directly said anything about it, but I know she has strong personal/work boundaries, and my actions may have crossed them. 

Though she initially apologized for not having room in her schedule, the following day she began pulling away and avoiding me for a few weeks. After a few weeks, I checked in on her and she replied asking me not to contact her again outside of work purposes, and she didn't reply to my follow ups. Not long after that, circumstances changed and I ended up stepping away.

I later tried reaching out one last time through LinkedIn, my only avenue of contacting her outside work, hoping to understand what went wrong and apologize properly, but she blocked me. So now I have no way to get closure, and I’m left carrying the weight of guilt and regret.

I’m not trying to rekindle anything. I just want to learn from this and be forgiven, if not by her, then maybe at least within myself. Has anyone gone through something similar?

I dreaded dealing with a perceived hassle of going to some authorized repair place and not having my coffee maker for weeks. 
I called Breville support yesterday morning at 6 am PST and got through fairly quickly, they had me do a video chat to show them what was wrong and very quickly they agreed to send a replacement. I agreed to the option of having a $400 hold placed on my credit card until my unit was returned so they could ship it immediately. 
The replacement is scheduled to be delivered tomorrow morning by UPS. I just find that really amazing and thought it worthwhile to share such a positive customer service experience. 
I could say that it’s the kind of support one should expect for a $1500 product, but that is certainly not always the case.

We are the only company in India that has built a Vision AI foundational model for identifying people and tracking people. Our inference model was built by a team of 2 people. Our total team size is of 3 people.
Our global competitor Amazon GO charges $200K for setup of such a store while we can do it for just $7500(fraction of what it costs).
Yet we lost because we are based in India and Indian VCs are so scared of funding innovation that we will most likely be forgotten.
Some statements made by VCs when we approached them(we have met with almost all of the VCs in India)
1. VC: Indians dont need such stores, qcommerce hai hamare paas.(we have qcommerce)
Us: But sir, costing dekhiye. We can setup small stores across localities and make them a fulfillment centers for qcommerce companies as well without any manpower while also serving walk-in customers who dont wish to pay extra for the convenience.
2. VC: Get $100k to $200k ARR then we can talk.
They are a seed stage VC and talk about backing early founders.
Also we are building in AI with no outside team how do we scale upto there without any backing?
No one has the answers.
3. VC: Dont go for innovation, yaha pe koi paisa nai dega(no one will give you money for this)
Find some service industry and work in that sector. Just drop this.

Our VC sector is built around funding delivery, gashion or makeup, coffee, drinks, shirts, dashboards based services or AI companies which actually work on Chatgpt.
So yeah sorry to say this but Indian startups will never be innovative due to this.
Unfortunately, once we are completely dead Indian companies will tie up with some foreign company(Amazon GO), pay them 10X and say that we are innovating in India.

Green hydrogen hubs, promoted by the European Clean Hydrogen Alliance, can facilitate decarbonisation of industrial processes and provide a zero‑emission alternative to natural gas . Carbon capture, storage, and utilisation (CCUS) technologies are being piloted under the European Green Deal to reduce emissions from hard‑to‑abate sectors such as steel and cement .

Additionally, the Biden administration recently extended clean energy tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act to include marine energy, nuclear, hydropower, geothermal, and waste‑energy recovery, broadening the scope of eligible transitional energy sources . This builds on the Act’s US $369 billion climate investment, which has driven over US $115 billion in clean energy projects and created more than 90,000 jobs in just two years .


---

2. Scaling Renewable Energy
The European Union is projected to install a record 89 GW of new renewable capacity in 2025—70 GW of solar and 19 GW of wind—crucial for meeting its 2030 climate targets and reducing reliance on imported fossil gas . In the United States, the Inflation Reduction Act has catalysed over US $115 billion in clean energy investments in two years, demonstrating how targeted fiscal incentives can rapidly scale renewables .


---

3. Enhancing Energy Efficiency
The European Green Deal prioritises energy efficiency through updated building codes, retrofit grants, and stricter appliance standards, aiming to cut energy consumption and emissions across the bloc . Likewise, the Inflation Reduction Act offers tax credits for energy‑saving home improvements and rooftop solar installations, lowering barriers for households and small businesses to upgrade their energy performance .


---

4. Sustainable Agriculture & Land Use
Regenerative agriculture—promoted by the FAO’s Sustainable Food and Agriculture framework—uses practices like cover cropping, reduced tillage, and agroforestry to boost soil health, sequester carbon, and improve resilience to climate extremes . The Rainforest Alliance has launched a US $20 million resilience fund to help farmers adopt these practices, targeting certification of 100 million farmers by 2030 and strengthening livelihoods in key commodities like cocoa and coffee .


---

5. Circular Economy & Waste Reduction
The EU Clean Industrial Deal includes a Circular Economy Act to lower feedstock costs, promote recycling, and decouple growth from resource consumption . Corporate extended producer responsibility (EPR) schemes—where manufacturers fund and manage product end‑of‑life—are also scaling globally, reducing plastic and packaging waste while spurring design innovations for reuse and recyclability .


---

6. Policy & Financial Instruments
The EU’s Just Transition Mechanism will mobilise at least €100 billion by 2027 to support workers and communities in fossil‑dependent regions, ensuring a socially inclusive shift to a low‑carbon economy . Meanwhile, the EU Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities and the InvestEU programme are directing public and private capital toward projects aligned with net‑zero objectives, with InvestEU’s Sustainability Guarantee de‑risking green investments through EU budget-backed guarantees .


---

7. Community‑Level & Social Initiatives
The Gila River Indian Community has pioneered “solar canal” projects—installing photovoltaic panels over irrigation canals to generate clean power and reduce water evaporation—backed by US $5.65 million in IRA funding . Similarly, Invenergy’s Reactivate program, launched under the IRA, has deployed community solar installations that lower participating families’ electricity bills by at least 20 percent .


---

8. Supporting Eco‑friendly Technologies & Innovation
The IRA’s clean hydrogen production tax credits are spurring development of green hydrogen hubs for heavy‑industry and transport decarbonisation . Public‑private partnerships like the European Clean Hydrogen Alliance—established under the EU Strategy for Energy System Integration—are also mobilising investments in grid‑scale storage and digitalised smart‑grid solutions to integrate variable renewables and bolster system resilience .


---

By combining these transitional solutions—spanning energy, agriculture, industry, and finance—we can “buy time” to curb environmental damage now, while laying the groundwork for the permanent, systemic changes needed to achieve deep decarbonisation and sustainable development.

1jwfmby,https://www.reddit.com/r/indianstartups/comments/1jwfmby/harsh_truth_about_innovation_in_india_by_an_ai/,Harsh truth about innovation in India by an AI Founder,"Hi, I am a Co-Founder of an Indian Startup which is working on building autonomous stores using Vision AI and Sensor Fusion for 24x7 retail.
We are the only company in India that has built a Vision AI foundational model for identifying people and tracking people. Our inference model was built by a team of 2 people. Our total team size is of 3 people.
Our global competitor Amazon GO charges $200K for setup of such a store while we can do it for just $7500(fraction of what it costs).
Yet we lost because we are based in India and Indian VCs are so scared of funding innovation that we will most likely be forgotten.
Some statements made by VCs when we approached them(we have met with almost all of the VCs in India)
1. VC: Indians dont need such stores, qcommerce hai hamare paas.(we have qcommerce)
Us: But sir, costing dekhiye. We can setup small stores across localities and make them a fulfillment centers for qcommerce companies as well without any manpower while also serving walk-in customers who dont wish to pay extra for the convenience.
2. VC: Get $100k to $200k ARR then we can talk.
They are a seed stage VC and talk about backing early founders.
Also we are building in AI with no outside team how do we scale upto there without any backing?
No one has the answers.
3. VC: Dont go for innovation, yaha pe koi paisa nai dega(no one will give you money for this)
Find some service industry and work in that sector. Just drop this.

Our VC sector is built around funding coffee, drinks, shirts, dashboars based services or AI companies which actually work on Chatgpt.
So yeah sorry to say this but Indian startups will never be innovative due to this.
Unfortunately, once we are completely dead Indian companies will tie up with some foreign company(Amazon GO), pay them 10X and say that we are innovating in India.

My company name in case you want to search : Jiffi.

I've tried to research how to do this, but I haven't found anything helpful. So what I'm trying to do just for now is input a string parameter into the website, run it through one of the methods in the classes and return it on the webpage, just for now at least. So how would I do this? 

See code below:

1jwfliy,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_txt6789/comments/1jwfliy/need_help_should_i_report_my_teacher/,Need help should I report my teacher?,"So today I wrote a math test on polynomials, more specifically factoring and the test had standard of excellence questions which made it 10x harder than our quiz we did a week before. We started writing and the first part was pretty simple it had a couple of questions on multiplying polynomials and a word problem about if someone made a mistake in their solution. Then we come to the factoring part we had 8 questions just straight up factoring and then we had a word problem with surface area and one with one where we had to list all the possible factors for 3 different equations for example find all the factors for a which is an interger (3x + ax + 18) I'm not sure if this one is factorable I made it up just now. Then we move onto our last question the one worth the most marks 6. It was very stupid like calculating the volume of Bob's coffee mug if the dimensions were .... so I noticed a lot of people may have skipped questions and gone to this one. So we were all struggling and then with 15 min left of class my teacher goes to the front and was like actually this is not factorable well it is but you get a very ugly number one that you would get in uni math so he then changes all the numbers in the questions with 7 min left! he then tells us there is 5 min left half of the class is begging for more time because we had to restart but he wouldn't so he took our tests. In the afternoon, I went to complain and say it was unfair that you changed the question with so little time left and said how it was also unfair that you would not give us more time. I also said if people spent 20 min before on that question and got exhausted and frustrated, its not fair that you change it and make it so everyone gets all nervous and stressed with 7 min left. He stated ""I will not remove it or excluded it because the change made the question easier""!

do you think this is fair and if not what should I do?

I've had 2 milk disasters in my car: A fresh milk boba exploded everywhere one time and the other was when my son somehow spilled a travel mug of already curdled milky coffee.

And I'm happy to report that the car smells just fine now.

Here's what we did, after a bunch of research:

1- Soak up as much milk as you can with a towel or whatever.
2 - Spray enzyme cleaner over the whole thing.
3 - Spread a pretty thick layer of baking soda over everything and leave for a day.
4 -Vacuum up the baking soda and start the process over from step 2
5 - repeat as many cycles as necessary, but for us we went through about 4 cycles of this before the smell was totally gone.

I was bringing it over to the coffee table it was very hot and our toddler’s toys were all over the table so I accidentally set it down on a toy and it spilled. It wasn’t such a big deal but he quickly said he could save it and then when he realized he couldn’t he started cleaning it up. I kinda just watched bc it was whatever and I would have just like scooped it up off the table w a pita chip and ate it if it was up to me. He then loudly goes “so are you gonna help me clean it up or not!?” I was like no..? it’s not a big mess, anyway that really pissed him off and he stopped cleaning it and took the baby and stormed upstairs while telling me how pathetic I was and that i could clean it up myself then. 

This also normally happens when he’s putting the dishes away after dinner and i’m sitting on the couch, even tho i made the dinner. He’ll be like “if you’re just gonna sit there go upstairs I don’t wanna see you sitting there while i’m cleaning up”. 

So AITA for not helping my husband clean up and relaxing instead? Any ideas on how to resolve this moving forward? Like the mess will get cleaned up eventually I just don’t wanna do it exactly when he wants it done. ",9,1744338697.0,AmItheAsshole,41,0.71,False

Arrived to the house to find her mom on the floor between the couch and coffee table. Sitting up leaning heavily to the left. Slurred speech, unable to lift left arm or squeeze left hand, no movement at all on that side, left sided facial droop. Only sporadically following commands. Last time daughter is sure she was fine was yesterday morning during the phone call. Pt just got out of the hospital 2 days ago for pneumonia. 

So BP 140/95, P 72, R 22, BGL 105, SpO2 96 room air. 

Primary stroke center 20 minutes away (can give thrombolytics)
Stroke center capable of thrombectomy 1.5hours away or 45min to one hour if I call life flight. 

So my question is would it have been better to get her flown to the higher level of care since it was to late for the tPA?
Or is getting her to the CT scan faster worth going to the primary stroke center?

1jwfdpi,https://www.reddit.com/r/RawVegan/comments/1jwfdpi/blood_test_revealed_low_potassium_anemia_and_low/,"Blood test revealed low potassium, anemia and low heart rate","Hi all! I have tried off and on to do a raw vegan primarily fruitarian diet and cant hang on for long. Honestly I am really frustrated and confused what I’m doing wrong. I eat a variety of fruit mostly bananas, pineapple, orange and orange juice, and mixed berries. 3-4 days a week I’ll have something like a sweet potato or chickpeas for dinner. Also, I have been self administering intramuscular b12 injections monthly for about 1.5 years now. I keep my sodium under 200mg usually because I don’t see the logic in eating rocks. I was highly encouraged to get a blood test done which revealed low potassium and anemia to my surprise. Also, lately my heart rate is trash when I’m training on my road bike (bad for me is something like 105-120bpm when 138-155 would actually be normal).

I love the way I feel eating this way but I feel deficient so in desperation I’ll eat at the cafeteria where I work and eat a salty meal with some kind of meat, usually red meat like beef, which almost immediately remediates my poor heart rate and I just feel more energetic. 

I sweat a lot, run about 18-24 miles a week on average and roughly 200 miles a week on my road bike and I’m very conscious of how my body is doing. I drink one cup of coffee a day. I would say I feel a little unhealthy at the moment due to these factors but seem to do well for a few days after introducing some meat which I would really rather not be doing from an ethical and health standpoint. I’m assuming that I have iron deficient anemia and the low potassium is tied to low sodium since those two electrolytes keep each other balanced. The heart rate thing seems very tied into this as well.

I’m really frustrated and need some advice from people in this community. I don’t feel like I can ask for advice from my peers or other athletes because I know they would say to eat more meat and more sodium, but I feel like there’s got to be a better way more aligned with non cruelty and a more natural way of eating. ANY advice is greatly welcomed.",3,1744338399.0,RawVegan,6,0.8,False

Recently I've decided to go through and listen to various classic pop-punk albums artist by artist. I decided to start with FTSK as they only have three studio albums, so I figured they'd be pretty manageable. I've heard a few songs from their self-titled and J.A.C.K., and thought they were pretty good, so I have high hopes for this album. My review is below:

1. Woah Oh (Me Vs. Everyone) - 5/10. A weak opener, but not terrible by any means

2. Hey Brittany - 7/10. A massive improvement from the last song. Starts strong and ends strong, but that atrocious fucking bridge means I can't rank this higher than a 7. I don't mind heavy autotune (I love Future), but the way it's used here is annoying and hard to listen to.

3. My Worst Nightmare - 2/10. Jesus Christ, what the hell did I just listen to? This was one of the most painful songs of all time. It sounded like if Etienne Sin didn't say the n-word.  This is like Hot Chelle Rae, but missing what makes their music good, and what makes it work.

4. Believe Me, I'm Lying - 8/10. Actually a really enjoyable song. The aggressive autotune actually worked here, and improved the track. Good, but not great. Hopefully the last song was the low point of this album.

5. The Way She Moves - 9/10. A genuinely great song. I've noticed that FTSK always has really strong choruses, even if their verses tend to fall flat. But this one was all around really good. These songs keep getting better and better!

6. She's A Lady - 6.5/10 - pretty okay, I guess. Definitely the easiest song on this record to consume. I can understand why this was the big single from the album.

7. Uh Huh - 3/10. Dammit, I really thought this album was improving, and then this song came on. It had a catchy hook, but that's all the good it offers. This is shaping up to be a very hit or miss album.

8. Phone Call - 4/10. Damn, two misses in a row. This wasn't abysmal, I quite liked the chorus once again, but everything else about this song is just pathetic. This final stretch better be good.

9. Breakdown - 2.5/10. Wow… that was really bad. At this point, not even the good hooks can save these songs from being so unbelievably bad.

10. That For Me - 10/10. This was a REALLY good song. I loved every second of this. The chorus was as good as always, the verses were solid, and the acoustic guitars were finally mixed well. Of course, that probably means the next song will be a 0.

11. Coffee Break - 10/10. Well shit, that was amazing… I honestly have no notes. This song was beautiful and I have no words to describe it

12. Catastrophe - 5.5/10. *Honk shoo, mimimimimimimi… Honk shoo, mimimimimimimi…*

Overall rating: 5/10

Favorites: Coffee Break, That For Me, and The Way She Moves

Least favorites: My Worst Nightmare, Uh Huh, and Breakdown

Final thoughts: While this album had some highlights, I didn't enjoy listening to it. There are only 4 songs on here I'd ever revisit, and my bottom 5 for this album are all atrocious. Hopefully their next two albums are an improvement.",3,1744338351.0,poppunkers,2,1.0,False

1jwfcd7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jwfcd7,"[Megapost] The Humanoid Revolution Is Here: 2025’s Top 8 Robots Ranked by Power, Speed, Intelligence, and Market Readiness","It’s 2025, and the future looks like… us.
Humanoid robots have finally stepped out of science fiction and into our factories, warehouses, and—soon—our homes.

We’re not talking about concept art or lab-only demos. These are full-on, production-ready machines walking, running, flipping, and (in some cases) making your coffee. Each of these bots represents years of engineering, billions in investment, and a new race: not just for robotic supremacy, but for the future of work, home life, and automation itself.

Let’s break down the leaders in this high-stakes humanoid arms race and see how they compare across speed, strength, dexterity, intelligence, and commercial viability. Spoiler: this ain’t just a Boston Dynamics flex-fest anymore.

⸻

1. Boston Dynamics Atlas – The Apex Predator

Boston Dynamics just dropped the fully electric version of Atlas, and it’s an absolute beast. No more hydraulics—just smooth, humanlike movement powered by reinforcement learning and Nvidia Jetson Thor AI chips. It’s doing backflips, cartwheels, sorting car parts, and basically showing off.

	•	Height/Weight: 5’8”, 165 lbs
	•	Key Strength: Unreal agility + industrial utility
	•	Use Case: Car part sequencing at Hyundai factories
	•	Bottom Line: Still the most technically impressive humanoid on Earth. Period.

⸻

2. Tesla Optimus Gen 3 – The Mass Production King

Elon’s not just bluffing. Optimus is rolling off production lines, and Tesla plans to ship 5,000–12,000 units this year, with 50k in 2026. The latest version is lightweight, smart, and features 22 degrees of freedom in its hands, making it surprisingly dexterous.

	•	Height/Weight: 5’11”, 103 lbs
	•	Key Strength: Scale + Tesla’s AI infrastructure
	•	Use Case: Factory automation (for now)
	•	Bottom Line: Not the flashiest, but probably the most available humanoid in 2025.

⸻

3. Unitree H1 – The Track Star

China’s Unitree H1 holds the world record for fastest humanoid at over 3.3 m/s (possibly up to 4.3 m/s). It flips, sprints, and ships to customers in 6–8 weeks. If you want a robot that runs like an athlete and ships like an Amazon order—this is it.

	•	Height/Weight: 5’11”, 104 lbs
	•	Key Strength: Speed + availability
	•	Use Case: R&D, commercial testing
	•	Bottom Line: It’s fast, nimble, and you can actually buy one.

⸻

4. Sanctuary AI Phoenix – The Dexterity God

Phoenix may not be flipping off walls, but its robotic hands rival human dexterity with 20 degrees of freedom and actual touch sensitivity. Controlled by the Carbon™ AI system, it can translate normal speech into complex physical actions.

	•	Height/Weight: 5’7”, 155 lbs
	•	Key Strength: Haptic hands + language AI
	•	Use Case: Precision tasks, research
	•	Bottom Line: If hands win the future, Phoenix is already there.

⸻

5. Apptronik Apollo – The Factory Workhorse

Backed by a $350M round led by Google, Apollo isn’t trying to do backflips—it’s designed to do work. It’s being mass-produced by Jabil and deployed in logistics, kitting, inspection, and delivery.

	•	Height/Weight: 5’8”, 160 lbs
	•	Key Strength: Mass production-ready + commercial partnerships
	•	Use Case: Logistics and light manufacturing
	•	Bottom Line: Not flashy, but efficient. The Toyota Camry of humanoids.

⸻

6. Agility Robotics Digit – The Warehouse Specialist

Digit is the first humanoid actually being trialed in U.S. warehouses right now. It has solid battery life, auto-docking, and plays nice with wheeled AMRs. If you’re an Amazon-type operation, this is your guy.

	•	Height/Weight: 5’8”, 143 lbs
	•	Key Strength: Real-world trials + AMR collaboration
	•	Use Case: Warehousing and logistics
	•	Bottom Line: The first humanoid earning a paycheck.

⸻

7. Figure O2 – The AI Whisperer

Partnered with OpenAI, the Figure O2 takes verbal commands and performs tasks on the fly. It’s sleek, redesigned for production, and set to begin alpha home testing in late 2025 with its in-house Helix VLA model.

	•	Height/Weight: 5’6”, 154 lbs
	•	Key Strength: Real-time speech interaction
	•	Use Case: Soon… home and commercial
	•	Bottom Line: AI brain? Check. Muscles? Still developing.

⸻

8. 1X Neo Gamma – The Homebody

Norway’s 1X is playing the long game—building a friendly, lightweight humanoid for domestic use. Neo Gamma isn’t tossing car parts; it’s making coffee, folding laundry, and looking harmless enough to not freak out grandma.

	•	Height/Weight: 5’6”, 66 lbs
	•	Key Strength: Safety + aesthetic + OpenAI backing
	•	Use Case: Home assistant
	•	Bottom Line: A bold bet on humanoids in your living room. Just don’t trip over it.

⸻

Key Takeaways: Where We’re Headed Next

	•	Tesla is winning on volume.
	•	Boston Dynamics is winning on tech.
	•	Unitree is already shipping.
	•	Sanctuary and Figure are bringing the brains.
	•	Apollo and Digit are the blue-collar bots.
	•	Neo Gamma wants to be your roommate.

By the end of 2025, we could see tens of thousands of humanoids in operation—some hauling boxes, some opening doors, and others just quietly vacuuming your floors.

The humanoid revolution isn’t coming. It’s here.

Would you buy a humanoid robot for your home?
Do you trust Elon to build your butler?
Will humanoids replace workers—or become our coworkers?

Let’s talk below.

1jwfau3,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1jwfau3/update_i_found_something_i_shouldnt_have_part_4/,[UPDATE] I found something I shouldn't have... (Part 4 FINALE),"I didn’t know if I was going to post after the past few days. But everything was already typed up and saved I just… sat on it I guess. But now I’ve decided I don’t care. Whatever happens to me happens. After I posted part three, some oddities happened on my account. I’m not going to dive into theories I’m just going to state the facts. I posted. Next morning, posts were still saying pending although they had comments and upvotes. Then they were all taken down as well as everything in my profile. I tried refreshing pages, rebooting routers, but nothing worked. Few hours later everything was back to normal after I called Jack and he did some backend computer work I couldn’t begin to comprehend or explain. For the story thus far, I’d normally post a link in the beginning of this to each part, but I’m gonna ask you to just go to my profile. The other parts are all there. For those already caught up, continue reading.



It’s like someone knew I was onto something and tried to wipe it, but failed. Then it happened. I got a call from Jacks mom. Not too weird but definitely out of the ordinary. She was panicked I could tell immediately. Asking if I heard from Jack. I hadn’t since the day before when he fixed my account. She went to his apartment this morning and his car was in the driveway but no sign of him. I told her I’d try to call then get back to her. The phone rang but immediately went to voicemail. I called back his mom and told her. She was going to the police. I tried to talk her out of it saying I’d try looking first some more. Thank god I couldn’t. I agreed to meet her at the station. Mother’s intuition is a crazy thing sometimes.



She was arguing with the officer who was clearly a kid fresh out of the academy who was just trying to follow procedure. He politely and professionally told us we can’t file a missing persons report for 48 hours. Jack’s mom wasn’t hearing it, and shortly thereafter, a detective overhead and came over looking more like he was trying to save the front desk officer than have genuine interest in our case. He sat us both down and asked what happened. We told him what we know, gave him Jack’s information, and he started to dial his phone right at his desk. “Sure you wrote down the right number, kid?” He asked me.



I looked confused. It was the right number for sure. “Says the number is no longer in service.” He added. “That’s impossible. It went to his voicemail recording this morning.” I replied. The detective looked at me slightly puzzled, wrote something down, then said he’d be in touch. He shook our hands and gave us his card in case there were updates. I told Jack’s mom I’d continue to do what I could and we went our separate ways. My head was spinning. This all had to be tied together, right? Something was telling me that whatever was going on with Jack was someone’s (or something’s) revenge for finding what we did. I went home and poured back over the rest of the journal I had already scoured. Here it is for you guys to see:

February 20th, 2025



Dive day. The plan this morning is to go meet with Captain, then get all our equipment and monitoring devices set up and checked before we do final checks with the divers. I also forgot to mention the divers. Because they have to basically free-dive at that depth, they’re in a saturation chamber to acclimate their bodies to the pressure at depth. Normally for commercial sat divers, they need weeks of living in a pressurized chamber. But the Navy brought over some special saturation chamber they had on the aircraft carrier. That mixed with a newly developed intravenous cocktail, they only needed 24 hours in the chamber before going to the dive bell. Its going to be difficult to run final checks since they go directly from the chamber to the dive bell. But if I’ve seen anything in my time on board this ship its that everyone is oddly prepared. and by “everyone” I mostly mean the Navy. Having contingencies or plans in place like they had trained for this. 



The dive is scheduled for 0357UTC (11:57pm EST for reference). From what I’m told, conditions are ideal topside, both weather and currents included. I got to see the monitoring station where I’ll be during the dive. It is the newest and most high tech equipment. Looked fresh out of the box. I have a team of five people under me. James was my number two and we had three additional techs from MaritimeX. I’d be overseeing the dive in its entirety, monitoring the live footage from the diver helmets on a set of computer monitors. Id also have a headset with a direct line to the divers. No delays or interference at all. Or so I’m promised. Some sort of military tech. Obviously this being a military-involved operation, all the civilians were made to sine nondisclosure agreements. I didn’t know if i fell in the “civilian” or “military” category, so this journal is sort of a legal gray area. I like to tell myself that at least.

February 21st, 2025



My god. It was terrible. So terrible. Theres so much to tell I don’t know where to begin. My heart is pounding and my brain is racking itself trying to find some logical explanation for all of this. I’ll start from the morning of the dive. James and I ran through the plan once again with the team in the monitoring station. The techs ran us through a quick demo of how to use the basic parts of the dive cameras. I had a set of four screens in front of me. Three showing the helmet and body camera footage from each diver, and the fourth was from a submersible ROV unit that I was able to freely control. The techs set it up so it was operated with a video game style controller. Easy enough for anyone to use with some basic pointers. James had the same setup.



The divers exited their chambers into the dive bells. The adorned their suits. These weren’t the big astronaut looking ones you normally see in saturation divers that were hooked to the bell by a lifeline (a series of intertwined cables feeding air, hot water, and other important necessities straight to the diver suit). They still had helmets encapsulating their whole head, smaller, and atop sat a series of lenses and goggles that could be dropped down and interchanged. The suits were sleek, but clearly reinforced. Sort of like Iron Man, but less flashy and more subtle. A worker came over to each diver and used a power drill to secure the bolts of the helmets to the suits at the neck area. Then again but this time around the wrists and ankles where the gloves and boots met the rest of the body. We could see them through a glass wall that separated us from the airlock where the chamber met the bell. The divers gave a thumbs up to the worker, then each other.



On the wall near them were three assault-rifle style looking objects. Each diver picked one up and sighted it down and checked around on some features I couldn’t make out. They weren’t normal guns. But definitely a gun. Some sort of advanced infantry-style weaponry. I noticed their dive knives were located in sheaths on their shoulders. Thats a more tactical placement. Divers in my experience keep them somewhere on the thigh. The more and more I stared, the divers appeared to have combat features on their suits. They looked at us and tested communications. Before I could ask what the guns were, Captain Downes came over my shoulder and pressed the comms button. “Loud and clear.” He said into the headset microphone I was wearing. He and the divers exchanged another thumbs up then they disappeared, one by one into the diving bell.



“Weapons?” I looked up and asked Downes. “It was need-to-know at the time. Had to get you here no matter what.” He replied, looking almost apologetic. “Its alright.” I replied. And I was genuine, it was more so the confusion of why need weapons on a dive? I’d never heard of that. “But why?” I added. Captain Downes stood up and signaled me over to a corner of the room, away from James and the other techs. “I know you saw the shadows in those videos. I saw it in your eyes. It was the same look I had the first time I saw one. We have every reason to believe whatever these “openings” are down there, they’re letting something in. Humanoid, shadow like creatures. They don’t move normally, they can fly freely through the water as if it isn’t there, teleport from one location to the next, its unlike anything we’ve ever seen.” He was talking hurriedly, what seemed like a mixture of fear and excitement, but most of all uncertainty. 



“We’ve only got one recorded interaction, and it was brief. Caught on a stationary dive cam down in the site. One of our floodlights had broken just as one of those shadows was next to it. Although we caught it in a frame-by-frame analysis, the thing totally dissipated briefly, then reformed once the electric burst from the lightbulb was extinguished. The weapons they have are precautionary. Military has contingency for everything. The guns fire high frequency, targeted electromagnetic waves inside an artificial air pocket that will burst upon contact with target. Tested thoroughly, and is all but ready for widespread military use. If all goes well, you’ll hear about it in the news within the coming months. This was all so much. But I was relieved in a sense. I’m glad I wasn’t crazy in seeing those shadow-things. Even more glad I wasn’t the one to have to bring it up.



The dive bell was hoisted off the deck of the ship by a large hydraulic crane. It was suspended over the water, then it dropped, maintaining a thick rope of intertwined wires and tubing that were kept together with a transparent nylon material. The dive bell was connected to the ship, sharing its air and heating regulation systems, as well as direct communication lines to the vessel. It took about four hours to reach the site. Once it arrived, the bell stopped descending and sat hovering over the sunken cul-de-sac. Another equipment and communications checklist run-through for both the dive team and us, and then the hatch at the bottom of the bell opened. 



A cage descended with three walls jutting out from the center, and each diver was standing in their own tight section of it. Inside the bell stayed one technician diver who maintained the systems inside and kept in contact with the surface. A latch opened on the cage and each diver stepped out. What looked liked air hissed out from the tops of the dive suit’s backpacks, and all three divers were swiftly propelled downward, slowing once their boots reached the ocean floor. Their boots lit up at the soles, almost looking like they had magnetized to the surface. The nerd in me was going crazy over getting to see all this new technology the military doesn’t tell us about. But part of me also knew that if they were willing to take the risk of civilians being exposed to it, whatever is going on here is serious, and maybe out of military control.



The divers fanned out like a tactical unit, sweeping their immediate surroundings with the flashlights mounted on their guns, as well as the ones protruding from their suits. I watched through each divers live feed. It was in first person and I was so engrossed in the screen it was eerily feeling like I was down there with them. I was happy I wasn’t. They went into the first house. Furniture floated around lifelessly. Some light creeped in through broken windows coming from the floodlights we had set up around the perimeter of the site. Nothing substantial enough to warrant unaided visibility though. 



Ray’s camera view looked down as he removed a device from his belt. It was some sort of device giving off electromagnetic radiation readings, with a bar of color going from green on the left, then transitioning to yellow, then red on the right. A needle danced in the center of the green area. Ray pointed it around some more, stopping on one direction where the needle spiked briefly. He looked up and over, waving his hand in the direction the device was pointing. The Dan and Jen nodded, and the three stacked up in a line, walking forward toward a set of stairs. Slowly and methodically, they moved up the stairs, each step seeming to lock in place from their boots. But they moved with ease.



Dan was the first at the top of the stairs. He looked to his left, then right. A small hallway on either side, one section led to the open ocean through a decimating hole in the roof. The other side had a room with no door. The team moved in, clearing it quickly. A crib floated pushing up on the ceiling, and stuffed animals with frayed or missing appendages floated in a corner by a small bookshelf adorned with colorful children’s books. Ray looked back down at the device. “The needle still resided in the green zone. “Clear.” His voice echoed in the headset in my ear. The team then free swam out of the house via the hole in the roof and then over to another semi-standing house’s rooftop. Something beeped and then Ray’s camera showed the device again, with the needle in the center of the spectrum now, locked in place in the yellow. “Entering.” Jen said. They swam through a broken window that they were able to pull the frame out of. When they were inside, their boots locked back into the floor. They swept each room. Two bedrooms and a bathroom. All so out of place this deep underwater. The place was furnished, but it was allegedly a test site? It looked lived in. But then why the mannequins? I had more questions than answers. 



Before I could think of another All three dive cameras lit up bright white. After a second or two, they dimmed, and all of them were fixated on what was in front of them of them. They were getting ready to go down to the first floor of the house when at the bottom of the stairs, a glowing purple slit appeared in front of them, surrounded by pulsating grayish-black stone like objects, lit up by the back glow of this opening. Before anyone could say anything a shadow whipped out of the portal and then it closed. The room was dark again. Still. Like it should be 15,000 feet underwater. Only right now, it shouldn’t have been. 



“CLEAR TO ENGAGE!” Captain Downes grabbed the headset off me and yelled into the microphone piece. Before I could talk to him he ran over to the satellite phone hooked on the wall. I watched as the divers’ views all went in different directions, the shadow figure dancing between the monitors my eyes were locked on. A flurry of bright shots emanated from their weapons, and one seemed to make contact. Everyone immediately grabbed their heads. A shriek so loud it felt like my brain was being violently shaken screamed in my skull. I imagine the same thing for everyone happened as we all briefly convulsed in agony. 



I looked back at the dive cameras. The creature began to dissipate, but then through Jen’s camera, I could see it wrapping itself around Dan. He was unable to move. Locked in place. I could see his face and his eyes went black. His veins glowed in his face and down his neck. His mouth began to open as if to say something, and then, the creature stretched out an elongated arm and simply tapped the glass on the face of Dan’s helmet. The creature disappeared and in the same second, I saw Dan return to his body. The real dan. He looked shaken. Then immediately panicked. Before I could realize, a huge crack in the glass formed covering his face. And then… it was like a red mist just kind of spilled out when the pressure caved it in. I looked away. 



“DIVE TEAM RETURN TO BELL NOW!” The diver in the bell screamed over the shared communications line. The lights in the room shut and were replaced with a glowing red one. Over the PA system an automated voice said all too calmly: “This is a lockdown. Remain in your stations. This is a lockdown. Remain in your stations.” Then it stopped sounding. My gaze fixed back to the divers. It would take them about a half hour to get back to the dive bell and they knew they didn’t have time to spare. I could feel the ship began to move. Within ten minutes it was shaking violently. I could see through a window that a violent lightning storm had seemingly come from nowhere. Thunder clapped and rain poured shortly thereafter. I waited as the divers were still a little bit aways from the safety of the bell. Although as each minute passed, the dive bell became less safe. The ship 15,000 feet above it, connected by a long run of wire, violently being tossed around ten to twenty foot waves. 



Static began to crackle in and out of all the screens in the room. The techs assured me it wasn’t the machines, but rather “outside interference.” That was the term they used. The monitors came back on after awhile and I could see that Jen and Ray’s dive cameras were looking up at the bell, getting closer and closer to being right below it. Again, a bright light filled their screens, as well as the submersibles. I had been following them loosely on their way back seeing as the ROV couldn’t fit into any of the structures.



The monitors focused again and Ray and Jen looked at the seabed around them. Those purple tears were popping up left and right, shadowy humanoids, some crawling, others dashing their way out of these openings. There was more darkness than there was light. The only thing I could see was Jen’s camera looking up at the dive bell. Shadows danced around the cable atop it, as it floated in the surrounding ocean. Then one of the things passed through the wire, leaving a glowing purple line sizzling through the circumference of the cable. Then another. And another. The glow subsided, and the cables simply just… separated. The bell began to slowly sink down before landing a few hundred feet in front of the divers. Jen’s camera looked over to Ray, and a shadow disappeared as it flew into him. Like Dan, his eyes went black and his veins glowed. Then, all the computers in the room shut. Static then off inna instant.



The room was quiet. “All crew on deck. All crew on deck.” Came over the PA system in the same, stoic voice. I checked my watch. 1239UTC. Sunset exactly. I guess the situation warranted no more curfew. The deck was loud and windy, still pouring rain. Captain Downes stood out there, waiting for us all to file out. He had a tablet in front of him. “RAMIREZ, HANSON, JACKSON, DAVIS, WILLIAMS, TYLERS, WATKINS, AND JONES. FOLLOW ME!” He yelled over the gusting wind and rain. There were a lot of armed soldiers on board now. Once Downes walked them out past the main deck, James being one of them, down toward the port side and out of our sightline, the guards lined up in front of us, forming a sort of blockade. “YOU MAY RETURN TO YOUR QUARTERS.” One barked at the few of us left.

We were individually escorted back to our rooms and then a guard shut the door behind me. I assumed he was still standing outside. On the way to me room though I saw something. Glancing out a window on the port side, I caught a glimpse of Captain Downes, arm extended toward something out of my view. Then a flash. Followed by him stepping to the side with another flash following. Like he was moving down a line. Were those names of people he read a kill list? I don’t know. I’m going to lay down but I’m sure as hell I won’t sleep.

February 22nd, 2025



My dreams were haunted by shadows. Figures I felt like I knew but couldn’t see. They all watched me. Staring. Studying. i woke up in a cold sweat. We were all woken up at the crack of dawn and the entire crew was in the dining area. Nobody mentioned on Captain’s list was there. The weather had calmed and I could hear a helicopter whirring overhead. It sounded close and then I could hear an engine powering down. Within minutes the General who had given us our initial briefing walked in, followed by Captain Downes. Nobody stood up. “You are all here because you can be trusted. The situation that unfolded here is to be referred to as a research study that yielded no results. No more details are to be given. To anyone. Ever.” He said firmly. “You will all be compensated generously for your assistance in this endeavor. As of this moment, this vessel as well as all equipment on it is property of the United States military. Go back to your quarters. Those of you with held equipment will find it returned upon your arrival. You have 1 hour to gather yourselves and report to the helicopter on deck.”



Nobody had time to raise their hand before they both exited the room. On the way back to my quarters, I took a detour outside. I examined the lower deck of the port side. Where I saw Captain last night. A guard was strolling a post up and down the length of the side. I crouched behind a container and moved quickly across the way to the railing of the ship, covered by a staircase. I traced the railing down as far as I could, but found nothing. While turning back around I heard a small clank at my foot. I moved my shoe aside and found a 9mm shell casing. I looked down the length of the deck and behind me and found two more that rolled up against the bottom of the staircase. That was enough to confirm my theory. The curfew. The list. That was the time they executed those who they didn’t think would be able to keep this under wraps. Innocent people who were here a week ago on their own. Researchers. Genuine researchers. Studying the world. Not whatever the hell they got dragged into.



I returned to my room, sat for a few minutes, planning my next move. I’m going to return to the monitor station, take the hard drive loaded with movies and shows to pass time, wipe it, then download a copy of the ships data. Theres a main system I was given access to that nobody else on my team was. It stored everything in one place, so I could download from there. After that I’d make a move for one of the life vessels that could be piloted hanging off the side of the deck. Wherever that helicopter was going was not somewhere I wanted to be. I’ll figure the rest out when I get back to land. 



………



Same day but last entry. I’m in the lifeboat now. Once I left my room I made my way to the monitoring room. I plugged the drive in and began waiting. It was moving slow. Each increase in completion percentage feeling like hours. Thats when it happened. A guard walked in. The one that barked at us last night on dec to get back inside. “You’re not supposed to be in here!” He said assertively, raising his rifle at me. I lifted my hands, my eyes quickly darting away from the hard drive sticking out from the computer next to me. I hoped he wouldn’t, but he noticed and then told me to get on my knees. I obliged. As he walked over I quickly threw myself up and into him, pushing him toward the nearest wall. 



We were around the same size. While he was still stunned I jammed my elbow into his forearm and he dropped his assault rifle and it fell to his hip, still attached to the sling over his shoulder. We grappled arms and he swept my leg from under me. I dropped, but wrapped myself around him, pulling him with me. HE landed on top, throwing blows at my head as I threw up my arms to cover myself. I managed to block one and grab his hand. In the same instant I dislodged the knife from his shoulder harness and lifted it up about and inch and turned it, pushing into the side of his neck. His fight weakened and his eyes widened. Blood seeped from the wound as he grabbed at the knife, stammering to do so while falling off me and onto the floor. He stopped moving shortly thereafter. 



I looked up at the computer and the screen displayed a completed message. I yanked the drive out and walked out of the room, catching my breath and trying not to think about what happened in there. I had to move fast though. I decided to just run for it. Within a few seconds I was mantling over the side of the ships railing and onto the life vessel. I turned the hatch and entered. The craft booted up upon me locking the latch. “Prepare for release. Prepare for release.” A loudspeaker said. The craft dropped and then landed softly, bobbing for a second and then settling, swaying slowly. I ran through the checklist sitting on the pilot seat. Simple enough. 



The engine whirred and the ship sailed away under my command. I just turned it away from the scene and pushed the throttle full. About ten minutes went by and a huge flash filed the cabin. I looked out the back porthole as a huge half orb of lightning exploded from the ocean surface encapsulating the airship, research vessel, and all nearby boats, looking as if it descended down into the depths below as well. A purple glow filled the orb and lightning flashed everywhere. Then, everything inside disappeared. A large series of waves rushed out, causing some large bumps in the life vessel ride for a minute or so. I don’t know whats next. I don’t know where is safe. I remember something about an island I had written coordinates for before we got onboard the ship. Related to this place. Seems like a good place to look for answers. Because I have more questions than answers.



…



And thats it. The hard drive is all the footage mentioned in the journal. Nothing else. I, like most of you I’m sure, am left with more questions than answers. Did something get released into our world from…elsewhere? Somewhere we can’t fully comprehend or maybe even perceive? I’ve scoured over the data in the drive doing my best to google the physics I don’t know along the way. The best I could tell was that these creatures, these… things. They were from another dimension. Somewhere in between our universe’s space and time. Another plane of existence. A dimension separate from ours, but now connected from whatever went on. 



Jack is still missing. I drove around town, went to his local coffee shops, and scoured his apartment for clues. I checked his social media. All his pages were gone. Account disabled. I was shaking. I called back his mom. She had answered excitedly as if I was the one calling with news. She sounded discouraged when I had asked the same question she had. She hadn’t gotten anything either.



I had an idea. I drove over to Jack’s apartment and parked down the block. I waited until night fell and then looked down ash the front of his building. A black van pulled up. The same style one that followed me home from the airport. It blocked my view of his apartment door but it stayed there for about ten minutes, and then left. I waited another hour after it drove off to be safe. Then I walked over to Jack’s apartment. 



I put my palm over the array of buttons, buzzing as many random numbers as I could. When one replied I pretended to drunkenly slur a sentence in the intercom that amounted to “cant… forgot keys… apartment at bar.” A few seconds and then a buzz. The door opened and I went up the stairs to Jack’s floor. I had a key to his place. I opened his door and nothing seemed out of place. I walked around, scouring for clues. After I walked by his computer setup, it booted on like it knew I was there. I looked over. 



A video queued itself up. I walked over and clicked play. It was the inside of a storage container. A light was dangling overhead and there was Jack. Chained to the floor by the ankles, sitting in a chair, tape over his mouth. A woman walked into frame. She was facing away from the camera and toward Jack. Without hesitation she unholstered a pistol and lifted it to Jack’s head. His head began to move in a panic and then it stopped. A flash and then a small spray from the back of his head. Red liquid dripped from the wound in his head onto the floor around him. 



The woman lowered the gun, holstered it, and picked up the shell casing. She was wearing all black. She walked out of frame and then a note slowly lifted in front of the camera. It read one word. “STOP” Then, the note lowered, revealing the woman’s face peering into the camera. Like she was trying to make eye contact with me. Only… she couldn’t. Here eyes were black. Her skin adorned with glowing veins. I recognized her. from the hard drive. The dive footage. The diver. Jen.",2,1744338134.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False
1jwfasy,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jwfasy/update_i_found_something_i_shouldnt_have_part_4/,[UPDATE] I found something I shouldn't have... (Part 4 FINALE),"I didn’t know if I was going to post after the past few days. But everything was already typed up and saved I just… sat on it I guess. But now I’ve decided I don’t care. Whatever happens to me happens. After I posted part three, some oddities happened on my account. I’m not going to dive into theories I’m just going to state the facts. I posted. Next morning, posts were still saying pending although they had comments and upvotes. Then they were all taken down as well as everything in my profile. I tried refreshing pages, rebooting routers, but nothing worked. Few hours later everything was back to normal after I called Jack and he did some backend computer work I couldn’t begin to comprehend or explain. For the story thus far, I’d normally post a link in the beginning of this to each part, but I’m gonna ask you to just go to my profile. The other parts are all there. For those already caught up, continue reading.



It’s like someone knew I was onto something and tried to wipe it, but failed. Then it happened. I got a call from Jacks mom. Not too weird but definitely out of the ordinary. She was panicked I could tell immediately. Asking if I heard from Jack. I hadn’t since the day before when he fixed my account. She went to his apartment this morning and his car was in the driveway but no sign of him. I told her I’d try to call then get back to her. The phone rang but immediately went to voicemail. I called back his mom and told her. She was going to the police. I tried to talk her out of it saying I’d try looking first some more. Thank god I couldn’t. I agreed to meet her at the station. Mother’s intuition is a crazy thing sometimes.



She was arguing with the officer who was clearly a kid fresh out of the academy who was just trying to follow procedure. He politely and professionally told us we can’t file a missing persons report for 48 hours. Jack’s mom wasn’t hearing it, and shortly thereafter, a detective overhead and came over looking more like he was trying to save the front desk officer than have genuine interest in our case. He sat us both down and asked what happened. We told him what we know, gave him Jack’s information, and he started to dial his phone right at his desk. “Sure you wrote down the right number, kid?” He asked me.



I looked confused. It was the right number for sure. “Says the number is no longer in service.” He added. “That’s impossible. It went to his voicemail recording this morning.” I replied. The detective looked at me slightly puzzled, wrote something down, then said he’d be in touch. He shook our hands and gave us his card in case there were updates. I told Jack’s mom I’d continue to do what I could and we went our separate ways. My head was spinning. This all had to be tied together, right? Something was telling me that whatever was going on with Jack was someone’s (or something’s) revenge for finding what we did. I went home and poured back over the rest of the journal I had already scoured. Here it is for you guys to see:

February 20th, 2025



Dive day. The plan this morning is to go meet with Captain, then get all our equipment and monitoring devices set up and checked before we do final checks with the divers. I also forgot to mention the divers. Because they have to basically free-dive at that depth, they’re in a saturation chamber to acclimate their bodies to the pressure at depth. Normally for commercial sat divers, they need weeks of living in a pressurized chamber. But the Navy brought over some special saturation chamber they had on the aircraft carrier. That mixed with a newly developed intravenous cocktail, they only needed 24 hours in the chamber before going to the dive bell. Its going to be difficult to run final checks since they go directly from the chamber to the dive bell. But if I’ve seen anything in my time on board this ship its that everyone is oddly prepared. and by “everyone” I mostly mean the Navy. Having contingencies or plans in place like they had trained for this. 



The dive is scheduled for 0357UTC (11:57pm EST for reference). From what I’m told, conditions are ideal topside, both weather and currents included. I got to see the monitoring station where I’ll be during the dive. It is the newest and most high tech equipment. Looked fresh out of the box. I have a team of five people under me. James was my number two and we had three additional techs from MaritimeX. I’d be overseeing the dive in its entirety, monitoring the live footage from the diver helmets on a set of computer monitors. Id also have a headset with a direct line to the divers. No delays or interference at all. Or so I’m promised. Some sort of military tech. Obviously this being a military-involved operation, all the civilians were made to sine nondisclosure agreements. I didn’t know if i fell in the “civilian” or “military” category, so this journal is sort of a legal gray area. I like to tell myself that at least.

February 21st, 2025



My god. It was terrible. So terrible. Theres so much to tell I don’t know where to begin. My heart is pounding and my brain is racking itself trying to find some logical explanation for all of this. I’ll start from the morning of the dive. James and I ran through the plan once again with the team in the monitoring station. The techs ran us through a quick demo of how to use the basic parts of the dive cameras. I had a set of four screens in front of me. Three showing the helmet and body camera footage from each diver, and the fourth was from a submersible ROV unit that I was able to freely control. The techs set it up so it was operated with a video game style controller. Easy enough for anyone to use with some basic pointers. James had the same setup.





The divers exited their chambers into the dive bells. The adorned their suits. These weren’t the big astronaut looking ones you normally see in saturation divers that were hooked to the bell by a lifeline (a series of intertwined cables feeding air, hot water, and other important necessities straight to the diver suit). They still had helmets encapsulating their whole head, smaller, and atop sat a series of lenses and goggles that could be dropped down and interchanged. The suits were sleek, but clearly reinforced. Sort of like Iron Man, but less flashy and more subtle. A worker came over to each diver and used a power drill to secure the bolts of the helmets to the suits at the neck area. Then again but this time around the wrists and ankles where the gloves and boots met the rest of the body. We could see them through a glass wall that separated us from the airlock where the chamber met the bell. The divers gave a thumbs up to the worker, then each other.



On the wall near them were three assault-rifle style looking objects. Each diver picked one up and sighted it down and checked around on some features I couldn’t make out. They weren’t normal guns. But definitely a gun. Some sort of advanced infantry-style weaponry. I noticed their dive knives were located in sheaths on their shoulders. Thats a more tactical placement. Divers in my experience keep them somewhere on the thigh. The more and more I stared, the divers appeared to have combat features on their suits. They looked at us and tested communications. Before I could ask what the guns were, Captain Downes came over my shoulder and pressed the comms button. “Loud and clear.” He said into the headset microphone I was wearing. He and the divers exchanged another thumbs up then they disappeared, one by one into the diving bell.



“Weapons?” I looked up and asked Downes. “It was need-to-know at the time. Had to get you here no matter what.” He replied, looking almost apologetic. “Its alright.” I replied. And I was genuine, it was more so the confusion of why need weapons on a dive? I’d never heard of that. “But why?” I added. Captain Downes stood up and signaled me over to a corner of the room, away from James and the other techs. “I know you saw the shadows in those videos. I saw it in your eyes. It was the same look I had the first time I saw one. We have every reason to believe whatever these “openings” are down there, they’re letting something in. Humanoid, shadow like creatures. They don’t move normally, they can fly freely through the water as if it isn’t there, teleport from one location to the next, its unlike anything we’ve ever seen.” He was talking hurriedly, what seemed like a mixture of fear and excitement, but most of all uncertainty. 



“We’ve only got one recorded interaction, and it was brief. Caught on a stationary dive cam down in the site. One of our floodlights had broken just as one of those shadows was next to it. Although we caught it in a frame-by-frame analysis, the thing totally dissipated briefly, then reformed once the electric burst from the lightbulb was extinguished. The weapons they have are precautionary. Military has contingency for everything. The guns fire high frequency, targeted electromagnetic waves inside an artificial air pocket that will burst upon contact with target. Tested thoroughly, and is all but ready for widespread military use. If all goes well, you’ll hear about it in the news within the coming months. This was all so much. But I was relieved in a sense. I’m glad I wasn’t crazy in seeing those shadow-things. Even more glad I wasn’t the one to have to bring it up.



The dive bell was hoisted off the deck of the ship by a large hydraulic crane. It was suspended over the water, then it dropped, maintaining a thick rope of intertwined wires and tubing that were kept together with a transparent nylon material. The dive bell was connected to the ship, sharing its air and heating regulation systems, as well as direct communication lines to the vessel. It took about four hours to reach the site. Once it arrived, the bell stopped descending and sat hovering over the sunken cul-de-sac. Another equipment and communications checklist run-through for both the dive team and us, and then the hatch at the bottom of the bell opened. 



A cage descended with three walls jutting out from the center, and each diver was standing in their own tight section of it. Inside the bell stayed one technician diver who maintained the systems inside and kept in contact with the surface. A latch opened on the cage and each diver stepped out. What looked liked air hissed out from the tops of the dive suit’s backpacks, and all three divers were swiftly propelled downward, slowing once their boots reached the ocean floor. Their boots lit up at the soles, almost looking like they had magnetized to the surface. The nerd in me was going crazy over getting to see all this new technology the military doesn’t tell us about. But part of me also knew that if they were willing to take the risk of civilians being exposed to it, whatever is going on here is serious, and maybe out of military control.



The divers fanned out like a tactical unit, sweeping their immediate surroundings with the flashlights mounted on their guns, as well as the ones protruding from their suits. I watched through each divers live feed. It was in first person and I was so engrossed in the screen it was eerily feeling like I was down there with them. I was happy I wasn’t. They went into the first house. Furniture floated around lifelessly. Some light creeped in through broken windows coming from the floodlights we had set up around the perimeter of the site. Nothing substantial enough to warrant unaided visibility though. 



Ray’s camera view looked down as he removed a device from his belt. It was some sort of device giving off electromagnetic radiation readings, with a bar of color going from green on the left, then transitioning to yellow, then red on the right. A needle danced in the center of the green area. Ray pointed it around some more, stopping on one direction where the needle spiked briefly. He looked up and over, waving his hand in the direction the device was pointing. The Dan and Jen nodded, and the three stacked up in a line, walking forward toward a set of stairs. Slowly and methodically, they moved up the stairs, each step seeming to lock in place from their boots. But they moved with ease.



Dan was the first at the top of the stairs. He looked to his left, then right. A small hallway on either side, one section led to the open ocean through a decimating hole in the roof. The other side had a room with no door. The team moved in, clearing it quickly. A crib floated pushing up on the ceiling, and stuffed animals with frayed or missing appendages floated in a corner by a small bookshelf adorned with colorful children’s books. Ray looked back down at the device. “The needle still resided in the green zone. “Clear.” His voice echoed in the headset in my ear. The team then free swam out of the house via the hole in the roof and then over to another semi-standing house’s rooftop. Something beeped and then Ray’s camera showed the device again, with the needle in the center of the spectrum now, locked in place in the yellow. “Entering.” Jen said. They swam through a broken window that they were able to pull the frame out of. When they were inside, their boots locked back into the floor. They swept each room. Two bedrooms and a bathroom. All so out of place this deep underwater. The place was furnished, but it was allegedly a test site? It looked lived in. But then why the mannequins? I had more questions than answers. 



Before I could think of another All three dive cameras lit up bright white. After a second or two, they dimmed, and all of them were fixated on what was in front of them of them. They were getting ready to go down to the first floor of the house when at the bottom of the stairs, a glowing purple slit appeared in front of them, surrounded by pulsating grayish-black stone like objects, lit up by the back glow of this opening. Before anyone could say anything a shadow whipped out of the portal and then it closed. The room was dark again. Still. Like it should be 15,000 feet underwater. Only right now, it shouldn’t have been. 



“CLEAR TO ENGAGE!” Captain Downes grabbed the headset off me and yelled into the microphone piece. Before I could talk to him he ran over to the satellite phone hooked on the wall. I watched as the divers’ views all went in different directions, the shadow figure dancing between the monitors my eyes were locked on. A flurry of bright shots emanated from their weapons, and one seemed to make contact. Everyone immediately grabbed their heads. A shriek so loud it felt like my brain was being violently shaken screamed in my skull. I imagine the same thing for everyone happened as we all briefly convulsed in agony. 



I looked back at the dive cameras. The creature began to dissipate, but then through Jen’s camera, I could see it wrapping itself around Dan. He was unable to move. Locked in place. I could see his face and his eyes went black. His veins glowed in his face and down his neck. His mouth began to open as if to say something, and then, the creature stretched out an elongated arm and simply tapped the glass on the face of Dan’s helmet. The creature disappeared and in the same second, I saw Dan return to his body. The real dan. He looked shaken. Then immediately panicked. Before I could realize, a huge crack in the glass formed covering his face. And then… it was like a red mist just kind of spilled out when the pressure caved it in. I looked away. 



“DIVE TEAM RETURN TO BELL NOW!” The diver in the bell screamed over the shared communications line. The lights in the room shut and were replaced with a glowing red one. Over the PA system an automated voice said all too calmly: “This is a lockdown. Remain in your stations. This is a lockdown. Remain in your stations.” Then it stopped sounding. My gaze fixed back to the divers. It would take them about a half hour to get back to the dive bell and they knew they didn’t have time to spare. I could feel the ship began to move. Within ten minutes it was shaking violently. I could see through a window that a violent lightning storm had seemingly come from nowhere. Thunder clapped and rain poured shortly thereafter. I waited as the divers were still a little bit aways from the safety of the bell. Although as each minute passed, the dive bell became less safe. The ship 15,000 feet above it, connected by a long run of wire, violently being tossed around ten to twenty foot waves. 



Static began to crackle in and out of all the screens in the room. The techs assured me it wasn’t the machines, but rather “outside interference.” That was the term they used. The monitors came back on after awhile and I could see that Jen and Ray’s dive cameras were looking up at the bell, getting closer and closer to being right below it. Again, a bright light filled their screens, as well as the submersibles. I had been following them loosely on their way back seeing as the ROV couldn’t fit into any of the structures.



The monitors focused again and Ray and Jen looked at the seabed around them. Those purple tears were popping up left and right, shadowy humanoids, some crawling, others dashing their way out of these openings. There was more darkness than there was light. The only thing I could see was Jen’s camera looking up at the dive bell. Shadows danced around the cable atop it, as it floated in the surrounding ocean. Then one of the things passed through the wire, leaving a glowing purple line sizzling through the circumference of the cable. Then another. And another. The glow subsided, and the cables simply just… separated. The bell began to slowly sink down before landing a few hundred feet in front of the divers. Jen’s camera looked over to Ray, and a shadow disappeared as it flew into him. Like Dan, his eyes went black and his veins glowed. Then, all the computers in the room shut. Static then off inna instant.



The room was quiet. “All crew on deck. All crew on deck.” Came over the PA system in the same, stoic voice. I checked my watch. 1239UTC. Sunset exactly. I guess the situation warranted no more curfew. The deck was loud and windy, still pouring rain. Captain Downes stood out there, waiting for us all to file out. He had a tablet in front of him. “RAMIREZ, HANSON, JACKSON, DAVIS, WILLIAMS, TYLERS, WATKINS, AND JONES. FOLLOW ME!” He yelled over the gusting wind and rain. There were a lot of armed soldiers on board now. Once Downes walked them out past the main deck, James being one of them, down toward the port side and out of our sightline, the guards lined up in front of us, forming a sort of blockade. “YOU MAY RETURN TO YOUR QUARTERS.” One barked at the few of us left.

We were individually escorted back to our rooms and then a guard shut the door behind me. I assumed he was still standing outside. On the way to me room though I saw something. Glancing out a window on the port side, I caught a glimpse of Captain Downes, arm extended toward something out of my view. Then a flash. Followed by him stepping to the side with another flash following. Like he was moving down a line. Were those names of people he read a kill list? I don’t know. I’m going to lay down but I’m sure as hell I won’t sleep.

I returned to my room, sat for a few minutes, planning my next move. I’m going to return to the monitor station, take the hard drive loaded with movies and shows to pass time, wipe it, then download a copy of the ships data. Theres a main system I was given access to that nobody else on my team was. It stored everything in one place, so I could download from there. After that I’d make a move for one of the life vessels that could be piloted hanging off the side of the deck. Wherever that helicopter was going was not somewhere I wanted to be.

I lifted my hands, my eyes quickly darting away from the hard drive sticking out from the computer next to me. I hoped he wouldn’t, but he noticed and then told me to get on my knees. I obliged. As he walked over I quickly threw myself up and into him, pushing him toward the nearest wall. 



We were around the same size. While he was still stunned I jammed my elbow into his forearm and he dropped his assault rifle and it fell to his hip, still attached to the sling over his shoulder. We grappled arms and he swept my leg from under me. I dropped, but wrapped myself around him, pulling him with me. HE landed on top, throwing blows at my head as I threw up my arms to cover myself. I managed to block one and grab his hand. In the same instant I dislodged the knife from his shoulder harness and lifted it up about and inch and turned it, pushing into the side of his neck. His fight weakened and his eyes widened. Blood seeped from the wound as he grabbed at the knife, stammering to do so while falling off me and onto the floor. He stopped moving shortly thereafter. 



I looked up at the computer and the screen displayed a completed message. I yanked the drive out and walked out of the room, catching my breath and trying not to think about what happened in there. I had to move fast though. I decided to just run for it. Within a few seconds I was mantling over the side of the ships railing and onto the life vessel. I turned the hatch and entered. The craft booted up upon me locking the latch. “Prepare for release. Prepare for release.” A loudspeaker said. The craft dropped and then landed softly, bobbing for a second and then settling, swaying slowly. I ran through the checklist sitting on the pilot seat. Simple enough. 



The engine whirred and the ship sailed away under my command. I just turned it away from the scene and pushed the throttle full. About ten minutes went by and a huge flash filed the cabin. I looked out the back porthole as a huge half orb of lightning exploded from the ocean surface encapsulating the airship, research vessel, and all nearby boats, looking as if it descended down into the depths below as well. A purple glow filled the orb and lightning flashed everywhere. Then, everything inside disappeared. A large series of waves rushed out, causing some large bumps in the life vessel ride for a minute or so. I don’t know whats next. I don’t know where is safe. I remember something about an island I had written coordinates for before we got onboard the ship. Related to this place. Seems like a good place to look for answers. Because I have more questions than answers.



…



And thats it. The hard drive is all the footage mentioned in the journal. Nothing else. I, like most of you I’m sure, am left with more questions than answers. Did something get released into our world from…elsewhere? Somewhere we can’t fully comprehend or maybe even perceive? I’ve scoured over the data in the drive doing my best to google the physics I don’t know along the way. The best I could tell was that these creatures, these… things. They were from another dimension. Somewhere in between our universe’s space and time. Another plane of existence. A dimension separate from ours, but now connected from whatever went on. 



Jack is still missing. I drove around town, went to his local coffee shops, and scoured his apartment for clues. I checked his social media. All his pages were gone. Account disabled. I was shaking. I called back his mom. She had answered excitedly as if I was the one calling with news. She sounded discouraged when I had asked the same question she had. She hadn’t gotten anything either.



I had an idea. I drove over to Jack’s apartment and parked down the block. I waited until night fell and then looked down ash the front of his building. A black van pulled up. The same style one that followed me home from the airport. It blocked my view of his apartment door but it stayed there for about ten minutes, and then left. I waited another hour after it drove off to be safe. Then I walked over to Jack’s apartment. 



I put my palm over the array of buttons, buzzing as many random numbers as I could. When one replied I pretended to drunkenly slur a sentence in the intercom that amounted to “cant… forgot keys… apartment at bar.” A few seconds and then a buzz. The door opened and I went up the stairs to Jack’s floor. I had a key to his place. I opened his door and nothing seemed out of place. I walked around, scouring for clues. After I walked by his computer setup, it booted on like it knew I was there. I looked over. 



A video queued itself up. I walked over and clicked play. It was the inside of a storage container. A light was dangling overhead and there was Jack. Chained to the floor by the ankles, sitting in a chair, tape over his mouth. A woman walked into frame. She was facing away from the camera and toward Jack. Without hesitation she unholstered a pistol and lifted it to Jack’s head. His head began to move in a panic and then it stopped. A flash and then a small spray from the back of his head. Red liquid dripped from the wound in his head onto the floor around him. 



The woman lowered the gun, holstered it, and picked up the shell casing. She was wearing all black. She walked out of frame and then a note slowly lifted in front of the camera. It read one word. “STOP” Then, the note lowered, revealing the woman’s face peering into the camera. Like she was trying to make eye contact with me. Only… she couldn’t. Here eyes were black. Her skin adorned with glowing veins. I recognized her. from the hard drive. The dive footage. The diver. Jen.",6,1744338131.0,nosleep,0,0.88,False
1jwfarh,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1jwfarh/update_i_found_something_i_shouldnt_have_part_4/,[UPDATE] I found something I shouldn't have... (Part 4 FINALE),"I didn’t know if I was going to post after the past few days. But everything was already typed up and saved I just… sat on it I guess. But now I’ve decided I don’t care. Whatever happens to me happens. After I posted part three, some oddities happened on my account. I’m not going to dive into theories I’m just going to state the facts. I posted. Next morning, posts were still saying pending although they had comments and upvotes. Then they were all taken down as well as everything in my profile. I tried refreshing pages, rebooting routers, but nothing worked. Few hours later everything was back to normal after I called Jack and he did some backend computer work I couldn’t begin to comprehend or explain. For the story thus far, I’d normally post a link in the beginning of this to each part, but I’m gonna ask you to just go to my profile. The other parts are all there. For those already caught up, continue reading.

It’s like someone knew I was onto something and tried to wipe it, but failed. Then it happened. I got a call from Jacks mom. Not too weird but definitely out of the ordinary. She was panicked I could tell immediately. Asking if I heard from Jack. I hadn’t since the day before when he fixed my account. She went to his apartment this morning and his car was in the driveway but no sign of him. I told her I’d try to call then get back to her. The phone rang but immediately went to voicemail. I called back his mom and told her. She was going to the police. I tried to talk her out of it saying I’d try looking first some more. Thank god I couldn’t. I agreed to meet her at the station. Mother’s intuition is a crazy thing sometimes.

She was arguing with the officer who was clearly a kid fresh out of the academy who was just trying to follow procedure. He politely and professionally told us we can’t file a missing persons report for 48 hours. Jack’s mom wasn’t hearing it, and shortly thereafter, a detective overhead and came over looking more like he was trying to save the front desk officer than have genuine interest in our case. He sat us both down and asked what happened. We told him what we know, gave him Jack’s information, and he started to dial his phone right at his desk. “Sure you wrote down the right number, kid?” He asked me.

I looked confused. It was the right number for sure. “Says the number is no longer in service.” He added. “That’s impossible. It went to his voicemail recording this morning.” I replied. The detective looked at me slightly puzzled, wrote something down, then said he’d be in touch. He shook our hands and gave us his card in case there were updates. I told Jack’s mom I’d continue to do what I could and we went our separate ways. My head was spinning. This all had to be tied together, right? Something was telling me that whatever was going on with Jack was someone’s (or something’s) revenge for finding what we did. I went home and poured back over the rest of the journal I had already scoured. Here it is for you guys to see:

February 20th, 2025

Dive day. The plan this morning is to go meet with Captain, then get all our equipment and monitoring devices set up and checked before we do final checks with the divers. I also forgot to mention the divers. Because they have to basically free-dive at that depth, they’re in a saturation chamber to acclimate their bodies to the pressure at depth. Normally for commercial sat divers, they need weeks of living in a pressurized chamber. But the Navy brought over some special saturation chamber they had on the aircraft carrier. That mixed with a newly developed intravenous cocktail, they only needed 24 hours in the chamber before going to the dive bell. Its going to be difficult to run final checks since they go directly from the chamber to the dive bell. But if I’ve seen anything in my time on board this ship its that everyone is oddly prepared. and by “everyone” I mostly mean the Navy. Having contingencies or plans in place like they had trained for this. 



The dive is scheduled for 0357UTC (11:57pm EST for reference). From what I’m told, conditions are ideal topside, both weather and currents included. I got to see the monitoring station where I’ll be during the dive. It is the newest and most high tech equipment. Looked fresh out of the box. I have a team of five people under me. James was my number two and we had three additional techs from MaritimeX. I’d be overseeing the dive in its entirety, monitoring the live footage from the diver helmets on a set of computer monitors. Id also have a headset with a direct line to the divers. No delays or interference at all. Or so I’m promised. Some sort of military tech. Obviously this being a military-involved operation, all the civilians were made to sine nondisclosure agreements. I didn’t know if i fell in the “civilian” or “military” category, so this journal is sort of a legal gray area. I like to tell myself that at least.

February 21st, 2025

My god. It was terrible. So terrible. Theres so much to tell I don’t know where to begin. My heart is pounding and my brain is racking itself trying to find some logical explanation for all of this. I’ll start from the morning of the dive. James and I ran through the plan once again with the team in the monitoring station. The techs ran us through a quick demo of how to use the basic parts of the dive cameras. I had a set of four screens in front of me. Three showing the helmet and body camera footage from each diver, and the fourth was from a submersible ROV unit that I was able to freely control. The techs set it up so it was operated with a video game style controller. Easy enough for anyone to use with some basic pointers. James had the same setup.



The divers exited their chambers into the dive bells. The adorned their suits. These weren’t the big astronaut looking ones you normally see in saturation divers that were hooked to the bell by a lifeline (a series of intertwined cables feeding air, hot water, and other important necessities straight to the diver suit). They still had helmets encapsulating their whole head, smaller, and atop sat a series of lenses and goggles that could be dropped down and interchanged. The suits were sleek, but clearly reinforced. Sort of like Iron Man, but less flashy and more subtle. A worker came over to each diver and used a power drill to secure the bolts of the helmets to the suits at the neck area. Then again but this time around the wrists and ankles where the gloves and boots met the rest of the body. We could see them through a glass wall that separated us from the airlock where the chamber met the bell. The divers gave a thumbs up to the worker, then each other.



On the wall near them were three assault-rifle style looking objects. Each diver picked one up and sighted it down and checked around on some features I couldn’t make out. They weren’t normal guns. But definitely a gun. Some sort of advanced infantry-style weaponry. I noticed their dive knives were located in sheaths on their shoulders. Thats a more tactical placement. Divers in my experience keep them somewhere on the thigh. The more and more I stared, the divers appeared to have combat features on their suits. They looked at us and tested communications. Before I could ask what the guns were, Captain Downes came over my shoulder and pressed the comms button. “Loud and clear.” He said into the headset microphone I was wearing. He and the divers exchanged another thumbs up then they disappeared, one by one into the diving bell.



“Weapons?” I looked up and asked Downes. “It was need-to-know at the time. Had to get you here no matter what.” He replied, looking almost apologetic. “Its alright.” I replied. And I was genuine, it was more so the confusion of why need weapons on a dive? I’d never heard of that. “But why?” I added. Captain Downes stood up and signaled me over to a corner of the room, away from James and the other techs. “I know you saw the shadows in those videos. I saw it in your eyes. It was the same look I had the first time I saw one. We have every reason to believe whatever these “openings” are down there, they’re letting something in. Humanoid, shadow like creatures. They don’t move normally, they can fly freely through the water as if it isn’t there, teleport from one location to the next, its unlike anything we’ve ever seen.” He was talking hurriedly, what seemed like a mixture of fear and excitement, but most of all uncertainty. 



“We’ve only got one recorded interaction, and it was brief. Caught on a stationary dive cam down in the site. One of our floodlights had broken just as one of those shadows was next to it. Although we caught it in a frame-by-frame analysis, the thing totally dissipated briefly, then reformed once the electric burst from the lightbulb was extinguished. The weapons they have are precautionary. Military has contingency for everything. The guns fire high frequency, targeted electromagnetic waves inside an artificial air pocket that will burst upon contact with target. Tested thoroughly, and is all but ready for widespread military use. If all goes well, you’ll hear about it in the news within the coming months. This was all so much. But I was relieved in a sense. I’m glad I wasn’t crazy in seeing those shadow-things. Even more glad I wasn’t the one to have to bring it up.



The dive bell was hoisted off the deck of the ship by a large hydraulic crane. It was suspended over the water, then it dropped, maintaining a thick rope of intertwined wires and tubing that were kept together with a transparent nylon material. The dive bell was connected to the ship, sharing its air and heating regulation systems, as well as direct communication lines to the vessel. It took about four hours to reach the site. Once it arrived, the bell stopped descending and sat hovering over the sunken cul-de-sac. Another equipment and communications checklist run-through for both the dive team and us, and then the hatch at the bottom of the bell opened. 



A cage descended with three walls jutting out from the center, and each diver was standing in their own tight section of it. Inside the bell stayed one technician diver who maintained the systems inside and kept in contact with the surface. A latch opened on the cage and each diver stepped out. What looked liked air hissed out from the tops of the dive suit’s backpacks, and all three divers were swiftly propelled downward, slowing once their boots reached the ocean floor. Their boots lit up at the soles, almost looking like they had magnetized to the surface. The nerd in me was going crazy over getting to see all this new technology the military doesn’t tell us about. But part of me also knew that if they were willing to take the risk of civilians being exposed to it, whatever is going on here is serious, and maybe out of military control.



The divers fanned out like a tactical unit, sweeping their immediate surroundings with the flashlights mounted on their guns, as well as the ones protruding from their suits. I watched through each divers live feed. It was in first person and I was so engrossed in the screen it was eerily feeling like I was down there with them. I was happy I wasn’t. They went into the first house. Furniture floated around lifelessly. Some light creeped in through broken windows coming from the floodlights we had set up around the perimeter of the site. Nothing substantial enough to warrant unaided visibility though. 



Ray’s camera view looked down as he removed a device from his belt. It was some sort of device giving off electromagnetic radiation readings, with a bar of color going from green on the left, then transitioning to yellow, then red on the right. A needle danced in the center of the green area. Ray pointed it around some more, stopping on one direction where the needle spiked briefly. He looked up and over, waving his hand in the direction the device was pointing. The Dan and Jen nodded, and the three stacked up in a line, walking forward toward a set of stairs. Slowly and methodically, they moved up the stairs, each step seeming to lock in place from their boots. But they moved with ease.



Dan was the first at the top of the stairs. He looked to his left, then right. A small hallway on either side, one section led to the open ocean through a decimating hole in the roof. The other side had a room with no door. The team moved in, clearing it quickly. A crib floated pushing up on the ceiling, and stuffed animals with frayed or missing appendages floated in a corner by a small bookshelf adorned with colorful children’s books. Ray looked back down at the device. “The needle still resided in the green zone. “Clear.” His voice echoed in the headset in my ear. The team then free swam out of the house via the hole in the roof and then over to another semi-standing house’s rooftop. Something beeped and then Ray’s camera showed the device again, with the needle in the center of the spectrum now, locked in place in the yellow. “Entering.” Jen said. They swam through a broken window that they were able to pull the frame out of. When they were inside, their boots locked back into the floor. They swept each room. Two bedrooms and a bathroom. All so out of place this deep underwater. The place was furnished, but it was allegedly a test site? It looked lived in. But then why the mannequins? I had more questions than answers. 



Before I could think of another All three dive cameras lit up bright white. After a second or two, they dimmed, and all of them were fixated on what was in front of them of them. They were getting ready to go down to the first floor of the house when at the bottom of the stairs, a glowing purple slit appeared in front of them, surrounded by pulsating grayish-black stone like objects, lit up by the back glow of this opening. Before anyone could say anything a shadow whipped out of the portal and then it closed. The room was dark again. Still. Like it should be 15,000 feet underwater. Only right now, it shouldn’t have been. 



“CLEAR TO ENGAGE!” Captain Downes grabbed the headset off me and yelled into the microphone piece. Before I could talk to him he ran over to the satellite phone hooked on the wall. I watched as the divers’ views all went in different directions, the shadow figure dancing between the monitors my eyes were locked on. A flurry of bright shots emanated from their weapons, and one seemed to make contact. Everyone immediately grabbed their heads. A shriek so loud it felt like my brain was being violently shaken screamed in my skull. I imagine the same thing for everyone happened as we all briefly convulsed in agony. 



I looked back at the dive cameras. The creature began to dissipate, but then through Jen’s camera, I could see it wrapping itself around Dan. He was unable to move. Locked in place. I could see his face and his eyes went black. His veins glowed in his face and down his neck. His mouth began to open as if to say something, and then, the creature stretched out an elongated arm and simply tapped the glass on the face of Dan’s helmet. The creature disappeared and in the same second, I saw Dan return to his body. The real dan. He looked shaken. Then immediately panicked. Before I could realize, a huge crack in the glass formed covering his face. And then… it was like a red mist just kind of spilled out when the pressure caved it in. I looked away. 



“DIVE TEAM RETURN TO BELL NOW!” The diver in the bell screamed over the shared communications line. The lights in the room shut and were replaced with a glowing red one. Over the PA system an automated voice said all too calmly: “This is a lockdown. Remain in your stations. This is a lockdown. Remain in your stations.” Then it stopped sounding. My gaze fixed back to the divers. It would take them about a half hour to get back to the dive bell and they knew they didn’t have time to spare. I could feel the ship began to move. Within ten minutes it was shaking violently. I could see through a window that a violent lightning storm had seemingly come from nowhere. Thunder clapped and rain poured shortly thereafter. I waited as the divers were still a little bit aways from the safety of the bell. Although as each minute passed, the dive bell became less safe. The ship 15,000 feet above it, connected by a long run of wire, violently being tossed around ten to twenty foot waves. 



Static began to crackle in and out of all the screens in the room. The techs assured me it wasn’t the machines, but rather “outside interference.” That was the term they used. The monitors came back on after awhile and I could see that Jen and Ray’s dive cameras were looking up at the bell, getting closer and closer to being right below it. Again, a bright light filled their screens, as well as the submersibles. I had been following them loosely on their way back seeing as the ROV couldn’t fit into any of the structures.



The monitors focused again and Ray and Jen looked at the seabed around them. Those purple tears were popping up left and right, shadowy humanoids, some crawling, others dashing their way out of these openings. There was more darkness than there was light. The only thing I could see was Jen’s camera looking up at the dive bell. Shadows danced around the cable atop it, as it floated in the surrounding ocean. Then one of the things passed through the wire, leaving a glowing purple line sizzling through the circumference of the cable. Then another. And another. The glow subsided, and the cables simply just… separated. The bell began to slowly sink down before landing a few hundred feet in front of the divers. Jen’s camera looked over to Ray, and a shadow disappeared as it flew into him. Like Dan, his eyes went black and his veins glowed. Then, all the computers in the room shut. Static then off inna instant.



The room was quiet. “All crew on deck. All crew on deck.” Came over the PA system in the same, stoic voice. I checked my watch. 1239UTC. Sunset exactly. I guess the situation warranted no more curfew. The deck was loud and windy, still pouring rain. Captain Downes stood out there, waiting for us all to file out. He had a tablet in front of him. “RAMIREZ, HANSON, JACKSON, DAVIS, WILLIAMS, TYLERS, WATKINS, AND JONES. FOLLOW ME!” He yelled over the gusting wind and rain. There were a lot of armed soldiers on board now. Once Downes walked them out past the main deck, James being one of them, down toward the port side and out of our sightline, the guards lined up in front of us, forming a sort of blockade. “YOU MAY RETURN TO YOUR QUARTERS.” One barked at the few of us left.

We were individually escorted back to our rooms and then a guard shut the door behind me. I assumed he was still standing outside. On the way to me room though I saw something. Glancing out a window on the port side, I caught a glimpse of Captain Downes, arm extended toward something out of my view. Then a flash. Followed by him stepping to the side with another flash following. Like he was moving down a line. Were those names of people he read a kill list? I don’t know. I’m going to lay down but I’m sure as hell I won’t sleep.

February 22nd, 2025



My dreams were haunted by shadows. Figures I felt like I knew but couldn’t see. They all watched me. Staring. Studying. i woke up in a cold sweat. We were all woken up at the crack of dawn and the entire crew was in the dining area. Nobody mentioned on Captain’s list was there. The weather had calmed and I could hear a helicopter whirring overhead. It sounded close and then I could hear an engine powering down. Within minutes the General who had given us our initial briefing walked in, followed by Captain Downes. Nobody stood up. “You are all here because you can be trusted. The situation that unfolded here is to be referred to as a research study that yielded no results. No more details are to be given. To anyone. Ever.” He said firmly. “You will all be compensated generously for your assistance in this endeavor. As of this moment, this vessel as well as all equipment on it is property of the United States military. Go back to your quarters. Those of you with held equipment will find it returned upon your arrival. You have 1 hour to gather yourselves and report to the helicopter on deck.”



Nobody had time to raise their hand before they both exited the room. On the way back to my quarters, I took a detour outside. I examined the lower deck of the port side. Where I saw Captain last night. A guard was strolling a post up and down the length of the side. I crouched behind a container and moved quickly across the way to the railing of the ship, covered by a staircase. I traced the railing down as far as I could, but found nothing. While turning back around I heard a small clank at my foot. I moved my shoe aside and found a 9mm shell casing. I looked down the length of the deck and behind me and found two more that rolled up against the bottom of the staircase. That was enough to confirm my theory. The curfew. The list. That was the time they executed those who they didn’t think would be able to keep this under wraps. Innocent people who were here a week ago on their own. Researchers. Genuine researchers. Studying the world. Not whatever the hell they got dragged into.



I returned to my room, sat for a few minutes, planning my next move. I’m going to return to the monitor station, take the hard drive loaded with movies and shows to pass time, wipe it, then download a copy of the ships data. Theres a main system I was given access to that nobody else on my team was. It stored everything in one place, so I could download from there. After that I’d make a move for one of the life vessels that could be piloted hanging off the side of the deck. Wherever that helicopter was going was not somewhere I wanted to be. I’ll figure the rest out when I get back to land. 



………



Same day but last entry. I’m in the lifeboat now. Once I left my room I made my way to the monitoring room. I plugged the drive in and began waiting. It was moving slow. Each increase in completion percentage feeling like hours. Thats when it happened. A guard walked in. The one that barked at us last night on dec to get back inside. “You’re not supposed to be in here!” He said assertively, raising his rifle at me. I lifted my hands, my eyes quickly darting away from the hard drive sticking out from the computer next to me. I hoped he wouldn’t, but he noticed and then told me to get on my knees. I obliged. As he walked over I quickly threw myself up and into him, pushing him toward the nearest wall. 



We were around the same size. While he was still stunned I jammed my elbow into his forearm and he dropped his assault rifle and it fell to his hip, still attached to the sling over his shoulder. We grappled arms and he swept my leg from under me. I dropped, but wrapped myself around him, pulling him with me. HE landed on top, throwing blows at my head as I threw up my arms to cover myself. I managed to block one and grab his hand. In the same instant I dislodged the knife from his shoulder harness and lifted it up about and inch and turned it, pushing into the side of his neck. His fight weakened and his eyes widened. Blood seeped from the wound as he grabbed at the knife, stammering to do so while falling off me and onto the floor. He stopped moving shortly thereafter. 



I looked up at the computer and the screen displayed a completed message. I yanked the drive out and walked out of the room, catching my breath and trying not to think about what happened in there. I had to move fast though. I decided to just run for it. Within a few seconds I was mantling over the side of the ships railing and onto the life vessel. I turned the hatch and entered. The craft booted up upon me locking the latch. “Prepare for release. Prepare for release.” A loudspeaker said. The craft dropped and then landed softly, bobbing for a second and then settling, swaying slowly. I ran through the checklist sitting on the pilot seat. Simple enough. 



The engine whirred and the ship sailed away under my command. I just turned it away from the scene and pushed the throttle full. About ten minutes went by and a huge flash filed the cabin. I looked out the back porthole as a huge half orb of lightning exploded from the ocean surface encapsulating the airship, research vessel, and all nearby boats, looking as if it descended down into the depths below as well. A purple glow filled the orb and lightning flashed everywhere. Then, everything inside disappeared. A large series of waves rushed out, causing some large bumps in the life vessel ride for a minute or so. I don’t know whats next. I don’t know where is safe. I remember something about an island I had written coordinates for before we got onboard the ship. Related to this place. Seems like a good place to look for answers. Because I have more questions than answers.



…



And thats it. The hard drive is all the footage mentioned in the journal. Nothing else. I, like most of you I’m sure, am left with more questions than answers. Did something get released into our world from…elsewhere? Somewhere we can’t fully comprehend or maybe even perceive? I’ve scoured over the data in the drive doing my best to google the physics I don’t know along the way. The best I could tell was that these creatures, these… things. They were from another dimension. Somewhere in between our universe’s space and time. Another plane of existence. A dimension separate from ours, but now connected from whatever went on. 



Jack is still missing. I drove around town, went to his local coffee shops, and scoured his apartment for clues. I checked his social media. All his pages were gone. Account disabled. I was shaking. I called back his mom. She had answered excitedly as if I was the one calling with news. She sounded discouraged when I had asked the same question she had. She hadn’t gotten anything either.



I had an idea. I drove over to Jack’s apartment and parked down the block. I waited until night fell and then looked down ash the front of his building. A black van pulled up. The same style one that followed me home from the airport. It blocked my view of his apartment door but it stayed there for about ten minutes, and then left. I waited another hour after it drove off to be safe. Then I walked over to Jack’s apartment. 



I put my palm over the array of buttons, buzzing as many random numbers as I could. When one replied I pretended to drunkenly slur a sentence in the intercom that amounted to “cant… forgot keys… apartment at bar.” A few seconds and then a buzz. The door opened and I went up the stairs to Jack’s floor. I had a key to his place. I opened his door and nothing seemed out of place. I walked around, scouring for clues. After I walked by his computer setup, it booted on like it knew I was there. I looked over. 



A video queued itself up. I walked over and clicked play. It was the inside of a storage container. A light was dangling overhead and there was Jack. Chained to the floor by the ankles, sitting in a chair, tape over his mouth. A woman walked into frame. She was facing away from the camera and toward Jack. Without hesitation she unholstered a pistol and lifted it to Jack’s head. His head began to move in a panic and then it stopped. A flash and then a small spray from the back of his head. Red liquid dripped from the wound in his head onto the floor around him. 



The woman lowered the gun, holstered it, and picked up the shell casing. She was wearing all black. She walked out of frame and then a note slowly lifted in front of the camera. It read one word. “STOP” Then, the note lowered, revealing the woman’s face peering into the camera. Like she was trying to make eye contact with me. Only… she couldn’t. Here eyes were black. Her skin adorned with glowing veins. I recognized her. from the hard drive. The dive footage. The diver. Jen.",2,1744338128.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

The Seed Transformer isn’t available until Farmer Level 10, but it is worth it to get the new crops. All crops are regrowable and grow all year except in Winter unless stated otherwise.

If you’d like more ancient crops, check out this mod (link in comment) to see more mod details, compatibilities, special thanks, and more.

This has been your Daily Mod Spotlight. Check back tomorrow for another fantastic mod! ❤️

I wanted to see who might be around for breeding, or just a fun night(s) together. Irl or online ;) bonus if you're in Boston or San Diego.

A little about me, white, bwc, and a nice dad bod. I love a good cocktail, and I want to make sure you're always put first.

Id love to get you dinner, or coffee, and then we can spend every night or lunch enjoying the process. I prefer younger than me.",1,1744338008.0,YoungerGirl4OlderMen,0,0.66,False

1jwf8eb,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1jwf8eb/my_mom_gave_me_money_but_should_i_give_it_back/,"My mom gave me money, but should I give it back?","I’m (21 F) about to go to Mexico with my boyfriend. I’ve been working a lot and planning how I divide up my money till summer to pay for this vacation, one with my cousin, and tuition in the fall all while paying off my student loans. 

Now, for a while my mom (56 F) has been supporting me and along the way and I help her with some things too like, buying things online, or suggest what coffee maker to buy, I was also helping her learn more about opening a TFSA. 

Fast forward, my mom’s been trying to put $500 into her TFSA for a while or to open one up. This guy was sus at the bank and wouldn’t take her to a financial advisor and said he could set it up, so she decided not to open it up. 

Moving onto today, April 10th, I just got home, I did my dailies on Infinity Nikki, ate some dinner, showered, and I’ve been exhausted so I took a nap. My mom wakes me up from my nap and says “sorry I didn’t know you were sleeping.” And I say “it’s okay I was just taking a nap.” Not a minute later my mom walks out and I try to go back to sleep and wait for my alarm. 

4 minutes pass, not even my mom comes into my room and hands me a few bills of cash, being groggy, my eyes were shot when I noticed it was 5, $100 bills. 

My mom starts off saying “This is for you, you work so hard, it’s an early birthday present and some money for your trip, this is just from me. I wish I could give you more. You are doing so many things and I’m proud of you. I wish I was as independent as you.” My dad was away for a retirement party. I was chocked up, I manage to say “this is more than ever thought.” 

She gets sentimental and hides her tears but I can tell when she sniffled. My dad just walks in the front doors and my mom was quick to turn her head away from me. When she leaves my room and closes the door I hold the cash still in my hands and I start crying. I knew it was the money that she’s been trying to deposit in her TFSA because it’s the exact amount she’s been holding onto. 

She gets a $40 allowance if my dad been remembers to give it to her a week. More than three months of money saved up, that she wanted to put into her future, her retirement she had given to me. I kept crying because the amount is as much as I get in a paycheque. 

I know my mom really wants to learn and she’s trying her best to learn the things she’s been sheltered from I started crying again thinking about how she wished she was as independent as me. My mom hardly sees me, I’m always at work, with my boyfriend, or at school or planning something with my friends. I haven’t had time before my trip to spend time with her. 

With the money she gave me it can go towards the funds for my trip with my cousin, or I could pay it forward and open a TFSA and give it back to her one day to help my mom retire since she’s been working as a nurse for 25+ years. 

What should I do?

TLDR: My mom gave me $500, I pay my tuition plus still have loans and have two vacations planned for this year. My mom wants to retire, would’ve used the money to open a savings account? Do I put it in a savings account for her to give when she retires or use it for the expenses I have?",2,1744337918.0,family,3,1.0,False

I don’t know if you still order the same coffee.  
I don’t know if your favorite song has changed.  
It’s not my right to know  
if you’re going out this weekend  
or staying inside,  
playing it safe.

I do know  
that I still think of you when I order lemonade.  
I do know  
whenever our song comes on,  
it brightens my day.

It’s my right to grieve  
the tears I never cried.

What a blessing it is  
to find the shirt you wore  
on the first date  
with a woman you loved—

When one day,  
you’ll find the shirt you were wearing  
the day Mom died.
