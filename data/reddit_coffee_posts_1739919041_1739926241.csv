The scent of coffee made her flare her nostrils and lick her lips. The pungent aroma mixed with the dream that even now, in the first few seconds of consciousness, had faded, leaving her with its vague impression. In its wake was that familiar emptiness of having been robbed. She knew the setting from past episodes. The tiny parcel of land stuck between Ronan and Hot Springs. A decaying trailer house surrounded by winter wheat fields. They called it a farm with irony, for it possessed only a small garden, untouched for years, and a chicken coop that hadn’t seen occupants since the last owners. Neither she nor her father had a green thumb, nor were they any good with animals.

If not in this dream, then in her memories, he was always out working on the truck. His laptop on the picnic table he’d dragged up next to the rig was connected to a data port under the hood via a long cord, his red toolbox open like a surgical tray, an array of useful tools at hand as he attempted to decode the error messages on the jerry-rigged grid interface. He would run a hand through a shock of ginger hair, starchy from sweat and grease, leaving it to stand on end as a flag of his frustration. He had loved the truck, loved the mechanical work when it had an internal combustion engine. Now, he was always stressed, and he drank and smoked too much, forced to give up diesel for electric, forced to choose desperate and dangerous routes as the grid of autonomous shipping continued to expand.

Coffee was their solace. They would sit together on the porch in the early mornings before the world woke up. Under the twilight of the Big Sky, they’d listen to music or nothing, watching the dippers rotate over the Mission Mountains, year by year fading against the urban sprawl, rarely speaking, like silent monks at morning prayers.

This was a past that was dead. She resented how it followed her slumber in images and in her waking life as an angry longing. She yearned for those untarnished years when he had tried to make everything golden by encouraging a belief in things like Christmas or the ritual of baking a turkey once a year.

She needed to pee.

A faint morning blue from the small, rectangular window illuminated the pile of clothes that was the Greta in the corner of the room. The voiceless woman slept in her patchwork dress and mask. She wondered about her. She must have sustained those scars in the fire. What had that been, like fifteen years ago? The gathering of a hundred thousand Gretas in a field east of Modesto. One hundred thousand women covered in dry polyester and cotton on a dry day under a high sun. How the fire started remained a mystery, full of conspiracy and accusations, but a rogue spark carried by the Santa Ana winds caught a sleeve or a hem, a shawl or cowl, and not one could scream to warn the others. It had been on the news for weeks. The large gatherings stopped after that. These days, the ritualistic cuttings—to take the voice away in solidarity with the Earth Mother—were done in small, secret gatherings with security details carrying firearms.

She pulled on the leggings she’d discarded on the floor next to the bed along with the oversized t-shirt bearing the logo of a brand she didn’t recognize and let herself out of the room. She crept down the hall and closed the bathroom door behind her. When she was done, she tiptoed by the room where Carter Nash bunked with Bridger. The two men had become fast friends. Last night, she’d fallen asleep to their muffled voices. It was good to hear them laugh.

In addition to the two bedrooms and the bathroom, the basement of Katelyn’s house had a living room where the boys were passed out on a plush sofa from another era. It was planted in front of a giant television running a soundless cartoon of a cat chasing a mouse. In their peaceful slumber, Ty had an arm flopped over Francis, who had kicked a leg over Ty, at least one scar upon each puppish limb. She pulled the French doors together, separating them from the kitchen and her quest for coffee.

The kitchen-dining room was done up like an old 1950s diner, complete with the black and white checkered floor and a corner booth where Alan now slept in a forced crescent, an empty wine bottle on the table above him.

She watched him in the morning glow from another small window covered with azure curtains, worried that her movement could wake him up. The man wasn’t so much a drunk—it was that he drank to fall asleep. Her father was like that, toward the end. Christ, she’d done it, too. Something about haunted dreams… No, it was the memories, not the dreams, haunted memories, or rather memories that haunt, that was what kept you awake at night. Nonetheless, the wine-drunk sleep was deepest in the early hours before waking with a pounding headache, so she proceeded on her coffee mission with confidence.

The cupboard revealed a small package of Ceylon teabags wrapped in cellophane and another bottle of wine. She didn’t know if Alan had taken the house wine or if he’d brought it from the Jiffy Stop.

She put on her shoes and went up to the backyard. The brightness of the morning and a nip of frost made her eyes water. Behind the house was a covered patio full of shelves crammed with items that looked as though they could have been contenders in an antique roadshow. Two barbecues, one large and green, the other black, smaller and older by maybe fifty years, were dusted with snow. She stepped past these out from under the roof and lit a cigarette.

A large cottonwood rose from the center of the yard, its branches reaching into the gray sky like skeletal arms. From behind the tree, the little mop dog pranced around and kicked up snow like it had just taken a crap.

“Moby!” Katelyn called from the screen door. “Oh, I didn’t see you there, dear. Ms. Wolf, is it?”

“Just Gwen is fine,” said Gwen. “I thought I’d come up and get the circulation going.”

“Ah yes, the circulation of the humors. Cycles, circles, the repetition of things. It makes perfect sense. You were an early riser in your girlhood. Not afraid of cancer either, it seems.”

Gwen looked at her cigarette.

The woman stepped out in her robe and slippers. From one of the boxes, she retrieved an empty dog food can and set it on the tray of the black barbecue. “Don’t throw your butts in the yard. And maybe smoke by the back gate. Come on, Moby.” She picked up the dog and headed back inside. At the door, she turned. “My manners. I suppose I could offer you some coffee. I just started a pot. Come on in if you like. Mind your shoes.”

***

They sat in the dainty living room. Next to her, the large tabby, aptly named Moose, colonized half the sofa. When she tried to pet him, he woke from his coma long enough to take a half-hearted swing at her with his claws. The mop dog sat in the corner, eyeing her and issuing small growls now and then under its breath. She sipped from a dainty coffee cup, the darkest, richest coffee she’d ever tasted. It scalded her tongue, and the caffeine surged to her head.

“This is amazing coffee,” said Gwen.

“It’s nothing, dear. I’ll give you some to take downstairs. There should be a coffee pot underneath the sink. I had a boarder once, but he—” She stopped herself and studied Gwen. “Never mind him. It’s all about the quality of the ingredients and the care taken in preparation. I doubt your generation will ever understand that.”

“I suppose.” She thought it better to change the subject. “It’s a lovely little house.”

“It’s old. It’s falling apart. I’ve been here most of my life. It is my prison.”

“Well, at least you have a house. No one can afford one anymore.”

“You won’t believe what it took me to get this.” Katelyn’s voice rose with emotion. “Are you married?”

“No.”

“Then as a single woman, you know how we need to fight. No one ever handed me anything.”

She took another sip of the strong brew.

Against the far wall by the door was an upright piano stacked with books. To avoid the awkward conversation, she rose and inspected them. The pages of the one she picked up and opened were aged brown and brittle, written in an alphabet she’d never seen.

“It’s ancient Sami. From the top of the world.”

Gwen jumped. The woman stood next to her. She hadn’t heard her get up. She took the book from her hands and returned it to its place.

“You won’t find any of that smut you read in this house.”

“What makes you think I read smut?”

A furious tension crossed Katelyn’s face. “It’s very old.”

“What’s it about?”

“A ren carries a princess between the realms of the dead and the living.”

“A ren?”

“Reindeer.”

“It sounds interesting.”

“It’s magnificent.” Katelyn’s wrinkled hand touched the leather cover, as if to reassure the tome it was safe from the ignorant.

On the wall above the piano was a series of glass shelves populated with miniature glass figurines of children, some of them fishing, some of them angels.

She leaned in to get a closer look. A small mermaid in blue and yellow crystal appeared to gleam with a light of its own.

“Don’t touch them. They’re so delicate.”

“Trust me, I won’t.”

The old woman sighed at this reproach and returned to her rocking chair. “You’re the first guest I’ve had in… a long time.”

There were other shelves with dark, titleless books and knickknacks such as the resin statuette of a crimson dragon and a pair of neatly beaded baby booties. A large oil painting of a boat out at sea occupied the wall where any normal person would have put a television. Next to it, by the kitchen, hung the watercolor portrait of a beautiful woman, incomplete or never meant to be finished.

“Is this you?”

“Oh, that?” Katelyn placed a proper hand upon her chest. “Once upon a time, I suppose.”

The artist had captured a sense of grace and beauty, lips that could have been ravished by a lover and the flesh of a full breast and naked shoulder. It was in the eyes that she recognized her—dark, intense, furious.

“Who was the artist?” Gwen asked.

“You are a good cop. Full of questions,” said Katelyn.

Gwen turned to see her set her cup on the delicate glass saucer that rested on the delicate glass coffee table. “I’m not a cop anymore.”

“I realize. My brother told me of the situation.”

“Thank you for helping us.”

A stress wrinkle crossed her brow. “Help?” She laughed. “I would hardly call it help.”

“What I mean is, you gave us a place to stay. We really appreciate that. _I_ really appreciate that.”

“We do what we can. I just hope nothing happens.”

The noise of a car engine on the street caused her to get up and open the blinds just a sliver. “Come here,” she said. “Look. Do you recognize that car?”

An old beater was cruising down the street. “I don’t. Looks like some kids out joyriding.”

Katelyn let the blinds fall. “Do you really think that’s all it is?”

“Can I be frank with you?” Gwen asked.

“Obviously, you can be frank with me,” replied the woman.

“We’ve just been through a shitstorm.”

Katelyn chuckled. “You think you’re through it?”

“I’m fully aware—”

“You’re Maji now.”

“Pardon?”

“The boy down there…” Katelyn pointed at the floor. “…is a freak.”

“Excuse me?” said Gwen, immediately defensive of Francis. “He’s just a boy.”

The woman cackled, causing the dog to turn a nervous circle on the floor and the cat to lift its head.

“We were attacked. Francis—”

“Oh, he didn’t consent to it, but that’s what he is. And White Owl is using him like she uses everybody else.”

“White Owl?”

“The great White Owl. Sorceress from beyond the Veil. She’ll wring you out, and when you’re dry, she’ll ask you why you couldn’t do more.”

“So she’s real.”

“Real? A real cunt. I could tell you a hundred things that are as real as the nose at the end of your face, but you’d never believe them.”

“Give me one.”

“You are Maji. Ma-jee, Ma-hi. However one chooses to pronounce it. Or choose another name. We are known by many, but we’re all the same.”

“I’m me. Scots Irish—”

“You heard his music?” Again, she pointed to the floor.

“How does that mean anything?” asked Gwen.

“It’s in you now, and you can never take it out.”

“Fine. I heard his music. It doesn’t change anything. We need to clear our names.”

“It changes everything. Now you are the hunted.”

“The wolves?”

“They’re not wolves. Please, show some respect for Canis lupus.”

“The hunters. That’s what Francis calls them.”

“And you are the prey.” She was wringing her hand nervously.

“I should go. The others are probably getting up.”

Katelyn closed her eyes. Heretofore, her hair had been tied in a tight bun atop her head. She removed a pin and let it fall. It streamed across her bosoms and onto her lap. It was mostly black infused with strands of gray. The old woman was handsome, regal; no doubt she’d been breathtaking in her youth.

“Dear, I’m sorry. Listen, LJ brought you here because he didn’t know what else to do with you. I said I would help. I know you were a cop. I respect that. I’m going to dump some information on you and hope you can process it.”

“I’ll try,” said Gwen.

Katelyn poured them more coffee. “Woman to woman. Maji to Maji. Certain times in our lives, it is necessary to suspend our disbelief.”

“I’ve seen a lot as a cop,” said Gwen.

“I trust you have. I am Maji, as are my people going back into stories that are long forgotten. We have always known fear, and we’ve been taught how to hide and how to control our urges. But there are places and times on this earth when we can weave our enchantments without fear of attack. Auspicious days such as equinoxes and solstices, and other days that would seem random to you, but rest assured they are not random in the least. These are precious few. Once or twice in a lifetime. But that is enough, right? Not every living moment needs to be infested with magic. Once or twice to witness the great sublime. It must be this way as a matter of survival.

“About twenty years ago, something changed, and I wasn’t the only one to notice it. A group of young people who were not of Maji blood started to show symptoms. As they neared puberty, they began to manifest certain traits, the most concerning being the ability to pull from the Veil. This is what alerted them to the hunters.”

“Pulling from the Veil? What does that mean?”

“The Veil is of the primal matter. There are physicists and philosophers of our kind who can give you more sophisticated answers, assuming you can track them down. For our purposes, we just need to understand that it augments our… abilities. But like setting a beacon, it alerts other forces of the Maji’s whereabouts.”

“The hunters?”

“Indeed, and other… agents, other Maji. Don’t think for a moment that just because someone has Maji blood, they are your friend.

“The first person I met who exhibited these traits was a girl by the name of Marissa. She was a young, beautiful climate refugee living in a slum on the outskirts of the BAT. She had a way with animals. She could enter their minds and see through their eyes. She had no idea she was pulling from the Veil. I felt her very first enchantment wash over me like a tsunami. I found her easily enough and begged her to stop. But I was too late. To enchant is an addiction. A few nights later, her magic did stop, but not of her own volition. The hunters found her. They nailed her to the wall and pounded iron stakes through her eyes.”

“Jesus.”

“The newspapers called it gang violence. Not inaccurate, I suppose. Such extremes ensure death. There are others like her. I fear for them, but I also fear finding them. They are getting smarter as they develop, better at controlling their enchantments. From time to time, I sense their ripples, and often after, their signatures end forever. No doubt at the hand of the hunters.”

“How many?”

“It’s hard to say. In Billings alone, I have felt the presence of at least a hundred unique signatures. How many come from the old Maji bloodlines, and how many have… developed? It’s impossible to determine without conducting the kind of research that will get me killed.”

“What do you mean, ‘research?’” Gwen asked.

Katelyn looked at her fiercely. “Research. It’s a matter of developing your sensitivities. You ought to try it. I had a partner once, a woman by the name of Lethe Vonnix. It was she who discovered the link between the Maji and the Escape drug.”

“Wait,” said Gwen. “Vonnix? Dr. Lethe Vonnix?”

“You know of her?”

“Black hair, white face, looks kind of like a ghost?”

“Exactly like a ghost. You’ve met her?” asked Katelyn, leaning in toward Gwen.

“She found Alan and me at a Halloween party up in Polson.”

“Oh, she’s a tenacious investigator, takes the ethnographic approach to fieldwork. She thinks she’s fucking Indiana Jones. She’s as old as me, you know. Makes you want to book her plastic surgeon in advance. Yes, we were research partners once upon a time. We did sorrowful work back then with the Viking and White Owl. But in the end…” The woman trailed off, her dark eyes sparkling and remembering. “In the end, we could not get over certain stumbling blocks. I’m sorry to be vague. Perhaps another time. May I ask, what did Lethe want?”

“I remember,” said Gwen, “she wanted to know how Alan intended to help Francis.”

“Of course. The boy concerns her greatly. The fact that she has taken the risk and returned to the United States, no doubt drawn here by White Owl’s activities, is ominous news.”

“You said the Escape drug turns someone into a Maji?” Gwen inquired.

“There’s a strain, dark work indeed. We suspected a chemist from the Den, perhaps the Sisters, but we couldn’t verify it. The addict must be pregnant.”

“Not of Maji blood,” Gwen echoed Katelyn’s words.

The woman nodded gravely. “Freaks. I do not approve. But what can be done? These new Maji stumble into their so-called chants and fuck up, pardon my language, before they even realize what they’ve done. No one is there to teach them how to behave with their abilities. No one is there to teach them how to hide.” She laughed. “Vonnix is calling herself a doctor now, eh? Back then, Lethe took it upon herself to help these poor creatures. She got into some very deep trouble with the Den. I suggest you avoid her at all costs.”

“What’s the Den?” said Gwen, “And who are the Sisters?”

“Oh, officer, my, my, you really are in over your head. In very simple terms, the Den is where the hunters come from, and the Sisters are a sect therein. That’s neither here nor there, dear. Politics, you know. You can no more influence the machinations of the Den than you can the war between the Western Allies and FEEN. Our job is to stay alive.”

“How many… Escape Maji are there?” asked Gwen. Bridger’s wife had died due to her Escape addiction. This must be why the hunters wanted Ty.

“It’s hard to say. Hundreds? Thousands?”

“But Francis can help them. You should have seen the sheriff’s station that night. They came, so many. They needed him.”

“That boy’s music—” Katelyn pointed down. “It’s a double-edged sword. His music will encrypt—I believe that’s the word White Owl uses—but it will also infect people who are clean. People like you.”

“You talk like it’s a disease.”

“Isn’t it a goddamn disease?”

“If it’s a disease, then Francis is the cure,” said Gwen.

“No, he just makes the sickness harder to find, that’s all. Most Maji will never pull from the Veil in their entire lives. Their enchantments consist of growing record-winning squash or causing harmless pulses of light to infest translucent objects, reading the stars, cozy magic. You get the picture. Still, they may be hunted and killed. There is no justice in this world… or beyond.”

Outside on the street, the car was back revving its engine. Katelyn jerked the blinds open. Moby snarled and raised his hackles; the cat slept on.

“What are you afraid of?”

“My dear, there’s a lot to be afraid of when you are the hunted.”

“Yeah.” She sipped her coffee. They were being hunted. Now, like the fawn in the forest, they were lying low.

“The Chaos,” said Katelyn. “This is the real fear, the existential threat. That is when the Veil falls, when suffering is at the most, when nothing makes sense, and a ruler of darkness prevails.

“Jesus, it’s every bad horror movie I ever watched as a kid.”

“I’m quoting scripture, dear. It’s dogma in the Den. It is the righteous cause of the Sisters and their hunters. You need to know your enemies.”

“Yesterday, at the Jiffy Stop, Francis said he would pull from the Veil to help Ty. And that hunters would come.”

“And you fled, and you’re here. It’s been the plight of the Maji for longer than there’s time to tell.”

“I was never religious,” said Gwen.

Katelyn lifted her dainty coffee cup in salute. “Today, I will make fake IDs for everyone. I have a feeling you’re going to need them.”

“You’ll do them?”

“Of course. I make the best fake IDs. A gal needs a side hustle.”

The car’s music thumped through the walls.

The old woman jumped to her feet, threw open the door, raised her fist, and shouted, “People are trying to sleep!”

“Fuck you, lady,” one of the kids shouted, and the music faded down the block.",1,1739926084.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

Today I paid $5 with tip to get a black coffee with syrup from Foolish Craig's and it was legitimately not warm. Keep in mind it has been around 15 degrees today. I feel that black coffee is the most basic item to serve in a cafe and it should not be COLD. I've not had much better experiences at Laughing Goat. Prices are INSANE for the quality that they are serving. You can tell that their coffee has also been sitting around in the pot all day. My roommate bought a mocha yesterday that was more expensive than their signs advertised. It came out to $8 for a 12 oz iced mocha, which is like twice the price of STARBUCKS. She also said it was bad. 

But the worst one is the cafe that's replaced Pekoe. The last time I got a coffee from there, I noticed that their announcement that they were increasing prices. That would be fine if they were making better coffee to compensate. Not the case. The barista said to me ""There's a lot of grounds in this coffee. Do you want me to remake it?"" What??? 

In Boulder you would expect high quality coffee and probably prices to match that but these places are serving gas station quality. Please tell me this isn't just me and my roommate. ",2,1739926017.0,cuboulder,0,1.0,False

1isscep,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1isscep/aitah_for_setting_boundaries_with_my_mil_and/,AITAH for setting boundaries with my MIL and voicing how I feel finally?,"Okay, my MIL and I seemed to always have an okay relationship. She was happy when my husband and I first go together and the first thing she said about me was that I had ""childbearing hips,"" and would make for a good spouse. 

A few months into dating my boyfriend (now husband) his parents divorced. It was a very hard time for all, especially my boyfriend and his brother. Both of their parents kind of went ""off the rails,"" a bit. His mom was a stay at home mom since she was pregnant with my husband and for 600k from the divorce and does not/will not work. 

My boyfriend and I sided more with his mom on the divorce as we felt very bad for her. Not only was she going through a divorce she lost her father who she was very close with and she herself has some health issues. When my boyfriend and I went to finally move out on our own she very generously gifted us 12k to assist with our move and to have money as a ""safety net.""

Boyfriend and I lived together and about 4 years into dating got engaged. Mil was very excited as the next step was grandchildren once the wedding was done. We got married after 5 years of dating and I fell pregnant very shortly after that (I think it was three months after we got married). 

We told MIL as well as my mom who were both very excited, but it was around this time it felt like her behavior towards me changed. 

Anytime she talked about the expected baby she always called it ""my baby,"" which I didn't think much of at first. We invited them over for breakfast and were discussing babys arrival. I told her that we would call them when I was in labor, but I really only wanted my husband in the room. We were eating brunch at the time at my husband's and Is home and she ""accidently,"" spilled her piping hot coffee on me. I said ""ow!"" And got up trying to pat at the coffee stain with a towel and she looked at me and asked ""what's wrong?"" Not noting she had spilled coffee all over me. 

After this she asked my husband many times if she could be in the room and for him to force me to have her in the room. As the time got closer I asked my husband if it would be okay to have my mom in the room during birth to provide support and he said ""of course, you're the one birthing a whole human."" 

When the time came and I was in labor I had my mom and husband both with me. We called my MIL to let her know and she immediately had her partner drive her up and sat in the waiting room where she saw my step-dad waiting. She called me and asked if my mom was in the room. I told her ""yes."" She said I was being unfair and she needed to be there too as my mom should not hold ""her baby,"" first. 

I ended up agreeing as I felt bad and did not want to be acting like a bitch or jip her out of experiencing babies arrival. 

She joined us in the room and the entire time she was there was making comments towards me. She told me I was taking to long in labor, That her back hurt, that she was tired, etc. She finally said ""well, if it's going to take this long I'm getting a hotel room. Call me when my baby arrives.""

Well the time came and I was about to push. We called her and got VM so my husband called her partner. He said she was sleeping and he was not going to wake her. We said okay. They arrived about an hour after baby arrived and I passed baby over to her. A few minutes after the nurses took baby from her for their shots. MIL and her partner left and went home. Very shortly after I signed onto FB and saw that her partner had posted a photo of baby even though my husband was adamant about not posting babys photos online yet. 

When I got Discharged from the hospital we let them know asap and they drove over to our house. I was told I needed to apologize to MIL because she did not get to hold baby as long since the nurse took them for their shots. I did apologize and moved on as I did not feel like it was worth arguing over. 

Mil was constantly making comments about my parenting and would refer to herself as ""mama,"" when speaking to baby. Husband and I both WFH and needed some assistance with baby a big and asked MIL if she would like to come help and we would pay her as well as drive her back and forth since she cannot drive well. The only ask we had of her was that she not walk a ton with baby since her knees have bad issues and she falls a lot. Our other request was that she did not vape while holding the baby and to not talk badly about her ex-husband as we don't want that type of crap talking around little ears.

Well she was adamant about doing both of those things anytime she thought we were not looking. I saw her fall with baby in arms and then try lying about it. We also saw her vaping while holding baby many times. We have a camera in our livingroom, from the corner of my eye I saw her take a puff from her vape. I told my husband and when he addressed it she said I was lying. He said we have a camera in the livingroom (which was no secret, we have had it for years long before ever having kids) and he asked if she wanted him to look at the footage. She said he was invading her privacy and she would not be treated that way. 

Later that night (she was sleeping in our guest room) we heard her hysterically crying and screaming on the phone. It was 2am and we lived in under 900sq ft so sound travels pretty well. My husband knocked on the door and asked if she was okay. She replied that he was disrespectful and should mind his own business. He left and came back into our bedroom. 

My husband's grandma (mils mom) called us asking why we are treating mil poorly. She said she is also concerned for our babys safety. Mil lied to her and said that we don't allow her to read to baby and kept baby locked in a box all day (neither of these were true). When we asked mil she denied it. 

Adding in here too, husband and I go to marriage therapy. We had a lot of issues in our marriage prior to it even beginning. He came to me saying he had a major p*rn addiction and wanted help for it. We have shared this with mil and she laughed saying ""all men do it, what's the issue?"" Not taking into account that her son was the one wanting help for it himself. 

One day when we returned from therapy she kept asking what we talked about. Husband said he talked about potentially reconnecting with his dad. She blew up on him saying he was a bad son to her for wanting to do this and then proceeded to continue crap talk husband's dad. 

A few days later she said she was feeling dizzy. This is a regular occurrence she is on a unholy amount of meds for many different things. We took her blood pressure and it was very scary high. Husband and I talked and decided instead of having her for 5 days we would cut it back to 2-3 as we were worried about her health. She yelled at us for suggesting this and said we were taking away her only joy in life (our baby). 

Later that day she started yelling at us again, she said we were not being fair to her. This is where I definitely was the AH I started yelling back at her. To which she said she would not be disrespected by having me yell at her and that I was a child and she was an adult and I needed to listen to her. She called her partner asking him to leave his job and come pick her up saying no one wanted to talk to her or communicate to which I replied ""you're a fucking liar!!! All I have. Done is try talking to you! I always ask for your opinion on things and you never tell me how you feel, I am DONE!"" My husband offered to drive her home so her partner would not have to leave work. When she was leaving I told her that I was sorry for yelling, but I could not continue to let her walk all over me and treat me any way she wants. 

A month passed after not talking with her or seeing her. She reached out acting like nothing had happened and brought up our babies bday party. I told her she was still invited but there was not going to be any drama or hostility during it, she agreed. 

We had the party and she was fairly nice during it. I thought everything was fine. My husband's brother called us saying ""mom called me, and I know what she said isn't true, so can you tell me what really happened?"" I was very confused. He said she called him saying she never got to hold baby, and that when she finally did my mom ripped baby from her hands. That was not even close to what happened. She held baby for about an hour, baby got fussy so she passed him to my husband (dad), husband could not get baby to calm down do he passed baby to me and left to make a bottle. My mom walked over to me and asked if she could feed baby, I said yes, and passed baby to her. His brother said that sounded more accurate. Her mom (mils mom) called us asking the same thing using the same words. 

Instead of confronting MIL we just decided to go Low contact for a bit as I didn't even know what to say to her. A few days later I got a ""follow request,"" on Instagram from an account called ""shunned-mil,"" the account had also sent me some very hateful messages. I was unsure who's it was at first but then saw a photo of MILs dog with her home in the background which told me exactly who it was. I showed husband who wanted to call and yell at her and I told him to not worry about it. Per his request I blocked that account as well as her normal Instagram account that already followed me. 

She would randomly text us stuff from time to time but husband and I would just not respond or give one word responses. After a few months of this it stopped all together. 

At the start of this year my husband's grandfather (FILs dad) died. That same day mil called husband and left a VM saying ""someone better be dead or gravely ill for you to not be answering my phone calls!"" He texted her saying his grandfather died and she said she was sorry and she loved his grandfather but she wanted her answers still. 

The next day he called her and told her everything. He told her that he did not like that she constantly ignored what we asked when it came to our child (no vaping/limited walking/not crap talking his dad). He didn't like that she lied about us to family (keeping son in box and limiting reading as well as the lie about my mom) she denied all of it and said it never happened. He said well ""brother and your mom said, xyz."" To which she replied ""well I didn't think I would have to tell them not to tell you what I said!"" He also talked with her about the Instagram account and she denied it saying that I was lying and trying to ruin the relationship she has with her son. He said he saw the account and the photo of her dog on it and she said ""what do you want me to say??? That I did it??? FINE I DID IT!!! ARE YOU HAPPY??"" She started hysterically crying and said she was also pissed I blocked her on insta which my husband reminded her was only because she had sent me harrasing messages from a fake Instagram, he said he had to get back to work and hung up. 

Since then she tried texting me asking what she had done wrong. I just wrote to her saying that we were both very hurt and needed time to heal from it. I told her we do love her but she cannot treat us that way as its not nice. That regardless of if she liked it or not that I was babys mom, not her so she did need to consider what we say as well. I again expressed we loved her a lot, and wanted to have active grandparents in our kids life, but we also needed to work on our relationship as DIL and MIL. All she texted back was a Bible verse. 

I am really unsure where to go from here but my husband wants nothing to do with her right now. He has a lot of unhealed child trauma from her as well and this stacking on it has not helped. 

I just wanted to know if we are being the asshole here, if all are the asshole, or if it's just a misunderstanding between all. ",1,1739925859.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

1issapt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1issapt,First Royal Caribbean cruise (first cruise ever!) on Enchantment of the Seas...a review!,"My husband and I went on our first ever cruise! Our long time family friends convinced us we should go with them for the wife's 50th birthday. We had a blast and we loved every minute of it. 
My husband and I are not hard to please. We have four kids under 12, we run a small homestead, we eat out maybe 3-5 times a year. We aren't rolling in the money either. We saved for the cruise after realizing we really needed to invest in ourselves as a couple and just reconnect. I'm so glad we did! This was our first vacation/ trip without our kids. 
Our cruise was Feb 6th-10th of 2025. We cruised to Cozumel, Mexico.
Our ship was Enchantment of the Seas. It's one of the older ships if I remember, and there's definitely wear. Some rusted railings and one iron railing on the outside was snapped. I wish I had taken a picture of it. Mineral build up on the facets in the public bathrooms, some broken toilet paper rolls, cracked leather furniture. Nothing major worrying though. Just normal stuff when you've got thousands of people coming and going. At the same time, everything was super clean and tidy. The staff were constantly cleaning the bathrooms, I saw them vacuuming almost everyday. 
Our stateroom staff were amazing. Our interior room was always spotless after they cleaned it. Noise wise, we didn't have any problems. Our area was quiet even though some doors had the ""drink package"" sign. People were cordial and nice for the most part. Our bathrooms gleamed and smelled nice! They checked in with us every morning and asked if we needed anything.
The food in the buffet was great, but the desserts were hit or miss unless you dined in My Fair Lady. The buffet food was consistently tasty, and those triangle hash browns are like crack. Every meal I ate, I needed to have those hash browns! I craved them as soon as I woke up in the morning. The coffee and drink options were to be expected. Juices were good, kind of weak tasting but not awful. I'm not a coffee snob, but it was a little on the acidic side for me, but my spouse loves strong and dark coffee so he loved it. 
We had dinner reservations at My Fair Lady and the service was amazing. The waiters were great, attentive to us and friendly. 
Activities were enjoyable. I loved doing trivia in Schooners Bar and the nightly shows in the auditorium. The singers and dancers are so talented! We loved the shows.
Hanging out and playing cards in the Solarium was a favorite activity of ours. It was much quieter in there and the small cafe was nice to have for snacks and drinks. We did some of the free activities, but for the most part just enjoyed hanging out with friends and exploring the ship. Drinking and lounging around. Cozumel was amazing. My passport didn't come in time, and all I needed was my birth certificate and ID and Sea Pass. Easy process. We went to a resort all day, food was great. Drinks were delicious. Service was amazing. I got scolded by a lifeguard for being on the wrong side of the ropes though lol. 
All in all? I give our first ever cruise experience a 10/10. Buffet food was great. Desserts were hit or miss. Activities were fun. You only have to be as busy or laid back as you want to be. Staff were great. Definitely give it a try if you want a fun trip and don't let people push you off Enchantment of the Seas just because it's an older ship. Our whole cruise (minus the alcohol we got and other minor expenses) was under $800. That's significantly less than what we paid for a family vacation to Gatlinburg, TN. Will definitely go again as a couple, and take our kids when our youngest is a bit older. ",4,1739925734.0,royalcaribbean,0,1.0,False

I’m not gonna lie, this is a little upsetting. I was just using the app this morning and all of my goals were laid out in nice color-coded sections. Now I open the app and my goals are completely out of order. 

I wonder if it’s because I was trying a free 7-day trial of the premium subscription? I was on day 2 or 3 of the 7 day trial when this happened, so for now I’m canceling my subscription until everything is settled so it doesn’t charge me for the year. But I’m assuming it placed me in the new users group and switched me over to the self-care areas.

Is it really that uncommon to experience no nausea in the first trimester?

Dave just fucking exploded. Like a human water balloon filled with warm soup. My ears are ringing, my head is spinning, and my shoes—oh god, my shoes—are covered in what used to be Dave. A sticky, crimson sludge coats my pants up to the knees, clinging to the fabric in a way that tells me this shit is never coming out.

The break room smells like copper and bile. I think I might throw up. My stomach lurches and a sour burn runs up my throat like acid mixed with the afterburn of gas station coffee.

My brain is stuck in a feedback loop, trying to process what just happened, but there’s no rational pathway to follow. One second, Dave was standing there, sweaty and scared. The next, *boom*—he’s repainting the walls with his insides.

I stumble back, nearly slipping on a chunk of something that I absolutely refuse to identify, and slap my hand against the wall to steady myself. My heart is jackhammering against my ribs, my breathing fast and shallow.

I shove my phone into my pocket—because for some goddamn reason, I still have it in my hand, like checking the news is going to help me make sense of any of this—and force my legs to move. One slow, careful step. Then another.

Side-stepping around the meaty puddle formerly known as Dave, I push open the break room door and power-walk straight toward the employee bathroom at the back of the store.

“Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck…!” I mutter under my breath, feeling the residual warmth of Dave’s bodily fluids soaking through my pants. My hands are shaking, my pulse a wild, unsteady thing in my throat.

I have no idea what the hell is happening.

All I know is that Dave exploded, and I’m pretty sure I might be next.

I slam the bathroom door shut behind me, twisting the lock with hands that won’t stop shaking. The tiny, single-use restroom is as unremarkable as ever—stained linoleum, fluorescent lighting that buzzes faintly, the faint scent of industrial cleaner. For once, the dull familiarity is almost comforting.

Almost.

My reflection in the bathroom mirror greets me. Blue eyes looking slightly sunken, short dark hair wild, and a spray of red right across my face. *I look crazy*, I ironically think as I might actually be losing my mind.

I stagger to the sink and crank the faucet. Cold water rushes out, and I splash it onto my face, scrubbing at the sticky specks of blood clinging to my skin. The water turns pink in the basin, swirling down the drain as I grab a handful of paper towels and scrub at my cheeks. My reflection stares back at me, pale and wide-eyed, lips pressed into a thin line. “Okay, slightly *less* crazy looking,” I mumble.

Deep breath in. Deep breath out. Get it together, Joe.

Then I feel it—a pulsing in my mind, soft and rhythmic, like a cell phone notification buzzing on vibrate.

I freeze, my hands still gripping the edge of the sink. The sensation is . . . wrong. Like something foreign, something that shouldn’t be there.

No. No, no, no. That was just a dream. The whole thing—the System, the asshole with the snakes, the weird tutorial bullshit. It wasn’t real. *It can’t be real*. I squeeze my eyes shut, trying to will away the feeling and the memories. Then, as though in response, the pulse echoes in my mind.

Cautiously, heart pounding, I focus on the sensation. It feels . . . responsive? Expectant. Like it’s waiting for me to respond.

I open my eyes. My mouth is dry. My hands tremble as I take a step back from the sink, suddenly afraid of my own reflection.

“. . . System?” I whisper, half-expecting nothing to happen.

A softly glowing, translucent screen flickers into existence inches from my face.

*Oh*.

*Oh, fuck*.

My breath catches as words begin appearing on the screen, typed out in real time.

**WELCOME TO THE GOD GAME, PARTICIPANT.**

**STAGE ONE: TUTORIAL - CLASS SELECTION**

**\[In the First Stage of the God Game, Participants will participate in Quests in order to familiarize themselves with the finer mechanics of the System while growing in strength in preparation for the later Stages of the Game.\]**

**OBJECTIVES OF STAGE ONE:**

* **Obtain the necessary requirements to unlock a Class.**
* **Select a Class.**

**CONSEQUENCES FOR FAILING TO COMPLETE OBJECTIVES:**

* **Elimination from the God Game.**
* **All access to the System will be locked until the conclusion of the Game.**

**TIME REMAINING IN STAGE ONE: 364 Days, 14 Hours, 32 Minutes.**

**Thank you for participating in this Cycle’s Game. May Creation watch over all Participants and bring them success!**

My mouth goes dry. I swallow hard, but the lump in my throat doesn’t go away.

The screen vanishes.

I stand there, my reflection staring back at me in the mirror, my brain frantically trying to shove this whole thing into a nice, logical box where it makes sense.

It doesn’t.

Dave exploded.

The System is real.

And I’m in a game I never signed up for.

“Oh, fuck.” The words that escape my lips are ones of resignation. My dad has another says: You can’t always change everything. Sometimes you’ve just got to roll up your sleeves and work with what’s in front of you. My mind was scrambling to come to grips with what was currently in front of it.

The thoughts are only interrupted by another pulse in my mind, another notification screen snapping into existence before me.

**New Quest!**

**Gate Initiation.**

**\[Description: Participant must locate and enter a Gate, successfully clearing the Dungeon within.\]**

**\[Note: This Quest is available for a limited time only. The time limit will be randomly determined per Participant.\]**

**\[Consequences: Failure to complete this Quest within the Quest’s time limit will result in Elimination of the Participant.\]**

**\[Elimination Type: Culling.\]**

**\[Rewards: Access to additional menu options.\]**

**Continue?**

My breath catches in my throat.

My eyes lock onto three words.

**Elimination Type: Culling.**

A cold, terrible feeling claws at my gut.

I think of the news headlines. Of Dave. Of the way his face twisted in panic, the way he *knew* something was happening to him, the way he barely had time to say a damn thing before he exploded. What did he say again? *I’m running out of time, and I don’t know what to do*.

Elimination. Culling.

A partial picture begins to form in my mind, and I don’t like it one bit.

“Damn it.”

**Continue?** The neat font blinks at the bottom of the interface floating before me.

“Sure,” I mutter.

Another pulse, and the screen shifts again.

**Quest: Gate Initiation. Time Limit: . . .**

Three new headers appear beneath the message: **Days. Hours. Minutes.**

A line of nine reels appear on the interface. Below each word are three digital reels each displaying the number ‘0’, like a goddamned slot machine.

This can’t be serious. This *has* to be a joke. Or whichever Gods were in charge of this Game had a sick sense of humor. I thought of the smiling man in his throne, watching me fumble my way through the assimilation process for the System. *Yeah, that makes sense*.

The word appears again, prompting me: **Continue?**

My heart is hammering now, blood rushing in my ears. I try to focus, but panic is creeping in, clawing up my throat. If I’m right—if those numbers range anywhere from 0 to 9—then someone, somewhere, has already been fucked. I think of the headlines on my phone. Of Dave. No, some unlucky bastards already got royally screwed. That’s what had happened all across he globe. Hundreds of thousands of innocent people were looped into whatever kind of game this was and presented with the same Quest I was. They got minutes, maybe even *seconds*, to figure all this out before they were blown to pieces.

I picture some poor soul staring at their screen, too frozen to react, while the countdown hit zero. And then—

*Pop*.

I gag, forcing the thought out of my head.

I don’t have time for this.

I grit my teeth and square my shoulders. It’s too late to be scared. Too late to hesitate. I need to work with what’s in front of me.

I take a deep breath, steadying myself, and command the System to continue. This time the System interface reacts immediately to my thoughts.

All nine panels begin to spin rapidly. And I pray to whatever sick, twisted god is running this Game that I don’t get a zero across the board.

The first number under **Days** stops: Zero.

The other panels continue to spin.

The second number: Zero.

Panic swells in my chest. I watch, breath held, as the second reel under the word **Days** slows. It clunks into place.

Zero.

“Shit. No, no, no—” I squeeze my eyes shut for half a second, praying to whatever might be listening that the third reel lands on anything but zero. I’m not much of a gambler, and after the feeling of dread and anxiety coursing through my veins right now, I never will be.

It stops.

Zero.

The bottom drops out of my stomach. I have no days. None.

I barely have time to process that horrifying fact before the first reel under **Hours** lands on zero almost immediately.

The second number ticks into place: **2**.

Then, the third: **3**.

I’m numb, and just taking in the visual information feedback. Something beneath the surface might rise to the level of relief but I’m still stunned by the first four zeroes.

The **Minutes** reels spin for another few seconds before settling on zero, 1, and 4.

I stare in mute horror as the numbers finalize and the screen lights up with a small burst of fanfare.

The reel disappears from the vision, the interface replacing it with a new message accompanied by that increasingly familiar pulse sensation in my mind.

**Quest Update!**

**Quest: Gate Initiation.**

**\[Time Limit for completion of Quest updated to 23 hours, 14 minutes.\]**

I blink and the message is gone, replaced by an updated description of the Quest.

**CURRENT QUESTS:**

1. **Gate Initiation.**

**\[Description: Participant must locate and enter a Gate, successfully clearing the Dungeon within.\]**

**\[Note: This Quest is available for a limited time only.\]**

**\[Time Limit: 23 hours, 14 minutes\]**

**\[Time Remaining: 23 hours, 13 minutes\]**

**\[Consequences: Failure to complete this Quest within the Quest’s time limit will result in Elimination of the Participant.\]**

**\[Elimination Type: Culling.\]**

**\[Rewards: Access to additional menu options.\]**

Just under a single day.

A day to find a Gate. A day to complete the Quest.

Or I end up like Dave.

1iss58r,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1iss58r/please_help_me_troubleshoot_electrolytes_cramps/,Please help me troubleshoot electrolytes / cramps issue [*all details provided*],"Male 27, 187cm (6'1), 73kg (161lbs), I've started keto one month ago, with a fairly standard transition. At the beginning I felt ravenous and very weak, and I dealt with it by drinking more water, snaking on cheese/butter and upping my salt intake. After 2-3 weeks I felt like I had stabilized (though still weaker than pre-keto).

However around a week ago I started getting leg cramps for the first time, especially at the calves. I have had this type of cramps before only after drinking a lot of alcohol (which I haven't done in several months). I hadn't tracked electrolytes accurately until then, but I still know for sure that I never went under 6000mg of sodium, 1000mg of potassium, and 500mg of magnesium per day. The sodium mainly came from table salt and food, the potassium exclusively from food, and the magnesium from food plus 200-400mg of a bisglycinate supplement. Reading around I thought the issue was low potassium, so I started to ramp it up. However, three days ago I had to conclude that the issue wasn't potassium, because that day I had reached a total of:

* Sodium: 7900mg
* Potassium: 6400mg
* Magnesium: 1100mg

and still had cramps and weak legs. Half of that potassium came from food, the other half from Lite Salt in water throughout the day. From this I also concluded that sodium wasn't the issue, because with all that Lite Salt I was taking for potassium, I had also reached a whopping 8g of sodium.

So I thought the issue was low magnesium, since I had read here that some people feel good with very high doses. So the next day I tried to increase that (using the bisglycinate supplement):

* Sodium: 6100mg
* Potassium: 4000mg
* Magnesium: 1400mg

But nothing changed, still cramps and weak legs. So today I tried to increase magnesium even more:

* Sodium: 5400mg
* Potassium: 4400mg
* Magnesium: 1600mg

But again, nothing changed.

The cramps aren't that bad, and actually rarely trigger, but I know that training in this state would be impossible. And I would really like to start training again, because I have almost completely stopped since when I started keto. To give you an idea of how weak my legs are: before keto I could hold a horse stance for 2 minutes, but now I can't go past 45 seconds.

I have found threads where people claim that getting too much electrolytes can give you cramps. But my cramps started when I was just taking my usual 200-400mg magnesium supplement and a bit more salt on top of food, so I don't think this is the explanation.

At this point I am really at a loss and I don't know what to do. I feel like I tried everything and I don't know how to further troubleshoot. I thought about getting blood work, but I've read that serum electrolyte concentrations don't mean much. Any help is appreaciated! Thanks in advance!

\--- Some more, maybe useful info ---

I eat around maintenance at 2300kcal, with:

* Fat: 72.1%
* Protein: 24.4 %
* Net carbs: 3.5%

I mostly eat meat / fish and vegetables. I also eat some whey protein, nuts, seeds and cheese. I cook with lard and butter, and season with olive oil. The only processed food I eat are cold cuts, and I do use stevia / erythritol quite a bit (but I did so even pre-keto without issues). Apart from water I only drink 2-3 decaf coffees a day. I drink between 2 and 2.5l of water a day. If I drink more I tend to wake up at night to pee, even if I drink most of it in the first part of the day. So I avoid drinking more than 2.5l, because if I wake up I can rarely fall back alseep. I think I am hydrated enough because my pee is always a very pale yellow (only in the morning after waking up it's a bit darker). When starting keto I would pee more often than normal, but now I would say the frequency is the same as pre-keto. I am only lightly active and most days I don't sweat at all.

I(18F) meet this guy in December in my best friends family restaurant. He is my best friends A(18F) boyfriend's best friend. When I first saw him I was intrigued by his look and we talked a little bit that they and I wanted to get to know him a little better. After a few days A's boyfriend O(17M) and him came to that restaurant but we didn't talk that much. After that O asked him if he would like to be with me and he said no which I accepted. 
We continued hanging out at the restaurant sometimes even alone and I would notice he would start opening up to me about his problems and stuff or that he would say after 23h(he has a practice driving license)just to talk to me. Sometimes I would see him looking at me even when we were talking to other people but I just thought it was just my delusions. 
On Valentine's day I asked him if he would like to grab a coffee with me on Sunday, 16th February, he said he would call me if he had time and then on Friday he texts me that he doesn't really like crowded places and if I would like to good for a ride with him in his car. I said yes and he told me he would pick me up at around half 8.
He came and I got in the car, he got me a energy drink and we started going out of town. He started asking me questions like do I have a boyfriend or maybe a crush and would I like to have a boyfriend. After about 2.5 hours of riding he stopped the car on some parking and he turned off the car and started the conversation about me having a boyfriend again.He treated me like a passenger princess the whole time btw.After that he drove me to A's house where her and O were hanging out. We asked O to ask him how the ""date"" went and he said there were moments where he wanted to kiss me and then I thought that meant he likes me.
My friend called me a few hours ago asking weird questions like how do you know he likes you, what if he doesn't , what if me changed his mind, what if he rejects you and similar questions. I know she talks to him on IG so I thought he might of told her something so I got scared and wanted to ask someone on their opinion of the whole situation.

My (26F) boyfriend (31M) was fired about four months ago and has fallen into quite the depression. I know he feels deeply guilty about losing his job, and I'm trying to be supportive, but it's like all the ""bad habits"" he had before have multiplied and I'm starting to feel frustrated and hopeless. We have been together for about 2 years total. 

The major issue is his sleep schedule. He plays video games and smokes from roughly 9PM until 9AM, passes out until 5PM or so, smokes and eats and puts around, and then starts the cycle all over again. He claims this is the sleep schedule that suits him best and allows him to truly rest, decompress, and heal (for additional context: he has chronic back pain), but it doesn't seem to be helping him do anything productive (he wants to start his own company), we don't really spend much quality time together anymore, and he frequently wakes me up in the middle of the night because he's unintentionally loud while cooking or opening and shutting the door to our porch.

I tried to have a gentle conversation with him about it and explain why I was concerned (and the fact that my quality of sleep was suffering), and he got very upset. The sleep thing, to me, is a symptom of the larger issue: depression. He told me I ""just can't handle how he is"" and that I'm being selfish and controlling and causing him stress by asking him to change how he sleeps. I have no desire to control him or stress him out, obviously, I just want him to be healthy and happy. I also don't care that we sleep/wake at the same time, we've rarely done that, but that's the message he got from me expressing my concern: that I want us to be on the same schedule or I'll be unhappy. I wasn't able to clarify my feelings because he essentially stopped listening.

This whole thing prompted me to do a ton of research about different styles of sleep and sleep cycles, but I also want to ask here for general advice. Beyond asking him how I can support him, I've tried everything I can think of to be mentally and emotionally supportive as he goes through this tough time. I miss when he was well and working and I'd drive him to the airport for his work trips and make him a coffee or smoothie in the morning. I miss our evening chats. I miss laughing together. I miss our relationship. It feels like we're living two separate lives and I don't know how to stop the separation from growing and growing.

I'll be honest, our communication has gotten worse and worse since we started living together. I've had a really hard time getting him to help around the house and I've tried to take it easy on him because of his chronic pain but it's been a tough year. As soon as I moved in with him he started criticizing me for my cleaning habits despite not doing much cleaning himself, and it's left me with a lot of lingering sadness. I love my boyfriend so much, and I didn't see very much of this side of him before we started living together.

Is there some way to encourage him to get into therapy? How can I help him get out of this rut?

1isrxq3,https://i.redd.it/ovchjaclpzje1.png,My Ingredient tier list,"This was made for fun and is just my opinion so take it with a grain of salt. I ranked the ingredients in Pokémon sleep based on how useful I think they are right now in late game recipes.

S Tier
Rousing Coffee: Used in all 4 of the highest strength dishes as well as some others so it seems like the only ingredient worthy of S

A Tier
Greengrass Corn: Used in all 3 recipe types and used in some of the most efficient recipes such as Calm Mind Salad, Scones, and Keema Curry 

Warming Ginger: Used in very important dishes like Keema Curry, Scones, Zingzap Cola, and even a few niche salads

Fancy Apple: Before the newest recipes came out apples were basically required for desserts. They aren't used in any good curries but they are used in Calm Mind salad which is also quite good.

Honey: Was already used in all 3 recipe types and got a big buff for being included in Eclairs

B Tier
Bean Sausage: Some people might not like them, but they are a part of Defiant Coffee Salad as well as Keema Curry, so they would be difficult to skip over

Milk: Really only useful for desserts, but Milk is similar to apples in terms of how useful it is for desserts. Also got a big buff by being included in Eclairs

Soft Potato: Important for Defiant Coffee as well as Greengrass Salad, and can also see use in some Curries

Pure Oil: Not used in any desserts or curries, but Oil is important for Defiant Coffee Salad and Greengrass Salad

Snoozy Tomato: Not used in any Desserts but is used in Hidden Power Curry, as well as some salads

Greengrass Soybeans: Really only useful for Hidden Power Curry in my opinion as I don't like the Ninja dishes much

C Tier
Fiery Herbs: While not used in too many dishes it is the main part of Keema curry, which is the most efficient dish in the game. I think once some new Herb dishes come out Herbs will be very powerful

Tasty Mushroom: These are needed for Hidden Power Curry, the Ninja dishes, and maybe a few others, but the production rate of mushrooms makes them feel very bad to farm

Large Leek: Fairly similar to mushrooms. Leeks are in Zingzap Cola and the Ninja dishes, but don't feel good to farm. 

Soothing Cacao: I would have confidently placed this in F tier but Cacao got a huge buff when it was included in Eclairs. I don't think Macarons are very good and should generally be avoided

D Tier
Slowpoke Tail: Even though I wouldn't consider them to be very good, I like the place that they have in the game. You don't really need them for any recipes but you also don't feel bad getting them from ingredient magnet because they can add a nice boost to the score of a dish.

F Tier 
Fancy Egg: in addition to being difficult to farm, eggs are also currently not used in any dish that I would want to make. The dishes they show up in have low efficiency

New Dad here! Well, this is our second, so sort of new dad :)

Our baby was born on the 12th, and it's been super interesting taking this medication and having a newborn. I'll go into a bit of detail...

TLDR; Tirzepatide has been amazing. New dad fuel!

OK ... the details.

I started Tirzepatide on 1/18. I took my fifth 2.5mg shot just 3 days after our baby girl was born. Before I get into how it's been post-shot and a newborn, here's my experience with Tirzepatide so far.

* I started at 205, and I'm down to 188. Yay!
* The appetite suppression is real! I'm perfectly good at 2.5mg and may or may not titrate up later. 
* Tirzepatide gave me more energy. I get up faster in the mornings. Sadly, still I don't want any coffee... I used to love a cup in the morning.  
* My biggest challenge has been nausea. Out of the four shots I did before my baby, I threw up twice on those nights. (My diet is great, I eat really clean, I inject in the thigh, and yes... I've sniffed the 91% isopropyl alcohol wipes and it does help!) Still, nausea is just a thing for me.

OK.... now, how does this all apply to a newborn?

* The appetite suppression is still there. I still can't eat a lot in a sitting. But, I've found myself to be MUCH hungrier than before! At first, I thought it was the medication wearing off. But then I realized that I'm moving WAY more than before on about 3-4 hours of sporadic sleep. I've been trying to put more good calories in me that fill me up.
* You guys ... the energy thing is UNREAL with a newborn. Don't get me wrong, I still get tired, but my ability to just get up at 2am or 3 am, or 5 am, run downstairs, get some milk ready, change a diaper, is insane. Our oldest girl is almost 7 and it was NOT like this. I was a zombie in the first few weeks. This experience has been really different. And I still don't want coffee!
* Now for the nausea. I was SO scared that I'd be sick while my wife had to care for a newborn... I took a Zofran when I took the shot and OMG... No nausea. It was amazing. I might make this a thing from now on!

OK, this is all that my tired brain could muster at the moment. I'm definitely staying the course, continuing tirzepatide, and doing my very best to stick to a good diet.

My first time ordering I got a small annihilator and it was amazing! Next time, I got it in a medium and it wasn’t as good or flavorful. Does Dutch use the same amount of shots and flavoring for all sizes? As in, should I be asking to add a shot or extra sweet when I size up on drinks? Or do you think it was just a fluke that my medium didn’t taste as good?

Another question is I’m seeing that the yummy drink recommendations I see on here and TikTok often aren’t available on the app. (As of now I have to order ahead on the app because with my location being a new open- the lines are longgggg.) Is it best to do create your own coffee, or to find similar drinks in the app and add/ modify flavors? Or does that mean up the ratios! For example- I want to try the iced white angel.

1isrujq,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_the_Bulletin/comments/1isrujq/the_mvp_my_thoughts_on_an_early_launch_evan/,The MVP & My Thoughts on an Early Launch - Evan,"First of all, if you're reading this welcome to the Bulletin blog. My name is Evan and I'm co-founder of this little venture. The idea of these posts are to act as a documentation of our process, to bring people along for the ride. I am a firm believer of the idea that a product, in it's best form, is one that is free to the customer and is entirely shaped by them. That is the hope with this Reddit page, to get our audience involved. 

  
**The Idea**

This idea was one that I had a while ago. I've always tried to stay informed on so much around me, things related to my work, local events, local news, national politics, the latest trends in health and fitness, personal finances and investing, etc. At the same time, I keep extremely busy with work, health and fitness, social events, volunteering, and school. I've just realized that though both of those things in my life should exist, I typically need to sacrifice my activities for the sake of reading more news or researching my industry or visa versa. Because of that I've always thought the idea of eliminating the noise was interesting. What if I could only get information that is relevant to me? Even better, what if I could cut that information down into a quickly digestible format so I'm up to speed?

This is how the Bulletin came along. 

  
**Getting Started**

I met Diego working for a company just after college. We both worked for the same team and after we both left the company to move to new roles, we stayed connected. We re-connected more intentionally some time after starting our new roles over coffee and had great conversations about ideas we've had, talked through our careers, etc. From then on, we made it a point to try and connect every month or so over a drink or on the phone. After one night grabbing a few beers and just throwing around some big ideas, we figured if there's any time to start trying to build something it's now. We began meeting on a recurring basis just to talk through ideas, maybe some were good, maybe some were bad, but really this was just intended to get the ball rolling on something. 

Diego and I both had a ton of ideas. I think the best thing to do is just start talking through anything and everything. Once you get someone else's opinion the idea takes on a life of it's own rather than just sitting in the notes app of your phone. That's where we started to get into the idea of the Bulletin (at the time we didn't have a name). At a certain point this became and idea we actually thought we could build and develop right now and we both knew it was something we would use ourselves.

That's pretty important (at least it should be) that the product you build is one you'd use personally. Otherwise, why would anyone else care?

So we locked in on this idea and started to just start.

  
**First Steps**

I am one who pretty consistently falls victim to the paralysis by analysis process where I start to think too big and that big thought now becomes overwhelming to the point that I no longer think it's feasible. Like taking an idea like this and starting to add everything to the idea that ever needs to exist for all time and then trying to figure out how to build all of that at once. That doesn't work. For example, if you want to build something like a newsletter like this, you need to build the newsletter, in this case have it be AI generated, figure out how to build a website, figure out how to get user's data to generate the newsletter, store that data, write the emails, build the emails, send them, advertise for revenue, store heaps of data, figure out a marketing plan, figure out social media marketing, etc. All of that becomes very quickly impossible. 

The reason Diego and I finally got started though is the idea of just - starting. We both just decided we should begin on one thing and start to figure out the rest later. 

I studied computer science in school but haven't touched that in years since so I definitely would not consider myself an engineer. Coding is daunting, the thought of building something using AI was so abstract to me, but just getting started changed all of that. I think we all underestimate how much we're capable of just figuring out. I mean, I think it's somewhat of a natural instinct. Just think about how mammals are born and just kind of naturally pick up queues from their surroundings so they can survive. That's a basic instinct. So why wouldn't that apply to things like work or building an idea? 

So now I've been playing with custom GPTs, trying to figure out how this thing interprets directions, how it stores any memory and how it improves itself. None of this makes sense to me but I'm somehow starting to get a basic understanding of how to manipulate the thing. We've been able to build a nice email format, something that at least looks professional, we've got a website (although neither of us are web designers so this is a work in progress), we've got the email list started, and we've got some outputs that we're generating that are honestly pretty good for an early draft. We've got so many of the parts built today that we didn't have any clue how to do before. The internet is a prety incredible resource. That brings us to today.

  
**Today**

By today I just mean where we're at now. We pulled together a list of 50 friends and family to start getting this in front of people, collect feedback, and allow us to make it better. I saw a quote recently that I really enjoyed:

  
""If you are not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you've launched too late."" - Reid Hoffman *(Cofounder of Linkedin)*

  
I think this idea is where Diego and I agreed the most, just getting a variety of topics, seeing how people want to use something, what they want out of it, what works and doesn't work is so important. 

This is honestly where the output started to take on a life of its own. We're seeing how the agent react to different levels of detail from the inputs. This is major, some people took the product as a 'self-help' kind of thing, some as a news source, some as a support system, and so forth. This is where we're now struggling to some extent. It is incredible to see how a user wants to use the product but to some extent we do need to figure what is the desired product and how do we influence the users to provide input that reaches that outcome. It would be great to be the source for all things Evan in self help, career advice, health and wellness, and the current politics in California, but at a certain point we're now spread a mile wide and an inch deep. This feels to me like a very critical turning point in the early days of the product. 

From here then the questions are now - how do we market this as a news platform? or How do we pivot to a self-help column? Do we like either of those options or should we find a third option? If it's news, do we want to focus on a few small subsets related to the user like geo, job, industry, life stage, or do we want the user to have full control of the topics? 

And that's kind of where we sit today. 

  
We're so far from a true launch but at the same time things are developing relatively fast. trying to be agile and get the most out of our current ability to have a test group of customers via friends and family is crucial. We'll keep on posting here to document our journey.

Yet some people join a business, purchase products they personally use, and then act like they were robbed. If you bought something and used it, you got value—you didn’t “lose” anything.

Let’s be real: The only way you “lose” money in business is if you refuse to do the work and blame the opportunity instead of yourself.",2,1739924393.0,AmwayNorthAmerica,0,1.0,False

My first attempt never carbonated in secondary fermentation.

My second attempt I caught a raging flu and let it go for far too long and went moldy.

Hello, I was in a relationship of one year and 3 months since the beginning we had problems because I got pregnant during the first month, it was so hard at the beginning I didn’t wanted to have an abortion I beg him not to do it, but I felt trap so we did had an abortion I tried to don’t stay with him, but we kept trying things happens our relationship wasn’t that good because the abortion brought problems to the relationship, he tried to be nice to me sometimes but could never forget about it, I didn’t get along with his family, and we barely spent time together because he was traveling for work all time so that was another fact that made us broke up, we ended up really bad…

So I made a account on tinder and he saw me on the app he talk to me and said. Hello I hope you’re doing well and I answered him I was good the thing is this happened after 3 months no contact he says through text if I would like to go our for a coffee, I asked maybe, for what you want to see me he said don’t you want to see me so I said ok let’s meet. The day are arrived I entered to the coffee shop and he was with a really bad attitude and face like he didn’t wanted to see me in the face but it was so weird why would you reach me out on tinder and invited me to go out if you don’t even want to see me, the thing is he says how are you I said I’m good and you then he said… Oh I’m not here to asked you to come back with me… That destroyed me inside I couldn’t talk in my voice you could hear my broke voice I was about to cry but I hold it up I said let’s go outside we went outside of the coffee shop and we just start fighting at the end I said why would you want to rich out to me if you don’t want to get together and you talk to me on tinder he said I just wanted to know how you were doing, like let’s be honest he was playing me I still can’t get over all this all I wanted was to get marry and in the future have kids but it wasn’t he’s plan I’m still brokenhearted it was a lot of abused he said that we never planned nothing like I can’t still forget about everything he said to hurt me.

So hopefully this is more explanatory! Sorry for the rambles.



I’m F22 in my senior year of college. I’m a computer science major. On Monday I had an exam, the first exam in the class. I was super ready for it, or at least I felt ready. I went to every review session, had review sessions of my own, and studied extensively the night before and the morning of. On the practice exam I got most of the questions right.

I’m really bad at taking tests as in it either goes well or I completely tank. So keep that in mind.

Anyways, the morning of I was studying in the campus coffee place. I got a call from my sister F19, asking if she can talk to me. I thought this was weird bc we are close but messaging me at 7 am to talk wasn’t something we did. Anyways, over the phone she was freaking tf out and saying that mom told her stuff last night and she couldn’t sleep at all.

I helped her calm down but I didn’t know what was going on so it was pretty hard for me to.

I asked my mom what was going on and she told me that when she went for her mammogram they found a 2.7 cm mass on her breast and they needed to do further testing. Humor/being suspiciously chill is my way of coping with this stuff strangely enough considering I freak tf out when I’m stressing about anything related to me, but I did a similar thing where I assumed the older sister role when my sister was super distraught when my great grandma got dementia. Basically just being the rock.

Anyways, this all unfolded like an hour before the exam.

I go into the exam feeling prepared and I absolutely fumble it. Like completely. I realize she did not shorten it AT ALL from the practice exam, and the open ended coding questions on homework’s usually take me upwards of an hour to do just two questions. On here there were 10. So I knew I was screwed. I thought I got at least a good portion of the multiple choice right but I’ll be totally honest, the combo of the dread from the exam as well as whatever tf is going on with my family kind of imploded and I mostly just sat there like a robot that got deactivated in the middle of a game. Also didn’t help that she is not at all fluent in English and the questions didn’t make sense to my idiot brain.

Eventually I realize me sitting there staring isn’t doing anything, so I try to put something down. My hand is shaking so it probably looks like someone with carpal tunnel is trying to write a novel, but I tried. I wrote at least something down for each question but it was nowhere near enough. 

I turned it in anyways, because I told myself in a failed effort to calm down that since it’s the first exam she’ll probably be more lenient since we don’t know how she grades. No. Not at all.

She gave me a 50 percent. Which freaked me the fuck out bc idk what im even doing at this point. She graded it that night at 10 pm so I mostly cried but also freaked tf out to my closes confidant. Bless his soul but my bf is the most emotionally stunted yet pure hearted man I have ever seen because he did not help at all. In fact he mostly stared at me like the dead fish they show in those fishing pictures where they are devoid of all emotion. Because his approach is always ‘I will sit in silence because when I’m upset I don’t want to talk’ but I NEVER want that and he KNOWS that. 

I know it’ll get figured out and worst case I just have to go to every tutoring session until I get it right. Plus I have a case manager in the dean of students office so that’s helpful.

What I feel I may be overreacting about though isn’t that, but rather how my best friend/roommate has treated this evening. As I stated above, he has… issues, comforting people to say the least. And I get it, I shouldn’t expect a lot or anything from him. But he walked in when I was on the phone with my mom. He heard what happened. And instead of doing anything he just kind of pretended I didn’t exist? Like didn’t talk to me, would  OCCASIONALLY look over at me nervously and then go back to being on his computer, but didn’t actually initiate anything.

After like an hour and a half of this he had to go to practice and still didn’t say anything to me. I offhandedly said that his radar is astonishingly bad, to which he replied for what? And I told him his radar for sensing when people need comforted or asked if they’re okay. I wasn’t saying this in a mean way, just jokingly saying he’s bad at emotions. But I could see where maybe my annoyance with him not really caring to help me when everything blew up in my face could’ve been apparent. 

Anyways, he just shrugged, said yeah, and left. Which is fine that he left, he has practice, but I’m just kind of bummed that my one best friend didn’t really even try and help me at all. Especially since he knows how horrible my OCD is, SPECIFICALLY around health and the people I love.

Just to provide an example as to what I mean, I have horrible OCD revolving around me or anyone I care about getting hurt or dying, so much so that I have vivid dreams nearly every night about someone I care about suffering a brutal demise. This obviously is not fun, and since it’s been an issue since I was around 10 it’s altered my quality of life quite heavily. I see a therapist as of this year but since this has been over a decade in the making it’s gonna take time to fix.

When things like this happen, especially all at once, like the exam plus my mom, my brain likes to jump on it as an opportunity to drive me crazy. Which sounds exaggerated but it’s genuinely true, and not an experience I’d wish on anyone. I feel like I literally have a brain that hates me and works against me. It’s like if I was on a bad acid trip but ALL THE TIME. It’s horrible.

I of course convinced myself that the stuff with my mom was somehow my fault. That somehow me doing poorly on the exam led to my mom getting the news. Or that maybe I committed a sin of some sort that made me have to suffer to realize I did something wrong, and that to take the possible pain away from her I have to break the cycle by passing it onto me.

See how this sounds totally crazy? Like bonkers? Yeah, this is how it feels in my brain all the time. And so it does hurt and it does make me sad when my bf, who KNOWS what’s going on in my head, sees me suffering, just leaves me to it. I know he prefers to be alone when he’s upset, but we have been close for 4 years now and he knows I need someone to literally talk me off the ledge or I won’t realize how bad it’s gotten. So him leaving just felt like him giving up, and I know he didn’t intend it but then my brain convinced me I’m too much for him or he doesn’t want to deal with all this. And I know realistically I should deal with my own crap but this is literally my biggest fear (someone I love having something happen to them) and I don’t know how I am supposed to just go to class tomorrow like normal. 

Anyways, am I overreacting for hoping he would comfort me or help me out during this rough time instead of shutting down? To be fair when I told the friend group (cause they all love my mom) what happened, he sent a hug gif so I guess that was his attempt? Idk.

[https://cinematicdiversions.com/jason-bourne-2016-review/](https://cinematicdiversions.com/jason-bourne-2016-review/)

  
Jason Bourne (2016): 7 out of 10: The Jason Bourne story so far. Jason became a superspy after the death of his father, but it turns out his father wasn’t killed by a runaway sled named Rosebud. He was assassinated by his uncle, played by Tommy Lee Jones. Uncle Tommy then marries his mother played by Julia Stiles, which means that his mother is now both his sister and his aunt. So Jason starts therapy, but it goes sideways when it turns out that the therapist is both a double agent and a ghost. 

I am pretty sure that synopsis is fairly accurate. The movie starts with a decent action scene in what is both supposed to be and clearly is not Athens and ends with an impressive action scene in what is supposed to be and clearly is Las Vegas. 

Between these two tent poles I have a couple of issues besides the incomprehensible plot (see above). First, if you are going to put up a title card for Berlin, London, Athens or Las Vegas, you really don’t need to give us the country. Second, while the dynamic shaky cam is useful during dynamic chase scenes, though honestly I am not a fan, it needs to be turned off when characters are looking at their phone or just having coffee. Third, yelling the word enhance at a computer monitor will not turn a dozen blurry pixels into Julia Stiles. 

And last, what is it with modern movies showing our intelligence agencies murdering all their henchmen like some particularly demented James Bond villain? I noticed this silliness in Suicide Squad, of all things, but it is even sillier here. You just can’t go killing your own agent’s willy nilly. Workplaces don’t work like that. Everyone will call in sick if the boss is whacking their cube mates out of plot convenience.

The action bits make this watchable and the scenery is nice (except for that graffiti hellhole Berlin. Seriously, Germans, clean that up, will you? Nobody is impressed). The acting is decent and entertaining. Only real shame is the plot is such an incomprehensible, silly mess.

**Original Post - February 9th 2025**

I (31F) am at my wit's end with my husband's (32M) coworker Sarah (30F), and his complete inability to see what's happening. I'm not usually one for reddit, but I need to know if I'm going crazy here.

Where do I even start? Three years ago, my husband Mark started working with Sarah. At first, I tried to be welcoming. I invited her to our BBQs, included her in group outings, and genuinely tried to be friendly. Big mistake. She spent the entire time making backhanded comments about everything from my career (""Oh, you're just a yoga instructor? How... peaceful."") to my cooking (""I guess not everyone can master basic seasoning."").

The real problem is that Mark thinks she's ""just being funny."" Last month, she literally threw away the anniversary mug I gave him because it ""clashed with the office aesthetic."" When I got upset, Mark said I was being too sensitive and that ""Sarah just has high standards for office decor."" IT WAS A MUG WITH OUR WEDDING PHOTO ON IT.

Some greatest hits from Sarah: - She scheduled a ""mandatory"" work dinner on our anniversary - She convinced Mark not to take a promotion because it would mean working with a different team - She posts daily photos of them together with hashtags like #WorkPowerCouple and #WorkSpouse - She tells everyone at their office that she ""takes better care of him than I do"" - She changed his coffee order and now tells everyone she ""trained him right""

The worst part? My husband is completely blind to all of this. Yesterday, he actually told me about how Sarah said our new house (which we spent months searching for) was ""charming, in a starter home kind of way."" He repeated this while LAUGHING.

I tried talking to him about it, but Sarah has convinced him I'm ""just insecure."" She's managed to insert herself into every aspect of our lives. They text constantly - even on weekends. She knows his schedule better than I do. She rearranged his entire desk and office wardrobe because his style was ""too suburban husband."" THAT'S WHAT HE IS!

Last week, I suggested marriage counseling. He looked genuinely confused. He of course went and talked to Sarah about it I found out from another coworker that she's been telling people that Mark and I are ""going through a rough patch"" and that she's ""just being a good friend by giving him someone to talk to."" We weren't going through anything until she started this nonsense!

The breaking point? I stopped by his office to surprise him with lunch (I know, I know, but it was his birthday and Sarah was supposedly out sick). Guess who was there? Sarah. She'd ""miraculously recovered"" and bought him a cake that said ""To my work hubby"" with a photo of them from the office holiday party. She saw me and said, ""Oh, Amy! You came too... how nice. Mark, you didn't tell me your real wife was coming!""

I'm not crazy, right? This woman is trying to destroy my marriage while my husband stands there grinning like it's all some big joke. What do I do? Divorce seems extreme, but I'm running out of options here.

TL;DR: My husband's ""work wife"" is actively trying to sabotage our marriage while he remains completely oblivious to her obvious manipulation.

ETA: I should have stated that the promotion wasn't one that would increase his salary but his title. It would give him more leadership experience. It still blows my mind that he turned it down just so he could stay on the same team as her.

ETA: I should have told the mug story in its entirety. She ""accidentally"" broke the mug. I noticed it was gone when I was visiting him one day and I asked him about it. He said she accidentally knocked it over and then later he repeated a ""joke""she made about how it didn't fit the office aesthetic.

**Update - February 13th, 2025, 4 days later**

Hi! I (31 F) posted a few days ago. I really didn't expect my post to blow up the way it did. I got so overwhelmed by all the comments that I haven't responded to any. I want to address everyone who says it's fake - I understand why you think that, but this is my personal hell. I only listen to Reddit stories on TikTok, but when this reached its boiling point, I just needed a place to talk. So I made an account and tried to yell into the void. Well, the void turned out to be less empty than I thought!

Now, to why everyone is here - the update: Before I talked to my husband (32M), I decided to do some investigation. I started with his phone and read all the messages between him and Sarah. She bad-mouthed me a few times (he did nothing to defend me but didn't engage either). She was flirty; he wasn't really flirty back. They talked a lot, and he praised her frequently for her work ethic and intelligence. I didn't see anything about cheating. I checked his email - nothing. I checked his work email - nothing. I looked through our other devices - nothing. I searched high and low for a second phone - nothing. Everything I found was always dancing that line. Nothing was outright cheating, but here are the things I found that did hurt my feelings:

• He has lunch with her, and only her, every day in the office. They don't really like anyone else, so they'll criticize others and say, ""Let's talk more at lunch, they're serving xyz today.""

• He'd say things like ""I'm sure if you were a wife, you would xyz."" He always kept it as ""a wife"" and not ""my wife,"" but it still upset me.

• She admitted to breaking the mug on purpose. He didn't get upset with her, just said, ""Yeah, the photo gifts are kind of corny.""

I confronted him. I laid it all out, and while he wasn't upset, he did try to brush things off. He said I was being sensitive and overreacting. I told him if we didn't have a real conversation about this, I would file for divorce. That got his attention, and he sat down with me.

He admitted that at first, he found it odd that Sarah was trying so hard - he saw her trying hard with all the men in the office. The more attention she gave him, the more he enjoyed it, and the more he responded, the more attention she gave, until she just had her sights on him. He knew some of the other men were envious, and he liked that too. He admitted that eventually, he just got too deep. He said he knew it was wrong but had gotten addicted to the attention and didn't want her to move on to another man. So he indulged her sometimes at my expense. He said it was just nice to have two women in the two major parts of his life, stating that he knew we'd rarely see one another, so what was the harm? He reiterated that he never EVER physically cheated with her but admitted it could be called an emotional affair.

It was painful, I won't hide that. I mean REALLY painful - like I wasn't enough. I told him from this point on, he needed to stop communicating with Sarah and ask to be transferred or switch jobs altogether. Now folks, I mean it when I tell you this:

He. Lost. His. Shit.

He began raising his voice, saying things like he never cheated, it was all above board, and I couldn't control who he talked with at work. He called me a narcissist and a control freak. He told me I had no idea how hard it was, how much stress he had in the office, and that his personal relationship with Sarah helps a lot - taking it away would just damage his mental health. It got so bad that I started crying. I couldn't take it anymore and decided to leave. I packed a small bag and called my MIL - she's the only family I have here. I gave her a rundown of what was going on, and she offered her home to me. I'm staying here and just hoping my husband calms down so we can revisit this. I want to work it out; I love him more than anything.

I will try harder to answer comments on this post, and I will definitely update if something new happens. This has been really therapeutic and makes me feel less alone.

TLDR: I confronted my husband about his work wife, and he lost it on me. Now I'm staying with my MIL.

>*Welp, I kind of figured he wasn’t that clueless. This is a full blown emotional affair. From experience, things will only escalate they are in bed together. Protect your peace, because he sure doesn’t give a damn about your feelings. Stay strong.*

>*Jumped right from “admitted it could be called an emotional affair” to “he began raising his voice, saying things like he never cheated”.*

>*OP made a valiant effort, but it doesn’t seem like this marriage can be saved.*

 **Additional comments from OOP about her MIL**

My MIL is on my side and told me point blank that he is wrong. However, she said she doesn't want to get in the middle bc she doesn't want to damage the relationship with either one of us. She told me I'm welcome as long as I need but she won't bring anything up to her son until he brings it up to her.

My MIL agrees his actions are wrong but doesn't want things to escalate or to damage her relationship with either one of us so she is staying out of it unless he contacts her.

As for my husband he has tried to reach out. He's called left message texted. I let him know I was safe and left it at that. He will message or call every few hours but we haven't talked.

To all the people saying they're ""team Sarah"" and hoping Sarah and my husband get together – I even saw a nasty comment saying Sarah and my husband would be ""the office power couple"" – how can you sit here and say nothing's going on? You claim my husband didn't cheat and I'm being crazy, yet in the same breath wish they would get together? You're contradicting yourself because deep down you know something romantic was developing.

Now for the update.

My husband came to my MIL's house (she didn't call him). He knew I was there because I told him, and he said he wanted to talk. Some big things happened in such a short time.

He wanted to explain. According to my husband, after I left, he started to reflect, he did call his mom and they had a long talk (I didn't know any of this) She asked him if he was happy with me and he said yes but I made him extremely happy. I was a good wife and a great partner. This is kind of what it all sunk into him that he was being juvenile for wanting attention from another woman. I did ask him why he always brushed things off and never took action before. He said He couldn't explain it – it just felt good. He assured me he never wanted to sleep with her and never advanced things that way. It was just nice having someone around who was fawning over him, like a fan.

For those who said he didn't know what an emotional affair was and was just agreeing with me – you were right. He admitted he didn't really understand what an emotional affair was, but after looking it up, he agreed that's what it was, though unintentional. He said he didn't want to lose his friend, so he just went along with a lot of what she did. He admitted he was deep into a fog but me leaving And this conversation with his mom was the one thing that brought him out of it. He said he didn't want to fight. My husband is big on giving me my space so when I left he didn't chase after me because he thought it would be best for us to just cool down and think about this and hopefully come back and discuss it more rationally.

He did reach out to Sarah. Though they didn't meet in person, they had a phone call. He told her they couldn't remain as close, that their out-of-office texts and calls needed to stop, that he would get a replacement mug she wasn't to touch, and that they needed to cut back on their lunches. He wanted to handle this before talking to me, to show he was serious.

Sarah didn't take it well. She started berating me, saying I was forcing him to do this. My husband stopped her and said no – he was doing this because his marriage was important. He admitted letting things go too far but clarified he had no romantic interest in her. He told her if she had feelings for him, she needed to distance herself immediately.

Sarah ended up ruining their friendship herself. Though my husband was willing to maintain a more distant friendship, her comments about me and him, claiming she'd never want him and that everything she did was because she knew we weren't meant to be together, and she was trying to open his eyes. He said he couldn't believe he'd never seen how vindictive and awful she was – she was almost venomous. It didn't end well.

After handling that situation, he came to see me, wanting to ensure I knew he understood and was taking the proper steps. He said we could do whatever I needed.

I know some of you will say I'm wrong, that divorce is the only option because he had an emotional affair. I'm sorry to disappoint, but I'm not divorcing my husband. I told him we needed counseling for both of us. Yes, going through all his devices, emails, and texts might have been extreme – he agreed it felt like a breach of privacy but understood given the circumstances. I told him we both needed to work on things. As of right now, I guess you could say that we're separated. We're not staying in the same house. We're going to attend counseling. I don't want to just jump back into things with him. I don't want it to seem like it was okay to make me feel like I was the second option to ignore all those red flags and to brush me off. This has to be worked on. I'm leaving his mother's house and staying with a friend

I'm not sure if anyone's going to want an update after this. Sorry it's so anticlimactic sorry it's the typical. Oh you just got back together. I mean it is but it isn't. I love my husband. I know he loves me. I don't think everything is an end-all be-all yes, it's a terrible situation. Yes he did a terrible thing but I want my marriage to last so we're giving it another go.

I genuinely hope this is my last update, but if it's not, Y'all will know. Thank you for all the messages. All the support everything it really has been a huge help.

>*Glad to hear that the fog is lifting. I hope he sticks to his word and distances himself from Sarah. I would even involve HR to let them know what is going on in case she gets vindictive and tries to cause trouble at work. I'm happy to hear that you're proceeding cautiously; I hope everything goes well for you in the end.*

******THIRD UPDATE******

**[~~Update 3~~](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1isfxjo/my_husbands_ex_work_wife_has_started_a_smear/) - Feb 18th 2025, 4 days from previous update, but removed due to posting too many updates**

**Credit to u/throwRA1a2b3c4d1 for finding the deleted post**

Hi reddit, We are continuing our work wife saga. As a lot of you predicted in my last update, Sarah wasn’t happy about my husband ending their friendship and trying to put a distance between him and her. I seriously thought she was going to reach out to me but she never did why? Because this was never about me. I was not even on her radar except for somebody to tear down.

I will give Sarah one thing. She is extremely efficient. She started her campaign long before Monday morning. Over the weekend she reached out to several of my husband’s co-workers, (mostly male.) She told them that my husband had randomly stop being friends with her and she suspected it was my fault. She said she couldn’t believe it. Everyone knew how close they were. She just felt bad for him. Wanted to be a friend for him and hopefully he help him out of our terrible marriage. She went on and on about how she couldn’t believe how much this is going to affect her during her working hours that she didn’t know if she can continue working at this job. One of the female workers at my husband’s job messaged me all of this.

As a lot of you predicted, she is gearing up to accuse my husband of sexual harassment. Monday alone she has put herself In the path of my husband multiple times. It kind of feels like she’s setting up to do and he said she said argument because she’s doing a lot of odd things at least according to my husband. Think stuff like intentionally following my husband into a room or a section of the office that is somewhat closed off, accidentally emailing him or forwarding him things, going to his cubicle multiple times day for no reason, sitting close to him in meetings. It seems harmless but really it feels like she’s gearing up For something.

My husband did go to HR first thing Monday morning and like I kind of thought they pretty much said they can’t do anything unless it affects work or working hours. (His HR is not the greatest) He did let them know what she was doing today but honestly I don’t think they took him seriously.

We’ve been thinking about moving. The only thing that keeps us here is really his mom. So he might just transfer jobs? We’re not really sure. I hope things don’t escalate anymore and since he went to HR already, I’m hoping that nothing big happens.

I’d like to give a little update about our counseling. To all the people who tell me that I’m making a mistake by giving my husband another chance and trying to work it out. I am so happy I don’t listen to you. I understand it was a shitty situation. I lived through it. I know it is. I know how it felt.

But counseling has revealed a lot about my husband that I didn’t even know. Apparently he was bullied severely in high school and he kind of went through a little glow up when he went into college. Sarah is definitely one of those stereotypical blonde pretty girls and my husband admits that it did kind of feel like he finally got his chance to be “popular” In a social setting. My husband admitted that Sarah basically mirrored everything about him. His likes his dislikes. She talked to him like he walked on water. It definitely sounded like she was boosting his ego In a manipulative fashion.

Like I said I understand this isn’t just a forgive and move on kind of situation but hearing my husband talk about it how it felt the way it affected him. It made me have a lot more sympathy for him.

I still haven’t come back home but we’re doing it one day at a time. I went and had lunch with him on Monday and I’m going again today. I’m trying to be there for him so he doesn’t feel alone.

I’m really ready for all this to die down. I’m hoping it doesn’t get taken farther at work but if it does we’ll deal with it

In 3 steps, I map out their fulfillment, find and fixing their hidden bottlenecks, and update their SOPs — all in one weekly meeting. 

It works really well, and I have several testimonials. But because its operations, it’s a longer sales process and a harder sale at the value it’s worth.

here’s what i ate throughout the day
- half of a coffee
- mini rice cakes
- freeze dried strawberries
- flamin hot popcorn ***
- mexican dish with cheese and rice as well as shrimp, steak, and chicken ***

*** a likely culprit as these were the last 2 things I ate

i am in pain right now with some stomach cramps as well as d*. like really bad. i have gotten up 3 times in the last hour to go to the bathroom. i come to lay down in bed and the cramps start again. i am terrified this is my worst nightmare of fp*

some background though that’s easing my mind slightly: 
lately i’ve been having GI issues and almost anything spicy has been giving me d*. i’m thinking the flamin hot popcorn has something slightly to do with this but this d* is a bit more intense than previous times. i also don’t believe that this is a sb* because i don’t know anybody that i’ve interacted with that had one.

i currently don’t feel nauseous it’s just cramps and d* but i’m terrified that this is how it’ll start but not how it’ll end up being. i know it’s the anticipation that gets to me but still. :(

I feel like I could be very good at it as I have decent experience in handling many complicated drink recipes and completing them at a fast pace. I’m 19 now but want to mainly focus on obtaining a TIPs certification (Im in the US in a state where you can bartend 18+, its just unlikely to be hired as a bartender under 21), and saving up money. I most likely wouldnt be trying to apply for a bartender position until I turn 20 this year

Would it be likely for me to get hired as one? Im shooting for somewhere in the airport, as I heard tips are generally better and the fast-paced environment helps the day go by faster. I enjoy making coffee but I dont feel like I even do that anymore, I just make coffee-flavored sugar condensed milkshakes for adult babies. Im aware serving alcohol is a different ball game but Ive had enough exposure to it in my life so far that I think i can handle the responsibility.

Number 1 I have bad handwriting. My time in the army left me with a broken hand and it affects the way that I write. Seriously it looks like a child wrote on the cup and I can do nothing about it

Number 2 it’s disingenuous to force people to write on cups. If you want to encourage it, great, find a better way to incentivize it rather than making it mandatory

Number 3 you’re deluding yourself if you think a normal customer cares more about getting a smiley face on their drink than a conversation or getting their coffee out quicker 

Number 4 The other day I got a super weird look from a customer because I handed her her drink that another barista put hearts on.  Not the best look for customers to think the male baristas are flirting with them bc of doodles on cups

All in all writing on cups is fun when we have the staffing for it and should be used as an additional tool for connecting to customers. Not a mandatory fireable offense. ",10,1739923220.0,starbucks,2,0.92,False

We have to make it through 4 more months before I come home. She is in her senior year of college and over time her friend group has dwindled, as happens when people start growing up and getting older. She has one or two friends remaining at school but no real friends she hangsout with outside of school. This weighs heavy on her self esteem and confidence. She has severe anxiety and with me being gone has begun self isolating. She goes to school, the gym, and occasionally walks around her local area. But the anxiety makes it hard for her to put herself out there. We have tried making a bumble BFF account but she gets scared to use it. She is worried she will be rejected or that people hate her. I have tried to tell her how worthy she is of friendship and fun and funny she is. I have tried coaching her on how to talk to other girls like at the gym or school to make friends. But she is having a hard time. I’m wondering if any people with anxiety or just women might give maybe advice about ways or places she can make friends. She doesn’t drink or party at all so that’s not an option.

Written by [Jim Willis, CMAS, CHS-V](https://utilitysecurity.com/blog/author/jimwillis/) on June 29, 2024. Posted in [Editorial](https://utilitysecurity.com/blog/category/editorial/).

# The most commonly used decision-making process is conjecture-based; we use it countless times daily. We go through life making decisions based on assumptions, speculation and whimsy, with little thought to impact or outcomes. However, when it comes to security, especially substation security, our decisions have consequences. For these decisions, we need a better decision-making method. We need a reliable technique that can produce sound decisions and stand up to intense scrutiny.

General Colin Powell once said: “*You can’t make good decisions unless you have good information and can separate facts from opinion and speculation. Facts are verified information, which is then presented as objective reality. The rub here is the verified. How do you verify verified?*”

In my previous article, I discussed how dangerous unverified assumptions can be when it comes to substation security issues. Now, we will consider the impact of our decision-making process on substation security. Critical decision-making has nothing to do with “criticizing”. In critical decision-making, we’re using the third definition of “critical” in the Merriam-Webster Dictionary: “*exercising or involving careful judgment or judicious evaluation*”.

At first glance, critical decision-making appears to be a complicated, overly sophisticated, technical process. In reality, it’s a learnable skill that anyone can employ. However, the methodical application of a rigorous problem-solving approach does require focus and discipline, so it isn’t effortless. *But, if you want easy, don’t pursue a career as a utility security practitioner*; it’s not easy or glamorous. It’s underappreciated hard work that can be extraordinarily satisfying. Okay, back to critical decision-making.

So, why is critical decision-making important? Its importance lies in its impact. Whether you are a member of a large security team with dozens of substations or the team is *you and a cup of coffee* with a couple of substations to deal with, you’re responsible for protecting the most critical infrastructure assets your organization possesses. (Generation protection is another story). If a security breach shuts down a substation, it shuts down a system. Shut down enough substations; you shut society down. Now add the axiom I’m continually repeating: *when it comes to utility security, you have to get it right every time; a threat actor only has to get it right once*. With this level of impact and responsibility, your decisions are important, so they need to be fact-based, reasoned, and defendable.

Critical decision-making is involved in every aspect of substation security. It is crucial in conducting security assessments, planning, and resource allocation. It’s an essential skill for investigations and forensic analysis and provides a strong foundation for litigation defense. It is also our mental best defense in a crisis. If you have a solid grasp of critical decision-making, you can make sound, quick, and decisive decisions even under duress.

**What is Critical Decision-Making?** It’s the process of objectively analyzing and evaluating information to form a qualified and defendable judgment. It involves gathering relevant information, interpreting it, assessing its value, and formulating ideas, theories, and solutions. Critical decision-making is crucial to making informed judgments and reaching rational conclusions. The process that leads the critical decision-making process is known as *Critical Thinking*.

Critical decision-making is based on a technique known as critical thinking. *Trust me, we’re not going in circles*. Critical thinking is essential for verifying information and making informed decisions. It helps identify mistakes, flawed conclusions, and misrepresentations. It allows you to sort through the fog of information overload to spot errors arising from unverified assumptions, unsubstantiated conclusions, and less rigorous decision-making processes. It also provides proven and defensible problem-solving methods, incident investigation approaches, and data analysis methods. However, in the critical decision-making process, critical thinking is not a stand-alone technique; it is best used in concert with analytical thinking and reasoning techniques.

Effective decision-making skills require understanding three information-processing techniques: *analytical thinking, critical thinking, and reasoning*; each is a specific information-gathering and deciphering method. The good news is that it doesn’t take a PhD to use these techniques, and you don’t need to master them in their entirety; you just need to understand the concepts, how they relate to each other, and how to put them into practice.

Is it possible to give you a complete lesson in the art of critical decision-making in one introductory article? Sadly, no; it’ll take a little more effort than that. However, I can introduce the key terms and concepts you need and point you in a direction for acquiring these skills to make informed decisions based on solid criteria, not conjecture.

**Analytical Thinking – Fact Based**  
Analytical thinking involves data harvesting and breaking down complex information into smaller parts. Analytical thinking is the logical and systematic breakdown of information. While the critical thinking process considers external criteria and knowledge, including institutional history, personal experience, and perspective, analytical thinking focuses on linear information processing. It’s the task of dispassionately collecting and sorting data to arrive at a conclusion. For those who have watched the television series, Star Trek, think of Mr. Spock.

Analytical Thinking:

* Breaks down complex information into smaller parts
* Is the systematic, linear, and logical sequencing of information
* Uses facts within the information gathered to support conclusions

The need to employ analytical thinking techniques should be your first consideration in the critical decision-making process. When you have a complex problem to solve or overwhelming amounts of information to process, you should put your analytical skills to work first. The goal will be to ensure that all relevant data or information is collected and evaluated without consideration of the information’s impact on the final analysis. Then, with all relevant data collected, compiled, and sorted, it’s time to shift gears and employ critical thinking skills.

**Critical Thinking – Judgment Based**  
Unlike analytical thinking, critical thinking involves making opinion-based judgments, which are arrived at by evaluating various sources of information, including expertise, knowledge, and experience.

Where analytical thinking is data harvesting, critical thinking is an investigative technique that involves assessing, questioning, verifying, inferring, interpreting, and formulation tasks. It also involves breaking down information into smaller parts and analyzing each part logically and systematically, but not in the dispassionate manner of analytical thinking. In critical thinking, even “gut feelings” count. In the critical thinking process, every form of information, including open-sourced data, subject-matter-expertise, and personal experience, is used to arrive at a well-considered decision or to produce an innovative solution. Think Sherlock Holmes.

Critical Thinking:

* Considers outside knowledge, including your own, when evaluating information
* Assesses, questions, verifies, infers, interprets, and formulates to be more holistic
* Uses other information to make judgments or find solutions
* Evaluates a myriad of sources to form an informed opinion

The critical thinking process verifies evidence, whether it supports or contradicts your initial assumptions and conclusions, before making a final judgment. It includes the consideration and unbiased evaluation of alternative possibilities to form a clear line of reasoning that leads to reasoned conclusions.

To give you an idea of the complexity of the critical thinking discipline, there are 14 commonly used tools or techniques in the critical thinking process. There are many more, but these fourteen will suffice. Personally, there are four I use regularly, and there are several that I’ve never used.

14 Critical Thinking tools:

1. Problem Restatement;
2. Pros, Cons, and Fixes;
3. Divergent/Convergent Thinking;
4. Sorting, Timelines, and Chronologies;
5. Causal Flow Diagramming;
6. Matrixes;
7. Scenarios;
8. Weighted Ranking;
9. Hypothesis Testing;
10. Devil’s Advocacy;
11. Probability Trees;
12. Utility Trees;
13. Utility Matrixes;
14. and Advanced Utility Analysis

In investigative analysis situations, I usually start with hypothesis testing. In contrast, I often begin with weighted ranking for criteria-based decisions. One of the basic principles of Hypothesis Testing is a great example of how a proven critical thinking technique can help guide your decision-making process.

In proving a hypothesis to be true, the number of consistencies isn’t as significant as the number of inconsistencies. In almost every case, when you apply hypothesis testing, you will find several potential outcomes that will have many of the same consistencies. The evidence will point to them. However, it’s the outcome or conclusion with the fewest inconsistencies that will prove to be the correct one. By the way, this is why an innocent person is often accused and sometimes convicted of a crime they didn’t commit. Once the investigators found evidence pointing to a person as the culprit, they stopped looking. They either failed to consider or discounted any evidence that didn’t support their decision (i.e., inconsistent evidence).

As a security professional, it is your responsibility to expend the energy and time resources needed to evaluate all the evidence or data provided until it is absolutely clear that you have reached the correct, defendable conclusion. Critical thinking provides the tools needed to do just that.

**Reasoning**  
Reasoning is the technique used to pull everything together. It takes the data-based results of analytical thinking and the opinion-based results derived from critical thinking, verifies tests, and critiques them to ensure a sound conclusion has been reached. By consciously applying reasoning to your decision-making process, you’ll minimize adverse consequences, ensure the accuracy of your outcomes, and achieve better results.

The reasoning process involves eight essential elements:

1. purpose,
2. problem/question clarification,
3. information,
4. interpretation,
5. concepts,
6. assumptions,
7. point of view,
8. and implications

Applying these elements as a reasoning checklist can be a valuable tool for breaking down complex problems, identifying causes, and finding solutions.

**The Role of Intellectual Standards**  
As a utility security professional, you are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and evaluating security-related data, investigating incidents, and creating reliable reports to aid your leadership’s decision-making. This includes security-related decisions regarding substations and other key infrastructure assets. You are the expert; it’s your responsibility to provide the best information and recommendations possible.

To achieve this, you must apply critical thinking processes and intellectual standards to analyze and report information. Professional rigor demands a systematic approach and comprehensive research from all available sources, identification of trends and patterns, accurate summaries of issues, and qualified recommendations for courses of action.

The role of critical decision-making in substation security cannot be overstated. Whether you’re evaluating security-related expenditures, investigating an incident, judging surveillance evidence, or conducting a threat assessment, your ability to gather, organize, and assess information and produce concrete and actionable decisions and recommendations is an essential but often overlooked skill. In a crisis, your ability to make quick, decisive, and defensible choices and institute effective damaging-mitigating countermeasures will be tied directly to your critical decision-making skills.

By utilizing critical thinking and analytical thinking techniques and adhering to intellectual standards, you can generate informative and accurate reports that keep your team informed of incidents, offer sound advice to leadership, and provide expert support to your utility on potential threats. So, make sure you have a firm grasp of critical decision-making techniques and expend the time and effort needed to apply them. As a utility security practitioner, the only decisions you may come to regret are those you didn’t critique through the critical decision-making process.

# The most commonly used decision-making process is conjecture-based; we use it countless times daily. We go through life making decisions based on assumptions, speculation and whimsy, with little thought to impact or outcomes. However, when it comes to security, especially substation security, our decisions have consequences. For these decisions, we need a better decision-making method. We need a reliable technique that can produce sound decisions and stand up to intense scrutiny.

General Colin Powell once said: “*You can’t make good decisions unless you have good information and can separate facts from opinion and speculation. Facts are verified information, which is then presented as objective reality. The rub here is the verified. How do you verify verified?*”

In my previous article, I discussed how dangerous unverified assumptions can be when it comes to substation security issues. Now, we will consider the impact of our decision-making process on substation security. Critical decision-making has nothing to do with “criticizing”. In critical decision-making, we’re using the third definition of “critical” in the Merriam-Webster Dictionary: “*exercising or involving careful judgment or judicious evaluation*”.

At first glance, critical decision-making appears to be a complicated, overly sophisticated, technical process. In reality, it’s a learnable skill that anyone can employ. However, the methodical application of a rigorous problem-solving approach does require focus and discipline, so it isn’t effortless. *But, if you want easy, don’t pursue a career as a utility security practitioner*; it’s not easy or glamorous. It’s underappreciated hard work that can be extraordinarily satisfying. Okay, back to critical decision-making.

So, why is critical decision-making important? Its importance lies in its impact. Whether you are a member of a large security team with dozens of substations or the team is *you and a cup of coffee* with a couple of substations to deal with, you’re responsible for protecting the most critical infrastructure assets your organization possesses. (Generation protection is another story). If a security breach shuts down a substation, it shuts down a system. Shut down enough substations; you shut society down. Now add the axiom I’m continually repeating: *when it comes to utility security, you have to get it right every time; a threat actor only has to get it right once*. With this level of impact and responsibility, your decisions are important, so they need to be fact-based, reasoned, and defendable.

Critical decision-making is involved in every aspect of substation security. It is crucial in conducting security assessments, planning, and resource allocation. It’s an essential skill for investigations and forensic analysis and provides a strong foundation for litigation defense. It is also our mental best defense in a crisis. If you have a solid grasp of critical decision-making, you can make sound, quick, and decisive decisions even under duress.

**What is Critical Decision-Making?** It’s the process of objectively analyzing and evaluating information to form a qualified and defendable judgment. It involves gathering relevant information, interpreting it, assessing its value, and formulating ideas, theories, and solutions. Critical decision-making is crucial to making informed judgments and reaching rational conclusions. The process that leads the critical decision-making process is known as *Critical Thinking*.

Critical decision-making is based on a technique known as critical thinking. *Trust me, we’re not going in circles*. Critical thinking is essential for verifying information and making informed decisions. It helps identify mistakes, flawed conclusions, and misrepresentations. It allows you to sort through the fog of information overload to spot errors arising from unverified assumptions, unsubstantiated conclusions, and less rigorous decision-making processes. It also provides proven and defensible problem-solving methods, incident investigation approaches, and data analysis methods. However, in the critical decision-making process, critical thinking is not a stand-alone technique; it is best used in concert with analytical thinking and reasoning techniques.

Effective decision-making skills require understanding three information-processing techniques: *analytical thinking, critical thinking, and reasoning*; each is a specific information-gathering and deciphering method.

I made a post in r/travel and got some great advice and I think I've nailed down my basic itinerary for Colombia with my partner. Thought I would ask here to get some more specific advice on Eje Cafetero and how to get off the beaten path a bit. Also, if you're willing, I'll post my basic itinerary below and I'd love it if you could take a look!

We would love to go to a cloud forest in the coffee region. Is the best way to do so to stay in Salento and then get a tour? We are definitely going to do the Valle de Cocora hike, probably for a full day if there's enough to see. Other than Salento and Filandia, is there anywhere else we should stay or go? 

Hostel recs are also always welcome!!

Itinerary is below. Overall, I think this hits a good balance of city and nature and has a good flow related to our flights. I'm mainly worried about not having enough time in Cartagena, but I've also heard it's very touristy.

*  March 6 (land, half day) - Cartagena
* March 7 - Cartagena (full day in city)
* March 8 - Cartagena (Rosarios and snorkeling)
* March 9 - Cartagena → Tayrona (stay night near El Zaino entrance)
* March 10 - Tayrona full day (stay night in park)
* March 11 - Tayrona (exit through Calabazo to see Pueblito) → Santa Marta (for a night)
* March 12 - Santa Marta → fly to Pereira or Armenia (morning), Eje Cafetero
* March 13 - Eje Cafetero
* March 14 - Eje Cafetero
* March 15 - Eje Cafetero
* March 16 - Eje Cafetero
* March 17 - Eje Cafetero → Medellin
* March 18 - Medellin
* March 19 - Medellin (Guatape day)
* March 20 - Medellin
* March 21 - Medellin (fly out)",0,1739921766.0,TravelNoPics,0,0.5,False

1isqpic,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1isqpic/i_hate_it_when_im_right_sometimes/,I hate it when I'm right... sometimes.,"I had this gut instinct that I was never more than a power play for you - something to distract you from the misery of your present circumstances. 

That's why I refused to accept your flattery. That's why I refused a coffee date. That's why I refused to believe you genuinely thought I was beautiful, or intelligent. 


So when you went from hot to freezing cold overnight, my gut instinct was confirmed. Had this been a normal situation in which a man was showing affection for a woman because he liked her, and for no other reason, I would have happily accepted your coffee date, and your flattery, and who knows what else - but it wasn't that. It never was. I was a toy for you, and I knew it. 

I refuse to be played with, so I refused to play the game. 

And when you realized that I wasn't going to play your game, you stopped playing too, because that kind of game isn't fun to play alone.


So now, I'm sitting alone in my house, metaphorically bleeding. Because on one hand, I hate that I was right. You were very convincing with your words, and very smooth with your flattery. As a woman with low self-esteem, it felt really, really good to have such an intelligent and handsome person telling me that I was intelligent and beautiful. It felt like a peer-reviewed study rather than a conspiracy theory, in terms of emotional authenticity. You were a verified critic of both beauty and intellect; one with good credentials.

So when my gut instinct was confirmed, in a way, it felt like also confirming that I am neither intelligent nor beautiful.

That's why I hate it when I'm right, sometimes. It can be very humbling.

But on the other hand...

In this instance, I'm equally glad that I was right about you.

Because it means that my discernment is getting sharper. It means I am becoming less vulnerable to manipulators. And for me, coming from the background that I'm coming from? Well, that's a ***huge*** deal.


So I've dodged a bullet, but scraped my knees. 

I'll be okay. It's just going to sting for a little while. 

And I'll save myself the trouble of a much worse heartbreak later, as a result of not playing with a fire that would absolutely burn me to the ground. 


I feel bad for whatever woman falls for your charms in the future.

She's going to have a very bad time. 

Not at first. 

But, in the long run, yes - a very bad time, indeed.

This time i need a good suggestion for the name of the game i am developing. The project is called Argen Pifia because i am from Argentina, but the game is not about my country and it's not the only game made in my country. That's why i'm asking you, the good people of internet, how would you name a game about being an adventurer in a medieval fantasy world (there is no magic, just dangerous monsters and spirits), with just 2 bucks in your pockets and too much coffee in you because you need therapy but you have no money for it. The game is more about investigation and social interaction rather than combat. Your flaws can influence the actions of your character, and you are not a powerful hero, just a random guy that need something to live for.

1isqhq6,https://i.redd.it/fjrrezacezje1.jpeg,Elevated tryptase. Now what?,"
Hello,

I (39f) have been working with an allergist to understand the root of some of my symptoms. I’ve suspected something like MCAS could be a factor for some time and my tryptase level (measured at the tail end of a flare) was mildly elevated so he wants to talk about options and next steps. Any advice on how I should proceed or prepare for this convo? Thanks for your help!

Primary Symptoms 
- chronic urticaria with unknown trigger. Happens more after strenuous and prolonged exercise but not exclusively. No apparent connection to foods. (onset at adulthood, but infrequent until the last year or so).
- Chronic non-allergic rhinitis triggered by endurance exercise. (Onset in the last 5 years)

Labs
- Tryptase - 11.7 - slightly elevated  during flare
- Ferritin 11 (iron deficient)*
- Homocysteine 14 (elevated)*
- Serum IgE normal during flare 
- Chronic Urticaria AB panel - negative 

Related Symptoms or Conditions 
- GERD & IBS-D*(improving since 4 months alcohol and coffee cessation, and treatment for SIBO in January). This might be the root cause of iron deficiency and homocysteine due to malabsorption. 
- POTS symptoms (no Dx) eg. Racing heart, faintness and loss of vision when changing positions, high RHR and low HRV. 
- Sometimes tight chest or short of breath at rest (history of well controlled asthma). 
- Raynaud’s (Dx in high school but worsening this year)
- MTHFR variant reduced flare synthesis, Slow COMT and others of questionable relevance.  
- Early perimenopause - still cycling regularly but cycle is shortening and menstruation is heavier but still considered “normal” volume as measured by menstrual cup. 
- Oral allergy syndrome - itchy throat when eating certain foods like melons, raw carrots. This doesn’t lead to more serious symptoms as far as I’ve noticed. 
- History of eczema that is controlled with sensitive skin products
- History of flushing/hives with alcohol (last few years only, not always).

The reason I believe it’s a hypomanic episode is because have not been experiencing trouble sleeping, (I sleep 12 hours) or having any crazy delusions or hallucinations , the worst is just feeling like ive had some coffee or something.


I am wondering, is it even normal to have these hypomanic symptoms for this long, or maybe there is something else going on mentally for me (like adhd or ocd) on the side that could be tricking/confusing me

hi! first of all this was the first time i ever intentionally ended a friendship i have had friendships fading before too but this one was  like quite literal and i feel horrible guilt that affects my life a lot. so i became friends with person in 2020 through a friend. i always considered us to be like from ""different genres"" if it makes sense but intentionally i was interested in her because i thought she was into spirituality like i am but i ended up finding out it's more like a vibe to her and she is actually a kind of a person that makes me feel suffocated and a lot of our friendship in my view was me playing a role that was a fake persona overall during that period of my life. Around the time we met i kind of ignored my authentic self that had always been suppressed anyways and started to mold myself into something someone else would like to compensate and escape fear if judgement and failure. i kind of tried to please her too via clothing abd i just webt along with her because i looked up to her. if i think it more psychologically she reminds me of a friend type from childhood where she is the cool kid and I'm a little foolish and try to be cool too. another dynamic is me and my mom where I'm her little bestie therapist and we talk about things I'm not interested in or that are really not appropriate for me yet or idk I'm playing older than i actually am (and i really was because of shame, not just in our friendship but overall). Overall she is like a mom and i am a teenager who no longer wants to be a mom's side kick and in some odd way, I'm not just projecting, her expressions remind me of some aunts and i feel uncomfortable by the judgy vibe , or not judgy but displeased. She did listen to my things too tho and she is not a bad person or anything but in 2023 i just realized how much of a fake person i am and it's just become more clear over the past year and in november i met the friend and i talked very openly and i realized how different our core values are and a few weeks ago she asked me for a coffee but i said i actually don't want to be friends anymore. for more context, for example last year, we didn't meet other than that time in november and we don't talk too much so it's not like we were super duper close or at least in my end the me she knew was kind of a patch and the whole time we were friends i was in a wounded state anyways and supressing my truth which is now surfacing. but i feel so guilty and i have thoughts of me just seeking attention or being too dramaatic by telling her i don't want to be friends anymore. how can i stop ruminating it?

 I was on a 3rd date with a guy I really liked (who became my BF for 7 months). Our first date was just for a quick coffee and we got along great, we walked around my neighborhood in the city for a bit and said goodnight. We talked and texted a lot leading up to the 2nd date and I already seen the BF material potential. He went all out on the 2nd date at a fancy restaurant and I didn’t want to ruin things by having hooking up so I texted my FWB to come over after the date which he did. 

 3rd date was all set up, we were to meet at a bar/restaurant on the same block I live on. I still didn’t want to give it up just yet so I texted my FWB to possibly come over afterwards. He unfortunately couldn’t make it afterwards as he had plans but could beforehand. I agreed even though his ETA was cutting it close to my date, half hour to be exact. 

15 mins gone by and FWB was a no show, I texted him and he said he got out of the gym late but he’s on his way. Pissed off at him I just said “ok see ya soon” even though I didn’t plan to, I decided to venture early to the bar and texted my date I’m already here waiting, he responded that he is parking ATM and will be there soon. He gets there and we order drinks and now there’s way more flirting from him than  our 2 previous dates and the phone conversations we had during that time. 

 I then get a text from FWB, a good 25 mins into the date and later than he said he would be over mind you, that he’s pulling up my street now by my apartment. I told him it was too late, I was already on my date and thanks a lot because I’m gonna ruin things being horny AF now. IDK why,  but when he jokingly said he’d come to the bar and meet me in the stall real quick to help hold myself off,  I said yes. 

 He walked in shortly after, right past the both of us and went to another part of the bar and ordered a drink from a bartender we both know as he came in this place often with me. My date started to get all touchy with me which wasn’t helping matters so after 5 mins I got up and walked towards the bathrooms (they are unisex stalls) looked at FWB as I walked by and he quickly started following me back. 

 I found a stall and waited for him to enter, shit the door, pulled down his boxers and started sucking his dick. Once he was hard he bent me over and started fucking me. About 3 mins into it he tells me he’s gonna cum soon, I know you’re gonna kiss dude later and on you and your clothes are out, what should I do? I told him to just cum in me, he does. 

 We both leave the bathroom, me first and as I entered the bar I seen the bartender talking to my date. She definitely knew what’s up given she knows me and FWB, and during the rest of the night kept looking at me with a demonic look… next time I seen her she confirmed. I enjoyed the rest of the date and future bf turned the conversation sexual and started touching my bare legs and casually kissed me occasionally. I was still turned on and just wanted to call it a night with the date and go home to my toys or go round 2 with FWB who was still at the bar. 

I told my date I was ready to leave as we previously planned a short date anyway since it was a weeknight. He started getting all touchy on the short walk back and I was still turned on so we go into the entrance hallway of my apartment and he started kissing me at my door. I told him what a great kisser he is and then he put his hands under my dress and started rubbing my pussy through my panties and commented how wet I was, it wasn’t just me, FWBs cum was still squishing inside of me during the rest of the date and leaking out. 

 I told him I wasn’t ready to have sex just yet and to say good bye but then when he responded that no sex is cool but he wanted me to sit in his face I couldn’t say no. We went into my place and right on my couch and I did just that. I never came so much between still being turned on from FWB and his oral skills were 5 star. I kinda felt guilty so I turned around and we 69ed. 

 We winded up dating for a good 7 months and I always felt guilty about that. Toward the end things got heated and we broke up. 2 weeks later I decided to text him and he was a major dick. I responded with screenshots from texts that day between me and FWB as well as a few texts conversations we had afterwards about that whole bathroom meet up. As soon as I seen he read them I blocked him.

1isq4m8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1isq4m8/making_my_own_garlic_butter_confit/,Making my own garlic butter confit.,"I recently bought some ghee and used it to make a garlic confit it was amazing I used most of it to make a dip for crab legs and the rest for a lasagna style pasta bake. Not counting the bits that just got eaten along the way! So today I'm going to try making my own in starting with unsalted butter rather than cream because I use the cream for coffee and I only have a quart. And I had an extra pound of butter in the fridge.

So I already melted the butter and out it in the fridge to separate. I don't think I got it got enough to boil off any water. So at the moment from my research I am thinking of altering a standard recipe a bit. 

Here's what I'm thinking. I'm going to take the milk solids and mix them with the garlic which I will mince and then rust that in a pan on the stove until it starts to brown. This should add a sweetness and a nuttiness. Then I'll add that all into the butter and simmer on a low heat for an hour or so. Making sure not to burn the garlic or the milk solids. I'll then scoop it the solids and mix with a portion of the clarified butter and blend in my magic bullet this should ideally make an incredible spread. I'll keep the remaining infused clarified butter for other uses.

This is new to me so if anyone has any suggestions or tips on how I can improve on my process or what I can use the resulting stuff for please let me know the clarified butter is going to take at least a few more hours to solidify and I have a several pounds of produce I need to juice.

Overall she is like a mom and i am a teenager who no longer wants to be a mom's side kick and in some odd way, I'm not just projecting, her expressions remind me of some aunts and i feel uncomfortable by the judgy vibe , or not judgy but displeased. She did listen to my things too tho and she is not a bad person or anything but in 2023 i just realized how much of a fake person i am and it's just become more clear over the past year and in november i met the friend and i talked very openly and i realized how different our core values are and a few weeks ago she asked me for a coffee but i said i actually don't want to be friends anymore. for more context, for example last year, we didn't meet other than that time in november and we don't talk too much so it's not like we were super duper close or at least in my end the me she knew was kind of a patch and the whole time we were friends i was in a wounded state anyways and supressing my truth which is now surfacing. but i feel so guilty and i have thoughts of me just seeking attention or being too dramaatic by telling her i don't want to be friends anymore. how can i stop ruminating it?

Me (realizing I’m standing on a landmine in clown shoes): Oh! I just meant…you know…the *vibe* of the weekend! Ha…ha…”

Boss (leaning in, nostrils flaring): Wait. Your Slack status was ‘Vacation’ yesterday. We don’t OFFER Presidents Day off. Who the HELL do you think you’re working for?”

Me (backpedaling like a Tour de France loser): Nonono, I just meant—!”

J1’s CEO emails me 10 minutes later: “We’ve terminated your access. Our lawyers will be in touch.” Both jobs gone because I couldn’t shut up about my *precious three-day weekend*. Now I’m unemployed, unemployable, and my cat’s judging me.

2) Mention weekends, holidays, or the concept of “time.”  
3) Pretend to care about corporate culture. Ever.

At a certain age, I became interested and after falling off my dad’s unicycle a few to many times he bought me my own. 

When he did I cried and cried and told him I did not want it . I knew money was scarce and because of that I did not want the obligations to learn. Mostly I was afraid of how my dad would feel towards me if he spent that money and I failed to accomplish the task. 

Looking back, it’s sad to think about the the things kids understand and the unspoken rules of the house.

However, I would eventually learn. Sure it took a while and during the course of those few weeks and perhaps a month I acquired my fair share of bumps and bruises. To the point that my school prinicpal asked me if everything was ok at home. I guess they also knew my father’s temper .But sure enough one day I would ride my unicycle to school and put the school admin and staff at ease. 

I road that unicycle for years and years . It kind of became my niche in the neighborhood and something I became known for. I even rode it in the school play :)

However, some where in middle school or at thr start of puberty I put it to the side and eventually it just became a little piece of rust that was placed outside .

Now to fast forward more than three decades I was leaving work and what did I see but a little boy riding a unicycle. Being one of my science students I walked over to talk to him and inquire about his talent.

He eventually handed me the unicycle to see if I could ride. Not telling him my previous talents , I adjusted the seat and took it for a short spin. 

On my first attempt I barely got a foot before hoping off but on my second attempt all the sparks in my brain fired and muscle memory took over and I was off.

There I was this adult man pedaling and balancing for my dear life. Heart pounding and fears of falling down in front of my student causing blood to pump at a level I have not felt in years . 

But I was a doing it, I was riding it and while I did all the memories of a small poor child came rushing back to me. It was more exciting to me than riding a rollercoaster but also sad. 

Sad for the loss of my talent and sad for thr little boy I used to be. 

On the way home i reflected of all the lessons I learned on the single wheel. I also thought of my student and how his life might be and the small connection between us. 

However, today on this Saturday morning, I am contemplating picking up my old hobby again. At my age I might break a bone or seriously injure myself but still the thought is there. 

Perhaps I am missing my youth or perhaps I am missing my fathers approval or perhaps I am missing the dreams that I once had on that single wheel . What ever the case, these are the thoughts on this early morning. ",3,1739919509.0,OVER30REDDIT,0,1.0,False

I started lithium and lamictal at the same time so I have no basis on if they work ok on their own. I know my mood improved greatly for a while but its getting bad again, it could be due to external factors, moving to a new state recently, searching for jobs, stress ,and stress from politics could be bringing me down. 

  
I see my new psych thursday. I want to bring up to her the thought of going off of my lithium. I am currently on 150 lamictal, 300 lithium, and a low 25 seroquel for sleep. 

I am considering changing the lithium for 2 reasons, 1,  I have gained about 25 lbs since starting and its really stressing and messing with my self esteem, and 2, I am starting a new job as a barista and will probably be drinking more coffee soon so lol. I know you have to be careful with coffee intake on lithium.

1isptyk,https://i.redd.it/gx81wk2k9zje1.png,MacDonald's Gardens park - Ottawa’s Hidden Graveyard,"In 1920, city workers were landscaping the park when a passerby noticed something unusual—a round object rolling down an embankment. It turned out to be a human skull. Turns out, MacDonald's park was once a graveyard for some of Ottawa’s earliest settlers, and while many remains were moved to Beechwood Cemetery in the 1870s, not all of them made the trip. Instead, the unclaimed bodies were left behind, buried under what is now a small park in centertown. 
For years, the land sat abandoned, with cows grazing among toppled tombstones. In 1911, the city flattened everything—tombstones, bones, and all—before repurposing it as a public park.
The city eventually paved over the forgotten graves, reading the names of the deceased aloud at a council meeting as a final act of respect. But even today, skeletal remains and old tombstones still rest beneath the surface.

Uhhh idk. 

We are open to adding 2 seats to face the sectional. Or should we just do a sofa and loveseat instead? Just wanted yalls opinions since I have no idea what I’m doing. 

Also, The blue tape was just to give us an idea of the size of coffee table or media center to get (prob will only mount the tv and not have a media center tho)

We are big lounging people who spend majority of our time on the couch. I wanted a more modern looking couch with deeper and wider seats but couldn’t find anything much better than this. If y’all have any other suggestions, do let me know.

How fun would it be to have Lane meet this guy when she was at Yale. They could have been in line at the coffee cart and she noticed a band shirt or something and that sparked a conversation about music. Not even having to make it a romantic connection (although ASP did make her boy crazy at first) but a fun music friend. A friend at Yale that’s not Rory. Gives her somewhere else to be besides the dorm.

I know Lane isn’t a main character so it’s not realistic to have a bunch of sub plot storylines about her but it would have been fun.

1ispqo9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ispqo9,In need of some serious help dialing in [Breville Bambino],"I am brand new to coffee. In fact, I attempted pulling my first shots of espresso just today. I have the breville bambino and baratza encore esp (predictable I know). 

I used a grind setting of 15 on the baratza as I hear it’s a good place to start. First attempt 18g in, nowhere near 36g out despite being well over 30 seconds. Second time around I tried to pull the shot manually and it took damn near close to 2 minutes to reach 36g out. In fact it took almost a whole minute for the machine to initiate pouring which I thought was odd. I used the same grind setting because I just wanted to change one thing at a time and didn’t think I needed to grind even coarser but maybe I do? When I dumped the shot into my mug the “crema” almost looked like it was curdling (pictured). Both shots were incredibly bitter. Completely repulsive. 

For more context: using double basket, single wall, no bottomless portafilter, no WDT tool but tried my best with distribution and tamping straight, bambino bought on their remanufactuted website, coffee beans were roasted two weeks ago are are a darker roast.

Open to suggestions. I don’t want to resort to getting a bunch of new equipment and be too quick to blame the problem on my set up or lack of tools, as it’s much more likely related to my technique as a novice.

1ispqi8,https://www.reddit.com/r/MontagneParfums/comments/1ispqi8/a_long_list_of_short_reviews_in_no_particular/,A Long List of Short Reviews (in no particular order),"Hey all, here is a list of all the fragrances I’ve tried, mostly in the form of decants, some were blind buys. I’ve honestly been blown away with Montagne, the quality, and just an all around awesome way to test out different types of fragrances, niche houses I never would think to try, or even notes that I thought I would steer clear from. Plus an awesome community. Remember these are my opinions based on my skin chemistry, fragrance preferences are subjective.

Shoutout to u/ayybrahamlmaocoln for the decants and all the help…a man who needs no introduction.

Without further ado:

Cognac d’ange - Very pleasant, kind of reminds me of Khamrah (which many people don’t find a good clone of angels share) but better quality and no dates mega sweetness. I can see the hype but is a tad boring to me since there are so many dupes of AS.

Wajan - I actually enjoyed this more than cognac d’ange which it gets compared to, more spices and character, I can see where people mention it being Christmas-y, may get a full bottle later. This one cut through the cold on a Chicago sub 32 degree day. 

Eau Santal - solid, reminiscent of Cremo’s palo santo (I have the beard wash) but fresher and the sandalwood really comes across in the mid, long lasting. I don’t pick up the dill note (even if I did, I love dill) on the fence of full bottle but could see myself liking this more and more.

Eau Matcha - It’s super pleasant, the first time I tried it, it didn’t last long at all but I revisited it and it seemed to stick on me for hours. Reminds me of springtime, with a burst of green tea rather than matcha which I think of as more milky. Lasts 5+ hours though at a skin scent. Would get whiffs here and there from clothing.

Eau Noir - Very good, light airy fig and citrus. Longevity is persistent while projection isn’t very loud. I’m a fan and this is an easy wear, while I don’t think it’s super captivating, it’s versatile while not being a blue freshly. Considering a full bottle.

Pineapple absolu - Eh, I t’s fine, but I was hoping for more from this. I still get the aventus dna but was looking to be wowed…and I wasn’t unfortunately.

Gustavo - very good, light, mountain air, kept getting whiffs and very addictive, may have oversprayed on my second wear and was picking up an anise note to my nose. Still very enjoyable. Does anyone get similarities with this and Eau Noir?

Torino2021 - starts off very lemony and sharp. The dry down is great, a solid freshy because of the mint and basil it never got too sweet. I do wish it lasted longer - purchased a full bottle.

Torino2022 - very solid, but not my speed. I can see the resemblance of BR540 and smarties candy. May need more tests to give it its flowers

Tabac Vanille - I preferred this over Ambre Vanille in terms of a vanilla scent (yes, I know they are very different). Not as sweet gourmand as AV and heavier spices. 1:1 with OG tobacco Vanille, like crazy close and lasts 7+ hours, nuclear.

Image45 - Soft but very intense like almost nauseatingly toothpaste-y, I think I’d like Image, the toned down version, better. It’s weird how soft it is but it’s a wall of intense softness.

Galilean - very good, magazine paper, I get juniper somehow but maybe that’s the mix of mandarin and mineral notes? Almost made me think of a futuristic tv with static blaring. But not sure how often I’d wear it. Might need to revisit.

Phantom Noir - loved the coffee note in this and it never got too sweet. Some ppl have said performance on this was almost eternal but I feel on my skin it was short lived. I did enjoy this as a scent in the morning for running errands.

God of Fiery - this was a good mango fragrance with some blue undertones but leaned a bit feminine for me, which I don’t mind, I gave it to my wife because  she loved it. 

Enigmatic Exclusif - Now this, this is something….something of an enigma 😉 Absolutely loved this one. I can’t wait for the restock.  It’s very quirky like a deconstructed cola or root beer where you can pick up various notes separately, but they blend together so well, if that makes sense. Imagine you have some high quality headphones and you’re listening to a great vinyl with a wall of sound, but if you pay attention and concentrate, you can pick out each note on its own. Love it. 

Plum Japonais - I definitely pick up the plum liquor and almost get a cola vibe in the background during the opening. Love this one and will def get a full bottle. More of a fancy night out vibe, but doesn’t mean I won’t wear this casually. It is dense and thick but also light and vivacious.

Another 14 - Ordered a full bottle, I like the musks and the way it changes on skin, this is a great anytime, just for me type of scent. Since I work from home I am always applying fragrances throughout the day. And this is just easy and fun, staying close to skin but lasting easy over 5+ hours. Just when I forget about it, boom I get a wallop of subtle sweetness and musk.

Ombré Noir - I made a review of this a few weeks back. I also bought a full bottle. This one is so elegant and classy, perfect for the winter, it is a monster, not for the faint of heart but I love it. The jammy rose and juicy raspberry would be too bright without the darkness of the oud that pulls it down to earth.

Gentle Silver - bought a bottle after first test spray, this is incredible. It makes me picture sipping a gin and tonic at the bar and a beautiful woman that just sprayed a nice perfume before walking in, sat down next to you. So versatile and uplifting. Juniper, fruits, bergamot, dried down nice and woody.

Jubilee - An incredible scent that I just wished lasted longer. I pick up oud and blackberry but then it’s gone unfortunately.

Monkey Special - pretty good, nice fruity scent with dark undertones. I don’t get much booze/rum. I like this one but for some reason I find it safe when I know it isn’t. I hate to say it but it just doesn’t wow me. 

Ambre Vanille - A bit too much sweet vanilla, I like the supporting spice notes but I felt like a walking cinnamon sugar cookie. Great projection and longevity but not my vibe. I feel like I’m about to sneeze during the opening.

Orange Oud - MY GOODNESS. This was straight out of left field. I didn’t even consider sampling this one and it was in an order I put in with Ayyb instead of a LNDL2011 unreleased sample which I am soo happy it was. When I first sprayed it I was thinking “hmm the coconut and vanilla give this a sunscreen vibe, not that it was bad, but then the dry down. Whoa! The creaminess of the coconut and vanilla just rode a wave that didn’t quit and I could not stop smelling myself, I HAD to get a bottle. I find myself smelling the atomizer every time I walk by. Def won’t be for everyone but this was insanely good to me.
 
Imaginary - This is fantastic and I see everyone talking about it. It’s a great freshy with pops of orange and the tea note gives it a great balance, very soapy. Is it a very good scent? Yes. Will it blow your balls off? Maybe yours, but to me it’s a good freshy that dare I say is overhyped? Or just hyped…idk
 
Immensity - blind bought a bottle of this when I first heard of Montagne. Ginger, citrus and Ambroxan. But it just works and is so bright, and uplifting, I’ve thought about spraying after the shower before bed but always feel like it will give me my second wind and won’t sleep. One of my most complimented (not that I seek them) It projects like crazy in the heat. I do not get BO smell.

Pineapple Intense - blind bought, good scent but the aventus dna is played out for me. I feel it doesn’t last very long either unfortunately. Super versatile, juicy pineapple and black currant with smoky undertones. Honestly when I first got it, it was so smoky and reminded me of friends that would douse themselves in cologne after smoking cigs before grade school, kind of nostalgic.

Elysian Intense - another blind buy and it’s worth it, just wish it lasted more than 3-4 hours. The vetiver in this is incredible and just feels like sparkly sunshine in the summer to me.

Perceval - I purchased this from another member and didn’t realize it was the pre-reformulated version. It’s still decent but smells a bit off. I keep it in my gym bag, it isn’t bad it just doesn’t smell complete in the opening but dries down nicely with lavender and other aromatics.


As you can see I like the oddball scents that just do something different. There isn’t a single Montagne that I hate, I appreciate them in their own way. Hoping to try some of the under the radar scents soon too. Hope you enjoyed.",24,1739919133.0,MontagneParfums,10,0.96,False
1isppqc,https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/1isppqc/green_tea_allergybest_alternatives/,green tea allergy…best alternatives?,"so I am extremely sensitive to caffeine and can’t have coffee. also, black tea is painful as well for whatever reason, upsets my stomach. green tea however…now what I learned, I learned through drinking these new “healthy” sodas. poppi soda, I noticed when I’d drink it, the caffeine would be such a nice experience. not too much, not too little. no negative side effects, but still noticeable energy boost. so I looked into it and it comes from green tea. my problem…I suffer from oral allergy syndrome and green tea is one of the things I’m allergic to. 

any good green tea like alternatives? like perhaps a caffeinated white tea? or a light colored tea? it seems the darker the tea the more likely it’ll upset my stomach. but so far my only known allergy is specifically to green tea. 

thanks in advance!",0,1739919084.0,tea,9,0.17,False
