Same.

I’m ambitious. I have dreams that keep me awake at night. But weirdly, I often feel lazy — procrastinating, scrolling endlessly, or just feeling drained even before starting.

So what's going on?
It’s not always laziness. Sometimes it’s:

✖ Burnout disguised as laziness
✖ Fear of failure or starting
✖ Overwhelm from having too many goals
✖ Lack of structure or routine
✖ Mental fatigue from constant overthinking
I realized being “lazy” doesn’t mean you’re not driven — it might mean you don’t have the systems in place to support your drive.
What helped me cope:

✅ Micro Habits – Instead of huge goals, I started tiny (e.g., 10 mins of focused work instead of 2 hours).
✅ Clear priorities – I chose 1 goal to chase at a time, not 5.
✅ Environment change – Decluttering my space improved my energy instantly.
✅ Movement – A 15-minute walk resets my brain more than a coffee.
✅ Self-compassion – I stopped calling myself lazy and started asking why I feel stuck.
✅ Accountability – Telling a friend or community about my goals added positive pressure.

If you’re in the same boat — ambitious but tired — you’re not alone.
You're not broken. You're human.

Start small. Be kind to yourself. Stay consistent even when you don’t feel like it.
That’s the real flex. 🔥

Would love to hear how others deal with this. What worked for you?",1,1754461343.0,Discipline,0,1.0,False

1mix30h,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1mix30h/my_boyfriend_is_taking_pieces_of_me_while_i_sleep/,My Boyfriend is Taking Pieces of me While I Sleep,"I’ve always been a people pleaser. Even as a kid, I’ve always had the hardest time asserting myself or saying no. As long as the other person’s content, I could deal with some uncomfortable feelings. It probably has something to do with daddy issues. At least that’s what all my therapists have told me, obviously not using those exact words. Although, I don’t know if hearing the question “How’s your relationship with your father?” from some old broad after dumping half of my trauma is any better.

Anyway, I‘ve been through some shit. It’s kind of a blessing and a curse when you think about it. Going through trauma can simultaneously be debilitating and advantageous. I’ve always had boyfriend problems. That was until I met him.

There was nothing terribly special about Tristan that met the eye. He was attractive, for sure, but nothing that could turn heads. At 27, he still lived with his parents until he moved in with me. He didn’t really have any sort of career either. He worked at our local grocery store bagging groceries for the mostly elderly people who lived in our lazy town in central Florida. He was also kind of a sickly guy, he was always in and out of urgent care with some sort of pain or ailment of sorts. Even if he was smiling and happy, his face was always slightly tense, like he was in physical pain and trying to ignore it. It was just kind of weird because there was never actually anything wrong with him. Like, there was no diagnosis. He was just ill.

His personality is what got me, though. The second he opens his mouth, everyone’s on him like flies. I remember when we first started dating, my parents had met him a total of two times when they told me that I should marry the guy. Every friend I’ve ever had became one of his good friends too. They’d rant and rave about how much of a genuinely good guy he was. He really, really was. I felt so insanely lucky, especially because he was such a breath of fresh air compared to the other sleazeballs I’d wasted my time with.

He wasn’t lustful like the others. He didn’t even bring up the idea of having sex until I brought it up first. He was in touch with his emotions too. I mean, the first time he told me he loved me he had tears in his eyes. And ever since, he’d profess his love for me time and time again, going into great detail about how I was the love of his life and his soulmate. We did everything together, and it wasn’t long until we moved in together. It was like an endless sleepover with my bestest friend. Finally, I was at peace.

Up until a few weeks ago.

I was driving him to work and we were blasting The 1975 on my radio, occasionally cringing because the speakers were blown. Tristan lowered the volume of the music and looked at me, like he always does when he has something to ask me that I might have a problem with. I side-eyed him and chuckled.

“What’s up? I know that look.”

He also chuckled and turned away from me, trying to mask the bashful look on his face.

“Nah, um. I was just wondering, baby…” He put his hand on my thigh and caressed it. “Could you cover dinner for today? It could be something cheap like fast food. I just… I don’t have a lot right now.”

I clenched my jaw. That hadn’t been the first time he’s asked me that. Or second or third. Matter of fact, he’d blow through his check in a matter of days, and I was the idiot to pay for our expenses for the next two weeks. He’d spend it on frivolous knick-knacks or clothing, or sometimes blow it all on a night out with friends.

I always told myself it was okay though. He was good to me, and that’s all that mattered. He’s a good man, I thought. He’s a good man, Saman—

“Samantha.” His voice broke my train of thought.

I looked up at him, studying his face while he went on about how he’s sorry, and he’ll do better budgeting his money next check. I nodded periodically, his words nothing but a buzzing in my ears as I totally disassociated, watching his mouth move.

Just keep him happy, I thought again. Don’t start a problem.

That night I laid awake, biting my nails and staring blankly at the ceiling. Tristan was sleeping peacefully next to me. He was taking long, slow breaths and had the same peaceful look on his face he has when he’s fast asleep. He’d cough and wheeze periodically, sometimes getting into fits so bad that he’d wake up. Whenever that happened, I made sure to hold him tight.

Thoughts that were unwelcome in my brain came and went. I tried to ignore them as best as I could. In my struggle, I finally dozed off.

I woke up to the smell of breakfast. The kind that shouldn’t have existed in our kitchen: bacon, toast, eggs, and that sweet buttery aroma of something actually being cooked. I could hear a pan scraping against the stove. Something sizzling.

My face scrunched up in confusion. Tristan didn’t cook. Not because he didn’t want to, but because he was always too tired, or his back hurt, or his joints were locking up again. But this morning, he was whistling.

I sat up slowly. The room swayed a little when I did, like I’d gotten up too fast. I blinked the sleep away and rubbed my eyes till I saw spirals in my vision.

That’s when I felt it. My hand throbbed. Not the kind of ache you get from sleeping weird, or bumping into a doorframe. It was hot. Sore. I looked down and gasped quietly. A chunk of skin from the bottom right side of my palm was missing. Clean, almost surgical, like I’d slipped with a knife.

I didn’t remember doing anything like that. Surely I would’ve remembered nicking myself? The rawness had already scabbed over slightly, but the skin around it was red and irritated. I winced as I pressed down on the cut; it felt tender to the touch.

I stared at it for a long time.

Just a cut, I thought to myself. Nothing serious. Probably scratched it on something while I slept. Maybe the bedframe. Maybe my own nail. I honestly didn’t try to think about it too much. I chalked it up to being paranoid.

“Samantha?” Tristan called from the kitchen, voice bright and bubbly. “You up, baby?”

I smiled at him. “Yeah.”

He peeked his head in. He was already showered, his black hair damp, skin flushed with color. There was a sort of liveliness to him that hadn’t been there in weeks. Almost like someone had reached inside him and turned up the volume. Even his voice was clearer.

“You feel okay?” he asked. “You look a little pale.”

He gazed at me lovingly, his eyes full of concern and admiration.

“I’m fine, just tired.”

“Breakfast is ready.” He grinned.

God, I could never get over that smile. I’d give up all the money in the world just to see it.

“You’re in a good mood,” I mused.

He shrugged. “Woke up feeling great. Like, really great.”

He walked over and kissed my forehead. I caught the faint smell of aftershave and coffee on his breath. I absolutely loved seeing him like this, and it made me beyond happy that he was feeling better than usual.

He lingered a second. “I love you,” he said.

I swallowed. “I love you too.”

He didn’t ask why I kept my hand under the blanket.

I wore a hoodie that day. I tucked my bandaged hand inside the sleeve, telling Tristan I’d nicked it on a drawer handle. He didn’t just kiss the bandage, he gently took my hand in his, cradling it like it was something precious.

“You gotta be more careful, baby,” he said softly. His voice was warm. Genuinely concerned. He rubbed small circles into my palm with his thumb. And just like that, I felt the pit in my stomach shrink, even if was just a little.

Tristan seemed lighter that day. Happier. The usual dull pain in his back was gone like magic. He didn’t say it, but I could tell in the way he stood—straighter, less guarded. He even carried the groceries without making a sound.

“You look… good,” I said, watching him cautiously.

He smiled, almost shyly, and ran a hand through his hair. “It’s because of you.”

I felt a blissful, warm feeling in my chest. It was moments like that that made everything else worth it.

A week passed. Then another.

The wounds came back. Each morning, something new. A split lip. A scabbed patch behind my ear. A bruise on my ribs I couldn’t explain. Sometimes I could barely walk. It was honestly becoming debilitating, and I started to question my sanity.

I mean, how many times could I unknowingly hurt myself? The sentiment was a bit creepy, and I worried I was maybe blacking out and unintentionally hurting myself. I asked Tristan about it tentatively when we were curled up together on the couch or cuddled up in bed.

“Do you think maybe I sleepwalk? Maybe I’m hurting myself without knowing?” I was starting to get really worried. Nothing like this had ever happened to me.

He would frown and pull me in tighter. “I think you’ve just been stressed, baby,” he said once, brushing the hair from my face. “With everything you’ve been through… your dad, the shit from your past… it’s bound to show up in weird ways. Trauma is funny like that.”

That’s how he always brought it back. Never mean, exactly. Just… unsettling. The way he’d dance around the topic, but address it just enough to keep me calm. So I believed him. I took comfort in his words.

Then there were the other little things. The receipts I’d find crumpled in the trash. T-shirts, sneakers, a record player. Things he never showed me, never even mentioned. I think he noticed I was looking through the trash for receipts, because he started throwing them in the bin outside.

When I noticed that, a bubble of anger and resentment grew in my chest. I was only one person and holding the entire house down. I was the one paying our rent. Groceries. Car. Everything. Not to mention, he never took me out anymore. You’d think with all this newfound energy, he’d be a little thoughtful now and then.

Unfortunately, I had grown used to his behavior. When I confronted him gently, half-laughing to mask my nerves and soften the blow, he didn’t even deny it.

“Well, I mean… what do you want me to do?” he said, voice raising just slightly. “You make more money than me. I’m trying my best, Samantha. God. Why do you always have to make me feel like a fucking loser? Why is nothing I do ever enough for you? I’ve been through some awful things. Unimaginable. You’ll never understand me.”

I blinked back tears and tried to steady my breathing as he shouted at me.

“Tristan, I… I’m not trying to make you feel that way. All I’m asking for is a little help now and then.” My voice was shaky and fragile, laced with uncertainty and a painful fear of conflict and abandonment. “It’s hard doing everything alone.”

I expected him to pull me closer, to tell me everything was going to be okay. I should’ve known better. It was always a hit or miss with him.

There was a deafeningly loud bang as his fist broke through the bed frame. I jumped, heart racing out of shock and fear.

“You are privileged!” he roared. He looked at me with pure hatred and disgust. “I’ve been through far worse than you. And anything you did go through was your fault.”

He leaned in close to me, so close his lips were touching my ear. “Live with that.”

Shaking, I backed down. I always did. It didn’t matter what he said to me. I couldn’t bear to abandon him. He had a good heart. That I knew for sure.

That night, when he got home from work, he came into the bedroom crying, knelt beside me, and clutched my hand.

“I’m sorry. Look at me,” he said, cupping my face with his big hands. “I’m so sorry, Sam. I should never get like that with you. It’s cruel and disgusting. I just—I get scared sometimes, okay? I feel like I’m not enough for you. I project my own insecurities onto you and it isn’t okay. None of what I said is true. I’m a fuck-up.”

So I stayed.

The next injury was different. I woke up with a chunk of skin missing from the top of my thigh. A clean, raw circle. I nearly passed out when I saw it.

“What the hell?” I exclaimed.

Tristan found me in the bathroom, shaking. He didn’t panic. Instead, he wrapped me in a towel and whispered in my ear like it was all a bad dream.

“Baby, let me take care of you,” he murmured. He cleaned the wound with practiced hands.

“What’s happening to me?” I asked, voice breaking. “I think I’m falling apart.”

He looked me up and down, eyes full of admiration. “You’re not,” he said. “I’ve never seen you more beautiful.”

He kissed the wound. Then he kissed me. I melted into him, like I always did.

Then came the first time he called me a bitch. It was over money again. I had asked him not to spend our shared savings on a new watch. I wasn’t even mad. Just tired. Hollowed out. Drained.

“Oh, don’t start with that,” he muttered. “God, I swear you’ve been such a bitch lately.”

The words hit like a slap. He didn’t even look up from his phone. When I started to cry, he snapped at me and told me I was being sensitive.

Later, he said he didn’t mean it. That he didn’t even remember saying it.

He cried again. He told me he didn’t know how to love. That he hated himself and didn’t understand why I loved him so much. Why I stayed despite everything.

“I don’t want to be like the people who’ve hurt me,” he whispered. “I want to be good to you.”

And I said, “You are. You’re nothing like them.” Because part of me still believed it. Or needed to.

More time passed. The injuries deepened. Nerve damage. Fever. The cuts were more severe. And through it all, Tristan only seemed healthier. Glowing, even. His laugh was easier. His voice stronger. He started dressing better. Smiling more.

“You’re doing this,” he said one morning, placing a perfect hand over my ruined one. “I don’t know how, but you’re healing me. Thank you.”

The look in his eyes was soft. Grateful. It made my chest ache. Looking back, it should’ve been terrifying. I almost knew he had something to do with this.

One morning, I limped to our bathroom, panicking because of a searing, throbbing pain in my mouth. To my horror, my canine tooth was gone. It looked like it had been ripped clean off my gums. I screamed, shrill and raw, knowing no one could hear me because Tristan had already left for work.

In my panic, something caught my eye. There was a single piece of crumpled toilet paper in the trash can next to the toilet. I wouldn’t have looked twice at it, if it didn’t look like it was badly wrapped around something and tossed in there.

My stomach dropped.

I had to know the truth. I had been putting it off for far too long. I was definitely in denial. Blood roared and rushed in my ears as I bent down to pick up the paper. I unfolded it.

And there it was. My tooth.

That night I tried to leave. I gathered some of my things while Tristan was sleeping, trying desperately not to make a sound. I was halfway out the door when my vision tunneled. I collapsed. Something in me just gave out. My legs stopped working.

I woke in bed. My wrists were bandaged. My stomach was empty. I looked up and saw Tristan looking down at me, feeding me broth from a spoon.

He kissed my cheek. “You scared me,” he whispered. “Please don’t try that again. I can’t lose you. Not now.”

He sounded hungry. The mask was slipping. The warmth was still there, but behind it was something darker, greedy, and malevolent. Any fear I had was washed away by an overwhelming sense of exhaustion.

I woke up later in the night, feverish and head spinning, too weak to move. I saw him, just barely, crouched beside the bed, whispering something I couldn’t hear. He was crying. And laughing maniacally.

The next time I woke up, I couldn’t move.

The room was cold and still. Pain radiated throughout my body, so intensely that it almost felt numb. I used what was left of my strength to look down. I screamed—or thought I did. But nothing came out.

My arms and legs were gone. Even through my blurry vision, I could make out poorly done stitches where the rest of my limbs should’ve been. The skin around them was bright red and purple, and the wounds leaked pus.

I let out a weak moan, fear and adrenaline giving me just enough energy. Tristan was there. Calm. His voice was low.

“You’ve given me everything, Sam,” he whispered, brushing hair from my forehead. “I didn’t want it to be like this. I—I never meant to hurt you. I love you, you know that, right?”

I couldn’t nod. I couldn’t do anything.

He picked up the pliers.

“I just want to be whole. Like you,” he said, trembling. “You took care of me when I was at my worst. You stood by me even when I pushed you away. You didn’t let what you’ve been through overcome you. You achieved what I never could. Healing.”

He began removing my last two teeth, one by one. Each crack of enamel echoed like thunder in my skull.

And still, something in me broke open. An epiphany. The edges of my mouth trembled and contorted into a deranged, toothless smile. My gums were bloody. Nerves exposed. I started to shake in delight. Adrenaline rushed through my body like it never had before.

It didn’t matter how much he took anymore. In fact, if it was for the better of his health, I wanted him to.

“Take more,” I wheezed, using the last of my strength to speak.

“It’ll be okay, as long as you’re whole.”

My biological father died 15 years ago, and my mother remarried a year and a half after that. My stepfather was a real father to me, but after almost 12 years of marriage, he turned out to be a real jerk. My brother is openly trans, and my family is Christian, including me, my stepfather, and my mother. My mother and I accept my brother, piercings, tattoos, and all, but my stepfather hates him. He makes fun of my brother for studying law at university, calling him ""Your Honor"" to annoy him. 

Yesterday, my parents were arguing over a pharmacy bill. My stepfather accused my mother of buying things and putting them on his bill. My brother got angry with him, and they argued. My brother grabbed the knife, my stepfather grabbed a nearby coffee pot. My mother and I separated them and locked them in different parts of the house until things calmed down. But today, my brother freaked out at my mother, calling her a whore, a dirty slut who does anything for a man, and saying everything he's going through is her fault, that he hates her.

 I had to take and hide the knives, get him off the windowsill, and calm the situation.He scratched my arms as i held him back. My mother plays the victim and refuses to accept divorce advice because she's afraid of leaving my stepfather, who is already an elderly man and emotionally dependent on the jerk who humiliates her. I don't blame her; her life has been horrible since birth, and her head is screwed up too. But I also understand my brother; I know how he feels, boths sides have their reasons, and i just wish they'd come to terms and do something about it. My mom and brother are all i have, now i'm losing them too.

My mom has mental problems she doesn't accept, my brother is a suicidal traumatized person who is trying as hard as mom is, my stepfather is a emotionally abusive power figure and a fake deacon who plays nice inside the church when we're there.

To top it all, our finances are going down the drain, everything is messed up. 

I've been trapped in this terror for seven years, forced to eat it up  in silence ever since it all started.

I have no family around me or friends.
I also know that I’m pretty not much of a person so I’m asking for kindness and yes, I do believe that this is my choice and I’m not looking for a womp womp even though I’ll probably get it, I understand it though I also feel very small and in all honesty and probably a piece of shit who should just suck it up lol.
Here’s the run down I have been in a rocky position for years I feel like there’s no way out  I got very young kids to a man who is so mean to me and I have.
Here are some examples 
I perforated my eardrum and I woke up with blood and pus coming out of my ear.
I really needed to go to the doctors but he really wanted to have sex. I refused. Obviously I was in pain and he was so cold enough to not even let me take his car or even move the cars around so I had to walk all the way to the doctors after looking after a young child all night.
Another example, is that every time I have seem  to get a job  I’m always getting accused of cheating to the point where I actually believe that he wants me to cheat for some twisted reason.
Since the children have been born, I have hardly left the house. I have no friends now because his constant criticism and judgement has made me feel so small . I just don’t feel like making any anymore. 
Any time I bring up a hobby or something though I’d like to do I am met with unsupportive messages and discouraging language. And for somehow it always circles back to men. 
And just another example was when I came home from C-section of our last child he wouldn’t even give me the grace of being able to shower by myself. He had to allow my toddler to join me I ended up curling down in tears in pain because I had such a long labour that ended up in a Caesarian. All I wanted to do was wash my hair.
It’s crazy that I let myself get this way, but I was so young when I had met him.
His constantly ignored my boundaries with my bodily autonomy. 
I was also paying half of everything with a side hustle up until my last child was born.
When I was pregnant with my last child, he didn’t believe that I was in labour and he couldn’t even rub my feet or massage my back but yet expected his clothes to be folded and dinner to be cooked and toddler to be taken care of when I was heavily pregnant. And yes I still make sure that I did that and the needs of my other children were met.
He judges me for the way I dress and instead of saying that I look nice he always says what are you wearing.
I have done nothing but serve my children and serve him, but I’m getting to the point of breaking.
I constantly cook I constantly clean and every time he wasn’t comfortable with the job that I had gotten I’d quit every time he didn’t like an outfit I’d change to hell I even gave up my gym membership because of his hurt feelings that I was going to the gym and the fact that other men would be looking at me was making him feel strange.
He would tell me to make him lunch so I would, but then he wouldn’t eat it.
I will make him breakfast and coffee in the morning and I wouldn’t even get a thank you. I just a look saying suck my dick literally or he would say it. And the answer is always the same NO I have to look after children and then he has a sook
I do all the diaper changes all the feeds all the washing up all breakfast, lunch and dinners or the bathing so I’m pretty exhausted by the end of it.
And to me this is just all too strange. I don’t think this behaviour is appropriate but  this is my second ever relationship.
I’m still young and I don’t know what my next step will be. All I know is that being a good wife and a good mother will never be enough for a man.
At this point, my choices in life I just laughable and I don’t really know how to get out of this pickle that I’ve gotten myself into I could just kill myself, but I have a feeling that wouldn’t be too good for the children because I’m the primary caregiver and I love them and I want to see them grow up.
But leaving is going be hard it’s probably gonna be the hardest thing that I’ve ever done in my life because it’s the one thing that I never wanted to do.

If I leave, what does that entail? You know what I mean I have to go cross state lines to be able to afford to raise my children with a supportive network of my family.
My brain is always. How is that fair for him? And how is that fair for my children not to see their father when it’s so far away.

1mix1km,https://www.reddit.com/r/SingleDads/comments/1mix1km/not_sure_what_to_do_besides_family_lawyer_gf31/,"Not sure what to do besides family lawyer (GF31, Me44, Son4)","GF has history of mental health issues stemming back from 11yrs old when she lost parents and went from Aunt A to Aunt B. 

She has a record with police being called to Aunt B's. And eventually a restraining order.

She loves conspiracy stuff as do I for silly entertaiment but she really thinks shes heard voices in woods and seen Alien technology in the woods. At times when talking about things she doesnt want heard while we are driving mind u going 40+ mph to roll all the windows up, I do it to comfort her. Recently a sibling of hers that she cut off contact with her reached out to me cause she was concerned, it had been 2yrs since they last spoke and they talked for a bit and I heard a portion of convo as I was checking in on her about her going to the west coast with or without our son and after call GF tells me she thinks it was an AI call mind you I picked up the call on my phone and briefly spoke to her as I didnt have her blocked. She thinks it was an AI call trying to sex traffic her or her and my son...I told the older sister this later and she was very worried because the younger sister has bipolar and its suspected their mother did too. 

A lil time goes on and she starts having a melt down about not finding her phone and decides I hid it or took it and then ignores me and our son and reconnects with younger sister and they trauma dump and younger sister convinces her shes not mentally unwell its all her aunts and everyone else including me thats the problem. I spoke a little to older sister explaining that I need to possibly do something soon as back in March on St. Paddys day she started arguing with me and threw and lg iced coffee and hit me in chest and now has an open case that she got a plea deal to stay out of trouble for 6 months and she wont have to deal with the case. Also an open DCF case because of St paddys day attack on me.

Fast forward a lil and I get in contact with another family member who works in social services and they refer me to a clinician who works at local pd to come out to talk to her when shes having an episode. A few days go by and before me and the clinician can set up a day she starts spiraling and screaming in backyard I call cops as it was 11pm or 12a Saturday night they come out talk her down and she goes to bed and that morning(Sunday) starts screaming and I keep my son away as DCF has told me when she has these episodes.(We have dealt with DCF 3 times now) She wont calm down and I call the cops back out because now Im getting worried and stressed, we havent even started our day. They show up explain that a clinician will be coming out Tuesday and if she can calm down everything will be ok. Monday comes and she takes a walk like officer had suggested and because she said she had some calls to make regarding therapy, and her lawyer, comes back 5hrs later and shes telling me I need therapy too and I say well I have signed up for therapy too Im awaiting intake at moment.(I def need some help after dealing with her the last 5yrs) Then she got upset cause I brought up her doing more than talk therapy as shes told me in the past that they basiclally just affirm her beliefs that everyone is against her and abusive. 

Her family agrees theres something going on whether its bipolar or whatever she might need someone that can prescribe meds and help her unpack her childhood trauma. Next thing i know GF is on phone and police show up and and a few minutes later a uber shows up and I hear her older sister on phone and shes saying she got her a hotel....WTH is going on how is this going to help your sister by lying and claiming abuse and taking my son with her to a hotel. Its now 26hrs later and I havent heard from her and Ive been in contact with local pd cause they told me they would know where she is and make contact with her today, that didnt happen. 

A officer and the clinician she was suppose to talk to today did stop in and talk with me and they understand my concern and are going to contact the other police department that has a past with her and see what they have but as of now I havent heard from either officer or clinician if they made contact and Im worried sick and missing my son. I reached out to local pd tonight and was told the same officer and the clinician will be back in tomorrow and to make contact then. I just want to know they are both safe and would be awesome if I could see him as she had said in front of the officers before she left she would be back today Tuesday. 

Clearly shes up to something or her and sister are suddenly. Either way ive talked to a few lawyers today and most are 4k for retainer, but I think thats where this is headed. She only has 1 family member in state that would possibly take her and my son in but im confused how she thinks this is ok with an open dcf case. Ive updated DCF whats going on as well to keep them in loop and will be talking to them tomorrow. Havent slept much and have been on n off phone all day preparing for the worst. Didnt see this coming. Ive never hit her or been the reason why cops or dcf get involved. She has been declining and leaving everything up to me the last few months, cooking, cleaning and laundry. Side note, the officers on scene Monday night spent about an hour going back n forth on whether they were going to let her go and ask me if she would settle and I  said from experience doubtful because of everything that just took place and she doesnt have her proper dosages for Adderall, only has her afternoon dose rn cause of shortage. The officers then talk again amongst themselves and decide if im ok just for the night we let her go and she will be back tomorrow, and obviously that didnt happen.  Signing off and gonna go have nightmares. Miss my lil guy. Take care fellas!",1,1754460955.0,SingleDads,0,1.0,False

1miwzgg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1miwzgg/aio_and_i_feel_like_im_losing_it/,AIO and I feel like I’m losing it,"Does my boyfriend (26 M) care about what I (25 F) think?

I don’t know if our time has passed, or if we’re too comfortable, or if it’s something else. I feel like my boyfriend has gotten too comfortable and forgot that he still needs to put effort in our relationship. The beginning was good. Obviously there was that honeymoon phase. We’ve been together for 7 years. We met when I was in my last year of high school. We had our bumps at the beginning, mainly because we were also kids learning. However we’re both grown adults now. He’s very patient and caring. I’m not saying he is a bad boyfriend or a bad person. I just feel like I don’t feel that love anymore. I know he loves me but I dont feel like he’s IN love with me.

There’s little things here and there that hurt. For example, flowers, he rarely does it and I’ve brought it up. How to me it makes me feel loved. He always says he doesn’t do it because he rather take me out for coffee or movies etc. which is does a lot. And I APPRECIATE IT tremendously. However I’ve noticed he tends to love me in his love language - not mine. Ive voiced it many times. I’ve mentioned how and what makes me feel loved - but he just never does it. I feel like I’m just begging now and if he does ever get me flowers now, I just don’t feel the love from it. Something I would see and a simple yet loving gesture now looks like a “I had to ask for it and get in multiple disagreements to get this” :/ whereas I put the effort to learn how he enjoys to be loved and I do it.

Another is going out with friends or just adventures. I enjoy going out and having a good time outside of our home. Many times I go out with friends and I have attempted to invite him almost every time and he never wants to. It sucks because every time I go out for whatever with friends, I feel alone at the same time. Everyone has their significant other and then there’s me. A lot of times I get asked “where your boyfriend?” “Is he coming?” Etc. it’s always the same answer from me , “it’s just not what he’s into” I want to share experiences with him and introduce him into my world but he never seems interested. Idk am I being dramatic? It’s been 7 years and he’s only gone out w me about 3-4 times that involved my other loved ones (friends/family). He hated it every time. Always has a face or doesn’t try to put the effort in. To the point I’ve been asked if he was mad after the event. All those times he did go out, it’s been with different sets of people and he seems annoyed every time. He always claimed he was okay but it’s obvious he wasn’t. Like cmon, we’ve been together for almost a decade and live together. I know him as a person.

Another thing, I feel more love from him when I’m asleep. Let me explain. He works nights so by the time he’s off work, I’m asleep. There’s been many times where I wake up a bit when he comes say goodnight. When he says it, it seems very loving. Sometimes I pretend to be fully asleep just to feel that moment of love. When we’re awake, I just feel like we’re roommate. I don’t feel like he’s my boyfriend who is IN love with me.

Our relationship feels like it’s going into those where we’re just together now because we’ve been together for so long and it would be odd to not be simply because we’re comfortable. I used to be so excited for us. So happy. Now I feel lost. We have already had many talks about us but I still feel the same.

It’s almost midnight and I typed this like it was a diary so my apologies if some stuff sounds mixed or off lol

  The custodian at St. Mark's had just scraped three inches of snow off the sidewalks when the man with the cane appeared. The sun was up, but the winds were howling; the temperature was stuck at the freezing mark. The man wore only a pair of thin dungarees, a summer shirt, well-worn hiking boots, and a light Windbreaker that stood little chance against the chill. But he did not appear to be uncomfortable, nor was he in a hurry. He was on foot, walking with a limp and a slight tilt to his left, the side aided by the cane. He shuffled along the sidewalk near the chapel and stopped at a side door with the word ""Office"" painted in dark red. He did not knock and the door was not locked. He stepped inside just as another gust of wind hit him in the back.  
  
  The room was a reception area with the cluttered, dusty look one would expect to find in an old church. In the center was a desk with a nameplate that announced the presence of Charlotte Junger, who sat not far behind her name. She said with a smile, ""Good morning.""  
  
  ""Good morning,"" the man said. A pause. ""It's very cold out there.""  
  
  ""It is indeed,"" she said as she quickly sized him up. The obvious problem was that he had no coat and nothing on his hands or head.  
  
  ""I assume you're Ms. Junger,"" he said, staring at her name.  
  
  ""No, Ms. Junger is out today. The flu. I'm Dana Schroeder, the minister's wife, just filling in. What can we do for you?""  
  
  There was one empty chair and the man looked hopefully at it. ""May I?""  
  
  ""Of course,"" she said. He carefully sat down, as if all movements needed forethought.  
  
  ""Is the minister in?"" he asked as he looked at a large, closed door off to the left.  
  
  ""Yes, but he's in a meeting. What can we do for you?"" She was petite, with a nice chest, tight sweater. He couldn't see anything below the waist, under the desk. He had always preferred the smaller ones. Cute face, big blue eyes, high cheekbones, a wholesome pretty girl, the perfect little minister's wife.  
  
  It had been so long since he'd touched a woman.  
  
  ""I need to see Reverend Schroeder,"" he said as he folded his hands together prayerfully. ""I was in church yesterday, listened to his sermon, and, well, I need some guidance.""  
  
  ""He's very busy today,"" she said with a smile. Really nice teeth.  
  
  ""I'm in a rather urgent situation,"" he said.  
  
  Dana had been married to Keith Schroeder long enough to know that no one had ever been sent away from his office, appointment or not. Besides, it was a frigid Monday morning and Keith wasn't really that busy. A few phone calls, one consultation with a young couple in the process of retreating from a wedding, under way at that very moment, then the usual visits to the hospitals. She fussed around the desk, found the simple questionnaire she was looking for, and said, ""Okay, I'll take some basic information and we'll see what can be done."" Her pen was ready.  
  
  ""Thank you,"" he said, bowing slightly.  
  
  ""Name?""  
  
  ""Travis Boyette."" He instinctively spelled his last name for her. ""Date of birth, October 10, 1963. Place, Joplin, Missouri. Age, forty-four. Single, divorced, no children. No address. No place of employment. No prospects.""  
  
  Dana absorbed this as her pen frantically searched for the proper blanks to be filled. His response created far more questions than her little form was designed to accommodate. ""Okay, about the address,"" she said, still writing. ""Where are you staying these days?""  
  
  ""These days I'm the property of the Kansas Department of Corrections. I'm assigned to a halfway house on Seventeenth Street, a few blocks from here. I'm in the process of being released, 're-entry,' as they like to call it. A few months in the halfway house here in Topeka, then I'm a free man with nothing to look forward to but parole for the rest of my life.""  
  
  The pen stopped moving, but Dana stared at it anyway. Her interest in the inquiry had suddenly lost steam. She was hesitant to ask anything more. However, since she had started the interrogation, she felt compelled to press on. What else were they supposed to do while they waited on the minister?  
  
  ""Would you like some coffee?"" she asked, certain that the question was harmless.  
  
  There was a pause, much too long, as if he couldn't decide. ""Yes, thanks. Just black with a little sugar.""  
  
  Dana scurried from the room and went to find coffee. He watched her leave, watched everything about her, noticed the nice round backside under the everyday slacks, the slender legs, the athletic shoulders, even the ponytail. Five feet three, maybe four, 110 pounds max.  
  
  She took her time, and when she returned Travis Boyette was right where she'd left him, still sitting monklike, the fingertips of his right hand gently tapping those of his left, his black wooden cane across his thighs, his eyes gazing forlornly at nothing on the far wall. His head was completely shaved, small, and perfectly round and shiny, and as she handed him the cup, she pondered the frivolous question of whether he'd gone bald at an early age or simply preferred the skinned look. There was a sinister tattoo creeping up the left side of his neck.  
  
  He took the coffee and thanked her for it. She resumed her position with the desk between them.  
  
  ""Are you Lutheran?"" she asked, again with the pen.  
  
  ""I doubt it. I'm nothing really. Never saw the need for church.""  
  
  ""But you were here yesterday. Why?""  
  
  Boyette held the cup with both hands at his chin, like a mouse nibbling on a morsel. If a simple question about coffee took a full ten seconds, then one about church attendance might require an hour. He sipped, licked his lips. ""How long do you think it'll be before I can see the reverend?"" he finally asked.  
  
  Not soon enough, Dana thought, anxious now to pass this one along to her husband. She glanced at a clock on the wall and said, ""Any minute now.""  
  
  ""Would it be possible just to sit here in silence as we wait?"" he asked, with complete politeness.  
  
  Dana absorbed the stiff-arm and quickly decided that silence wasn't a bad idea. Then her curiosity returned. ""Sure, but one last question."" She was looking at the questionnaire as if it required one last question. ""How long were you in prison?"" she asked.  
  
  ""Half my life,"" Boyette said with no hesitation, as if he fielded that one five times a day.  
  
  Dana scribbled something, and then the desktop keyboard caught her attention. She pecked away with a flourish as if suddenly facing a deadline. Her e-mail to Keith read: ""There's a convicted felon out here who says he must see you. Not leaving until. Seems nice enough. Having coffee. Let's wrap things up back there.""  
  
  Five minutes later the pastor's door opened and a young woman escaped through it. She was wiping her eyes. She was followed by her ex-fiance, who managed both a frown and a smile at the same time. Neither spoke to Dana. Neither noticed Travis Boyette. They disappeared.  
  
  When the door slammed shut, Dana said to Boyette, ""Just a minute."" She hustled into her husband's office for a quick briefing.  
  
  \------  
  
  The Reverend Keith Schroeder was thirty-five years old, happily married to Dana for ten years now, the father of three boys, all born separately within the span of twenty months. He'd been the senior pastor at St. Mark's for two years; before that, at a church in Kansas City. His father was a retired Lutheran minister, and Keith had never dreamed of being anything else. He was raised in a small town near St. Louis, educated in schools not far from there, and, except for a class trip to New York and a honeymoon in Florida, had never left the Midwest. He was generally admired by his congregation, though there had been issues. The biggest row occurred when he opened up the church's basement to shelter some homeless folks during a blizzard the previous winter. After the snow melted, some of the homeless were reluctant to leave. The city issued a citation for unauthorized use, and there was a slightly embarrassing story in the newspaper.  
  
&  
nbsp; The topic of his sermon the day before had been forgiveness--God's infinite and overwhelming power to forgive our sins, regardless of how heinous they might be. Travis Boyette's sins were atrocious, unbelievable, horrific. His crimes against humanity would surely condemn him to eternal suffering and death. At this point in his miserable life, Travis was convinced he could never be forgiven. But he was curious.  
  
  ""We've had several men from the halfway house,"" Keith was saying. ""I've even held services there."" They were in a corner of his office, away from the desk, two new friends having a chat in saggy canvas chairs. Nearby, fake logs burned in a fake fireplace.  
  
  ""Not a bad place,"" Boyette said. ""Sure beats prison."" He was a frail man, with the pale skin of one confined to unlit places. His bony knees were touching, and the black cane rested across them.  
  
  ""And where was prison?"" Keith held a mug of steaming tea.  
  
  ""Here and there. Last six years at Lansing.""  
  
  ""And you were convicted of what?"" he asked, anxious to know about the crimes so he would know much more about the man. Violence? Drugs? Probably. On the other hand, maybe Travis here was an embezzler or a tax cheat. He certainly didn't seem to be the type to hurt anyone.  
  
  ""Lot of bad stuff, Pastor. I can't remember it all."" He preferred to avoid eye contact. The rug below them kept his attention. Keith sipped his tea, watched the man carefully, and then noticed the tic. Every few seconds, his entire head dipped slightly to his left. It was a quick nod, followed by a more radical corrective jerk back into position.  
  
  After a period of absolute quiet, Keith said, ""What would you like to talk about, Travis?""  
  
  ""I have a brain tumor, Pastor. Malignant, deadly, basically untreatable. If I had some money, I could fight it--radiation, chemo, the usual routine--which might give me ten months, maybe a year. But it's glioblastoma, grade four, and that means I'm a dead man. Half a year, a whole year, it really doesn't matter. I'll be gone in a few months."" As if on cue, the tumor said hello. Boyette grimaced and leaned forward and began massaging his temples. His breathing was heavy, labored, and his entire body seemed to ache.  
  
  ""I'm very sorry,"" Keith said, realizing full well how inadequate he sounded.  
  
  ""Damned headaches,"" Boyette said, his eyes still tightly closed. He fought the pain for a few minutes as nothing was said. Keith watched helplessly, biting his tongue to keep from saying something stupid like, ""Can I get you some Tylenol?"" Then the suffering eased, and Boyette relaxed. ""Sorry,"" he said.  
  
  ""When was this diagnosed?"" Keith asked.  
  
  ""I don't know. A month ago. The headaches started at Lansing, back in the summer. You can imagine the quality of health care there, so I got no help. Once I was released and sent here, they took me to St. Francis Hospital, ran tests, did the scans, found a nice little egg in the middle of my head, right between the ears, too deep for surgery."" He took a deep breath, exhaled, and managed his first smile. There was a tooth missing on the upper left side and the gap was prominent. Keith suspected the dental care in prison left something to be desired.  
  
  ""I suppose you've seen people like me before,"" Boyette said. ""People facing death.""  
  
  ""From time to time. It goes with the territory.""  
  
  ""And I suppose these folks tend to get real serious about God and heaven and hell and all that stuff.""  
  
  ""They do indeed. It's human nature. When faced with our own mortality, we think about the afterlife. What about you, Travis? Do you believe in God?""  
  
  ""Some days I do, some days I don't. But even when I do, I'm still pretty skeptical. It's easy for you to believe in God because you've had an easy life. Different story for me.""  
  
  ""You want to tell me your story?""  
  
  ""Not really.""  
  
  ""Then why are you here, Travis?""  
  
  The tic. When his head was still again, his eyes looked around the room, then settled on those of the pastor. They stared at each other for a long time, neither blinking. Finally, Boyette said, ""Pastor, I've done some bad things. Hurt some innocent people. I'm not sure I want to take all of it to my grave.""  
  
  Now we're getting somewhere, Keith thought. The burden of unconfessed sin. The shame of buried guilt. ""It would be helpful if you told me about these bad things. Confession is the best place to start.""  
  
  ""And this is confidential?""  
  
  ""For the most part, yes, but there are exceptions.""  
  
  ""What exceptions?""  
  
  ""If you confide in me and I believe you're a danger to yourself or to someone else, then the confidentiality is waived. I can take reasonable steps to protect you or the other person. In other words, I can go get help.""  
  
  ""Sounds complicated.""  
  
  ""Not really.""  
  
  ""Look, Pastor, I've done some terrible things, but this one has nagged at me for many years now. I gotta talk to someone, and I got no place else to go. If I told you about a terrible crime that I committed years ago, you can't tell anyone?""  
  
  \------  
  
  Dana went straight to the Web site for the Kansas Department of Corrections and within seconds plunged into the wretched life of Travis Dale Boyette. Sentenced in 2001 to ten years for attempted sexual assault. Current status: incarcerated.  
  
  ""Current status is in my husband's office,"" she mumbled as she continued hitting keys.  
  
  Sentenced in 1991 to twelve years for aggravated sexual battery in Oklahoma. Paroled in 1998.  
  
  Sentenced in 1987 to eight years for attempted sexual battery in Missouri. Paroled in 1990.  
  
  Sentenced in 1979 to twenty years for aggravated sexual battery in Arkansas. Paroled in 1985.  
  
  Boyette was a registered sex offender in Kansas, Missouri, Arkansas, and Oklahoma.  
  
  ""A monster,"" she said to herself. His file photo was that of a much heavier and much younger man with dark, thinning hair. She quickly summarized his record and sent an e-mail to Keith's desktop. She wasn't worried about her husband's safety, but she wanted this creep out of the building.  
  
  \------  
  
  After half an hour of strained conversation and little progress, Keith was beginning to tire of the meeting. Boyette showed no interest in God, and since God was Keith's area of expertise, there seemed little for him to do. He wasn't a brain surgeon. He had no jobs to offer.  
  
  A message arrived on his computer, its appearance made known by the distant sound of an old-fashioned doorbell. Two chimes meant anyone might be checking in. But three chimes signaled a message from the front desk. He pretended to ignore it.  
  
  ""What's with the cane?"" he asked pleasantly.  
  
  ""Prison's a rough place,"" Boyette said. ""Got in one fight too many. A head injury. Probably led to the tumor."" He thought that was funny and laughed at his own humor.  
  
  Keith obliged with a chuckle of his own, then stood, walked to his desk, and said, ""Well, let me give you one of my cards. Feel free to call anytime. You're always welcome here, Travis."" He picked up a card and glanced at his monitor. Four, count 'em, four convictions, all related to sexual assault. He walked back to the chair, handed Travis a card, and sat down.  
  
  ""Prison's especially rough for rapists, isn't it, Travis?"" Keith said.  
  
  You move to a new town; you're required to hustle down to the police station or the courthouse and register as a sex offender. After twenty years of this, you just assume that everybody knows. Everybody's watching. Boyette did not seem surprised. ""Very rough,"" he agreed. ""I can't remember the times I've been attacked.""  
  
  ""Travis, look, I'm not keen on discussing this subject. I have some appointments. If you'd like to visit again, fine, just call ahead. And I welcome you back to our services this Sunday."" Keith wasn't sure he meant that, but he sounded sincere.  
  
  From a pocket of his Windbreaker, Boyette removed a folded sheet of paper. ""You ever hear of the case of Donte Drumm?"" he asked as he handed the paper to Keith.  
  
  ""No.""  
  
  ""Black kid, small town in East Texas, convicted of murder in 1999. Said he killed a high school cheerleader, white girl, body's never been found.""  
  
  Keith unfolded the sheet of paper. It was a copy of a brief article in th  
e Topeka newspaper, dated Sunday, the day before. Keith read it quickly and looked at the mug shot of Donte Drumm. There was nothing remarkable about the story, just another routine execution in Texas involving another defendant claiming to be innocent. ""The execution is set for this Thursday,"" Keith said, looking up. ""I'll tell you something, Pastor. They got the wrong guy. That kid had nothing to do with her murder.""  
  
  ""And how do you know this?""  
  
  ""There's no evidence. Not one piece of evidence. The cops decided he did it, beat a confession out of him, and now they're going to kill him. It's wrong, Pastor. So wrong.""  
  
  ""How do you know so much?""  
  
  Boyette leaned in closer, as if he might whisper something he'd never uttered before. Keith's pulse was increasing by the second. No words came, though. Another long pause as the two men stared at each other.  
  
  ""It says the body was never found,"" Keith said. Make him talk.  
  
  ""Right. They concocted this wild tale about the boy grabbing the girl, raping her, choking her, and then throwing her body off a bridge into the Red River. Total fabrication.""  
  
  ""So you know where the body is?""  
  
  Boyette sat straight up and crossed his arms over his chest. He began to nod. The tic. Then another tic. They happened quicker when he was under pressure.  
  
  ""Did you kill her, Travis?"" Keith asked, stunned by his own question. Not five minutes earlier, he was making a mental list of all the church members he needed to visit in the hospitals. He was thinking of ways to ease Travis out of the building. Now they were dancing around a murder and a hidden body.  
  
  ""I don't know what to do,"" Boyette said as another wave of pain hit hard. He bent over as if to throw up and then began pressing both palms against his head. ""I'm dying, okay? I'll be dead in a few months. Why should that kid have to die too? He didn't do anything."" His eyes were wet, his face contorted.  
  
  Keith watched him as he trembled. He handed him a Kleenex and watched as Travis wiped his face. ""The tumor is growing,"" he said. ""Each day it puts more pressure on the skull.""  
  
  ""Do you have medications?""  
  
  ""Some. They don't work. I need to go.""  
  
  ""I don't think we're finished.""  
  
  ""Yes we are.""  
  
  ""Where's the body, Travis?""  
  
  ""You don't want to know.""  
  
  ""Yes I do. Maybe we can stop the execution.""  
  
  Boyette laughed. ""Oh, really? Fat chance in Texas."" He slowly stood and tapped his cane on the rug. ""Thank you, Pastor.""  
  
  Keith did not stand. Instead, he watched Boyette shuffle quickly out of his office.  
  
  Dana was staring at the door, refusing a smile. She managed a weak ""Good-bye"" after he said ""Thanks."" Then he was gone, back on the street without a coat and gloves, and she really didn't care.  
  
  Her husband hadn't moved. He was still slouched in his chair, dazed, staring blankly at a wall and holding the copy of the newspaper article. ""You all right?"" she asked. Keith handed her the article and she read it.  
  
  ""I'm not connecting the dots here,"" she said when she finished.  
  
  ""Travis Boyette knows where the body is buried. He knows because he killed her.""  
  
  ""Did he admit he killed her?""  
  
  ""Almost. He says he has an inoperable brain tumor and will be dead in a few months. He says Donte Drumm had nothing to do with the murder. He strongly implied that he knows where the body is.""  
  
  Dana fell onto the sofa and sank amid the pillows and throws. ""And you believe him?""  
  
  ""He's a career criminal, Dana, a con man. He'd rather lie than tell the truth. You can't believe a word he says.""  
  
  ""Do you believe him?""  
  
  ""I think so.""  
  
  ""How can you believe him? Why?""  
  
  ""He's suffering, Dana. And not just from the tumor. He knows something about the murder, and the body. He knows a lot, and he's genuinely disturbed by the fact that an innocent man is facing an execution.""  
  
  For a man who spent much of his time listening to the delicate problems of others, and offering advice and counsel that they relied on, Keith had become a wise and astute observer. And he was seldom wrong. Dana was much quicker on the draw, much more likely to criticize and judge and be wrong about it. ""So what are you thinking, Pastor?"" she asked.  
  
  ""Let's take the next hour and do nothing but research. Let's verify a few things: Is he really on parole? If so, who is his parole officer? Is he being treated at St. Francis? Does he have a brain tumor? If so, is it terminal?""  
  
 It will be impossible to get his medical records without his consent.  
  
  ""Sure, but let's see how much we can verify. Call Dr. Herzlich--was he in church yesterday?   ""Yes.""  
  
  ""I thought so. Call him and fish around. He should be making rounds this morning at St. Francis. Call the parole board and see how far you can dig.""  
  
  ""And what might you be doing while I'm burning up the phones?""  
  
  ""I'll go online, see what I can find about the murder, the trial, the defendant, everything that happened down there.""  
  
  They both stood, in a hurry now. Dana said, ""And what if it's all true, Keith? What if we convince ourselves that this creep is telling the truth?""  
  
  ""Then we have to do something.""  
  
  ""Such as?""  
  
  ""I have no earthly idea.""  
  
  CHAPTER 2  
  
  Robbie Flak's father purchased the old train station in downtown Slone in 1972, while Robbie was still in high school and just before the city was about to tear it down. Mr. Flak Sr. had made some money suing drilling companies and needed to spend a little of it. He and his partners renovated the station and reestablished themselves there, and for the next twenty years prospered nicely. They certainly weren't rich, not by Texas standards anyway, but they were successful lawyers and the small firm was well regarded in town.  
  
  Then along came Robbie. He began working at the firm when he was a teenager, and it was soon evident to the other lawyers there that he was different. He showed little interest in profits but was consumed with social injustice. He urged his father to take on civil-rights cases, age- and sex-discrimination cases, unfair-housing cases, police-brutality cases, the type of work that can get one ostracized in a small southern town. Brilliant and brash, Robbie finished college up north, in three years, and sailed through law school at the University of Texas at Austin. He never interviewed for a job, never thought about working anywhere but the train station in downtown Slone. There were so many people there he wanted to sue, so many mistreated and downtrodden clients who needed him.  
  
  He and his father fought from day one. The other lawyers either retired or moved on. In 1990, at the age of thirty-five, Robbie sued the City of Tyler, Texas, for housing discrimination. The trial, in Tyler, lasted for a month, and at one point Robbie was forced to hire bodyguards when the death threats became too credible. When the jury returned a verdict for $90 million, Robbie Flak became a legend, a wealthy man, and an unrestrained radical lawyer now with the money to raise more hell than he could ever imagine. To get out of his way, his father retired to a golf course. Robbie's first wife took a small cut and hurried back to St. Paul.  
  
  The Flak Law Firm became the destination for those who considered themselves even remotely slighted by society. The abused, the accused, the mistreated, the injured, they eventually sought out Mr. Flak. To screen the cases, Robbie hired young associates and paralegals by the boatload. He picked through the net each day, took the good catches, and tossed the rest away. The firm grew, then it imploded. It grew again, then it broke up in another meltdown. Lawyers came and went. He sued them, they sued him. The money evaporated, then Robbie won big in another case. The lowest point of his colorful career happened when he caught his bookkeeper embezzling and beat him with a briefcase. He escaped serious punishment by negotiating a thirty-day misdemeanor jail sentence. It was a front-page story, and Slone hung on every word. Robbie, who, not surprisingly, craved publicity, was bothered more by the bad press than by the incarceration. The state bar association issued a public reprimand and a ninety-day suspension of his license. It was his third entanglement with the ethics panel. He vowed it would not be his last. Wife No. 2 eventually left, with a nice check.  
  
  His life, like his personality, was chaotic, outrageous, and in constant conflict with itself and those around him, but it was never dull. Behind his back, he was  
often referred to as ""Robbie Flake."" And as his drinking grew worse, ""Robbie Flask"" was born. But regardless of the turmoil, of the hangovers and crazy women and feuding partners and shaky finances and lost causes and scorn of those in power, Robbie Flak arrived at the train station early each morning with a fierce determination to spend the day fighting for the little people. And he did not always wait for them to find him. If Robbie got wind of an injustice, he often jumped in his car and went searching for it. This relentless zeal led him to the most notorious case of his career.

1miwy4n,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1miwy4n/aita_for_cutting_off_my_friend_after_she_told_us/,AITA for cutting off my friend after she told us she was sending inappropriate pics to her mom’s boyfriend?,"I (19F) had a friend, let’s call her Sierra (also 19F), who I recently cut off, and I’m starting to question if I made the right call. We met back in high school, and while we weren’t super close at first, we got closer during senior year. We’d hang out during school breaks with mutual friends and sometimes outside of school, too.

After graduation, my life changed pretty drastically. My parents sold our house and moved to another country, so I had to quickly figure out how to support myself and find a place to live. I ended up in a rental with a truly awful roommate — but that’s a story for another time. During this chaotic transition, Sierra and I started hanging out more and growing closer. We’d go to parties, hit up clubs, and spend time with mutual friends. While I did enjoy the memories we made, I couldn’t help but notice that I was always the one putting in the effort. Whether it was organizing nights out or suggesting something as simple as a coffee hangout, it never felt like Sierra was invested in the friendship. Still, despite that and a handful of other red flags, I appreciated having someone to go out with, someone who was always down to make dumb, chaotic, college-aged memories.

Then, a few weeks before I left the country to visit my parents, something happened that I still can’t get out of my head. Sierra, our other friend Maya (also 19F), and I were driving to the beach when Sierra randomly started talking about her mom’s boyfriend. She was giggling and said something like, “My stepdad’s been asking me for bikini pics,"" and how he wanted pictures of her sticking her tongue out. There's more, but I don't want to/can't seem to remember the specifics of what she said beyond that.

Maya and I just stared at her like… \*what?\* And then Sierra laughed again and said, “Well, at least he gave me 20 bucks.”

I felt sick. I asked her if she was joking — she wasn’t. I told her while still in kind of a state of shock, “Sierra, that’s not normal. That’s not funny. Have you told anyone else?”

Instead of backing me up and trying to reason with Sierra, Maya stayed mostly quiet, and then even started to encourage her by saying stuff like, “Get that bag, girl,” and laughing along. Sierra just kept brushing it off, saying things like “It’s not that deep” and “I know what I’m doing.” She continued to tell us about how he is a sex addict, and while her mom knew she seemed to get... compensated... for her relationship with him, so according to her, that made everything okay.

That day, I tried to talk to Sierra seriously. I explained how disturbing and dangerous that whole situation was, and how messed up it was that she wasn’t taking it seriously. She’d nod like she was listening, but I could tell she didn’t get it. It wasn’t malicious; it was like she was stuck in this delusion that being sexualized by an older man made her feel powerful or wanted. She just didn’t grasp how damaging it really was. 

After I left the country to be with my parents, I made the decision to cut off the friendship. I stopped reaching out, stopped responding. I didn’t make a big, dramatic exit; I just removed myself from the situation. I also created a little distance with Maya because I felt like her response showed a serious lack of judgment, too.

But now that I’m back home, I’ve started to question if I overreacted. Maybe I should’ve handled it differently. Maybe Sierra needs help, not distance. And maybe I made things awkward with Maya when she was just… trying not to stir the pot.

Still, part of me feels like I did try to explain things, more than once, and neither of them seemed to take it seriously. I just didn’t want to keep surrounding myself with people who saw something that was concerning and laughed it off.



So… AITA for cutting them off? Or did I do the right thing for my own peace of mind?

We could start chatting and if we click, we could hop on to discord or whatever app or stay on Reddit, doesn't matter to me.

I love cooking, I could share some solid Turkish recipes with you. I game whenever I can on my free time so it's probably my most loved hobby, I play almost any genre but I can't stand moba or valorant type of games. I think they're just brain-rot games. I love Baldur's Gate 3, nowadays I'm on an evil run and even though it paaaains me to be evil it's so fun to play haha. I also play Project Zomboid, we just started it with my cousin recently. I'm waiting for BF6 open beta as well, pretty hyped for that. I also enjoy Arma Reforger somedays when I just want to lay in a bush and snipe people away. So that probably explains my taste in games, I like anything.

I love stationery and all things leather, mechanical and vintage. Rugged up, worn looks on anything interest me. I love wrist watches as well, we could talk for hours about them, watch videos, etc.

I love listening people's problems and giving advice, however I suck at following them myself lmao. I guess I'm a bit reserved and shy at the beginning but as we share our moments my jaw just drops. I can write paaaages of what's going on in my mind or talk about stuff for hours. I'm trying to be a self-taught front-end developer as well, which takes up the most amount of mental space in my head nowadays. If I'm too tired to think, it's most likely I've pushed out some good pomodoros.

I'm interested in snail mailing/penpalling as well, if you wanna try that out or are experienced already I'd love for you to guide me and we could do that as well, cause I'm not posting on penpals yet - I need to figure out delivery fees etc from my local post office.

I would appreciate if you're in for the long haul, although it's fine if you feel like we don't really click after a few days in, but please just let me know. I hate when people ghost, just typing out a few words to let them know you're not interested anymore is a lot nicer than just ignoring someone. Cause I would be messaging you to check on you.

I'm single, and hetero if that interests you.

The i3 has DDR4 8gb (1 slot) and my i5 has DDR3 8gb (2 slots) so I think the dual memory bandwidth plays a role here?.

I use the same version of CPU Z but the i3 8130 uses windows 11 while the i5 5200U uses windows 10.

So why is the i3 8130u slightly slower than i5 5200u, Despite being 3 generations ahead, having DDR4 memory, 1mb extra cache, more refined 14nm process? Is it because of binning? Silicon lottery? Is it because the i3 8th gen uses OPI which has lower speed than DMI 2.0? (4GT/s vs 5GT/s)? Is it because of the architecture? Or maybe CPU-Z reads it wrong.

Consider using soft whites, pastels, or light grays for walls and larger furniture pieces. You can then add splashes of color through accessories like cushions, artwork, or area rugs. This approach keeps the overall feel airy while allowing you to express your personality.

### Lighting Matters

Good lighting can entirely transform a space. Take advantage of natural light by placing windows strategically to invite the outside in. Use sheer curtains to maintain privacy without blocking sunlight. For evening ambiance, incorporate layered lighting, including:

- **Pendant Lights:** These can serve as both functional lighting and decorative pieces.
- **Wall Sconces:** These are perfect for creating a cozy atmosphere without occupying table space.
- **Floor Lamps:** Adjustable floor lamps provide targeted light and can highlight specific areas of your barndominium.

### Define Areas with Rugs

Rugs can help delineate different areas in an open space. Use large area rugs to anchor seating areas, creating a warm and inviting environment. Choose patterns and textures that complement your overall design theme to add depth and character to the room without making it feel cluttered.

### Personalized Décor

Your barndominium should reflect who you are. Consider using local art, vintage pieces, or family heirlooms in your décor. Unique decorations can tell a story and contribute a warm, personal touch. Additionally, mix materials like wood, metal, and glass to create visual interest and layers in your design.

### Outdoor Spaces

Don’t forget the exterior! Your barndominium can benefit from inviting outdoor spaces. Create comfortable areas for relaxation or entertainment, such as:

- **Porches:** A welcoming porch can serve as a transition from the outdoors to your interior.
- **Patio Areas:** Optimize them for grilling or lounging with friends and family.
- **Gardens:** Surround your home with native plants that require low maintenance and add natural beauty.

### Optimize Room Layout

Consider the flow of the in-door spaces. Arrange furniture in a way that promotes easy movement and accessibility. Establish clear walking paths to avoid a cramped feeling and ensure that spaces are not only stylish but also functional.

Designing and organizing spaces in your barndominium is about blending functionality with your personal style. By applying these practical tips, you can create a beautiful and efficient living space that meets your needs and reflects your unique aesthetic. Remember, the key is to make thoughtful decisions that enhance both the comfort and character of your home.

### Conclusion

Maximizing both style and space in your barndominium can transform your living experience into something truly special. By embracing creative interior ideas, such as utilizing open floor plans and incorporating multifunctional furniture, you create an environment that feels both spacious and welcoming. Think about using vertical storage solutions or strategically placing mirrors to enhance natural light.

Practical tips for organizing your barndominium play a significant role as well. Consider layout efficiency and flow in all areas of your home, from the kitchen to the living room. The use of color palettes and textures can also set the mood—whether you want a cozy, rustic vibe or a sleek, modern finish. Accessories like area rugs, throw pillows, and wall art can inject personality without overwhelming the space.

Remember, the key to a beautiful barndominium interior lies in balance. Combine stylish design with everyday practicality. By focusing on your specific needs and interests, you’ll create a space that not only looks great but also functions well for your lifestyle. Don't forget that the barndominium's charm often lies in its unique characteristics. Highlighting those features while maintaining design integrity gives your home an authentic feel, making it a place you’ll love to come back to every day. With the right approach, your barndominium can effortlessly blend style and functionality, creating a haven that reflects your personality and enhances your living experience.",1,1754458957.0,BarndosAndCabins,0,1.0,False

**AITAH for still getting on a flight home when my two young coworkers I was traveling with weren’t at the airport yet and were obviously going to miss it?**

TL;DR: Went on a work trip with two junior employees (not on my team) and they missed the flight home because they went sight-seeing the day we were leaving. I still got on flight even though they weren’t at the airport.

Long version -

This past week I was presented with an industry award in Nashville that an agency partner nominated me for. I am a Director at my company. My Co decided to send two junior-level employees to the event as well because they thought it would be a good experience for them - a Specialist who has been with us a little over a year (25f, first job out of college) and a summer intern (21f, rising senior). They are not on my team (report up through separate VP) and I have very limited / no interaction with them in daily work life.

They were VERY excited to be going. This was going to be the Specialist’s first time on a plane, lots of Teams chats asking what to wear, etc. We were flying in Thursday morning and leaving Friday evening so it was a very short trip, but I tried to help share info about the event (types of attendees, awards reception/presentation Thursday night with a country western theme, then I was speaking on a panel Friday morning).

There’s so much I could say, but I’ll try to highlight key points:

Specialist barely made Thursday AM flight because she doesn’t have a Real ID and had to do extra screening. She had no idea what a Real ID was, or the basic rules of flying (liquid restrictions, etc.) She was VERY upset they made her throw away some of her skincare that was over 3oz. Thurs night event was country western theme, and while a majority of people there were business casual, Intern shows up in a bandana tube top, micro skirt, cowboy boots and a cowboy hat. I pulled her aside and asked if she wanted to run upstairs and change since it was still a business event, but she said she was fine and she thought she looked cute and on-theme.

After ceremony I invite them to join me with some colleagues I knew from other Companies in the hotel bar, but they tell me they want to “check out Broadway”. I make a face and say this would be a good networking opportunity, they make “c’mon mom” jokes, and so I tell them to be safe and remind them the time and location of first session the next day. Text them around 11pm that I hope they got back safe, no response. Went to bed. Text them the next morning offering to meet them for coffee before morning sessions, no response.

No idea if they actually attended any sessions or saw my panel, but I did find them in the hotel lobby afterward looking incredibly hungover. Have about 2 hours after event is over and before we need to go to the airport, I invite them to late lunch with our agency partners. They decline because they want to go to the Country Music Hall of Fame. Again, make a face and say I don’t know if they will have time and I think it would be a good opportunity for them to spend time with our agency. They act like I’m the wet blanket so I tell them I’m leaving for airport from the hotel at 4pm sharp and meet me in lobby so we can share a Lyft. Text them at 3:45pm that Lyft is arriving in 15 mins, no response. Text them that Lyft has arrived and I’m leaving for airport, no response. Text them when I get to airport and tell them security line is long (neither had pre-check), no response.

Text them when I get to gate to please give me some sign of life, Intern sends very short response about 10 mins later: “In Lyft, there’s traffic.” Nothing else. Text them flight is starting to board, no response. Text them when I’m in my seat that boarding is about to end, no response. Doors close, they don’t make it, put my phone in airplane mode. Land a couple hours later to a barrage of texts from them. They’re “stranded in Nashville”, don’t know what to do, how to rebook, who to call for help, etc. I also have an angry voicemail from Specialist’s mom that I “abandoned her daughter in Nashville”, she has never flown and has anxiety, she’s having a panic attack at the airport and needs medical attention, she could be human trafficked (???). I call Specialist and Intern back, both phones ring but neither pick up. Text to see if they were able to rebook, no response. Forward them email with our business travel info with after-hours contact and text them that I sent the email, no response. Texted an hour or so later to see if they were okay, no response. Did not call the mom back.

Also have text from their Director (don’t know her well, just started with Co a couple weeks ago) asking what’s going on. I send her brief overview and screenshots of all my unanswered texts to them from earlier in the day along with the transcript of the vm I got from the mom. She acknowledges my response, but no further dialogue.

Now, I get an invite for a Monday morning meeting from that Director with their VP and our C-Suite leader. My VP is on PTO.

I feel like these are adults, I was communicative, and I’m ultimately not responsible for their decisions. But you tell me, AITA here?

**MissHibernia**

*I think that OP went incredibly above and beyond here considering that it was a WORK EVENT SHE WAS RECEIVING AN AWARD AT so to have these junior idiots causing any type of fuss was really an unnecessary hassle for her when it should have been a personal celebration*

>OOP: Okay thank you so much for saying this because I took it out of my main post since it was so long already, but I made a short acceptance speech after getting the award. I worked really hard on it and practiced a lot. It was only like 90 seconds but I asked Specialist and Intern to film it for me because I wanted to share it with my team members who helped me with it. Left my phone with them and everything but they “forgot” and that kind of upset me. It’s obvi not the end of the world but like, come on.

**Hari\_om\_tat\_sat**

*So they even failed at the only job you gave them with explicit instructions (“film my speech” — official speech at official event). Definitely worth including in your bullet points.*

**lychigo**

*You were there as their coworker, not as their mother. Firstly, no one should be expecting you to take care of them in that way. They're adults. And even when you did offer them direction and support, they didn't even have the decency to get back to you. And a call from her mom? Good Christ. I would come prepared with documentation and also let your supervisor know, even if they're on PTO that this is what was happening.*

**Mac1721**

*The call from her mom is what really gets me. As an adult, I fully understand calling your mom for help when you’re panicked, like this girl stuck at the airport with no flying experience. I would 100% call my mom if I were panicking in that situation. My mom, however, would help me get my shit together and clam down and solve the problem myself, not call another person on the business trip and yell at them for leaving me stranded. That far crosses the line*

**Apprehensive\_Mark\_20**

*They seem to have mistaken a business trip for a vacation. Also they acted irresponsibly around time, dressing, and networking possibilities. None of this is your fault. You are not their mother. You treated them like the adults they are, the fact that they didn't act like adults is not on you NTA.*

**RebeccaMCullen**

*After their behavior on this trip, I'll be surprised if they ever get a chance to go on another company funded trip, let alone still have a job.*

**fetgdry**

*Confirming you are female re the “c’mon mom” comment. This shouldn’t be, but is this a gendered issue that your company sent a senior female to do work and babysit two junior females?*

*I can understand never having flown before, but you went above and beyond to look after and help them. They aren’t you direct reports and frankly they didn’t do their job of actually benefiting from your experience and network. They took it as a chance to have a holiday.*

*If a colleague of mine was late, I wouldn’t be expected to miss my flight to help them. What you did was again above and beyond in trying to organise grown adults.*

*Re the meeting, if the people in attendance can impact your performance / bonus etc, I would strongly suggest emailing them to ask them what the meeting is about and reschedule when your VP is back.*

*If you don’t want to trouble your VP, I think that is fine also, but you should be prepared to make this an uncomfortable conversation for them as to why they think it’s ok to send two junior female employees to be babysit by another senior female employee. Would they expect this from a male colleague, my guess is probably not.*

*Good luck and update us!*

>OOP: Thanks for this comment. I don’t want to make this a gender issue, but if the meeting does turn on me on Monday I have been trying to find a way to professionally say, if it had been \[male counterpart on my team\] who went on this trip with the same outcome, would you be having the same conversation?

>Interestingly, perhaps, everyone on the meeting invite on Monday is a woman. My VP is male but on PTO so won’t be in attendance.

**Update - 1 day later**

**OOP replies in the crosspost from** r/redditonwiki **after the post was removed from** r/AITAH

(Insert “it’s meeeeee” Wicked meme here). This whole fiasco has really challenged my Reddit skills, lol. Here’s my update after my meeting this morning. If there is a better place/way to post it that won’t get me in Reddit jail, LMK:

Meeting over. CMO didn’t join. It was other VP and Director, plus the internship coordinator, who is in HR. VP asked all the questions. It was over Teams, on camera, recorded, almost comically formal, like I was being deposed or something.

During the meeting:

Was asked to recap what happened, starting from when we arrived. I was prepared, had all my key points. Kept it factual on my actions, no speculation on their actions.

I shared my phone screen live, went through the text messages with timestamps and the voicemail from Specialist’s mom.

I was asked if I had requested or encouraged Specialist to put any expenses on her P-card. This question took me by surprise. I said I didn’t even ask or consider that she had a P-card, and beside the Lyft from airport to hotel, which I scheduled/paid for, I was never outside of the hotel/official conference activities with either Specialist or Intern that would have required any sort of payment. I did say I would consider it to be her line manager’s responsibility to make sure she understood our travel and expense policies prior to traveling.

I was asked if at any point I had reached out to anyone at the office about anything that was transpiring, to which I said no, I certainly intended to when I returned, but we are talking about everything that happened within a 32-ish hour window, all while I was trying to focus on what I was sent there to do: participate as a panel member at the conference, attend other presentations, take advantage of face-to-face time with our agency, and accepting my award. I said I felt it was reasonable to believe any other attendees would have expectations for participation and outcomes set by their leadership team, especially when coming from another department, where I wouldn’t be knowledgable about their goals and objectives. Similarly, if there were different expectations of me based on other Co attendees, I would expect that to be clearly communicated in advance.

I was not asked if I thought Intern and/or Specialist should receive any sort of reprimand, and I didn’t feel comfortable trying to interject something like that based on the flow of conversation.

I’m under the impression that they’re meeting with Specialist and Intern separately, but my meeting was first.

After the meeting I debriefed with a trusted colleague, who shared the following from Friday “water cooler” chats:

I definitely offended Intern by pulling her aside about her outfit. She posted it to Snapchat with a caption about it, and some other interns/employees saw it. Dying to know what exactly it said, but coworker said everyone who did see it agreed it was inappropriate for a work event.

ALLEGEDLY Specialist’s mom had once called previous Director (who left, Director in meeting today replaced him) about Specialist’s working hours. It is known that several months ago Specialist was pulled off a high profile project team. Apparently when she was asked to put in some evening and weekend hours to meet a deadline, Mom called Director and complained. Don’t know if I believe this to be true but Mom stepping in could be a pattern.

What I’m hoping helps validate my “testimony” is separately on Friday, one of my agency partners I was with emailed my CMO about a conversation we had after the ceremony on Thursday evening with some ideas he had. Typical agency sales-y stuff, but he also unknowingly corroborated my alibi on Thursday night.

So, that’s where we are at. Last night I had convinced myself this all would result in me receiving a big apology or acknowledgment of wrongdoing, and that I shouldn’t have had to deal with this, etc. But I didn’t, which makes me feel this is still a bit unresolved. I did send all my notes to my VP on Sunday, but his PTO is medical related and I know he’s not able to really check in, so just keeping my head down until I hear anything else.

**Comments**

**chrisff1989**

*Sounds like they paid for random stuff using their company card and tried to blame you for it. I'd be shocked if they keep their jobs*

**MSK165**

*Thank you for this update. You won’t get an apology. That’s not how this works. One of the leadership may tacitly acknowledge that their behavior was wrong, but your involvement in this saga is over. My prediction: this is a career-limiting event for both of them. Intern will not be receiving an offer, and specialist will be terminated for using her P-card for unapproved items. (The termination will actually be for her helicopter mother, but on paper it’ll be for expense policy violations.)*

**ShaneRealtorandGramp**

*Nah, both will be fired for unprofessionalism during their trip with the additional violation for the specialist charging improper stuff as well.*

*The specialist is really screwed because she will lose out on income and benefits. The intern is probably still in college so she can go through entry level recruitment but it's still going to be a pain and its a small world so news of the interns behavior will spread. The punishments they are getting match with how much both of them fucked up*

Hurricane beers, by virtue of their purpose, frequently enough feature a higher-than-average alcohol by volume (ABV). This translates to a warming effect and a more impactful experience. You can expect ABV levels ranging from 7% upwards, sometimes even venturing into double-digit territory. This higher ABV needs to be balanced with flavor complexity to avoid simply being a boozy beverage.

**Bold Flavor Profiles**

A defining characteristic is the presence of assertive and richly developed flavors.

Styles like Barleywines, Imperial Stouts, and Belgian Quads frequently improve and evolve with age. Cellaring allows these beers to develop more nuanced flavors, frequently enough smoothing out harsh edges and promoting complex notes of oxidation that enhance the overall profile.

  I was drunk.  
  
  I wasn't entirely sure when it had happened, but I suspected it had occurred around the time my friend Doug had bet me I couldn't take down three vodka gimlets faster than he could. He'd promised to take my weekend shift at work if I won, and I was going to do his stock duty for a week if he won.  
  
  When we'd finished, it looked like I wasn't going to be working next weekend.  
  
  ""How did you out-drink him?"" my friend Hugh wanted to know. ""He's twice your size. ""  
  
  Through the crowd of people crammed into my condo, I peered at the closed bathroom door, behind which Doug had disappeared. ""He had stomach flu this week. I'm guessing that doesn't go so well with vodka. ""  
  
  Hugh raised an eyebrow. ""Why the fuck would anyone take a bet like that after having the flu?""  
  
  I shrugged. ""Because he's Doug. ""  
  
  Hoping Doug would be okay, I scanned the rest of my party with the pleased air of a queen sizing up her kingdom. I'd moved into this place back in July and had been long overdue for a housewarming party. When Halloween had finally rolled around, combining the two events had seemed like a pretty reasonable solution. Consequently, my guests tonight were clad in an array of costumes, everything from elaborate Renaissance fair quality garb to the slackers who'd simply thrown on a witch's hat.  
  
  Me, I was dressed as Little Bo Peep - well, that is, I was dressed the way Little Bo Peep would if she was a stripper and/or a shameless strumpet. My frilly blue skirt stopped just above the halfway point on my thighs, and my puff-sleeved white blouse was so low-cut that I had to be careful when leaning over. The crowning achievement - literally - was my curly mane of flaxen blond hair, neatly arranged into two pigtails tied with little blue bows. It looked perfect, absolutely indistinguishable from the real thing because. . . well, it was real.  
  
  Shape-shifting always came in handy as a succubus, but for Halloween, it was golden. I always had the best costumes because I really could turn into anything I wanted. Of course, I had to keep it within reason. Too much of a change would raise the suspicions of the humans around me. But for a hair change? Yeah. Shape-shifting was pretty convenient.  
  
  Someone touched my elbow. I turned, and my smug enthusiasm dimmed a little when I saw who it was: Roman, my sociopathic roommate.  
  
  ""I think someone's getting sick in the bathroom,"" he told me. Roman was a nephilim, half-angel and half-human, with soft black hair and sea-green eyes. If not for the fact he occasionally went on immortal killing sprees and had me on his hit list, he would have been a pretty good catch.  
  
  ""Yeah,"" I said. ""It's Doug. He lost a vodka challenge. ""  
  
  Roman grimaced. He wore devil horns and a red cape. The irony wasn't lost on me. ""Hope he's got good aim. I don't want to clean that up. ""  
  
  ""What, you don't do housework either?"" asked Hugh. He'd recently learned Roman wasn't paying me rent because he was ""between jobs. "" ""Seems like you should pull your weight around here somehow. ""  
  
  Roman gave Hugh a warning look. ""Stay out of this, Spiro Agnew. ""  
  
  ""I'm Calvin Coolidge!"" exclaimed Hugh, highly offended. ""This is the same suit he wore at his inauguration. ""  
  
  I sighed. ""Hugh, nobody here remembers that. "" That was one of the downsides of being immortal. Our memories became obsolete as more time passed. Hugh, an imp who bought souls for Hell, was much younger than Roman and me, but he had a lot more years than any human here.  
  
  Slipping away from Roman and Hugh's argument, I headed across the room to mingle with my guests. Some of my coworkers from the bookstore Doug and I worked at were huddled around the punch bowl, and I stopped to chat. Immediately, I was bombarded with compliments.  
  
  ""Your hair is amazing!""  
  
  ""Did you dye it?""  
  
  ""It doesn't even look like a wig!""  
  
  I assured them it was a very good wig and dealt out praise for them in return. One person, however, earned a rueful head-shake from me.  
  
  ""You have more creativity than all of us put together, and that's the best you could do?"" I asked.  
  
  Best-selling author Seth Mortensen turned to look at me with one of his trademark, slightly scattered smiles. Even when I was dizzy with vodka, that smile never failed to make my heart speed up. Seth and I had dated for a while, plunging me into the depths of a love I'd never imagined possible. Part of being a succubus was an eternity of seducing men and stealing the energy of their souls - a real relationship had seemed out of the question. And in the end, it had been. Seth and I had broken up - twice - and while I usually accepted that he had moved on, I knew that I would love him forever. For me, forever was a serious matter.  
  
  ""I can't waste it on a costume,"" he said. His amber-brown eyes regarded me fondly. I no longer knew if he loved me too; I only knew for sure that he still cared about me as a friend. I kept trying to portray the same image. ""Gotta save it for the next book. ""  
  
  ""Lame excuse,"" I said. His shirt depicted Freddy Krueger, which might have been acceptable if not for the fact I suspected he had owned it long before Halloween.  
  
  Seth shook his head. ""Nobody cares what guys wear at Halloween anyway. It's all about the women. Look around. "" I did and saw that he was right. All the elaborate, sexy costumes were on my female guests. With a few exceptions, the men's dulled by comparison.  
  
  ""Peter's dressed up,"" I pointed out. Seth followed my gaze to another of my immortal friends. Peter was a vampire, a very fastidious and obsessive-compulsive one. He was clad in pre-Revolutionary French garb, complete with brocade coat and a powdered wig over what was normally thin brown hair.  
  
  ""Peter doesn't count,"" said Seth.  
  
  Recalling how Peter had painstakingly stenciled swans around his bathroom's baseboards last week, I couldn't help but agree. ""Fair point. ""  
  
  ""What's Hugh supposed to be? Jimmy Carter?""  
  
  ""Calvin Coolidge. ""  
  
  ""How can you tell?""  
  
  I was saved from answering when Seth's fianc¨  
  
  e - and one of my best friends - Maddie Sato appeared. She was dressed as a fairy, complete with wings and a gauzy dress nowhere near as slutty as mine. Fake flowers wreathed black hair that had been pulled into a bun. Her being with Seth was something else I'd more or less come to accept, though I suspected the sting of it would never leave. Maddie didn't know Seth and I had dated and had no clue about the discomfiture I felt over their whole relationship.  
  
  I expected her to slip her arm around Seth, but it was me she grabbed hold of and jerked away. I stumbled a bit. Five-inch heels weren't normally a problem for me, but the vodka complicated things a bit.  
  
  ""Georgina,"" she exclaimed, once we were far enough away from Seth. ""I need your help. "" Reaching into her purse, she pulled out two pages torn from magazines.  
  
  ""With wha - oh. "" My stomach twisted uncomfortably, and I hoped I wouldn't be joining Doug in the bathroom. The pages showed photos of wedding dresses.  
  
  ""I've almost narrowed it down,"" she explained. ""What do you think?""  
  
  Grudgingly accepting the man I loved was going to marry one of my best friends was one thing. Helping them plan their wedding was an entirely different matter. I swallowed.  
  
  ""Oh, gee, Maddie. I'm not very good at this stuff. ""  
  
  Her dark eyes widened. ""Are you kidding? You're the one who taught me how to dress right in the first place. ""  
  
  She apparently hadn't taken the lessons to heart. The dresses, while beautiful on the anorexic models wearing them, would look terrible on Maddie. ""I don't know,"" I said lamely, dragging my eyes away. The dresses were conjuring mental images of Maddie and Seth walking down the aisle together.  
  
  ""Come on,"" she entreated. ""I know you have an opinion. ""  
  
  I did. A bad one. And honestly, if I were a good servant of Hell, I wou  
ld have told her they both looked great. Or I would have endorsed the worst one. What she wore was no concern of mine, and maybe if she showed up at her wedding looking subpar, Seth would realize what he'd lost when we broke up.  
  
  And yet. . . I couldn't. Even after everything that had happened, I just couldn't let Maddie do it. She'd been a good friend, never suspecting what had occurred between Seth and me before and during their relationship. And as much as that petty, selfish part of me wanted it, I couldn't let her go forward in a bad dress.  
  
  ""Neither are good,"" I said at last. ""The full skirt on that one will make you look short. The flowers on top of that one will make you look fat. ""  
  
  She was taken aback. ""Really? I never. . . "" She studied the pictures, face falling. ""Damn. I thought I had this stuff down now. ""  
  
  I can only assume my next words came from the liquor. ""If you want, I'll go with you to some places this week. You can try some stuff on, and I'll tell you what works. ""  
  
  Maddie lit up. She wasn't gorgeous in the popular, magazine sort of way, but when she smiled, she was beautiful. ""Really? Oh, thank you. And you can look for your dress too. ""  
  
  ""My what?""  
  
  ""Well. . . "" Her smile turned sly. ""You're going to be a bridesmaid, aren't you?""  
  
  At that moment, I reconsidered my earlier thoughts about nothing being more painful than helping plan her wedding. Being her bridesmaid pretty much blew that out of the water. Those who believed we made our own hells on earth must have had something like this in mind.  
  
  ""Oh, well, I don't know. . . ""  
  
  ""You have to! There's no one else I'd rather have. ""  
  
  ""I'm not really the bridesmaid type. ""  
  
  ""Of course you are. "" Maddie's eyes suddenly looked at something beyond me. ""Oh, hey. Doug's back. I'm going to go check on him. We'll talk about this later. You'll give in. "" Maddie scurried off to her brother, leaving me numb and speechless. I decided then it was worth risking illness to go get another drink. This party had taken a definite U-turn.  
  
  Yet, when I turned around, it wasn't toward the bar. It was toward my patio. One of the best features of this condo was its expansive balcony, one that looked out over Puget Sound and the Seattle skyline beyond. As I stood there, though, it wasn't the view that captivated me. It was. . . something else. Something I couldn't explain. But it was warm and wonderful and spoke to all my senses. I imagined I could see colored light on my balcony, kind of like the waves of an aurora. I could also hear a type of music that defied all human words and had nothing to do with the Pink Floyd blasting from my stereo.  
  
  The party faded into the background as I slowly moved toward the balcony. The door was open to air out the hot room, and my two cats, Aubrey and Godiva, lay near it to look outside. I stepped past them, drawn toward that which had no explanation or description. Warm autumn air engulfed me as I groped for what called me. It was all around me and yet out of my reach. It was summoning me, drawing me toward something right on the balcony's edge. I almost considered climbing on the ledge in my heels and looking over. I had to reach that beauty.  
  
  ""Hey, Georgina. ""  
  
  Peter's voice jerked me out of the trance. I stared around, startled. There was no music, no color, no beckoning embrace. Only the night and the view and the patio furniture on my balcony. I turned around, meeting his eyes.  
  
  ""We have a problem,"" he said.  
  
  ""We have a lot of problems,"" I said, thinking of Maddie's wedding dress and the fact that I'd nearly walked off my own balcony. I shivered. I definitely was not going back for that next drink. Sick was one thing. Hallucinations were another. ""What's wrong?""  
  
  Peter led me inside and pointed. ""Cody's in love. ""  
  
  I looked over at our friend Cody, another vampire and Peter's apprentice. Cody was a young immortal, optimistic and endearing. He was dressed as an alien, with green antennae sticking out of his shaggy blond hair. The perfection of his silvery space suit made me think Peter had played a role. Right now, Cody was staring across the room, mouth open as he gazed at someone. He looked like I had felt just moments ago.  
  
  Her name was Gabrielle, and she'd just started working at the bookstore. She was tiny, almost pixie like, and wore black fishnets and a ripped black dress. Her spiky hair was also black, as was her lipstick. Easy coordination. Cody was staring at her like she was the most beautiful creature on earth.  
  
  ""Huh,"" I said. Hugh dated all the time, but I'd never really thought of the vampires - particularly Peter - having any sort of romantic interactions.  
  
  ""I think he likes that she's dressed as a vampire,"" said Peter.  
  
  I shook my head. ""Actually, that's how she always dresses. ""  
  
  We walked over to Cody, and it took him several moments to notice us. He seemed excited to see me. ""What's her name?"" he breathed.  
  
  I tried to hide my smile. Cody being smitten was one of the cutest things I'd ever seen and a welcome distraction from the other drama tonight. ""Gabrielle. She works at the store. ""  
  
  ""Is she single?""  
  
  I looked back at her as she laughed at something Maddie had said. ""I don't know. Want me to find out?""  
  
  Cody blushed - in as much as a pale vampire could. ""No! I mean. . . unless you think it wouldn't be too obvious? I don't want you to go to any trouble. ""  
  
  ""No trouble for me,"" I said, just as Doug walked by. ""Hey. "" I caught hold of his sleeve. ""Do me a favor, and I'll take my shift back. ""  
  
  Doug, whose Japanese-American skin was normally golden tan, could have also currently passed for an alien with his green hue. ""I'd rather have my stomach back, Kincaid. ""  
  
  ""Go investigate Gabrielle's romantic status. Cody's interested. ""  
  
  ""Georgina!"" exclaimed Cody, mortified.  
  
  Sick or not, Doug couldn't resist a little intrigue. ""Sure thing. ""  
  
  He headed off across the room and pulled Gabrielle to him, leaning down so she could hear. At one point, he glanced over toward us, and Gabrielle looked as well. Cody nearly died.  
  
  ""Oh God. ""  
  
  Doug returned five minutes later and shook his head. ""Sorry, kid. She's single, but she doesn't think you're her type. She's into the Goth and vampire scene. You're too mainstream for her. "" I was sipping a glass of water and nearly choked on it.  
  
  ""That,"" said Peter, as soon as Doug was gone, ""is what we call irony. ""  
  
  ""How is that possible?"" exclaimed Cody. ""I am a vampire. I should be exactly what she wants. ""  
  
  ""Yeah, but you don't look like one,"" I said. If Gabrielle had been a Trekkie, he might have had a shot tonight.  
  
  ""I look exactly like a vampire because I am one! What should I dress up as? Count Chocula?""  
  
  The party continued in force for another couple hours, and finally, people began trickling out. Roman and I, playing good hosts, smiled and bade each of them farewell. By the time everyone left, I was weary and more than happy for it all to be over. I'd refused to drink after the balcony incident and now had a headache as a pleasant reminder of my indulgences. Roman looked as exhausted as me as he scanned the messy condo.  
  
  ""Funny, huh? You throw a housewarming party to show the place off, and then people trash it. ""  
  
  ""It'll clean up fast,"" I said, studying all the bottles and paper plates with remnants of food. Aubrey was licking frosting off a half-eaten cupcake, and I hastily took it away from her. ""But not tonight. Help me take care of the perishables, and we'll do the rest tomorrow. ""  
  
  ""There's no 'we' in 'clean,'"" Roman said.  
  
  ""That doesn't even make sense,"" I said, covering up some salsa. ""And Peter's right, you know. You really should do more around here. ""  
  
  ""I provide good company. Besides, how can you get rid of me?""  
  
  ""I'll get Jerome to,"" I warned, referring to his demon father, who also happened to be my boss.  
  
  ""Sure. Run off and tell on me. "" Roman stifled a yawn, demonstrating just how worried he was about his father's wrath. The annoying part was, he had a point. I couldn't get rid of him on my own, and I doubted Jerome would really help. Still, I  
could hardly believe it when Roman did wander off to bed and leave me alone with the cleanup. I hadn't thought he'd go that far.  
  
  ""Asshole!"" I yelled after him, getting only a slammed door in response. He really wasn't that bad of a roommate, but our troubled past often made him want to annoy me. It worked.  
  
  Fuming, I finished the necessary tidying and dropped into bed a half-hour later. Aubrey and Godiva followed me, lying side by side at the end of the bed. They were a contrast in colors, like some piece of modern art. Aubrey was white with black specks on her head; Godiva was a riot of orange, brown, and black patches. All three of us drifted off to sleep immediately.  
  
  Sometime later, I woke to the sound of singing. . . or, well, that was the closest I could come to describing it. It was the same thing I'd felt earlier, an alluring, haunting pull that spoke to every part of me. Warm and bright and beautiful. It was everywhere and everything, and I longed to have more of it, to walk toward the light that shone with indescribable colors. It felt so, so good - like something I could melt into, if only I could reach it. I had the impression of an entrance, a door I simply had to push open and step through and -  
  
  Rough hands gripped my shoulders and jerked me around. ""Wake up!""  
  
  Like before, the sensory overload vanished. I was left alone in a quiet, empty world. No more siren song. Roman stood in front of me, hands shaking me as his face stared down at me with worry. I looked around. We were in the kitchen. I had no memory of getting there.  
  
  ""How - what happened?"" I stammered.  
  
  The face that had taunted me earlier was now filled with concern, something that troubled a small part of me. Why should someone who wanted to kill me be worried about me?  
  
  ""You tell me,"" he said, releasing his grip.  
  
  I rubbed my eyes, willing myself to recall what had happened. ""I. . . I don't know. I must have sleepwalked. . . . ""  
  
  His face was still drawn and anxious. ""No. . . there was something here. . . . ""  
  
  I shook my head. ""No, it was a dream. Or a hallucination. I had it happen earlier. . . . I just drank too much. ""  
  
  ""Didn't you just hear me?"" There it was again, fear for me underneath the anger. ""There was something here, some. . . force. I felt it. It woke me up. Don't you remember anything at all?""  
  
  I stared off, trying to summon up the light and haunting melody. I couldn't. ""It was. . . it was exquisite. I wanted. . . I wanted to go to it. . . to be part of it. . . "" There was a dreamy, wistful note in my voice.  
  
  Roman's expression grew dark. As a succubus, I was a lesser immortal, one who had once been human. Greater immortals, like angels and demons, had been created at the universe's beginning. Nephilim were born and fell somewhere in the middle. As such, their powers and senses were greater than mine. Roman could detect things I couldn't.  
  
  ""Don't,"" he said. ""You feel it again, you pull away. Don't let it draw you in. Under no circumstances should you go to it. ""  
  
  I looked back at him with a frown. ""Why? Do you know what it is?""  
  
  ""No,"" he said grimly. ""And that's the problem. 

Chapter 2  
  
   
  
  I tossed and turned the rest of the night. Being visited by a weird supernatural force will do that to you. Besides, I had never fully recovered from the time an ¨¹ber-powerful entity of chaos had merged with me in my sleep and sucked away my energy. Her name was Nyx, and last I'd heard, she was imprisoned. Still, what she'd done to me - and what she'd shown me - had left a lasting impression. The fact that Roman couldn't identify what had happened tonight was a little unnerving.  
  
  So, I woke up bleary-eyed, sporting a massive headache that was probably equal parts hangover and sleep deprivation. Succubi had the rapid healing that all immortals possessed, which meant I must have seriously screwed myself up to have these lingering effects. I knew the headache would pass soon, but I took some ibuprofen to help the process.  
  
  The condo was quiet when I shuffled into the kitchen, and despite my efforts to clean up the food last night, I was still surrounded in the tattered and worn-out feel that followed most parties. Godiva, curled up on the back of the couch, lifted her head at my arrival, but Aubrey continued sleeping undisturbed in her spot on an armchair. I started some coffee and then wandered over to my patio, staring out at the sunny day and the Seattle skyline on the other side of the gray-blue water stretching off before me.  
  
  A familiar sensation suddenly swept me, like brimstone and red-hot needles. I sighed.  
  
  ""Kind of early for you, isn't it?"" I asked, not needing to turn around to know Jerome, archdemon of the greater Seattle area and my hellish boss, stood behind me.  
  
  ""It's noon, Georgie,"" he replied dryly. ""The rest of the world is up and around. ""  
  
  ""It's Saturday. The laws of time and space are different today. Noon qualifies as early. ""  
  
  I turned around at last, largely because I'd heard the coffee-maker finish. Jerome was leaning against my kitchen wall, immaculately dressed as always in a black designer suit. Also, like always, the demon looked exactly like a circa 1990s version of John Cusack. He could appear as anything or anyone he wanted in this world, but for reasons he kept vague, Mr. Cusack was his preferred shape. I'd gotten so used to it that whenever Say Anything or Grosse Pointe Blank came on TV, I always had to pause and ask myself, ""What's Jerome doing in this movie?""  
  
  I poured a cup of coffee and held up the pot by way of invitation. Jerome shook his head. ""I suppose,"" he said, ""your roommate is also being a sloth and isn't actually out running errands?""  
  
  ""That'd be my guess. "" I doused my coffee liberally with vanilla creamer. ""I used to kind of hope that when he wasn't around, it meant he was out looking for a job. Turns out I was just setting myself up for disappointment. ""  
  
  Honestly, I was glad it was Roman that Jerome had come to see. When Jerome was looking for me, no good ever came of it. It always tended to result in some traumatic, world-threatening event in the immortal underground.  
  
  I trudged back across the living room, noting that the cats had disappeared upon Jerome's arrival. Coffee still in hand, I headed to Roman's room, knocking once before opening the door. I figured as landlady, I had that right. Also, I'd found Roman had a remarkable ability to ignore knocking for large amounts of time.  
  
  He was sprawled across his bed, wearing only a pair of navy blue boxers that gave me pause. As I'd noted before, he was terribly good-looking, despite the prickly attitude he'd had since moving in. Seeing him half-dressed always gave me a weird flashback to the one time we'd slept together. Then, I'd have to remind myself that he was probably plotting how to kill me. It went a long way to stifle any residual lust.  
  
  Roman's arm covered his eyes against the sunlight streaming through his window. He shifted, moving the arm slightly, and peered at me with one eye. ""It's early,"" he said.  
  
  ""Not according to your exalted sire. ""  
  
  A few seconds passed, and then he grimaced as he too sensed Jerome's immortal signature. With a sigh, Roman sat up, pausing to rub his eyes. He looked about as exhausted as I felt, but if there was one force in this world that could drag him out of bed after a late night, it was my boss - no matter Roman's bold claims from last night. He staggered to his feet and moved past me in the doorway.  
  
  ""Aren't you going to get dressed?"" I exclaimed.  
  
  Roman's only answer was a disinterested wave of his hand as he headed down the hall. I followed him back and discovered Jerome pouring himself a mug of some vodka leftover from last night. Well, it was five o'clock somewhere. He arched an eyebrow when he saw Roman's scantily clad state.  
  
  ""Nice of you to dress up. ""  
  
  Roman made a beeline for the coffee. ""Only the best for you, Pop. Besides, Georgina likes it. ""  
  
  A moment of heavy silence followed as Jerome's dark eyes studied Roman. I knew nothing about Roman's mother, but Jerome was the demon who had fathered him thousands of years ago. Technically, Jerome had been an angel at the time, but making the moves on a human had got him fired from Heaven and sent off to work for those down below. No severance package.  
  
  Roman occasionally made snide comments about their familial relationship, but Jerome never acknowledged it. In fact, according to both Heaven and Hell's rules, Jerome should have blasted Roman from the earth ages ago. Angels and demons considered nephilim unnatural and wrong and continually attempted to hunt them to extinction. It was kind of harsh, even with the sociopathic tendencies nephilim tended to have. Roman had been instrumental in saving Jerome recently, however, and the two had struck a deal that allowed Roman to live peacefully in Seattle - for now. If any of Jerome's colleagues found out about this illicit arrangement, there would literally be hell to pay - for all of us. A good succubus would have told on her rule-breaking boss.  
  
  ""So what brings you here?"" asked Roman, pulling up a chair. ""Want to toss the old football around?""  
  
  Jerome's face remained impassive. ""I have a job for you. ""  
  
  ""Like one that pays the rent?"" I asked hopefully.  
  
  ""Like one that ensures I'll continue to allow him to live in the lifestyle he's accustomed to,"" replied Jerome.  
  
  Roman had an amused, devil-may-care smile on his face that was typical of him, but I wasn't fooled. He knew the threat Jerome represented and also knew that part of their deal involved Roman doing errands for his father. Still, Roman made a good show of acting like he was the one doing Jerome a favor. The nephilim gave an unconcerned shrug.  
  
  ""Sure. I've got nothing else going on today. What's up?""  
  
  ""We have a new immortal visitor in town,"" said Jerome. If Roman's attitude annoyed him, the demon was just as good at masking his feelings. ""A succubus. ""  
  
  My removed, psychological study of father and son dynamics came to a screeching halt. ""What?"" I exclaimed, straightening up so quickly that I nearly spilled my coffee. ""I thought we were set after Tawny. ""  
  
  I'd worked the succubus scene solo around here for years until Jerome had acquired another one several months ago. Her name was Tawny, and while she was annoying and pretty inept as succubi went, there was still something rather endearing about her. Fortunately, Jerome had sent her off to Bellingham, keeping her a comfortable hour-and-a-half drive from me.  
  
  ""Not that it's any of your business, Georgie, but this one's not here to work. She's here. . . as a visitor. On vacation. "" Jerome's lips twisted with bitter amusement.  
  
  Roman and I exchanged looks. Immortals could certainly take personal vacations, but clearly, there was more to this.  
  
  ""And?"" asked Roman. ""She's really here because. . . ?""  
  
  ""Because I'm sure my superiors want to check up on me after the recent. . . incident. ""  
  
  His words were delicate, with a very subtle warning not to elaborate on said incident. It was the one Roman and I had rescued him from - a summoning that had imprisoned Jerome as part of a demonic power play. Letting yourself get summoned was embarrassing for a demon and could call his territorial control into question. Hell sending someone to survey the situation wasn't that crazy.  
  
  ""You think she's spying to see if you can still run things?"" asked Roman.  
  
  ""I'm certain of it. I want you to follow her around and see who she reports back to. I'd do it myself, but it's better if I don't appear suspicious. So I need to stay visible. ""  
  
  ""Lovely,"" said Roman, voice as dry as his father's. ""There's nothing I want to do more than trail a succubus around.

This move supports Nestlé’s global Net Zero 2050 roadmap and targets 100% renewable electricity in Thailand by year-end. The factories—covering sites for ice cream, coffee creamer, water, and pet food across multiple provinces—now use energy from sources such as hydroelectric and solar.

**The idea: A Café Hopping App**  
It’s a monthly membership platform where users get credits to redeem artisanal matcha and coffee drinks at curated local cafés. Kind of like ClassPass, but for coffee. You get to explore cool new cafés, it’s more affordable than paying full price each time, and you collect digital stamps with each visit that unlock rewards (like discounts, freebies, etc).

* You get a set number of monthly credits to use on drinks.
* Drink costs vary (1–3 credits) depending on price.
* Every visit earns you a digital stamp. Perks increase the more you explore.

Would you actually use something like this in your city? Would this concept be worth investing in if it had solid café partners and a user-friendly app? What would make you *not* use it?

A few days ago I happen to see three kittens with it. It gave birth. There is some space. Some room. So I did not particularly know it gave birth. Sweet little kittens. Jumping, playing. I live my life. They are living theirs. All great.

Now I wanted to brush, they four were in the middle. I made a movement. Kittens got inside. Mother made a sound, I think with its legs. Then growled at me.

The same cat which moves around my legs when it sees the plate that I eat, as it knows it is food, knows I will feed it. The same cat that responds to my voice. It growled. The sound of protection. Protection of its kittens, like I will do something to harm them. It was attentive. Alert.

Pet. Mother. Animal.

It did what an animal does. I am doing what modern humans do. Rant online. Officially my first one.

Kitties, I just want to brush. Give me a chance. Give me a chance to brush so that I can have my coffee. Its almost midday.

Here is a good enough photo from yesterday to see the picture. Pardon the untidiness. Empathize with my empty stomach.

Edit. Update.

I think it is feeding. Still now allowing me to do my thing. It was never like this before. I walked by it while it was its kitten yesterday. But not today. Maybe something is going on with it. Have seen kittens born before in our home, not the first time. But today it does not feel like the same cat.

I will not take any chances. As much as I admire and respect our ecosystem, I know that bad things happen too. No more brushing, no more ranting. Full stop.",17,1754457964.0,hyderabad,8,0.81,False

Chapter 7, Day 7

|BEEP…BEEP…BEEP|

Maya groggily woke up to the sound of her alarm, strangely tired from last night. She saw Naiomi still sleeping, a rare occurrence for her to be off her feeding schedule. Mymy wasn’t at the door, having nothing planned. As for Maya, she finally had a peaceful morning on vacation. She walked downstairs for breakfast, to only find her parents relaxing before they had work. It was strange, as Maya wasn’t used to this-ever.

“Good Morning Mom, Morning Dad”

“Morning Maya” her mom says, disgruntled after last night. “Did I wake you?”

“No I.. just had insomnia”

“Summer does that to people” her dad commented,

“I’m glad you didn’t end up like Coco, Maya”

“Y-yeah, but I-” Maya quickly stops herself, as she didn’t want a morning argument.

“I would allow this degenerate behavior if you were a teenager. But that Coco is doing this as an adult. Disgusting. Absolutely disgusting.”

“I helped her yesterday”

Her mom looks back to her, with a cold stare. A cold stare of disbelief that Coco could be helped.

“...I dusted off her room, got her new clothes, she learned how to use the computer, and I reorganized some things.”

“But did she get job?”

“No”

Everybody goes silent, the parents ignore Maya and continue their morning. Without protest, Maya goes back upstairs to freshen up. The awkward aroma was impossible to ignore. Still persistent, Maya planned out her day with Coco. Like many times before, her brain wasn’t being useful to her. She tried her hardest to think of what to do with Coco, but all that her brain could focus on was cat, argument, food. The argument worried her, as she didn’t know if Coco felt fine, or Mymy’s thoughts on the argument. But she couldn’t go home, as she still had three more days before she could get on her train for her departure. 

Then she realized that she could alternate between Mymy and Coco. If she spent time with Mymy in the morning, she could finally get all the missing information through her lies. As for Coco, she could keep improving her in the afternoon. She didn’t know what to exactly do, but all she wanted was to squeeze out as much time as possible. As the memory of her leaving to live with Lina resurfaced, Maya realized that she truly didn’t know how it affected everyone in her family separately. She only knew that her parents were worried sick, especially her mom. As her mom called over 200 times with no way to reach out to her. As for her dad, he blew up her phone full of texts. As she finally got out of the bathroom, she went to wake up her cat. Naiomi, in a lazy mood, had Maya carry her downstairs for her food. But as the clock struck eight, her parents had already left for work. Soon, Mymy also came downstairs as Maya was making her cat’s food. Her hair looked like a rats nest, her pajamas were wrinkled, and she had slight eye bags. She gave a faint smile to Maya and greeted her, and she promptly sat down on the couch.

“So, Mymy. Does that happen every night?”

“I don’t know”

“Is Coco ever open about… that?”

Mymy rubs her eyes, “...nope, we don’t talk often enough for me to know”

“Alright…”

Maya’s concern only grew, as memories of her mom treating her like Coco when she was a teen started to resurface. She tried to hold back the tears, and she was successful, as the result was a sloppily made cat breakfast. Maya grabbed a cup of coffee, and decided to make toast. Overcome by her emotions, she quickly dashed upstairs, as Mymy started to make her own breakfast. She started getting anxious again, but not to the point of an attack. 

She knocked on Coco’s door, no answer.

She did it again. Silence.

She did it one last time, and the door slowly opened.

Coco looked at her through the door, looking as worse as ever. Her eyes were puffy from crying, her hair had lost its color again, and some of it was severely tangled. Usually manageable, her eyebags had dark coloring to them. A type of purplish color someone could only get from skipping too much sleep. Her skin was also slightly dimmed, as her clothes and face picked up the last bits of remaining dust.

“...Morning Coco”

“Morning.”

There was an awkward pause between them, as Coco stared dead into Maya eyes.

“Are you ok?”

Coco’s soul completely left her body, and she tried to hug Maya, but something prevented her from doing so. She let Maya into her room, and they both sat on the bed.

“Was that an argument, or was mom berating you?”

“An argument..”

“Does it happen often?”

“Only in the last 6 months. Mom didn’t intervene as much before…” Coco’s voice starts to break, and Maya hugs her, having empathy for her mothers wrath. But Coco felt no comfort.

“Please just freshen up and come downstairs, alright?”

“Alright.”

Shortly after Maya left, Coco took the new clothes Maya bought and went to the bathroom. Maya headed back downstairs, and Mymy was scrolling on her phone.

“After Coco is done, do you want to go to the park?”

“I’ll see”, as Mymy keeps scrolling on her phone

Antsy, Maya cleans her cat’s bowl and plays with her. As Coco finally got out, Mymy took her time going upstairs. Maya and Coco sat in the living room together, with nothing to say after last night. They each had their days planned out, with the only change in Coco’s day is that she would go get lunch with Maya. Suddenly, Mymy gained a lot of energy from getting ready, and she agreed to hangout with her in the park. They left Coco home alone, and they started walking to the park. The town is eerily quiet, as it’s a time of day where most adults are at work, and the children are in no mood to play. The town for once, felt like it belonged to Maya. She felt as if she fit in, despite her overall disconnect from The Netherlands. They kept walking, as the town felt small without its people in it. They quickly arrived at the park, as there was nothing to look at, or any changes that felt odd. The park was quiet and fresh. The overall nostalgic feel mixed in well with the unique woodland it had, and the pathway was smooth on foot and bike. Despite rarely going to the park when they were children, they felt like they were in the right place. Maya and Mymy did not stop walking, until they found a bench near a well-maintained lake. The ducks quacked loudly, and the water was still. The ripples sang a tune that only the water knew, as the plants gave a sightly look.

“So, Mymy…”

“Yeah?”

“I still have questions about the things you’ve told me.”

“Oh… like what?”

“Everything. After learning about your biological sister and how you’re only famous in Drenthe… what’s true and what’s not?”

“...not a lot.”

“Not a lot of things are true?!”

“No, not a lot are lies. I only lied because I wanted you to think I could do better.”

“Mymy, you’re already doing great. But do better at what?”

“Even though we were fifteen, and well, I was dumb too, you told me that well… I would get…” 

Mymy quickly shuttered, as she couldn't even get out the words that Maya once said to her, but Maya was still clueless as to what was wrong. She tried to get Mymy to say what she said, but the memory of that moment was separated in each of their timelines. 

“I… really don’t think you realize your impact of how you disappeared”

“I think I’m starting to, Mymy. I didn’t know how much you cared about me until that day.”

“Did you? You barely even responded to my texts for a few months.”

“I do. You were crying at Walibi, and I just felt.. awful.”

“I guess you know some of it. It’s just- you left at the worst times for the family. But you were in your room all the time, or out when most of us were asleep- You didn’t know anything!”

“Mymy, that’s why i’m here now. Helping you, Coco, Mom and Dad by just being here”

“Just because you’re here doesn’t cure that wound”

“It’s the start, right?”

“Maybe. I know you’re sorry Maya, and I accept that, but there’s just some things that still hurt years later.”

“I know how that feels Mymy. I still worry that Naiomi might disappear like how Nyoga did even though it’s been sixteen years.”

Mymy gives a chuckle. Genuine, but forced in her mental state “Well, Coco can’t get rid of her this time”

Suddenly, Maya remembers that she left Naiomi at home. She forgot to say goodbye to her, check on how she was doing, or if Coco was fine being alone with her. She immediately pulled out her phone, and forgot if she even had Coco’s contact. Unwilling to borrow Mymy’s phone, she started frantically looking. In her short, rapid search, she opened Whatsapp, that app she rarely used. She didn’t scroll far, and Coco was at the bottom of her contacts. Four years.

It has been four years since Maya last texted Coco.

Although she was familiar with Coco’s presence once again, she was still hesitant to send a text. But not knowing how her cat was doing, she forced herself to send it. Mymy looked over at Maya, curious as to why she shut down suddenly. For Mymy, she thought that she was just anxious again, but Maya deflected. There was an awkward pause, as time kept going. The ducks were swimming in the pond, unbothered by the heat. The cold river and the humidity made a swimming pool for the ducks, although too disgusting for humans. The sisters kept sitting there, relaxing at the sight of the ducks. There was nothing, nothing to be bothered about. Maya’s phone finally buzzes, and it’s Coco. 

\[H0i MaYa, CAt is FiNE. No a11g3iS. WhY d1D u T3Xt?\]

It was at least enough information to calm Maya. She didn’t need to respond to Coco’s question, as it could have already been answered through Maya’s trip. Mymy kept peeking over, curious who Maya was texting. Maya finally answered, and kept talking to Mymy. Although slightly awkward from the long pause, they enjoy a brief conversation, and then finally decide to head back. The park seemed larger, but the environment was definitely more humid and hotter. The sisters started walking on the smooth dirt path, with only some stones this time. Mymy tripped on one, and got her hands slightly dusty. Maya checked her phone, a total of four hours had passed, an almost-perfect overlap for her and Coco to get lunch. Once again, the town was still quiet, but this time, it was Mymy only talking at Maya. With Maya enduring Mymy’s long rants and unnecessary details about her life, they finally make it home. Maya immediately starts looking for the cat in every room possible, she checks under her bed, all open cabinets, and even small places the cat couldn’t fit into. She was nowhere, and she started to panic. 

\[What if Coco gave her away… like Nyoga…\]

Then a loud meow was heard from upstairs. Maya slowly crept up there, to only find the cat hanging out on the opposite side of Coco’s room. Her door was halfway open, with her staring directly at the cat. She was hanging out near the door to prevent allergies, only wishing that she could pet Maya’s cat. Relieved, Maya enters Coco’s room and picks up her cat, wich shed all over her floor. 

“So, Coco?”

Coco looks at her, trying to prevent an allergy attack “ja?”

“Want to clean up first and then get lunch”

“I need claritin first… but sure”

Maya takes her cat down to Mymy, who is laying on the couch texting her boyfriend. She holds Naiomi, and kisses her on the nose, as Maya goes to grab a broom and duster. 

“Did your allergies just start to happen?”

“No, I didn’t have allergies before when Naiomi was near me. So I thought I didn’t have a cat allergy anymore, I let her in shortly before you came home, and I sneezed.”

“But don’t lock her in your room Coco. I thought she was going to disappear like how Nyoga did…”

“Maya, i’m sorry for ruining your life”

Maya looks at Coco, getting a good look at her again.

“I’m fine now Coco. Everything is ok with me now, with you… i’m sorry that I was an asshole to you when we were teenagers”

Coco looks back at Maya, unsure if she can accept her apology. She knew she meant well, but although it was healing, the scar of abandonment was still bleeding out. They went back to cleaning in silence, with Maya having to occasionally kick the cat out of the room. After Maya made Coco’s bed, Coco finally freshened up to go outside. Then Maya went back downstairs to find Mymy back to scrolling, completely unaware of her surroundings. As in her surroundings, Naiomi broke several pieces of glass while Mymy was distracted. The cat was sitting on a ledge, giving Maya a stare for her to challenge her. She did, but after she angrily ripped Mymy away from the phone, they both entered a race to clean against the cat’s nonstop destruction. Maya won the battle, and she locked Naiomi in the study just in time for Coco to get back downstairs. Mymy sat on their dad’s chair dazed, and waved goodbye to Coco and Maya.

With the roaring lunch hour of a Thursday, finding a place would be harder than usual. As some people didn’t work to Friday, and others didn’t work at all. The children were flooding the food stands and restaurants with their families. Somehow, despite it being a Thursday, the amount of people made it feel like a Friday evening. Maya knew the mission, and Coco already wanted to give up. They started walking, and pushed through the crowds like pushing down a wall. Coco got stuck in a few crowds, not without Maya’s fair share of getting stuck in lines. The environment was humid, and felt hot like a watery hell. The air no longer felt breathable, and every step was like swimming on land. Sweat was like bubbles, and nobody’s hair stayed intact. Coco’s already unwashed clothes became even more sweaty and droopy, the sweat couldn’t even be hidden anymore, as the stains wouldn’t stop growing. Maya’s makeup started to streak down her face, with her hair gradually becoming a rat’s nest from every step she took. The ground was uneven, and the world felt slightly dizzy from the heat combined with the humidity. The fans did not help, and after a grueling quarter walk, they slipped into a new restaurant. Still relatively unknown to everybody in town, but it has Air Conditioning. The breeze was like ice cubes across their neck, and helped them keep their heads straight. The sisters stood in the entrance underneath the AC, and they both stank. Luckily, there were relatively few people to see how deranged they looked from the heat, and the host quickly sat them down. The chairs were unusually comfortable, and the building was relatively clean and maintained. It had an expensive feel to it, compared to the two dishes that were served. Maya quickly realized that she didn’t know what restaurant this was- or how expensive the dishes were. But with the two of them too tired from the heat, they decided to eat there anyway.

“Well, Coco, we found a place”

“Yep”

“Do you think it’s nice”

“I guess”

“Coco, are you still thinking about last night?”

“Y-yep. I can’t get it out of my head” Coco whispered.

“You said this has been happening for the past 6 months though?”

“I know. I should be expecting it by now with how old we are… but last night… that was the worst one yet…”

“I heard”

“Yeah…”

Coco looked away from Maya, with her mental state deteriorating right in front of Maya. However, she forces it back down, as the belief of her never caring for Coco starts to win. The waiter brings the menu, and Coco stares at the menu for a few seconds, and picks it up. Maya looks over, getting that sickening feeling again, but Coco’s wall effectively makes Maya not know what’s wrong. They order off the menu, with Maya convincing Coco to eat some more.

“Well, this restaurant is really cheap”

“Yep, I still think i’ll be overstuffed”

“No you won’t Coco, I can afford all of this.”

“I think I could pay for a meal here”

“Most likely. This restaurant is just… cheap.”

Another silence ensues, and Maya keeps trying to get Coco to open up, desperately hoping that her progress isn’t destroyed.

“...w-well, we can do something like twenty questions with all of us tonight Coco!?”

“That sounds good.”

“I-it is?”

“Yep”

“Thank god, we can finally have an activity all three of us can be happy in”“...and I guess I can get filled in on your lives”

“Maybe Mymy will show us a photo of her boyfriend”

“You know Maya, I think Mymy has been lying about him”

“Why would you say that?”

“She lied about everything, I can just tell. That melancholic bitch has been so bad at it- and it’s just- infuriating! And I don’t even know what to say at this point!”

“She did the same thing to me too Coco”

Coco takes a short breath, and comments “I guess this game will help me know the truth”

“I already forced her to debunk her lies. She’s telling the truth… for the most part”

Coco glared at Maya, now wondering if she was telling the truth with her and Mymy’s bond. They kept sitting in silence, and started eating as soon as the waiter brought their food. Even while food was out, they slowly ate in silence. Coco felt her rage pile up inside of her, but this time it was an unexplainable one. One that couldn’t be blamed on Mymy. At the same time, a guilt laid on Maya, feeling horrible for being unable to prevent the argument. She kept eating her meal with Coco in silence. They slowly finish, and pay for their food right at the table, with the bill only totaling up to 21.34 Euros for two people. With Coco still in her head, Maya kept trying to bring her out of it. The direction became increasingly clear to Coco, in which she wanted to stay on. Yet, she knew how her night should go. They left the restaurant again, with it only being slightly filled up. Eventually, Maya gave up, and the silence became the only thing that stood there. Even in the busy crowds, the only thing that could be heard was silence. The silence was felt, seen, and heard. Nothing was there, everything was a blur for each step. Every animal was just another speck of dust, and the family home looked like a shoebox. For a moment, their minds went blank. It went blank right at the front door, and only filled up once again when they opened the doors. 

It was unexpectedly clean. With Mymy dressed in cleaning wear and sweaty, the entire house has no more traces of dust. Except the sister’s rooms, as Mymy didn’t want any of their belongings to get displaced. Especially with Maya’s cat. Meanwhile, Naiomi was laying inside a kitty burrito on the couch, nicely wrapped and tucked in by Mymy. The girls greeted each other, and Coco immediately darted straight to her room. It was only fifteen PM exactly, and there was too much time to kill. 

“So Maya, do you know where we can play your game”

“Do you want to play it?”

“Yep! But do I have to buy it?”

“Nope, just download it on your phone.”

“I thought it cost something?”

“It’s free on the phone, but you only need to buy it on itch io Mymy”

“Well, wanna play it together?”

“...only with two devices”

As soon as Mymy downloaded the app, she immediately spent .50 Euros on currency. To prevent Mymy from spending more, Mymy gave her many gifts to give her a boost in game. For Maya’s surprise, Mymy was completely immersed in her game. Although it looked like a general MMO, the unique European influence of Germany, Belgium, France, and Ireland is what attracted most players. Along with the freeing aspect of not being reliant on pay to play, or pay to win. The only thing that cost money was the currency to buy exclusive armor and accessories, wich people were willing to pay almost anything for. With only Coco missing, time flew by, with them only looking at the clock when their parents got home. It was 17PM, which was unusually late for both their parents. With Maya slightly delirious from the heavy gaming, she asked why her parents were home late in a somewhat younger manner. For her mom, she had to work overtime as her dad got out early. However, due to the car having some difficulty in starting, having her dad pick her mom up after her minimal overtime. With dinner not made for anybody, Coco in her room, and the girls playing video games, their mom started screaming at them. But it didn't last long, as unlike Coco, this was a slight mistake.

As everyone was tired, the family decided to fend for themselves, and their parents went to bed early after the overtime and car problems. Coco finally emerged from her room without any reason, and went downstairs. She stared at a wall for a minute, until Maya invited both of them to hangout in the living room. Surprisingly, Coco accepted, and they started chatting. Overall, it was light.

“...Well, my boyfriend and I have been dating for a while. I don’t think I'm exactly in the honeymoon phase.”

“Mymy, you’ve only known him for a few months. I don’t think you can trust him”

“He’s better than the others though”

“Give it time, he’s a good man but you need to rethink about moving again”

“I guess… we haven’t moved into each other's home yet”

However, things quickly got dark when Coco accidentally mentioned Maya moving to Belgium, and Mymy felt herself about to tear up. She held back the guilt, rage, and regret she felt on that day. But Maya finally started to learn how bad things became, she was truly understanding how her disappearance impacted the family. Coco was giving up on life, as the pandemic was taking everything away from Coco. Her friends were drifting apart, and enjoying their lives at home. Coco couldn’t understand technology, but still had to persist to get her diploma. She learnt nothing. She learnt nothing as everything she was good at was physical. She couldn;t practice for rugby, her parents started putting too much pressure on her, and eventually, she retreated to her room, for a long time.

As for Maya, almost nothing changed. As a matter of fact, things got better for her. Her anxiety wasn't as crazy as it was when she was in school, so she could do her schoolwork without interruptions. With everybody in their rooms most of the time, for the first time in her life, she felt like she could freely roam the house without anybody interrupting. Sometimes, she would pass Mymy, who frequently looked distressed, but that didn't matter to teenage Maya. She also met her best friend, Lina, one month exactly after the pandemic started. It first started as a troll, of both of them trying to catfish each other. When they revealed who they were, it was strange. However, they kept talking, and Lina was the friend Maya never had: A patient person who respected her boundaries, and shared a lot in common with her. Maya understood Lina’s struggles, as she, too, was mixed race, as she was half Congoise, half Belgian. However, she came from a much larger family where she had seven siblings in total, and she was the middle child. She was introverted without anxiety, and was living on her own due to her bad past in her hometown. Their relationship deepened quickly, as it felt like they were waiting for each other for a long, long time. Lina helped Maya realize what she wants to do, helped her learn to code, and encouraged her to make many games for money. Maya was getting better with her, and eventually revealed how her family life was like. She invited her to live with her, but Maya was unsure and anxious. Although her anxiety improved slightly, it was nowhere near great enough to go back outside.

But she knew she always wanted to leave.

Soon enough, she accepted. Lina, once again, provided Maya help with her escape plan. At this point in their friendship, she knew Lina was not trying to harm her whatsoever, as they even saw each other's faces during a skype call. She helped Maya pick out a college for her lacking academic credentials, and it was perfect just for her. It was so desperate for students, as its acceptance rate was one-hundred percent. Maya applied, and got in.

Then the night came. Everything was paid for by Lina, and everything Maya needed was packed up. To leave no trace, she even took her blobfish and would carry it the entire journey. Maya remembered the rage, the anger, the fury, and the impulsive decision to leave in the middle of the night, with no goodbyes whatsoever. Nobody knew of her plan. But back then, she thought nobody would care about her, even though Lina was her new best friend. She remembered the journey, the nerve-racking anxiety she felt being outside, and the beauty of the night. She also remembered the long nighttime bike ride to the station, where she flipped off her hometown, and for the first time in her life, felt at peace.

Mymy and Coco listened attentively, with Mymy finally breaking. 

“I’M SORRY THAT I ALWAYS TEASED YOU FOR BEING ALONE!” and Mymy burst out into uncontrollable tears at that moment. 

“M-Maya… i’m sorry… it was only on that day I knew I-I knew how you felt” Mymy was trying to use her last bits of strength to reveal something that nobody knew, a part of the story that would make Maya truly understand.

“...I met this guy online, his username was KingDutch… with two exe’s and underscores. He made that account when he was 12, and I thought he was nice. Well, I really did. Nothing about him alarmed me, and we… had the same political ideas… heh” Mymy slowly started to regain her composure, with Coco trying to help stabilize her.

“I remember, we used to chat often, flirt, send cute selfies… it was wonderful. Eventually, we started dating despite the ten year age gap, I really should have known not to do that. The texting became more often, and eventually he would start harassing me.” Mymy started to cry again, but she kept going.

“I thought it was normal, I thought him texting like that was normal. It only became worse when we started to call each other over discord, he would demand we’d call every hour to make sure I wasn't cheating. I did. We became closer, and it kept hurting me, as I just stopped taking care of my hair and letting it grow…” Mymy took some deep breaths.

“We decided to meet in real life, at his place. Obviously our parents didn’t care. I went in, I took off my jacket ....” Mymy started to cry again, “...and I got molested…badly. He kept stripping me and doing these vile things to me, but I got out.”

Mymy looked at the ground, appalled at what happened once again. But she was determined to finish her story to help Maya understand.

“...and it just kept happening. I got assaulted daily, touched, and abused. The night before you left I was distressed, I passed by you, and you didn’t look at me. I felt disgusting… and when you left that day, I never felt… so… alone before. I finally understood how you felt all those years, as nobody cared. I couldn’t tell anybody. I laid down on the floor, and everything just seemed dark. The walls closed into me, and I was empty. And I was there, and nothing else…”

Mymy’s eyes were completely red and tearful, “I just wanted someone there for me.”

Maya sat there, and the words she said when she was fifteen finally came back.

\[I hope you get raped by a conservative\]

 She said that out of pure fury during a screaming match with Mymy. After she remembered them, they echoed throughout her head. Her wish came true, and Maya finally realized what she had done abandoning her family like that. Her mom was irritated and had gone insane, Coco gave up on life, and Mymy was alone. She finally realized that although the wounds were finally starting to heal, there would need to be a lot more work done. More work than she could currently put in. She came over, and hugged Mymy. For once, Mymy genuinely felt an apology from Maya, and Maya looked back at Coco, then Mymy. Each one of them would need a genuine, different apology.

  Maya held Mymy while she calmed down, and they tried to finish their game that they were playing. Unsurprisingly, Mymy won despite her unregulated emotional state. Her and Maya hugged one last time before bed. Deep down, Mymy knew that Maya understood what she did, and that this was the first stage of healing for her.

  The women washed up for bed, and Maya fell asleep with her cat, and Mymy dozed off in her partially-converted room. As for Coco, she couldn’t deal with anything anymore. Even after the game, where Mymy forgave Maya, she couldn’t think that there was anything redeemable. Parents just want her gone. They only yell at her now. Maya left, and her coming back isn;t fixing anything. Mymy is busy with her new life and career…

And Coco? To her, why would she be anything? She couldn’t even learn anything from covid, or even have something good happen to her.

Coco started searching her room, nothing. Then she went to the garage, still nothing. There were no pills or anything of harm in the bathroom either, and the ones that her parents needed? The pills could only get you high. Coco sighed,

\[I guess it has to be painful\]

She took the sharpest knife from the kitchen, went back up to her room, and started organizing everything.",3,1754457455.0,ongezellig,0,1.0,False

1miw28f,https://www.reddit.com/r/BCPublicServants/comments/1miw28f/struggles_at_bcps/,Struggles at BCPS,"TLDR: Late night ramblings 

With a strike looming I got to thinking what causes the inefficiencies at BCPS. This is meant somewhat lightheartedly but it’s honest feedback. I’m sure some people will be upset but that’s not my intention.

As someone who has been in the BCPS for many years in excluded roles at MCFD and recently accepted a role outside government, here’s what I saw. My views are primarily based on my experience at MCFD but I have been in touch with colleagues who have taken TAs or permanent transfers to other ministries.

1) The executives are primarily social workers and don’t like outsiders.

Most of them were great, well known social workers who excelled at their jobs but then were then progressively promoted up the excluded ladder, which requires a considerably different skill-set. MCFD works primarily based on who you know above a certain level, despite what they’ll say about fair processes. 

The are some issues with this. Social workers are known for skills like empathy, not fiscal responsibility, ability to decipher and negotiate contracts, create effective organizational structures, and so on. They approach almost entirely from the empathy lens, have things collapse fiscally and operationally, then pump more money into it or cancel it altogether. This is one of the reasons MCFD seems to be always restructuring of late.

The other issue is that when someone external slips through the cracks with good business sense, but are not former social workers, they are effectively ostracized by the existing EDS group, and often take a TA or permanent move elsewhere.

It’s very inefficient and many resources are wasted. I’ve had colleagues at other ministries say how much more organized and orderly some of them are - particularly CITZ. I’ve never heard a single person say anything bad about that ministry after moving from MCFD.

2) The union makes it next to impossible to get rid of underperforming or challenging staff. This creates so much unnecessary overhead and brings down the morale of the productive and happy staff.

I would say at least 90% of my staff ranged between good and excellent. 5% are ok, 5% are terrible. Every single person our team hired was good or better. However we inherited some staff through placement and reorgs and words cannot describe how bad some of them were. I’ve separated them into the following categories: 

Countdown Karen

Literally doesn’t care about anything except for retiring. Shows up to work ready to go home. They have been there long enough and have gone through so many employee disputes that they have the stewards on speed dial and know the absolute bare minimum to skate by through prior precedents. It’s such a bad example for everyone on the team. 

They tend to pushback on anything they deem is not their job even when it’s clearly in their job description. Will try to push boundaries on how little work they can get away with doing - in one case they literally delegated every single one of their duties to their staff. 

Time Capsule Tim

They are close to or past retirement but refuse to retire. They may have a good attitude and want to contribute but does everything in the least efficient way possible. I’m sure these people try to fax Teams messages to each other. To be fair, I think there may have been a time when they were good at their jobs but times changed and they didn’t.

They measure their productivity by how much time they physically spend at the office and not how much work they actually do. They tend to have an 12-18 classifications but are constantly outperformed by the young clerk 9s and 12s who are more efficient and capable.

Many of them are blissfully unaware or unaccepting of how inefficient they are despite multiple discussions and performance plans. They have an unusually high opinion of their abilities. To be clear this is not all older staff, just a small subset of older staff who haven’t changed with the times.

Accommodation Annie

They need to be accommodated for everything, often multiple accommodations at once. I’ve had people wanting to be accommodated for not wanting to work with others (what?), to bring their pets every day to the office (not guide dogs), needing to take multiple breaks per hour for undisclosed trauma, the list goes on. 

The Union’s Role. 

It is soul-sucking and time consuming to performance manage people in the BCPS if they choose to grieve. The endless calls with the person and union stewards, calls with PSA because you cannot say a single wrong word otherwise it’ll be used against you during the grievance, accommodation plans, people randomly going on STIIP after being fed up, it takes your whole day, week, month - depending on the situation.

I understand the union is there to protect workers. I have seen the union protect great workers from terrible directors. But in my (biased) opinion it primarily protects the people who contribute little but cling on to their jobs, knowing full well they would not survive in a different setting. Most excluded staff I’ve encountered do everything in our power to retain and promote the positive and productive staff. 

3) The performative stuff

I’m convinced it’s like 1-2% of the staff that make us go through these endless wrongspeak trainings, discrimination trainings, and those calls where 2 people talk about how victimized they are because the barista misspelled their name on their coffee order.

99.99% of the interactions I’ve had in a day to day setting that didn’t involve having to performance manage people have been wonderful and totally respectful.

When people join a call with people they know or are close with, they start by getting straight to the point or joke about their weekends. When you’re in a call with strangers, or someone you’re trying to impress you must do the land acknowledgement with the 30 people on the call, taking up the next 30 minutes of your scheduled hour. If you must do it with people you’ve spoken to 500 times already, wouldn’t an “I’m calling in from X, I’d also like to acknowledge your lands” suffice?  

Anyway, these are just the late night ramblings of a former colleague. Overall I loved working with many of the people I met at BCPS, and will have many positive memories of my experience. Best of luck with the bargaining - you deserve better pay for what you do.",0,1754457450.0,BCPublicServants,4,0.5,False
1miw1oo,https://www.reddit.com/r/TechJobsNZ/comments/1miw1oo/top_tips_from_a_tech_recruiter_10_years_in_the/,Top Tips From a Tech Recruiter (10 Years in the Game),"Having spent almost a decade working as a tech recruiter, I thought I’d share a few observations and practical tips — in the hope they might help some of you land your next opportunity.

As we all know, the tech market has become incredibly competitive. Even highly experienced professionals are struggling to secure roles, and for recent grads, it’s even harder to get that crucial foot in the door.

AI is opening up new opportunities, but it’s also disrupting the job market in a big way. A lot of roles will be displaced as companies try to do more with less. It can be really discouraging to apply for jobs where you’re one of hundreds (or thousands) of applicants and never hear back.

With that in mind, here are a few key strategies that can give you a competitive edge:

# 1.  Network, network, network

Yes, it’s obvious — but it’s crucial. Especially if you’re early in your career.

I know it can feel draining, but if you attend events that genuinely interest you, you’ll learn a lot and the networking will feel more natural. Conversations flow easier when you're passionate about the topic.

* Try sites like [Meetup](https://meetup.com) or [Eventbrite NZ](https://eventbrite.co.nz) to find interesting tech meetups, talks, or hackathons.
* If you can, go solo — that’ll nudge you to talk to new people. But if that feels like too much, bring a mate *and* make it a goal to meet at least one or two new people.

# 2.  LinkedIn is your friend

You’d be surprised how many people don’t have a LinkedIn profile, or have one with no photo or outdated info.

* Keep it up to date with a professional photo
* Add a short summary that reflects your skills, values, and goals
* Don’t be afraid to connect with strangers and send a brief intro message

Here’s an example:

""Hey, I'm a recent XYZ graduate interested in ABC. I came across your profile and found your career path inspiring. Any chance I could shout you a coffee and pick your brain on how to break into the industry?""

This taps into the *Benjamin Franklin effect* — people are more likely to help if they’ve already helped you in a small way. If 3 out of 10 people say yes, you’re winning.

# 3. Make yourself known before you apply

Whenever possible, try to connect with the hiring manager *before* you apply.

It’s a great way to:

* Build rapport
* Get a sense of whether the role is actually a good fit
* Show you’re proactive

Even something simple like this can go a long way:

""Hi, I saw the XYZ role advertised — it looks super interesting. Are you free for a quick 2-minute call or email chat? I’ve just got a couple of questions before I apply to make sure it’s the right fit.""

This gives you insight into the role and team, and allows you to tailor your application more effectively. You’ve now built a light-touch connection, and your name is familiar when your CV lands in their inbox.

# 4. Less is best – tailor every application

Focus on quality over quantity. It’s better to send five well-targeted applications than fifty generic ones.

* Tailor your CV and cover letter to match the key skills listed in the job ad
* Keep formatting simple and easy to scan
* Always save as a PDF (with your name and the company in the filename)

Also:

* Track your applications in a spreadsheet
* Add a few bullet points on why each role appealed to you
* That way, when you get a call, you’re on the front foot and sound confident and prepared

(Yes, I once received a `.txt` CV and nearly had a migraine reading it.)

These are a few tips to help navigate the early stages of the hiring process. If people are interested, I can do a follow-up on interview strategies and how to influence the process in your favour.

The vibes were low, the coffee was burnt, and the office was eerily quiet except for keyboards clacking and someone softly crying into their spreadsheets (might’ve been me).

Then Steve did it. Again.
He brought out his leftover fish and microwaved it. Again.

The smell was immediate. It hit the break room first, then spread like an airborne disease. It smelled like a wet seal that lost a fight with a garbage truck. People started coughing. The intern looked like he was about to cry. Someone opened a window even though we’re on the 23rd floor and they don’t open. It was bad.

So I decided to take a stand.
While Steve was on one of his famously long bathroom breaks (seriously man, hydrate less), I printed out a few signs that said:
“Microwaving fish in a shared workspace is a crime against humanity. Stop the madness.”
I taped them to the microwave, the fridge, the break room door, and his chair.

Then, I renamed the office WiFi to “NoFishMicrowavesPls”.
Left a can of Febreze on his desk with a frozen burrito and a sticky note that just said “alternatives :)”

I’ll admit, it was petty. But it’s been two weeks and no fish has been nuked. The office smells like nothing again, and honestly, I’ve never been happier to breathe boring air.

I am a teenager in Norwalk and I am starting to fear that I will never be able to live here as an adult due to gentrification and rising prices. Each new store that opens in Norwalk (which tends to by ran by ex New Yorkers) is affordable for those living on a NYC salary but feels very out of reach for those who are not. It’s so difficult to find somewhere to rent that won’t cost an arm and a leg even in the neighborhoods that used to be extremely affordable. Every new condo or apartment that pops up is copy and paste, lacks character, and is unaffordable for those already living in the area.
 At times it feels like former New Yorkers who live in the luxurious parts of SONO look down on their neighbors whose family has lived there for decades. sometimes I attend community events and most, if not all, of the adults are from NYC and live in SONO or East Norwalk. Too many times it feels like these people look down or take pitty on me because I don’t live in a trendy area of the city. The look on their faces when I tell them I dont go to a private school and I didn’t go to a “good” middle school is sympathetic but also patronizing. 
It’s starting to feel like Norwalk is a place where young professionals go when they get sick of New York City and they try to turn Norwalk into something it’s not. Norwalk isn’t a more suburban , quite New York. Norwalk is Norwalk and that’s ok!!! Please don’t take it as I don’t want New Yorkers or other people moving here. That would be hypocritical because I wasn’t even born in Norwalk. It just seems like whenever another young professional moves in, a new expensive coffee shop opens or the rent goes up. It’s just very disheartening. Btw this post isn’t backed by any data or anything like that it’s just based on what I’ve seen and how I feel. ",1,1754456969.0,norwalk,2,0.66,False

## PETRICHOR X
### Scent list

There are no new additions to PETRICHOR X except for a variant of Night Work (located on the main Night Work page) that features a stronger smoke accord. 

When the collection returns in 2026, we're splitting it up into an early spring release and a late summer release, and we'll add new fragrances to the line-up at that time. PETRICHOR X scents are available as trinkets or baubles and will be available until November 2025. 

* **Dude Ranch** - the rain on the plains - wet green grass, ozone, dust, dried hay, mud, green leather, warm animal musk, blonde tobacco, Virginian cedarwood
* **Glass Jungle** - sulfurous tropical fruit, crushed ferns, fogged glass walls, heady hothouse flowers, unearthly orchids, looming mushrooms, buzzing grow lights, irrigation tubes, sprinkler water
* **Lost Epitaph** - briar rose, narcissus, creeping ivy, crumbling headstones, cemetery rain
* **Night Work** - a steady downpour on an unapologetically indolic garden of orange blossoms, narcissus, jasmine grandiflorum, rose, and tuberose with wisps of cigarette smoke and black coffee
* **Perilla Garden** - sparkling maesil tea, potting soil, perilla leaf, rhubarb, bean sprouts, rain-soaked hinoki trees, hiba cedar mulch, lapsang souchong, garden rain (proceeds benefit Stop AAPI Hate)
* **Sunshower Valley** - creosotebush, sweet orange, mountain laurel, cold rain warming on damp skin, sagebrush, pinon, wet sand, desert rain, scattered orange blossom petals
* **Sylph Hollow** - sparkling rain on the orchards & gardens in the sylphaene woodlands - peach blossoms, pixie plum nectar, lilac, wisteria, dewy woodland mosses, woodland rain
* **The Seahorse** - cherry lipgloss, gardenia tanning oil, rain falling on chlorinated pool water, wet swimsuits, blue coconut slushies, vinyl pool chair slats, and the ambient smell of popcorn and cotton candy from Tom’s Snack Shack


We've made a couple of minor changes to the notes list for clarity - Sunshower Valley now lists ""creosotebush"" instead of ""chaparral resin exudate,"" and The Seahorse now lists ""blue coconut slushies"" instead of ""ocean water slushies,"" since the latter is a colloquial (and likely trademarked) name that also caused some confusion with the scent profile.

## key Features Analysis

The Reclaimed Wood Furniture Coffee Table offers a distinct blend of durability, aesthetic appeal, and functional design.

**Material Composition:** The coffee table is primarily constructed from reclaimed wood, typically sourced from old barns, factories, and homes. Each piece retains unique characteristics like nail holes, knots, and weathering patterns, contributing to the table's individual charm and story. The wood is carefully selected and treated to ensure structural integrity and longevity, making it suitable for daily use. This ensures that each table is not only gorgeous but also durable and environmentally responsible.

**Dimensions and Weight Capacity:** Most reclaimed wood coffee tables come in varying sizes to accommodate different room dimensions. A typical table might measure around 48 inches in length, 24 inches in width, and 18 inches in height. The weight capacity can range from 100 to 200 pounds, making it sturdy enough to hold books, decorative items, and even occasional meals. The solid wood construction contributes to its stability and ability to withstand daily wear and tear.

**Finish and Treatment:** The reclaimed wood undergoes a finishing process to enhance its natural beauty and protect against moisture and damage.Options include clear coats, stains, and sealants that preserve the wood's texture and color while preventing warping, cracking, and fading. Some manufacturers use low-VOC (volatile organic compounds) finishes to ensure indoor air quality and minimize environmental impact. This adds to the table’s longevity and ease of maintenance.

**Leg design and Support:** The table legs play a crucial role in both the aesthetic and structural support of the piece. Common leg designs include metal hairpin legs, wooden trestle legs, and industrial-style steel legs. These legs are often reinforced to ensure stability and prevent wobbling, even on uneven floors. The choice of leg design can significantly impact the table's overall style, with metal legs lending a modern, industrial vibe and wooden legs complementing a more traditional, rustic look.

Key features of the Reclaimed Wood Furniture Coffee Table include:

* Unique reclaimed wood construction
* Durable and sturdy build
* Eco-friendly materials
* Customizable finishes and leg styles

## Core Benefits

The Reclaimed Wood Furniture Coffee table offers a range of compelling benefits for homeowners and interior design enthusiasts.

**Sustainability:** By utilizing reclaimed wood, these coffee tables contribute to environmental conservation. Reusing wood reduces the demand for newly harvested timber, which helps preserve forests and reduce carbon emissions associated with logging and transportation. Opting for a reclaimed wood table is a tangible step towards promoting sustainable practices and reducing your environmental footprint.

**Unique Aesthetic Appeal:** Each reclaimed Wood Furniture Coffee Table is one-of-a-kind, showcasing the natural imperfections and character of the reclaimed wood. No two tables are exactly alike, making each piece a unique statement in your living room. The weathered texture, nail holes, and natural variations in color and grain pattern add depth and visual interest that cannot be replicated with new materials.

**Durability and longevity:** Reclaimed wood is often denser and more durable than newly harvested wood, having aged and weathered over time. This inherent strength makes reclaimed wood furniture exceptionally resistant to wear and tear, ensuring that your coffee table will stand the test of time. The robust construction and careful finishing further enhance its longevity, making it a worthwhile investment for years to come.**Conversation Starter:** A Reclaimed Wood Furniture Coffee Table is more than just a functional piece of furniture; it's a conversation starter. Each table tells a story, reflecting the history of the wood from which it was made. Guests will be intrigued by its unique character and the sustainable practices behind its creation. This makes it a focal point in your living room, adding character and warmth to the space.

1mivt4p,https://www.reddit.com/r/WordpressPlugins/comments/1mivt4p/discussion_still_using_manual_methods_for/,[DISCUSSION] Still using manual methods for managing subscriptions? Why?,"Genuine question here. I see a lot of WooCommerce store owners still handling subscriptions with either basic Woo tools or manually – and it blows my mind a bit.

Not throwing shade, but there are much smoother ways to handle this now.  
I recently migrated a client over to **Subscription for WooCommerce by WPSwings**, and the difference was night and day.

What they were doing before:  
They had a basic product that people could ""subscribe"" to by reordering every month. The store owner would email them reminders, use spreadsheets to track dates, and offer discounts manually.

It was messy, time-consuming, and didn’t feel professional at all to the customer.

What changed:  
**Automatic recurring payments**  
**Subscription pause/resume/cancel features**  
**Subscription box option for curated monthly product delivery**  
**Email notifications for billing/renewals**  
**Supports Stripe, PayPal, and even works with WooCommerce Subscriptions**

We even added **free trials, sign-up fees, and per-product subscription plans** without breaking anything. The plugin just handled it.

Since switching, churn has gone down and customer retention is way up.

Here’s what I don’t get:  
Why are so many WooCommerce users still hesitant to use a dedicated plugin for this?  
Is it just fear of setup complexity? Price? Or is it that they don’t know these plugins exist?

  
If you're trying to sell anything on a recurring basis – coffee, gym memberships, SaaS tools, digital downloads, you name it – having a **dedicated subscription system** is a game-changer.

🔧 What I recommend:

* [**Subscription for WooCommerce by WPSwings**](https://wordpress.org/plugins/subscriptions-for-woocommerce/) – Solid free plugin with all the essentials, and the pro version adds a ton of flexibility.
* You don’t need WooCommerce Subscriptions + a bunch of expensive add-ons anymore.
* Support team was super responsive during setup.

Not trying to sell anything here – just wondering if others feel the same.

Ever feel like you’re throwing money away while trying to create amazing content? Like, you have this million-dollar idea, but you're just pouring cash into tools that don’t help you reach your goldmine? Trust me, I've been there too! It’s like trying to water a plant without realizing it’s a cactus. 🤦‍♂️

**But here’s the thing:** AI tools can actually save you time and money if you know which ones to use. 🤑 So, let’s chat about getting smart with your budget as a beginner creator. Grab your coffee, and let’s dive in!

### Here’s the scoop:

1. **The free tools are your FRIENDS!**  
   - Check out platforms like **Canva** for design and **Google Docs** for writing. They’re loaded with features and – guess what? – free! 🙌 
   - Ever heard of **ChatGPT**? Perfect for brainstorming ideas without spending a dime. 

2. **Invest in the RIGHT tools.**  
   - Sure, there are some paid tools that can make life easier, but only if they really fit your needs. Ask yourself:
     - **Is this going to save me hours?**
     - **Will it help me grow my audience or revenue?**
   - If the answer is a resounding “yes,” then it might be worth the splurge. If not, keep that cash in your wallet!

3. **Don’t fall for shiny object syndrome!**  
   - Everybody’s raving about the latest tool, but remember: **glitzy doesn’t always mean efficient.** You don’t need ALL the things. Focus on what actually works for YOU. 
   - Have you ever bought something that everyone else swore by, only to find it didn’t match your style? Yikes, right? 

4. **Learn to automate.**  
   - Seriously, automating tedious tasks can be a game-changer! Tools like **Zapier** can connect your favorite apps and automate workflows. It’s like setting up a little robot to do the boring stuff for you! 🤖✨
   - How freeing would it be not to manually send emails or post on social media? Talk about a weight off your shoulders!

5. **Community support is GOLD.**  
   - Join groups (like ours 😉) where you can share experiences, tips, and even get recommendations! Getting advice from others who’ve been in your shoes can save you loads of headaches and dollars. 

And here’s a little personal tidbit: I once spent $300 on a fancy software that promised to skyrocket my engagement. Spoiler alert: It didn’t. Instead, I turned to a good ol’ fashioned pen and paper idea session, and that ended up being way more effective. 😂 

**Now, as you embark on your creator journey, think about these questions:**

- What’s one fancy tool you invested in but didn’t pan out? 
- Any hidden gems you’ve discovered that REALLY helped boost your creativity without breaking the bank? 

Remember, smart creators work *smarter*, not *harder*! 💪 So stop throwing your money away and start being intentional with your resources. You've got this!",1,1754456457.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False
1mivpyp,https://i.redd.it/bbhabgobzbhf1.png,Built a micro-journaling app because I was tired of bloated alternatives,"Hi all!

I've been trying to get into journaling for years but every app I downloaded felt... wrong.

**My specific frustrations:**

* Apps like Day One wanted me to write these long, reflective entries every single day. Sometimes I just want to jot down a quick thought during lunch, you know?
* Most store your private thoughts on their servers. Why would I want some company reading my journal entries for ""AI insights""?
* The streak pressure was killing me. Miss one day and you're back to zero. Made journaling feel like a chore instead of something helpful.
* So many unnecessary features - mood tracking, photo collages, sharing options. I just wanted to write stuff down.

**What I actually wanted:**

* Multiple short entries throughout the day when inspiration hits
* My data staying on MY devices (iCloud sync, but it's still mine)
* No guilt if I skip days or want to add something I thought of yesterday
* Just... simple text entry. That's it.

Couldn't find anything that matched this, so I spent a few months building Inkwell in SwiftUI.

Now I actually journal regularly because it doesn't fight me. Sometimes it's just ""good coffee this morning,"" other times it's deeper stuff. No pressure either way.

If anyone wants to try it out, I'd genuinely appreciate the feedback—especially if you've had similar frustrations with other journaling apps. Still learning what works for different people.

Okay, I have a wild idea that’s been *swirling in my brain* all week and I desperately need to know if anyone else is obsessed: AI GIFT CARDS. Wait, hear me out. We all know regular gift cards are a thing—Amazon, Starbucks, the works—but what if gift cards actually…*learned about you*?

Imagine getting a gift card from a friend—it’s not for a specific store, but for an **AI assistant** that immediately begins asking fun, hyper-personalized questions. Like:

- “Hey, what genre of books do you devour at midnight?”
- “Do you prefer classic cashmere or avant-garde street fashion?”
- “Need a fresh playlist or a custom scent for your next house party?”

THEN…*boom!* The AI recommends gifts from select luxury sites or even curates a shopping experience tailored to your answers. Not the bland, generic suggestions like “Buy a watch,” but, “Here’s a one-of-a-kind, limited-edition piece that matches your aesthetic AND that secret hobby you told no one about.”

https://goodnovel.org/

What if the AI actively tracked the latest drops, secret sales, even that impossible-to-get bag that’s always sold out? You just set your budget and taste, and instead of sifting through endless, overwhelming options, the AI surfaces *exactly* what you want, maybe even before you realize you need it.

I mean, we have tech everywhere: 
- AI playlist curators 
- Custom photo filters 
- Personalized news feeds

Why not personalized, luxury gifting? I’d lose my mind if I got an *experience* instead of a coupon!

Visualize it: you get your AI gift card, scan the code, and suddenly you’re ushered into a digital showroom where everything seems tailor-made for you. It could even suggest novels and luxury experiences handpicked by your reading style—seriously, **https://goodnovel.org/** is doing some wicked stuff by blending AI and stories. Imagine that with luxury goods, too!

But here’s where I get a little confused (in an excited way): 
- Would it feel TOO predictive? 
- Is it weird if it knows you *too well*?
- Where would the line be between thoughtful and invasive?

There’s also the killer perk: giving one card and knowing the AI will *never* flop or disappoint the recipient. They might end up with a boutique spa day, a sci-fi page-turner, or that custom coffee setup they only mentioned during brunch once. **One-size-fits-ALL, but somehow still unique? Magic.**

Have any of you seen early versions of this? Do you think AI is up to the “perfect present” challenge yet, or is the human touch still unbeatable?

If this existed, I’d want to send my best friend the world—and suddenly, maybe I *could*. 

PS: If you’re curious about AI and killer recommendations, check out https://goodnovel.org/, it blew my mind what’s possible 💡

Second to last day... here we go

Breakfast 8:30am: (8/10): Spiced apple slices with an oatmeal cookie, broken up and mixed together this is exactly like an apple crumble, there's some warm winter spices, cinnamon, nutmeg I think? The sauce is not stringy or weird, its smooth and the slices have a subtle crispiness. This is an amazing combination that makes for a higher combined score than they would get alone. Plus there's a coffee, excellent breakfast.

Lunch 1pm: (7/10): After a substantial breakfast there's not a whole lot left of this MRE and I dont know what to do about the crackers... Anyway the pizza isn't pepperoni pizza its a weird mutant cheese bread with bacon bits. Its fine considering its shelf stable, I dont hate it but its not pizza and there is a chemical after taste, its also small. I have the same feelings about this as I did for the cheese pizza, it gets a 6 just the same, again thats generous. The chocolate protein shake on the other hand is still an 8.

Dinner 5pm: (3/10): I have a lemonade beverage base which is my favorite beverage base, easy 7 but its companion is a woeful and solitary pack of crackers. Which by themselves score a 1. I dont even think its worth eating them alone, decided to dig out an extra cheese spread to make it bearable. 

Overall Score: 6/10: The overall menu is quite good, there are some fantastic components but the pizza itself is pretty lame. Slightly better than the cheese pizza? But I can't forgive the crackers situation, I'm sure some people will add them to the apple slices and eat the cookie with a coffee but I couldn't bring myself to do that. Is this menu missing a cheese spread? If so we might be looking at a 7... I think the menu is good overall and is worth poaching for the apple slices and beverages.

With a strong coffee in hand, I thought it’d be a good time for some laid-back conversation. I’m into traveling, tech, music, anime, and gaming—CS2 has been a big part of my downtime lately.

I always enjoy meeting new people and hearing the kind of stories that stick with you. If you’re up for a casual chat or just want to share what’s on your mind, I’m all ears.

1mivnha,https://heribertocanocaro.substack.com/p/the-most-dangerous-game-9a7,Chapter 19 Selena,"Selena sat at the coffee shop and worked on Canva to create her next flyer. She sipped her latte and enjoyed the smell of freshly ground coffee that permeated the shop. Conversations bustled throughout as well.

Out of habit, Selena picked up her phone and opened up Instagram. A reel was already loaded. The thumbnail was blurred, but even through the blur, she could make out red. Too much red.

She didn’t hit mute in time.

A scream tore through her phone—a wet, throat-shedding cry. It was followed by a deep, bone-rattling roar. Then the sound of meat tearing.

Selena let out a tiny scream. She dropped her phone as if it had turned into a serpent. A few people gave her confused looks, glanced at the reel, then returned to their conversations. Selena grabbed her phone and muted the clip. The screams were thankfully cut short. She looked at the post and saw some random account had posted the clip.

So why did Selena see it?

She peered closer at the caption and saw Greg’s profile tagged. Greg hadn’t posted anything since his first announcement. So was this real? Why was he tagged in it?

“Hey, are you Selena Moralez?”

The question derailed her train of thought. She looked up to see a bird-chested guy in a dingy black t-shirt. He was rail-thin, pale, maybe mid-twenties, with sun-bleached blonde hair that looked like it hadn’t been washed in days. His smile was just a little too wide. His entire vibe was off—something about him felt…sus.

“Yes,” Selena answered hesitantly.

Nine out of ten times when someone—especially a guy from this particular demographic—approached Selena, he wanted to know one of three things: was she single, was she over Greg’s Valentine’s Day prank, or did she know when Greg was going to post his next video? She usually hoped it was the first since it was easier to shoot down.

“My name’s Jagger. I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions for my Reddit post on Greg.”

This isn’t going to be good.

Selena motioned to pack her bags. “I really can’t. I have another meeting to get to.”

“Please, just one question,” Jagger pleaded. “And I’m not Greg’s handler.” Selena declared. “Let alone his girlfriend anymore.”

Selena stood up, waiting for the inevitable.

Jagger leaned forward, eyes bright with that same unsettling intensity. “How did Greg train a bear? Those special effects looked wicked. They must’ve been so high-quality Instagram couldn’t tell if it was real or not.”

Selena blinked. “I don’t follow. And I really gotta go.”

“T-the video,” he stammered. “The one you just watched. People don’t know if it’s real or not. I think it is. But everyone’s going bonkers. They think this is gonna be Greg’s biggest video ever.”

Selena’s stomach dropped.

Jagger spoke with the passion of someone who had watched Jesus get baptized in person. “Me and three buddies are gonna head into the woods tomorrow night to see if we can find him. That million dollars is definitely gonna be ours.”

His grin widened. For a split second, it almost looked like he was drooling.

Selena clutched her bag and rushed out of the coffee shop. She held a napkin to her mouth, hyperventilating as she tried to stifle her sobs.

Somehow, she knew the video was real.

Somehow, she knew Greg was in trouble.

So for context I (25m) became the caregiver of my grandmother 2 years ago after my parents passed away in a car accident. After that I had to do some training to become the full time paid caregiver of my grandmother. She is able to move around most of the time but she has her struggles as she has post polio and Alzheimer’s. 

So 2 months ago I went on vacation for the first time in years and my brother took care of her, normally I stay in my room until she gets up to take her medicine then I walk out, if she has any troubles then she has a button she can press and a doorbell noise will go off and I will know to go out. My brother didn’t know this routine and staying in and watched tv with her which was fine until I came home and she guilt tripped me into staying in with her. So now I am stay up until 11 watching the Walton’s. I have no resentment towards my grandmother I truly and Deeply love her by the way. 

I made plans with one of my old friends who I haven’t seen since high school and was really excited to see. The plan was that I were to wake up at 6, drive an hour to meet him get coffee for 3 hours then drive back, meanwhile my brother will be there if anything is wrong but she doesn’t wake up until 10 anyway. The night before though it was 10:45 and I wanted to go to bed early, if anything was wrong I was right next to where she takes her meds and she can press her button. I told her that I was going to bad and she said can’t you said 15 minutes, I responded thinking she couldn’t oh my god shut up and let me sleep. 

I totally regretted saying it right after and especially after I knew she heard. She called my brother and told him and he came to stay until I can “control my attitude” like I’m a toddler. I am a full grown adult and a full time caregiver giver and they are treating me like I’m 5. My brother is older than me but still, when he left for college he didn’t even know that metal could go in the microwave now he is acting like my parent.

1mivn8z,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1mivn8z/tarot/,Tarot,"I was walking with a friend in Germany  in 2023 when he asked me if I want my future to be read, so I asked the usual: career but be focused on Love. He shuffled the cards and he said that I will meet him far away… not from the place I knew half of my life. 

At first I was puzzled… where? i did traveled a lot but where?y friend told me it could be in an airport, restaurant, coffee shop or club but again reiterated that my soon to be husband will not come from the place I am so familiar with.. the east. 

So I asked when will I meet him? He said it will take long… Years… I must admit I got little disappointed because I want to be married soon but he said It will never happen until I accomplished the things in my career since I am skilled, talented and beautiful not only on superficially but skin deep. 

My tarot reader friend then said: Don’t worry because it will happen. He is there waiting. 


Gosh. It means at least for me, that there will be no games, second or hundredth guessing. He’s there waiting. Patiently. 




We will lead the way. From our 2 colored strings.

So following ending my lease, I heavily followed the rec’s of everyone on here. Left the place spick and span, and claimed my $3000 bond the second I dropped off the keys. Wasn’t invited to a walk through but a few days later I got the dreaded REA email. Clearly they were pissed I claimed my bond and tried to threaten me saying they were filling at NCAT that morning. They said the walls need repainted and the carpet needs replaced because it’s unfair to the landlord who now has to fix it before he sells it. 
Now this is where I might have messed up. I asked them how they could file without a quote? She backtracked. She said they were replacing the whole carpet - I said I’m only liable for marks past fair wear and tear not the whole thing. She depreciation happens only after 5 years - I corrected her and said it’s 10% per year. 
Almost a week goes by, I thought they have decided to leave me alone. Nope! My bond is due to be released in 3 days and now they have filed a claim for the full amount (I have still not received a quote). 
I expected more of a back and forth debate before this point. I was mentally prepared to offer $250 because my toddler did kick over a cup of coffee or 2. I reallllyyyy needed that bond payment in a few days. Has anyone recently been to NCAT? ",6,1754455950.0,shitrentals,2,0.88,False
1mivlky,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1mivlky/death_and_the_girl_next_door_novel_by_darynda/,Death and the Girl Next Door Novel by Darynda Jones Free Read online," The small town of Riley’s Switch, New Mexico, had only one coffeehouse, so that’s where I sat with my two best friends, knowing beyond a shadow of a doubt that only two of us would make it out of there alive. Though I did tend to exaggerate.  
  
  The fresh scent of pine from the surrounding mountains, which mingled with the rich aroma of coffee, lingered forgotten. In its place was a tense silence. It thickened the air around us. Emotions soared and rage simmered as I glowered at the traitor sitting across from me, waiting for him to flinch, to cower under my scrutiny. I would make his life a living heck if it were the last thing I did. Mostly because I wasn’t allowed to use the word Hell, being the granddaughter of a pastor and all. Otherwise, Casey Niyol Blue-Spider, aka the Glitch, would be toast.  
  
  “I swear, Lorelei,” he said, caving at last as a telling bead of sweat trickled down his temple, “I didn’t take it.” He shifted nervously in his seat and scanned the Java Loft, most likely to see if anyone was paying attention to the unscrupulous activities going on right under their noses. Since we were the only patrons in the place, probably not. “And even if I did, and I’m not saying I did,” he added, jabbing an index finger toward me, “who the heck cares?”  
  
  I lowered my voice, controlled the tone and inflection of every word, every syllable, striving to make myself sound menacing. I took up a mere five feet of vertical air space, so menacing was not always easy for me to accomplish. Slipping into a cryptic grin, I said, “You realize the minute I touch your hand, I’ll know the truth.”  
  
  His gaze darted to the hand he’d wrapped around his whipped almond toffee cappuccino with nonfat milk, and he jerked it back out of my reach. His hand. Not the whipped almond toffee cappuccino with nonfat milk.  
  
  My best friend Brooklyn leaned in to me and whispered, “You know he accidentally deleted seventeen songs off your classic rock playlist, right? And he used your toothbrush once without asking.” She glared at him, the contempt in her eyes undeniable. “I say make the traitor squirm.”  
  
  Glitch’s jaw tightened, and I could sense his inevitable defeat like a dog senses fear.  
  
  “Tag-teaming?” he asked, indignant. “Isn’t that a little unsportsmanlike?”  
  
  “Not for a couple of heartless dames like us,” Brooklyn said.  
  
  I turned to her with a smile. “Oh, my god, I love it when you talk pulp-fiction detective.”  
  
  “I know, right?” she said, her dark skin and brown eyes a picture of joy.  
  
  Brooke and I met when we threw down in the third grade. By the end of my first and only catfight, I had a few missing hairs, a broken fingernail, and a new best friend. And we were practically twins. If not for the fact that she had long sable hair, chestnut skin, and light brown eyes, and I had curly auburn hair, pasty white skin, and eyes the bizarre color of chimney smoke, people would never be able to tell us apart. Probably because we were both exactly five feet tall. Not a centimeter more. Not a centimeter less. It was eerie.  
  
  In choreographed unison, we refocused on the slimeball sitting across from us.  
  
  “Spill,” she said.  
  
  “Okay, sheesh.” He pushed back his cappuccino and folded his arms over his chest, a defensive gesture that only added fuel to my suspicions. “I admit it. I had a copy of the test beforehand, but I didn’t steal it.”  
  
  “I knew you cheated.” I reached across the table and whacked him on the arm. Thankfully, Glitch wasn’t much bigger than either of us, so the punch quite possibly registered somewhere deep in the scary depths of his boy mind. Or that was my hope, anyway. “You blew the curve, Glitch.”  
  
  Guilt washed over him. I could tell by the thin line of his lips, the chin tucked  
in shame.  
  
  “You’re such a wiener,” Brooklyn said. “I really needed those extra points.”  
  
  “And where on planet Earth did you get a copy of the test?” I had to admit, I was more than a little astonished. And a tad jealous.  
  
  He shook his head. “No way. I’m not giving up my source. And besides, you both got B’s. It’s not like you failed the stupid thing.”  
  
  Brooklyn reached over, curled a fist into his T-shirt, and pulled him forward until their noses were mere inches apart. “Clearly you do not understand the innate intricacies and often illogical drives of an A freak.” She let go, disgusted. “I hate your guts.”  
  
  “No, you don’t.” He took a swig of his cappuccino, unconcerned.  
  
  Like Brooklyn, Glitch was a bona fide child of two nations, with dark, coppery skin from his Native American father and hazel green eyes, compliments of his Irish-American mother. And thanks to a compromise between the two, he had the coolest name on earth: Casey Niyol Blue-Spider. The mix of ethnicities gave him a rich, enigmatic attraction. Though he hardly needed to, he kept his short black hair spiked with blond highlights in an attempt to make himself seem wild and unpredictable, which was always good for a laugh. Glitch was about as wild and unpredictable as a carrot stick. Though he did have an unnatural fear of turtles that was interesting.  
  
  “You’re just intimidated by my manly physique.”  
  
  Brooke snorted. “This coming from a boy who’s barely tall enough to get on the roller coaster at the state fair without a permission slip from his parents.”  
  
  His grin took on an evil luster. “Least I get on, short pants.”  
  
  “Oh yeah? Well, at least I wasn’t voted most likely to acquire gainful employment as Santa’s elf.”  
  
  “Guys, guys,” I said, holding up my hands for a cease-fire. “We can’t fling short jokes at each other when we’re all short. It’s just not effective.”  
  
  “That’s true,” Brooklyn said in disappointment.  
  
  “No, it’s not. I am three, count them, three”—he held up three fingers for us to count—“inches taller than the likes of you two. I can’t believe I’m willing to be seen in public with either of you.”  
  
  “Glitch,” Brooklyn said, a warning edge in her voice, “I will stab you in the face if you ever speak to me again.”  
  
  He squinted at her, completely unmoved, then turned to me and asked, “So, did your grandmother get her computer running?”  
  
  “No. You’re just going to have to stop by sometime and fix it.”  
  
  “Cool.” He smiled in anticipation. “What’s for dinner tonight?”  
  
  I knew he’d do that. Brooke had already invited herself over, claiming she needed to upload her assignment because the Internet at her house was down. Glitch would come over, fix my grandmother’s computer in about ten minutes, and then my two best friends would spend the rest of the evening keeping me company.  
  
  It was the same every year. For a week before until a week after the anniversary of my parents’ disappearance, they spent almost every waking moment with me, watching over me, seeing to my every need. They were amazing. I’m not sure what they thought I would do if left alone—I’d never been particularly suicidal—but they were the dearest friends a girl could ask for. The air seemed to turn dreary this time of year, thick and heavy, so having them around did help. And I totally loved being waited on hand and foot, so naturally I milked it for all it was worth.  
  
  The bell jingled, announcing a new customer before I could answer Glitch, but I was busy prying my fingers apart anyway. I’d spilled mocha cappuccino over them—hot mocha cappuccino—when I tried to add a sprinkle of cinnamon earlier, and few things were more disturbing than sticky fingers. Forest fires, perhaps. And people who claimed to have been abducted by aliens.  
  
  “I have to wash my hands before we go.”  
  
  “Okay.” Brooklyn rummaged through her bag and pulled out her phone for a quick check as I scooted out of the booth, grateful for the excuse. For some reason, the fact that my parents had been gone almost ten years exactly, like some kind of milestone anniversary, had me more melancholy than usual. “I’ll keep an eye on the traitor,” Brooke continued, “until we can decide what to do with him.”  
  
  “Do you need ideas?” Glitch asked, turning feisty. “I know lots of things you could do to me.”  
  
  “Do any of them involve piano wire and a razor blade?”  
  
  I laughed to myself and headed toward the back of our favorite and pretty much only hangout. It sat a mere block from our alma mater, Riley High, and we practically lived in our corner booth. I ducked past the snack counter and into a very dark back hall. Judging by the boxes lining the narrow passage, I’d be taking my life into my hands if I risked a journey to the little señorita’s room without illumination, so I ran my hand along a paneled wall. Where would I be if I were a light switch? Just as the tips of my fingers found the switch, a silhouette stepped out of the shadows and brushed past me. I startled with a gasp.  
  
  “Excuse me,” I said, placing a hand over my heart.  
  
  “Sorry.” The guy paused slightly before continuing on his way, and in that instant, I saw the makings of utter perfection: a long arm with shadowy curves that dipped around the fluid lines of muscle; a tall, wide shoulder; dark hair that curled playfully over an ear and led to a strong, masculine jaw. Something inside me lurched, craving a closer look at his face, but he walked by too fast and the hall was too dark for me to catch anything else.  
  
  After a couple of seconds, I realized my hand had brushed against his arm. It was enough to send a vision crashing into me, like the flash of a nuclear bomb, bright and unforgiving. Tamping down my surprise—I hadn’t had a vision in a very long time—I pressed shaking fingers to my forehead to wait out the familiar storm, to see what treasures would wash ashore in the aftermath.  
  
  Yet the things I saw were unreal, impossible, and certainly not of this world: A desolate landscape lay before me with scorched clouds and a roiling, violet sky. The air was stagnant and so impossibly thick, breathing it took effort. Then I heard the clanging of metal. I turned to watch in horror as a being, a boy of no more than sixteen or seventeen, fierce and somehow not quite human, struggled with a dark, monstrous beast. The boy’s arms corded as tendon and muscle strained against the weight of the sword he wielded. He slashed again and again, but the monster was fast, with razorlike talons and sharp, gleaming teeth, and the boy knew what those teeth felt like when they sank into flesh, knew the blinding pain that accompanied defeat. But he also knew the power he himself wielded, the raw strength that saturated every molecule of his body.  
  
  Another herculean effort landed a thrust in the monster’s shoulder and continued through its thick chest. The monster sank under the boy’s sword with a guttural scream. The boy looked on while the beast writhed in pain, watched it grow still as the life drained out of it, and somewhere in the back of the boy’s mind, he allowed himself to register the burning of his lungs as he struggled to fill them with air.  
  
  Blood trickled between his fingers, down the length of his blade, and dripped to the powdery earth beneath his feet. I followed the trail of blood up to three huge gashes across his chest. Evidently three of the monster’s claws had met their mark, laying the flesh of its enemy open. I gasped and covered my mouth with both hands as the boy spun toward me, sword at the ready. Squinting against the low sun, I could almost make out his features, but the vision evaporated before I got the chance. A heartbeat later, I was back in the dark hallway, gasping for air, one palm pressed against my temple, the other against the wall for balance.  
  
  I squeezed my eyes shut, fought the memory of the vision, the fear that summoned the taste of bile in the back of my throat, the feel of blood dripping down the boy’s arm.  
  
  Ever since I could remember, I had a tendency to see random flashes of inconsequential situations in my head, which, by definition, could point to any number of debilitating diseases. I wasn’t psychic or anything. I couldn’t conjure visions whenever I wanted. Images just see  
med to crystallize in my mind out of nowhere, and at the most inopportune times too, shimmering like reflections off water. Sometimes they were just flashes of nonsense, glimpses of the impossible, like a rip in the afternoon sky that let night seep through. Nothing ever came of those.  
  
  But sometimes the visions either had been or would be, as though I could see into both the past and the future. Like the one time I accidentally saw into the past after touching my grandfather’s hand. He had been a thousand miles away, and I caught a glimpse of the first time he laid eyes on Grandma. She’d tucked a strand of hair behind her ear as she walked to class with her friends, only to have the wind toss it back across her face. She laughed and tried again, and I felt the tug of interest in Grandpa the minute it hit him.  
  
  The ability rocked, I admit. But never in my life had I seen anything with so much punch, so much texture.  
  
  I hurried to the bathroom and splashed cold water on my face. Clearly that had been one of those flashes of nonsense. But it seemed so real. I could feel the weight of the air, the depletion of the boy’s energy as he fought, his limbs shaking from exertion and from adrenaline as it pumped through his powerful body.  
  
  I blinked and forced myself back to the present, forced myself to calm. Stepping back into the hall, I glanced around in search of the dark-headed boy, to no avail. Disappointment washed over me. For one thing, I wanted a better look. For another, I wanted a better look. The first was for obvious girl reasons. Those arms. That jaw. Who could blame me? The second was because of what I’d just seen. Surely my vision was metaphorical in some way. Scorched clouds in violet skies didn’t exist. And thankfully, neither did that beast.  
  
  I must’ve been in the restroom longer than I’d thought. Brooke and Glitch were waiting for me outside. But I couldn’t get those images out of my head. I’d never seen anything like them in my life.  
  
  As I grabbed my backpack with a shaking hand, I sensed someone watching. I turned to see Cameron Lusk sitting in a booth, his shoulder-length blond hair visible even in the shadowy corner. Though we lived in a small town and Cameron and I were in the same sophomore class, we hadn’t spoken in forever. He was more the loner type, scowling at anyone who tried to communicate with him. But still, he was right there. It would be rude of me not to acknowledge his surly existence.

Hey, Cameron,” I said as I fished a tip out of my bag and turned back to our table.  
  
  “Your friends already left a tip,” the barista said from behind the counter. “See you tomorrow.” She grinned at me, knowing I’d be back. If I remembered correctly, she’d graduated a couple of years earlier and had gone off to college in Albuquerque. Must not have worked out, since she was now a barista in a small-town coffee shop. Or it worked out perfectly, and she’d gone to college to become a barista in a small-town coffee shop. Hard to imagine, but okay.  
  
  “See ya,” I said before glancing at Cameron again. He took the whole brooding thing way too seriously. The glare he’d graced me with could have frozen heck itself. “See you tomorrow, Cameron.”  
  
  He lifted a finger in acknowledgment. I felt oddly honored.  
  
  “What took you so long?” Brooklyn asked as I stepped into the late-afternoon sun. New Mexico was nothing if not sunny, even where we lived in the Manzano Mountains.  
  
  “Did you see that boy?” I asked, scanning the street.  
  
  “Cameron?” Brooklyn asked. If the distaste wasn’t clear in her tone, the wrinkling of her nose would have said it all.  
  
  “No, a dark-haired boy, tall and really, really muscular.”  
  
  Brooklyn jumped to attention and joined me in the search, turning every which way. “What boy? I didn’t see a boy. Especially not a tall, dark, and muscular one.”  
  
  Glitch peered in through the coffee shop window. “I didn’t see anyone either. Maybe you imagined him.”  
  
  “I had a vision,” I said breathlessly, and two sets of eyes widened on me. I knew we’d spend the rest of the evening talking about what I’d seen. If my vision was even remotely authentic, something very dreadful was about to happen to that boy.  
  
  SUPERNOVA  
  
  Three days later, I found myself struggling against both melancholy and euphoria. But if I’d known my day was going to suck like a turbo-powered Hoover, I totally would’ve faked the flu and stayed home. Or chicken pox. Or malaria. Instead, I’d walked to school like it was any other day. Like my heart wasn’t breaking. Like my head wasn’t reeling and my feet weren’t weighted down by the sudden and tragic onset of clinical depression, making each breath a trial, each step a struggle. I totally needed a car.  
  
  I walked along Main Street, past trees and small businesses geared more toward tourists than locals, until my high school came into sight. Riley High was the latest and greatest achievement of the Riley’s Switch Board of Education. It was sparkling and new with stone arches that would’ve looked more at home in an architectural magazine than in a small New Mexico town. Heavy plate-glass windows lined the front with arched pillars at the entrance. The whole thing was topped off with a scarlet dome, like a castle tucked into the mountainside. Several outbuildings encircled the school, including the gym, the agricultural and construction shops, and the cafeteria. I had to admit, when I started here my freshman year, the place intimidated me more than a little. But I adjusted quickly when I realized how much the boys had grown over the summer. High school was a grand place to be.  
  
  I spotted Brooklyn in the sea of students rushing to class and zigzagged toward her. Hugging my notebook to my chest, I took turns dodging a group of wrestlers practicing their chosen profession in the hallway and barely escaping with my life when a linebacker decided to plunge through the crush of bodies.  
  
  Who knew high school could be so dangerous?  
  
  Brooklyn was busy dialing the combination on her locker. She glanced at me between spins. “Hey, you.”  
  
  “Hey.” I leaned against the wall of bright red lockers and asked, “Do you remember what today is?”  
  
  She stopped midspin, her dark visage puckering in soft admonishment. “Of course I do. How could I not?”  
  
  I shrugged and glanced down. It was weird. I figured the tenth anniversary of my parents’ disappearance would be excruciating. Like if I’d broken a leg or gotten a really bad paper cut. Instead, the pain in my chest was more like a whisper bouncing off the walls of an empty cavern. I just woke up and they were still gone. Like they had been every other morning for the last ten years.  
  
  At first their absence had seemed like a dream, but the depth of despair my grandparents fell into convinced me they were really gone. And everyone asked me questions. What happened? What were we doing there? What did I see? Nothing, I would tell them. Again and again, nothing. I didn’t understand why they were asking me questions I couldn’t possibly have the answers to, but they said I’d been with my parents when they disappeared. The police found me unconscious beside our car at the old Pueblo ruins outside of Riley’s Switch. I didn’t remember being there. I just remembered waking up in the hospital days later, my body so heavy, I could barely move, my lungs so thick, I could barely breathe. And no one had any explanation as to why.  
  
  Then came the questions. Over and over until my grandparents, in their state of utter bereavement, ordered the authorities to stop and took me home to grieve. I found out later that the entire town had helped look for my parents. Search parties scouted for days, hunted for clues. Even the FBI showed up, but nothing was ever found. Not a single shred of evidence. As cliché as it sounded, they literally vanished without a trace.  
  
  The official report stated that my parents had wandered off and lost their way back. But they would never have done that. They would never have left me. And yet, because there was no evidence of foul play, the investigation lasted only a couple of weeks.  
  
  And I, the only one who could offer any explanation, could remember nothing. The guilt of that fact weighed on me more and more every year, like a jagged boulder in my chest that grew with each passing moment.  
  
  I’d never told anyone about the guilt except for Brooke.  
  
  Her eyes filled with sympathy. “Why didn’t you stay home?”  
  
  “And wallow in a deep pit of despair alone when I could force you to wallow with me? No, thank you.”  
  
  She nodded. “That’s a good point. I’m pretty good at wallowing.”  
  
  “And,” I said, withdrawing inside myself just a little, “I have something awful to confess.”  
  
  “Yeah?” Intrigue scooted her closer. “How awful?”  
  
  I hugged my notebook tighter and said, “I keep thinking about that boy from the Java Loft. For three days, that boy and that vision.”  
  
  A knowing smile softened her face. “And you feel guilty?”  
  
  “Absolutely. Don’t you think I should?”  
  
  “No.”  
  
  “I mean, here I am, practically orphaned ten years to the day, and my mind keeps replaying that vision over and over in my head. I’ve never seen anything like it. Or felt anything like it, for that matter. He was so fierce, so desperate, and yet somehow not quite human.” I took in a deep breath and refocused on Brooke. “But to think about that on today of all days.”  
  
  She put a hand on my arm. “Lor, I’m certain your parents wouldn’t want you wallowing for their sake.”  
  
  “I know, but—”  
  
  “No buts. I can’t even begin to imagine what it’s like to have your gift, to see the things you’ve seen and feel the things you’ve felt. I understand where you’re coming from, but if you really loved me, you’d describe that boy in much more detail and include pertinent information like chest measurements and white blood cell count.”  
  
  I grinned playfully and leaned in closer. “Well, I did try my hand at drawing him.”  
  
  Her smile widened. “And?”  
  
  After a quick scan of the area to make sure no one was looking, I eased my notebook forward to reveal my latest masterpiece.  
  
  Her stare locked on to the image I’d drawn. The boy from the vision. She inhaled a soft breath. “Oh, my.”  
  
  “I know.” I’d caught only a fraction of his face during the fight. Dark eyes one instant. A strong jaw the next. Lashes, thick and impossibly long. So I didn’t really have that much to go on, but I drew what I remembered.  
  
  “Is the boy in your vision the same one from the hall?”  
  
  “Prob  
ably,” I answered. “At least that’s how it usually works. But how could that even be possible?”  
  
  “Beats the heck outta me.”  
  
  “Maybe my vision was a metaphor for something he has to face in his life. Something awful.”  
  
  “Like finals?”  
  
  “Exactly. Only, you know, more life-threatening.”  
  
  A slow nod confirmed her agreement. “Maybe. I know one thing: He’s absolutely gorgeous.” She leveled an approving eye on me. “You are getting seriously good at this stuff. You should sell your drawings on eBay and pay for a trip to the casinos. Put those skills to good use.”  
  
  Brooklyn knew my glimpses into the Twilight Zone didn’t really work that way. I wasn’t psychic like that. I just saw things every so often when I touched people. There were no guarantees that what I saw actually happened, or ever would.  
  
  “I only use my powers for good,” I said, offering her a teasing scowl.  
  
  She threw me a doubtful look. “What about that time the creature whose name shall not be spoken aloud backed her car into Principal Davis’s SUV? You saw that two days before it happened.”  
  
  “Oh, right, well, most of the time. But this vision was different. So much emotion. So much turmoil.”  
  
  “So much hot guy flesh,” Brooke added.  
  
  I studied the picture and realized I did focus on the guy’s muscles a bit, but that was mostly what I saw.  
  
  “So you didn’t see his whole face?” she asked, commenting on the fact that I’d only drawn his dark eyes with long lashes and the barest sliver of his pout.  
  
  “No.” I sighed in frustration. “I got bits and pieces. It was like a puzzle I couldn’t quite solve.”  
  
  “And you’re not very good at puzzles.”  
  
  “True.” I fixed a contrite look on her as she analyzed the picture. “Sorry I called you so late last night.”  
  
  “Are you kidding? I would’ve been upset if you hadn’t called me. Being stalked sucks,” she said, referring to the fact that for the last three days, ever since I’d seen him in the Java Loft, Cameron Lusk had been following me. Just out of the blue. For no comprehensible reason whatsoever. Every time I turned a corner, every time I looked up from whatever I was doing, there he was. Glaring. “Maybe what you saw in your vision was a manifestation of your worry over Cameron.”  
  
  “Maybe.” I hadn’t thought of it that way. I was pretty new to the whole stalking thing.  
  
  She opened her red locker door then halted again. “Well, let’s think about it. You had that vision the same day Cameron started following you.”

My grandmother died three months ago.

We buried her on a Thursday. It rained the whole day, the kind of rain that makes you feel like the world’s crying harder than you are. After the funeral, I got home, sat on the couch, and stared at nothing for an hour. That’s when I noticed it: a sealed envelope sticking out of my mailbox.

No stamp. No handwriting. No return address.

Inside was a card, written in a style I instantly recognized. My grandmother’s handwriting.

“Congrats on the new job. You start Monday at 9:00. – Love, Grandma.”

I thought someone was playing a twisted joke. My grandmother had been in hospice care for over a year—bedridden, barely speaking. She hadn’t written anything in months.

I ignored it at first. Then Monday came.

At exactly 7:42 a.m., my alarm clock went off. I hadn’t set it. When I walked into the kitchen, there was a neon green sticky note on the fridge:

“You’re going to love Human Resources. Bring an umbrella.”

Now, here’s the thing: I live alone. I’ve never told anyone about that letter. And I don’t own neon green sticky notes.

Still, I grabbed an umbrella and left the apartment.

The address from the envelope led me downtown—to a building I swear I’d never noticed before. Seventeen stories tall, no sign, no logo, no name. Just a rusted plaque next to the door:

“Department of Pending Processes and Apparently Useless Tasks (DPPAUT)”

Inside: white walls, white ceiling, white floor. Everything echoing with silence.

At the reception desk, a man in a grey vest smiled at me.

“You must be the new hire,” he said before I could introduce myself. “Coffee?”

I nodded, unsure, and watched as he poured steaming coffee… directly from a photocopier.

“It’s Colombian,” he added, as if that explained anything.

I blinked. “Wait—was that—did you just—?”

He slid a small package across the desk, wrapped in deep purple tape.

“This is yours. You left it here on September 6, 2028. Today’s the return date.”

“That’s… three years from now.”

He didn’t respond.

Inside the package: 
•	A wristwatch with no hands. 
•	A magnetic ID card with my photo (I never took that photo). 
•	A leather-bound notepad with one page written: “When everyone knows your date, you won’t know theirs.” 
•	A sticky note: “Yes, the office has a normal coffee machine. But you always liked the copier.”

The man looked at me. “You’ll want to get upstairs. The elevator already knows.”

I turned. The elevator doors had opened on their own. Inside, the floor indicator displayed something impossible:

“Welcome, Employee #2937. Department: Future Correspondence. Floor 7 ¾.”

I stepped inside, because what else was I supposed to do?

As the elevator moved in silence, I stared at my reflection. Same face, same eyes—but everything suddenly felt… misaligned. Like I was standing in a life I hadn’t lived yet.

Tomorrow, I’m supposed to meet my team.

Apparently, according to the notepad, one of them already hates me. For something I haven’t even done.",2,1754455228.0,shortstories,3,1.0,False

Olefin and Sunbrella fabrics are popular choices for outdoor cushions due to their resistance to fading, stains, and mildew. The thickness and density of the cushions contribute to overall comfort and support, ensuring a pleasant seating experience.

I have found the place that has haunted my dreams these many weeks - a place no mere “archive” could hope to describe without grievous injustice.

It is something far beyond that mundane epithet; a locus of eldritch significance that defies the very limits of mortal comprehension. A realm not fashioned for human eyes, existing beyond the fragile boundaries we call space and time.

I shall recount how I came upon it, and what horrors I discovered therein.

On the night I read of Sarah’s suicide, I retired to bed, burdened by a crushing and paralytic guilt - an oppressive weight that gnawed deep within my chest. I felt responsible. I still do. I tossed and turned long into the night before an uneasy sleep overcame me.

And, as so often in those accursed weeks, I found myself once again within that uncanny place - the dream I knew like an old, sinister acquaintance.

There I stood, amidst the labyrinthine archive beyond our world - a sprawling catacomb of time, decay, and memory. A realm reeking of musty paper and rot, its walls composed of endless, worm-ridden shelves that ascended into dizzying heights lost within impenetrable darkness above. Corridors multiplied, innumerable, convoluted beyond all geometry, encircling me with maddening complexity.

But this time, something was different. Before I saw it, I felt it - a weight in my hands, cold and familiar. When I glanced downward, Sarah’s book rested there.

There was a presence about it, more tangible than ever - as if it belonged here, in this impossible archive.

At that moment, I knew with a certainty that chilled my soul: there was a place in this eldritch vault reserved solely for that volume. A single, solitary slot destined for that one copy.

And I had to find it.

So I wandered. Hours passed as I traversed the endless aisles. The faint, familiar whispering followed me - a ceaseless stream of words in no human tongue.

Above me - always above me - was the unnerving sensation of eyes upon me. Eyes I never glimpsed, but whose gaze I felt as a palpable weight. They were no eyes of mortal men. Invisible, yet crushingly present - shadows cast by something beyond human ken.

I cannot say how long I roamed those dark, infinite halls before I rounded a corner - and suddenly halted.

Before me stood a shelf. At first glance, no different than the others: towering, worm-eaten, laden with books all bound in the same black, leathery hide. But amidst them yawned a vacant space - a single empty place.

I knew, without thought, that this was Sarah’s place. The place for what remained of her.

With a strange sensation, I lifted the book and slipped it into the void.

No sooner had I done so than something changed around me. The whispering that had long accompanied me swelled - no longer distant or unintelligible, but close. Too close. It was as though a voice slid beside my ear - not one of words, but a raw, inhuman sound.

I froze. Every fiber of my being expected something - a sign, a movement, a response. But nothing came.

Slowly, the whispering receded, like a tide withdrawing into the black sea.

The moment passed. The place was silent once more.

I breathed shallowly, as if only now realizing I had held my breath.

I turned from the shelf and stepped forward. But I moved no further.
For at that precise instant… I awoke. Bathed in sweat, heart pounding - returned to my apartment, to a world that felt more alien with each passing day.

I rose mechanically, showered, dressed, brewed coffee, and prepared a quick breakfast. But something was different.

It felt as though a step had been skipped, as though some vital piece of the day had been forgotten - like a man suddenly unsure whether he locked his door or turned off his stove.

A dull, gnawing emptiness clung to every motion.

Only when I sat at my small kitchen table, cup in hand, staring into the still-dark morning silence, did I grasp it: The book.

I had left it the night before in that dream - within that impossible, alien archive - and now it was gone from my coffee table.

It was… gone. And I ought to have felt relief.

But I did not. On the contrary, it felt wrong - disturbing, even. In recent weeks, I had come to ritualize that book each morning, opening it before coffee to follow Sarah’s story…

I had woven her tale into my daily life - a strange, eerie ritual, familiar and haunting. Without it, the day felt hollow.

I stared at my trembling coffee. Was this the end? Had returning the book meant closure?

A thought pressed on me, one I had long denied: Should I go to the police? I leaned back, staring at the ceiling. What would I say? That I had read of a woman I did not know, in a book that should not exist?
That the book changed, sought me out, filling my dreams with visions too real to be dreams?

That a young woman whose fate I tracked on yellowed pages was dead - and that somehow, I felt responsible?

No. They would not believe me. No one would. I would sound mad - someone in desperate need of help, but not from the law.

So I let it be. I forced myself to go on. To rise, pack my bag, go to work.

Yet even as I turned the key in the library lock, heard the familiar click, breathed the cool, dusty air of the reading room, the emptiness inside me lingered.

I carried on with my day. For the first time in weeks, I felt truly present - not lost in a yellowed page, not half in reality, half in a nightmarish liminal world. No.

I was there. Body and mind - almost whole. Yet that void remained.

No weight in my bag, no unspoken expectation of what the book might reveal. No new passage, no fragment of Sarah’s life devouring mine.

It was over. And it felt neither good nor bad. I cannot say how to describe it.

As though a boulder had rolled from my chest - replaced by an empty box. Lighter, yet hollow.

The library was as always - the same familiar routines: powering scanners, processing returns, checking labels, shelving, tweaking catalog entries. 

For the first time in weeks, I could truly focus. No whispering shadows. No tugging pain in my mind. Only me - and the books.

Mrs. Brandt noticed first. She paused at the reception where I was sorting books, smiling with surprise. “You’re quite industrious today,” she said, half amused, half surprised. “Almost as if you feel well.”

I nodded faintly, returning the smile. I had no words for what I felt.
Only this: It was the first time in long weeks no pitying, worried gaze met mine.

Later, Lena remarked as we re-labeled an old collection. “Wow,” she said, “you seem… clearer today. Dunno, different. Did something good happen?”

“I just slept well,” I said. Nothing better came to mind.

The day passed smoothly. Check-ins and outs, inventory, a few queries from students seeking lost literature.

I answered with surprising clarity - calm, kind, almost free. Lena cast me puzzled looks as if unable to believe how normal I seemed. Mrs. Brandt too left promptly, with an almost relieved smile.

As I walked the top floor later, checking windows closed, I was alone in the library. I liked it that way. The silence was thick here - not unpleasant, but like a warm cloth draped over the shoulders.

My footsteps echoed softly on ancient wooden boards.The smell of paper, wood, and dust hung in the air - familiar scents of order, knowledge, safety. Safety - a feeling long forgotten.

Then I stopped. I was nearing the last door - the main exit. The key was already in my hand. But my gaze fell upon the return box beside the desk.

It was empty. Of course - I'd emptied it earlier. Yet still…

I approached, leaned close, peered into the narrow slot as if something might lie hidden I had missed. And in that moment it struck me with terrible force: I cannot simply go on. Not as if nothing had happened.
Not as if all this - Sarah, the book, the whispering - were a closed chapter.

For I knew it. Felt it. It was not over. Worse: it was real.

All those nights wandering that endless, decaying archive. The shelves, the whispering, the eyes watching me unseen. It was no dream. Never was.

I had only suppressed it - as one forgets one’s shadow in the presence of light.

But now, in this silence, in this moment between breaths, I knew it: The archive exists. And I must find it. I must uncover what it is. What secrets it holds. Why it calls to me.

Slowly, I laid my hand upon the light switch - but did not turn it off. I simply stood, sensing something stirring deep within. Something that would not rest. Not until I had found the archive.

This thought struck me with a clarity so terrifying it seemed it had slumbered there forever, waiting only for the right moment. And with it came the terrible realization: The archive must be here. Somewhere in this very library.

Why else had the book appeared here? Why else did every room in this building seem permeated by a presence beyond comprehension?

I was alone. Certain of it. Outside, the city had fallen silent; only the hum of street lamps and distant traffic murmured through the windows.

I searched every corner. I do not even know what I sought. A hidden door behind a shelf, triggered by pulling a certain book. A trapdoor beneath the carpet. A fissure in the wall, a crack between cellar stones. Something. Anything.

But the library remained mute. The shelves stood as always - ancient, dark wood warped by age. The floor creaked in its usual spots. No door appeared. No secret passage opened.

I knocked on walls, moved shelves, lifted rugs. And found… nothing. Only dust and silence.

Eventually, I gave up. Not from conviction - but fatigue. Both physical and… spiritual.

I locked up, left the library, and went home. The night was cool. A gentle breeze stirred the alley trees, rustling leaves like whispering voices.

Home was quiet. I switched on the light, set down my bag, shed my jacket. And for the first time in weeks, I felt something almost frightening: hunger.

A true, bodily need - not the vague, suppressed sensation I had masked with coffee and forced meals.

I prepared a simple supper - bread, a few olives, cheese. It tasted surprisingly good. I drank a glass of water, sat still at the kitchen table, letting the day fade from my mind.

Then I showered, changed into an old soft shirt, and lay down. No book. No rumination. Only darkness - and sleep.

When I opened my eyes again, I stood in the archive. But not the other one. Not the endless, decayed, whispering archive of my dreams. No.

This was my archive. The one I knew. The real one. And yet… something was wrong.

The air was stiller than usual. Heavier. No sound. No hum of ventilation. No faint creak of aged wood. Only me, the old archival boxes, and a door unknown to me.

It had not been there before. Never.

A simple wooden door set into the wall between two shelves on the southern wall - where, in reality, there was only masonry. The door bore no sign. No window. Only a plain, dark brass handle. And the sensation that it noticed me.

I did not approach. I did not move. I could only stand, stare, and feel the strange, throbbing certainty that something crucial had begun. Something irreversible.

Then I awoke. That morning, with an unfamiliar energy, I prepared myself. I knew not what it was - hope? Resolve? Madness? Likely some dread amalgam of all three.

I left my apartment earlier than usual. The streets still damp with night mist; the light gray and sluggish.

I was first to arrive at the library - as planned. Without looking back, without switching on the lights, I went straight down to the archive.

The key trembled in my hand as I inserted it into the lock. The door opened slowly, with a creak that echoed like a deep and weary sigh from some ancient and forgotten abyss.

I stepped inside. And then I halted abruptly. My gaze fixed upon the wall where, in my dreams, the door had stood. I felt like a child on a Christmas morning, rushing eagerly beneath the boughs - only to find nothing but emptiness. No gifts. No wonders.

Cautiously, I approached the wall, extending my hand to rest upon the cold, unyielding rock. It was hard, rough, frigid - so palpably real that it seemed a cruel mockery. I knocked, but only a muffled sound replied. No hollow echo. No secret recess. My fingers traced every fissure, my eyes sought out a seam, a mark, some sign of what might lie beyond. I pressed my palms close against the wall in the absurd hope of feeling even a breath of air - some subtle signal that behind this stony facade something hid.

But there was nothing. Nothing at all. Only ancient stone, the relentless and mocking reality itself. Yet I knew, I felt it - this archive was real. Somewhere here, behind this unyielding barrier. And I must find it.

The following days passed with a deceptive monotony. Outwardly, all was calm. The library functioned; the world spun onward; and I performed my tasks as though nothing was amiss - smiling occasionally, even.

Mrs. Brandt and the other attendants seemed content. Perhaps even relieved - as if I had finally been restored to normalcy.

But they knew nothing.

Whenever the chance presented itself, I slipped away to the archive. Sometimes for mere minutes; other times, for longer.

I stared at the wall. I touched it. I listened. But nothing changed. No door. No sound. No sign. I felt ridiculous - like a child chasing after a secret that never existed.

But I could not stop. Night after night, I was the last to leave the library.

I waited endlessly in the archive, searching, scouring shelf by shelf, carpet by carpet. I hoped for a creak, a flicker in the corner of my eye, a whisper in the silence. But there was nothing. Always nothing.

And yet, each night I dreamed. I found myself within the archive - our archive - again and again. And there, always, was the door in the wall. An invitation, or a summons.

I told no one of this. Not because I trusted no one - but because I knew how it would sound. And I did not wish to hear the pleas to abandon this folly.

The others seemed unaware of my obsession. They noticed not my frequent absences to the archive. And if they did, they said nothing.

This quest consumed me. The door was all I could think of. Until one evening, when I found it.

The library was empty; shadows stretched long upon the wooden floor. I stood cloaked before the door, ready to lock up.

Then I heard it. A sound - from the return box.

Frozen, I stood. For a moment, I believed my heart had ceased its beating. A wave of overpowering déjà-vu seized me.

But this was no mere echo of the sound that once marked the book’s arrival. This was not the dull thud of leather on metall - but a metallic clang, sharp and resonant.

I approached the box, hesitated, then slowly lifted its flap. Inside lay a key. Old, rusted, weighty. I knew at once to which door it belonged.

I do not know how long I stood there, staring at that key - minutes, or perhaps but a breath. Time itself seemed suspended - stretched thin like glass about to shatter.

Then I moved. My fingers closed about the key, without conscious will. Heavier than expected, and cold - colder than metal should be. Its surface rough and jagged, as if someone had tried to carve inscrutable runes with claws, then abandoned the task.

I closed the box with trembling hands and turned. I had to enter the archive. Now. I walked - not hurriedly, but with unyielding purpose.

The lights were already extinguished; moonlight filtering through the windows was the sole guide upon my path.

Step by step I descended the spiral stairs into the archive. My hand clutched the key as if afraid to relinquish it even for a moment.

I reached the archive door. I pushed it open and stepped inside.

And there it was. The wall.

The very same wall I had stared at countless times in recent days. Only now - it was no longer the same.

Where once stood bare stone, now there was a door. So natural, so silent, as though it had never been absent - an intrinsic part of the room itself. Plain, narrow, fashioned of dark, ancient wood.

I drew closer, slow, almost reverent. My heart pounded so fiercely it seemed to fill the chamber. A part of me expected it to vanish should I blink, a mere figment of madness’s last gasp.

But it remained.

I raised the key. It fit. It slid not smoothly, but with resistance, as though I must first push aside the weight of centuries and time itself. Then - a click. Not a mechanical sound, but a tone - deep and resonant, as if from a realm behind the wall, from a world beyond this world.

I felt the ancient tumblers vibrate beneath my fingertips - an almost organic crackling within the metal, as though the door itself were waking from a long slumber.

Slowly, I pushed it open. The creak was unnaturally loud - too loud. It vibrated through the floor, the shelves, my very bones. As if not merely an old lock, but an entire cosmos had been unsealed.

And then I saw it. Endless corridors. Row upon row of bookshelfes, towering so high they vanished into the darkness above - as if leading beyond space and time.

And within them - black books. Thousands. Millions. Countless. Each identical.

Without hesitation, I crossed the threshold. The instant my foot touched the floor beyond, I knew I had left our world behind. Entered something beyond place or time.

The air smelled different here. Old. Dusty. Heavy. Yet tinged with an electric charge - like a storm that had brewed for centuries without release.

Behind me, the door shut with a soft thud - like a heartbeat muffled in shadow.

I whirled about. But no door remained. No entrance. Only more corridors. More shelves. Black books, stretching to the horizon.

I was alone. And I knew: whatever this archive was - it had not merely admitted me. It had awaited me.

I began to walk. Slowly. Step by step, accompanied by the whispering I knew so well - that faint, bodiless susurrus, dwelling between the pages, insinuating itself into the crevices of my mind.

The unseen eyes rested once more upon me, heavy as shadows from another world. I felt them upon my neck, between my shoulder blades, in the deepest recesses of my thoughts.

I do not know how long I wandered.

When I glanced at my watch shortly after entering, I saw it had stopped - its hands frozen at 21:47. Perhaps the moment I crossed the threshold. As if time outside had relinquished its hold on me.

After some time, a thought emerged. One I had never dared entertain in my dreams. Something had always held me back there - an invisible law, a prohibition my mind instinctively accepted. But now… all was different. I was awake. And I had to know. What did the other books contain?

I approached one of the countless shelves, withdrew a volume at random - any would do. The cover was black and smooth, cold to the touch, almost metallic, heavy in my hands. Just as Sarah’s book had felt, shortly before it ended.

I opened it. The script was ancient; the pages yellowed. Yet I read the words effortlessly - as though they had been written for me alone.

It was the story of a man named John, from the 19th century. He lived in a small English village - a simple life marked by duty, loss, and fleeting moments of happiness. I read of his family, his craft as a carpenter, his dreams, his doubts.

Then came the moment I knew well. He began to feel watched. At first, a flicker at the edge of vision. Then a shadow in the mirror. The feeling of never being alone. His mind unraveled. He could not sleep; he spoke of voices whispering through the cracks in his walls. He suffered the same nightmares Sarah had.

No one believed him. He was broken - bit by bit - by a presence that hollowed his soul.

I turned to the final page. I knew what it would say. John had taken his own life. A revolver pressed to his mouth, the trigger pulled - his last thoughts consumed by the archive.

And the final words on the page read, as in Sarah’s book:
*“The Archivist Below sees.”*

I closed the book slowly, breathing heavily. My fingers tingled numb. Something within me was shaken - but not surprised.

I reached for the next book. And the next. And the next.

A woman from 11th-century Japan. A monk from Byzantium. A young sailor aboard a Dutch vessel crossing the Atlantic. A child in a village north of Novosibirsk. A clockmaker in Prague. A cartographer in Alexandria. Different centuries. Different tongues. Different lives. And yet - they were all the same.

First they lived. Then they heard the whispering. Then the eyes. Then the decay. Then death.

And always, always, at the end:
*“The Archivist Below sees.”*

With each book, a coldness grew - not outward, but deep within me. It was as though I perceived a pattern, never meant for mortal eyes - a web of fates spun through the centuries - all converging here. In this place. This archive.

I know not how many volumes I read - ten? A hundred? Perhaps I spent an eternity beneath that whispering canopy that never ceased.

Some books remained blank, and I knew they were waiting for a life to cling to them - like a predator awaiting prey.

My knees ached from standing, my back from bending, my mind from endless recognition. I could feel them - those lives trapped in those pages - clinging to me like fine dust on ancient furniture, neglected for too long. The air was heavy, yet something compelled me onward.

I lost all sense of place - front and back dissolved. The corridors became a labyrinth of darkness, defying all orientation. It was as if the space itself shifted with each step.

Then - after what felt like weeks, or perhaps mere hours - something changed. Before me opened a sort of clearing. Not a true hall, but a void amid the endless shelves, as though some space had been left deliberately amid chaos.

A hollow circle. At its center: an altar. Formed from dark, near-black stone, rough and irregular, as though not carved but broken from a single massive block. Its surface was etched with runes unlike any human script - seeming to move and breathe in the endless darkness’s faint light. Upon the altar rested a thick black Book.

A cold shiver ran down my spine as I stepped closer. The altar was ancient. Not merely old as some temple relic - but old as time itself.

I laid my hand upon the stone, letting my fingers trace its surface. It felt warm - not as though it retained heat, but as if it were alive.

The whispering grew louder. Now it was not many voices - but one. A single, deep, rasping voice, unspoken yet palpable. I understood not its words, yet knew it understood me.

Suddenly, I thought I heard my name. Not spoken aloud - but willed into my mind: Clara.

I jerked my hand back. The stone vibrated faintly - not visibly, not measurably - but tangibly. Like a heartbeat. Slow. Heavy. Inhuman.

I scrutinized the book upon the altar. It resembled all the others save one detail. Upon its front cover were the same runes that adorned the altar’s surface - a script not of this world, impossible to describe.

I took the book in hand - and the instant my fingers touched its leather, a chill shot through me - not from without - it was as if something crept beneath my skin - not painful, but alien - a pulsating, creeping presence ascending my forearm.

My heart quickened - not from fear, but anticipation. A forgotten reflex now awakened. I felt as if something recognized me. Something dwelling in the book - perhaps the book itself. It was heavier than the others.

The whispering ceased abruptly - as if the entire library held its breath.

I replaced the book on the altar and opened it. The yellowed pages bore the same runes as the altar stone. I turned them slowly, understanding no word, no letter - yet, in an eerie way, comprehending that it told the story of a life.

But not a human life. Something else. Something old. Very old. Perhaps the story of our universe itself. Or something older still - lying beneath all comprehension.

With trembling fingers, I reached the last page. I saw the final lines - and then - a pain exploded within my skull - so immense that I cried out aloud. It felt as if something clawed at my very soul, fracturing my consciousness.

I dropped the book. The whisper returned - but now it became screams. A chorus of countless souls - voices crying, wailing, pleading, shrieking. The very sound of the depths of hell itself.

I fell back, staggering - then darkness took me. I came to - but not in the library, not in the archive.

I was... elsewhere. Surrounded by endless blackness. Not merely darkness in a room, but a darkness that devoured space itself.

I could not see my body - only feel it. Yet that felt alien as well.

And I was not alone. Never before had I felt so utterly seen - not watched, but pierced, dissected, *read*. 

Something was here with me. Something older than time. Something that knew me before I was born.

I tried to scream - but no sound left my lips. For in this place, this nothingness, sound itself did not exist. Only pure, emptiness.

Then I saw it. Before me, in the void, two eyes opened. 

They were immense beyond measure, beyond all scales of this world. So black, so deep, so infinitely cold, that even the loneliest reaches of the cosmos seemed warm by comparison. These eyes held not merely darkness - they were darkness. Ancient, absolute, sentient darkness.
And I knew: I stood face to face with the entity that left its mark in all those books, all those lives.

The being that knew Sarah. The being that knew John. The being that knew millions - before it broke them.

I stood before the creature calling itself *The Archivist Below.* And it gazed into me - deep into me. Not into my body, nor my thoughts - but into the primal origin of all I am.

Then the pain returned. An all-consuming, blazing fire within my skull. Sharper, more brutal than before. I wanted to scream, to flee, to die - 
but it would not allow me.

My body obeyed no longer, my senses failed. All became light, then darkness, then silence.

I opened my eyes. I lay upon the cold floor of the archive. The ordinary archive. The familiar faint scent of old pages and dust filled the air. No altar. No whisper. No book. No door. The wall before me was once more a mere wall - bare stone, unmoved, mute.

I rose slowly, heart racing, limbs trembling. I felt as if I had left a part of myself down there - there with *it*.

But I was back. Back in the world.

I do not know how I came home. I remember not the path, not leaving the library, not closing the door behind me. Only that I was one moment in my bed. 

And that night, I dreamed again. But not of the archive. Not of corridors, nor books.

I lay upon the floor - there, in that darkness where no direction, no sound, no up or down existed. Only me - and the weeping. And then the feeling returned. That presence. Those cold eyes, watching me, piercing me. As Sarah felt it, when I was the one who watched her.

From that day, all changed. The whisper never ceased. It haunted me not only in my dreams. It haunted my bedroom, the streets, my mind. A faint susurrus - like a thousand tongues murmuring ancient truths, words I did not understand, yet my mind pretended to know.

I never felt alone again. Not brushing my teeth. Not in the bath. Not beneath the covers. Never again. Each movement, each thought, became a parade beneath alien gaze - like a mouse trapped in a glass cage.

Eventually, I stopped going to work. I did not resign. I said nothing. One day I simply awoke and knew I would never return. That I was *forbidden* to.

Then I stopped eating. Not from revulsion, but because food had become... meaningless. Like everything else.

Each night, I dreamed the same dream. That I lay upon the floor of darkness, crying - and that it saw me. Not from afar. Not behind glass. But from everywhere.

And each day I felt emptier. More lost.

Until I understood there was no escape. I know now that I am but one of countless victims of this entity.

That my book now stands in that archive. That every step I take is written there. Word for word.

I know my time has come. I must bring this ordeal to its final end. To persist in this state is impossible - not with the ceaseless whispering, not with those ever-watchful eyes, not with the relentless sensation of being observed from realms beyond mortal ken.

Now I understand why so many before me chose the same grim escape - the only refuge that remains to me as well.

I sought answers, a glimmer of understanding about the nature of the Archive, about what lurks beneath its inscrutable surface. But now I know that no answer exists. That this Archive, this world, this unfathomable entity - lies beyond the bounds of all human reason and comprehension.

Only one truth remains: *The Archivist Below* has marked me.

And someday - perhaps - he shall mark you too.

1mivc5x,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1mivc5x/launched_inkwell_a_microjournaling_app_that/,Launched Inkwell - A micro-journaling app that actually respects your privacy,"I've been trying to get into journaling for years but every app I downloaded felt... wrong.

**My specific frustrations:**

* Apps like Day One wanted me to write these long, reflective entries every single day. Sometimes I just want to jot down a quick thought during lunch, you know?
* Most store your private thoughts on their servers. Why would I want some company reading my journal entries for ""AI insights""?
* The streak pressure was killing me. Miss one day and you're back to zero. Made journaling feel like a chore instead of something helpful.
* So many unnecessary features - mood tracking, photo collages, sharing options. I just wanted to write stuff down.

**What I actually wanted:**

* Multiple short entries throughout the day when inspiration hits
* My data staying on MY devices (iCloud sync, but it's still mine)
* No guilt if I skip days or want to add something I thought of yesterday
* Just... simple text entry. That's it.

Couldn't find anything that matched this, so I spent a couple of weeks building Inkwell.

Now I actually journal regularly because it doesn't fight me. Sometimes it's just ""good coffee this morning,"" other times it's deeper stuff. No pressure either way.

If anyone wants to try it out, I'd genuinely appreciate the feedback—especially if you've had similar frustrations with other journaling apps. Still learning what works for different people.

It still had that classic Ethiopian character but with more intensity and complexity, but with a classic coffee type finish that I’ve found I really enjoy about Ethiopian coffees.

  BLYTHE  
  
  I was as ugly inside as I was outside. It was the only explanation for the fact I hadn’t been able to cry one single tear. I hadn’t even squeezed out one fake tear at Mrs. Williams’s funeral. I knew the church people thought I was evil. I could see it when they looked at me. But they had all gotten to witness it firsthand when they’d watched me not show one small streak of emotion when I’d stood beside Pastor Williams as they’d lowered his wife into the ground. She had been diagnosed with a brain tumor only five months ago. It had been stage five, and there had been nothing they could have done.  
  
  The congregation had stopped by to check on her daily, and the parsonage had been flooded with casseroles, pies, and flowers. I ha  
d been told to stay out of sight. I’d only upset her. Pastor Williams had been kind when he’d instructed me to keep to my room when I’d come home from school, but it’d still stung. I’d waited until I was sure they were asleep most nights to sneak downstairs and fix me something to eat for dinner. The endless supply of food had made it easy.  
  
  When she had finally taken her last breath, the hospice nurse had come and knocked on my door to inform me. I had been asked to call Pastor Williams at the church and have him come home. I hadn’t felt anything. Not one emotion from the news. I’d realized then that she had been right all those years. I was evil. Only someone truly evil could be so indifferent to death. Mrs. Williams had been only fifty-four. But then, that was much older than my mother had been when she’d died—she had been only twenty.  
  
  That was all behind me now. That life was over and in my past.  
  
  I stood outside the apartment building that overlooked the Alabama gulf coast and let it sink in that this was now my home. I was far away from the life I’d lived in South Carolina. I would have a new life here. One where I could sit and write my stories and attend the community college.  
  
  Pastor Williams had wanted to get rid of me. I was thankful for that because I needed a way to get free from that place. He had called a friend of his and had gotten me into a community college ten hours away from the town full of people who hated me. He had bought me an apartment on the beach and even managed to get me a job working as a church secretary. He had a friend who pastored a church in Sea Breeze, Alabama. It was one of the reasons he had sent me here. He had had someone help set me up while he remained in South Carolina.  
  
  I had heard Pastor Williams on the phone explaining to the man who would be my boss that I wasn’t good with people and I was sheltered. Which wasn’t exactly true. I had gone to an all-girl Christian academy, and everyone there had pretended that I hadn’t existed. It wasn’t my fault their mommas had told them about the evil inside me. I had never had a chance to actually be around people who wanted anything to do with me.  
  
  Before I took my boxes out of the truck, I wanted to check out the apartment. Pastor Williams had given me a truck, too. Grabbing my purse and the keys he had placed in an envelope, along with one thousand dollars in cash, I jumped down out of the old truck and headed for the stairs. None of the apartments were on the street level. They were all on stilts above the ground. I figured this was for times when the water got high . . . or during hurricanes. I wasn’t going to think about hurricanes. Not now.  
  
  I slipped the key into the lock and turned before pushing the door open. It swung wide, and I took in the pretty pale yellow walls and white wicker furniture. It was all very coastal. I loved it.  
  
  Smiling, I walked inside and spun around in a circle with my arms opened wide. I tilted my head back and closed my eyes and let myself bask in the solitude. No one knew me here. I wasn’t the evil girl who the pastor was stuck taking care of. I was just me. Blythe Blakely. And I was a writer. A recluse eccentric writer who didn’t care what she looked like. It didn’t matter. She was free.  
  
  Loud male voices laughing and throwing insults in the hallway interrupted my quiet moment of joy. I dropped my arms to turn and lock gazes with . . . with . . . a guy. Blue. Like the sky on a clear sunny day. That was all I could focus on. I had never seen eyes so blue. They were so startling, they were almost breathtaking. His friends’ voices were fading away, but he was still standing there. Then I noticed it. . . . Was he wearing black eyeliner? I dropped my eyes to take in the rest of him.  
  
  The pierced eyebrow and colorful tattooed skin I saw covering his arms had me jerking my gaze back up to his face. Seemingly windblown platinum-blond hair finished the wild look.  
  
  “You done, love? Or is it my turn?” The teasing lilt to his low husky voice reminded me of warm chocolate. It made me feel almost giddy.  
  
  Not sure what he was talking about, I looked back at his amused eyes. “I, uh . . .” I what? I didn’t know what to say. “I don’t know what you mean,” I finally told him honestly. Should I apologize for staring at him? Had I been?  
  
  “Are you done checking me out? Because I’d hate to interrupt you.”  
  
  Oh. My face heated, and I knew my cheeks were bright red. What was I thinking, leaving my door open for the world to see me? I wasn’t used to this. Keeping my distance from men in general made me extremely inept at talking to one. However, this one didn’t stare at me with that leer that made me nervous. I was used to the look men gave me because they thought I would do bad things with them. The ugly they saw didn’t seem to deter them from wanting to see if I was as evil as they had heard.  
  
  “It’s just some tattoos and a couple piercings, love. I promise I’m harmless,” he said this time with a smile on his face.  
  
  I managed to nod. I should say something. I just wasn’t sure what to say. He was waiting on me to speak. “I like them,” I blurted out nervously. That sounded stupid. He raised an eyebrow, and a smirk touched his lips. “The tattoos—they’re nice. Colorful. Uh . . . I . . .” I sounded like an idiot. There was no saving myself from this disaster. Closing my eyes so I didn’t have to see those blue eyes watching me, I took a deep breath. “I’m not good at talking to people—guys, people, anyone really.” Had I really just told him that?  
  
  If he would just turn and leave, then we could forget this moment forever. I forced my eyes open and caught him studying me with that grin still on his lips. He was going to think I was nuts. Maybe he was visiting someone here and didn’t live in this complex. I really didn’t want to face him again. Ever.  
  
  He pressed the pad of his thumb to his bottom lip and bit the tip of it before chuckling and shaking his head. “Not sure I’ve met anyone quite like you,” he said before letting his hand fall back down to his side.  
  
  I was positive he hadn’t.  
  
  “Krit, dude.” a male voice called down loudly from what sounded like the second floor. “We got, like, thirty minutes until we gotta be there. Go fucking shower and change.”  
  
  “Shit,” he muttered, glancing down at his phone as he pulled it out of his pocket. “Gotta go. But I’ll see you around, little dancer,” he said with a wink, then stepped back out of the doorway and walked down the hall.  
  
  Little dancer? Oh. I covered my face with both hands. He had seen me spinning around like an idiot. I sure hoped I didn’t see him again. I just wanted to live life without drawing attention to myself. I was leaving that life—the one where people saw me and huddled together while laughing and glancing at me—behind. I didn’t want to give anyone here ammunition to make fun of me. Being invisible couldn’t be that hard.  
  
  Unless you try to talk to guys, genius, I thought to myself. Walking over to the door, I closed and locked it. Next time I wanted to do something like spin in circles, I needed to close my door first.  
  
  KRIT  
  
  Tonight we had a gig at Live Bay. It was a club in town that drew both tourists and locals. We had become a crowd favorite over the past two years, so the three nights a week we played at the club equaled four hundred and fifty dollars for each of us. Live Bay, along with the bar we played at an hour away in Florida, and another club in Mobile, Alabama, both weekly gigs, allowed each of us to clear over a grand a week just performing.  
  
  Green, my best friend and bass guitar in our band, Jackdown, and I shared an apartment. However, we always had people crashing there. We were a family. We had been since we started this thing. Other than my older sister, Trisha, I hadn’t had family, really. Our home life had sucked growing up. Now Trisha had her husband, Rock, and the three kids they’d adopted. She managed to make it most Thursday nights to listen to me play, but that was it now. Used to be that she wouldn’t miss even one of my shows.  
  
  I got it though. I was good with it. She finally had the family she’d always wanted, and she was happy. That was enough. She was a damn good mom, and those kids were lucky she was theirs now.  
  
  We had a good show even though Trish wasn’t there. But the redhead I’d decided to bring home th  
at night was tugging on my arm, needing attention. I hadn’t had enough to drink, and I was lost in my thoughts instead of focusing on her tits, she so wanted me to notice her. I’d noticed already. It was one of the reasons she was going back to my place.  
  
  “You’re ignoring me,” the girl pouted, sticking out her lips, where were painted a deep red. I liked red lips. Another reason she was with me.  
  
  “Easy there. He has an easy trigger after a gig,” Green called back to us from the driver’s seat. He knew how annoyed I could get with clingy needy girls. I just wanted them willing and easy.  
  
  “I’m just making sure he hasn’t changed his mind,” the girl replied.  
  
  “When I change my mind, love, you’ll know it,” I told her, then leaned down to take a taste of her red lips. They had the flavor of the candy she had been sucking on earlier, and beer. It was a good taste. I wanted a little more.  
  
  Green chuckled from the front seat as the car came to a stop. “See, he’s all fun and games if you just let him be,” he said.  
  
  I broke the kiss and got out of the car. I was ready for a drink and some music. And a lot of people. I needed the crowd. “They all coming?” I asked Green as I held out my hand for the girl to take. She quickly scrambled out of the car and clung to me.  
  
  “Probably already here,” he replied. The band liked crashing at our place on nights we played at Live Bay. We kept an open door for any neighbors. Seeing as they were all college students, they never complained. They came and joined the party.  
  
  “What’s your name?” I asked the girl on my arm.  
  
  I glanced down at her to see the pinched frown on her lips. She’d told me earlier, but I hadn’t cared then. I hadn’t been sure I’d be spending the night with her yet. Now I wanted to know. I didn’t fuck a girl if I didn’t know her name.  
  
  “Jasmine,” she replied, then flipped her red hair over her shoulder.  
  
  Jasmine seemed to have a bit of a temper with that red hair of hers. Normally, I was amused but not tonight. I was moody.  
  
  The music was already going when we started up the stairs. There was no doubt it was coming from our apartment. Matty, our drummer, always grabbed a girl or three quickly and left the club after we finished our gig. But most of the time he got to the apartment first if his females didn’t slow him down.  
  
  “Looks like the party has already started. I’m gonna step out early and go find somewhere to study,” Green said as he slowed to walk beside me.  
 Green was almost done with law school. He would be taking the bar exam in six months. I was proud of him, but I also knew things would be changing soon. He wasn’t going to be able to pursue law and live like we were living. He rarely stayed for the parties. He always escaped to go study. Eventually I would lose him, but I wanted him to succeed.  
  
  “We should move the parties to Matty’s from now on,” I said, feeling guilty that Green had to leave his place to be able to study.  
  
  Green shook his head. “Hell, no. The dipshit doesn’t ever clean up, and his apartment is tiny as fuck. Besides, let’s not mess with a good thing. I’ve made it this far doing it this way. It works.”  
  
  Since we’d been kids, Green had been the smart one. The one who always sacrificed. He made things happen. But somehow I had always been the one in the spotlight. Didn’t really seem fair.  
  
  “Just say the word when you want to change that,” I told him, then glanced over at the closed apartment door we were passing.  
  
  A smile tugged on the corner of my lips. Damn, that girl had been adorable twirling around her apartment. I had never seen such long thick hair that was so dark, it was almost black. Then those eyes of hers had been fucking amazing. I wasn’t even sure what color they were exactly. They looked like they were hazel, but they reminded me of jewels. They’d been startling at first.  
  
  Although she had been wearing baggy-ass sweats and an even larger T-shirt, I could see the curves underneath. Sucked that I was only going to have to imagine what they actually looked like because I wasn’t touching that. The innocence pouring off that girl was thick. She had barely been able to form words to talk to me.  
  
  Fucking adorable was what it had been. And I didn’t do adorable. Ever.  
  
  Jasmine’s hand slid down over my jeans and cupped my balls. “I like to suck,” she whispered in my ear.  
  
  “Good. You can show me how much as soon as we get in the room,” I told her, and reached around to cup her ass.  
  
  That had been all the reassurance she needed apparently, because she started unbuttoning my jeans before we reached the door to my apartment. Green turned back to say something to me and saw her hand busy at work with my jeans. He laughed and rolled his eyes then walked into our apartment, which was already full of several of the guys who lived around us, and a few locals who we partied with regularly. Of course, there were plenty of girls. Just in case Jasmine didn’t work out.  
  
  Chapter Two  
  
  BLYTHE  
  
  The sun broke through the blinds on the windows, waking me up much sooner than I’d wanted to. I reached for my pillow and covered my face with a groan. It had been sometime after three before the noise upstairs had ended and I had been able to fall asleep. I kept waiting for the cops to show up and shut the party down. Surely there had been other people in this complex who had been trying to sleep.  
  
  But the cops never came. The music continued blaring, and the banging on my ceiling had only gotten worse. I hoped they enjoyed themselves, celebrating whatever it was they were celebrating, but I hoped they never did it again. I still had a week before my classes started. Which meant I had a week to get the things I needed and get settled in my apartment.  
  
  Even exhaustion couldn’t keep the smile from creeping across my face. Wearing panties and a tank top, I was about to get up and go fix myself breakfast. Then I was going to sit and eat it in on the sofa and not worry about anyone making me feel unwelcomed. I was free. I was finally alone, and there was no one to disapprove of me.  
  
  Kicking off my covers, I got out of bed and looked down. Normally, the first thing I did when I got up was make the bed or suffer punishment. Now I wasn’t sure if I would ever make my bed again. With a spring in my step I headed for the kitchen to make coffee and toast a bagel.  
  
  Then I would make a list of things I needed for school and my apartment. Although it had come with furniture that Pastor Williams had said was part of the monthly payment, it didn’t have things like curtains or a can opener. The shower curtain was also a plain white. I wanted to add some color, and because I wasn’t supposed to paint the walls, I had to add color elsewhere. Maybe I could find some pillows for the sofa and some pictures for the walls. I didn’t have an unlimited budget, so I needed to be careful.  
  
  I also didn’t start my job for another week, and then it would be another week before I received my first check. Some things would have to wait until later. But I could get started today.  
  
  Clothes. I needed a few outfits that weren’t oversize hand-me-downs or had come from the thrift store. I really needed to buy a few basic things to get me through the next few months of school and work. I couldn’t go to work in what I owned right now. I knew that clothes wouldn’t change the way I looked, but they would at least help me appear more presentable. I decided to keep the pillows that came with the sofa. And the pictures for the walls could wait.  
  
  \* \* \*  
  
  It took me a little over an hour to find two pairs of shorts and a denim skirt that all hit above my knees. I had never worn anything that showed off my legs before. It was both terrifying and exhilarating. Even better than leaving my bed unmade. Then I had bought one pair of jeans that actually fit me. Almost too well. Once I had bottoms, I went to look for tops. I had bought four blouses and two tank tops. Finally I picked out a pair of tennis shoes that would work best for work and school. They were all I really needed, but the pretty pink high heels kept drawing my attention. I had never had shoes with heels, or shoes that could be considered pretty, for that matter. These weren’t very dressy and could be worn with the skirt and two of my blouses. I could even wear them with the shorts. I had seen girls do that before.  
  
  I tried several times to walk away from them, but in the end I picked up the box with my size and walked to the register to pay for them before I could change my mind again. I was going to live differently here. These heels were a symbol of that new life.  
  
  Carrying all the shopping bags up to my apartment wasn’t exactly fun. I was on the first floor, but I was also on the beach. So I had to walk up a flight of stairs just to get to the first floor. The people above me had even farther to walk. There were no elevators here since it was just the two floors. It took me five trips up and down to get everything into my apartment. But then my energy was renewed with the thrill of getting to put things in their places.  
  
  When I turned to close my apartment door my eyes locked with the electric blue ones I’d seen yesterday. That guy was standing there again, leaning against the door casing with his arms crossed over his chest and a smirk on his face.  
  
  “Looks like someone went shopping bright and early this morning,” he said with that husky voice of his that made my body do funny things.  
  
  I nodded, afraid of the stupidity that would come out of my mouth if I tried to talk to him again. I suddenly wished I had put on one of my new outfits and worn it home. Which was silly. I shouldn’t care what I looked like for this guy.  
  
  “My band plays at Live Bay on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights. You should stop in one night and see us. I’ll even buy you a drink during my break,” he said with that amused grin still on his lips.  
  
  Was he teasing me?  
  
  I had to respond this time. Nodding again would be rude. “Okay. I’ll do that one night . . . maybe,” I replied. I wasn’t sure if I would ever go to Live Bay—wherever that was—but telling him no seemed impossible.  
  
  “I’ll look for you then.” He straightened up from his relaxed stance. “I never got your name.”  
  
  My name. He wanted to know my name. I could answer that easily enough. “Blythe?” I replied, wishing it hadn’t sounded like I was asking him instead of telling him.  
  
  He winked. “Fits you,” he replied, then sauntered off without another word. He hadn’t told me his name, but I remembered it from yesterday when his friend had called for him. Krit. It was an unusual name. I wondered what it was short for. Walking over to my door, I closed it and forced all thoughts of how sexy Krit’s eyes had looked without black eyeliner far from my min

  “I need something more than shitty beer,” Legend, our keyboard player, grumbled, sinking down into an overstuffed chair that belonged to Green.  
  
  I leaned forward and kissed the ear of the girl who was in my lap, and I relaxed on the couch. “Why don’t you go fix Legend some whiskey on the rocks, love.” It wasn’t a question, and she knew it. Britt was one of the girls I saw off and on. I didn’t see most girls more than once, but there were a few who were good with no attachments. The fact that Britt was nice and flexible, she was one who I got in the mood for every few weeks or so. Sometimes we saw each other more regularly. Just depended on how things were going in life.  
  
  Legend was busy watching television that couldn’t be heard over the music and voices. There were over thirty people in my apartment. Several were watching the football game on my flat-screen. It was an early night for us. I hadn’t planned on a party tonight, but the guys had shown up, and Green had been free of studying for once. So it happened.  
  
  Britt sashayed over to Legend and bent over while she handed him his drink to make sure I got a good view of her ass. It was barely covered up with the skirt she was wearing. Chuckling at her attempts, I took a drink of my beer and lifted my eyes to see Green standing and talking to someone at our open door.  
  
  Normally, people just came on in, but whoever it was wasn’t coming in. They were just talking to Green. He waved his hand and stepped back in invitation. It was Blythe. Her eyes scanned the room of people nervously, but she didn’t step inside. She also didn’t seem to notice me. Then Green reached out and took her hand and pulled her into the room.  
  
  I only noticed Green’s stupid grin before my eyes snapped back to Blythe. Holy shit, she wasn’t in baggy clothes tonight. Those curves I had thought I had seen hiding beneath those awful clothes were right there for the world to see. A pair of black shorts that showcased legs from fucking heaven was only outdone by the tank top that covered an impressive set of tits. Then put that all together with the glasses perched on her cute little nose. She hadn’t had those on before, but damn, they were sexy.  
  
  I realized Green was walking her over to me. Britt slipped her arm around me, plopped herself back in my lap, and began nibbling on my neck.  
  
  “Uh, dude, can you break free long enough to come here a sec?” Green asked, sounding uncomfortable. Blythe’s eyes grew wide as she watched Britt. Fuck, that innocence was there, shining like a warning sign. As if I needed it. I knew the girl wasn’t my speed. But damn, she was tempting. I wanted to reach up and undo that messy bun she had her hair pulled up in.  
  
  I moved Brit off of my lap and stood up. Blythe’s eyes went from Britt to me, and then she dropped her gaze to study the floor. I noticed Green’s hand resting on her arm as if he was there to jerk her from harm’s way if needed. I didn’t like that. I wasn’t sure why, but I didn’t. She was letting him keep his hand on her too.  
  
  “Did you decide to come join the party, love?” I asked, keeping my grin in place so I didn’t scare her with the snarl I was tempted to give Green. He was a horny bastard. Blythe wasn’t his speed either.  
  
  “No, that’s not why she’s here. Can we take this outside where we don’t have to talk so loud?” Green asked me with a pointed stare. What was his deal?  
  
  Blythe looked back longingly at the door like getting out of there was all she wanted in the world.  
  
  “Sure,” I replied, and Blythe spun around and hurried for the door.  
  
  Green shrugged and turned to follow her.  
  
  I glanced back at Britt, who was watching us closely. I motioned to her that I would be right back, then headed toward the door.  
  
  Green was standing there asking Blythe her name, and Blythe gave him a shy smile that was more than I had ever gotten from her. What the hell? Green wasn’t the charmer. I was.  
  
  “What’s the problem?” I asked as I joined them in the hallway. The annoyed tone in my voice didn’t go unnoticed by Blythe. Her eyes widened, and she started wringing her hands in front of her nervously.  
  
  “Krit, this is our new neighbor, Blythe. She lives directly underneath us,” he said in a tone that was obviously trying to make up for mine.  
  
  “We’ve met,” I told him, swinging my gaze to hers.  
  
  Her cheeks turned bright pink. Why? I hadn’t said anything to embarrass her.  
  
  “Oh, okay. Well, we are being inconsiderate with our noise level. This is two nights in a row that we’ve partied, and Blythe isn’t getting much sleep.”  
  
  So she was here to complain. Interesting. No one had ever complained before. This apartment complex was known for parties. Had she not known that when she moved in here?  
  
  I studied her face as she bit down on her bottom lip and looked ready to bolt. She thought she was going to make me mad. I was pretty damn sure that a girl who looked like her was incapable of making me mad. She gave off the “I need protecting” vibe in a big way. Add that to the heart-stopping face of hers, and she had a winning package deal to get away with all shit, even from me.  
  
  I stepped closer to her, which forced Green to move back some. Reaching down, I pulled one of her hands she was gripping so tightly into mine and ran my finger along the inside of her palm.  
  
  “Why don’t you come inside me with just for a few minutes? Meet some of your neighbors, and then when you’re ready to go, I think I have something that will help with the noise,” I told her as I kept my gaze locked with hers.  
  
  “I, uh, I’m not good with crowds,” she said with an apologetic tone.  
  
  I tugged on her hand until she was almost pressed against me. “I won’t leave your side, and I’m fucking amazing with crowds,” I replied with a wink to let her know I was serious.  
  
  “Don’t make her—” Green started to argue, but I cut him off.  
  
  “Not your business. Back off,” I warned him before sliding my hand around Blythe’s waist and walking her to the door.  
  
  Chapter Three  
  
  BLYTHE  
  
  I didn’t want to do this. Why had I come up here? Because I was tired and frustrated with the noise. That’s why. I had spent hours writing, then, when I got ready for bed, the noise had started up again. Did these people not need sleep? I just wanted to ask them to be a little quieter. I hadn’t wanted to be forced into staying at the party. I just wanted to go to bed.  
  
  “I really don’t want to do this,” I told Krit, who had his hand on my back and was firmly guiding me inside.  
  
  “Why not? They won’t bite you. I promise, because I won’t fucking let them,” The amusement in his voice bothered me. I wasn’t kidding. I didn’t want to go into this party.  
  
  “Please. I’m sorry I came up here. I will figure out how to sleep through this. Just let me leave.” I was ready to beg now. Whatever I needed to do to get away from this place. I could feel people staring at me. I hated that feeling. I knew what they were thinking. What they saw. I had come up here with my glasses on because I’d needed to see the computer screen, and my hair was in a mess on top of my head. My heart began to race. I had to get out of there.  
  
  “Shit, love, you’re shaking.” Krit’s voice was no longer amused. He stopped walking, and slipped his finger under my chin to tilt my head back. The frown on his face as he studied mine was new. He normally looked constantly amused.  
  
  “Come with me,” he said quietly, and reached down to take my hand. Then he walked down a hallway toward a closed door.  
  
  My panic escalated. That was a bedroom. I wasn’t going into a bedroom with him. I had to get away. I tried to tug my hand loose from his hold, but he threaded his fingers through mine and tightened his grip. No one had ever held my hand before. I stared down at his hand in mine and lost my train of thought for a moment.  
  
  It was a warm feeling having someone’s palm pressed against yours. His fingers laced with mine made me feel like I wasn’t alone. Like I was connected to someone. Had I ever felt that before? I wasn’t sure.  
  
  A door swung open, and Krit pulled me inside before closing it behind me.  
  
   
“Don’t look so terrified. I’m not going to do anything you don’t want me to. Just wanted to get you away from the noise a minute so we could be alone and talk.”  
  
  “Talk?” I asked as his hand released mine. The cold lonely feeling was back. I clasped my hands in an attempt to hold the warmth there. I had liked that warmth.  
  
  “You confuse me. Most girls don’t confuse me. But you, little dancer, have me playing guessing games. Why is that?”  
  
  He called me little dancer again. I wasn’t a dancer. Not even close. But I liked that he had a special name for me. It made me feel like I belonged.  
  
  “I didn’t really get into a social scene growing up. Not very good at that. I don’t fit in.” I hated pointing that out to him. For some reason he didn’t seem to get that I didn’t fit in, and I hadn’t wanted to be the one to break the news to him.  
  
  Krit cocked an eyebrow. “You say that like it’s a bad thing. Most people want to stand out.”  
  
  Stand out? That wasn’t what I meant. I shook my head. “No, that’s not . . . I mean, I don’t . . . I’m not appealing to be around.” That probably made less sense. I wasn’t about to open up to this guy about what was wrong with me. If he didn’t see it, then good. I liked that.  
  
  Krit frowned and stared at me like I was insane. Great. Now he saw the real me. Whatever he had been missing, I had just pointed it out to him. Why hadn’t I kept my mouth shut?  
  
  “You really mean that,” he said in a low whisper as he continued to stare at me. “Who the fuck told you that?”  
  
  I shrugged and turned my gaze from his to study the bedroom we were in. I wasn’t going to answer his question. That was something no one needed to know.  
  
  The walls were a smoky gray color, and the ceiling was painted black. I wasn’t allowed to paint my walls, yet he had painted his. The large king-size bed in the middle of the room was a rumpled mess. An electric guitar sat in one corner, and in the other far corner was an acoustic guitar. I turned my focus to the posters on the walls. Two of them were of what I assumed were rock bands, and there were signatures on them. Then, of course, the other poster was of a naked blonde with really big—and hopefully fake—boobs, because they looked a lot like bowling balls. They couldn’t be real. The blonde was straddling a guitar, and the only thing keeping her private area covered were her hands gripping the guitar between her legs.  
  
  “I wonder if she ever wears panties,” I mumbled out loud before I  could stop myself.  
  
  Krit’s laughter startled me, and I turned to see two very distinct dimples on his face. He didn’t look like the kind of guy who would have dimples, but wow, they did things for me. “I like to believe she doesn’t,” he replied, once he was through laughing.  
  
  “Where are you from?” Krit asked.  
  
  “A small town in South Carolina. You wouldn’t have heard of it,” I replied, feeling the sick knot in my stomach forming, the one that always came with memories of my life there.

I'm Brazilian and I love your YouTube channel.

You REAAAAALLY should cover the tariff's war that Trump is trying to impose to Brazil for 4 reasons:
1. He hates that the ""Tropical Trump"" (Bolsonaro) is going to jail and he is threatening our Supreme Court Justices to let Bolsonaro free.

2. The Big Techs deregulation is one of the other reasons for this attack because our judicial syste has some laws to prevent damages from the digital Wild West. 

3. Brazil has rare earth elements too and probably the Bolsonaro and his son promised  let the USA explore for a really low amount of money an zero fucks given environmental issues.

4. Brazilians really love been mentioned by people from other countries and we have a INSANE online presence, so your numbers will grow so high as Musk everyday. ",1,1754454424.0,AdamMockler,0,1.0,False
1miv5h1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hijabis/comments/1miv5h1/are_parents_word_truly_the_final_word_im/,Are parent’s word truly the final word? I’m genuinely struggling with this so much right now and every lecture I watch is telling me the exact same thing. But I feel so empty inside,"Disclaimer: A lot of this won’t make sense if you haven’t read my other posts.

I feel like my mental health is at an all time low. It’s been years since the things that my parents have said to me have actually gotten to me and hurt me, but the weekend might’ve been the absolute worst weekend ever. My parents sat my sisters and I down this Saturday and absolutely chewed us out about how disrespectful we’ve been the last few weeks. They’ve apparently lost sleep and couldn’t believe how we just moved on with our lives after my mom packed her stuff and left 2 weeks ago. 

And then the discussion became about respecting your parents and how we have the crazy audacity to speak out against anything they tell us to do. And they acted like we were complete villains, like we were the spawns of shaytaan when all we said was that we didn’t appreciate them supporting the person that has literally made their lives a living hell the last decade and a half of their lives, molested their daughters and came at us and their disabled sons with a knife 2 months ago. 

Then they go, even though your brothers have done a variety of shameful acts (sleeping around, substances, drinking, stealing money from them, anyone, us, stealing their cars, etc) they have never yelled back or spoke back to them as parents. I spoke up and was like, was there any moment that has nothing to do with your molester son where I spoke out of turn to you? I’ve cooked, cleaned, went to school, went to Quran school, took care of the house and my disabled brothers while you both were gone abroad, all while working and in university, but the one time I rightfully put my foot down against an injustice that happened to me, it’s all water under a bridge and it doesn’t matter because it was ages ago? Never mind that he was actively molesting my youngest sister who was 12 at the time, in 2019.

They couldn’t care less because the next thing my dad says is that he wants us to drop our statement that we submitted to the police when he broke in 2 months ago. He said if we didn’t do this that he would kick us out. I told him if you genuinely believe us and don’t care for what he did, you would let him rot in prison for what he’s done. That we were kind enough to not tac on the other myriad of charges that he deserves to live with. He shouldn’t be around his own children unsupervised and you us to drop our statement against him? I told him there’s no way I’m going to do that.

My dad got so angry. Like it was ac
tally scary, I actually thought he would beat the living crap out of me. I ran away ofc, and went outside the back door and stood around in the backyard in my socks😭 I snuck back inside to hear his yelling and I heard my mom trying to placate him, but I was so pissed. Like wtah?? How is he gonna get mad when his stupid son got himself in this dumb mess?? Like genuinely? They just want someone to be mad at. And you know what hes gonna say? If his son was in front of him, only one of them would walk away alive. I’m like that’s great and all, I’m not asking you to murder him, why is it so hard for you to let him rot in prison?? Which is exactly what my sisters end up saying. 

He then goes the same way you’re my daughters and I want to protect you, he’s still my son? Chat, is this not a crazy take? Like genuinely, I’ve been mulling over this for the last few days and??? I can’t come up with anything to rationalize this thought process. It was then magrib time, I came back inside and ran to my room and started packing. My mom was like wth are you doing and I’m like clearly I was just kicked out? And she’s like put your crap down you idiot, you’re not going anywhere. And then she’s like this is for your own good. Yeah like how everything terrible that’s been done to me has been for my own good? You hitting me, shipping me off to Africa, leaving me here alone to take care of the house while your grown and useless sons had to do nothing while I was working and in school from 17 until 20 and I had no life and any time I tried to I was called a wh*re, in the worst depression, and praying to Allah to take my life in my sleep so I wouldn’t be punished for committing? Yeah, we’ve heard that before.

And then she’s going to bring up her other demon spawn, the second oldest that I have issues with, but he’s not a molester, just. grown man that beats on girls half his size and 9+ yrs younger than him. And she’s like you’ve never called the cops on him, and I’m like you guys never had this weird fixation on him like you do your freak oldest. Besides, you guys would still act like this if I did this. Mind you, my 24M has definitely called the police on both of them, it’s just a problem when we do it. Sometimes, I can’t help but feel like they just wanted us to die that night, I’d least I’d be dead knowing that he would locked up for life and there would be nothing my parents would be able to do about it. 

I then tell her, you would never let any of us get away with what any of your sons have done. Look at how you guys are yelling at us for calling the cops on a drunk loser that broke into your house. And then she’s like ofc we’d support you the same way we support them💀 Don’t make me laugh. Support?? You would’ve kicked us out at the first strike, like you guys are now, even though there is nothing more that can happen in this situation to victimize us more than we already are and YOURE STILL ON HID SIDE. How are you made that we’re disappointed that you’re laughing with our molester?? Genuinely, how? And I told her it’s quite obvious you favor all your sons than you ever did us. You’ve never liked us. You’ve only ever tolerated us. 

She walked away afterwards. I kept packing and snuck a shower in, if I didn’t end up getting kicked out. I didn’t, I kind of wish that happened. We sat down again, and then my dad brought up the story of Prophet Ibrahim AS and how when Allah told him to slaughter his son, Ismael AS, that Ismael AS told him father to do as Allah swt instructed. And I was like no way. But I guess I can see it from that point. Don’t retract your statement for your own personal feelings, but rather because your parents instructed you to do, in that sense. But I can’t like I still don’t want to. They were saying “if” the legal team ends up needing it, and ofc they’re paying for his defense😍 And in the same breath, my dad is going to yell at us for not helping to pay the bills… Mind you none of his sons have ever paid a single penny to him, forget the thousands of dollars they’ve put both of them into debt, at least $100k in the last decade, but sure your daughters getting 2 packages delivered in the same week and food every once in a while and paid for with the money they earned is the real issue here….


But I just told them sure. I apologized, I didn’t want to. And then my dad is going to co
plain about how we don’t want to apologize and how he can tell from our body language… And then my mom is going to chime in and say these girls genuinely believe that they’re not supported and that we’re the reason behind what happened decades ago, some random stuff that happened once or twice (she’s talking about her son molesting us btw), shouldn’t dictate everything🫩 Right. And she’s like ofc I like you guys more than the boys, we talk and have girl time together and I can’t do that with the boys. And I’m like, I genuinely resent myself for having any conversation I’ve had with you ever. You think we’re close because you can spill your feelings and troubles onto us, but whenever we do the same, we’re completely wrong about how we are feeling. We’ve told her several times we were molested, and each time she brushed it off in the last decade. And now every time we bring it up, she acts like she was none the wiser and that it was our fault for not detailing it for her. 

We eventually gave up and just pretended that we moved on, ofc we didn’t and they just insist on shoving that freak into every single crevice of their lives and forcing him in ours too. 

Im going to stop talking to them. My sisters and I have already determined that we are moving next winter. We’ll just become yes man until we do. I’m going to work on my independence, get my own line, my own car, save up, pay off whatever debts I have, etc. I can’t live like this. Funny enough, I told my mom this that night I was “kicked out”, that I didn’t know what they wanted from us and that it seemed like they just wanted to yell at somebody because they couldn’t do it properly to anyone else without getting results, and that I was sick of living here and dealing with this. And she just gave me the most disgusted look ever💀💀 

It was a wake up call, not that I needed one. But it’s just getting worse and worse. I cried all Sunday and Monday after they forced us to apologize. I was seething in rage until it just hit me like what did i ever do them for them to hate us like this. I’ve tried to be best daughter ever. We bought them expensive gifts we saved up to buy, bought them coffee, cooked for them, cared for them, helped out as much as we could, just for them to equate us saying not to retracting a police statement to the horrible and disgusting things their sons have been doing since the dawn of time. We’re even worse in their eyes. I didn’t look at their faces for days. And my mom wants to act normal, but I’m so short with her, I don’t even want to talk to her.

I’m trying to hold it together, but I just feel so miserable inside. I thought I got over this, and I already know how little they feel toward us, but the reminders hurt. Every week my dad wants a “meeting” just to yell at us. And he’ll call my younger siblings and 24M over just to make passive aggressive remarks about us  and I’m so sick of it. All I’ve been doing is crying these days and I hate crying so much. And I’m scared I’m going to go back into that debilitating depression and I can’t be stuck in a rut like that right now when I need to be moving forward more than ever. And I just don’t know what to do. 

I’ve been trying to listen to lectures, but every single one is telling me the same thing, that listening to our parents is key to being a good Muslim. And I already struggle so much with the deen and my imaan and I’m scared that this is pushing me away even more when I know I’m supposed to be turning to Allah right now and asking for His guidance. I just feel so gross around them all the time, I hate being at this house, I’m upping my hours at work, but even then they have snide remarks about that, and I’m just sick of it all.

1miv3iw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Psoriasis/comments/1miv3iw/what_helped_the_most_in_healing_guttate_psoriasis/,What helped the most in healing Guttate Psoriasis.,"**Purpose**

1. Share information about guttate psoriasis. 
2. Take feedback from people who try this protocol. 
3. Document the feedback and update the protocol to help others. 
4. Let's learn and heal together. 

**Cause of Guttate psoriasis**

Overgrowth of specific fungal strain. This fungus can also cause dandruff. This fungus naturally exists on humans. But under some circumstances it can over grow causing skin/scalp issues. 

**Dermatologist approach**

When we go to dermatologists, they talk about suppressing the immune system using drugs. 

**Why I don't agree with dermatologists**

Immune system should be strong as it is super important for the body. If immune system is not working well, then we should make it work well. We should not suppress it.

**Healing Approach**

Plenty of TLC for immune system. 

1. Avoid anything that hurts immune system.

2. Give all input needed for immune system to work well.

**What to avoid?**

1. Sugar, corn syrup all kinds of sugars for sometime.

2. Deep Fried food

3. Red meat

4. yeast Bread and anything with mold inhibitors, white bread

5. processed foods.

6. Food colors.

7. coffee (not recommended)

8. Night shade vegetables when breakouts are bad. You can take them in moderation once you heal. Watch if there are any triggers.

Egg plant, potato, tomato, chilies, bell pepper are night shades. Some people react more to egg plant. Avoid any green potatoes, green tomatoes as they are higher in solanine. Once you heal completely, control how often and how much you eat nightshades based on your body's reaction. Tomatoes in summer might do more good than harm. Excess tomatoes in winter might harm. Weather has an impact on how we cope with a certain food. Bell peppers even through they are night shade, they may not offend much. Please post your experience.

9. Watch how you react to common allergens, corn, eggs, dairy, wheat, peanuts etc. If you have severe outbreak, you may have to avoid them.

**What to eat/do?**

1. Sun shine when weather is pleasant. If you can get it daily without sunburn that is ideal.

2. Proper hydration(minerals), alkaline water (essentia water), coconut water, herbal teas, eating water rich vegetables in summer. Celery, cucumbers in summer, Make sure you get adequate hydration based on age, weight, exercise and weather. 

3. Exercise walking in sunlight, gardening, any form of exercise you like. But exercising outdoors in sunlight is optimal. Running in sunlight heals fast especially in pleasant weather.

4. Sleep especially at night time.

5. Controlling stress/mindfulness/prayer. Our gut is influenced by stress. Try to reduce stress in general. But if you can't change stressful circumstances, please work on your response to stressors, try to consciously cultivate positive thinking, positive feelings, realistic positive response to situations. Try breathing and prayer to relax. Try to fix what you can. Please don't worry about what you can't fix.

6. Try to get a variety of vegetables that are in season. Get vegetables from all vegetable families/groups. Some root vegetables, some cruciferous vegetables, leafy greens etc. 

7. Eat high fiber, high nutrient less sugary fruits such as, pomegranate, papaya, blue berry, black berry, guava when they are in season.

8. Eat wild caught fish. It heals very well as it is high in DHA. farm raised fish is NOT  healing.

9. Eat some sesame, flax, chia. Soak chia in 10 to 20 times more water for few hours than consume add them to your meals or smoothies.

10. Eat different types of beans. Black beans help with reducing inflammation.

11. Consume turmeric, ginger, cumin, coriander, black seeds(nigella sativa) and other spices as part your diet/food.

12. Cooking oil: Usually olive oil or avocado oil are good. Cold pressed oils are better, Avoid processed industrialized oils and snacks made from them. 

13. Whole grains: Siri Dhanya, millet, rye, teff, whole wheat are okay. 

14. Try eating a salad or drinking green smoothie daily. 

**Supplements**

1. Black seed oil (Nigella sativa)
2. Wild caught fish oil
3. Turmeric
4. Vitamin D
5. Probiotics (Florajen for digestive health)
6. Magnesium (if you have sleep/constipation issues)

**Scalp/Skin Care**

Use gentle dandruff shampoo once or twice a week. If scalp has dandruff, you can try coconut oil, use gentle soft brush to brush off, then shampoo it regularly. Remember not to not transfer fungus from one place to another on skin.

Try epsom salt baths.

**Emotional Care**

Please remember you deserve love and care. Please love and take good care of your body, mind and soul.

Things come back to me in pieces. Some people who were there mere days leading up to his passing will tell me I was sweet, tender, and fierce. Fighting for him every step of the way and also realizing these were his last. Very exhausting. My mother, who had been fighting cancer, decided she was ready for hospice. I stayed with my mom for weeks. My dad, who’s been with her for 50 years, stayed right by her side too. He held her hand. He sang to her. He reassured her. He knew what to say to make her smile. Alone, my dad told me he was worried about us girls (my 3 sisters and myself). He didn’t want to see us hurt. I told him we would be fine. That it would be him who would hurt the most. He said he didn’t know. I asked him, “What is the first thing you think of or do each morning when you wake up?” He replied, “Momma of course. I make sure she’s ok. Get our coffee going and make us breakfast and figure out what she’d want to do for the day.” And so I asked, “What are you going to do when she’s not here to do those things with you?” He was silent. He was silent almost 5 minutes. So I went on and told him that although losing my mother will be difficult, that I’ll still be alright but it’s him who would hurt the most. And I was only telling him from experience. He still didn’t respond. The next few days after that he was different. Maybe I should have said nothing to him. I only thought it fair that I should warn him of what lies ahead. Just like all of us here know now. I wasn’t told this before my husband passed. They’d just tell me it’ll get better. Not that my whole world would be shattered or figuring out how to live without my soulmate. Seeing the love my mother and father shared until she passed was bittersweet. I like to imagine that’s how others seen me and my husband. So last year I lost my husband. This year (just 2 weeks ago) I’ve lost my dear mother. 2026 better give me a break.
