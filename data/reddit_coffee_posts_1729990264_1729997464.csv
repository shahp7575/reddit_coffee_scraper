I’m a history buff and love talking about history related topics. I have some controversial history interests that I love discussing in great detail. I’m also very passionate about international law and legal related issues, as this is my background; learning about other countries and cultures is also neat to discuss. Other than that, I like to spend time outside and read books, and am a coffee snob of sorts. Hope to hear from someone :) ",1,1729997290.0,friendship,1,1.0,False

1gd1ecj,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps30Plus/comments/1gd1ecj/breaking_up_in_your_30s_is_painful/,Breaking Up In Your 30s is PAINFUL,"I (31F) recently broke up a 4 yr relationship with my ex (28M) after a cyclical argument over planning for the future.  For years now, I have been working two jobs to buy a home.  I've been spending a lot of time advancing my career to put myself in a comfortable position financially.  I always made time for him though, planning little trips.  Writing cute notes, cooking him meals.  I feel like I was a great partner up until the very end.  The relationship was very loving and likely the first healthy relationship I've ever been in.  He was incredibly loyal to me, he thought the world of me.  I wish he loved himself the way he loved me.  There was no betrayal, no love lost.

Initially, marriage/motherhood were not things I wanted in life.  When I entered the relationship, this was my stance.  He was working at a coffee shop and living a very peaceful life with zero plans for the future.  I communicated my change of heart in Year 2 of our relationship, thinking that he would be happy as I know he wanted these things too.  I was ready for that next step, after spending 5 years single, becoming the best version of myself.

I really matured over the 4 years we were together.  And, he didnt.  After a while, I grew resentful of his stagnant life even though these were the terms I entered the relationship with.  WHY OH WHY did I think anything was going to change?!?!? I became the naggy girlfriend like ""when are you gunna do this?"" and I started not believing what he was telling me anymore (ex: I promise I will change, I promise I will get a better job).  I started hating who I was becoming in the relationship too, I started putting him down.  I was losing respect for him.  How can you watch me work my ass off while you do nothing to carry this load with me?  I know he loved me, but a part of me thinks he loved what I could provide for him.

We were both on two totally different paths and I think we, both, needed to find someone better suited for those paths.  I wish I could just accept him for who he was, but there was too much I wanted to change.  I never thought I'd be the chick with arbitrary timelines but I became one of those lol... I was so tired of waiting.  And, I know it wasnt fair to put that pressure on him when he wasnt ready for it.",1,1729997223.0,BreakUps30Plus,0,1.0,False

1gd1dlk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gd1dlk,Hey I'm Brett.,"34 and living alone in Rochester since 2019. I'm from Florida originally but have moved around a lot including overseas, most recently I moved from Texas to start over shortly after COVID happened so that shut me down socially for a while along with focusing on building my life up again. I like where I'm at now and have been feeling more adjusted here. I'm  here as a parent to my 17y.o daughter and she's been a big part of my life,  she lives with her mom here and she's been my main attachment to Rochester since 2008.  I'm involved with my daughter's life regularly and on good terms with my kids mom. I also have my cat and dog here that I'm a full-time parent for.. Buddy is my dog and Lucas is the cat, they keep me company and are the best thing in my life on a daily basis. I have a lot of indoor hobbies like games and YouTube but I've also been creating a schedule for myself outside of my apartment at the gym and coffee shops nearby. I would like to meet someone that is interested in getting to know me and to get out and explore Rochester with them. I'm visually impaired and live on social security income while supplementing that income with full-time plasma donations and I'm making the most out of that for myself. I have a long history of labor work and some retail and restaurant jobs.. I've also attempted college for some time.. I'm getting by now but have a history of wanting more for myself. I'm easy to talk to and look forward to someone seeing this. ",1,1729997147.0,RochesterNYDating,0,1.0,False

1gd1boz,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1gd1boz/not_on_my_wet_wipes/,NOT ON MY WET WIPES!!!,"Hey guys,

  
LET ME START BY saying,

I (M,30)  just arrived back for six hours of work at my apartment, which I share with my female roommate (34-5?). We get along… sometimes. But definitely not lately. I prepare my dinner, enjoy some coffee with milk. Then the inevitable happens—nature calls, and I have to pee. I go and sit, which we agreed on last year. I scan the surroundings as nature takes its flow: some hairs, a clean mirror, a yellowing plant, what? - a wet toilette paper role, a badly cleaned blood stain. Wait... and on my wet wipes (of course we don’t share wet wipes; I have my cheap “manly” ones, and she has hers). Well, on mine, there’s a strange object, see picture if you please. It seems to be toilet paper rolled around something, covered in blood. Is there a tampon inside? A dead animal? I don’t know, and I won’t venture to ask. My roommate is in her room or out. I don’t want to talk about it now, so I go to my room, chat with a friend, but nature calls again. I see the bloody object again. And it doesn’t leave my brain for hours. I do what any other person would do—open Google and consult ChatGPT. I start to write a small letter to share my complaints with the creator of that masterpiece, supervised by my new companion Chati PiTi, and after an hour, I’m done with it. I’m satisfied with it. Don’t get me wrong, I started out quite passive-aggressive—not intentionally, but again, nature takes its flow. My supervisor Chati PiTi tamed me, and I bit back; supervisors always win unless you quit. So here I am with the draft. My question is, is my letter, aka WhatsApp message, too much? Am I the asshole roommate?

For additional info:  
We get along sometimes, but in the last three months, things have been tense! It would take a few other posts to explain. We have some clear, explicit rules for the bathroom. Last year, after living together for a while, she asked how I pee. I said normally, standing. She asked if I could sit instead. I agreed and said, yeah, klaro! The next ten days, more or less, she asked me at least once daily how I was peeing. On about day 10, she asks, “HOW DID YOU PEE TODAY?” I said, “Pretty good!” No, just kidding—I said, “Yeah, sometimes sitting, sometimes standing.” She screams without screaming; you know what I mean. Then she blurts something like, it’s unhygienic (true, I agree) and that I promised something (I’m pretty sure I said I’d *try*, since I don’t like to make absolute promises—makes it easier to break them; call it scoundrel wisdom) and that trust was lost or something along those lines. Maybe I’m exaggerating, but something tells me I’m not. I felt attacked, so I countered with the period stains in the bathroom, pointing out that it was also unhygienic and that I was trying to break a habit of 29 years, so it was hard to remember what the body has automated. Plus, it was humiliating to be asked daily how I peed. We kind of went on with our lives after that. I now pee seated, ALWAYS—except in restaurants with male urinals, which makes me feel dignified and adds to the experience of going out. My little secret between me and the public toilets. Well, strange turn. So, here’s the point: I was offended and felt like she was in the wrong. But what’s wrong and right—am I right?

Anyway, with that context, here’s the Frankenletter, created with love by me and ChatGPT:

\*Hi, sorry to bring up such an uncomfortable topic. I know you’re super busy, but over the last three months, I’ve occasionally noticed blood stains in the bathroom—on the toilet or even sometimes on the sofa blanket in the kitchen. I understand that this can happen to anyone, and I don’t mean to judge. However, finding used toilet paper with blood on my wet wipes today was a bit unsettling for me.

We’ve talked before about hygiene and being considerate of each other in the bathroom. When we had the conversation last year about urinating, we agreed that I would sit rather than stand. I respect your preferences and always sit to urinate, as we discussed. I would appreciate it if you could also respect my needs so that we can maintain a good level of trust day-to-day and avoid any awkward conversations or questions about each other's habits.

I understand that sometimes things slip one’s mind—I totally get that! Since this is the first time something like this has happened, I hope it was just an oversight and doesn’t mean you’re dealing with any health issues. I would just like to ask that personal hygiene items be disposed of in a way that keeps our shared things, or each other’s belongings, clean.

As I said, I know you’re very busy, and I don’t want to intrude, but it was important for me to bring up this topic. I would just appreciate if situations like this could be avoided in the future. If you’d like to discuss it, I’m open to it, though for me, it’s not strictly necessary. No bad blood on my side, pun intended. I hope not on yours too.\*

Let me know if you’d suggest any changes!

Additional info:  
We’ve barely spoken in the last two months, partly because we’re really busy, but also because I feel like I’m avoiding her. She tends to turn our conversations toward her life choices—what she should say to her professor, if she should go to a meeting that was already canceled, how she can get a supervisor, or how she can use ChatGPT for that. It feels like I’m her ChatGPT, and she doesn’t really care about me personally. When she asks about my day, I sometimes feel like she’s expecting me to entertain her. So, I’ve been keeping my distance, which has actually been healthier.

I need to live with her—why? Because she’s my black cat Dorothy! Sadly, that’s not true. I’m just broke and don’t have time to find a new apartment or move. What do you think, people?

Is my text too much? Is my apartment going to be in flames this weekend? Am I the asshole, or should I just place the bloody tissue on her toilet paper and forget about it?

I don’t think my roommate is a bad person, but I believe she can easily take advantage of others and doesn’t think twice about her behavior—some kind of emotional blindness. She did help me out by letting me live with her two years ago, and about 18 months ago, I was paying rent really late, sometimes even a month or 45 days overdue. I’ve tried to correct my ways, and I pay on time now, with only slight delays sometimes. But… there are other issues in daily life that also make me hesitate about sending the message. There are too many to go over now, but they deserve their own posts—like not giving me a key for the mailbox. I don’t know if she was joking when she said she doesn’t want me to see her mail, but after two years, I still don’t have a key. Hope dies last, I guess.

Well, guys, this is my first post—feeling lucky. ChatGPT also checked this text but took a bit too many poetic liberties, so I had to tame it. The child is wild.

I've been working as a waiter at this new place for about a month, and it's much better than the other jobs I've had as a waiter, and better paid too... 

And yet, every day I feel like this job requires to put aside any self respect that I have. Customers treat me like a monkey. Yesterday a customer yelled at me because I told her I needed to check with the kitchen if we could make her a coffee that wasn't contaminated with gluten (we aren't a gluten free restaurant or anything). She said I should be ashamed to show up for work if I can't answer questions without checking with the kitchen. Today I got scolded by the owner for being FOUR minutes late when I regularly work over time since I'm always closing. And this is the best job I've had as a student. 

I don't know what to do, I'm really tired. I love what I study but lately I'm wondering if this is all worth it. I'm tired of switching jobs because I can never find one that actually schedules the hours promised and that doesn't make me feel like death. I don't understand how everyone does it, I put so much effort into what I do and it never feels like it's enough. How does everyone manage to keep showing up for their job? Is everyone just miserable? ",0,1729996856.0,antiwork,0,0.33,False

After lunch, we walked to a nearby coffee shop, so we had to cross a busy intersection. There, we see an old lady (all by herself) j-walking. While she did look both ways before deciding to j-walk, she was clearly not going to make it before the cars would reach the intersection. 

My coworker grabbed me by my jacket, began shaking me, and said “X, you have to do something!” I said “Well what do you want me to do?” to which he proposed I should run out there, lift her off the ground, and carry her to safety. I told him if he felt so strongly he should do it himself. Around this time, the cars are getting close, but thankfully, they stop in time and she crosses the street safely. He said “I’m a proud father of 2 kids with bright futures. Why should I risk my safety for her? How would my kids feel? How would my wife feel? How would my family feel? You need to think about the whole context” I told him then why should I risk my safety then, to which he froze for a few seconds, then said that because I have no kids of my own, I have a bigger obligation than he does to step in. He continues to talk in a condescending manner about things like how “everyone has an obligation to contribute to society in order for it to function” and how “communities only exist because people care for each other.” Sick of hearing all this, I leave pretty soon after getting to the coffeeshop.

However, it doesn’t end there. He’s now sending me texts regarding my “ignorance” and “selfishness” and is attempting to assign me reading in order to “educate me.” I left him on read and he sent me a follow up text saying that he’s gonna call me out at work (via meetings, since he’s remote) for my ignorance. ",2,1729996835.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

Tonight my night shift lead and another coworker contacted me about a guy who called about a third party audit supposedly taking place. Here’s the information my workers gave me:

Joseph Bl_____ (leaving out last name just in case it’s legit)
Regional corporate finance 
Wireless call 

- Called around 9:10pm 
- Asked shift lead her name and age 
- At first asked for a manager
- Said this was a third party audit brought on by store owner
- Said we had counterfeit money in deposits 
- Asking about our deposits 
- Said we needed to make a deposit at Walgreens 
- Asked for a walk through our deposit process 
- Wanted to know how much was in our deposit 
- When told that they were told by management to hang up, guy got upset and told them “that it wasn’t managements place to decide that” 
- Said team of three people would be there by 8am to do the audit bc they didn’t do it over the phone

Luckily they were smart and hung up once he got to the deposit part, but by this point I’m pretty sure they gave some information about the amount of money that we might have or our deposits in general - but my workers did not disclose what exactly the guy might know.

This is most definitely a scam right? My workers let me know that he was pretty upset that they were involving me - so should I actually be worried about people showing up to rob us in the morning? I will be at my store early in the morning so I’m trying to take some precautions :/

Actually, he doesn’t like to be on his back at all. If I even set him down for a minute to put the carrier on or to grab something from the kitchen he screams. If I try to put him down when he’s asleep he instantly wakes up and screams. He will sleep 10-12 hours through the night but only if you are holding him. He will wake up periodically and fuss but typically goes back to sleep. Wakes up once or twice for a quick feed. But if I put him down the hour+ long cycle of trying to put him back to sleep begins again because he is awake just screaming until he’s red in the face. He started teething just shy of turning 3 months and it has made things worse. He is miserable 90% of the time. He hates his play mat, his swing, the car, going for walks. He just cries the entire time. He naps like shit. 20 minutes maybe 2-3 times a day. I try to Bf but he eats so much I don’t produce enough so we supplement with formula as well. When I BF he just latches and unlatches 50+ times a feed to the point my nipples are raw. He fusses the entire time he’s on the breast and just pushes off with his arms or his legs and kicks and flails the entire time, pulling my nipple with his mouth the entire time. He won’t take a pacifier, he won’t chew on teething toys. I am so sleep deprived. My bf and I take shifts holding him but my Bf works shift work so when he is on nights he sleeps all day and is gone all night so I hold the baby for 20 hour straight until he gets home and I can go sleep for a few hours and repeat the process. I don’t even have time to eat or drink water most days and survive off cold coffee and granola bars. We have no friends or family to help. I feel like something is wrong but no one listens. I’m told he likely has colic and reflux and was told to put him on a thickened formula which is extremely expensive even with just supplementing. My gut tells me it’s more than this. I guess I am just venting but has anyone experienced this and have any insight on what it could be? I keep being told it gets better at 3 months but it got worse, then I’m told 4 months they go through sleep regression and then it’s better at 6 months but I’m not sure how much longer I can hang on I am pouring from an empty cup as it is!

(They have changed some things up, but not really.)

Once you arrive at the DELTA campus you'll be directed from the security officers booth to a small lobby and retrieve your name badge and given directions to the building where the day will begin.

You'll wait in the lobby until your host arrives to great you and give you information on the day and try to sell why DELTA is this magnificent company to work for. (Subjective \*\*GOOGLE IT\*\*)

Here you'll see a number of candidates from around the nation just like you.

\- Produce 2 forms of I.D

\- Receive a ZONE (1,2, or 3) - (don't get nervous on placement, this is for organization)

You'll be escorted upstairs where you can leave your luggage and you'll be told to leave everything in that room, (phones, resumes, workbooks, etc.)

Once upstairs you'll be greeted by 20+ current flight attendants clapping and cheering you on (AS IF YOU'VE ALREADY GOTTEN THE POSITION) (You DIDN'T so do not be fooled by this marketing tactic)

Once your belongings and secured you'll be seated by your zones and they will begin telling you about the day.

This is where the fun begins :-)

**Zone 1 will go and complete the 1 on 1 interview first. (You will sit with a current FA and a talent req representative and go over basic STAR questions.)**

**\*\*\* NOOBS: S-Situation | T-Task | A-Action| R-Result (What happened, what was the task, what action did you take and what was the result... Make sure you actions provided a positive result)\*\*\***

They'll talk about themselves for a sec then a little about you....

I do not remember all of the questions but TWO of them for sure is:

1. Tell be about a time you had to work with a co worker with a difficult personality
2. Let's say LAX is where you are assigned. What would that look like for you?

THEY WILL ASK YOU THREE QUESTIONS.

NEXT THEY WILL DO A ROLL PLAY WITH YOU AND THE FA WHERE YOU ARE THE ""PRETEND FA"" AND THEY ARE THE PASSENGER AND THERE IS NO OVERHEAD-BIN SPACE AND YOU HAVE TO ADDRESS THE THEM AND LET THEM KNOW THEY HAVE TO CHECK THERE BAG.

**ZONE 2 will be conducting the ""REACH TEST""**

You'll be asked to remove your shoes (Wear clean socks) and reach with both hands to see if you are able to close the overhead bins. (If you are vertically challenged don't be discouraged, have you ever seen a 6'8 FA? Yeah me neither) Then you'll be asked to sit in a jump-seat and put the seatbelts and place your hands on your knees while you sit.

BUT DON'T BE FOOLED MY GOOD FRIENDS this ""test"" is to see you have visible tattoos on your hands fingers, wrists, etc... while you perform those tasks. this ""test"" is no more then 1 minute long

If you have any TATS...PLEASE PUT ON MAKE UP Or something to cover them. no matter where they are!!!! \*\*Even though yes I have photos of current DELTA FA's with hand, finger, neck, behind ear tats...\*\* contradiction much

**ZONE 3 will be conducting the team exercise (This is where they changed somethings up, ill explain towards the end in case they try to switch it up AGAIN :-) )**

Here you'll team up with 2 other candidates where you have to decide between say 20 issues from most important to least important and place them on a board 1-10

You'll have a ""mingle"" session where they'll tell you to walk around meet and greet blah blah. (they are killing time)

(They are deliberating on who they are keeping and who they are sending home)

Last you'll all be sitting down where they begin to tell you more about the position AS IF YOU ALL GOT THE JOB! Please do not fall for that. They will go over several hot topics like where you'll be based scheduling and pay which is the following:

1. During training in ATL is $7/HR \*\*lol i know\*\* (you will have a room-ate at a hotel during training and be provided meals throughout your training) upon graduation it will start at $35/hr.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*35/HR FLIGHT TIME is when you are paid\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

ie: during boarding you're paid $2 until you depart and take off, that is when your $35/HR Begins.

IE: You have 4 legs (flights) today. Once you get to the airport for your sign in time for say 5am for a 6am departure you are not getting paid your $35/HR until you take off and when you land and get to the gate.  At that time your back to your 2 dollars. So while you're helping passengers board, helping with bags, assisting with needs both pre departure and arrival its 2 bucks....(if you have a 2-3 hour sit time at the next city until your next flight you're being paid your $2 dollars. Rinse and repeat

ALL DAY LONG YOU'LL HERE DELTA MONITORS EVERYTHING DO NOT SHARE WITH YOUR FRIENDS OR ON SOCIAL MEDIA WHAT ALL THAT WENT ON

THEY WILL CALL YOUR NAMES ONE BY ONE ACCORDING TO THE ZONES 1,2, AND 3

If you are called you DID NOT GET THE POSITION!!!

You'll grab your things and are escorted out the building to the airport or wherever you came from

when they say PLEASE LOOK OUT FOR YOUR EMAILS  do not fall for that you DID NOT get the position

(they will say this several times)

Once all of us common folks are escorted out those that remained after all the zones were called, are the ones that are given the CJO- Drug test and background!!!!!! (When you are being walked out the will try and shade and cover who is left with there bodies...\* for conflict prevention reasons (HOW THIS MF make it etccc)\*

I will say this class had so much great talent and they passed on them all. ALL EXCEPT 3/30 of us. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO HAVE AIRLINES EXPERIENCE NOR DO YOU HAVE TO BE SOME PERFECT ROBOT during this event. Those are people eyeballing you as if you're some fish in the barrel do not be intimidated, be your self and give it your best shot. IT IS A POPULARITY CONTEST- It has very little to do with where you are currently, (My class had 10+ current FA's, only one who I adored got through).

I've done this FOUR TIMES, Think about it Ive had to apply, virtual interview and make it to ATL 4 times. How is it that not once that I have received any offer. (Some will say ""yeahh i got it on my 10th try""- BRUH WHAT)

LASTLY PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT GET DISCOURAGED IF YOU ARE NOT SELECTED. DELTA IS ONE FISH IN THE OCEAN. AMERICAN/UNITED/SOUTHWEST are also great companies to join as an FA with WAYYYYYYY better flight benefits\*\*\* GOOGLE IT\*\* (Which is why we obviously initially apply).... Anywho I am current in the business and have plenty of info if needed....let me know.

Good luck peeps....

Team exercise CART

If they decide to do the CART test you will team up the same 3-4 candidates and have to ""build the cart"" with the provided info given on a sheet.

ie: You have a morning flight, place the items on the cart according to info on sheet (Im paraphrasing)

THREE BOTTLES OF WATER ON TOP OF THE CART, NEXT TO THE WATER PLACE CLEAR UPS/COFFEE CUPS in three rows

SERVICE & TRANSITIONS -- 👍 good  
Slow checkin but the woman working here seemed friendly.  
Not friendly enough for a $30 early checkin fee, but friendly...  
MVP employees: N/A  

ROOM \[[guest room](https://youtu.be/GjHYLg-iMWQ)\] -- 👎 poor   
FYI: Motel room -- NOT a hotel. Set expectations accordingly for accommodations.  
Very few positives other than the immense amount of storage.  
negatives:  
Not pretty; felt like a partial renovation.  
""Dingy""; no dusting or deep carpet cleaning.  
Pests 🦟.  
Poor lighting.  

BED [King] -- 👍  good  
Not amazing but surprisingly good considering the state of everything else.
Strong mattress.  
Decent pillow build.  
Comfortable sheets.  
Got good sleep when the other guests weren't talking at their normal volume...  

BATH -- 👎 poor  
I liked the physical, semi-spacious, dimensions of this areas. Cosmetically it was still an eyesore; very worn.  
Some things were new, others were dreary. The budget felt strange...:  a beautiful contemporary wash basin, complimented by cheap soap dispensers falling off the wall.  
The Mystery Soap doesn't lather easily & housekeeping didn't replace toiletries consistently. Just bring a Beauty Bar.  
Fair water pressure & hot temps nearly redeemed the shower experience until I saw how small & dirty the towels were 🤢.  

TV/ENT./ACTIVITIES -- 👎 poor  
BIG big TV -- in fact, it's too big for this room. There's a lack of air flow with this installation, generating a lot of heat.  
Cable services periodically drop & the remote buttons rarely register when pressed. Although there are thousands of channels, they were ultimately a chore to navigate.  

WI-FI & CELL RECEPTION -- 👎 poor  
Free, unencrypted, & performs in the expected range for a budget stay. It's poorly tuned, but no packet loss experienced.  
--Performance--  
Video streaming - bad   
Online gaming - poor   
Video chatting - poor  
--Nerd Stats--  
4-11 Mbps download  
1-11 Mbps upload  
0% packet loss  
42 ms latency  
97 ms jitter  

FOOD & DRINK -- 👍  ok  
The size & design (faux vintage) of the mini fridge was appealing.  
They didn't 'splurge' as much on the microwave, but it was functional & both appliances were clean.  
Vending machines & ice are accessible from the parking lot.  
in-room:  
✅microwave (mini)  
✅mini-fridge (large)  
✅coffee/tea  
❌ wet-bar  
❌ mini-bar  

NOISE --  👎  poor. 
Hope for an upper floor because acoustic are a dead. You can hear everything on the other side of these weak doors.  

LOCATION --  👍 ok.  
In true motel fashion, we're on the side of the road. Functionally not a lot going on in this department.  

RECOMMENDATION  
Final Price: $127.83  
Was it worth it? No.  
Best part: fridge  
It's hard to find a clean, pest-free, motel in SoCal, and this one was no different. On that note, It's also misrepresented as a hotel.  
Overpriced considering the effort, but worst of all: another guest found hidden cameras in the room during the time I was staying here.  
No go.

My partner just bought a new machine and I’m trying to set it up but am having issues that I’m unsure how to fix.

I’ve gone through all the set up of the machine and when I’ve put coffee in the group handle to run a shot, the group handle basket floods from the top and the coffee shot actually comes out as just slightly discoloured water.

I’ve looked through the trouble shooting section of the machine manual but I can’t find anything to help.

I’ve also been a barista for 4 years so usually I can troubleshoot fine but this is not an issue I have ever come across.

Any help and advice would be greatly appreciate! Thank you :)",1,1729995332.0,espresso,8,1.0,False
1gd0vdl,https://www.reddit.com/r/ScaryRealStories/comments/1gd0vdl/taking_walks_used_to_be_a_regular_activity/,Taking Walks Used To Be A Regular Activity ,"  I was once a very active and hobby focused person at a point in my life. I  would take very long walks,hike,bike,and sort of camp out in places relatively close to where I live. By relatively close I mean I was never really more than an hour or hour and a half drive away from home.  One hot August afternoon I decided to visit a somewhat popular nature preserve area maybe a 45 minute drive from home. During the midday it's usually pretty heavily populated with hikers and bird watchers on its many various trails and picnic grounds.  This makes a solo hike comfortable even though I know things can happen in any place at any time.  It was a beautiful day amongst the ducks,herons, osprey, ringneck snakes and gorgeous marsh land I was surrounded by.  An abundance of wildlife and various plants to gaze upon make my mind go to such a peaceful place. Greeting the many other nature seekers along the trails and studying the multitude of signs that map out the 400 acre preserve are standard for myself in these types of places. It wasn't until about an hour in while reading a sign about amphibians in the river winding through the preserve  when I  began to feel a bit uneasy.  A couple of men dressed more like they were hunting rather than just viewing nature passed by. I of course,  greeted them with a wave, head nod, and hello.  They just glared back as they walked slowly past me.  When I continued on I noticed they changed direction and were now following me as I was walking in the direction they came from.  They didn't follow close but were always close enough to see which direction I was going or changed trails.  Trying not to think too deep I just continued on.  After a while I decided I was ready to leave and headed to toward the main trail that leads to the parking area.  Admittedly by this time I  had forgotten all about the interaction with those guys and was more focused on food and a shower.  Leaving the entrance to the main trail and entering the field between there and the parking lot for some reason I decided to jog across the grass to where I was parked. When I reached my car I realized I didn't have my keys.  I take a minute to double check my pockets and look around my car.  I didn't want to seem like some weirdo thief in the parking lot with everyone else out there relaxing and enjoying the day.  Being that I always double check I remember having my keys as I left my car when I first arrived so I had to have of course dropped them.  I then retrace my steps back across the field.  When I reach the trailhead there they were in a patch of grass. As I get back to my car and hop in the driver's seat and put the car in drive I notice something on my windshield.  It was a note.  It only read SEE YOU.  Yes, that is strange but it is a sometimes crowded place during the summer months so I just see it as some goofball's attempt at a prank.  I  start my drive home thinking of what I could eat and what to watch on Netflix when I hop out of the shower.  I make a stop on the way home at a supermarket and pick up one of those precooked heat and eat meals and some fruit. It was baked ziti and some mango slices.  Still not taking the aforementioned note too seriously I pay and leave. When I reach the parking lot just guess what I see. Another SEE YOU note on the back of a very faded but recognizable Harbor Freight Tools receipt. I could see where the receipt was from but not what was purchased. I look around the parking lot and can't see anything or anyone that looks strange or out of place. Tired, I begin home but I take an odd and convoluted route to see if I'm followed. Still nothing strange. I get home shower,eat,Netflix, chill and sleep.  The next morning was a Sunday which is usually my lazy day. I only do laundry and cook or clean and hardly leave home on Sundays. I decided to go out to my car to retrieve some work PPE(personal protection equipment) I keep in a work bag in my trunk so I can wash it for the week's upcoming work load. Opening my front door there was a sticky note gently flapping in the breeze on the storm door. SEE YOU is all it read. This can't be happening is all I think. Who did I tell about going on the nature walk? Who knew where I'd be? This is all I can think because at the time I figured it had to be a joke.  I thought I was sure I wasn't followed or nobody could track me this far without being suspicious or clearly seen.  The work week was normal. Nothing happened that caused me to feel unsafe. But the next weekend was when it started. I like to sit out front on my porch and enjoy some wine at the end of the day a few times a week.  Where I live there aren't really any close neighbors or heavy traffic but I started noticing two cars that would drive slowly by at night. Well one was a car.  There would be an old Pontiac sunfire with a very distinct sound that would come by regularly. It sounded like there was a hole in the muffler and the car was begging to be taken out somewhere to be put down like an injured horse. Then there's a bright red Ford Ranger that sounds like the bed is full of tools and chains that slowly creaks and clanks by.  Pretty much every time I see these vehicles I get a SEE YOU note somewhere on my property. I try to document when I see them and even told a police officer on duty in the area but it's some random when they show up and I'm in a place where the authorities won't get to my property in a short time. The other day I got home from work and when I entered the front door I felt a presence. Nothing was out of order but I just felt like someone had just been in my place.  I check the house top to bottom and it's empty. In my rush to check for intruders I bypassed a single piece of paper on my coffee table. SEE YOU  is all it said.  When I picked it up and started boiling with anger I hear one of the creaky old boards on my back porch squeak. I rush through the kitchen right after I grab the pistol I have hidden stashed away in my hallway and rush out of the backdoor. I see nothing and hear nothing.  Just a light breeze and the wind chimes decorating the rear of my home. Frustrated I go into my bedroom and load the shotgun i keep in my closet.  This old revolver and shotgun hardly cross my mind as I live such a peaceful and quiet life but now I don't know what to think. It was quiet around here for the next couple of days but just last night I woke up around 3am to the sound of very solid and heavy boots on my porch.  I have the shotgun propped up between my bed and nightstand since the previous situation so I grab it and sneak slowly out of my bedroom.  Everything goes quiet. Almost like the crickets and tree frogs took a break.   I swear I could hear the sweat rolling down my forehead. I get to my front door and open it slowly with the shotgun leading the way. When I step out barefoot and shaking I smell cigar smoke and hear a very familiar engine and exhaust note pulling away. It wasn't close but I could see the red glow of taillights going around the bend up the hill from my house.  I type this after spending my breaks at work talking to local authorities about the situation still flabbergasted because I don't have a clue why I'm the focus of this unusual obsession.  I don't plan on going home tonight and I don't know how I'll be able to sleep there without a resolution.  This is unnerving scary and real. I no longer have any interest in hiking, taking walks,or enjoying my outdoor activities.",1,1729995324.0,ScaryRealStories,0,1.0,False

(They have changed some things up, but not really.)

Once you arrive at the DELTA campus you'll be directed from the security officers booth to a small lobby and retrieve your name badge and given directions to the building where the day will begin.

You'll wait in the lobby until your host arrives to great you and give you information on the day and try to sell why DELTA is this magnificent company to work for. (Subjective \*\*GOOGLE IT\*\*)

Here you'll see a number of candidates from around the nation just like you.

\- Produce 2 forms of I.D

\- Receive a ZONE (1,2, or 3) - (don't get nervous on placement, this is for organization)

You'll be escorted upstairs where you can leave your luggage and you'll be told to leave everything in that room, (phones, resumes, workbooks, etc.)

Once upstairs you'll be greeted by 20+ current flight attendants clapping and cheering you on (AS IF YOU'VE ALREADY GOTTEN THE POSITION) (You DIDN'T so do not be fooled by this marketing tactic)

Once your belongings and secured you'll be seated by your zones and they will begin telling you about the day.

This is where the fun begins :-) 

**Zone 1 will go and complete the 1 on 1 interview first. (You will sit with a current FA and a talent req representative and go over basic STAR questions.)** 

**\*\*\* NOOBS: S-Situation | T-Task | A-Action| R-Result (What happened, what was the task, what action did you take and what was the result... Make sure you actions provided a positive result)\*\*\***

They'll talk about themselves for a sec then a little about you....

I do not remember all of the questions but TWO of them for sure is:

1. Tell be about a time you had to work with a co worker with a difficult personality

2. Let's say LAX is where you are assigned. What would that look like for you?

THEY WILL ASK YOU THREE QUESTIONS.

NEXT THEY WILL DO A ROLL PLAY WITH YOU AND THE FA WHERE YOU ARE THE ""PRETEND FA"" AND THEY ARE THE PASSENGER AND THERE IS NO OVERHEAD-BIN SPACE AND YOU HAVE TO ADDRESS THE THEM AND LET THEM KNOW THEY HAVE TO CHECK THERE BAG. 

**ZONE 2 will be conducting the ""REACH TEST""**

You'll be asked to remove your shoes (Wear clean socks) and reach with both hands to see if you are able to close the overhead bins. (If you are vertically challenged don't be discouraged, have you ever seen a 6'8 FA? Yeah me neither) Then you'll be asked to sit in a jump-seat and put the seatbelts and place your hands on your knees while you sit.

BUT DON'T BE FOOLED MY GOOD FRIENDS this ""test"" is to see you have visible tattoos on your hands fingers, wrists, etc... while you perform those tasks. this ""test"" is no more then 1 minute long

If you have any TATS...PLEASE PUT ON MAKE UP Or something to cover them. no matter where they are!!!! \*\*Even though yes I have photos of current DELTA FA's with hand, finger, neck, behind ear tats...\*\* contradiction much

**ZONE 3 will be conducting the team exercise (This is where they changed somethings up, ill explain towards the end in case they try to switch it up AGAIN :-) )**

Here you'll team up with 2 other candidates where you have to decide between say 20 issues from most important to least important and place them on a board 1-10

You'll have a ""mingle"" session where they'll tell you to walk around meet and greet blah blah. (they are killing time)

(They are deliberating on who they are keeping and who they are sending home)

Last you'll all be sitting down where they begin to tell you more about the position AS IF YOU ALL GOT THE JOB! Please do not fall for that. They will go over several hot topics like where you'll be based scheduling and pay which is the following:

1. During training in ATL is $7/HR \*\*lol i know\*\* (you will have a room-ate at a hotel during training and be provided meals throughout your training) upon graduation it will start at $35/hr.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*35/HR FLIGHT TIME is when you are paid\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

ie: during boarding you're paid $2 until you depart and take off, that is when your $35/HR Begins. 

IE: You have 4 legs (flights) today. Once you get to the airport for your sign in time for say 5am for a 6am departure you are not getting paid your $35/HR until you take off and when you land and get to the gate.  At that time your back to your 2 dollars. So while you're helping passengers board, helping with bags, assisting with needs both pre departure and arrival its 2 bucks....(if you have a 2-3 hour sit time at the next city until your next flight you're being paid your $2 dollars. Rinse and repeat

  
ALL DAY LONG YOU'LL HERE DELTA MONITORS EVERYTHING DO NOT SHARE WITH YOUR FRIENDS OR ON SOCIAL MEDIA WHAT ALL THAT WENT ON

THEY WILL CALL YOUR NAMES ONE BY ONE ACCORDING TO THE ZONES 1,2, AND 3

If you are called you DID NOT GET THE POSITION!!!

You'll grab your things and are escorted out the building to the airport or wherever you came from

when they say PLEASE LOOK OUT FOR YOUR EMAILS  do not fall for that you DID NOT get the position

(they will say this several times)

Once all of us common folks are escorted out those that remained after all the zones were called, are the ones that are given the CJO- Drug test and background!!!!!! (When you are being walked out the will try and shade and cover who is left with there bodies...\* for conflict prevention reasons (HOW THIS MF make it etccc)\*

  
I will say this class had so much great talent and they passed on them all. ALL EXCEPT 3/30 of us. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO HAVE AIRLINES EXPERIENCE NOR DO YOU HAVE TO BE SOME PERFECT ROBOT during this event. Those are people eyeballing you as if you're some fish in the barrel do not be intimidated, be your self and give it your best shot. IT IS A POPULARITY CONTEST- It has very little to do with where you are currently, (My class had 10+ current FA's, only one who I adored got through).

I've done this FOUR TIMES, Think about it Ive had to apply, virtual interview and make it to ATL 4 times. How is it that not once that I have received any offer. (Some will say ""yeahh i got it on my 10th try""- BRUH WHAT)

LASTLY PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT GET DISCOURAGED IF YOU ARE NOT SELECTED. DELTA IS ONE FISH IN THE OCEAN. AMERICAN/UNITED/SOUTHWEST are also great companies to join as an FA with WAYYYYYYY better flight benefits\*\*\* GOOGLE IT\*\* (Which is why we obviously initially apply).... Anywho I am current in the business and have plenty of info if needed....let me know. 

Good luck peeps....



Team exercise CART

If they decide to do the CART test you will team up the same 3-4 candidates and have to ""build the cart"" with the provided info given on a sheet.

ie: You have a morning flight, place the items on the cart according to info on sheet (Im paraphrasing)

- The giant TV was a gift. I probably wouldn’t have chosen something this big, but we're trying to make it work!
- I picked the Kivik sofa thinking it’d be super comfy, but I underestimated its size. That’s on me!
- We plan to replace the Kallax shelves with a proper TV stand, and we're also thinking of swapping out the coffee table.

Any suggestions on decor, furniture arrangements, or color accents to make the space feel less cramped? We’re open to all ideas!

1gd0osb,https://www.reddit.com/r/stayawake/comments/1gd0osb/the_mask_of_the_loup_garou/,The Mask of the Loup Garou,"I never should have entered that antique store, and I definitely shouldn’t have bought that mask. Gannon’s is known for buying and selling rare and unique antiques, and I wanted to impress my friends with a unique Halloween costume this year, so I thought the perfect solution would be to get my hands on a genuine antique costume, one of those strange, ultra creepy ones from the 1800’s or earlier. Sure, it would cost me, but can you really put a price on standing out?

The bell over the door jingled dully as I opened the door and walked in. The proprietor, and gray, bent over man with a thick, bushy beard and thick, round rimmed spectacles who was ninety if he was a day casually acknowledged me and went back to the ancient book he was examining.

The store wasn’t big, but it had space, only every last bit of that space was filled with relics of bygone eras. Not the usual furniture, silverware, and paintings of your typical antique shop. No. Everything here had a story, and as such, everything here commanded a premium price.

There was an old cavalry saber that was known to have killed no less than seven men in the Civil War. It even still had flecks of blood from its victims spattered along the blade and hilt. There was an old rope noose that had supposedly been used to hang a witch during the Salem Witch Trials. There was an ancient tome with strange symbols on the cover that once belonged to a European court wizard. There was even a hat that once belonged to a certain H. H. Holmes. The stories attached to each item were historical, mystical, and often macabre. And I loved it.

I didn’t believe in magic or mysticism, angels and demons, or anything else beyond what science could explain. That didn’t mean that I wasn’t fascinated by stories involving them though. How much more interesting would the world be if the supernatural actually did exist? It was a tantalizing proposition, and it’s why I had to buy it as soon as I saw it.

It was a wolf mask. Not a mask made to look like a wolf, but a mask made out of the skin and fur of a wolf’s head and neck. It was a masterful work of preservation and artistry that looked as alive on display that day as the creature itself must have looked in life.

I picked it up carefully, turning it over and around in my hand so I could see it from every angle. The work was beyond fine. I couldn’t even see the seams and threads that held it together. Not a single hair seemed to be missing from the thick, gray fur. The teeth were real, and firmly fixed into the snout. I assumed they were so well-done because the original jaws had been used to form the snarling mouth. The eyes were glass, and far too lifelike for such an aged item. Perfect replicas of thin glass set in the eye sockets.

I had to have it.

I checked the story card next to the original display. The price was outrageous, but I didn’t care. Not only was the mask perfect, but the supposed history couldn’t have been more ideal for the season.

It read simply: *Enchanted mask made from the preserved skin of a Loup Garou slain in Burgundy, France in 1137 AD. Do not wear at night.*

“Oh hohohoho,” I grunted excitedly. “I have plans for you!”

I brought the mask and story card to the checkout. Old man Gannon checked the item, and me with more scrutiny than I was really comfortable with before speaking. “Heed the warning boy,” he said sternly. “It wouldn’t do for you to tempt fate.”

I chuckled, ignoring the fact that he called me “boy”. He was probably the oldest man in town, so everyone was “boy” or “girl” to him. “You don’t have to worry about me,” I assured him. “You got any more documentation that goes with this? If I’m going to fork over two-thousand dollars for a mask, I want as much provenance as I can get.”

Old man Gannon grunted derisively. “Of course I have documents that go with it. A fair few actually. Be sure that you read them and take proper precautions.”

“Of course,” I replied seriously, lying through my teeth. The supernatural is not real after all. It’s a myth, legend, just stories. What this mask was, to me, was the foundation of the absolute best Halloween costume I had ever concocted. Sure, a werewolf costume wouldn’t be especially unique, but with that mask, it would be the most frighteningly real one our town had ever seen.

The old man went into the back room and quickly returned with a binder filled with documents in protectors, and a small leatherbound journal. “These are the provenance,” he declared. “The journal is of particular interest as it belonged to a previous owner of the mask, a Mr. Archibald Wembly of London, wrote it in the years Fifteen-Twelve through Fifteen-Fourteen. He went mad after wearing the mask and killed two people before he was cut down in the street. Witnesses swore that he looked more animal than man before he died. The police report is document one-hundred-twenty-three.”

I set the mask on the counter and quickly leafed through the documents. There were originals, and English translations for each. “All this and you’re only charging two-thousand dollars?” I asked incredulously. “Such a unique relic with this much provenance together . . . it has to be worth more.”

Old man Gannon nodded his head. “Yes. Yes it is,” he confirmed. “I actually paid more for it myself, but . . .” he trailed off. “Something about that particular item unsettles me. I wish to be rid of it sooner rather than later, so I’m taking a loss for my own peace of mind.”

I didn’t question it. If this old man was willing to let his superstitions be my gain, I was perfectly fine with it. I paid for the mask and happily took it home.

Looking back, I should never have been so sure of myself. Nor so proud. Nor so certain about how the world works. The events that followed changed my perspective of the nature of reality itself, and I don’t think I’ll ever be able to go back to how I was.

In my defense, and also to remove any possibility that I can claim ignorance if I get desperate enough, I need to confess that I did read the provenance documents right away. I didn’t read them to get any warnings to heed, or as some kind of user manual. I read them to learn the history of my beautiful, terrifyingly creepy wolf mask. Having the story at the tip of my tongue top tell at will would truly be the icing on what I knew would be a most impressive, and frightening cake, or, rather, costume.

The earliest documents were all about the supposed Loup Garou that was terrorizing the Burgundian countryside, and the hunt to put an end to the gruesome string of murders it was blamed for. Document twenty was a notice celebrating that the foul beast had finally been killed and skinned by a visiting huntsman who only asked to be allowed to keep the skin and take it back to him home as his reward. The local ruler, only too happy to get off so cheaply, permitted it.

The huntsman wrote that he brought the hide to a supposed witch named Lucia, who lived alone on a mountain named Muzsla in modern day Slovakia. He paid her handsomely with instructions to use the hide to create an item of power. One that would make him strong.

Apparently, she obliged, making the wolf mask, and he was happy, but it came with a strict set of rules. 1. Never wear the mask at night. 2. Never wear the mask on the day or night of the full moon. 3. Never wear the mask during the autumnal equinox. 4. Always invoke the name of Christ before donning the mask.

The man must have been wildly superstitious, because he followed the rules religiously. The following documents are filled with fanciful tales of the huntsman performing mighty deeds that led to him earning a minor lordship before retiring to administer his land holdings and eventually dying of old age.

What followed after was one document after another that spoke of the mask passing to a new owner who either did not read, or chose not to follow the rules, and how each one ultimately went mad, committing a varying number of murders, and being either killed during the apprehension, or executed for their crimes. It gained a reputation as a cursed item that turned men into mindless beasts and drove them to kill and even cannibalize their victims.

“Holy crap!” I exclaimed as I finished reading the last page in the binder. “This is even better than I thought! I wonder what that Wembly guy wrote in his diary!”

It was getting late, so I decided to put off reading the diary for another day. I picked up my mask and looked it over, admiring it for both its craftsmanship and its history. “You just might be the coolest thing I’ll ever own,” I said to it as I caressed its cheek.

I looked into the glass eyes, and maybe it was a trick of the light, or maybe it was the lateness of the hour playing tricks with my mind, but I could have sworn those eyes, those glass eyes, looked back at me.

\*\*\*\*

I awoke the next morning to my girlfriend letting herself into my apartment. Her key clicked in the lock, and the door squeaked noisily as she opened it.

“Wake up sleepyhead!” she called.

I sat up and groaned in response as I rubbed the sleep out of my eyes. I checked the clock on my nightstand, saw the time, and got annoyed. “It’s seven a.m. on a Saturday!”

“We have plan’s remember?” she called out. “We’re supposed to . . . what is this?” she asked. Her tone changed from businesslike to pure excitement.

I stepped out of my bedroom clad in nothing but my night pants. She was excitedly holding up the wolf mask and admiring it. “It’s a cursed wolf mask,” I replied with a yawn. “It’s the centerpiece of my Halloween costume this year.”

“It’s looks so real,” she said admiringly, then her expression darkened and she put the mask down on the table. “Did you say ‘cursed’?” she sharply inquired.

“Yeah,” I yawned again. “It’s almost a thousand years old. The documents it came with say that a bunch of its previous owners went psycho and started killing people.”

“And you bought it?” she practically shrieked. “And you’re going to wear it?”

I filled the coffee maker and turned it on. “Don’t tell me you believe in magic, voodoo, curses, and all that nonsense,” I replied tiredly.

She took pause at that. I knew her answer, it was a major point of agreement between us. What science can’t explain either isn’t real, or just hasn’t been properly explained yet. Nothing is supernatural.

She finally replied. It’s just . . .” she paused. “If a bunch of people who owned it really did turn into psycho killers, there’s gotta be something there.”

I poured a cup of black coffee from the still brewing pot and took a sip. It was too hot but I didn’t care. “Sure there is,” I replied. “Social contagion. People believe it’s cursed, so they respond as though it’s cursed. It’s nothing special.”

It must have made sense to her, because he whole attitude changed again. “Have you tried it on yet?” she asked with a slight smile, her fear replaced with the admiration and curiosity she had when she first laid eyes on the mask.

It struck me that I hadn’t, so I picked it up, looked my girlfriend in the eyes, said “Jesus Christ” in a mocking tone, and put it on. It felt . . . perfect, as though it were made just for me. It slipped over my head easily and seemed to snug down to a perfect form fit. It had no odor, and I could see clearly with a full field of view through the glass eyes. “Not until just now,” I replied teasingly.

“EEEEK!” she shrieked.

“What?” I asked, alarmed, turning my head rapidly to see what had so alarmed her.

“The mouth moved when you talked!” she squealed. “It moved, and it moved in a perfect match for your words!”

I cocked my head to the side and looked at her quizzically. “For real?” I asked. It’s moving with my mouth?”

“Yes!’ she said excitedly. “Go see in the mirror!”

I did. I spoke. “Abracadabra, hocus pokus, jiggedy jokeus!” I said to my reflection.

Sure enough, the mouth moved in a lupine imitation of my own mouth movements. The movement were so well synced that I could swear I even saw the lips move although I knew it to be impossible. I took the mask off and admired it with the fattest grin of all time on my face.

“That’s amazing!” I exclaimed. “That old witch was a real master! I didn’t know people even knew how to make a mask’s mouth move in the twelfth century!?

“I know right?” My girlfriend, Tiffany said with as much excitement as I felt. “You’re going to have an amazing Halloween costume this year!”

I removed the mask, smiled at her, an nodded my head in affirmation.

“Just one thing,” she said with a hint of confusion. “What’s with that thing you said before you put the mask on?”

It took me a moment to remember what she was talking about. “Oh!” I snapped my fingers as I remembered. “There was a silly little list of rules, I was mocking them.” I grabbed the folder of provenance and flipped to the page with the rules on it. “See?” I said, pointing at the small passage. “Four ridiculous rules.”

Tiffany read them quickly and looked at me with a touch of confusion. “People actually believed this crap?” she said incredulously.

“I know, right?” I laughed.

She laughed with me for a bit, then stopped suddenly and glared at me. “Wait a minute,” she said sternly. “How much did you pay for this mask anyway?”

\*\*\*\*\*

The next few days were perfectly ordinary until the seventeenth. That was the day I finished assembling my costume, and one of two full moons in a row this year. I remember bringing home a pair of retro ripped jeans to go with the red plaid flannel shirt, theater prop quality werewolf gloves, complete with a set of long claws tipping the fingers, and other clothing reminiscent of an 80’s era movie werewolf.

The sun had set hours earlier. I obtained the pants shopping with Tiffany after our dinner date, and I was absolutely thrilled. I couldn’t wait to try it all on and see how it went together.

It was glorious. I donned the outfit, then slowly, almost ritualistically lowered the mask over my head to complete the costume.

It was like magic in the mirror. I looked myself over, and I loved what I saw. I looked like something out of Teen Wolf, only better. Sure, I could have achieved something very much like it far more cheaply. I could have just gone to Spirit Halloween, bought a costume or a rubber mask, and went to Walmart for finishing touches and adjustments, and done a satisfactory job for under $200, but that’s not what I wanted. I wanted the rizz. I wanted to stand out among all the other costumed partygoers at the fraternity Halloween party. This costume absolutely did it, and I couldn’t have been happier.

In my ecstasy, I noticed a . . . feeling running through my body, as though there was a kind of . . . energy coursing through me. It wasn’t as simple as “a burning in my blood” or “my nerves were on fire”. No, it was a feeling of power, as though I was still myself, but also something . . . more.

I felt as though I could toss four men over my shoulders and run a marathon. I felt as though I could get in a bar fight and kick every ass in the place. I felt . . . godly.

I removed the mask after a few minutes and inspected my outfit without it. I felt normal again, and, somehow, it felt wrong. I felt like my ordinary self was somehow no longer enough. I felt incomplete, like I removed a piece of myself when I removed the mask.

“Stop being ridiculous,” I told my reflection. “You’re letting myth and superstition influence you. You’re better than that!”

And yet, I felt like I was lying to myself. Right there, staring at my reflection, I felt like the man looking back at me wasn’t really me, like something unknowable was missing. I looked at my reflection and it felt as though I was looking at someone else, someone I didn’t really know, and who could never truly know me in return.

I shook my head to clear the strange thoughts and center myself again. “Pictures!” I reminded myself. “Tiffany wanted pictures so she could put together something complementary.”

I took out my phone and held it up to the mirror to take a picture, and paused. I couldn’t send her a picture like this. My costume was incomplete. I needed to wear the mask or else my costume wasn’t really my costume, and how could she possibly match her costume to mine if I sent her an incomplete photo?

I picked up the mask to put it on and paused. I paused to look at it, to admire it. I looked into its lifelike glass eyes. I stroked its fur as though it were a living thing. “You’re mine,” I told it in a low, almost silent voice. “You’re mine, and I am your master!”

I continued to stare into those perfectly crafted glass eyes, losing myself in them, and wanting nothing in the world so much as I wanted to put that mask on and forget myself. Slowly, almost robotically, I raised it up and gently lowered it over my head.

I felt a rush of euphoria, like what I felt earlier only a hundred times more potent. I took my phone in hand, opened the camera app, raised it, and snapped a single picture of myself in the mirror.

I opened text messaging, selected Tiffany, attached the message, and typed the following text: “It’s complete, and now I’m complete.”

I hit send. I looked into the mirror and met my own gaze staring back at me through those glass eyes that had no business looking as real and alive as they did, and then the world went blank.

\*\*\*\*\*

I awoke the next day with no idea where I was. I opened my eyes only to be greeted by the rising sun in the middle of a forest.

A forest?

There was a forest outside of town, but it wasn’t exactly a short walk if you catch my drift.

It was easily a half an hour’s drive once you got out of town, and not exactly the kind of thing you just get up and walk to like you’re taking the dog out to the local community park.

I woke up there, and not on the edge either, but well inside the borders, and I was covered in a red, sticky substance that could only be blood, and my stomach hurt like I had gotten drunk and did my best to eat my own body weight at the local Asian buffet.

“What the . . .” I trailed off as I looked at my hands and arms and was taken aback by the dried red and brown goop covering them. I looked down at myself and saw that I was still in my costume, and my clothing was utterly ruined, covered in a deep red liquid that was surely blood.

I realized that I was still wearing the mask, and I ripped it off of my head in a panic. My breath came in great heaves, uncontrollable, and my head began to swim as I hyperventilated.

I closed my eyes and forced myself to calm down. I made myself breathe slower, and slower, and slower still until I finally brought it down to normal. I focused on my heart rate, and gradually brought it down with a blend of deep breathing and mind clearing.

Once I had myself physically under control, I looked at myself again.

How did I get covered in such a disgustingly massive amount of blood? Why did my stomach hurt so much? How did the wolf mask manage to stay clean when the rest of me was drenched in filth? And why did I-

My stomach finally gave up and rebelled. I dropped the wolf mask and fell to my knees retching and vomiting a copious amount of stomach contents. I vomited even as I found myself losing my breath and desperately wanting to breathe. I vomited even as my lack of breath began to make my head swim. I vomited even as my vision blurred and blackened at the edges.

Then I was able to breathe again. I took in great, gasping gulps of air. I I heaved and panted as I sought to restore my oxygen supply.

Then I vomited again.

If possible, I can say that the second round was worse than the third. It didn’t hit me so continuously as to cut me off from breathing completely like the first round did, but it did let me get just enough breath to barely subsist before striking again until I thought I would surely pass out, and then it subsided just long enough to tease me again before taking over and nearly choking me to death over and over and over again until I wished that I could just die and get it over with,

When I was finally finished, my stomach felt better, but there was glistening pile of partially digested stomach contents all over the ground in front of me. I wish I could say that I knew what I was looking at, but it was all so thoroughly masticated that I couldn’t hope pick one bit from another. All I knew was that none of it looked cooked, and I didn’t see anything that could pass for a vegetable anywhere in the nasty mix.

My stomach felt better though.

I picked up my mask, chose a random direction, and began to walk. I must have chosen well, because after only two hours, I came across a road.

I’m not ignorant. I’ve driven in and out of town plenty of times. I know my way around in town and around the outskirts of my hometown. That’s why I knew that I needed to go left once I reached this road if I wanted to get home. How long would it take? Fucked if I know. All that mattered was I was going the right direction, and the rest would fall into place one way or another.

And fall into place it did. Less than an hour of walking later, A random pickup truck pulled over. The driver listened to my story, and told me to hop in the bed of his truck and he’d take me into town. I did it gratefully, and he was as good as his word, better even. He dropped me off outside my apartment building, told me to stay off the drugs, and went on his merry way.

I went inside, took the elevator to my floor, opened my door without needing to use my key, which was also weird since I never, ever, EVER left my apartment without locking it, and immediately rushed to the shower so I could get clean and feel human again.

I was brushing my teeth for the third time when I heard my phone ringing. It was on the floor, pushed up against the wall under the sink. Why? I don’t know. But I found it, pulled it out, and answered the call.

“Where have you been?” Tiffany practically shrieked in my ear. I’ve been calling and texting all night and I haven’t heard a word from you! If you didn’t pick up the phone this time I was going to call the cops to make sure you weren’t dead!”

On the one hand, it felt surreal being yelled at so mundanely after the freaky mystery I woke up to. On the other, what in the ever-living hell was going on?

I let my girlfriend yell for awhile until she was all shouted out. Then I responded. “I don’t know where I was last night,” I told her in a shaky voice. “One minute I was home, the next I was waking up in the middle of nowhere covered in blood.”

This set off another wave of panicked screeching that eventually settled down into sobbing and expressions of gratitude that I was alright. She told me she was coming right over and hung up before I could protest.

I had a very, very bad feeling about her coming over.

\*\*\*\*\*

It literally took all day to get Tiffany settled down and comfortable with the fact that that, in spite of everything, I was alright. I didn’t tell her about how my body had violently purged my stomach of an inhuman amount of raw flesh shortly after waking up. I was already washed up, and my bloody costume was in the wash getting as clean as I could hope for it to be.

It was actually the laundry that got her settled down. She volunteered to take my costume out of the dryer, and was absolutely delighted to see that I had added to it by dying in a bunch of red and brown staining. “It’s actually looks like you ripped something apart and ate it!” she said excitedly. “You’re so good at making Halloween costumes!”

“Yeah . . .” I said slowly before trailing off. “I modified it . . .”

She didn’t give me a chance to finish my words or my thoughts before she jumped me. Perhaps if she hadn’t been so excited and relieved that I was safe and healthy, things would have turned out differently. Perhaps if our intimate life wasn’t so . . . frequent and vigorous, everything would have turned out differently.

As it was, I succumbed to her passion, and we fell asleep in each other’s arms for an afternoon nap.

\*\*\*\*\*

I awoke before Tiffany did, and I went to the living room to examine the mask. I felt scared holding it. It felt wrong to put my hands upon that artifact, as though I was touching a power I could not hope to control or comprehend.

I turned it over, and over, and over again, examining it to the finest detail.

Why did this mask, out of everything I wore last night, not have a single drop of blood on it? Why was the last thing I could remember putting it on and taking a selfie?

That thought triggered something in me, and I took out my phone. I didn’t have it with me in the forest, and I couldn’t remember checking the picture I took or sending it to Tiffany.

I opened the photos and looked at the last picture I took.

I don’t know what I was expecting. Maybe a photo of myself mid-metamorphosis. Mayne I thought I’d catch myself becoming something other than, well, me. What I actually saw was me, in my costume, with my phone in my hand.

I looked at the picture again, not really believing that it could be so mundane, and I thought I could see something . . . different in those lifelike glass eyes, I though that maybe, just maybe there was a hint of something in there that was not only me. But no. It couldn’t be. The supernatural isn’t real after all. It’s all hokum. Bunk. Small-minded garbage that enlightened people like me didn’t believe in.

The sun had set. It wasn’t down for long, but it was the second day of the rarest kind of blue moon event, the kind where the full moon happens two days in a row. I looked into the eyes of the mask, this perfect, masterfully crafted mask, lifted it up, and lowered it onto my head.

\*\*\*\*\*

I woke up the next morning, the nineteenth of October, a mere week ago to the most horrifying sight of my life.

I awoke on the floor of my own apartment, but once again, I was covered in blood and filth.

“How?” I screamed in horror, not understanding where the ungodly mess had come from.

My stomach was killing me. I rushed to my bathroom and barely made it to the toilet before my stomach decided to evacuate its contents, then and keep evacuating itself even when there was nothing but water and bile left to push out. It went on, and on, and on, until I wished I would just die rather than endure another moment of such violent illness.

I flushed the toilet whenever I had the presence of mind to do so without checking to see what had come out of me. I had seen what came out the day before, and I didn’t want to see it again. Perhaps that’s why I failed to recognize any of the bits and parts, the solid matter mixed in with the wretched fluids that erupted from my stomach and out of my mouth.

Regardless, I was glued to the toilet until my stomach finally settled down after who-knows how long. Then I stripped my bloody clothing and took a shower so hot I felt like it might burn the skin from my bones, and I was okay with that.

I felt dirty inside and out. It was wrong. Wrong in every way. Down to my soul if I had believed it at the time, I felt wrong, dirty, and thoroughly corrupted.

I was in the shower for an hour, lost in feelings rather than thought. Wondering what had happened and how I managed to wind up covered in blood again in my own apartment. It was only when I finally shut off the water and was halfway through drying off that it hit me.

Tiffany!”

I screamed, and I ran to my bedroom.

I burst into my bedroom, and was greeted by the most horrific mess I could possibly imagine. The entire room was splattered with blood and viscera. Not a surface was spared as at least some red drops or other . . . scraps was on every surface, every knick-knack, every everything in the room

My screams only got louder and more insistent as I scanned the room and found the head of Tifany, my beautiful Tiffany, beloved girlfriend of three years, on a pillow, fully detached from her body, lifeless eyes staring off into the void. I hurled myself to it, reaching desperately, not willing to believe in what I was seeing.

I picked it up and stared into her sightless eyes, and burst into tears. “Tiffany,” I sobbed. “How? Why?”

I looked around and took the horrific scene in. I recognized the various parts of my beloved scattered around the room. Legs and arms tossed about, bones scattered all over, looking like they had been gnawed upon by a great beast. And not one of her internal organs to be seen.

I remembered how upset my stomach was when I woke up, and how distended it appeared before I threw up the contents in a prolonged, and violent fit. How much of her had I simply flushed away, not knowing what I was doing because I refused to just open my eyes as I vomited up my sick?

I dropped Tiffany’s head back onto my bed and scrambled to the living room. I picked up the diary of Archibald Wembly and read it thoroughly. Much of it was a repeat of what I had already read before in the other provenance, until I got to the end. Here is what is read:

*I should have listened to the rules. I should have learned from the mistakes of others. I didn’t, and now I am paying the price for my foolishness. The mask is gone, but I can feel it’s influence on me even as I write these words.  I blacked out again last night, and when I awoke this morning, my family was dead, ripped apart from some foul beast. Every last one of them. My wife Abigail, and the children George, Franklin, Erin, and Caleb. All of them were torn apart. Only I was spared, and I was covered in such an amount of blood and gore that it could only have come from many animals, of a family of people. I ignored the rules. I wore the mask at night. I wore it on the full moon. It amused me to do so, and I did it without once invoking the name of Christ for protection.*

*I was a fool, and my family has paid the price for my pride and lack of faith. The mask is gone, but I can still feel it within me somehow, as though it has become a part of me. I do not know what the future will bring, but I fear it will be more bloodshed, and it will be me in some beastly form, rending apart my fellow man in bestial glee.*

*I only hope that someone stops me before I go too far.*

*God help me and spare the innocent.*

I put the diary down and sat back stunned, then it dawned on me: Where was the wolf mask?

I tore my apartment searching for it, I really did, but I could not find it. Still, I can feel its presence, like it’s lost, but also not. It’s like it’s here with me even though I cannot see it.

Today is only five days until Halloween. The sun has set, and I feel . . . strong, stronger than I have any right to feel. My dead girlfriend remains rotting in my bedroom, and it smells horrible. The neighbors are sure to complain soon.

I don’t understand what’s going on, but I do know this: I never should have bought that mask, and once I bought it, I never should have broken the rules. How was I supposed to know it was a real cursed object? There’s no science that can explain curses, real, magical curses. Magic isn’t real, right?

Who am I kidding. I believe in magic . . . now. But I came to believe too late. Too late to save my beloved Tiffany, and too late to save myself.

I need to flee. I need to get away from here, as soon as possible. I can feel the beast inside of me, and it wants to get out. I need to get as far away from people as possible, to disappear and never be seen again.

But I’m hungry, and there’s a great nightclub not far from here, and the night is young.

1gd0ohd,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1gd0ohd/the_mask_of_the_loup_garou/,The Mask of the Loup Garou,"I never should have entered that antique store, and I definitely shouldn’t have bought that mask. Gannon’s is known for buying and selling rare and unique antiques, and I wanted to impress my friends with a unique Halloween costume this year, so I thought the perfect solution would be to get my hands on a genuine antique costume, one of those strange, ultra creepy ones from the 1800’s or earlier. Sure, it would cost me, but can you really put a price on standing out?

The bell over the door jingled dully as I opened the door and walked in. The proprietor, and gray, bent over man with a thick, bushy beard and thick, round rimmed spectacles who was ninety if he was a day casually acknowledged me and went back to the ancient book he was examining.

The store wasn’t big, but it had space, only every last bit of that space was filled with relics of bygone eras. Not the usual furniture, silverware, and paintings of your typical antique shop. No. Everything here had a story, and as such, everything here commanded a premium price.

There was an old cavalry saber that was known to have killed no less than seven men in the Civil War. It even still had flecks of blood from its victims spattered along the blade and hilt. There was an old rope noose that had supposedly been used to hang a witch during the Salem Witch Trials. There was an ancient tome with strange symbols on the cover that once belonged to a European court wizard. There was even a hat that once belonged to a certain H. H. Holmes. The stories attached to each item were historical, mystical, and often macabre. And I loved it.

I didn’t believe in magic or mysticism, angels and demons, or anything else beyond what science could explain. That didn’t mean that I wasn’t fascinated by stories involving them though. How much more interesting would the world be if the supernatural actually did exist? It was a tantalizing proposition, and it’s why I had to buy it as soon as I saw it.

It was a wolf mask. Not a mask made to look like a wolf, but a mask made out of the skin and fur of a wolf’s head and neck. It was a masterful work of preservation and artistry that looked as alive on display that day as the creature itself must have looked in life.

I picked it up carefully, turning it over and around in my hand so I could see it from every angle. The work was beyond fine. I couldn’t even see the seams and threads that held it together. Not a single hair seemed to be missing from the thick, gray fur. The teeth were real, and firmly fixed into the snout. I assumed they were so well-done because the original jaws had been used to form the snarling mouth. The eyes were glass, and far too lifelike for such an aged item. Perfect replicas of thin glass set in the eye sockets.

I had to have it.

I checked the story card next to the original display. The price was outrageous, but I didn’t care. Not only was the mask perfect, but the supposed history couldn’t have been more ideal for the season.

It read simply: *Enchanted mask made from the preserved skin of a Loup Garou slain in Burgundy, France in 1137 AD. Do not wear at night.*

“Oh hohohoho,” I grunted excitedly. “I have plans for you!”

I brought the mask and story card to the checkout. Old man Gannon checked the item, and me with more scrutiny than I was really comfortable with before speaking. “Heed the warning boy,” he said sternly. “It wouldn’t do for you to tempt fate.”

I chuckled, ignoring the fact that he called me “boy”. He was probably the oldest man in town, so everyone was “boy” or “girl” to him. “You don’t have to worry about me,” I assured him. “You got any more documentation that goes with this? If I’m going to fork over two-thousand dollars for a mask, I want as much provenance as I can get.”

Old man Gannon grunted derisively. “Of course I have documents that go with it. A fair few actually. Be sure that you read them and take proper precautions.”

“Of course,” I replied seriously, lying through my teeth. The supernatural is not real after all. It’s a myth, legend, just stories. What this mask was, to me, was the foundation of the absolute best Halloween costume I had ever concocted. Sure, a werewolf costume wouldn’t be especially unique, but with that mask, it would be the most frighteningly real one our town had ever seen.

The old man went into the back room and quickly returned with a binder filled with documents in protectors, and a small leatherbound journal. “These are the provenance,” he declared. “The journal is of particular interest as it belonged to a previous owner of the mask, a Mr. Archibald Wembly of London, wrote it in the years Fifteen-Twelve through Fifteen-Fourteen. He went mad after wearing the mask and killed two people before he was cut down in the street. Witnesses swore that he looked more animal than man before he died. The police report is document one-hundred-twenty-three.”

I set the mask on the counter and quickly leafed through the documents. There were originals, and English translations for each. “All this and you’re only charging two-thousand dollars?” I asked incredulously. “Such a unique relic with this much provenance together . . . it has to be worth more.”

Old man Gannon nodded his head. “Yes. Yes it is,” he confirmed. “I actually paid more for it myself, but . . .” he trailed off. “Something about that particular item unsettles me. I wish to be rid of it sooner rather than later, so I’m taking a loss for my own peace of mind.”

I didn’t question it. If this old man was willing to let his superstitions be my gain, I was perfectly fine with it. I paid for the mask and happily took it home.

Looking back, I should never have been so sure of myself. Nor so proud. Nor so certain about how the world works. The events that followed changed my perspective of the nature of reality itself, and I don’t think I’ll ever be able to go back to how I was.

In my defense, and also to remove any possibility that I can claim ignorance if I get desperate enough, I need to confess that I did read the provenance documents right away. I didn’t read them to get any warnings to heed, or as some kind of user manual. I read them to learn the history of my beautiful, terrifyingly creepy wolf mask. Having the story at the tip of my tongue top tell at will would truly be the icing on what I knew would be a most impressive, and frightening cake, or, rather, costume.

The earliest documents were all about the supposed Loup Garou that was terrorizing the Burgundian countryside, and the hunt to put an end to the gruesome string of murders it was blamed for. Document twenty was a notice celebrating that the foul beast had finally been killed and skinned by a visiting huntsman who only asked to be allowed to keep the skin and take it back to him home as his reward. The local ruler, only too happy to get off so cheaply, permitted it.

The huntsman wrote that he brought the hide to a supposed witch named Lucia, who lived alone on a mountain named Muzsla in modern day Slovakia. He paid her handsomely with instructions to use the hide to create an item of power. One that would make him strong.

Apparently, she obliged, making the wolf mask, and he was happy, but it came with a strict set of rules. 1. Never wear the mask at night. 2. Never wear the mask on the day or night of the full moon. 3. Never wear the mask during the autumnal equinox. 4. Always invoke the name of Christ before donning the mask.

The man must have been wildly superstitious, because he followed the rules religiously. The following documents are filled with fanciful tales of the huntsman performing mighty deeds that led to him earning a minor lordship before retiring to administer his land holdings and eventually dying of old age.

What followed after was one document after another that spoke of the mask passing to a new owner who either did not read, or chose not to follow the rules, and how each one ultimately went mad, committing a varying number of murders, and being either killed during the apprehension, or executed for their crimes. It gained a reputation as a cursed item that turned men into mindless beasts and drove them to kill and even cannibalize their victims.

“Holy crap!” I exclaimed as I finished reading the last page in the binder. “This is even better than I thought! I wonder what that Wembly guy wrote in his diary!”

It was getting late, so I decided to put off reading the diary for another day. I picked up my mask and looked it over, admiring it for both its craftsmanship and its history. “You just might be the coolest thing I’ll ever own,” I said to it as I caressed its cheek.

I looked into the glass eyes, and maybe it was a trick of the light, or maybe it was the lateness of the hour playing tricks with my mind, but I could have sworn those eyes, those glass eyes, looked back at me.

\*\*\*\*

I awoke the next morning to my girlfriend letting herself into my apartment. Her key clicked in the lock, and the door squeaked noisily as she opened it.

“Wake up sleepyhead!” she called.

I sat up and groaned in response as I rubbed the sleep out of my eyes. I checked the clock on my nightstand, saw the time, and got annoyed. “It’s seven a.m. on a Saturday!”

“We have plan’s remember?” she called out. “We’re supposed to . . . what is this?” she asked. Her tone changed from businesslike to pure excitement.

I stepped out of my bedroom clad in nothing but my night pants. She was excitedly holding up the wolf mask and admiring it. “It’s a cursed wolf mask,” I replied with a yawn. “It’s the centerpiece of my Halloween costume this year.”

“It’s looks so real,” she said admiringly, then her expression darkened and she put the mask down on the table. “Did you say ‘cursed’?” she sharply inquired.

“Yeah,” I yawned again. “It’s almost a thousand years old. The documents it came with say that a bunch of its previous owners went psycho and started killing people.”

“And you bought it?” she practically shrieked. “And you’re going to wear it?”

I filled the coffee maker and turned it on. “Don’t tell me you believe in magic, voodoo, curses, and all that nonsense,” I replied tiredly.

She took pause at that. I knew her answer, it was a major point of agreement between us. What science can’t explain either isn’t real, or just hasn’t been properly explained yet. Nothing is supernatural.

She finally replied. It’s just . . .” she paused. “If a bunch of people who owned it really did turn into psycho killers, there’s gotta be something there.”

I poured a cup of black coffee from the still brewing pot and took a sip. It was too hot but I didn’t care. “Sure there is,” I replied. “Social contagion. People believe it’s cursed, so they respond as though it’s cursed. It’s nothing special.”

It must have made sense to her, because he whole attitude changed again. “Have you tried it on yet?” she asked with a slight smile, her fear replaced with the admiration and curiosity she had when she first laid eyes on the mask.

It struck me that I hadn’t, so I picked it up, looked my girlfriend in the eyes, said “Jesus Christ” in a mocking tone, and put it on. It felt . . . perfect, as though it were made just for me. It slipped over my head easily and seemed to snug down to a perfect form fit. It had no odor, and I could see clearly with a full field of view through the glass eyes. “Not until just now,” I replied teasingly.

“EEEEK!” she shrieked.

“What?” I asked, alarmed, turning my head rapidly to see what had so alarmed her.

“The mouth moved when you talked!” she squealed. “It moved, and it moved in a perfect match for your words!”

I cocked my head to the side and looked at her quizzically. “For real?” I asked. It’s moving with my mouth?”

“Yes!’ she said excitedly. “Go see in the mirror!”

I did. I spoke. “Abracadabra, hocus pokus, jiggedy jokeus!” I said to my reflection.

Sure enough, the mouth moved in a lupine imitation of my own mouth movements. The movement were so well synced that I could swear I even saw the lips move although I knew it to be impossible. I took the mask off and admired it with the fattest grin of all time on my face.

“That’s amazing!” I exclaimed. “That old witch was a real master! I didn’t know people even knew how to make a mask’s mouth move in the twelfth century!?

“I know right?” My girlfriend, Tiffany said with as much excitement as I felt. “You’re going to have an amazing Halloween costume this year!”

I removed the mask, smiled at her, an nodded my head in affirmation.

“Just one thing,” she said with a hint of confusion. “What’s with that thing you said before you put the mask on?”

It took me a moment to remember what she was talking about. “Oh!” I snapped my fingers as I remembered. “There was a silly little list of rules, I was mocking them.” I grabbed the folder of provenance and flipped to the page with the rules on it. “See?” I said, pointing at the small passage. “Four ridiculous rules.”

Tiffany read them quickly and looked at me with a touch of confusion. “People actually believed this crap?” she said incredulously.

“I know, right?” I laughed.

She laughed with me for a bit, then stopped suddenly and glared at me. “Wait a minute,” she said sternly. “How much did you pay for this mask anyway?”

\*\*\*\*\*

The next few days were perfectly ordinary until the seventeenth. That was the day I finished assembling my costume, and one of two full moons in a row this year. I remember bringing home a pair of retro ripped jeans to go with the red plaid flannel shirt, theater prop quality werewolf gloves, complete with a set of long claws tipping the fingers, and other clothing reminiscent of an 80’s era movie werewolf.

The sun had set hours earlier. I obtained the pants shopping with Tiffany after our dinner date, and I was absolutely thrilled. I couldn’t wait to try it all on and see how it went together.

It was glorious. I donned the outfit, then slowly, almost ritualistically lowered the mask over my head to complete the costume.

It was like magic in the mirror. I looked myself over, and I loved what I saw. I looked like something out of Teen Wolf, only better. Sure, I could have achieved something very much like it far more cheaply. I could have just gone to Spirit Halloween, bought a costume or a rubber mask, and went to Walmart for finishing touches and adjustments, and done a satisfactory job for under $200, but that’s not what I wanted. I wanted the rizz. I wanted to stand out among all the other costumed partygoers at the fraternity Halloween party. This costume absolutely did it, and I couldn’t have been happier.

In my ecstasy, I noticed a . . . feeling running through my body, as though there was a kind of . . . energy coursing through me. It wasn’t as simple as “a burning in my blood” or “my nerves were on fire”. No, it was a feeling of power, as though I was still myself, but also something . . . more.

I felt as though I could toss four men over my shoulders and run a marathon. I felt as though I could get in a bar fight and kick every ass in the place. I felt . . . godly.

I removed the mask after a few minutes and inspected my outfit without it. I felt normal again, and, somehow, it felt wrong. I felt like my ordinary self was somehow no longer enough. I felt incomplete, like I removed a piece of myself when I removed the mask.

“Stop being ridiculous,” I told my reflection. “You’re letting myth and superstition influence you. You’re better than that!”

And yet, I felt like I was lying to myself. Right there, staring at my reflection, I felt like the man looking back at me wasn’t really me, like something unknowable was missing. I looked at my reflection and it felt as though I was looking at someone else, someone I didn’t really know, and who could never truly know me in return.

I shook my head to clear the strange thoughts and center myself again. “Pictures!” I reminded myself. “Tiffany wanted pictures so she could put together something complementary.”

I took out my phone and held it up to the mirror to take a picture, and paused. I couldn’t send her a picture like this. My costume was incomplete. I needed to wear the mask or else my costume wasn’t really my costume, and how could she possibly match her costume to mine if I sent her an incomplete photo?

I picked up the mask to put it on and paused. I paused to look at it, to admire it. I looked into its lifelike glass eyes. I stroked its fur as though it were a living thing. “You’re mine,” I told it in a low, almost silent voice. “You’re mine, and I am your master!”

I continued to stare into those perfectly crafted glass eyes, losing myself in them, and wanting nothing in the world so much as I wanted to put that mask on and forget myself. Slowly, almost robotically, I raised it up and gently lowered it over my head.

I felt a rush of euphoria, like what I felt earlier only a hundred times more potent. I took my phone in hand, opened the camera app, raised it, and snapped a single picture of myself in the mirror.

I opened text messaging, selected Tiffany, attached the message, and typed the following text: “It’s complete, and now I’m complete.”

I hit send. I looked into the mirror and met my own gaze staring back at me through those glass eyes that had no business looking as real and alive as they did, and then the world went blank.

\*\*\*\*\*

I awoke the next day with no idea where I was. I opened my eyes only to be greeted by the rising sun in the middle of a forest.

A forest?

There was a forest outside of town, but it wasn’t exactly a short walk if you catch my drift.

It was easily a half an hour’s drive once you got out of town, and not exactly the kind of thing you just get up and walk to like you’re taking the dog out to the local community park.

I woke up there, and not on the edge either, but well inside the borders, and I was covered in a red, sticky substance that could only be blood, and my stomach hurt like I had gotten drunk and did my best to eat my own body weight at the local Asian buffet.

“What the . . .” I trailed off as I looked at my hands and arms and was taken aback by the dried red and brown goop covering them. I looked down at myself and saw that I was still in my costume, and my clothing was utterly ruined, covered in a deep red liquid that was surely blood.

I realized that I was still wearing the mask, and I ripped it off of my head in a panic. My breath came in great heaves, uncontrollable, and my head began to swim as I hyperventilated.

I closed my eyes and forced myself to calm down. I made myself breathe slower, and slower, and slower still until I finally brought it down to normal. I focused on my heart rate, and gradually brought it down with a blend of deep breathing and mind clearing.

Once I had myself physically under control, I looked at myself again.

How did I get covered in such a disgustingly massive amount of blood? Why did my stomach hurt so much? How did the wolf mask manage to stay clean when the rest of me was drenched in filth? And why did I-

My stomach finally gave up and rebelled. I dropped the wolf mask and fell to my knees retching and vomiting a copious amount of stomach contents. I vomited even as I found myself losing my breath and desperately wanting to breathe. I vomited even as my lack of breath began to make my head swim. I vomited even as my vision blurred and blackened at the edges.

Then I was able to breathe again. I took in great, gasping gulps of air. I I heaved and panted as I sought to restore my oxygen supply.

Then I vomited again.

If possible, I can say that the second round was worse than the third. It didn’t hit me so continuously as to cut me off from breathing completely like the first round did, but it did let me get just enough breath to barely subsist before striking again until I thought I would surely pass out, and then it subsided just long enough to tease me again before taking over and nearly choking me to death over and over and over again until I wished that I could just die and get it over with,

When I was finally finished, my stomach felt better, but there was glistening pile of partially digested stomach contents all over the ground in front of me. I wish I could say that I knew what I was looking at, but it was all so thoroughly masticated that I couldn’t hope pick one bit from another. All I knew was that none of it looked cooked, and I didn’t see anything that could pass for a vegetable anywhere in the nasty mix.

My stomach felt better though.

I picked up my mask, chose a random direction, and began to walk. I must have chosen well, because after only two hours, I came across a road.

I’m not ignorant. I’ve driven in and out of town plenty of times. I know my way around in town and around the outskirts of my hometown. That’s why I knew that I needed to go left once I reached this road if I wanted to get home. How long would it take? Fucked if I know. All that mattered was I was going the right direction, and the rest would fall into place one way or another.

And fall into place it did. Less than an hour of walking later, A random pickup truck pulled over. The driver listened to my story, and told me to hop in the bed of his truck and he’d take me into town. I did it gratefully, and he was as good as his word, better even. He dropped me off outside my apartment building, told me to stay off the drugs, and went on his merry way.

I went inside, took the elevator to my floor, opened my door without needing to use my key, which was also weird since I never, ever, EVER left my apartment without locking it, and immediately rushed to the shower so I could get clean and feel human again.

I was brushing my teeth for the third time when I heard my phone ringing. It was on the floor, pushed up against the wall under the sink. Why? I don’t know. But I found it, pulled it out, and answered the call.

“Where have you been?” Tiffany practically shrieked in my ear. I’ve been calling and texting all night and I haven’t heard a word from you! If you didn’t pick up the phone this time I was going to call the cops to make sure you weren’t dead!”

On the one hand, it felt surreal being yelled at so mundanely after the freaky mystery I woke up to. On the other, what in the ever-living hell was going on?

I let my girlfriend yell for awhile until she was all shouted out. Then I responded. “I don’t know where I was last night,” I told her in a shaky voice. “One minute I was home, the next I was waking up in the middle of nowhere covered in blood.”

This set off another wave of panicked screeching that eventually settled down into sobbing and expressions of gratitude that I was alright. She told me she was coming right over and hung up before I could protest.

I had a very, very bad feeling about her coming over.

\*\*\*\*\*

It literally took all day to get Tiffany settled down and comfortable with the fact that that, in spite of everything, I was alright. I didn’t tell her about how my body had violently purged my stomach of an inhuman amount of raw flesh shortly after waking up. I was already washed up, and my bloody costume was in the wash getting as clean as I could hope for it to be.

It was actually the laundry that got her settled down. She volunteered to take my costume out of the dryer, and was absolutely delighted to see that I had added to it by dying in a bunch of red and brown staining. “It’s actually looks like you ripped something apart and ate it!” she said excitedly. “You’re so good at making Halloween costumes!”

“Yeah . . .” I said slowly before trailing off. “I modified it . . .”

She didn’t give me a chance to finish my words or my thoughts before she jumped me. Perhaps if she hadn’t been so excited and relieved that I was safe and healthy, things would have turned out differently. Perhaps if our intimate life wasn’t so . . . frequent and vigorous, everything would have turned out differently.

As it was, I succumbed to her passion, and we fell asleep in each other’s arms for an afternoon nap.

\*\*\*\*\*

I awoke before Tiffany did, and I went to the living room to examine the mask. I felt scared holding it. It felt wrong to put my hands upon that artifact, as though I was touching a power I could not hope to control or comprehend.

I turned it over, and over, and over again, examining it to the finest detail.

Why did this mask, out of everything I wore last night, not have a single drop of blood on it? Why was the last thing I could remember putting it on and taking a selfie?

That thought triggered something in me, and I took out my phone. I didn’t have it with me in the forest, and I couldn’t remember checking the picture I took or sending it to Tiffany.

I opened the photos and looked at the last picture I took.

I don’t know what I was expecting. Maybe a photo of myself mid-metamorphosis. Mayne I thought I’d catch myself becoming something other than, well, me. What I actually saw was me, in my costume, with my phone in my hand.

I looked at the picture again, not really believing that it could be so mundane, and I thought I could see something . . . different in those lifelike glass eyes, I though that maybe, just maybe there was a hint of something in there that was not only me. But no. It couldn’t be. The supernatural isn’t real after all. It’s all hokum. Bunk. Small-minded garbage that enlightened people like me didn’t believe in.

The sun had set. It wasn’t down for long, but it was the second day of the rarest kind of blue moon event, the kind where the full moon happens two days in a row. I looked into the eyes of the mask, this perfect, masterfully crafted mask, lifted it up, and lowered it onto my head.

\*\*\*\*\*

I woke up the next morning, the nineteenth of October, a mere week ago to the most horrifying sight of my life.

I awoke on the floor of my own apartment, but once again, I was covered in blood and filth.

“How?” I screamed in horror, not understanding where the ungodly mess had come from.

My stomach was killing me. I rushed to my bathroom and barely made it to the toilet before my stomach decided to evacuate its contents, then and keep evacuating itself even when there was nothing but water and bile left to push out. It went on, and on, and on, until I wished I would just die rather than endure another moment of such violent illness.

I flushed the toilet whenever I had the presence of mind to do so without checking to see what had come out of me. I had seen what came out the day before, and I didn’t want to see it again. Perhaps that’s why I failed to recognize any of the bits and parts, the solid matter mixed in with the wretched fluids that erupted from my stomach and out of my mouth.

Regardless, I was glued to the toilet until my stomach finally settled down after who-knows how long. Then I stripped my bloody clothing and took a shower so hot I felt like it might burn the skin from my bones, and I was okay with that.

I felt dirty inside and out. It was wrong. Wrong in every way. Down to my soul if I had believed it at the time, I felt wrong, dirty, and thoroughly corrupted.

I was in the shower for an hour, lost in feelings rather than thought. Wondering what had happened and how I managed to wind up covered in blood again in my own apartment. It was only when I finally shut off the water and was halfway through drying off that it hit me.

Tiffany!”

I screamed, and I ran to my bedroom.

I burst into my bedroom, and was greeted by the most horrific mess I could possibly imagine. The entire room was splattered with blood and viscera. Not a surface was spared as at least some red drops or other . . . scraps was on every surface, every knick-knack, every everything in the room

My screams only got louder and more insistent as I scanned the room and found the head of Tifany, my beautiful Tiffany, beloved girlfriend of three years, on a pillow, fully detached from her body, lifeless eyes staring off into the void. I hurled myself to it, reaching desperately, not willing to believe in what I was seeing.

I picked it up and stared into her sightless eyes, and burst into tears. “Tiffany,” I sobbed. “How? Why?”

I looked around and took the horrific scene in. I recognized the various parts of my beloved scattered around the room. Legs and arms tossed about, bones scattered all over, looking like they had been gnawed upon by a great beast. And not one of her internal organs to be seen.

I remembered how upset my stomach was when I woke up, and how distended it appeared before I threw up the contents in a prolonged, and violent fit. How much of her had I simply flushed away, not knowing what I was doing because I refused to just open my eyes as I vomited up my sick?

I dropped Tiffany’s head back onto my bed and scrambled to the living room. I picked up the diary of Archibald Wembly and read it thoroughly. Much of it was a repeat of what I had already read before in the other provenance, until I got to the end. Here is what is read:

*I should have listened to the rules. I should have learned from the mistakes of others. I didn’t, and now I am paying the price for my foolishness. The mask is gone, but I can feel it’s influence on me even as I write these words.  I blacked out again last night, and when I awoke this morning, my family was dead, ripped apart from some foul beast. Every last one of them. My wife Abigail, and the children George, Franklin, Erin, and Caleb. All of them were torn apart. Only I was spared, and I was covered in such an amount of blood and gore that it could only have come from many animals, of a family of people. I ignored the rules. I wore the mask at night. I wore it on the full moon. It amused me to do so, and I did it without once invoking the name of Christ for protection.*

*I was a fool, and my family has paid the price for my pride and lack of faith. The mask is gone, but I can still feel it within me somehow, as though it has become a part of me. I do not know what the future will bring, but I fear it will be more bloodshed, and it will be me in some beastly form, rending apart my fellow man in bestial glee.*

*I only hope that someone stops me before I go too far.*

*God help me and spare the innocent.*

I put the diary down and sat back stunned, then it dawned on me: Where was the wolf mask?

I tore my apartment searching for it, I really did, but I could not find it. Still, I can feel its presence, like it’s lost, but also not. It’s like it’s here with me even though I cannot see it.

Today is only five days until Halloween. The sun has set, and I feel . . . strong, stronger than I have any right to feel. My dead girlfriend remains rotting in my bedroom, and it smells horrible. The neighbors are sure to complain soon.

I don’t understand what’s going on, but I do know this: I never should have bought that mask, and once I bought it, I never should have broken the rules. How was I supposed to know it was a real cursed object? There’s no science that can explain curses, real, magical curses. Magic isn’t real, right?

Who am I kidding. I believe in magic . . . now. But I came to believe too late. Too late to save my beloved Tiffany, and too late to save myself.

I need to flee. I need to get away from here, as soon as possible. I can feel the beast inside of me, and it wants to get out. I need to get as far away from people as possible, to disappear and never be seen again.

But I’m hungry, and there’s a great nightclub not far from here, and the night is young.

1gd0o2z,https://www.reddit.com/r/NaturesTemper/comments/1gd0o2z/the_mask_of_the_loup_garou/,The Mask of the Loup Garou,"I never should have entered that antique store, and I definitely shouldn’t have bought that mask. Gannon’s is known for buying and selling rare and unique antiques, and I wanted to impress my friends with a unique Halloween costume this year, so I thought the perfect solution would be to get my hands on a genuine antique costume, one of those strange, ultra creepy ones from the 1800’s or earlier. Sure, it would cost me, but can you really put a price on standing out?

The bell over the door jingled dully as I opened the door and walked in. The proprietor, and gray, bent over man with a thick, bushy beard and thick, round rimmed spectacles who was ninety if he was a day casually acknowledged me and went back to the ancient book he was examining.

The store wasn’t big, but it had space, only every last bit of that space was filled with relics of bygone eras. Not the usual furniture, silverware, and paintings of your typical antique shop. No. Everything here had a story, and as such, everything here commanded a premium price.

There was an old cavalry saber that was known to have killed no less than seven men in the Civil War. It even still had flecks of blood from its victims spattered along the blade and hilt. There was an old rope noose that had supposedly been used to hang a witch during the Salem Witch Trials. There was an ancient tome with strange symbols on the cover that once belonged to a European court wizard. There was even a hat that once belonged to a certain H. H. Holmes. The stories attached to each item were historical, mystical, and often macabre. And I loved it.

I didn’t believe in magic or mysticism, angels and demons, or anything else beyond what science could explain. That didn’t mean that I wasn’t fascinated by stories involving them though. How much more interesting would the world be if the supernatural actually did exist? It was a tantalizing proposition, and it’s why I had to buy it as soon as I saw it.

It was a wolf mask. Not a mask made to look like a wolf, but a mask made out of the skin and fur of a wolf’s head and neck. It was a masterful work of preservation and artistry that looked as alive on display that day as the creature itself must have looked in life.

I picked it up carefully, turning it over and around in my hand so I could see it from every angle. The work was beyond fine. I couldn’t even see the seams and threads that held it together. Not a single hair seemed to be missing from the thick, gray fur. The teeth were real, and firmly fixed into the snout. I assumed they were so well-done because the original jaws had been used to form the snarling mouth. The eyes were glass, and far too lifelike for such an aged item. Perfect replicas of thin glass set in the eye sockets.

I had to have it.

I checked the story card next to the original display. The price was outrageous, but I didn’t care. Not only was the mask perfect, but the supposed history couldn’t have been more ideal for the season.

It read simply: *Enchanted mask made from the preserved skin of a Loup Garou slain in Burgundy, France in 1137 AD. Do not wear at night.*

“Oh hohohoho,” I grunted excitedly. “I have plans for you!”

I brought the mask and story card to the checkout. Old man Gannon checked the item, and me with more scrutiny than I was really comfortable with before speaking. “Heed the warning boy,” he said sternly. “It wouldn’t do for you to tempt fate.”

I chuckled, ignoring the fact that he called me “boy”. He was probably the oldest man in town, so everyone was “boy” or “girl” to him. “You don’t have to worry about me,” I assured him. “You got any more documentation that goes with this? If I’m going to fork over two-thousand dollars for a mask, I want as much provenance as I can get.”

Old man Gannon grunted derisively. “Of course I have documents that go with it. A fair few actually. Be sure that you read them and take proper precautions.”

“Of course,” I replied seriously, lying through my teeth. The supernatural is not real after all. It’s a myth, legend, just stories. What this mask was, to me, was the foundation of the absolute best Halloween costume I had ever concocted. Sure, a werewolf costume wouldn’t be especially unique, but with that mask, it would be the most frighteningly real one our town had ever seen.

The old man went into the back room and quickly returned with a binder filled with documents in protectors, and a small leatherbound journal. “These are the provenance,” he declared. “The journal is of particular interest as it belonged to a previous owner of the mask, a Mr. Archibald Wembly of London, wrote it in the years Fifteen-Twelve through Fifteen-Fourteen. He went mad after wearing the mask and killed two people before he was cut down in the street. Witnesses swore that he looked more animal than man before he died. The police report is document one-hundred-twenty-three.”

I set the mask on the counter and quickly leafed through the documents. There were originals, and English translations for each. “All this and you’re only charging two-thousand dollars?” I asked incredulously. “Such a unique relic with this much provenance together . . . it has to be worth more.”

Old man Gannon nodded his head. “Yes. Yes it is,” he confirmed. “I actually paid more for it myself, but . . .” he trailed off. “Something about that particular item unsettles me. I wish to be rid of it sooner rather than later, so I’m taking a loss for my own peace of mind.”

I didn’t question it. If this old man was willing to let his superstitions be my gain, I was perfectly fine with it. I paid for the mask and happily took it home.

Looking back, I should never have been so sure of myself. Nor so proud. Nor so certain about how the world works. The events that followed changed my perspective of the nature of reality itself, and I don’t think I’ll ever be able to go back to how I was.

In my defense, and also to remove any possibility that I can claim ignorance if I get desperate enough, I need to confess that I did read the provenance documents right away. I didn’t read them to get any warnings to heed, or as some kind of user manual. I read them to learn the history of my beautiful, terrifyingly creepy wolf mask. Having the story at the tip of my tongue top tell at will would truly be the icing on what I knew would be a most impressive, and frightening cake, or, rather, costume.

Apparently, she obliged, making the wolf mask, and he was happy, but it came with a strict set of rules. 1. Never wear the mask at night. 2. Never wear the mask on the day or night of the full moon. 3. Never wear the mask during the autumnal equinox. 4. Always invoke the name of Christ before donning the mask.

The man must have been wildly superstitious, because he followed the rules religiously. The following documents are filled with fanciful tales of the huntsman performing mighty deeds that led to him earning a minor lordship before retiring to administer his land holdings and eventually dying of old age.

What followed after was one document after another that spoke of the mask passing to a new owner who either did not read, or chose not to follow the rules, and how each one ultimately went mad, committing a varying number of murders, and being either killed during the apprehension, or executed for their crimes. It gained a reputation as a cursed item that turned men into mindless beasts and drove them to kill and even cannibalize their victims.

“Holy crap!” I exclaimed as I finished reading the last page in the binder. “This is even better than I thought! I wonder what that Wembly guy wrote in his diary!”

It was getting late, so I decided to put off reading the diary for another day. I picked up my mask and looked it over, admiring it for both its craftsmanship and its history. “You just might be the coolest thing I’ll ever own,” I said to it as I caressed its cheek.

I looked into the glass eyes, and maybe it was a trick of the light, or maybe it was the lateness of the hour playing tricks with my mind, but I could have sworn those eyes, those glass eyes, looked back at me.

\*\*\*\*

I awoke the next morning to my girlfriend letting herself into my apartment. Her key clicked in the lock, and the door squeaked noisily as she opened it.

“Wake up sleepyhead!” she called.

I sat up and groaned in response as I rubbed the sleep out of my eyes. I checked the clock on my nightstand, saw the time, and got annoyed. “It’s seven a.m. on a Saturday!”

“We have plan’s remember?” she called out. “We’re supposed to . . . what is this?” she asked. Her tone changed from businesslike to pure excitement.

I stepped out of my bedroom clad in nothing but my night pants. She was excitedly holding up the wolf mask and admiring it. “It’s a cursed wolf mask,” I replied with a yawn. “It’s the centerpiece of my Halloween costume this year.”

“It’s looks so real,” she said admiringly, then her expression darkened and she put the mask down on the table. “Did you say ‘cursed’?” she sharply inquired.

“Yeah,” I yawned again. “It’s almost a thousand years old. The documents it came with say that a bunch of its previous owners went psycho and started killing people.”

“And you bought it?” she practically shrieked. “And you’re going to wear it?”

I filled the coffee maker and turned it on. “Don’t tell me you believe in magic, voodoo, curses, and all that nonsense,” I replied tiredly.

She took pause at that. I knew her answer, it was a major point of agreement between us. What science can’t explain either isn’t real, or just hasn’t been properly explained yet. Nothing is supernatural.

She finally replied. It’s just . . .” she paused. “If a bunch of people who owned it really did turn into psycho killers, there’s gotta be something there.”

I poured a cup of black coffee from the still brewing pot and took a sip. It was too hot but I didn’t care. “Sure there is,” I replied. “Social contagion. People believe it’s cursed, so they respond as though it’s cursed. It’s nothing special.”

It must have made sense to her, because he whole attitude changed again. “Have you tried it on yet?” she asked with a slight smile, her fear replaced with the admiration and curiosity she had when she first laid eyes on the mask.

It struck me that I hadn’t, so I picked it up, looked my girlfriend in the eyes, said “Jesus Christ” in a mocking tone, and put it on. It felt . . . perfect, as though it were made just for me. It slipped over my head easily and seemed to snug down to a perfect form fit. It had no odor, and I could see clearly with a full field of view through the glass eyes. “Not until just now,” I replied teasingly.

“EEEEK!” she shrieked.

“What?” I asked, alarmed, turning my head rapidly to see what had so alarmed her.

“The mouth moved when you talked!” she squealed. “It moved, and it moved in a perfect match for your words!”

I cocked my head to the side and looked at her quizzically. “For real?” I asked. It’s moving with my mouth?”

“Yes!’ she said excitedly. “Go see in the mirror!”

I did. I spoke. “Abracadabra, hocus pokus, jiggedy jokeus!” I said to my reflection.

Sure enough, the mouth moved in a lupine imitation of my own mouth movements. The movement were so well synced that I could swear I even saw the lips move although I knew it to be impossible. I took the mask off and admired it with the fattest grin of all time on my face.

“That’s amazing!” I exclaimed. “That old witch was a real master! I didn’t know people even knew how to make a mask’s mouth move in the twelfth century!?

“I know right?” My girlfriend, Tiffany said with as much excitement as I felt. “You’re going to have an amazing Halloween costume this year!”

I removed the mask, smiled at her, an nodded my head in affirmation.

“Just one thing,” she said with a hint of confusion. “What’s with that thing you said before you put the mask on?”

It took me a moment to remember what she was talking about. “Oh!” I snapped my fingers as I remembered. “There was a silly little list of rules, I was mocking them.” I grabbed the folder of provenance and flipped to the page with the rules on it. “See?” I said, pointing at the small passage. “Four ridiculous rules.”

Tiffany read them quickly and looked at me with a touch of confusion. “People actually believed this crap?” she said incredulously.

“I know, right?” I laughed.

She laughed with me for a bit, then stopped suddenly and glared at me. “Wait a minute,” she said sternly. “How much did you pay for this mask anyway?”

\*\*\*\*\*

The next few days were perfectly ordinary until the seventeenth. That was the day I finished assembling my costume, and one of two full moons in a row this year. I remember bringing home a pair of retro ripped jeans to go with the red plaid flannel shirt, theater prop quality werewolf gloves, complete with a set of long claws tipping the fingers, and other clothing reminiscent of an 80’s era movie werewolf.

The sun had set hours earlier. I obtained the pants shopping with Tiffany after our dinner date, and I was absolutely thrilled. I couldn’t wait to try it all on and see how it went together.

It was glorious. I donned the outfit, then slowly, almost ritualistically lowered the mask over my head to complete the costume.

It was like magic in the mirror. I looked myself over, and I loved what I saw. I looked like something out of Teen Wolf, only better. Sure, I could have achieved something very much like it far more cheaply. I could have just gone to Spirit Halloween, bought a costume or a rubber mask, and went to Walmart for finishing touches and adjustments, and done a satisfactory job for under $200, but that’s not what I wanted. I wanted the rizz. I wanted to stand out among all the other costumed partygoers at the fraternity Halloween party. This costume absolutely did it, and I couldn’t have been happier.

In my ecstasy, I noticed a . . . feeling running through my body, as though there was a kind of . . . energy coursing through me. It wasn’t as simple as “a burning in my blood” or “my nerves were on fire”. No, it was a feeling of power, as though I was still myself, but also something . . . more.

I felt as though I could toss four men over my shoulders and run a marathon. I felt as though I could get in a bar fight and kick every ass in the place. I felt . . . godly.

I removed the mask after a few minutes and inspected my outfit without it. I felt normal again, and, somehow, it felt wrong. I felt like my ordinary self was somehow no longer enough. I felt incomplete, like I removed a piece of myself when I removed the mask.

“Stop being ridiculous,” I told my reflection. “You’re letting myth and superstition influence you. You’re better than that!”

And yet, I felt like I was lying to myself. Right there, staring at my reflection, I felt like the man looking back at me wasn’t really me, like something unknowable was missing. I looked at my reflection and it felt as though I was looking at someone else, someone I didn’t really know, and who could never truly know me in return.

I shook my head to clear the strange thoughts and center myself again. “Pictures!” I reminded myself. “Tiffany wanted pictures so she could put together something complementary.”

I took out my phone and held it up to the mirror to take a picture, and paused. I couldn’t send her a picture like this. My costume was incomplete. I needed to wear the mask or else my costume wasn’t really my costume, and how could she possibly match her costume to mine if I sent her an incomplete photo?

I picked up the mask to put it on and paused. I paused to look at it, to admire it. I looked into its lifelike glass eyes. I stroked its fur as though it were a living thing. “You’re mine,” I told it in a low, almost silent voice. “You’re mine, and I am your master!”

I continued to stare into those perfectly crafted glass eyes, losing myself in them, and wanting nothing in the world so much as I wanted to put that mask on and forget myself. Slowly, almost robotically, I raised it up and gently lowered it over my head.

I felt a rush of euphoria, like what I felt earlier only a hundred times more potent. I took my phone in hand, opened the camera app, raised it, and snapped a single picture of myself in the mirror.

I opened text messaging, selected Tiffany, attached the message, and typed the following text: “It’s complete, and now I’m complete.”

I hit send. I looked into the mirror and met my own gaze staring back at me through those glass eyes that had no business looking as real and alive as they did, and then the world went blank.

\*\*\*\*\*

I awoke the next day with no idea where I was. I opened my eyes only to be greeted by the rising sun in the middle of a forest.

A forest?

There was a forest outside of town, but it wasn’t exactly a short walk if you catch my drift.

It was easily a half an hour’s drive once you got out of town, and not exactly the kind of thing you just get up and walk to like you’re taking the dog out to the local community park.

I woke up there, and not on the edge either, but well inside the borders, and I was covered in a red, sticky substance that could only be blood, and my stomach hurt like I had gotten drunk and did my best to eat my own body weight at the local Asian buffet.

“What the . . .” I trailed off as I looked at my hands and arms and was taken aback by the dried red and brown goop covering them. I looked down at myself and saw that I was still in my costume, and my clothing was utterly ruined, covered in a deep red liquid that was surely blood.

I realized that I was still wearing the mask, and I ripped it off of my head in a panic. My breath came in great heaves, uncontrollable, and my head began to swim as I hyperventilated.

I closed my eyes and forced myself to calm down. I made myself breathe slower, and slower, and slower still until I finally brought it down to normal. I focused on my heart rate, and gradually brought it down with a blend of deep breathing and mind clearing.

Once I had myself physically under control, I looked at myself again.

How did I get covered in such a disgustingly massive amount of blood? Why did my stomach hurt so much? How did the wolf mask manage to stay clean when the rest of me was drenched in filth? And why did I-

My stomach finally gave up and rebelled. I dropped the wolf mask and fell to my knees retching and vomiting a copious amount of stomach contents. I vomited even as I found myself losing my breath and desperately wanting to breathe. I vomited even as my lack of breath began to make my head swim. I vomited even as my vision blurred and blackened at the edges.

Then I was able to breathe again. I took in great, gasping gulps of air. I I heaved and panted as I sought to restore my oxygen supply.

Then I vomited again.

If possible, I can say that the second round was worse than the third. It didn’t hit me so continuously as to cut me off from breathing completely like the first round did, but it did let me get just enough breath to barely subsist before striking again until I thought I would surely pass out, and then it subsided just long enough to tease me again before taking over and nearly choking me to death over and over and over again until I wished that I could just die and get it over with,

When I was finally finished, my stomach felt better, but there was glistening pile of partially digested stomach contents all over the ground in front of me. I wish I could say that I knew what I was looking at, but it was all so thoroughly masticated that I couldn’t hope pick one bit from another. All I knew was that none of it looked cooked, and I didn’t see anything that could pass for a vegetable anywhere in the nasty mix.

My stomach felt better though.

I picked up my mask, chose a random direction, and began to walk. I must have chosen well, because after only two hours, I came across a road.

I’m not ignorant. I’ve driven in and out of town plenty of times. I know my way around in town and around the outskirts of my hometown. That’s why I knew that I needed to go left once I reached this road if I wanted to get home. How long would it take? Fucked if I know. All that mattered was I was going the right direction, and the rest would fall into place one way or another.

And fall into place it did. Less than an hour of walking later, A random pickup truck pulled over. The driver listened to my story, and told me to hop in the bed of his truck and he’d take me into town. I did it gratefully, and he was as good as his word, better even. He dropped me off outside my apartment building, told me to stay off the drugs, and went on his merry way.

I went inside, took the elevator to my floor, opened my door without needing to use my key, which was also weird since I never, ever, EVER left my apartment without locking it, and immediately rushed to the shower so I could get clean and feel human again.

I was brushing my teeth for the third time when I heard my phone ringing. It was on the floor, pushed up against the wall under the sink. Why? I don’t know. But I found it, pulled it out, and answered the call.

“Where have you been?” Tiffany practically shrieked in my ear. I’ve been calling and texting all night and I haven’t heard a word from you! If you didn’t pick up the phone this time I was going to call the cops to make sure you weren’t dead!”

On the one hand, it felt surreal being yelled at so mundanely after the freaky mystery I woke up to. On the other, what in the ever-living hell was going on?

I let my girlfriend yell for awhile until she was all shouted out. Then I responded. “I don’t know where I was last night,” I told her in a shaky voice. “One minute I was home, the next I was waking up in the middle of nowhere covered in blood.”

This set off another wave of panicked screeching that eventually settled down into sobbing and expressions of gratitude that I was alright. She told me she was coming right over and hung up before I could protest.

I had a very, very bad feeling about her coming over.

\*\*\*\*\*

It literally took all day to get Tiffany settled down and comfortable with the fact that that, in spite of everything, I was alright. I didn’t tell her about how my body had violently purged my stomach of an inhuman amount of raw flesh shortly after waking up. I was already washed up, and my bloody costume was in the wash getting as clean as I could hope for it to be.

It was actually the laundry that got her settled down. She volunteered to take my costume out of the dryer, and was absolutely delighted to see that I had added to it by dying in a bunch of red and brown staining. “It’s actually looks like you ripped something apart and ate it!” she said excitedly. “You’re so good at making Halloween costumes!”

“Yeah . . .” I said slowly before trailing off. “I modified it . . .”

She didn’t give me a chance to finish my words or my thoughts before she jumped me. Perhaps if she hadn’t been so excited and relieved that I was safe and healthy, things would have turned out differently. Perhaps if our intimate life wasn’t so . . . frequent and vigorous, everything would have turned out differently.

As it was, I succumbed to her passion, and we fell asleep in each other’s arms for an afternoon nap.

\*\*\*\*\*

I awoke before Tiffany did, and I went to the living room to examine the mask. I felt scared holding it. It felt wrong to put my hands upon that artifact, as though I was touching a power I could not hope to control or comprehend.

I turned it over, and over, and over again, examining it to the finest detail.

Why did this mask, out of everything I wore last night, not have a single drop of blood on it? Why was the last thing I could remember putting it on and taking a selfie?

That thought triggered something in me, and I took out my phone. I didn’t have it with me in the forest, and I couldn’t remember checking the picture I took or sending it to Tiffany.

I opened the photos and looked at the last picture I took.

I don’t know what I was expecting. Maybe a photo of myself mid-metamorphosis. Mayne I thought I’d catch myself becoming something other than, well, me. What I actually saw was me, in my costume, with my phone in my hand.

I looked at the picture again, not really believing that it could be so mundane, and I thought I could see something . . . different in those lifelike glass eyes, I though that maybe, just maybe there was a hint of something in there that was not only me. But no. It couldn’t be. The supernatural isn’t real after all. It’s all hokum. Bunk. Small-minded garbage that enlightened people like me didn’t believe in.

The sun had set. It wasn’t down for long, but it was the second day of the rarest kind of blue moon event, the kind where the full moon happens two days in a row. I looked into the eyes of the mask, this perfect, masterfully crafted mask, lifted it up, and lowered it onto my head.

\*\*\*\*\*

I woke up the next morning, the nineteenth of October, a mere week ago to the most horrifying sight of my life.

I awoke on the floor of my own apartment, but once again, I was covered in blood and filth.

“How?” I screamed in horror, not understanding where the ungodly mess had come from.

My stomach was killing me. I rushed to my bathroom and barely made it to the toilet before my stomach decided to evacuate its contents, then and keep evacuating itself even when there was nothing but water and bile left to push out. It went on, and on, and on, until I wished I would just die rather than endure another moment of such violent illness.

I flushed the toilet whenever I had the presence of mind to do so without checking to see what had come out of me. I had seen what came out the day before, and I didn’t want to see it again. Perhaps that’s why I failed to recognize any of the bits and parts, the solid matter mixed in with the wretched fluids that erupted from my stomach and out of my mouth.

Regardless, I was glued to the toilet until my stomach finally settled down after who-knows how long. Then I stripped my bloody clothing and took a shower so hot I felt like it might burn the skin from my bones, and I was okay with that.

I felt dirty inside and out. It was wrong. Wrong in every way. Down to my soul if I had believed it at the time, I felt wrong, dirty, and thoroughly corrupted.

I was in the shower for an hour, lost in feelings rather than thought. Wondering what had happened and how I managed to wind up covered in blood again in my own apartment. It was only when I finally shut off the water and was halfway through drying off that it hit me.

Tiffany!”

I screamed, and I ran to my bedroom.

I burst into my bedroom, and was greeted by the most horrific mess I could possibly imagine. The entire room was splattered with blood and viscera. Not a surface was spared as at least some red drops or other . . . scraps was on every surface, every knick-knack, every everything in the room

My screams only got louder and more insistent as I scanned the room and found the head of Tifany, my beautiful Tiffany, beloved girlfriend of three years, on a pillow, fully detached from her body, lifeless eyes staring off into the void. I hurled myself to it, reaching desperately, not willing to believe in what I was seeing.

I picked it up and stared into her sightless eyes, and burst into tears. “Tiffany,” I sobbed. “How? Why?”

I looked around and took the horrific scene in. I recognized the various parts of my beloved scattered around the room. Legs and arms tossed about, bones scattered all over, looking like they had been gnawed upon by a great beast. And not one of her internal organs to be seen.

I remembered how upset my stomach was when I woke up, and how distended it appeared before I threw up the contents in a prolonged, and violent fit. How much of her had I simply flushed away, not knowing what I was doing because I refused to just open my eyes as I vomited up my sick?

I dropped Tiffany’s head back onto my bed and scrambled to the living room. I picked up the diary of Archibald Wembly and read it thoroughly. Much of it was a repeat of what I had already read before in the other provenance, until I got to the end. Here is what is read:

*I should have listened to the rules. I should have learned from the mistakes of others. I didn’t, and now I am paying the price for my foolishness. The mask is gone, but I can feel it’s influence on me even as I write these words.  I blacked out again last night, and when I awoke this morning, my family was dead, ripped apart from some foul beast. Every last one of them. My wife Abigail, and the children George, Franklin, Erin, and Caleb. All of them were torn apart. Only I was spared, and I was covered in such an amount of blood and gore that it could only have come from many animals, of a family of people. I ignored the rules. I wore the mask at night. I wore it on the full moon. It amused me to do so, and I did it without once invoking the name of Christ for protection.*

*I was a fool, and my family has paid the price for my pride and lack of faith. The mask is gone, but I can still feel it within me somehow, as though it has become a part of me. I do not know what the future will bring, but I fear it will be more bloodshed, and it will be me in some beastly form, rending apart my fellow man in bestial glee.*

*I only hope that someone stops me before I go too far.*

*God help me and spare the innocent.*

I put the diary down and sat back stunned, then it dawned on me: Where was the wolf mask?

I tore my apartment searching for it, I really did, but I could not find it. Still, I can feel its presence, like it’s lost, but also not. It’s like it’s here with me even though I cannot see it.

Today is only five days until Halloween. The sun has set, and I feel . . . strong, stronger than I have any right to feel. My dead girlfriend remains rotting in my bedroom, and it smells horrible. The neighbors are sure to complain soon.

I don’t understand what’s going on, but I do know this: I never should have bought that mask, and once I bought it, I never should have broken the rules. How was I supposed to know it was a real cursed object? There’s no science that can explain curses, real, magical curses. Magic isn’t real, right?

Who am I kidding. I believe in magic . . . now. But I came to believe too late. Too late to save my beloved Tiffany, and too late to save myself.

I need to flee. I need to get away from here, as soon as possible. I can feel the beast inside of me, and it wants to get out. I need to get as far away from people as possible, to disappear and never be seen again.

But I’m hungry, and there’s a great nightclub not far from here, and the night is young.

1gd0ntl,https://www.reddit.com/r/MrCreepyPasta/comments/1gd0ntl/the_mask_of_the_loup_garou/,The Mask of the Loup Garou,"I never should have entered that antique store, and I definitely shouldn’t have bought that mask. Gannon’s is known for buying and selling rare and unique antiques, and I wanted to impress my friends with a unique Halloween costume this year, so I thought the perfect solution would be to get my hands on a genuine antique costume, one of those strange, ultra creepy ones from the 1800’s or earlier. Sure, it would cost me, but can you really put a price on standing out?

The bell over the door jingled dully as I opened the door and walked in. The proprietor, and gray, bent over man with a thick, bushy beard and thick, round rimmed spectacles who was ninety if he was a day casually acknowledged me and went back to the ancient book he was examining.

The store wasn’t big, but it had space, only every last bit of that space was filled with relics of bygone eras. Not the usual furniture, silverware, and paintings of your typical antique shop. No. Everything here had a story, and as such, everything here commanded a premium price.

There was an old cavalry saber that was known to have killed no less than seven men in the Civil War. It even still had flecks of blood from its victims spattered along the blade and hilt. There was an old rope noose that had supposedly been used to hang a witch during the Salem Witch Trials. There was an ancient tome with strange symbols on the cover that once belonged to a European court wizard. There was even a hat that once belonged to a certain H. H. Holmes. The stories attached to each item were historical, mystical, and often macabre. And I loved it.

I didn’t believe in magic or mysticism, angels and demons, or anything else beyond what science could explain. That didn’t mean that I wasn’t fascinated by stories involving them though. How much more interesting would the world be if the supernatural actually did exist? It was a tantalizing proposition, and it’s why I had to buy it as soon as I saw it.

It was a wolf mask. Not a mask made to look like a wolf, but a mask made out of the skin and fur of a wolf’s head and neck. It was a masterful work of preservation and artistry that looked as alive on display that day as the creature itself must have looked in life.

I picked it up carefully, turning it over and around in my hand so I could see it from every angle. The work was beyond fine. I couldn’t even see the seams and threads that held it together. Not a single hair seemed to be missing from the thick, gray fur. The teeth were real, and firmly fixed into the snout. I assumed they were so well-done because the original jaws had been used to form the snarling mouth. The eyes were glass, and far too lifelike for such an aged item. Perfect replicas of thin glass set in the eye sockets.

I had to have it.

I checked the story card next to the original display. The price was outrageous, but I didn’t care. Not only was the mask perfect, but the supposed history couldn’t have been more ideal for the season.

It read simply: *Enchanted mask made from the preserved skin of a Loup Garou slain in Burgundy, France in 1137 AD. Do not wear at night.*

“Oh hohohoho,” I grunted excitedly. “I have plans for you!”

I brought the mask and story card to the checkout. Old man Gannon checked the item, and me with more scrutiny than I was really comfortable with before speaking. “Heed the warning boy,” he said sternly. “It wouldn’t do for you to tempt fate.”

I chuckled, ignoring the fact that he called me “boy”. He was probably the oldest man in town, so everyone was “boy” or “girl” to him. “You don’t have to worry about me,” I assured him. “You got any more documentation that goes with this? If I’m going to fork over two-thousand dollars for a mask, I want as much provenance as I can get.”

Old man Gannon grunted derisively. “Of course I have documents that go with it. A fair few actually. Be sure that you read them and take proper precautions.”

“Of course,” I replied seriously, lying through my teeth. The supernatural is not real after all. It’s a myth, legend, just stories. What this mask was, to me, was the foundation of the absolute best Halloween costume I had ever concocted. Sure, a werewolf costume wouldn’t be especially unique, but with that mask, it would be the most frighteningly real one our town had ever seen.

The old man went into the back room and quickly returned with a binder filled with documents in protectors, and a small leatherbound journal. “These are the provenance,” he declared. “The journal is of particular interest as it belonged to a previous owner of the mask, a Mr. Archibald Wembly of London, wrote it in the years Fifteen-Twelve through Fifteen-Fourteen. He went mad after wearing the mask and killed two people before he was cut down in the street. Witnesses swore that he looked more animal than man before he died. The police report is document one-hundred-twenty-three.”

I set the mask on the counter and quickly leafed through the documents. There were originals, and English translations for each. “All this and you’re only charging two-thousand dollars?” I asked incredulously. “Such a unique relic with this much provenance together . . . it has to be worth more.”

Old man Gannon nodded his head. “Yes. Yes it is,” he confirmed. “I actually paid more for it myself, but . . .” he trailed off. “Something about that particular item unsettles me. I wish to be rid of it sooner rather than later, so I’m taking a loss for my own peace of mind.”

I didn’t question it. If this old man was willing to let his superstitions be my gain, I was perfectly fine with it. I paid for the mask and happily took it home.

Looking back, I should never have been so sure of myself. Nor so proud. Nor so certain about how the world works. The events that followed changed my perspective of the nature of reality itself, and I don’t think I’ll ever be able to go back to how I was.

In my defense, and also to remove any possibility that I can claim ignorance if I get desperate enough, I need to confess that I did read the provenance documents right away. I didn’t read them to get any warnings to heed, or as some kind of user manual. I read them to learn the history of my beautiful, terrifyingly creepy wolf mask. Having the story at the tip of my tongue top tell at will would truly be the icing on what I knew would be a most impressive, and frightening cake, or, rather, costume.

The earliest documents were all about the supposed Loup Garou that was terrorizing the Burgundian countryside, and the hunt to put an end to the gruesome string of murders it was blamed for. Document twenty was a notice celebrating that the foul beast had finally been killed and skinned by a visiting huntsman who only asked to be allowed to keep the skin and take it back to him home as his reward. The local ruler, only too happy to get off so cheaply, permitted it.

The huntsman wrote that he brought the hide to a supposed witch named Lucia, who lived alone on a mountain named Muzsla in modern day Slovakia. He paid her handsomely with instructions to use the hide to create an item of power. One that would make him strong.

Apparently, she obliged, making the wolf mask, and he was happy, but it came with a strict set of rules. 1. Never wear the mask at night. 2. Never wear the mask on the day or night of the full moon. 3. Never wear the mask during the autumnal equinox. 4. Always invoke the name of Christ before donning the mask.

The man must have been wildly superstitious, because he followed the rules religiously. The following documents are filled with fanciful tales of the huntsman performing mighty deeds that led to him earning a minor lordship before retiring to administer his land holdings and eventually dying of old age.

What followed after was one document after another that spoke of the mask passing to a new owner who either did not read, or chose not to follow the rules, and how each one ultimately went mad, committing a varying number of murders, and being either killed during the apprehension, or executed for their crimes. It gained a reputation as a cursed item that turned men into mindless beasts and drove them to kill and even cannibalize their victims.

“Holy crap!” I exclaimed as I finished reading the last page in the binder. “This is even better than I thought! I wonder what that Wembly guy wrote in his diary!”

It was getting late, so I decided to put off reading the diary for another day. I picked up my mask and looked it over, admiring it for both its craftsmanship and its history. “You just might be the coolest thing I’ll ever own,” I said to it as I caressed its cheek.

I looked into the glass eyes, and maybe it was a trick of the light, or maybe it was the lateness of the hour playing tricks with my mind, but I could have sworn those eyes, those glass eyes, looked back at me.

\*\*\*\*

I awoke the next morning to my girlfriend letting herself into my apartment. Her key clicked in the lock, and the door squeaked noisily as she opened it.

“Wake up sleepyhead!” she called.

I sat up and groaned in response as I rubbed the sleep out of my eyes. I checked the clock on my nightstand, saw the time, and got annoyed. “It’s seven a.m. on a Saturday!”

“We have plan’s remember?” she called out. “We’re supposed to . . . what is this?” she asked. Her tone changed from businesslike to pure excitement.

I stepped out of my bedroom clad in nothing but my night pants. She was excitedly holding up the wolf mask and admiring it. “It’s a cursed wolf mask,” I replied with a yawn. “It’s the centerpiece of my Halloween costume this year.”

“It’s looks so real,” she said admiringly, then her expression darkened and she put the mask down on the table. “Did you say ‘cursed’?” she sharply inquired.

“Yeah,” I yawned again. “It’s almost a thousand years old. The documents it came with say that a bunch of its previous owners went psycho and started killing people.”

“And you bought it?” she practically shrieked. “And you’re going to wear it?”

I filled the coffee maker and turned it on. “Don’t tell me you believe in magic, voodoo, curses, and all that nonsense,” I replied tiredly.

She took pause at that. I knew her answer, it was a major point of agreement between us. What science can’t explain either isn’t real, or just hasn’t been properly explained yet. Nothing is supernatural.

She finally replied. It’s just . . .” she paused. “If a bunch of people who owned it really did turn into psycho killers, there’s gotta be something there.”

I poured a cup of black coffee from the still brewing pot and took a sip. It was too hot but I didn’t care. “Sure there is,” I replied. “Social contagion. People believe it’s cursed, so they respond as though it’s cursed. It’s nothing special.”

It must have made sense to her, because he whole attitude changed again. “Have you tried it on yet?” she asked with a slight smile, her fear replaced with the admiration and curiosity she had when she first laid eyes on the mask.

It struck me that I hadn’t, so I picked it up, looked my girlfriend in the eyes, said “Jesus Christ” in a mocking tone, and put it on. It felt . . . perfect, as though it were made just for me. It slipped over my head easily and seemed to snug down to a perfect form fit. It had no odor, and I could see clearly with a full field of view through the glass eyes. “Not until just now,” I replied teasingly.

“EEEEK!” she shrieked.

“What?” I asked, alarmed, turning my head rapidly to see what had so alarmed her.

“The mouth moved when you talked!” she squealed. “It moved, and it moved in a perfect match for your words!”

I cocked my head to the side and looked at her quizzically. “For real?” I asked. It’s moving with my mouth?”

“Yes!’ she said excitedly. “Go see in the mirror!”

I did. I spoke. “Abracadabra, hocus pokus, jiggedy jokeus!” I said to my reflection.

Sure enough, the mouth moved in a lupine imitation of my own mouth movements. The movement were so well synced that I could swear I even saw the lips move although I knew it to be impossible. I took the mask off and admired it with the fattest grin of all time on my face.

“That’s amazing!” I exclaimed. “That old witch was a real master! I didn’t know people even knew how to make a mask’s mouth move in the twelfth century!?

“I know right?” My girlfriend, Tiffany said with as much excitement as I felt. “You’re going to have an amazing Halloween costume this year!”

I removed the mask, smiled at her, an nodded my head in affirmation.

“Just one thing,” she said with a hint of confusion. “What’s with that thing you said before you put the mask on?”

It took me a moment to remember what she was talking about. “Oh!” I snapped my fingers as I remembered. “There was a silly little list of rules, I was mocking them.” I grabbed the folder of provenance and flipped to the page with the rules on it. “See?” I said, pointing at the small passage. “Four ridiculous rules.”

Tiffany read them quickly and looked at me with a touch of confusion. “People actually believed this crap?” she said incredulously.

“I know, right?” I laughed.

She laughed with me for a bit, then stopped suddenly and glared at me. “Wait a minute,” she said sternly. “How much did you pay for this mask anyway?”

\*\*\*\*\*

The next few days were perfectly ordinary until the seventeenth. That was the day I finished assembling my costume, and one of two full moons in a row this year. I remember bringing home a pair of retro ripped jeans to go with the red plaid flannel shirt, theater prop quality werewolf gloves, complete with a set of long claws tipping the fingers, and other clothing reminiscent of an 80’s era movie werewolf.

The sun had set hours earlier. I obtained the pants shopping with Tiffany after our dinner date, and I was absolutely thrilled. I couldn’t wait to try it all on and see how it went together.

It was glorious. I donned the outfit, then slowly, almost ritualistically lowered the mask over my head to complete the costume.

It was like magic in the mirror. I looked myself over, and I loved what I saw. I looked like something out of Teen Wolf, only better. Sure, I could have achieved something very much like it far more cheaply. I could have just gone to Spirit Halloween, bought a costume or a rubber mask, and went to Walmart for finishing touches and adjustments, and done a satisfactory job for under $200, but that’s not what I wanted. I wanted the rizz. I wanted to stand out among all the other costumed partygoers at the fraternity Halloween party. This costume absolutely did it, and I couldn’t have been happier.

In my ecstasy, I noticed a . . . feeling running through my body, as though there was a kind of . . . energy coursing through me. It wasn’t as simple as “a burning in my blood” or “my nerves were on fire”. No, it was a feeling of power, as though I was still myself, but also something . . . more.

I felt as though I could toss four men over my shoulders and run a marathon. I felt as though I could get in a bar fight and kick every ass in the place. I felt . . . godly.

I removed the mask after a few minutes and inspected my outfit without it. I felt normal again, and, somehow, it felt wrong. I felt like my ordinary self was somehow no longer enough. I felt incomplete, like I removed a piece of myself when I removed the mask.

“Stop being ridiculous,” I told my reflection. “You’re letting myth and superstition influence you. You’re better than that!”

And yet, I felt like I was lying to myself. Right there, staring at my reflection, I felt like the man looking back at me wasn’t really me, like something unknowable was missing. I looked at my reflection and it felt as though I was looking at someone else, someone I didn’t really know, and who could never truly know me in return.

I shook my head to clear the strange thoughts and center myself again. “Pictures!” I reminded myself. “Tiffany wanted pictures so she could put together something complementary.”

I took out my phone and held it up to the mirror to take a picture, and paused. I couldn’t send her a picture like this. My costume was incomplete. I needed to wear the mask or else my costume wasn’t really my costume, and how could she possibly match her costume to mine if I sent her an incomplete photo?

I picked up the mask to put it on and paused. I paused to look at it, to admire it. I looked into its lifelike glass eyes. I stroked its fur as though it were a living thing. “You’re mine,” I told it in a low, almost silent voice. “You’re mine, and I am your master!”

I continued to stare into those perfectly crafted glass eyes, losing myself in them, and wanting nothing in the world so much as I wanted to put that mask on and forget myself. Slowly, almost robotically, I raised it up and gently lowered it over my head.

I felt a rush of euphoria, like what I felt earlier only a hundred times more potent. I took my phone in hand, opened the camera app, raised it, and snapped a single picture of myself in the mirror.

I opened text messaging, selected Tiffany, attached the message, and typed the following text: “It’s complete, and now I’m complete.”

I hit send. I looked into the mirror and met my own gaze staring back at me through those glass eyes that had no business looking as real and alive as they did, and then the world went blank.

\*\*\*\*\*

I awoke the next day with no idea where I was. I opened my eyes only to be greeted by the rising sun in the middle of a forest.

A forest?

There was a forest outside of town, but it wasn’t exactly a short walk if you catch my drift.

It was easily a half an hour’s drive once you got out of town, and not exactly the kind of thing you just get up and walk to like you’re taking the dog out to the local community park.

I woke up there, and not on the edge either, but well inside the borders, and I was covered in a red, sticky substance that could only be blood, and my stomach hurt like I had gotten drunk and did my best to eat my own body weight at the local Asian buffet.

“What the . . .” I trailed off as I looked at my hands and arms and was taken aback by the dried red and brown goop covering them. I looked down at myself and saw that I was still in my costume, and my clothing was utterly ruined, covered in a deep red liquid that was surely blood.

I realized that I was still wearing the mask, and I ripped it off of my head in a panic. My breath came in great heaves, uncontrollable, and my head began to swim as I hyperventilated.

I closed my eyes and forced myself to calm down. I made myself breathe slower, and slower, and slower still until I finally brought it down to normal. I focused on my heart rate, and gradually brought it down with a blend of deep breathing and mind clearing.

Once I had myself physically under control, I looked at myself again.

How did I get covered in such a disgustingly massive amount of blood? Why did my stomach hurt so much? How did the wolf mask manage to stay clean when the rest of me was drenched in filth? And why did I-

My stomach finally gave up and rebelled. I dropped the wolf mask and fell to my knees retching and vomiting a copious amount of stomach contents. I vomited even as I found myself losing my breath and desperately wanting to breathe. I vomited even as my lack of breath began to make my head swim. I vomited even as my vision blurred and blackened at the edges.

Then I was able to breathe again. I took in great, gasping gulps of air. I I heaved and panted as I sought to restore my oxygen supply.

Then I vomited again.

If possible, I can say that the second round was worse than the third. It didn’t hit me so continuously as to cut me off from breathing completely like the first round did, but it did let me get just enough breath to barely subsist before striking again until I thought I would surely pass out, and then it subsided just long enough to tease me again before taking over and nearly choking me to death over and over and over again until I wished that I could just die and get it over with,

When I was finally finished, my stomach felt better, but there was glistening pile of partially digested stomach contents all over the ground in front of me. I wish I could say that I knew what I was looking at, but it was all so thoroughly masticated that I couldn’t hope pick one bit from another. All I knew was that none of it looked cooked, and I didn’t see anything that could pass for a vegetable anywhere in the nasty mix.

My stomach felt better though.

I picked up my mask, chose a random direction, and began to walk. I must have chosen well, because after only two hours, I came across a road.

I’m not ignorant. I’ve driven in and out of town plenty of times. I know my way around in town and around the outskirts of my hometown. That’s why I knew that I needed to go left once I reached this road if I wanted to get home. How long would it take? Fucked if I know. All that mattered was I was going the right direction, and the rest would fall into place one way or another.

And fall into place it did. Less than an hour of walking later, A random pickup truck pulled over. The driver listened to my story, and told me to hop in the bed of his truck and he’d take me into town. I did it gratefully, and he was as good as his word, better even. He dropped me off outside my apartment building, told me to stay off the drugs, and went on his merry way.

I went inside, took the elevator to my floor, opened my door without needing to use my key, which was also weird since I never, ever, EVER left my apartment without locking it, and immediately rushed to the shower so I could get clean and feel human again.

I was brushing my teeth for the third time when I heard my phone ringing. It was on the floor, pushed up against the wall under the sink. Why? I don’t know. But I found it, pulled it out, and answered the call.

“Where have you been?” Tiffany practically shrieked in my ear. I’ve been calling and texting all night and I haven’t heard a word from you! If you didn’t pick up the phone this time I was going to call the cops to make sure you weren’t dead!”

On the one hand, it felt surreal being yelled at so mundanely after the freaky mystery I woke up to. On the other, what in the ever-living hell was going on?

I let my girlfriend yell for awhile until she was all shouted out. Then I responded. “I don’t know where I was last night,” I told her in a shaky voice. “One minute I was home, the next I was waking up in the middle of nowhere covered in blood.”

This set off another wave of panicked screeching that eventually settled down into sobbing and expressions of gratitude that I was alright. She told me she was coming right over and hung up before I could protest.

I had a very, very bad feeling about her coming over.

\*\*\*\*\*

It literally took all day to get Tiffany settled down and comfortable with the fact that that, in spite of everything, I was alright. I didn’t tell her about how my body had violently purged my stomach of an inhuman amount of raw flesh shortly after waking up. I was already washed up, and my bloody costume was in the wash getting as clean as I could hope for it to be.

It was actually the laundry that got her settled down. She volunteered to take my costume out of the dryer, and was absolutely delighted to see that I had added to it by dying in a bunch of red and brown staining. “It’s actually looks like you ripped something apart and ate it!” she said excitedly. “You’re so good at making Halloween costumes!”

“Yeah . . .” I said slowly before trailing off. “I modified it . . .”

She didn’t give me a chance to finish my words or my thoughts before she jumped me. Perhaps if she hadn’t been so excited and relieved that I was safe and healthy, things would have turned out differently. Perhaps if our intimate life wasn’t so . . . frequent and vigorous, everything would have turned out differently.

As it was, I succumbed to her passion, and we fell asleep in each other’s arms for an afternoon nap.

\*\*\*\*\*

I awoke before Tiffany did, and I went to the living room to examine the mask. I felt scared holding it. It felt wrong to put my hands upon that artifact, as though I was touching a power I could not hope to control or comprehend.

I turned it over, and over, and over again, examining it to the finest detail.

Why did this mask, out of everything I wore last night, not have a single drop of blood on it? Why was the last thing I could remember putting it on and taking a selfie?

That thought triggered something in me, and I took out my phone. I didn’t have it with me in the forest, and I couldn’t remember checking the picture I took or sending it to Tiffany.

I opened the photos and looked at the last picture I took.

I don’t know what I was expecting. Maybe a photo of myself mid-metamorphosis. Mayne I thought I’d catch myself becoming something other than, well, me. What I actually saw was me, in my costume, with my phone in my hand.

I looked at the picture again, not really believing that it could be so mundane, and I thought I could see something . . . different in those lifelike glass eyes, I though that maybe, just maybe there was a hint of something in there that was not only me. But no. It couldn’t be. The supernatural isn’t real after all. It’s all hokum. Bunk. Small-minded garbage that enlightened people like me didn’t believe in.

The sun had set. It wasn’t down for long, but it was the second day of the rarest kind of blue moon event, the kind where the full moon happens two days in a row. I looked into the eyes of the mask, this perfect, masterfully crafted mask, lifted it up, and lowered it onto my head.

\*\*\*\*\*

I woke up the next morning, the nineteenth of October, a mere week ago to the most horrifying sight of my life.

I awoke on the floor of my own apartment, but once again, I was covered in blood and filth.

“How?” I screamed in horror, not understanding where the ungodly mess had come from.

My stomach was killing me. I rushed to my bathroom and barely made it to the toilet before my stomach decided to evacuate its contents, then and keep evacuating itself even when there was nothing but water and bile left to push out. It went on, and on, and on, until I wished I would just die rather than endure another moment of such violent illness.

I flushed the toilet whenever I had the presence of mind to do so without checking to see what had come out of me. I had seen what came out the day before, and I didn’t want to see it again. Perhaps that’s why I failed to recognize any of the bits and parts, the solid matter mixed in with the wretched fluids that erupted from my stomach and out of my mouth.

Regardless, I was glued to the toilet until my stomach finally settled down after who-knows how long. Then I stripped my bloody clothing and took a shower so hot I felt like it might burn the skin from my bones, and I was okay with that.

I felt dirty inside and out. It was wrong. Wrong in every way. Down to my soul if I had believed it at the time, I felt wrong, dirty, and thoroughly corrupted.

I was in the shower for an hour, lost in feelings rather than thought. Wondering what had happened and how I managed to wind up covered in blood again in my own apartment. It was only when I finally shut off the water and was halfway through drying off that it hit me.

Tiffany!”

I screamed, and I ran to my bedroom.

I burst into my bedroom, and was greeted by the most horrific mess I could possibly imagine. The entire room was splattered with blood and viscera. Not a surface was spared as at least some red drops or other . . . scraps was on every surface, every knick-knack, every everything in the room

My screams only got louder and more insistent as I scanned the room and found the head of Tifany, my beautiful Tiffany, beloved girlfriend of three years, on a pillow, fully detached from her body, lifeless eyes staring off into the void. I hurled myself to it, reaching desperately, not willing to believe in what I was seeing.

I picked it up and stared into her sightless eyes, and burst into tears. “Tiffany,” I sobbed. “How? Why?”

I looked around and took the horrific scene in. I recognized the various parts of my beloved scattered around the room. Legs and arms tossed about, bones scattered all over, looking like they had been gnawed upon by a great beast. And not one of her internal organs to be seen.

I remembered how upset my stomach was when I woke up, and how distended it appeared before I threw up the contents in a prolonged, and violent fit. How much of her had I simply flushed away, not knowing what I was doing because I refused to just open my eyes as I vomited up my sick?

I dropped Tiffany’s head back onto my bed and scrambled to the living room. I picked up the diary of Archibald Wembly and read it thoroughly. Much of it was a repeat of what I had already read before in the other provenance, until I got to the end. Here is what is read:

*I should have listened to the rules. I should have learned from the mistakes of others. I didn’t, and now I am paying the price for my foolishness. The mask is gone, but I can feel it’s influence on me even as I write these words.  I blacked out again last night, and when I awoke this morning, my family was dead, ripped apart from some foul beast. Every last one of them. My wife Abigail, and the children George, Franklin, Erin, and Caleb. All of them were torn apart. Only I was spared, and I was covered in such an amount of blood and gore that it could only have come from many animals, of a family of people. I ignored the rules. I wore the mask at night. I wore it on the full moon. It amused me to do so, and I did it without once invoking the name of Christ for protection.*

*I was a fool, and my family has paid the price for my pride and lack of faith. The mask is gone, but I can still feel it within me somehow, as though it has become a part of me. I do not know what the future will bring, but I fear it will be more bloodshed, and it will be me in some beastly form, rending apart my fellow man in bestial glee.*

*I only hope that someone stops me before I go too far.*

*God help me and spare the innocent.*

I put the diary down and sat back stunned, then it dawned on me: Where was the wolf mask?

I tore my apartment searching for it, I really did, but I could not find it. Still, I can feel its presence, like it’s lost, but also not. It’s like it’s here with me even though I cannot see it.

Today is only five days until Halloween. The sun has set, and I feel . . . strong, stronger than I have any right to feel. My dead girlfriend remains rotting in my bedroom, and it smells horrible. The neighbors are sure to complain soon.

I don’t understand what’s going on, but I do know this: I never should have bought that mask, and once I bought it, I never should have broken the rules. How was I supposed to know it was a real cursed object? There’s no science that can explain curses, real, magical curses. Magic isn’t real, right?

Who am I kidding. I believe in magic . . . now. But I came to believe too late. Too late to save my beloved Tiffany, and too late to save myself.

I need to flee. I need to get away from here, as soon as possible. I can feel the beast inside of me, and it wants to get out. I need to get as far away from people as possible, to disappear and never be seen again.

But I’m hungry, and there’s a great nightclub not far from here, and the night is young.

1gd0nhh,https://www.reddit.com/r/LighthouseHorror/comments/1gd0nhh/the_mask_of_the_loup_garou/,The Mask of the Loup Garou,"I never should have entered that antique store, and I definitely shouldn’t have bought that mask. Gannon’s is known for buying and selling rare and unique antiques, and I wanted to impress my friends with a unique Halloween costume this year, so I thought the perfect solution would be to get my hands on a genuine antique costume, one of those strange, ultra creepy ones from the 1800’s or earlier. Sure, it would cost me, but can you really put a price on standing out?

The bell over the door jingled dully as I opened the door and walked in. The proprietor, and gray, bent over man with a thick, bushy beard and thick, round rimmed spectacles who was ninety if he was a day casually acknowledged me and went back to the ancient book he was examining.

The store wasn’t big, but it had space, only every last bit of that space was filled with relics of bygone eras. Not the usual furniture, silverware, and paintings of your typical antique shop. No. Everything here had a story, and as such, everything here commanded a premium price.

There was an old cavalry saber that was known to have killed no less than seven men in the Civil War. It even still had flecks of blood from its victims spattered along the blade and hilt. There was an old rope noose that had supposedly been used to hang a witch during the Salem Witch Trials. There was an ancient tome with strange symbols on the cover that once belonged to a European court wizard. There was even a hat that once belonged to a certain H. H. Holmes. The stories attached to each item were historical, mystical, and often macabre. And I loved it.

I didn’t believe in magic or mysticism, angels and demons, or anything else beyond what science could explain. That didn’t mean that I wasn’t fascinated by stories involving them though. How much more interesting would the world be if the supernatural actually did exist? It was a tantalizing proposition, and it’s why I had to buy it as soon as I saw it.

It was a wolf mask. Not a mask made to look like a wolf, but a mask made out of the skin and fur of a wolf’s head and neck. It was a masterful work of preservation and artistry that looked as alive on display that day as the creature itself must have looked in life.

I picked it up carefully, turning it over and around in my hand so I could see it from every angle. The work was beyond fine. I couldn’t even see the seams and threads that held it together. Not a single hair seemed to be missing from the thick, gray fur. The teeth were real, and firmly fixed into the snout. I assumed they were so well-done because the original jaws had been used to form the snarling mouth. The eyes were glass, and far too lifelike for such an aged item. Perfect replicas of thin glass set in the eye sockets.

I had to have it.

I checked the story card next to the original display. The price was outrageous, but I didn’t care. Not only was the mask perfect, but the supposed history couldn’t have been more ideal for the season.

It read simply: *Enchanted mask made from the preserved skin of a Loup Garou slain in Burgundy, France in 1137 AD. Do not wear at night.*

“Oh hohohoho,” I grunted excitedly. “I have plans for you!”

I brought the mask and story card to the checkout. Old man Gannon checked the item, and me with more scrutiny than I was really comfortable with before speaking. “Heed the warning boy,” he said sternly. “It wouldn’t do for you to tempt fate.”

I chuckled, ignoring the fact that he called me “boy”. He was probably the oldest man in town, so everyone was “boy” or “girl” to him. “You don’t have to worry about me,” I assured him. “You got any more documentation that goes with this? If I’m going to fork over two-thousand dollars for a mask, I want as much provenance as I can get.”

Old man Gannon grunted derisively. “Of course I have documents that go with it. A fair few actually. Be sure that you read them and take proper precautions.”

“Of course,” I replied seriously, lying through my teeth. The supernatural is not real after all. It’s a myth, legend, just stories. What this mask was, to me, was the foundation of the absolute best Halloween costume I had ever concocted. Sure, a werewolf costume wouldn’t be especially unique, but with that mask, it would be the most frighteningly real one our town had ever seen.

The old man went into the back room and quickly returned with a binder filled with documents in protectors, and a small leatherbound journal. “These are the provenance,” he declared. “The journal is of particular interest as it belonged to a previous owner of the mask, a Mr. Archibald Wembly of London, wrote it in the years Fifteen-Twelve through Fifteen-Fourteen. He went mad after wearing the mask and killed two people before he was cut down in the street. Witnesses swore that he looked more animal than man before he died. The police report is document one-hundred-twenty-three.”

I set the mask on the counter and quickly leafed through the documents. There were originals, and English translations for each. “All this and you’re only charging two-thousand dollars?” I asked incredulously. “Such a unique relic with this much provenance together . . . it has to be worth more.”

Old man Gannon nodded his head. “Yes. Yes it is,” he confirmed. “I actually paid more for it myself, but . . .” he trailed off. “Something about that particular item unsettles me. I wish to be rid of it sooner rather than later, so I’m taking a loss for my own peace of mind.”

I didn’t question it. If this old man was willing to let his superstitions be my gain, I was perfectly fine with it. I paid for the mask and happily took it home.

Looking back, I should never have been so sure of myself. Nor so proud. Nor so certain about how the world works. The events that followed changed my perspective of the nature of reality itself, and I don’t think I’ll ever be able to go back to how I was.

In my defense, and also to remove any possibility that I can claim ignorance if I get desperate enough, I need to confess that I did read the provenance documents right away. I didn’t read them to get any warnings to heed, or as some kind of user manual. I read them to learn the history of my beautiful, terrifyingly creepy wolf mask. Having the story at the tip of my tongue top tell at will would truly be the icing on what I knew would be a most impressive, and frightening cake, or, rather, costume.

The earliest documents were all about the supposed Loup Garou that was terrorizing the Burgundian countryside, and the hunt to put an end to the gruesome string of murders it was blamed for. Document twenty was a notice celebrating that the foul beast had finally been killed and skinned by a visiting huntsman who only asked to be allowed to keep the skin and take it back to him home as his reward. The local ruler, only too happy to get off so cheaply, permitted it.

The huntsman wrote that he brought the hide to a supposed witch named Lucia, who lived alone on a mountain named Muzsla in modern day Slovakia. He paid her handsomely with instructions to use the hide to create an item of power. One that would make him strong.

Apparently, she obliged, making the wolf mask, and he was happy, but it came with a strict set of rules. 1. Never wear the mask at night. 2. Never wear the mask on the day or night of the full moon. 3. Never wear the mask during the autumnal equinox. 4. Always invoke the name of Christ before donning the mask.

The man must have been wildly superstitious, because he followed the rules religiously. The following documents are filled with fanciful tales of the huntsman performing mighty deeds that led to him earning a minor lordship before retiring to administer his land holdings and eventually dying of old age.

What followed after was one document after another that spoke of the mask passing to a new owner who either did not read, or chose not to follow the rules, and how each one ultimately went mad, committing a varying number of murders, and being either killed during the apprehension, or executed for their crimes. It gained a reputation as a cursed item that turned men into mindless beasts and drove them to kill and even cannibalize their victims.

“Holy crap!” I exclaimed as I finished reading the last page in the binder. “This is even better than I thought! I wonder what that Wembly guy wrote in his diary!”

It was getting late, so I decided to put off reading the diary for another day. I picked up my mask and looked it over, admiring it for both its craftsmanship and its history. “You just might be the coolest thing I’ll ever own,” I said to it as I caressed its cheek.

I looked into the glass eyes, and maybe it was a trick of the light, or maybe it was the lateness of the hour playing tricks with my mind, but I could have sworn those eyes, those glass eyes, looked back at me.

\*\*\*\*

I awoke the next morning to my girlfriend letting herself into my apartment. Her key clicked in the lock, and the door squeaked noisily as she opened it.

“Wake up sleepyhead!” she called.

I sat up and groaned in response as I rubbed the sleep out of my eyes. I checked the clock on my nightstand, saw the time, and got annoyed. “It’s seven a.m. on a Saturday!”

“We have plan’s remember?” she called out. “We’re supposed to . . . what is this?” she asked. Her tone changed from businesslike to pure excitement.

I stepped out of my bedroom clad in nothing but my night pants. She was excitedly holding up the wolf mask and admiring it. “It’s a cursed wolf mask,” I replied with a yawn. “It’s the centerpiece of my Halloween costume this year.”

“It’s looks so real,” she said admiringly, then her expression darkened and she put the mask down on the table. “Did you say ‘cursed’?” she sharply inquired.

“Yeah,” I yawned again. “It’s almost a thousand years old. The documents it came with say that a bunch of its previous owners went psycho and started killing people.”

“And you bought it?” she practically shrieked. “And you’re going to wear it?”

I filled the coffee maker and turned it on. “Don’t tell me you believe in magic, voodoo, curses, and all that nonsense,” I replied tiredly.

She took pause at that. I knew her answer, it was a major point of agreement between us. What science can’t explain either isn’t real, or just hasn’t been properly explained yet. Nothing is supernatural.

She finally replied. It’s just . . .” she paused. “If a bunch of people who owned it really did turn into psycho killers, there’s gotta be something there.”

I poured a cup of black coffee from the still brewing pot and took a sip. It was too hot but I didn’t care. “Sure there is,” I replied. “Social contagion. People believe it’s cursed, so they respond as though it’s cursed. It’s nothing special.”

It must have made sense to her, because he whole attitude changed again. “Have you tried it on yet?” she asked with a slight smile, her fear replaced with the admiration and curiosity she had when she first laid eyes on the mask.

It struck me that I hadn’t, so I picked it up, looked my girlfriend in the eyes, said “Jesus Christ” in a mocking tone, and put it on. It felt . . . perfect, as though it were made just for me. It slipped over my head easily and seemed to snug down to a perfect form fit. It had no odor, and I could see clearly with a full field of view through the glass eyes. “Not until just now,” I replied teasingly.

“EEEEK!” she shrieked.

“What?” I asked, alarmed, turning my head rapidly to see what had so alarmed her.

“The mouth moved when you talked!” she squealed. “It moved, and it moved in a perfect match for your words!”

I cocked my head to the side and looked at her quizzically. “For real?” I asked. It’s moving with my mouth?”

“Yes!’ she said excitedly. “Go see in the mirror!”

I did. I spoke. “Abracadabra, hocus pokus, jiggedy jokeus!” I said to my reflection.

Sure enough, the mouth moved in a lupine imitation of my own mouth movements. The movement were so well synced that I could swear I even saw the lips move although I knew it to be impossible. I took the mask off and admired it with the fattest grin of all time on my face.

“That’s amazing!” I exclaimed. “That old witch was a real master! I didn’t know people even knew how to make a mask’s mouth move in the twelfth century!?

“I know right?” My girlfriend, Tiffany said with as much excitement as I felt. “You’re going to have an amazing Halloween costume this year!”

I removed the mask, smiled at her, an nodded my head in affirmation.

“Just one thing,” she said with a hint of confusion. “What’s with that thing you said before you put the mask on?”

It took me a moment to remember what she was talking about. “Oh!” I snapped my fingers as I remembered. “There was a silly little list of rules, I was mocking them.” I grabbed the folder of provenance and flipped to the page with the rules on it. “See?” I said, pointing at the small passage. “Four ridiculous rules.”

Tiffany read them quickly and looked at me with a touch of confusion. “People actually believed this crap?” she said incredulously.

“I know, right?” I laughed.

She laughed with me for a bit, then stopped suddenly and glared at me. “Wait a minute,” she said sternly. “How much did you pay for this mask anyway?”

\*\*\*\*\*

The next few days were perfectly ordinary until the seventeenth. That was the day I finished assembling my costume, and one of two full moons in a row this year. I remember bringing home a pair of retro ripped jeans to go with the red plaid flannel shirt, theater prop quality werewolf gloves, complete with a set of long claws tipping the fingers, and other clothing reminiscent of an 80’s era movie werewolf.

The sun had set hours earlier. I obtained the pants shopping with Tiffany after our dinner date, and I was absolutely thrilled. I couldn’t wait to try it all on and see how it went together.

It was glorious. I donned the outfit, then slowly, almost ritualistically lowered the mask over my head to complete the costume.

It was like magic in the mirror. I looked myself over, and I loved what I saw. I looked like something out of Teen Wolf, only better. Sure, I could have achieved something very much like it far more cheaply. I could have just gone to Spirit Halloween, bought a costume or a rubber mask, and went to Walmart for finishing touches and adjustments, and done a satisfactory job for under $200, but that’s not what I wanted. I wanted the rizz. I wanted to stand out among all the other costumed partygoers at the fraternity Halloween party. This costume absolutely did it, and I couldn’t have been happier.

In my ecstasy, I noticed a . . . feeling running through my body, as though there was a kind of . . . energy coursing through me. It wasn’t as simple as “a burning in my blood” or “my nerves were on fire”. No, it was a feeling of power, as though I was still myself, but also something . . . more.

I felt as though I could toss four men over my shoulders and run a marathon. I felt as though I could get in a bar fight and kick every ass in the place. I felt . . . godly.

I removed the mask after a few minutes and inspected my outfit without it. I felt normal again, and, somehow, it felt wrong. I felt like my ordinary self was somehow no longer enough. I felt incomplete, like I removed a piece of myself when I removed the mask.

“Stop being ridiculous,” I told my reflection. “You’re letting myth and superstition influence you. You’re better than that!”

And yet, I felt like I was lying to myself. Right there, staring at my reflection, I felt like the man looking back at me wasn’t really me, like something unknowable was missing. I looked at my reflection and it felt as though I was looking at someone else, someone I didn’t really know, and who could never truly know me in return.

I shook my head to clear the strange thoughts and center myself again. “Pictures!” I reminded myself. “Tiffany wanted pictures so she could put together something complementary.”

I took out my phone and held it up to the mirror to take a picture, and paused. I couldn’t send her a picture like this. My costume was incomplete. I needed to wear the mask or else my costume wasn’t really my costume, and how could she possibly match her costume to mine if I sent her an incomplete photo?

I picked up the mask to put it on and paused. I paused to look at it, to admire it. I looked into its lifelike glass eyes. I stroked its fur as though it were a living thing. “You’re mine,” I told it in a low, almost silent voice. “You’re mine, and I am your master!”

I continued to stare into those perfectly crafted glass eyes, losing myself in them, and wanting nothing in the world so much as I wanted to put that mask on and forget myself. Slowly, almost robotically, I raised it up and gently lowered it over my head.

I felt a rush of euphoria, like what I felt earlier only a hundred times more potent. I took my phone in hand, opened the camera app, raised it, and snapped a single picture of myself in the mirror.

I opened text messaging, selected Tiffany, attached the message, and typed the following text: “It’s complete, and now I’m complete.”

I hit send. I looked into the mirror and met my own gaze staring back at me through those glass eyes that had no business looking as real and alive as they did, and then the world went blank.

\*\*\*\*\*

I awoke the next day with no idea where I was. I opened my eyes only to be greeted by the rising sun in the middle of a forest.

A forest?

There was a forest outside of town, but it wasn’t exactly a short walk if you catch my drift.

It was easily a half an hour’s drive once you got out of town, and not exactly the kind of thing you just get up and walk to like you’re taking the dog out to the local community park.

I woke up there, and not on the edge either, but well inside the borders, and I was covered in a red, sticky substance that could only be blood, and my stomach hurt like I had gotten drunk and did my best to eat my own body weight at the local Asian buffet.

“What the . . .” I trailed off as I looked at my hands and arms and was taken aback by the dried red and brown goop covering them. I looked down at myself and saw that I was still in my costume, and my clothing was utterly ruined, covered in a deep red liquid that was surely blood.

I realized that I was still wearing the mask, and I ripped it off of my head in a panic. My breath came in great heaves, uncontrollable, and my head began to swim as I hyperventilated.

I closed my eyes and forced myself to calm down. I made myself breathe slower, and slower, and slower still until I finally brought it down to normal. I focused on my heart rate, and gradually brought it down with a blend of deep breathing and mind clearing.

Once I had myself physically under control, I looked at myself again.

How did I get covered in such a disgustingly massive amount of blood? Why did my stomach hurt so much? How did the wolf mask manage to stay clean when the rest of me was drenched in filth? And why did I-

My stomach finally gave up and rebelled. I dropped the wolf mask and fell to my knees retching and vomiting a copious amount of stomach contents. I vomited even as I found myself losing my breath and desperately wanting to breathe. I vomited even as my lack of breath began to make my head swim. I vomited even as my vision blurred and blackened at the edges.

Then I was able to breathe again. I took in great, gasping gulps of air. I I heaved and panted as I sought to restore my oxygen supply.

Then I vomited again.

If possible, I can say that the second round was worse than the third. It didn’t hit me so continuously as to cut me off from breathing completely like the first round did, but it did let me get just enough breath to barely subsist before striking again until I thought I would surely pass out, and then it subsided just long enough to tease me again before taking over and nearly choking me to death over and over and over again until I wished that I could just die and get it over with,

When I was finally finished, my stomach felt better, but there was glistening pile of partially digested stomach contents all over the ground in front of me. I wish I could say that I knew what I was looking at, but it was all so thoroughly masticated that I couldn’t hope pick one bit from another. All I knew was that none of it looked cooked, and I didn’t see anything that could pass for a vegetable anywhere in the nasty mix.

My stomach felt better though.

I picked up my mask, chose a random direction, and began to walk. I must have chosen well, because after only two hours, I came across a road.

I’m not ignorant. I’ve driven in and out of town plenty of times. I know my way around in town and around the outskirts of my hometown. That’s why I knew that I needed to go left once I reached this road if I wanted to get home. How long would it take? Fucked if I know. All that mattered was I was going the right direction, and the rest would fall into place one way or another.

And fall into place it did. Less than an hour of walking later, A random pickup truck pulled over. The driver listened to my story, and told me to hop in the bed of his truck and he’d take me into town. I did it gratefully, and he was as good as his word, better even. He dropped me off outside my apartment building, told me to stay off the drugs, and went on his merry way.

I went inside, took the elevator to my floor, opened my door without needing to use my key, which was also weird since I never, ever, EVER left my apartment without locking it, and immediately rushed to the shower so I could get clean and feel human again.

I was brushing my teeth for the third time when I heard my phone ringing. It was on the floor, pushed up against the wall under the sink. Why? I don’t know. But I found it, pulled it out, and answered the call.

“Where have you been?” Tiffany practically shrieked in my ear. I’ve been calling and texting all night and I haven’t heard a word from you! If you didn’t pick up the phone this time I was going to call the cops to make sure you weren’t dead!”

On the one hand, it felt surreal being yelled at so mundanely after the freaky mystery I woke up to. On the other, what in the ever-living hell was going on?

I let my girlfriend yell for awhile until she was all shouted out. Then I responded. “I don’t know where I was last night,” I told her in a shaky voice. “One minute I was home, the next I was waking up in the middle of nowhere covered in blood.”

This set off another wave of panicked screeching that eventually settled down into sobbing and expressions of gratitude that I was alright. She told me she was coming right over and hung up before I could protest.

I had a very, very bad feeling about her coming over.

\*\*\*\*\*

It literally took all day to get Tiffany settled down and comfortable with the fact that that, in spite of everything, I was alright. I didn’t tell her about how my body had violently purged my stomach of an inhuman amount of raw flesh shortly after waking up. I was already washed up, and my bloody costume was in the wash getting as clean as I could hope for it to be.

It was actually the laundry that got her settled down. She volunteered to take my costume out of the dryer, and was absolutely delighted to see that I had added to it by dying in a bunch of red and brown staining. “It’s actually looks like you ripped something apart and ate it!” she said excitedly. “You’re so good at making Halloween costumes!”

“Yeah . . .” I said slowly before trailing off. “I modified it . . .”

She didn’t give me a chance to finish my words or my thoughts before she jumped me. Perhaps if she hadn’t been so excited and relieved that I was safe and healthy, things would have turned out differently. Perhaps if our intimate life wasn’t so . . . frequent and vigorous, everything would have turned out differently.

As it was, I succumbed to her passion, and we fell asleep in each other’s arms for an afternoon nap.

\*\*\*\*\*

I awoke before Tiffany did, and I went to the living room to examine the mask. I felt scared holding it. It felt wrong to put my hands upon that artifact, as though I was touching a power I could not hope to control or comprehend.

I turned it over, and over, and over again, examining it to the finest detail.

Why did this mask, out of everything I wore last night, not have a single drop of blood on it? Why was the last thing I could remember putting it on and taking a selfie?

That thought triggered something in me, and I took out my phone. I didn’t have it with me in the forest, and I couldn’t remember checking the picture I took or sending it to Tiffany.

I opened the photos and looked at the last picture I took.

I don’t know what I was expecting. Maybe a photo of myself mid-metamorphosis. Mayne I thought I’d catch myself becoming something other than, well, me. What I actually saw was me, in my costume, with my phone in my hand.

I looked at the picture again, not really believing that it could be so mundane, and I thought I could see something . . . different in those lifelike glass eyes, I though that maybe, just maybe there was a hint of something in there that was not only me. But no. It couldn’t be. The supernatural isn’t real after all. It’s all hokum. Bunk. Small-minded garbage that enlightened people like me didn’t believe in.

The sun had set. It wasn’t down for long, but it was the second day of the rarest kind of blue moon event, the kind where the full moon happens two days in a row. I looked into the eyes of the mask, this perfect, masterfully crafted mask, lifted it up, and lowered it onto my head.

\*\*\*\*\*

I woke up the next morning, the nineteenth of October, a mere week ago to the most horrifying sight of my life.

I awoke on the floor of my own apartment, but once again, I was covered in blood and filth.

“How?” I screamed in horror, not understanding where the ungodly mess had come from.

My stomach was killing me. I rushed to my bathroom and barely made it to the toilet before my stomach decided to evacuate its contents, then and keep evacuating itself even when there was nothing but water and bile left to push out. It went on, and on, and on, until I wished I would just die rather than endure another moment of such violent illness.

I flushed the toilet whenever I had the presence of mind to do so without checking to see what had come out of me. I had seen what came out the day before, and I didn’t want to see it again. Perhaps that’s why I failed to recognize any of the bits and parts, the solid matter mixed in with the wretched fluids that erupted from my stomach and out of my mouth.

Regardless, I was glued to the toilet until my stomach finally settled down after who-knows how long. Then I stripped my bloody clothing and took a shower so hot I felt like it might burn the skin from my bones, and I was okay with that.

I felt dirty inside and out. It was wrong. Wrong in every way. Down to my soul if I had believed it at the time, I felt wrong, dirty, and thoroughly corrupted.

I was in the shower for an hour, lost in feelings rather than thought. Wondering what had happened and how I managed to wind up covered in blood again in my own apartment. It was only when I finally shut off the water and was halfway through drying off that it hit me.

Tiffany!”

I screamed, and I ran to my bedroom.

I burst into my bedroom, and was greeted by the most horrific mess I could possibly imagine. The entire room was splattered with blood and viscera. Not a surface was spared as at least some red drops or other . . . scraps was on every surface, every knick-knack, every everything in the room

My screams only got louder and more insistent as I scanned the room and found the head of Tifany, my beautiful Tiffany, beloved girlfriend of three years, on a pillow, fully detached from her body, lifeless eyes staring off into the void. I hurled myself to it, reaching desperately, not willing to believe in what I was seeing.

I picked it up and stared into her sightless eyes, and burst into tears. “Tiffany,” I sobbed. “How? Why?”

I looked around and took the horrific scene in. I recognized the various parts of my beloved scattered around the room. Legs and arms tossed about, bones scattered all over, looking like they had been gnawed upon by a great beast. And not one of her internal organs to be seen.

I remembered how upset my stomach was when I woke up, and how distended it appeared before I threw up the contents in a prolonged, and violent fit. How much of her had I simply flushed away, not knowing what I was doing because I refused to just open my eyes as I vomited up my sick?

I dropped Tiffany’s head back onto my bed and scrambled to the living room. I picked up the diary of Archibald Wembly and read it thoroughly. Much of it was a repeat of what I had already read before in the other provenance, until I got to the end. Here is what is read:

*I should have listened to the rules. I should have learned from the mistakes of others. I didn’t, and now I am paying the price for my foolishness. The mask is gone, but I can feel it’s influence on me even as I write these words.  I blacked out again last night, and when I awoke this morning, my family was dead, ripped apart from some foul beast. Every last one of them. My wife Abigail, and the children George, Franklin, Erin, and Caleb. All of them were torn apart. Only I was spared, and I was covered in such an amount of blood and gore that it could only have come from many animals, of a family of people. I ignored the rules. I wore the mask at night. I wore it on the full moon. It amused me to do so, and I did it without once invoking the name of Christ for protection.*

*I was a fool, and my family has paid the price for my pride and lack of faith. The mask is gone, but I can still feel it within me somehow, as though it has become a part of me. I do not know what the future will bring, but I fear it will be more bloodshed, and it will be me in some beastly form, rending apart my fellow man in bestial glee.*

*I only hope that someone stops me before I go too far.*

*God help me and spare the innocent.*

I put the diary down and sat back stunned, then it dawned on me: Where was the wolf mask?

I tore my apartment searching for it, I really did, but I could not find it. Still, I can feel its presence, like it’s lost, but also not. It’s like it’s here with me even though I cannot see it.

Today is only five days until Halloween. The sun has set, and I feel . . . strong, stronger than I have any right to feel. My dead girlfriend remains rotting in my bedroom, and it smells horrible. The neighbors are sure to complain soon.

I don’t understand what’s going on, but I do know this: I never should have bought that mask, and once I bought it, I never should have broken the rules. How was I supposed to know it was a real cursed object? There’s no science that can explain curses, real, magical curses. Magic isn’t real, right?

Who am I kidding. I believe in magic . . . now. But I came to believe too late. Too late to save my beloved Tiffany, and too late to save myself.

I need to flee. I need to get away from here, as soon as possible. I can feel the beast inside of me, and it wants to get out. I need to get as far away from people as possible, to disappear and never be seen again.

But I’m hungry, and there’s a great nightclub not far from here, and the night is young.

Perhaps I’ll stop in for a bite to eat before I begin my journey.",1,1729994534.0,LighthouseHorror,0,1.0,False

1gd0n4m,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1gd0n4m/the_mask_of_the_loup_garou/,The Mask of the Loup Garou,"I never should have entered that antique store, and I definitely shouldn’t have bought that mask. Gannon’s is known for buying and selling rare and unique antiques, and I wanted to impress my friends with a unique Halloween costume this year, so I thought the perfect solution would be to get my hands on a genuine antique costume, one of those strange, ultra creepy ones from the 1800’s or earlier. Sure, it would cost me, but can you really put a price on standing out?

The bell over the door jingled dully as I opened the door and walked in. The proprietor, and gray, bent over man with a thick, bushy beard and thick, round rimmed spectacles who was ninety if he was a day casually acknowledged me and went back to the ancient book he was examining.

The store wasn’t big, but it had space, only every last bit of that space was filled with relics of bygone eras. Not the usual furniture, silverware, and paintings of your typical antique shop. No. Everything here had a story, and as such, everything here commanded a premium price.

There was an old cavalry saber that was known to have killed no less than seven men in the Civil War. It even still had flecks of blood from its victims spattered along the blade and hilt. There was an old rope noose that had supposedly been used to hang a witch during the Salem Witch Trials. There was an ancient tome with strange symbols on the cover that once belonged to a European court wizard. There was even a hat that once belonged to a certain H. H. Holmes. The stories attached to each item were historical, mystical, and often macabre. And I loved it.

I didn’t believe in magic or mysticism, angels and demons, or anything else beyond what science could explain. That didn’t mean that I wasn’t fascinated by stories involving them though. How much more interesting would the world be if the supernatural actually did exist? It was a tantalizing proposition, and it’s why I had to buy it as soon as I saw it.

It was a wolf mask. Not a mask made to look like a wolf, but a mask made out of the skin and fur of a wolf’s head and neck. It was a masterful work of preservation and artistry that looked as alive on display that day as the creature itself must have looked in life.

I picked it up carefully, turning it over and around in my hand so I could see it from every angle. The work was beyond fine. I couldn’t even see the seams and threads that held it together. Not a single hair seemed to be missing from the thick, gray fur. The teeth were real, and firmly fixed into the snout. I assumed they were so well-done because the original jaws had been used to form the snarling mouth. The eyes were glass, and far too lifelike for such an aged item. Perfect replicas of thin glass set in the eye sockets.

I had to have it.

I checked the story card next to the original display. The price was outrageous, but I didn’t care. Not only was the mask perfect, but the supposed history couldn’t have been more ideal for the season.

It read simply: *Enchanted mask made from the preserved skin of a Loup Garou slain in Burgundy, France in 1137 AD. Do not wear at night.*

“Oh hohohoho,” I grunted excitedly. “I have plans for you!”

I brought the mask and story card to the checkout. Old man Gannon checked the item, and me with more scrutiny than I was really comfortable with before speaking. “Heed the warning boy,” he said sternly. “It wouldn’t do for you to tempt fate.”

I chuckled, ignoring the fact that he called me “boy”. He was probably the oldest man in town, so everyone was “boy” or “girl” to him. “You don’t have to worry about me,” I assured him. “You got any more documentation that goes with this? If I’m going to fork over two-thousand dollars for a mask, I want as much provenance as I can get.”

Old man Gannon grunted derisively. “Of course I have documents that go with it. A fair few actually. Be sure that you read them and take proper precautions.”

“Of course,” I replied seriously, lying through my teeth. The supernatural is not real after all. It’s a myth, legend, just stories. What this mask was, to me, was the foundation of the absolute best Halloween costume I had ever concocted. Sure, a werewolf costume wouldn’t be especially unique, but with that mask, it would be the most frighteningly real one our town had ever seen.

The old man went into the back room and quickly returned with a binder filled with documents in protectors, and a small leatherbound journal. “These are the provenance,” he declared. “The journal is of particular interest as it belonged to a previous owner of the mask, a Mr. Archibald Wembly of London, wrote it in the years Fifteen-Twelve through Fifteen-Fourteen. He went mad after wearing the mask and killed two people before he was cut down in the street. Witnesses swore that he looked more animal than man before he died. The police report is document one-hundred-twenty-three.”

I set the mask on the counter and quickly leafed through the documents. There were originals, and English translations for each. “All this and you’re only charging two-thousand dollars?” I asked incredulously. “Such a unique relic with this much provenance together . . . it has to be worth more.”

Old man Gannon nodded his head. “Yes. Yes it is,” he confirmed. “I actually paid more for it myself, but . . .” he trailed off. “Something about that particular item unsettles me. I wish to be rid of it sooner rather than later, so I’m taking a loss for my own peace of mind.”

I didn’t question it. If this old man was willing to let his superstitions be my gain, I was perfectly fine with it. I paid for the mask and happily took it home.

Looking back, I should never have been so sure of myself. Nor so proud. Nor so certain about how the world works. The events that followed changed my perspective of the nature of reality itself, and I don’t think I’ll ever be able to go back to how I was.

In my defense, and also to remove any possibility that I can claim ignorance if I get desperate enough, I need to confess that I did read the provenance documents right away. I didn’t read them to get any warnings to heed, or as some kind of user manual. I read them to learn the history of my beautiful, terrifyingly creepy wolf mask. Having the story at the tip of my tongue top tell at will would truly be the icing on what I knew would be a most impressive, and frightening cake, or, rather, costume.

The earliest documents were all about the supposed Loup Garou that was terrorizing the Burgundian countryside, and the hunt to put an end to the gruesome string of murders it was blamed for. Document twenty was a notice celebrating that the foul beast had finally been killed and skinned by a visiting huntsman who only asked to be allowed to keep the skin and take it back to him home as his reward. The local ruler, only too happy to get off so cheaply, permitted it.

The huntsman wrote that he brought the hide to a supposed witch named Lucia, who lived alone on a mountain named Muzsla in modern day Slovakia. He paid her handsomely with instructions to use the hide to create an item of power. One that would make him strong.

Apparently, she obliged, making the wolf mask, and he was happy, but it came with a strict set of rules. 1. Never wear the mask at night. 2. Never wear the mask on the day or night of the full moon. 3. Never wear the mask during the autumnal equinox. 4. Always invoke the name of Christ before donning the mask.

The man must have been wildly superstitious, because he followed the rules religiously. The following documents are filled with fanciful tales of the huntsman performing mighty deeds that led to him earning a minor lordship before retiring to administer his land holdings and eventually dying of old age.

What followed after was one document after another that spoke of the mask passing to a new owner who either did not read, or chose not to follow the rules, and how each one ultimately went mad, committing a varying number of murders, and being either killed during the apprehension, or executed for their crimes. It gained a reputation as a cursed item that turned men into mindless beasts and drove them to kill and even cannibalize their victims.

“Holy crap!” I exclaimed as I finished reading the last page in the binder. “This is even better than I thought! I wonder what that Wembly guy wrote in his diary!”

It was getting late, so I decided to put off reading the diary for another day. I picked up my mask and looked it over, admiring it for both its craftsmanship and its history. “You just might be the coolest thing I’ll ever own,” I said to it as I caressed its cheek.

I looked into the glass eyes, and maybe it was a trick of the light, or maybe it was the lateness of the hour playing tricks with my mind, but I could have sworn those eyes, those glass eyes, looked back at me.

\*\*\*\*

I awoke the next morning to my girlfriend letting herself into my apartment. Her key clicked in the lock, and the door squeaked noisily as she opened it.

“Wake up sleepyhead!” she called.

I sat up and groaned in response as I rubbed the sleep out of my eyes. I checked the clock on my nightstand, saw the time, and got annoyed. “It’s seven a.m. on a Saturday!”

“We have plan’s remember?” she called out. “We’re supposed to . . . what is this?” she asked. Her tone changed from businesslike to pure excitement.

I stepped out of my bedroom clad in nothing but my night pants. She was excitedly holding up the wolf mask and admiring it. “It’s a cursed wolf mask,” I replied with a yawn. “It’s the centerpiece of my Halloween costume this year.”

“It’s looks so real,” she said admiringly, then her expression darkened and she put the mask down on the table. “Did you say ‘cursed’?” she sharply inquired.

“Yeah,” I yawned again. “It’s almost a thousand years old. The documents it came with say that a bunch of its previous owners went psycho and started killing people.”

“And you bought it?” she practically shrieked. “And you’re going to wear it?”

I filled the coffee maker and turned it on. “Don’t tell me you believe in magic, voodoo, curses, and all that nonsense,” I replied tiredly.

She took pause at that. I knew her answer, it was a major point of agreement between us. What science can’t explain either isn’t real, or just hasn’t been properly explained yet. Nothing is supernatural.

She finally replied. It’s just . . .” she paused. “If a bunch of people who owned it really did turn into psycho killers, there’s gotta be something there.”

I poured a cup of black coffee from the still brewing pot and took a sip. It was too hot but I didn’t care. “Sure there is,” I replied. “Social contagion. People believe it’s cursed, so they respond as though it’s cursed. It’s nothing special.”

It must have made sense to her, because he whole attitude changed again. “Have you tried it on yet?” she asked with a slight smile, her fear replaced with the admiration and curiosity she had when she first laid eyes on the mask.

It struck me that I hadn’t, so I picked it up, looked my girlfriend in the eyes, said “Jesus Christ” in a mocking tone, and put it on. It felt . . . perfect, as though it were made just for me. It slipped over my head easily and seemed to snug down to a perfect form fit. It had no odor, and I could see clearly with a full field of view through the glass eyes. “Not until just now,” I replied teasingly.

“EEEEK!” she shrieked.

“What?” I asked, alarmed, turning my head rapidly to see what had so alarmed her.

“The mouth moved when you talked!” she squealed. “It moved, and it moved in a perfect match for your words!”

I cocked my head to the side and looked at her quizzically. “For real?” I asked. It’s moving with my mouth?”

“Yes!’ she said excitedly. “Go see in the mirror!”

I did. I spoke. “Abracadabra, hocus pokus, jiggedy jokeus!” I said to my reflection.

Sure enough, the mouth moved in a lupine imitation of my own mouth movements. The movement were so well synced that I could swear I even saw the lips move although I knew it to be impossible. I took the mask off and admired it with the fattest grin of all time on my face.

“That’s amazing!” I exclaimed. “That old witch was a real master! I didn’t know people even knew how to make a mask’s mouth move in the twelfth century!?

“I know right?” My girlfriend, Tiffany said with as much excitement as I felt. “You’re going to have an amazing Halloween costume this year!”

I removed the mask, smiled at her, an nodded my head in affirmation.

“Just one thing,” she said with a hint of confusion. “What’s with that thing you said before you put the mask on?”

It took me a moment to remember what she was talking about. “Oh!” I snapped my fingers as I remembered. “There was a silly little list of rules, I was mocking them.” I grabbed the folder of provenance and flipped to the page with the rules on it. “See?” I said, pointing at the small passage. “Four ridiculous rules.”

Tiffany read them quickly and looked at me with a touch of confusion. “People actually believed this crap?” she said incredulously.

“I know, right?” I laughed.

She laughed with me for a bit, then stopped suddenly and glared at me. “Wait a minute,” she said sternly. “How much did you pay for this mask anyway?”

\*\*\*\*\*

The next few days were perfectly ordinary until the seventeenth. That was the day I finished assembling my costume, and one of two full moons in a row this year. I remember bringing home a pair of retro ripped jeans to go with the red plaid flannel shirt, theater prop quality werewolf gloves, complete with a set of long claws tipping the fingers, and other clothing reminiscent of an 80’s era movie werewolf.

The sun had set hours earlier. I obtained the pants shopping with Tiffany after our dinner date, and I was absolutely thrilled. I couldn’t wait to try it all on and see how it went together.

It was glorious. I donned the outfit, then slowly, almost ritualistically lowered the mask over my head to complete the costume.

It was like magic in the mirror. I looked myself over, and I loved what I saw. I looked like something out of Teen Wolf, only better. Sure, I could have achieved something very much like it far more cheaply. I could have just gone to Spirit Halloween, bought a costume or a rubber mask, and went to Walmart for finishing touches and adjustments, and done a satisfactory job for under $200, but that’s not what I wanted. I wanted the rizz. I wanted to stand out among all the other costumed partygoers at the fraternity Halloween party. This costume absolutely did it, and I couldn’t have been happier.

In my ecstasy, I noticed a . . . feeling running through my body, as though there was a kind of . . . energy coursing through me. It wasn’t as simple as “a burning in my blood” or “my nerves were on fire”. No, it was a feeling of power, as though I was still myself, but also something . . . more.

I felt as though I could toss four men over my shoulders and run a marathon. I felt as though I could get in a bar fight and kick every ass in the place. I felt . . . godly.

I removed the mask after a few minutes and inspected my outfit without it. I felt normal again, and, somehow, it felt wrong. I felt like my ordinary self was somehow no longer enough. I felt incomplete, like I removed a piece of myself when I removed the mask.

“Stop being ridiculous,” I told my reflection. “You’re letting myth and superstition influence you. You’re better than that!”

And yet, I felt like I was lying to myself. Right there, staring at my reflection, I felt like the man looking back at me wasn’t really me, like something unknowable was missing. I looked at my reflection and it felt as though I was looking at someone else, someone I didn’t really know, and who could never truly know me in return.

I shook my head to clear the strange thoughts and center myself again. “Pictures!” I reminded myself. “Tiffany wanted pictures so she could put together something complementary.”

I took out my phone and held it up to the mirror to take a picture, and paused. I couldn’t send her a picture like this. My costume was incomplete. I needed to wear the mask or else my costume wasn’t really my costume, and how could she possibly match her costume to mine if I sent her an incomplete photo?

I picked up the mask to put it on and paused. I paused to look at it, to admire it. I looked into its lifelike glass eyes. I stroked its fur as though it were a living thing. “You’re mine,” I told it in a low, almost silent voice. “You’re mine, and I am your master!”

I continued to stare into those perfectly crafted glass eyes, losing myself in them, and wanting nothing in the world so much as I wanted to put that mask on and forget myself. Slowly, almost robotically, I raised it up and gently lowered it over my head.

I felt a rush of euphoria, like what I felt earlier only a hundred times more potent. I took my phone in hand, opened the camera app, raised it, and snapped a single picture of myself in the mirror.

I opened text messaging, selected Tiffany, attached the message, and typed the following text: “It’s complete, and now I’m complete.”

I hit send. I looked into the mirror and met my own gaze staring back at me through those glass eyes that had no business looking as real and alive as they did, and then the world went blank.

\*\*\*\*\*

I awoke the next day with no idea where I was. I opened my eyes only to be greeted by the rising sun in the middle of a forest.

A forest?

There was a forest outside of town, but it wasn’t exactly a short walk if you catch my drift.

It was easily a half an hour’s drive once you got out of town, and not exactly the kind of thing you just get up and walk to like you’re taking the dog out to the local community park.

I woke up there, and not on the edge either, but well inside the borders, and I was covered in a red, sticky substance that could only be blood, and my stomach hurt like I had gotten drunk and did my best to eat my own body weight at the local Asian buffet.

“What the . . .” I trailed off as I looked at my hands and arms and was taken aback by the dried red and brown goop covering them. I looked down at myself and saw that I was still in my costume, and my clothing was utterly ruined, covered in a deep red liquid that was surely blood.

I realized that I was still wearing the mask, and I ripped it off of my head in a panic. My breath came in great heaves, uncontrollable, and my head began to swim as I hyperventilated.

I closed my eyes and forced myself to calm down. I made myself breathe slower, and slower, and slower still until I finally brought it down to normal. I focused on my heart rate, and gradually brought it down with a blend of deep breathing and mind clearing.

Once I had myself physically under control, I looked at myself again.

How did I get covered in such a disgustingly massive amount of blood? Why did my stomach hurt so much? How did the wolf mask manage to stay clean when the rest of me was drenched in filth? And why did I-

My stomach finally gave up and rebelled. I dropped the wolf mask and fell to my knees retching and vomiting a copious amount of stomach contents. I vomited even as I found myself losing my breath and desperately wanting to breathe. I vomited even as my lack of breath began to make my head swim. I vomited even as my vision blurred and blackened at the edges.

Then I was able to breathe again. I took in great, gasping gulps of air. I I heaved and panted as I sought to restore my oxygen supply.

Then I vomited again.

If possible, I can say that the second round was worse than the third. It didn’t hit me so continuously as to cut me off from breathing completely like the first round did, but it did let me get just enough breath to barely subsist before striking again until I thought I would surely pass out, and then it subsided just long enough to tease me again before taking over and nearly choking me to death over and over and over again until I wished that I could just die and get it over with,

When I was finally finished, my stomach felt better, but there was glistening pile of partially digested stomach contents all over the ground in front of me. I wish I could say that I knew what I was looking at, but it was all so thoroughly masticated that I couldn’t hope pick one bit from another. All I knew was that none of it looked cooked, and I didn’t see anything that could pass for a vegetable anywhere in the nasty mix.

My stomach felt better though.

I picked up my mask, chose a random direction, and began to walk. I must have chosen well, because after only two hours, I came across a road.

I’m not ignorant. I’ve driven in and out of town plenty of times. I know my way around in town and around the outskirts of my hometown. That’s why I knew that I needed to go left once I reached this road if I wanted to get home. How long would it take? Fucked if I know. All that mattered was I was going the right direction, and the rest would fall into place one way or another.

And fall into place it did. Less than an hour of walking later, A random pickup truck pulled over. The driver listened to my story, and told me to hop in the bed of his truck and he’d take me into town. I did it gratefully, and he was as good as his word, better even. He dropped me off outside my apartment building, told me to stay off the drugs, and went on his merry way.

I went inside, took the elevator to my floor, opened my door without needing to use my key, which was also weird since I never, ever, EVER left my apartment without locking it, and immediately rushed to the shower so I could get clean and feel human again.

I was brushing my teeth for the third time when I heard my phone ringing. It was on the floor, pushed up against the wall under the sink. Why? I don’t know. But I found it, pulled it out, and answered the call.

“Where have you been?” Tiffany practically shrieked in my ear. I’ve been calling and texting all night and I haven’t heard a word from you! If you didn’t pick up the phone this time I was going to call the cops to make sure you weren’t dead!”

On the one hand, it felt surreal being yelled at so mundanely after the freaky mystery I woke up to. On the other, what in the ever-living hell was going on?

I let my girlfriend yell for awhile until she was all shouted out. Then I responded. “I don’t know where I was last night,” I told her in a shaky voice. “One minute I was home, the next I was waking up in the middle of nowhere covered in blood.”

This set off another wave of panicked screeching that eventually settled down into sobbing and expressions of gratitude that I was alright. She told me she was coming right over and hung up before I could protest.

I had a very, very bad feeling about her coming over.

\*\*\*\*\*

It literally took all day to get Tiffany settled down and comfortable with the fact that that, in spite of everything, I was alright. I didn’t tell her about how my body had violently purged my stomach of an inhuman amount of raw flesh shortly after waking up. I was already washed up, and my bloody costume was in the wash getting as clean as I could hope for it to be.

It was actually the laundry that got her settled down. She volunteered to take my costume out of the dryer, and was absolutely delighted to see that I had added to it by dying in a bunch of red and brown staining. “It’s actually looks like you ripped something apart and ate it!” she said excitedly. “You’re so good at making Halloween costumes!”

“Yeah . . .” I said slowly before trailing off. “I modified it . . .”

She didn’t give me a chance to finish my words or my thoughts before she jumped me. Perhaps if she hadn’t been so excited and relieved that I was safe and healthy, things would have turned out differently. Perhaps if our intimate life wasn’t so . . . frequent and vigorous, everything would have turned out differently.

As it was, I succumbed to her passion, and we fell asleep in each other’s arms for an afternoon nap.

\*\*\*\*\*

I awoke before Tiffany did, and I went to the living room to examine the mask. I felt scared holding it. It felt wrong to put my hands upon that artifact, as though I was touching a power I could not hope to control or comprehend.

I turned it over, and over, and over again, examining it to the finest detail.

Why did this mask, out of everything I wore last night, not have a single drop of blood on it? Why was the last thing I could remember putting it on and taking a selfie?

That thought triggered something in me, and I took out my phone. I didn’t have it with me in the forest, and I couldn’t remember checking the picture I took or sending it to Tiffany.

I opened the photos and looked at the last picture I took.

I don’t know what I was expecting. Maybe a photo of myself mid-metamorphosis. Mayne I thought I’d catch myself becoming something other than, well, me. What I actually saw was me, in my costume, with my phone in my hand.

I looked at the picture again, not really believing that it could be so mundane, and I thought I could see something . . . different in those lifelike glass eyes, I though that maybe, just maybe there was a hint of something in there that was not only me. But no. It couldn’t be. The supernatural isn’t real after all. It’s all hokum. Bunk. Small-minded garbage that enlightened people like me didn’t believe in.

The sun had set. It wasn’t down for long, but it was the second day of the rarest kind of blue moon event, the kind where the full moon happens two days in a row. I looked into the eyes of the mask, this perfect, masterfully crafted mask, lifted it up, and lowered it onto my head.

\*\*\*\*\*

I woke up the next morning, the nineteenth of October, a mere week ago to the most horrifying sight of my life.

I awoke on the floor of my own apartment, but once again, I was covered in blood and filth.

“How?” I screamed in horror, not understanding where the ungodly mess had come from.

My stomach was killing me. I rushed to my bathroom and barely made it to the toilet before my stomach decided to evacuate its contents, then and keep evacuating itself even when there was nothing but water and bile left to push out. It went on, and on, and on, until I wished I would just die rather than endure another moment of such violent illness.

I flushed the toilet whenever I had the presence of mind to do so without checking to see what had come out of me. I had seen what came out the day before, and I didn’t want to see it again. Perhaps that’s why I failed to recognize any of the bits and parts, the solid matter mixed in with the wretched fluids that erupted from my stomach and out of my mouth.

Regardless, I was glued to the toilet until my stomach finally settled down after who-knows how long. Then I stripped my bloody clothing and took a shower so hot I felt like it might burn the skin from my bones, and I was okay with that.

I felt dirty inside and out. It was wrong. Wrong in every way. Down to my soul if I had believed it at the time, I felt wrong, dirty, and thoroughly corrupted.

I was in the shower for an hour, lost in feelings rather than thought. Wondering what had happened and how I managed to wind up covered in blood again in my own apartment. It was only when I finally shut off the water and was halfway through drying off that it hit me.

Tiffany!”

I screamed, and I ran to my bedroom.

I burst into my bedroom, and was greeted by the most horrific mess I could possibly imagine. The entire room was splattered with blood and viscera. Not a surface was spared as at least some red drops or other . . . scraps was on every surface, every knick-knack, every everything in the room

My screams only got louder and more insistent as I scanned the room and found the head of Tifany, my beautiful Tiffany, beloved girlfriend of three years, on a pillow, fully detached from her body, lifeless eyes staring off into the void. I hurled myself to it, reaching desperately, not willing to believe in what I was seeing.

I picked it up and stared into her sightless eyes, and burst into tears. “Tiffany,” I sobbed. “How? Why?”

I looked around and took the horrific scene in. I recognized the various parts of my beloved scattered around the room. Legs and arms tossed about, bones scattered all over, looking like they had been gnawed upon by a great beast. And not one of her internal organs to be seen.

I remembered how upset my stomach was when I woke up, and how distended it appeared before I threw up the contents in a prolonged, and violent fit. How much of her had I simply flushed away, not knowing what I was doing because I refused to just open my eyes as I vomited up my sick?

I dropped Tiffany’s head back onto my bed and scrambled to the living room. I picked up the diary of Archibald Wembly and read it thoroughly. Much of it was a repeat of what I had already read before in the other provenance, until I got to the end. Here is what is read:

*I should have listened to the rules. I should have learned from the mistakes of others. I didn’t, and now I am paying the price for my foolishness. The mask is gone, but I can feel it’s influence on me even as I write these words.  I blacked out again last night, and when I awoke this morning, my family was dead, ripped apart from some foul beast. Every last one of them. My wife Abigail, and the children George, Franklin, Erin, and Caleb. All of them were torn apart. Only I was spared, and I was covered in such an amount of blood and gore that it could only have come from many animals, of a family of people. I ignored the rules. I wore the mask at night. I wore it on the full moon. It amused me to do so, and I did it without once invoking the name of Christ for protection.*

*I was a fool, and my family has paid the price for my pride and lack of faith. The mask is gone, but I can still feel it within me somehow, as though it has become a part of me. I do not know what the future will bring, but I fear it will be more bloodshed, and it will be me in some beastly form, rending apart my fellow man in bestial glee.*

*I only hope that someone stops me before I go too far.*

*God help me and spare the innocent.*

I put the diary down and sat back stunned, then it dawned on me: Where was the wolf mask?

I tore my apartment searching for it, I really did, but I could not find it. Still, I can feel its presence, like it’s lost, but also not. It’s like it’s here with me even though I cannot see it.

Today is only five days until Halloween. The sun has set, and I feel . . . strong, stronger than I have any right to feel. My dead girlfriend remains rotting in my bedroom, and it smells horrible. The neighbors are sure to complain soon.

I don’t understand what’s going on, but I do know this: I never should have bought that mask, and once I bought it, I never should have broken the rules. How was I supposed to know it was a real cursed object? There’s no science that can explain curses, real, magical curses. Magic isn’t real, right?

Who am I kidding. I believe in magic . . . now. But I came to believe too late. Too late to save my beloved Tiffany, and too late to save myself.

I need to flee. I need to get away from here, as soon as possible. I can feel the beast inside of me, and it wants to get out. I need to get as far away from people as possible, to disappear and never be seen again.

But I’m hungry, and there’s a great nightclub not far from here, and the night is young.

Perhaps I’ll stop in for a bite to eat before I begin my journey.",1,1729994496.0,libraryofshadows,0,1.0,False
1gd0msv,https://www.reddit.com/r/JordanGrupeHorror/comments/1gd0msv/the_mask_of_the_loup_garou/,The Mask of the Loup Garou,"I never should have entered that antique store, and I definitely shouldn’t have bought that mask. Gannon’s is known for buying and selling rare and unique antiques, and I wanted to impress my friends with a unique Halloween costume this year, so I thought the perfect solution would be to get my hands on a genuine antique costume, one of those strange, ultra creepy ones from the 1800’s or earlier. Sure, it would cost me, but can you really put a price on standing out?

The bell over the door jingled dully as I opened the door and walked in. The proprietor, and gray, bent over man with a thick, bushy beard and thick, round rimmed spectacles who was ninety if he was a day casually acknowledged me and went back to the ancient book he was examining.

The store wasn’t big, but it had space, only every last bit of that space was filled with relics of bygone eras. Not the usual furniture, silverware, and paintings of your typical antique shop. No. Everything here had a story, and as such, everything here commanded a premium price.

There was an old cavalry saber that was known to have killed no less than seven men in the Civil War. It even still had flecks of blood from its victims spattered along the blade and hilt. There was an old rope noose that had supposedly been used to hang a witch during the Salem Witch Trials. There was an ancient tome with strange symbols on the cover that once belonged to a European court wizard. There was even a hat that once belonged to a certain H. H. Holmes. The stories attached to each item were historical, mystical, and often macabre. And I loved it.

I didn’t believe in magic or mysticism, angels and demons, or anything else beyond what science could explain. That didn’t mean that I wasn’t fascinated by stories involving them though. How much more interesting would the world be if the supernatural actually did exist? It was a tantalizing proposition, and it’s why I had to buy it as soon as I saw it.

It was a wolf mask. Not a mask made to look like a wolf, but a mask made out of the skin and fur of a wolf’s head and neck. It was a masterful work of preservation and artistry that looked as alive on display that day as the creature itself must have looked in life.

I picked it up carefully, turning it over and around in my hand so I could see it from every angle. The work was beyond fine. I couldn’t even see the seams and threads that held it together. Not a single hair seemed to be missing from the thick, gray fur. The teeth were real, and firmly fixed into the snout. I assumed they were so well-done because the original jaws had been used to form the snarling mouth. The eyes were glass, and far too lifelike for such an aged item. Perfect replicas of thin glass set in the eye sockets.

I had to have it.

I checked the story card next to the original display. The price was outrageous, but I didn’t care. Not only was the mask perfect, but the supposed history couldn’t have been more ideal for the season.

It read simply: *Enchanted mask made from the preserved skin of a Loup Garou slain in Burgundy, France in 1137 AD. Do not wear at night.*

“Oh hohohoho,” I grunted excitedly. “I have plans for you!”

I brought the mask and story card to the checkout. Old man Gannon checked the item, and me with more scrutiny than I was really comfortable with before speaking. “Heed the warning boy,” he said sternly. “It wouldn’t do for you to tempt fate.”

I chuckled, ignoring the fact that he called me “boy”. He was probably the oldest man in town, so everyone was “boy” or “girl” to him. “You don’t have to worry about me,” I assured him. “You got any more documentation that goes with this? If I’m going to fork over two-thousand dollars for a mask, I want as much provenance as I can get.”

Old man Gannon grunted derisively. “Of course I have documents that go with it. A fair few actually. Be sure that you read them and take proper precautions.”

“Of course,” I replied seriously, lying through my teeth. The supernatural is not real after all. It’s a myth, legend, just stories. What this mask was, to me, was the foundation of the absolute best Halloween costume I had ever concocted. Sure, a werewolf costume wouldn’t be especially unique, but with that mask, it would be the most frighteningly real one our town had ever seen.

The old man went into the back room and quickly returned with a binder filled with documents in protectors, and a small leatherbound journal. “These are the provenance,” he declared. “The journal is of particular interest as it belonged to a previous owner of the mask, a Mr. Archibald Wembly of London, wrote it in the years Fifteen-Twelve through Fifteen-Fourteen. He went mad after wearing the mask and killed two people before he was cut down in the street. Witnesses swore that he looked more animal than man before he died. The police report is document one-hundred-twenty-three.”

I set the mask on the counter and quickly leafed through the documents. There were originals, and English translations for each. “All this and you’re only charging two-thousand dollars?” I asked incredulously. “Such a unique relic with this much provenance together . . . it has to be worth more.”

Old man Gannon nodded his head. “Yes. Yes it is,” he confirmed. “I actually paid more for it myself, but . . .” he trailed off. “Something about that particular item unsettles me. I wish to be rid of it sooner rather than later, so I’m taking a loss for my own peace of mind.”

I didn’t question it. If this old man was willing to let his superstitions be my gain, I was perfectly fine with it. I paid for the mask and happily took it home.

Looking back, I should never have been so sure of myself. Nor so proud. Nor so certain about how the world works. The events that followed changed my perspective of the nature of reality itself, and I don’t think I’ll ever be able to go back to how I was.

In my defense, and also to remove any possibility that I can claim ignorance if I get desperate enough, I need to confess that I did read the provenance documents right away. I didn’t read them to get any warnings to heed, or as some kind of user manual. I read them to learn the history of my beautiful, terrifyingly creepy wolf mask. Having the story at the tip of my tongue top tell at will would truly be the icing on what I knew would be a most impressive, and frightening cake, or, rather, costume.

The earliest documents were all about the supposed Loup Garou that was terrorizing the Burgundian countryside, and the hunt to put an end to the gruesome string of murders it was blamed for. Document twenty was a notice celebrating that the foul beast had finally been killed and skinned by a visiting huntsman who only asked to be allowed to keep the skin and take it back to him home as his reward. The local ruler, only too happy to get off so cheaply, permitted it.

The huntsman wrote that he brought the hide to a supposed witch named Lucia, who lived alone on a mountain named Muzsla in modern day Slovakia. He paid her handsomely with instructions to use the hide to create an item of power. One that would make him strong.

Apparently, she obliged, making the wolf mask, and he was happy, but it came with a strict set of rules. 1. Never wear the mask at night. 2. Never wear the mask on the day or night of the full moon. 3. Never wear the mask during the autumnal equinox. 4. Always invoke the name of Christ before donning the mask.

The man must have been wildly superstitious, because he followed the rules religiously. The following documents are filled with fanciful tales of the huntsman performing mighty deeds that led to him earning a minor lordship before retiring to administer his land holdings and eventually dying of old age.

What followed after was one document after another that spoke of the mask passing to a new owner who either did not read, or chose not to follow the rules, and how each one ultimately went mad, committing a varying number of murders, and being either killed during the apprehension, or executed for their crimes. It gained a reputation as a cursed item that turned men into mindless beasts and drove them to kill and even cannibalize their victims.

“Holy crap!” I exclaimed as I finished reading the last page in the binder. “This is even better than I thought! I wonder what that Wembly guy wrote in his diary!”

It was getting late, so I decided to put off reading the diary for another day. I picked up my mask and looked it over, admiring it for both its craftsmanship and its history. “You just might be the coolest thing I’ll ever own,” I said to it as I caressed its cheek.

I looked into the glass eyes, and maybe it was a trick of the light, or maybe it was the lateness of the hour playing tricks with my mind, but I could have sworn those eyes, those glass eyes, looked back at me.

\*\*\*\*

I awoke the next morning to my girlfriend letting herself into my apartment. Her key clicked in the lock, and the door squeaked noisily as she opened it.

“Wake up sleepyhead!” she called.

I sat up and groaned in response as I rubbed the sleep out of my eyes. I checked the clock on my nightstand, saw the time, and got annoyed. “It’s seven a.m. on a Saturday!”

“We have plan’s remember?” she called out. “We’re supposed to . . . what is this?” she asked. Her tone changed from businesslike to pure excitement.

I stepped out of my bedroom clad in nothing but my night pants. She was excitedly holding up the wolf mask and admiring it. “It’s a cursed wolf mask,” I replied with a yawn. “It’s the centerpiece of my Halloween costume this year.”

“It’s looks so real,” she said admiringly, then her expression darkened and she put the mask down on the table. “Did you say ‘cursed’?” she sharply inquired.

“Yeah,” I yawned again. “It’s almost a thousand years old. The documents it came with say that a bunch of its previous owners went psycho and started killing people.”

“And you bought it?” she practically shrieked. “And you’re going to wear it?”

I filled the coffee maker and turned it on. “Don’t tell me you believe in magic, voodoo, curses, and all that nonsense,” I replied tiredly.

She took pause at that. I knew her answer, it was a major point of agreement between us. What science can’t explain either isn’t real, or just hasn’t been properly explained yet. Nothing is supernatural.

She finally replied. It’s just . . .” she paused. “If a bunch of people who owned it really did turn into psycho killers, there’s gotta be something there.”

I poured a cup of black coffee from the still brewing pot and took a sip. It was too hot but I didn’t care. “Sure there is,” I replied. “Social contagion. People believe it’s cursed, so they respond as though it’s cursed. It’s nothing special.”

It must have made sense to her, because he whole attitude changed again. “Have you tried it on yet?” she asked with a slight smile, her fear replaced with the admiration and curiosity she had when she first laid eyes on the mask.

It struck me that I hadn’t, so I picked it up, looked my girlfriend in the eyes, said “Jesus Christ” in a mocking tone, and put it on. It felt . . . perfect, as though it were made just for me. It slipped over my head easily and seemed to snug down to a perfect form fit. It had no odor, and I could see clearly with a full field of view through the glass eyes. “Not until just now,” I replied teasingly.

“EEEEK!” she shrieked.

“What?” I asked, alarmed, turning my head rapidly to see what had so alarmed her.

“The mouth moved when you talked!” she squealed. “It moved, and it moved in a perfect match for your words!”

I cocked my head to the side and looked at her quizzically. “For real?” I asked. It’s moving with my mouth?”

“Yes!’ she said excitedly. “Go see in the mirror!”

I did. I spoke. “Abracadabra, hocus pokus, jiggedy jokeus!” I said to my reflection.

Sure enough, the mouth moved in a lupine imitation of my own mouth movements. The movement were so well synced that I could swear I even saw the lips move although I knew it to be impossible. I took the mask off and admired it with the fattest grin of all time on my face.

“That’s amazing!” I exclaimed. “That old witch was a real master! I didn’t know people even knew how to make a mask’s mouth move in the twelfth century!?

“I know right?” My girlfriend, Tiffany said with as much excitement as I felt. “You’re going to have an amazing Halloween costume this year!”

I removed the mask, smiled at her, an nodded my head in affirmation.

“Just one thing,” she said with a hint of confusion. “What’s with that thing you said before you put the mask on?”

It took me a moment to remember what she was talking about. “Oh!” I snapped my fingers as I remembered. “There was a silly little list of rules, I was mocking them.” I grabbed the folder of provenance and flipped to the page with the rules on it. “See?” I said, pointing at the small passage. “Four ridiculous rules.”

Tiffany read them quickly and looked at me with a touch of confusion. “People actually believed this crap?” she said incredulously.

“I know, right?” I laughed.

She laughed with me for a bit, then stopped suddenly and glared at me. “Wait a minute,” she said sternly. “How much did you pay for this mask anyway?”

\*\*\*\*\*

The next few days were perfectly ordinary until the seventeenth. That was the day I finished assembling my costume, and one of two full moons in a row this year. I remember bringing home a pair of retro ripped jeans to go with the red plaid flannel shirt, theater prop quality werewolf gloves, complete with a set of long claws tipping the fingers, and other clothing reminiscent of an 80’s era movie werewolf.

The sun had set hours earlier. I obtained the pants shopping with Tiffany after our dinner date, and I was absolutely thrilled. I couldn’t wait to try it all on and see how it went together.

It was glorious. I donned the outfit, then slowly, almost ritualistically lowered the mask over my head to complete the costume.

It was like magic in the mirror. I looked myself over, and I loved what I saw. I looked like something out of Teen Wolf, only better. Sure, I could have achieved something very much like it far more cheaply. I could have just gone to Spirit Halloween, bought a costume or a rubber mask, and went to Walmart for finishing touches and adjustments, and done a satisfactory job for under $200, but that’s not what I wanted. I wanted the rizz. I wanted to stand out among all the other costumed partygoers at the fraternity Halloween party. This costume absolutely did it, and I couldn’t have been happier.

In my ecstasy, I noticed a . . . feeling running through my body, as though there was a kind of . . . energy coursing through me. It wasn’t as simple as “a burning in my blood” or “my nerves were on fire”. No, it was a feeling of power, as though I was still myself, but also something . . . more.

I felt as though I could toss four men over my shoulders and run a marathon. I felt as though I could get in a bar fight and kick every ass in the place. I felt . . . godly.

I removed the mask after a few minutes and inspected my outfit without it. I felt normal again, and, somehow, it felt wrong. I felt like my ordinary self was somehow no longer enough. I felt incomplete, like I removed a piece of myself when I removed the mask.

“Stop being ridiculous,” I told my reflection. “You’re letting myth and superstition influence you. You’re better than that!”

And yet, I felt like I was lying to myself. Right there, staring at my reflection, I felt like the man looking back at me wasn’t really me, like something unknowable was missing. I looked at my reflection and it felt as though I was looking at someone else, someone I didn’t really know, and who could never truly know me in return.

I shook my head to clear the strange thoughts and center myself again. “Pictures!” I reminded myself. “Tiffany wanted pictures so she could put together something complementary.”

I took out my phone and held it up to the mirror to take a picture, and paused. I couldn’t send her a picture like this. My costume was incomplete. I needed to wear the mask or else my costume wasn’t really my costume, and how could she possibly match her costume to mine if I sent her an incomplete photo?

I picked up the mask to put it on and paused. I paused to look at it, to admire it. I looked into its lifelike glass eyes. I stroked its fur as though it were a living thing. “You’re mine,” I told it in a low, almost silent voice. “You’re mine, and I am your master!”

I continued to stare into those perfectly crafted glass eyes, losing myself in them, and wanting nothing in the world so much as I wanted to put that mask on and forget myself. Slowly, almost robotically, I raised it up and gently lowered it over my head.

I felt a rush of euphoria, like what I felt earlier only a hundred times more potent. I took my phone in hand, opened the camera app, raised it, and snapped a single picture of myself in the mirror.

I opened text messaging, selected Tiffany, attached the message, and typed the following text: “It’s complete, and now I’m complete.”

I hit send. I looked into the mirror and met my own gaze staring back at me through those glass eyes that had no business looking as real and alive as they did, and then the world went blank.

\*\*\*\*\*

I awoke the next day with no idea where I was. I opened my eyes only to be greeted by the rising sun in the middle of a forest.

A forest?

There was a forest outside of town, but it wasn’t exactly a short walk if you catch my drift.

It was easily a half an hour’s drive once you got out of town, and not exactly the kind of thing you just get up and walk to like you’re taking the dog out to the local community park.

I woke up there, and not on the edge either, but well inside the borders, and I was covered in a red, sticky substance that could only be blood, and my stomach hurt like I had gotten drunk and did my best to eat my own body weight at the local Asian buffet.

“What the . . .” I trailed off as I looked at my hands and arms and was taken aback by the dried red and brown goop covering them. I looked down at myself and saw that I was still in my costume, and my clothing was utterly ruined, covered in a deep red liquid that was surely blood.

I realized that I was still wearing the mask, and I ripped it off of my head in a panic. My breath came in great heaves, uncontrollable, and my head began to swim as I hyperventilated.

I closed my eyes and forced myself to calm down. I made myself breathe slower, and slower, and slower still until I finally brought it down to normal. I focused on my heart rate, and gradually brought it down with a blend of deep breathing and mind clearing.

Once I had myself physically under control, I looked at myself again.

How did I get covered in such a disgustingly massive amount of blood? Why did my stomach hurt so much? How did the wolf mask manage to stay clean when the rest of me was drenched in filth? And why did I-

My stomach finally gave up and rebelled. I dropped the wolf mask and fell to my knees retching and vomiting a copious amount of stomach contents. I vomited even as I found myself losing my breath and desperately wanting to breathe. I vomited even as my lack of breath began to make my head swim. I vomited even as my vision blurred and blackened at the edges.

Then I was able to breathe again. I took in great, gasping gulps of air. I I heaved and panted as I sought to restore my oxygen supply.

Then I vomited again.

If possible, I can say that the second round was worse than the third. It didn’t hit me so continuously as to cut me off from breathing completely like the first round did, but it did let me get just enough breath to barely subsist before striking again until I thought I would surely pass out, and then it subsided just long enough to tease me again before taking over and nearly choking me to death over and over and over again until I wished that I could just die and get it over with,

When I was finally finished, my stomach felt better, but there was glistening pile of partially digested stomach contents all over the ground in front of me. I wish I could say that I knew what I was looking at, but it was all so thoroughly masticated that I couldn’t hope pick one bit from another. All I knew was that none of it looked cooked, and I didn’t see anything that could pass for a vegetable anywhere in the nasty mix.

My stomach felt better though.

I picked up my mask, chose a random direction, and began to walk. I must have chosen well, because after only two hours, I came across a road.

I’m not ignorant. I’ve driven in and out of town plenty of times. I know my way around in town and around the outskirts of my hometown. That’s why I knew that I needed to go left once I reached this road if I wanted to get home. How long would it take? Fucked if I know. All that mattered was I was going the right direction, and the rest would fall into place one way or another.

And fall into place it did. Less than an hour of walking later, A random pickup truck pulled over. The driver listened to my story, and told me to hop in the bed of his truck and he’d take me into town. I did it gratefully, and he was as good as his word, better even. He dropped me off outside my apartment building, told me to stay off the drugs, and went on his merry way.

I went inside, took the elevator to my floor, opened my door without needing to use my key, which was also weird since I never, ever, EVER left my apartment without locking it, and immediately rushed to the shower so I could get clean and feel human again.

I was brushing my teeth for the third time when I heard my phone ringing. It was on the floor, pushed up against the wall under the sink. Why? I don’t know. But I found it, pulled it out, and answered the call.

“Where have you been?” Tiffany practically shrieked in my ear. I’ve been calling and texting all night and I haven’t heard a word from you! If you didn’t pick up the phone this time I was going to call the cops to make sure you weren’t dead!”

On the one hand, it felt surreal being yelled at so mundanely after the freaky mystery I woke up to. On the other, what in the ever-living hell was going on?

I let my girlfriend yell for awhile until she was all shouted out. Then I responded. “I don’t know where I was last night,” I told her in a shaky voice. “One minute I was home, the next I was waking up in the middle of nowhere covered in blood.”

This set off another wave of panicked screeching that eventually settled down into sobbing and expressions of gratitude that I was alright. She told me she was coming right over and hung up before I could protest.

I had a very, very bad feeling about her coming over.

\*\*\*\*\*

It literally took all day to get Tiffany settled down and comfortable with the fact that that, in spite of everything, I was alright. I didn’t tell her about how my body had violently purged my stomach of an inhuman amount of raw flesh shortly after waking up. I was already washed up, and my bloody costume was in the wash getting as clean as I could hope for it to be.

It was actually the laundry that got her settled down. She volunteered to take my costume out of the dryer, and was absolutely delighted to see that I had added to it by dying in a bunch of red and brown staining. “It’s actually looks like you ripped something apart and ate it!” she said excitedly. “You’re so good at making Halloween costumes!”

“Yeah . . .” I said slowly before trailing off. “I modified it . . .”

She didn’t give me a chance to finish my words or my thoughts before she jumped me. Perhaps if she hadn’t been so excited and relieved that I was safe and healthy, things would have turned out differently. Perhaps if our intimate life wasn’t so . . . frequent and vigorous, everything would have turned out differently.

As it was, I succumbed to her passion, and we fell asleep in each other’s arms for an afternoon nap.

\*\*\*\*\*

I awoke before Tiffany did, and I went to the living room to examine the mask. I felt scared holding it. It felt wrong to put my hands upon that artifact, as though I was touching a power I could not hope to control or comprehend.

I turned it over, and over, and over again, examining it to the finest detail.

Why did this mask, out of everything I wore last night, not have a single drop of blood on it? Why was the last thing I could remember putting it on and taking a selfie?

That thought triggered something in me, and I took out my phone. I didn’t have it with me in the forest, and I couldn’t remember checking the picture I took or sending it to Tiffany.

I opened the photos and looked at the last picture I took.

I don’t know what I was expecting. Maybe a photo of myself mid-metamorphosis. Mayne I thought I’d catch myself becoming something other than, well, me. What I actually saw was me, in my costume, with my phone in my hand.

I looked at the picture again, not really believing that it could be so mundane, and I thought I could see something . . . different in those lifelike glass eyes, I though that maybe, just maybe there was a hint of something in there that was not only me. But no. It couldn’t be. The supernatural isn’t real after all. It’s all hokum. Bunk. Small-minded garbage that enlightened people like me didn’t believe in.

The sun had set. It wasn’t down for long, but it was the second day of the rarest kind of blue moon event, the kind where the full moon happens two days in a row. I looked into the eyes of the mask, this perfect, masterfully crafted mask, lifted it up, and lowered it onto my head.

\*\*\*\*\*

I woke up the next morning, the nineteenth of October, a mere week ago to the most horrifying sight of my life.

I awoke on the floor of my own apartment, but once again, I was covered in blood and filth.

“How?” I screamed in horror, not understanding where the ungodly mess had come from.

My stomach was killing me. I rushed to my bathroom and barely made it to the toilet before my stomach decided to evacuate its contents, then and keep evacuating itself even when there was nothing but water and bile left to push out. It went on, and on, and on, until I wished I would just die rather than endure another moment of such violent illness.

I flushed the toilet whenever I had the presence of mind to do so without checking to see what had come out of me. I had seen what came out the day before, and I didn’t want to see it again. Perhaps that’s why I failed to recognize any of the bits and parts, the solid matter mixed in with the wretched fluids that erupted from my stomach and out of my mouth.

Regardless, I was glued to the toilet until my stomach finally settled down after who-knows how long. Then I stripped my bloody clothing and took a shower so hot I felt like it might burn the skin from my bones, and I was okay with that.

I felt dirty inside and out. It was wrong. Wrong in every way. Down to my soul if I had believed it at the time, I felt wrong, dirty, and thoroughly corrupted.

I was in the shower for an hour, lost in feelings rather than thought. Wondering what had happened and how I managed to wind up covered in blood again in my own apartment. It was only when I finally shut off the water and was halfway through drying off that it hit me.

Tiffany!”

I screamed, and I ran to my bedroom.

I burst into my bedroom, and was greeted by the most horrific mess I could possibly imagine. The entire room was splattered with blood and viscera. Not a surface was spared as at least some red drops or other . . . scraps was on every surface, every knick-knack, every everything in the room

My screams only got louder and more insistent as I scanned the room and found the head of Tifany, my beautiful Tiffany, beloved girlfriend of three years, on a pillow, fully detached from her body, lifeless eyes staring off into the void. I hurled myself to it, reaching desperately, not willing to believe in what I was seeing.

I picked it up and stared into her sightless eyes, and burst into tears. “Tiffany,” I sobbed. “How? Why?”

I looked around and took the horrific scene in. I recognized the various parts of my beloved scattered around the room. Legs and arms tossed about, bones scattered all over, looking like they had been gnawed upon by a great beast. And not one of her internal organs to be seen.

I remembered how upset my stomach was when I woke up, and how distended it appeared before I threw up the contents in a prolonged, and violent fit. How much of her had I simply flushed away, not knowing what I was doing because I refused to just open my eyes as I vomited up my sick?

I dropped Tiffany’s head back onto my bed and scrambled to the living room. I picked up the diary of Archibald Wembly and read it thoroughly. Much of it was a repeat of what I had already read before in the other provenance, until I got to the end. Here is what is read:

*I should have listened to the rules. I should have learned from the mistakes of others. I didn’t, and now I am paying the price for my foolishness. The mask is gone, but I can feel it’s influence on me even as I write these words.  I blacked out again last night, and when I awoke this morning, my family was dead, ripped apart from some foul beast. Every last one of them. My wife Abigail, and the children George, Franklin, Erin, and Caleb. All of them were torn apart. Only I was spared, and I was covered in such an amount of blood and gore that it could only have come from many animals, of a family of people. I ignored the rules. I wore the mask at night. I wore it on the full moon. It amused me to do so, and I did it without once invoking the name of Christ for protection.*

*I was a fool, and my family has paid the price for my pride and lack of faith. The mask is gone, but I can still feel it within me somehow, as though it has become a part of me. I do not know what the future will bring, but I fear it will be more bloodshed, and it will be me in some beastly form, rending apart my fellow man in bestial glee.*

*I only hope that someone stops me before I go too far.*

*God help me and spare the innocent.*

I put the diary down and sat back stunned, then it dawned on me: Where was the wolf mask?

I tore my apartment searching for it, I really did, but I could not find it. Still, I can feel its presence, like it’s lost, but also not. It’s like it’s here with me even though I cannot see it.

Today is only five days until Halloween. The sun has set, and I feel . . . strong, stronger than I have any right to feel. My dead girlfriend remains rotting in my bedroom, and it smells horrible. The neighbors are sure to complain soon.

I don’t understand what’s going on, but I do know this: I never should have bought that mask, and once I bought it, I never should have broken the rules. How was I supposed to know it was a real cursed object? There’s no science that can explain curses, real, magical curses. Magic isn’t real, right?

Who am I kidding. I believe in magic . . . now. But I came to believe too late. Too late to save my beloved Tiffany, and too late to save myself.

I need to flee. I need to get away from here, as soon as possible. I can feel the beast inside of me, and it wants to get out. I need to get as far away from people as possible, to disappear and never be seen again.

But I’m hungry, and there’s a great nightclub not far from here, and the night is young.

Perhaps I’ll stop in for a bite to eat before I begin my journey.",1,1729994469.0,JordanGrupeHorror,0,1.0,False
1gd0mi3,https://www.reddit.com/r/DrCreepensVault/comments/1gd0mi3/the_mask_of_the_loup_garou/,The Mask of the Loup Garou,"I never should have entered that antique store, and I definitely shouldn’t have bought that mask. Gannon’s is known for buying and selling rare and unique antiques, and I wanted to impress my friends with a unique Halloween costume this year, so I thought the perfect solution would be to get my hands on a genuine antique costume, one of those strange, ultra creepy ones from the 1800’s or earlier. Sure, it would cost me, but can you really put a price on standing out?

The bell over the door jingled dully as I opened the door and walked in. The proprietor, and gray, bent over man with a thick, bushy beard and thick, round rimmed spectacles who was ninety if he was a day casually acknowledged me and went back to the ancient book he was examining.

The store wasn’t big, but it had space, only every last bit of that space was filled with relics of bygone eras. Not the usual furniture, silverware, and paintings of your typical antique shop. No. Everything here had a story, and as such, everything here commanded a premium price.

There was an old cavalry saber that was known to have killed no less than seven men in the Civil War. It even still had flecks of blood from its victims spattered along the blade and hilt. There was an old rope noose that had supposedly been used to hang a witch during the Salem Witch Trials. There was an ancient tome with strange symbols on the cover that once belonged to a European court wizard. There was even a hat that once belonged to a certain H. H. Holmes. The stories attached to each item were historical, mystical, and often macabre. And I loved it.

I didn’t believe in magic or mysticism, angels and demons, or anything else beyond what science could explain. That didn’t mean that I wasn’t fascinated by stories involving them though. How much more interesting would the world be if the supernatural actually did exist? It was a tantalizing proposition, and it’s why I had to buy it as soon as I saw it.

It was a wolf mask. Not a mask made to look like a wolf, but a mask made out of the skin and fur of a wolf’s head and neck. It was a masterful work of preservation and artistry that looked as alive on display that day as the creature itself must have looked in life.

I picked it up carefully, turning it over and around in my hand so I could see it from every angle. The work was beyond fine. I couldn’t even see the seams and threads that held it together. Not a single hair seemed to be missing from the thick, gray fur. The teeth were real, and firmly fixed into the snout. I assumed they were so well-done because the original jaws had been used to form the snarling mouth. The eyes were glass, and far too lifelike for such an aged item. Perfect replicas of thin glass set in the eye sockets.

I had to have it.

I checked the story card next to the original display. The price was outrageous, but I didn’t care. Not only was the mask perfect, but the supposed history couldn’t have been more ideal for the season.

It read simply: *Enchanted mask made from the preserved skin of a Loup Garou slain in Burgundy, France in 1137 AD. Do not wear at night.*

“Oh hohohoho,” I grunted excitedly. “I have plans for you!”

I brought the mask and story card to the checkout. Old man Gannon checked the item, and me with more scrutiny than I was really comfortable with before speaking. “Heed the warning boy,” he said sternly. “It wouldn’t do for you to tempt fate.”

I chuckled, ignoring the fact that he called me “boy”. He was probably the oldest man in town, so everyone was “boy” or “girl” to him. “You don’t have to worry about me,” I assured him. “You got any more documentation that goes with this? If I’m going to fork over two-thousand dollars for a mask, I want as much provenance as I can get.”

Old man Gannon grunted derisively. “Of course I have documents that go with it. A fair few actually. Be sure that you read them and take proper precautions.”

“Of course,” I replied seriously, lying through my teeth. The supernatural is not real after all. It’s a myth, legend, just stories. What this mask was, to me, was the foundation of the absolute best Halloween costume I had ever concocted. Sure, a werewolf costume wouldn’t be especially unique, but with that mask, it would be the most frighteningly real one our town had ever seen.

The old man went into the back room and quickly returned with a binder filled with documents in protectors, and a small leatherbound journal. “These are the provenance,” he declared. “The journal is of particular interest as it belonged to a previous owner of the mask, a Mr. Archibald Wembly of London, wrote it in the years Fifteen-Twelve through Fifteen-Fourteen. He went mad after wearing the mask and killed two people before he was cut down in the street. Witnesses swore that he looked more animal than man before he died. The police report is document one-hundred-twenty-three.”

I set the mask on the counter and quickly leafed through the documents. There were originals, and English translations for each. “All this and you’re only charging two-thousand dollars?” I asked incredulously. “Such a unique relic with this much provenance together . . . it has to be worth more.”

Old man Gannon nodded his head. “Yes. Yes it is,” he confirmed. “I actually paid more for it myself, but . . .” he trailed off. “Something about that particular item unsettles me. I wish to be rid of it sooner rather than later, so I’m taking a loss for my own peace of mind.”

I didn’t question it. If this old man was willing to let his superstitions be my gain, I was perfectly fine with it. I paid for the mask and happily took it home.

Looking back, I should never have been so sure of myself. Nor so proud. Nor so certain about how the world works. The events that followed changed my perspective of the nature of reality itself, and I don’t think I’ll ever be able to go back to how I was.

In my defense, and also to remove any possibility that I can claim ignorance if I get desperate enough, I need to confess that I did read the provenance documents right away. I didn’t read them to get any warnings to heed, or as some kind of user manual. I read them to learn the history of my beautiful, terrifyingly creepy wolf mask. Having the story at the tip of my tongue top tell at will would truly be the icing on what I knew would be a most impressive, and frightening cake, or, rather, costume.

The earliest documents were all about the supposed Loup Garou that was terrorizing the Burgundian countryside, and the hunt to put an end to the gruesome string of murders it was blamed for. Document twenty was a notice celebrating that the foul beast had finally been killed and skinned by a visiting huntsman who only asked to be allowed to keep the skin and take it back to him home as his reward. The local ruler, only too happy to get off so cheaply, permitted it.

The huntsman wrote that he brought the hide to a supposed witch named Lucia, who lived alone on a mountain named Muzsla in modern day Slovakia. He paid her handsomely with instructions to use the hide to create an item of power. One that would make him strong.

Apparently, she obliged, making the wolf mask, and he was happy, but it came with a strict set of rules. 1. Never wear the mask at night. 2. Never wear the mask on the day or night of the full moon. 3. Never wear the mask during the autumnal equinox. 4. Always invoke the name of Christ before donning the mask.

The man must have been wildly superstitious, because he followed the rules religiously. The following documents are filled with fanciful tales of the huntsman performing mighty deeds that led to him earning a minor lordship before retiring to administer his land holdings and eventually dying of old age.

What followed after was one document after another that spoke of the mask passing to a new owner who either did not read, or chose not to follow the rules, and how each one ultimately went mad, committing a varying number of murders, and being either killed during the apprehension, or executed for their crimes. It gained a reputation as a cursed item that turned men into mindless beasts and drove them to kill and even cannibalize their victims.

“Holy crap!” I exclaimed as I finished reading the last page in the binder. “This is even better than I thought! I wonder what that Wembly guy wrote in his diary!”

It was getting late, so I decided to put off reading the diary for another day. I picked up my mask and looked it over, admiring it for both its craftsmanship and its history. “You just might be the coolest thing I’ll ever own,” I said to it as I caressed its cheek.

I looked into the glass eyes, and maybe it was a trick of the light, or maybe it was the lateness of the hour playing tricks with my mind, but I could have sworn those eyes, those glass eyes, looked back at me.

\*\*\*\*

I awoke the next morning to my girlfriend letting herself into my apartment. Her key clicked in the lock, and the door squeaked noisily as she opened it.

“Wake up sleepyhead!” she called.

I sat up and groaned in response as I rubbed the sleep out of my eyes. I checked the clock on my nightstand, saw the time, and got annoyed. “It’s seven a.m. on a Saturday!”

“We have plan’s remember?” she called out. “We’re supposed to . . . what is this?” she asked. Her tone changed from businesslike to pure excitement.

I stepped out of my bedroom clad in nothing but my night pants. She was excitedly holding up the wolf mask and admiring it. “It’s a cursed wolf mask,” I replied with a yawn. “It’s the centerpiece of my Halloween costume this year.”

“It’s looks so real,” she said admiringly, then her expression darkened and she put the mask down on the table. “Did you say ‘cursed’?” she sharply inquired.

“Yeah,” I yawned again. “It’s almost a thousand years old. The documents it came with say that a bunch of its previous owners went psycho and started killing people.”

“And you bought it?” she practically shrieked. “And you’re going to wear it?”

I filled the coffee maker and turned it on. “Don’t tell me you believe in magic, voodoo, curses, and all that nonsense,” I replied tiredly.

She took pause at that. I knew her answer, it was a major point of agreement between us. What science can’t explain either isn’t real, or just hasn’t been properly explained yet. Nothing is supernatural.

She finally replied. It’s just . . .” she paused. “If a bunch of people who owned it really did turn into psycho killers, there’s gotta be something there.”

I poured a cup of black coffee from the still brewing pot and took a sip. It was too hot but I didn’t care. “Sure there is,” I replied. “Social contagion. People believe it’s cursed, so they respond as though it’s cursed. It’s nothing special.”

It must have made sense to her, because he whole attitude changed again. “Have you tried it on yet?” she asked with a slight smile, her fear replaced with the admiration and curiosity she had when she first laid eyes on the mask.

It struck me that I hadn’t, so I picked it up, looked my girlfriend in the eyes, said “Jesus Christ” in a mocking tone, and put it on. It felt . . . perfect, as though it were made just for me. It slipped over my head easily and seemed to snug down to a perfect form fit. It had no odor, and I could see clearly with a full field of view through the glass eyes. “Not until just now,” I replied teasingly.

“EEEEK!” she shrieked.

“What?” I asked, alarmed, turning my head rapidly to see what had so alarmed her.

“The mouth moved when you talked!” she squealed. “It moved, and it moved in a perfect match for your words!”

I cocked my head to the side and looked at her quizzically. “For real?” I asked. It’s moving with my mouth?”

“Yes!’ she said excitedly. “Go see in the mirror!”

I did. I spoke. “Abracadabra, hocus pokus, jiggedy jokeus!” I said to my reflection.

Sure enough, the mouth moved in a lupine imitation of my own mouth movements. The movement were so well synced that I could swear I even saw the lips move although I knew it to be impossible. I took the mask off and admired it with the fattest grin of all time on my face.

“That’s amazing!” I exclaimed. “That old witch was a real master! I didn’t know people even knew how to make a mask’s mouth move in the twelfth century!?

“I know right?” My girlfriend, Tiffany said with as much excitement as I felt. “You’re going to have an amazing Halloween costume this year!”

I removed the mask, smiled at her, an nodded my head in affirmation.

“Just one thing,” she said with a hint of confusion. “What’s with that thing you said before you put the mask on?”

It took me a moment to remember what she was talking about. “Oh!” I snapped my fingers as I remembered. “There was a silly little list of rules, I was mocking them.” I grabbed the folder of provenance and flipped to the page with the rules on it. “See?” I said, pointing at the small passage. “Four ridiculous rules.”

Tiffany read them quickly and looked at me with a touch of confusion. “People actually believed this crap?” she said incredulously.

“I know, right?” I laughed.

She laughed with me for a bit, then stopped suddenly and glared at me. “Wait a minute,” she said sternly. “How much did you pay for this mask anyway?”

\*\*\*\*\*

The next few days were perfectly ordinary until the seventeenth. That was the day I finished assembling my costume, and one of two full moons in a row this year. I remember bringing home a pair of retro ripped jeans to go with the red plaid flannel shirt, theater prop quality werewolf gloves, complete with a set of long claws tipping the fingers, and other clothing reminiscent of an 80’s era movie werewolf.

The sun had set hours earlier. I obtained the pants shopping with Tiffany after our dinner date, and I was absolutely thrilled. I couldn’t wait to try it all on and see how it went together.

It was glorious. I donned the outfit, then slowly, almost ritualistically lowered the mask over my head to complete the costume.

It was like magic in the mirror. I looked myself over, and I loved what I saw. I looked like something out of Teen Wolf, only better. Sure, I could have achieved something very much like it far more cheaply. I could have just gone to Spirit Halloween, bought a costume or a rubber mask, and went to Walmart for finishing touches and adjustments, and done a satisfactory job for under $200, but that’s not what I wanted. I wanted the rizz. I wanted to stand out among all the other costumed partygoers at the fraternity Halloween party. This costume absolutely did it, and I couldn’t have been happier.

In my ecstasy, I noticed a . . . feeling running through my body, as though there was a kind of . . . energy coursing through me. It wasn’t as simple as “a burning in my blood” or “my nerves were on fire”. No, it was a feeling of power, as though I was still myself, but also something . . . more.

I felt as though I could toss four men over my shoulders and run a marathon. I felt as though I could get in a bar fight and kick every ass in the place. I felt . . . godly.

I removed the mask after a few minutes and inspected my outfit without it. I felt normal again, and, somehow, it felt wrong. I felt like my ordinary self was somehow no longer enough. I felt incomplete, like I removed a piece of myself when I removed the mask.

“Stop being ridiculous,” I told my reflection. “You’re letting myth and superstition influence you. You’re better than that!”

And yet, I felt like I was lying to myself. Right there, staring at my reflection, I felt like the man looking back at me wasn’t really me, like something unknowable was missing. I looked at my reflection and it felt as though I was looking at someone else, someone I didn’t really know, and who could never truly know me in return.

I shook my head to clear the strange thoughts and center myself again. “Pictures!” I reminded myself. “Tiffany wanted pictures so she could put together something complementary.”

I took out my phone and held it up to the mirror to take a picture, and paused. I couldn’t send her a picture like this. My costume was incomplete. I needed to wear the mask or else my costume wasn’t really my costume, and how could she possibly match her costume to mine if I sent her an incomplete photo?

I picked up the mask to put it on and paused. I paused to look at it, to admire it. I looked into its lifelike glass eyes. I stroked its fur as though it were a living thing. “You’re mine,” I told it in a low, almost silent voice. “You’re mine, and I am your master!”

I continued to stare into those perfectly crafted glass eyes, losing myself in them, and wanting nothing in the world so much as I wanted to put that mask on and forget myself. Slowly, almost robotically, I raised it up and gently lowered it over my head.

I felt a rush of euphoria, like what I felt earlier only a hundred times more potent. I took my phone in hand, opened the camera app, raised it, and snapped a single picture of myself in the mirror.

I opened text messaging, selected Tiffany, attached the message, and typed the following text: “It’s complete, and now I’m complete.”

I hit send. I looked into the mirror and met my own gaze staring back at me through those glass eyes that had no business looking as real and alive as they did, and then the world went blank.

\*\*\*\*\*

I awoke the next day with no idea where I was. I opened my eyes only to be greeted by the rising sun in the middle of a forest.

A forest?

There was a forest outside of town, but it wasn’t exactly a short walk if you catch my drift.

It was easily a half an hour’s drive once you got out of town, and not exactly the kind of thing you just get up and walk to like you’re taking the dog out to the local community park.

I woke up there, and not on the edge either, but well inside the borders, and I was covered in a red, sticky substance that could only be blood, and my stomach hurt like I had gotten drunk and did my best to eat my own body weight at the local Asian buffet.

“What the . . .” I trailed off as I looked at my hands and arms and was taken aback by the dried red and brown goop covering them. I looked down at myself and saw that I was still in my costume, and my clothing was utterly ruined, covered in a deep red liquid that was surely blood.

I realized that I was still wearing the mask, and I ripped it off of my head in a panic. My breath came in great heaves, uncontrollable, and my head began to swim as I hyperventilated.

I closed my eyes and forced myself to calm down. I made myself breathe slower, and slower, and slower still until I finally brought it down to normal. I focused on my heart rate, and gradually brought it down with a blend of deep breathing and mind clearing.

Once I had myself physically under control, I looked at myself again.

How did I get covered in such a disgustingly massive amount of blood? Why did my stomach hurt so much? How did the wolf mask manage to stay clean when the rest of me was drenched in filth? And why did I-

My stomach finally gave up and rebelled. I dropped the wolf mask and fell to my knees retching and vomiting a copious amount of stomach contents. I vomited even as I found myself losing my breath and desperately wanting to breathe. I vomited even as my lack of breath began to make my head swim. I vomited even as my vision blurred and blackened at the edges.

Then I was able to breathe again. I took in great, gasping gulps of air. I I heaved and panted as I sought to restore my oxygen supply.

Then I vomited again.

If possible, I can say that the second round was worse than the third. It didn’t hit me so continuously as to cut me off from breathing completely like the first round did, but it did let me get just enough breath to barely subsist before striking again until I thought I would surely pass out, and then it subsided just long enough to tease me again before taking over and nearly choking me to death over and over and over again until I wished that I could just die and get it over with,

When I was finally finished, my stomach felt better, but there was glistening pile of partially digested stomach contents all over the ground in front of me. I wish I could say that I knew what I was looking at, but it was all so thoroughly masticated that I couldn’t hope pick one bit from another. All I knew was that none of it looked cooked, and I didn’t see anything that could pass for a vegetable anywhere in the nasty mix.

My stomach felt better though.

I picked up my mask, chose a random direction, and began to walk. I must have chosen well, because after only two hours, I came across a road.

I’m not ignorant. I’ve driven in and out of town plenty of times. I know my way around in town and around the outskirts of my hometown. That’s why I knew that I needed to go left once I reached this road if I wanted to get home. How long would it take? Fucked if I know. All that mattered was I was going the right direction, and the rest would fall into place one way or another.

And fall into place it did. Less than an hour of walking later, A random pickup truck pulled over. The driver listened to my story, and told me to hop in the bed of his truck and he’d take me into town. I did it gratefully, and he was as good as his word, better even. He dropped me off outside my apartment building, told me to stay off the drugs, and went on his merry way.

I went inside, took the elevator to my floor, opened my door without needing to use my key, which was also weird since I never, ever, EVER left my apartment without locking it, and immediately rushed to the shower so I could get clean and feel human again.

I was brushing my teeth for the third time when I heard my phone ringing. It was on the floor, pushed up against the wall under the sink. Why? I don’t know. But I found it, pulled it out, and answered the call.

“Where have you been?” Tiffany practically shrieked in my ear. I’ve been calling and texting all night and I haven’t heard a word from you! If you didn’t pick up the phone this time I was going to call the cops to make sure you weren’t dead!”

On the one hand, it felt surreal being yelled at so mundanely after the freaky mystery I woke up to. On the other, what in the ever-living hell was going on?

I let my girlfriend yell for awhile until she was all shouted out. Then I responded. “I don’t know where I was last night,” I told her in a shaky voice. “One minute I was home, the next I was waking up in the middle of nowhere covered in blood.”

This set off another wave of panicked screeching that eventually settled down into sobbing and expressions of gratitude that I was alright. She told me she was coming right over and hung up before I could protest.

I had a very, very bad feeling about her coming over.

\*\*\*\*\*

It literally took all day to get Tiffany settled down and comfortable with the fact that that, in spite of everything, I was alright. I didn’t tell her about how my body had violently purged my stomach of an inhuman amount of raw flesh shortly after waking up. I was already washed up, and my bloody costume was in the wash getting as clean as I could hope for it to be.

It was actually the laundry that got her settled down. She volunteered to take my costume out of the dryer, and was absolutely delighted to see that I had added to it by dying in a bunch of red and brown staining. “It’s actually looks like you ripped something apart and ate it!” she said excitedly. “You’re so good at making Halloween costumes!”

“Yeah . . .” I said slowly before trailing off. “I modified it . . .”

She didn’t give me a chance to finish my words or my thoughts before she jumped me. Perhaps if she hadn’t been so excited and relieved that I was safe and healthy, things would have turned out differently. Perhaps if our intimate life wasn’t so . . . frequent and vigorous, everything would have turned out differently.

As it was, I succumbed to her passion, and we fell asleep in each other’s arms for an afternoon nap.

\*\*\*\*\*

I awoke before Tiffany did, and I went to the living room to examine the mask. I felt scared holding it. It felt wrong to put my hands upon that artifact, as though I was touching a power I could not hope to control or comprehend.

I turned it over, and over, and over again, examining it to the finest detail.

Why did this mask, out of everything I wore last night, not have a single drop of blood on it? Why was the last thing I could remember putting it on and taking a selfie?

That thought triggered something in me, and I took out my phone. I didn’t have it with me in the forest, and I couldn’t remember checking the picture I took or sending it to Tiffany.

I opened the photos and looked at the last picture I took.

I don’t know what I was expecting. Maybe a photo of myself mid-metamorphosis. Mayne I thought I’d catch myself becoming something other than, well, me. What I actually saw was me, in my costume, with my phone in my hand.

I looked at the picture again, not really believing that it could be so mundane, and I thought I could see something . . . different in those lifelike glass eyes, I though that maybe, just maybe there was a hint of something in there that was not only me. But no. It couldn’t be. The supernatural isn’t real after all. It’s all hokum. Bunk. Small-minded garbage that enlightened people like me didn’t believe in.

The sun had set. It wasn’t down for long, but it was the second day of the rarest kind of blue moon event, the kind where the full moon happens two days in a row. I looked into the eyes of the mask, this perfect, masterfully crafted mask, lifted it up, and lowered it onto my head.

\*\*\*\*\*

I woke up the next morning, the nineteenth of October, a mere week ago to the most horrifying sight of my life.

I awoke on the floor of my own apartment, but once again, I was covered in blood and filth.

“How?” I screamed in horror, not understanding where the ungodly mess had come from.

My stomach was killing me. I rushed to my bathroom and barely made it to the toilet before my stomach decided to evacuate its contents, then and keep evacuating itself even when there was nothing but water and bile left to push out. It went on, and on, and on, until I wished I would just die rather than endure another moment of such violent illness.

I flushed the toilet whenever I had the presence of mind to do so without checking to see what had come out of me. I had seen what came out the day before, and I didn’t want to see it again. Perhaps that’s why I failed to recognize any of the bits and parts, the solid matter mixed in with the wretched fluids that erupted from my stomach and out of my mouth.

Regardless, I was glued to the toilet until my stomach finally settled down after who-knows how long. Then I stripped my bloody clothing and took a shower so hot I felt like it might burn the skin from my bones, and I was okay with that.

I felt dirty inside and out. It was wrong. Wrong in every way. Down to my soul if I had believed it at the time, I felt wrong, dirty, and thoroughly corrupted.

I was in the shower for an hour, lost in feelings rather than thought. Wondering what had happened and how I managed to wind up covered in blood again in my own apartment. It was only when I finally shut off the water and was halfway through drying off that it hit me.

Tiffany!”

I screamed, and I ran to my bedroom.

I burst into my bedroom, and was greeted by the most horrific mess I could possibly imagine. The entire room was splattered with blood and viscera. Not a surface was spared as at least some red drops or other . . . scraps was on every surface, every knick-knack, every everything in the room

My screams only got louder and more insistent as I scanned the room and found the head of Tifany, my beautiful Tiffany, beloved girlfriend of three years, on a pillow, fully detached from her body, lifeless eyes staring off into the void. I hurled myself to it, reaching desperately, not willing to believe in what I was seeing.

I picked it up and stared into her sightless eyes, and burst into tears. “Tiffany,” I sobbed. “How? Why?”

I looked around and took the horrific scene in. I recognized the various parts of my beloved scattered around the room. Legs and arms tossed about, bones scattered all over, looking like they had been gnawed upon by a great beast. And not one of her internal organs to be seen.

I remembered how upset my stomach was when I woke up, and how distended it appeared before I threw up the contents in a prolonged, and violent fit. How much of her had I simply flushed away, not knowing what I was doing because I refused to just open my eyes as I vomited up my sick?

I dropped Tiffany’s head back onto my bed and scrambled to the living room. I picked up the diary of Archibald Wembly and read it thoroughly. Much of it was a repeat of what I had already read before in the other provenance, until I got to the end. Here is what is read:

*I should have listened to the rules. I should have learned from the mistakes of others. I didn’t, and now I am paying the price for my foolishness. The mask is gone, but I can feel it’s influence on me even as I write these words.  I blacked out again last night, and when I awoke this morning, my family was dead, ripped apart from some foul beast. Every last one of them. My wife Abigail, and the children George, Franklin, Erin, and Caleb. All of them were torn apart. Only I was spared, and I was covered in such an amount of blood and gore that it could only have come from many animals, of a family of people. I ignored the rules. I wore the mask at night. I wore it on the full moon. It amused me to do so, and I did it without once invoking the name of Christ for protection.*

*I was a fool, and my family has paid the price for my pride and lack of faith. The mask is gone, but I can still feel it within me somehow, as though it has become a part of me. I do not know what the future will bring, but I fear it will be more bloodshed, and it will be me in some beastly form, rending apart my fellow man in bestial glee.*

*I only hope that someone stops me before I go too far.*

*God help me and spare the innocent.*

I put the diary down and sat back stunned, then it dawned on me: Where was the wolf mask?

I tore my apartment searching for it, I really did, but I could not find it. Still, I can feel its presence, like it’s lost, but also not. It’s like it’s here with me even though I cannot see it.

Today is only five days until Halloween. The sun has set, and I feel . . . strong, stronger than I have any right to feel. My dead girlfriend remains rotting in my bedroom, and it smells horrible. The neighbors are sure to complain soon.

I don’t understand what’s going on, but I do know this: I never should have bought that mask, and once I bought it, I never should have broken the rules. How was I supposed to know it was a real cursed object? There’s no science that can explain curses, real, magical curses. Magic isn’t real, right?

Who am I kidding. I believe in magic . . . now. But I came to believe too late. Too late to save my beloved Tiffany, and too late to save myself.

I need to flee. I need to get away from here, as soon as possible. I can feel the beast inside of me, and it wants to get out. I need to get as far away from people as possible, to disappear and never be seen again.

But I’m hungry, and there’s a great nightclub not far from here, and the night is young.

Gannon’s is known for buying and selling rare and unique antiques, and I wanted to impress my friends with a unique Halloween costume this year, so I thought the perfect solution would be to get my hands on a genuine antique costume, one of those strange, ultra creepy ones from the 1800’s or earlier. Sure, it would cost me, but can you really put a price on standing out?

The bell over the door jingled dully as I opened the door and walked in. The proprietor, and gray, bent over man with a thick, bushy beard and thick, round rimmed spectacles who was ninety if he was a day casually acknowledged me and went back to the ancient book he was examining.

The store wasn’t big, but it had space, only every last bit of that space was filled with relics of bygone eras. Not the usual furniture, silverware, and paintings of your typical antique shop. No. Everything here had a story, and as such, everything here commanded a premium price.

There was an old cavalry saber that was known to have killed no less than seven men in the Civil War. It even still had flecks of blood from its victims spattered along the blade and hilt. There was an old rope noose that had supposedly been used to hang a witch during the Salem Witch Trials. There was an ancient tome with strange symbols on the cover that once belonged to a European court wizard. There was even a hat that once belonged to a certain H. H. Holmes. The stories attached to each item were historical, mystical, and often macabre. And I loved it.

I didn’t believe in magic or mysticism, angels and demons, or anything else beyond what science could explain. That didn’t mean that I wasn’t fascinated by stories involving them though. How much more interesting would the world be if the supernatural actually did exist? It was a tantalizing proposition, and it’s why I had to buy it as soon as I saw it.

It was a wolf mask. Not a mask made to look like a wolf, but a mask made out of the skin and fur of a wolf’s head and neck. It was a masterful work of preservation and artistry that looked as alive on display that day as the creature itself must have looked in life.

I picked it up carefully, turning it over and around in my hand so I could see it from every angle. The work was beyond fine. I couldn’t even see the seams and threads that held it together. Not a single hair seemed to be missing from the thick, gray fur. The teeth were real, and firmly fixed into the snout. I assumed they were so well-done because the original jaws had been used to form the snarling mouth. The eyes were glass, and far too lifelike for such an aged item. Perfect replicas of thin glass set in the eye sockets.

I had to have it.

I checked the story card next to the original display. The price was outrageous, but I didn’t care. Not only was the mask perfect, but the supposed history couldn’t have been more ideal for the season.

It read simply: *Enchanted mask made from the preserved skin of a Loup Garou slain in Burgundy, France in 1137 AD. Do not wear at night.*

“Oh hohohoho,” I grunted excitedly. “I have plans for you!”

I brought the mask and story card to the checkout. Old man Gannon checked the item, and me with more scrutiny than I was really comfortable with before speaking. “Heed the warning boy,” he said sternly. “It wouldn’t do for you to tempt fate.”

I chuckled, ignoring the fact that he called me “boy”. He was probably the oldest man in town, so everyone was “boy” or “girl” to him. “You don’t have to worry about me,” I assured him. “You got any more documentation that goes with this? If I’m going to fork over two-thousand dollars for a mask, I want as much provenance as I can get.”

Old man Gannon grunted derisively. “Of course I have documents that go with it. A fair few actually. Be sure that you read them and take proper precautions.”

“Of course,” I replied seriously, lying through my teeth. The supernatural is not real after all. It’s a myth, legend, just stories. What this mask was, to me, was the foundation of the absolute best Halloween costume I had ever concocted. Sure, a werewolf costume wouldn’t be especially unique, but with that mask, it would be the most frighteningly real one our town had ever seen.

The old man went into the back room and quickly returned with a binder filled with documents in protectors, and a small leatherbound journal. “These are the provenance,” he declared. “The journal is of particular interest as it belonged to a previous owner of the mask, a Mr. Archibald Wembly of London, wrote it in the years Fifteen-Twelve through Fifteen-Fourteen. He went mad after wearing the mask and killed two people before he was cut down in the street. Witnesses swore that he looked more animal than man before he died. The police report is document one-hundred-twenty-three.”

I set the mask on the counter and quickly leafed through the documents. There were originals, and English translations for each. “All this and you’re only charging two-thousand dollars?” I asked incredulously. “Such a unique relic with this much provenance together . . . it has to be worth more.”

Old man Gannon nodded his head. “Yes. Yes it is,” he confirmed. “I actually paid more for it myself, but . . .” he trailed off. “Something about that particular item unsettles me. I wish to be rid of it sooner rather than later, so I’m taking a loss for my own peace of mind.”

I didn’t question it. If this old man was willing to let his superstitions be my gain, I was perfectly fine with it. I paid for the mask and happily took it home.

Looking back, I should never have been so sure of myself. Nor so proud. Nor so certain about how the world works. The events that followed changed my perspective of the nature of reality itself, and I don’t think I’ll ever be able to go back to how I was.

In my defense, and also to remove any possibility that I can claim ignorance if I get desperate enough, I need to confess that I did read the provenance documents right away. I didn’t read them to get any warnings to heed, or as some kind of user manual. I read them to learn the history of my beautiful, terrifyingly creepy wolf mask. Having the story at the tip of my tongue top tell at will would truly be the icing on what I knew would be a most impressive, and frightening cake, or, rather, costume.

The earliest documents were all about the supposed Loup Garou that was terrorizing the Burgundian countryside, and the hunt to put an end to the gruesome string of murders it was blamed for. Document twenty was a notice celebrating that the foul beast had finally been killed and skinned by a visiting huntsman who only asked to be allowed to keep the skin and take it back to him home as his reward. The local ruler, only too happy to get off so cheaply, permitted it.

The huntsman wrote that he brought the hide to a supposed witch named Lucia, who lived alone on a mountain named Muzsla in modern day Slovakia. He paid her handsomely with instructions to use the hide to create an item of power. One that would make him strong.

Apparently, she obliged, making the wolf mask, and he was happy, but it came with a strict set of rules. 1. Never wear the mask at night. 2. Never wear the mask on the day or night of the full moon. 3. Never wear the mask during the autumnal equinox. 4. Always invoke the name of Christ before donning the mask.

The man must have been wildly superstitious, because he followed the rules religiously. The following documents are filled with fanciful tales of the huntsman performing mighty deeds that led to him earning a minor lordship before retiring to administer his land holdings and eventually dying of old age.

What followed after was one document after another that spoke of the mask passing to a new owner who either did not read, or chose not to follow the rules, and how each one ultimately went mad, committing a varying number of murders, and being either killed during the apprehension, or executed for their crimes. It gained a reputation as a cursed item that turned men into mindless beasts and drove them to kill and even cannibalize their victims.

“Holy crap!” I exclaimed as I finished reading the last page in the binder. “This is even better than I thought! I wonder what that Wembly guy wrote in his diary!”

It was getting late, so I decided to put off reading the diary for another day. I picked up my mask and looked it over, admiring it for both its craftsmanship and its history. “You just might be the coolest thing I’ll ever own,” I said to it as I caressed its cheek.

I looked into the glass eyes, and maybe it was a trick of the light, or maybe it was the lateness of the hour playing tricks with my mind, but I could have sworn those eyes, those glass eyes, looked back at me.

\*\*\*\*

I awoke the next morning to my girlfriend letting herself into my apartment. Her key clicked in the lock, and the door squeaked noisily as she opened it.

“Wake up sleepyhead!” she called.

I sat up and groaned in response as I rubbed the sleep out of my eyes. I checked the clock on my nightstand, saw the time, and got annoyed. “It’s seven a.m. on a Saturday!”

“We have plan’s remember?” she called out. “We’re supposed to . . . what is this?” she asked. Her tone changed from businesslike to pure excitement.

I stepped out of my bedroom clad in nothing but my night pants. She was excitedly holding up the wolf mask and admiring it. “It’s a cursed wolf mask,” I replied with a yawn. “It’s the centerpiece of my Halloween costume this year.”

“It’s looks so real,” she said admiringly, then her expression darkened and she put the mask down on the table. “Did you say ‘cursed’?” she sharply inquired.

“Yeah,” I yawned again. “It’s almost a thousand years old. The documents it came with say that a bunch of its previous owners went psycho and started killing people.”

“And you bought it?” she practically shrieked. “And you’re going to wear it?”

I filled the coffee maker and turned it on. “Don’t tell me you believe in magic, voodoo, curses, and all that nonsense,” I replied tiredly.

She took pause at that. I knew her answer, it was a major point of agreement between us. What science can’t explain either isn’t real, or just hasn’t been properly explained yet. Nothing is supernatural.

She finally replied. It’s just . . .” she paused. “If a bunch of people who owned it really did turn into psycho killers, there’s gotta be something there.”

I poured a cup of black coffee from the still brewing pot and took a sip. It was too hot but I didn’t care. “Sure there is,” I replied. “Social contagion. People believe it’s cursed, so they respond as though it’s cursed. It’s nothing special.”

It must have made sense to her, because he whole attitude changed again. “Have you tried it on yet?” she asked with a slight smile, her fear replaced with the admiration and curiosity she had when she first laid eyes on the mask.

It struck me that I hadn’t, so I picked it up, looked my girlfriend in the eyes, said “Jesus Christ” in a mocking tone, and put it on. It felt . . . perfect, as though it were made just for me. It slipped over my head easily and seemed to snug down to a perfect form fit. It had no odor, and I could see clearly with a full field of view through the glass eyes. “Not until just now,” I replied teasingly.

“EEEEK!” she shrieked.

“What?” I asked, alarmed, turning my head rapidly to see what had so alarmed her.

“The mouth moved when you talked!” she squealed. “It moved, and it moved in a perfect match for your words!”

I cocked my head to the side and looked at her quizzically. “For real?” I asked. It’s moving with my mouth?”

“Yes!’ she said excitedly. “Go see in the mirror!”

I did. I spoke. “Abracadabra, hocus pokus, jiggedy jokeus!” I said to my reflection.

Sure enough, the mouth moved in a lupine imitation of my own mouth movements. The movement were so well synced that I could swear I even saw the lips move although I knew it to be impossible. I took the mask off and admired it with the fattest grin of all time on my face.

“That’s amazing!” I exclaimed. “That old witch was a real master! I didn’t know people even knew how to make a mask’s mouth move in the twelfth century!?

“I know right?” My girlfriend, Tiffany said with as much excitement as I felt. “You’re going to have an amazing Halloween costume this year!”

I removed the mask, smiled at her, an nodded my head in affirmation.

“Just one thing,” she said with a hint of confusion. “What’s with that thing you said before you put the mask on?”

It took me a moment to remember what she was talking about. “Oh!” I snapped my fingers as I remembered. “There was a silly little list of rules, I was mocking them.” I grabbed the folder of provenance and flipped to the page with the rules on it. “See?” I said, pointing at the small passage. “Four ridiculous rules.”

Tiffany read them quickly and looked at me with a touch of confusion. “People actually believed this crap?” she said incredulously.

“I know, right?” I laughed.

She laughed with me for a bit, then stopped suddenly and glared at me. “Wait a minute,” she said sternly. “How much did you pay for this mask anyway?”

\*\*\*\*\*

The next few days were perfectly ordinary until the seventeenth. That was the day I finished assembling my costume, and one of two full moons in a row this year. I remember bringing home a pair of retro ripped jeans to go with the red plaid flannel shirt, theater prop quality werewolf gloves, complete with a set of long claws tipping the fingers, and other clothing reminiscent of an 80’s era movie werewolf.

The sun had set hours earlier. I obtained the pants shopping with Tiffany after our dinner date, and I was absolutely thrilled. I couldn’t wait to try it all on and see how it went together.

It was glorious. I donned the outfit, then slowly, almost ritualistically lowered the mask over my head to complete the costume.

It was like magic in the mirror. I looked myself over, and I loved what I saw. I looked like something out of Teen Wolf, only better. Sure, I could have achieved something very much like it far more cheaply. I could have just gone to Spirit Halloween, bought a costume or a rubber mask, and went to Walmart for finishing touches and adjustments, and done a satisfactory job for under $200, but that’s not what I wanted. I wanted the rizz. I wanted to stand out among all the other costumed partygoers at the fraternity Halloween party. This costume absolutely did it, and I couldn’t have been happier.

In my ecstasy, I noticed a . . . feeling running through my body, as though there was a kind of . . . energy coursing through me. It wasn’t as simple as “a burning in my blood” or “my nerves were on fire”. No, it was a feeling of power, as though I was still myself, but also something . . . more.

I felt as though I could toss four men over my shoulders and run a marathon. I felt as though I could get in a bar fight and kick every ass in the place. I felt . . . godly.

I removed the mask after a few minutes and inspected my outfit without it. I felt normal again, and, somehow, it felt wrong. I felt like my ordinary self was somehow no longer enough. I felt incomplete, like I removed a piece of myself when I removed the mask.

“Stop being ridiculous,” I told my reflection. “You’re letting myth and superstition influence you. You’re better than that!”

And yet, I felt like I was lying to myself. Right there, staring at my reflection, I felt like the man looking back at me wasn’t really me, like something unknowable was missing. I looked at my reflection and it felt as though I was looking at someone else, someone I didn’t really know, and who could never truly know me in return.

I shook my head to clear the strange thoughts and center myself again. “Pictures!” I reminded myself. “Tiffany wanted pictures so she could put together something complementary.”

I took out my phone and held it up to the mirror to take a picture, and paused. I couldn’t send her a picture like this. My costume was incomplete. I needed to wear the mask or else my costume wasn’t really my costume, and how could she possibly match her costume to mine if I sent her an incomplete photo?

I picked up the mask to put it on and paused. I paused to look at it, to admire it. I looked into its lifelike glass eyes. I stroked its fur as though it were a living thing. “You’re mine,” I told it in a low, almost silent voice. “You’re mine, and I am your master!”

I continued to stare into those perfectly crafted glass eyes, losing myself in them, and wanting nothing in the world so much as I wanted to put that mask on and forget myself. Slowly, almost robotically, I raised it up and gently lowered it over my head.

I felt a rush of euphoria, like what I felt earlier only a hundred times more potent. I took my phone in hand, opened the camera app, raised it, and snapped a single picture of myself in the mirror.

I opened text messaging, selected Tiffany, attached the message, and typed the following text: “It’s complete, and now I’m complete.”

I hit send. I looked into the mirror and met my own gaze staring back at me through those glass eyes that had no business looking as real and alive as they did, and then the world went blank.

\*\*\*\*\*

I awoke the next day with no idea where I was. I opened my eyes only to be greeted by the rising sun in the middle of a forest.

A forest?

There was a forest outside of town, but it wasn’t exactly a short walk if you catch my drift.

It was easily a half an hour’s drive once you got out of town, and not exactly the kind of thing you just get up and walk to like you’re taking the dog out to the local community park.

I woke up there, and not on the edge either, but well inside the borders, and I was covered in a red, sticky substance that could only be blood, and my stomach hurt like I had gotten drunk and did my best to eat my own body weight at the local Asian buffet.

“What the . . .” I trailed off as I looked at my hands and arms and was taken aback by the dried red and brown goop covering them. I looked down at myself and saw that I was still in my costume, and my clothing was utterly ruined, covered in a deep red liquid that was surely blood.

I realized that I was still wearing the mask, and I ripped it off of my head in a panic. My breath came in great heaves, uncontrollable, and my head began to swim as I hyperventilated.

I closed my eyes and forced myself to calm down. I made myself breathe slower, and slower, and slower still until I finally brought it down to normal. I focused on my heart rate, and gradually brought it down with a blend of deep breathing and mind clearing.

Once I had myself physically under control, I looked at myself again.

How did I get covered in such a disgustingly massive amount of blood? Why did my stomach hurt so much? How did the wolf mask manage to stay clean when the rest of me was drenched in filth? And why did I-

My stomach finally gave up and rebelled. I dropped the wolf mask and fell to my knees retching and vomiting a copious amount of stomach contents. I vomited even as I found myself losing my breath and desperately wanting to breathe. I vomited even as my lack of breath began to make my head swim. I vomited even as my vision blurred and blackened at the edges.

Then I was able to breathe again. I took in great, gasping gulps of air. I I heaved and panted as I sought to restore my oxygen supply.

Then I vomited again.

If possible, I can say that the second round was worse than the third. It didn’t hit me so continuously as to cut me off from breathing completely like the first round did, but it did let me get just enough breath to barely subsist before striking again until I thought I would surely pass out, and then it subsided just long enough to tease me again before taking over and nearly choking me to death over and over and over again until I wished that I could just die and get it over with,

When I was finally finished, my stomach felt better, but there was glistening pile of partially digested stomach contents all over the ground in front of me. I wish I could say that I knew what I was looking at, but it was all so thoroughly masticated that I couldn’t hope pick one bit from another. All I knew was that none of it looked cooked, and I didn’t see anything that could pass for a vegetable anywhere in the nasty mix.

My stomach felt better though.

I picked up my mask, chose a random direction, and began to walk. I must have chosen well, because after only two hours, I came across a road.

I’m not ignorant. I’ve driven in and out of town plenty of times. I know my way around in town and around the outskirts of my hometown. That’s why I knew that I needed to go left once I reached this road if I wanted to get home. How long would it take? Fucked if I know. All that mattered was I was going the right direction, and the rest would fall into place one way or another.

And fall into place it did. Less than an hour of walking later, A random pickup truck pulled over. The driver listened to my story, and told me to hop in the bed of his truck and he’d take me into town. I did it gratefully, and he was as good as his word, better even. He dropped me off outside my apartment building, told me to stay off the drugs, and went on his merry way.

I went inside, took the elevator to my floor, opened my door without needing to use my key, which was also weird since I never, ever, EVER left my apartment without locking it, and immediately rushed to the shower so I could get clean and feel human again.

I was brushing my teeth for the third time when I heard my phone ringing. It was on the floor, pushed up against the wall under the sink. Why? I don’t know. But I found it, pulled it out, and answered the call.

“Where have you been?” Tiffany practically shrieked in my ear. I’ve been calling and texting all night and I haven’t heard a word from you! If you didn’t pick up the phone this time I was going to call the cops to make sure you weren’t dead!”

On the one hand, it felt surreal being yelled at so mundanely after the freaky mystery I woke up to. On the other, what in the ever-living hell was going on?

I let my girlfriend yell for awhile until she was all shouted out. Then I responded. “I don’t know where I was last night,” I told her in a shaky voice. “One minute I was home, the next I was waking up in the middle of nowhere covered in blood.”

This set off another wave of panicked screeching that eventually settled down into sobbing and expressions of gratitude that I was alright. She told me she was coming right over and hung up before I could protest.

I had a very, very bad feeling about her coming over.

\*\*\*\*\*

It literally took all day to get Tiffany settled down and comfortable with the fact that that, in spite of everything, I was alright. I didn’t tell her about how my body had violently purged my stomach of an inhuman amount of raw flesh shortly after waking up. I was already washed up, and my bloody costume was in the wash getting as clean as I could hope for it to be.

It was actually the laundry that got her settled down. She volunteered to take my costume out of the dryer, and was absolutely delighted to see that I had added to it by dying in a bunch of red and brown staining. “It’s actually looks like you ripped something apart and ate it!” she said excitedly. “You’re so good at making Halloween costumes!”

“Yeah . . .” I said slowly before trailing off. “I modified it . . .”

She didn’t give me a chance to finish my words or my thoughts before she jumped me. Perhaps if she hadn’t been so excited and relieved that I was safe and healthy, things would have turned out differently. Perhaps if our intimate life wasn’t so . . . frequent and vigorous, everything would have turned out differently.

As it was, I succumbed to her passion, and we fell asleep in each other’s arms for an afternoon nap.

\*\*\*\*\*

I awoke before Tiffany did, and I went to the living room to examine the mask. I felt scared holding it. It felt wrong to put my hands upon that artifact, as though I was touching a power I could not hope to control or comprehend.

I turned it over, and over, and over again, examining it to the finest detail.

Why did this mask, out of everything I wore last night, not have a single drop of blood on it? Why was the last thing I could remember putting it on and taking a selfie?

That thought triggered something in me, and I took out my phone. I didn’t have it with me in the forest, and I couldn’t remember checking the picture I took or sending it to Tiffany.

I opened the photos and looked at the last picture I took.

I don’t know what I was expecting. Maybe a photo of myself mid-metamorphosis. Mayne I thought I’d catch myself becoming something other than, well, me. What I actually saw was me, in my costume, with my phone in my hand.

I looked at the picture again, not really believing that it could be so mundane, and I thought I could see something . . . different in those lifelike glass eyes, I though that maybe, just maybe there was a hint of something in there that was not only me. But no. It couldn’t be. The supernatural isn’t real after all. It’s all hokum. Bunk. Small-minded garbage that enlightened people like me didn’t believe in.

The sun had set. It wasn’t down for long, but it was the second day of the rarest kind of blue moon event, the kind where the full moon happens two days in a row. I looked into the eyes of the mask, this perfect, masterfully crafted mask, lifted it up, and lowered it onto my head.

\*\*\*\*\*

I woke up the next morning, the nineteenth of October, a mere week ago to the most horrifying sight of my life.

I awoke on the floor of my own apartment, but once again, I was covered in blood and filth.

“How?” I screamed in horror, not understanding where the ungodly mess had come from.

My stomach was killing me. I rushed to my bathroom and barely made it to the toilet before my stomach decided to evacuate its contents, then and keep evacuating itself even when there was nothing but water and bile left to push out. It went on, and on, and on, until I wished I would just die rather than endure another moment of such violent illness.

I flushed the toilet whenever I had the presence of mind to do so without checking to see what had come out of me. I had seen what came out the day before, and I didn’t want to see it again. Perhaps that’s why I failed to recognize any of the bits and parts, the solid matter mixed in with the wretched fluids that erupted from my stomach and out of my mouth.

Regardless, I was glued to the toilet until my stomach finally settled down after who-knows how long. Then I stripped my bloody clothing and took a shower so hot I felt like it might burn the skin from my bones, and I was okay with that.

I felt dirty inside and out. It was wrong. Wrong in every way. Down to my soul if I had believed it at the time, I felt wrong, dirty, and thoroughly corrupted.

I was in the shower for an hour, lost in feelings rather than thought. Wondering what had happened and how I managed to wind up covered in blood again in my own apartment. It was only when I finally shut off the water and was halfway through drying off that it hit me.

Tiffany!”

I screamed, and I ran to my bedroom.

I burst into my bedroom, and was greeted by the most horrific mess I could possibly imagine. The entire room was splattered with blood and viscera. Not a surface was spared as at least some red drops or other . . . scraps was on every surface, every knick-knack, every everything in the room

My screams only got louder and more insistent as I scanned the room and found the head of Tifany, my beautiful Tiffany, beloved girlfriend of three years, on a pillow, fully detached from her body, lifeless eyes staring off into the void. I hurled myself to it, reaching desperately, not willing to believe in what I was seeing.

I picked it up and stared into her sightless eyes, and burst into tears. “Tiffany,” I sobbed. “How? Why?”

I looked around and took the horrific scene in. I recognized the various parts of my beloved scattered around the room. Legs and arms tossed about, bones scattered all over, looking like they had been gnawed upon by a great beast. And not one of her internal organs to be seen.

I remembered how upset my stomach was when I woke up, and how distended it appeared before I threw up the contents in a prolonged, and violent fit. How much of her had I simply flushed away, not knowing what I was doing because I refused to just open my eyes as I vomited up my sick?

I dropped Tiffany’s head back onto my bed and scrambled to the living room. I picked up the diary of Archibald Wembly and read it thoroughly. Much of it was a repeat of what I had already read before in the other provenance, until I got to the end. Here is what is read:

*I should have listened to the rules. I should have learned from the mistakes of others. I didn’t, and now I am paying the price for my foolishness. The mask is gone, but I can feel it’s influence on me even as I write these words.  I blacked out again last night, and when I awoke this morning, my family was dead, ripped apart from some foul beast. Every last one of them. My wife Abigail, and the children George, Franklin, Erin, and Caleb. All of them were torn apart. Only I was spared, and I was covered in such an amount of blood and gore that it could only have come from many animals, of a family of people. I ignored the rules. I wore the mask at night. I wore it on the full moon. It amused me to do so, and I did it without once invoking the name of Christ for protection.*

*I was a fool, and my family has paid the price for my pride and lack of faith. The mask is gone, but I can still feel it within me somehow, as though it has become a part of me. I do not know what the future will bring, but I fear it will be more bloodshed, and it will be me in some beastly form, rending apart my fellow man in bestial glee.*

*I only hope that someone stops me before I go too far.*

*God help me and spare the innocent.*

I put the diary down and sat back stunned, then it dawned on me: Where was the wolf mask?

I tore my apartment searching for it, I really did, but I could not find it. Still, I can feel its presence, like it’s lost, but also not. It’s like it’s here with me even though I cannot see it.

Today is only five days until Halloween. The sun has set, and I feel . . . strong, stronger than I have any right to feel. My dead girlfriend remains rotting in my bedroom, and it smells horrible. The neighbors are sure to complain soon.

I don’t understand what’s going on, but I do know this: I never should have bought that mask, and once I bought it, I never should have broken the rules. How was I supposed to know it was a real cursed object? There’s no science that can explain curses, real, magical curses. Magic isn’t real, right?

Who am I kidding. I believe in magic . . . now. But I came to believe too late. Too late to save my beloved Tiffany, and too late to save myself.

I need to flee. I need to get away from here, as soon as possible. I can feel the beast inside of me, and it wants to get out. I need to get as far away from people as possible, to disappear and never be seen again.

But I’m hungry, and there’s a great nightclub not far from here, and the night is young.

Perhaps I’ll stop in for a bite to eat before I begin my journey.",1,1729994413.0,DJ_Storytime,0,1.0,False
1gd0lu7,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1gd0lu7/the_mask_of_the_loup_garou/,The Mask of the Loup Garou,"I never should have entered that antique store, and I definitely shouldn’t have bought that mask. Gannon’s is known for buying and selling rare and unique antiques, and I wanted to impress my friends with a unique Halloween costume this year, so I thought the perfect solution would be to get my hands on a genuine antique costume, one of those strange, ultra creepy ones from the 1800’s or earlier. Sure, it would cost me, but can you really put a price on standing out?

The bell over the door jingled dully as I opened the door and walked in. The proprietor, and gray, bent over man with a thick, bushy beard and thick, round rimmed spectacles who was ninety if he was a day casually acknowledged me and went back to the ancient book he was examining.

The store wasn’t big, but it had space, only every last bit of that space was filled with relics of bygone eras. Not the usual furniture, silverware, and paintings of your typical antique shop. No. Everything here had a story, and as such, everything here commanded a premium price.

There was an old cavalry saber that was known to have killed no less than seven men in the Civil War. It even still had flecks of blood from its victims spattered along the blade and hilt. There was an old rope noose that had supposedly been used to hang a witch during the Salem Witch Trials. There was an ancient tome with strange symbols on the cover that once belonged to a European court wizard. There was even a hat that once belonged to a certain H. H. Holmes. The stories attached to each item were historical, mystical, and often macabre. And I loved it.

I didn’t believe in magic or mysticism, angels and demons, or anything else beyond what science could explain. That didn’t mean that I wasn’t fascinated by stories involving them though. How much more interesting would the world be if the supernatural actually did exist? It was a tantalizing proposition, and it’s why I had to buy it as soon as I saw it.

It was a wolf mask. Not a mask made to look like a wolf, but a mask made out of the skin and fur of a wolf’s head and neck. It was a masterful work of preservation and artistry that looked as alive on display that day as the creature itself must have looked in life.

I picked it up carefully, turning it over and around in my hand so I could see it from every angle. The work was beyond fine. I couldn’t even see the seams and threads that held it together. Not a single hair seemed to be missing from the thick, gray fur. The teeth were real, and firmly fixed into the snout. I assumed they were so well-done because the original jaws had been used to form the snarling mouth. The eyes were glass, and far too lifelike for such an aged item. Perfect replicas of thin glass set in the eye sockets.

I had to have it.

I checked the story card next to the original display. The price was outrageous, but I didn’t care. Not only was the mask perfect, but the supposed history couldn’t have been more ideal for the season.

It read simply: *Enchanted mask made from the preserved skin of a Loup Garou slain in Burgundy, France in 1137 AD. Do not wear at night.*

“Oh hohohoho,” I grunted excitedly. “I have plans for you!”

I brought the mask and story card to the checkout. Old man Gannon checked the item, and me with more scrutiny than I was really comfortable with before speaking. “Heed the warning boy,” he said sternly. “It wouldn’t do for you to tempt fate.”

I chuckled, ignoring the fact that he called me “boy”. He was probably the oldest man in town, so everyone was “boy” or “girl” to him. “You don’t have to worry about me,” I assured him. “You got any more documentation that goes with this? If I’m going to fork over two-thousand dollars for a mask, I want as much provenance as I can get.”

Old man Gannon grunted derisively. “Of course I have documents that go with it. A fair few actually. Be sure that you read them and take proper precautions.”

“Of course,” I replied seriously, lying through my teeth. The supernatural is not real after all. It’s a myth, legend, just stories. What this mask was, to me, was the foundation of the absolute best Halloween costume I had ever concocted. Sure, a werewolf costume wouldn’t be especially unique, but with that mask, it would be the most frighteningly real one our town had ever seen.

The old man went into the back room and quickly returned with a binder filled with documents in protectors, and a small leatherbound journal. “These are the provenance,” he declared. “The journal is of particular interest as it belonged to a previous owner of the mask, a Mr. Archibald Wembly of London, wrote it in the years Fifteen-Twelve through Fifteen-Fourteen. He went mad after wearing the mask and killed two people before he was cut down in the street. Witnesses swore that he looked more animal than man before he died. The police report is document one-hundred-twenty-three.”

I set the mask on the counter and quickly leafed through the documents. There were originals, and English translations for each. “All this and you’re only charging two-thousand dollars?” I asked incredulously. “Such a unique relic with this much provenance together . . . it has to be worth more.”

Old man Gannon nodded his head. “Yes. Yes it is,” he confirmed. “I actually paid more for it myself, but . . .” he trailed off. “Something about that particular item unsettles me. I wish to be rid of it sooner rather than later, so I’m taking a loss for my own peace of mind.”

I didn’t question it. If this old man was willing to let his superstitions be my gain, I was perfectly fine with it. I paid for the mask and happily took it home.

Looking back, I should never have been so sure of myself. Nor so proud. Nor so certain about how the world works. The events that followed changed my perspective of the nature of reality itself, and I don’t think I’ll ever be able to go back to how I was.

In my defense, and also to remove any possibility that I can claim ignorance if I get desperate enough, I need to confess that I did read the provenance documents right away. I didn’t read them to get any warnings to heed, or as some kind of user manual. I read them to learn the history of my beautiful, terrifyingly creepy wolf mask. Having the story at the tip of my tongue top tell at will would truly be the icing on what I knew would be a most impressive, and frightening cake, or, rather, costume.

The earliest documents were all about the supposed Loup Garou that was terrorizing the Burgundian countryside, and the hunt to put an end to the gruesome string of murders it was blamed for. Document twenty was a notice celebrating that the foul beast had finally been killed and skinned by a visiting huntsman who only asked to be allowed to keep the skin and take it back to him home as his reward. The local ruler, only too happy to get off so cheaply, permitted it.

The huntsman wrote that he brought the hide to a supposed witch named Lucia, who lived alone on a mountain named Muzsla in modern day Slovakia. He paid her handsomely with instructions to use the hide to create an item of power. One that would make him strong.

Apparently, she obliged, making the wolf mask, and he was happy, but it came with a strict set of rules. 1. Never wear the mask at night. 2. Never wear the mask on the day or night of the full moon. 3. Never wear the mask during the autumnal equinox. 4. Always invoke the name of Christ before donning the mask.

The man must have been wildly superstitious, because he followed the rules religiously. The following documents are filled with fanciful tales of the huntsman performing mighty deeds that led to him earning a minor lordship before retiring to administer his land holdings and eventually dying of old age.

What followed after was one document after another that spoke of the mask passing to a new owner who either did not read, or chose not to follow the rules, and how each one ultimately went mad, committing a varying number of murders, and being either killed during the apprehension, or executed for their crimes. It gained a reputation as a cursed item that turned men into mindless beasts and drove them to kill and even cannibalize their victims.

“Holy crap!” I exclaimed as I finished reading the last page in the binder. “This is even better than I thought! I wonder what that Wembly guy wrote in his diary!”

It was getting late, so I decided to put off reading the diary for another day. I picked up my mask and looked it over, admiring it for both its craftsmanship and its history. “You just might be the coolest thing I’ll ever own,” I said to it as I caressed its cheek.

I looked into the glass eyes, and maybe it was a trick of the light, or maybe it was the lateness of the hour playing tricks with my mind, but I could have sworn those eyes, those glass eyes, looked back at me.

\*\*\*\*

I awoke the next morning to my girlfriend letting herself into my apartment. Her key clicked in the lock, and the door squeaked noisily as she opened it.

“Wake up sleepyhead!” she called.

I sat up and groaned in response as I rubbed the sleep out of my eyes. I checked the clock on my nightstand, saw the time, and got annoyed. “It’s seven a.m. on a Saturday!”

“We have plan’s remember?” she called out. “We’re supposed to . . . what is this?” she asked. Her tone changed from businesslike to pure excitement.

I stepped out of my bedroom clad in nothing but my night pants. She was excitedly holding up the wolf mask and admiring it. “It’s a cursed wolf mask,” I replied with a yawn. “It’s the centerpiece of my Halloween costume this year.”

“It’s looks so real,” she said admiringly, then her expression darkened and she put the mask down on the table. “Did you say ‘cursed’?” she sharply inquired.

“Yeah,” I yawned again. “It’s almost a thousand years old. The documents it came with say that a bunch of its previous owners went psycho and started killing people.”

“And you bought it?” she practically shrieked. “And you’re going to wear it?”

I filled the coffee maker and turned it on. “Don’t tell me you believe in magic, voodoo, curses, and all that nonsense,” I replied tiredly.

She took pause at that. I knew her answer, it was a major point of agreement between us. What science can’t explain either isn’t real, or just hasn’t been properly explained yet. Nothing is supernatural.

She finally replied. It’s just . . .” she paused. “If a bunch of people who owned it really did turn into psycho killers, there’s gotta be something there.”

I poured a cup of black coffee from the still brewing pot and took a sip. It was too hot but I didn’t care. “Sure there is,” I replied. “Social contagion. People believe it’s cursed, so they respond as though it’s cursed. It’s nothing special.”

It must have made sense to her, because he whole attitude changed again. “Have you tried it on yet?” she asked with a slight smile, her fear replaced with the admiration and curiosity she had when she first laid eyes on the mask.

It struck me that I hadn’t, so I picked it up, looked my girlfriend in the eyes, said “Jesus Christ” in a mocking tone, and put it on. It felt . . . perfect, as though it were made just for me. It slipped over my head easily and seemed to snug down to a perfect form fit. It had no odor, and I could see clearly with a full field of view through the glass eyes. “Not until just now,” I replied teasingly.

“EEEEK!” she shrieked.

“What?” I asked, alarmed, turning my head rapidly to see what had so alarmed her.

“The mouth moved when you talked!” she squealed. “It moved, and it moved in a perfect match for your words!”

I cocked my head to the side and looked at her quizzically. “For real?” I asked. It’s moving with my mouth?”

“Yes!’ she said excitedly. “Go see in the mirror!”

I did. I spoke. “Abracadabra, hocus pokus, jiggedy jokeus!” I said to my reflection.

Sure enough, the mouth moved in a lupine imitation of my own mouth movements. The movement were so well synced that I could swear I even saw the lips move although I knew it to be impossible. I took the mask off and admired it with the fattest grin of all time on my face.

“That’s amazing!” I exclaimed. “That old witch was a real master! I didn’t know people even knew how to make a mask’s mouth move in the twelfth century!?

“I know right?” My girlfriend, Tiffany said with as much excitement as I felt. “You’re going to have an amazing Halloween costume this year!”

I removed the mask, smiled at her, an nodded my head in affirmation.

“Just one thing,” she said with a hint of confusion. “What’s with that thing you said before you put the mask on?”

It took me a moment to remember what she was talking about. “Oh!” I snapped my fingers as I remembered. “There was a silly little list of rules, I was mocking them.” I grabbed the folder of provenance and flipped to the page with the rules on it. “See?” I said, pointing at the small passage. “Four ridiculous rules.”

Tiffany read them quickly and looked at me with a touch of confusion. “People actually believed this crap?” she said incredulously.

“I know, right?” I laughed.

She laughed with me for a bit, then stopped suddenly and glared at me. “Wait a minute,” she said sternly. “How much did you pay for this mask anyway?”

\*\*\*\*\*

The next few days were perfectly ordinary until the seventeenth. That was the day I finished assembling my costume, and one of two full moons in a row this year. I remember bringing home a pair of retro ripped jeans to go with the red plaid flannel shirt, theater prop quality werewolf gloves, complete with a set of long claws tipping the fingers, and other clothing reminiscent of an 80’s era movie werewolf.

The sun had set hours earlier. I obtained the pants shopping with Tiffany after our dinner date, and I was absolutely thrilled. I couldn’t wait to try it all on and see how it went together.

It was glorious. I donned the outfit, then slowly, almost ritualistically lowered the mask over my head to complete the costume.

It was like magic in the mirror. I looked myself over, and I loved what I saw. I looked like something out of Teen Wolf, only better. Sure, I could have achieved something very much like it far more cheaply. I could have just gone to Spirit Halloween, bought a costume or a rubber mask, and went to Walmart for finishing touches and adjustments, and done a satisfactory job for under $200, but that’s not what I wanted. I wanted the rizz. I wanted to stand out among all the other costumed partygoers at the fraternity Halloween party. This costume absolutely did it, and I couldn’t have been happier.

In my ecstasy, I noticed a . . . feeling running through my body, as though there was a kind of . . . energy coursing through me. It wasn’t as simple as “a burning in my blood” or “my nerves were on fire”. No, it was a feeling of power, as though I was still myself, but also something . . . more.

I felt as though I could toss four men over my shoulders and run a marathon. I felt as though I could get in a bar fight and kick every ass in the place. I felt . . . godly.

I removed the mask after a few minutes and inspected my outfit without it. I felt normal again, and, somehow, it felt wrong. I felt like my ordinary self was somehow no longer enough. I felt incomplete, like I removed a piece of myself when I removed the mask.

“Stop being ridiculous,” I told my reflection. “You’re letting myth and superstition influence you. You’re better than that!”

And yet, I felt like I was lying to myself. Right there, staring at my reflection, I felt like the man looking back at me wasn’t really me, like something unknowable was missing. I looked at my reflection and it felt as though I was looking at someone else, someone I didn’t really know, and who could never truly know me in return.

I shook my head to clear the strange thoughts and center myself again. “Pictures!” I reminded myself. “Tiffany wanted pictures so she could put together something complementary.”

I took out my phone and held it up to the mirror to take a picture, and paused. I couldn’t send her a picture like this. My costume was incomplete. I needed to wear the mask or else my costume wasn’t really my costume, and how could she possibly match her costume to mine if I sent her an incomplete photo?

I picked up the mask to put it on and paused. I paused to look at it, to admire it. I looked into its lifelike glass eyes. I stroked its fur as though it were a living thing. “You’re mine,” I told it in a low, almost silent voice. “You’re mine, and I am your master!”

I continued to stare into those perfectly crafted glass eyes, losing myself in them, and wanting nothing in the world so much as I wanted to put that mask on and forget myself. Slowly, almost robotically, I raised it up and gently lowered it over my head.

I felt a rush of euphoria, like what I felt earlier only a hundred times more potent. I took my phone in hand, opened the camera app, raised it, and snapped a single picture of myself in the mirror.

I opened text messaging, selected Tiffany, attached the message, and typed the following text: “It’s complete, and now I’m complete.”

I hit send. I looked into the mirror and met my own gaze staring back at me through those glass eyes that had no business looking as real and alive as they did, and then the world went blank.

\*\*\*\*\*

I awoke the next day with no idea where I was. I opened my eyes only to be greeted by the rising sun in the middle of a forest.

A forest?

There was a forest outside of town, but it wasn’t exactly a short walk if you catch my drift.

It was easily a half an hour’s drive once you got out of town, and not exactly the kind of thing you just get up and walk to like you’re taking the dog out to the local community park.

I woke up there, and not on the edge either, but well inside the borders, and I was covered in a red, sticky substance that could only be blood, and my stomach hurt like I had gotten drunk and did my best to eat my own body weight at the local Asian buffet.

“What the . . .” I trailed off as I looked at my hands and arms and was taken aback by the dried red and brown goop covering them. I looked down at myself and saw that I was still in my costume, and my clothing was utterly ruined, covered in a deep red liquid that was surely blood.

I realized that I was still wearing the mask, and I ripped it off of my head in a panic. My breath came in great heaves, uncontrollable, and my head began to swim as I hyperventilated.

I closed my eyes and forced myself to calm down. I made myself breathe slower, and slower, and slower still until I finally brought it down to normal. I focused on my heart rate, and gradually brought it down with a blend of deep breathing and mind clearing.

Once I had myself physically under control, I looked at myself again.

How did I get covered in such a disgustingly massive amount of blood? Why did my stomach hurt so much? How did the wolf mask manage to stay clean when the rest of me was drenched in filth? And why did I-

My stomach finally gave up and rebelled. I dropped the wolf mask and fell to my knees retching and vomiting a copious amount of stomach contents. I vomited even as I found myself losing my breath and desperately wanting to breathe. I vomited even as my lack of breath began to make my head swim. I vomited even as my vision blurred and blackened at the edges.

Then I was able to breathe again. I took in great, gasping gulps of air. I I heaved and panted as I sought to restore my oxygen supply.

Then I vomited again.

If possible, I can say that the second round was worse than the third. It didn’t hit me so continuously as to cut me off from breathing completely like the first round did, but it did let me get just enough breath to barely subsist before striking again until I thought I would surely pass out, and then it subsided just long enough to tease me again before taking over and nearly choking me to death over and over and over again until I wished that I could just die and get it over with,

When I was finally finished, my stomach felt better, but there was glistening pile of partially digested stomach contents all over the ground in front of me. I wish I could say that I knew what I was looking at, but it was all so thoroughly masticated that I couldn’t hope pick one bit from another. All I knew was that none of it looked cooked, and I didn’t see anything that could pass for a vegetable anywhere in the nasty mix.

My stomach felt better though.

I picked up my mask, chose a random direction, and began to walk. I must have chosen well, because after only two hours, I came across a road.

I’m not ignorant. I’ve driven in and out of town plenty of times. I know my way around in town and around the outskirts of my hometown. That’s why I knew that I needed to go left once I reached this road if I wanted to get home. How long would it take? Fucked if I know. All that mattered was I was going the right direction, and the rest would fall into place one way or another.

And fall into place it did. Less than an hour of walking later, A random pickup truck pulled over. The driver listened to my story, and told me to hop in the bed of his truck and he’d take me into town. I did it gratefully, and he was as good as his word, better even. He dropped me off outside my apartment building, told me to stay off the drugs, and went on his merry way.

I went inside, took the elevator to my floor, opened my door without needing to use my key, which was also weird since I never, ever, EVER left my apartment without locking it, and immediately rushed to the shower so I could get clean and feel human again.

I was brushing my teeth for the third time when I heard my phone ringing. It was on the floor, pushed up against the wall under the sink. Why? I don’t know. But I found it, pulled it out, and answered the call.

“Where have you been?” Tiffany practically shrieked in my ear. I’ve been calling and texting all night and I haven’t heard a word from you! If you didn’t pick up the phone this time I was going to call the cops to make sure you weren’t dead!”

On the one hand, it felt surreal being yelled at so mundanely after the freaky mystery I woke up to. On the other, what in the ever-living hell was going on?

I let my girlfriend yell for awhile until she was all shouted out. Then I responded. “I don’t know where I was last night,” I told her in a shaky voice. “One minute I was home, the next I was waking up in the middle of nowhere covered in blood.”

This set off another wave of panicked screeching that eventually settled down into sobbing and expressions of gratitude that I was alright. She told me she was coming right over and hung up before I could protest.

I had a very, very bad feeling about her coming over.

\*\*\*\*\*

It literally took all day to get Tiffany settled down and comfortable with the fact that that, in spite of everything, I was alright. I didn’t tell her about how my body had violently purged my stomach of an inhuman amount of raw flesh shortly after waking up. I was already washed up, and my bloody costume was in the wash getting as clean as I could hope for it to be.

It was actually the laundry that got her settled down. She volunteered to take my costume out of the dryer, and was absolutely delighted to see that I had added to it by dying in a bunch of red and brown staining. “It’s actually looks like you ripped something apart and ate it!” she said excitedly. “You’re so good at making Halloween costumes!”

“Yeah . . .” I said slowly before trailing off. “I modified it . . .”

She didn’t give me a chance to finish my words or my thoughts before she jumped me. Perhaps if she hadn’t been so excited and relieved that I was safe and healthy, things would have turned out differently. Perhaps if our intimate life wasn’t so . . . frequent and vigorous, everything would have turned out differently.

As it was, I succumbed to her passion, and we fell asleep in each other’s arms for an afternoon nap.

\*\*\*\*\*

I awoke before Tiffany did, and I went to the living room to examine the mask. I felt scared holding it. It felt wrong to put my hands upon that artifact, as though I was touching a power I could not hope to control or comprehend.

I turned it over, and over, and over again, examining it to the finest detail.

Why did this mask, out of everything I wore last night, not have a single drop of blood on it? Why was the last thing I could remember putting it on and taking a selfie?

That thought triggered something in me, and I took out my phone. I didn’t have it with me in the forest, and I couldn’t remember checking the picture I took or sending it to Tiffany.

I opened the photos and looked at the last picture I took.

I don’t know what I was expecting. Maybe a photo of myself mid-metamorphosis. Mayne I thought I’d catch myself becoming something other than, well, me. What I actually saw was me, in my costume, with my phone in my hand.

I looked at the picture again, not really believing that it could be so mundane, and I thought I could see something . . . different in those lifelike glass eyes, I though that maybe, just maybe there was a hint of something in there that was not only me. But no. It couldn’t be. The supernatural isn’t real after all. It’s all hokum. Bunk. Small-minded garbage that enlightened people like me didn’t believe in.

The sun had set. It wasn’t down for long, but it was the second day of the rarest kind of blue moon event, the kind where the full moon happens two days in a row. I looked into the eyes of the mask, this perfect, masterfully crafted mask, lifted it up, and lowered it onto my head.

\*\*\*\*\*

I woke up the next morning, the nineteenth of October, a mere week ago to the most horrifying sight of my life.

I awoke on the floor of my own apartment, but once again, I was covered in blood and filth.

“How?” I screamed in horror, not understanding where the ungodly mess had come from.

My stomach was killing me. I rushed to my bathroom and barely made it to the toilet before my stomach decided to evacuate its contents, then and keep evacuating itself even when there was nothing but water and bile left to push out. It went on, and on, and on, until I wished I would just die rather than endure another moment of such violent illness.

I flushed the toilet whenever I had the presence of mind to do so without checking to see what had come out of me. I had seen what came out the day before, and I didn’t want to see it again. Perhaps that’s why I failed to recognize any of the bits and parts, the solid matter mixed in with the wretched fluids that erupted from my stomach and out of my mouth.

Regardless, I was glued to the toilet until my stomach finally settled down after who-knows how long. Then I stripped my bloody clothing and took a shower so hot I felt like it might burn the skin from my bones, and I was okay with that.

I felt dirty inside and out. It was wrong. Wrong in every way. Down to my soul if I had believed it at the time, I felt wrong, dirty, and thoroughly corrupted.

I was in the shower for an hour, lost in feelings rather than thought. Wondering what had happened and how I managed to wind up covered in blood again in my own apartment. It was only when I finally shut off the water and was halfway through drying off that it hit me.

Tiffany!”

I screamed, and I ran to my bedroom.

I burst into my bedroom, and was greeted by the most horrific mess I could possibly imagine. The entire room was splattered with blood and viscera. Not a surface was spared as at least some red drops or other . . . scraps was on every surface, every knick-knack, every everything in the room

My screams only got louder and more insistent as I scanned the room and found the head of Tifany, my beautiful Tiffany, beloved girlfriend of three years, on a pillow, fully detached from her body, lifeless eyes staring off into the void. I hurled myself to it, reaching desperately, not willing to believe in what I was seeing.

I picked it up and stared into her sightless eyes, and burst into tears. “Tiffany,” I sobbed. “How? Why?”

I looked around and took the horrific scene in. I recognized the various parts of my beloved scattered around the room. Legs and arms tossed about, bones scattered all over, looking like they had been gnawed upon by a great beast. And not one of her internal organs to be seen.

I remembered how upset my stomach was when I woke up, and how distended it appeared before I threw up the contents in a prolonged, and violent fit. How much of her had I simply flushed away, not knowing what I was doing because I refused to just open my eyes as I vomited up my sick?

I dropped Tiffany’s head back onto my bed and scrambled to the living room. I picked up the diary of Archibald Wembly and read it thoroughly. Much of it was a repeat of what I had already read before in the other provenance, until I got to the end. Here is what is read:

*I should have listened to the rules. I should have learned from the mistakes of others. I didn’t, and now I am paying the price for my foolishness. The mask is gone, but I can feel it’s influence on me even as I write these words.  I blacked out again last night, and when I awoke this morning, my family was dead, ripped apart from some foul beast. Every last one of them. My wife Abigail, and the children George, Franklin, Erin, and Caleb. All of them were torn apart. Only I was spared, and I was covered in such an amount of blood and gore that it could only have come from many animals, of a family of people. I ignored the rules. I wore the mask at night. I wore it on the full moon. It amused me to do so, and I did it without once invoking the name of Christ for protection.*

*I was a fool, and my family has paid the price for my pride and lack of faith. The mask is gone, but I can still feel it within me somehow, as though it has become a part of me. I do not know what the future will bring, but I fear it will be more bloodshed, and it will be me in some beastly form, rending apart my fellow man in bestial glee.*

*I only hope that someone stops me before I go too far.*

*God help me and spare the innocent.*

I put the diary down and sat back stunned, then it dawned on me: Where was the wolf mask?

I tore my apartment searching for it, I really did, but I could not find it. Still, I can feel its presence, like it’s lost, but also not. It’s like it’s here with me even though I cannot see it.

Today is only five days until Halloween. The sun has set, and I feel . . . strong, stronger than I have any right to feel. My dead girlfriend remains rotting in my bedroom, and it smells horrible. The neighbors are sure to complain soon.

I don’t understand what’s going on, but I do know this: I never should have bought that mask, and once I bought it, I never should have broken the rules. How was I supposed to know it was a real cursed object? There’s no science that can explain curses, real, magical curses. Magic isn’t real, right?

Who am I kidding. I believe in magic . . . now. But I came to believe too late. Too late to save my beloved Tiffany, and too late to save myself.

I need to flee. I need to get away from here, as soon as possible. I can feel the beast inside of me, and it wants to get out. I need to get as far away from people as possible, to disappear and never be seen again.

But I’m hungry, and there’s a great nightclub not far from here, and the night is young.

Perhaps I’ll stop in for a bite to eat before I begin my journey.",1,1729994384.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False
1gd0lir,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllureStories/comments/1gd0lir/the_mask_of_the_loup_garou/,The Mask of the Loup Garou,"I never should have entered that antique store, and I definitely shouldn’t have bought that mask. Gannon’s is known for buying and selling rare and unique antiques, and I wanted to impress my friends with a unique Halloween costume this year, so I thought the perfect solution would be to get my hands on a genuine antique costume, one of those strange, ultra creepy ones from the 1800’s or earlier. Sure, it would cost me, but can you really put a price on standing out?

The bell over the door jingled dully as I opened the door and walked in. The proprietor, and gray, bent over man with a thick, bushy beard and thick, round rimmed spectacles who was ninety if he was a day casually acknowledged me and went back to the ancient book he was examining.

The store wasn’t big, but it had space, only every last bit of that space was filled with relics of bygone eras. Not the usual furniture, silverware, and paintings of your typical antique shop. No. Everything here had a story, and as such, everything here commanded a premium price.

There was an old cavalry saber that was known to have killed no less than seven men in the Civil War. It even still had flecks of blood from its victims spattered along the blade and hilt. There was an old rope noose that had supposedly been used to hang a witch during the Salem Witch Trials. There was an ancient tome with strange symbols on the cover that once belonged to a European court wizard. There was even a hat that once belonged to a certain H. H. Holmes. The stories attached to each item were historical, mystical, and often macabre. And I loved it.

I didn’t believe in magic or mysticism, angels and demons, or anything else beyond what science could explain. That didn’t mean that I wasn’t fascinated by stories involving them though. How much more interesting would the world be if the supernatural actually did exist? It was a tantalizing proposition, and it’s why I had to buy it as soon as I saw it.

It was a wolf mask. Not a mask made to look like a wolf, but a mask made out of the skin and fur of a wolf’s head and neck. It was a masterful work of preservation and artistry that looked as alive on display that day as the creature itself must have looked in life.

I picked it up carefully, turning it over and around in my hand so I could see it from every angle. The work was beyond fine. I couldn’t even see the seams and threads that held it together. Not a single hair seemed to be missing from the thick, gray fur. The teeth were real, and firmly fixed into the snout. I assumed they were so well-done because the original jaws had been used to form the snarling mouth. The eyes were glass, and far too lifelike for such an aged item. Perfect replicas of thin glass set in the eye sockets.

I had to have it.

I checked the story card next to the original display. The price was outrageous, but I didn’t care. Not only was the mask perfect, but the supposed history couldn’t have been more ideal for the season.

It read simply: *Enchanted mask made from the preserved skin of a Loup Garou slain in Burgundy, France in 1137 AD. Do not wear at night.*

“Oh hohohoho,” I grunted excitedly. “I have plans for you!”

I brought the mask and story card to the checkout. Old man Gannon checked the item, and me with more scrutiny than I was really comfortable with before speaking. “Heed the warning boy,” he said sternly. “It wouldn’t do for you to tempt fate.”

I chuckled, ignoring the fact that he called me “boy”. He was probably the oldest man in town, so everyone was “boy” or “girl” to him. “You don’t have to worry about me,” I assured him. “You got any more documentation that goes with this? If I’m going to fork over two-thousand dollars for a mask, I want as much provenance as I can get.”

Old man Gannon grunted derisively. “Of course I have documents that go with it. A fair few actually. Be sure that you read them and take proper precautions.”

“Of course,” I replied seriously, lying through my teeth. The supernatural is not real after all. It’s a myth, legend, just stories. What this mask was, to me, was the foundation of the absolute best Halloween costume I had ever concocted. Sure, a werewolf costume wouldn’t be especially unique, but with that mask, it would be the most frighteningly real one our town had ever seen.

The old man went into the back room and quickly returned with a binder filled with documents in protectors, and a small leatherbound journal. “These are the provenance,” he declared. “The journal is of particular interest as it belonged to a previous owner of the mask, a Mr. Archibald Wembly of London, wrote it in the years Fifteen-Twelve through Fifteen-Fourteen. He went mad after wearing the mask and killed two people before he was cut down in the street. Witnesses swore that he looked more animal than man before he died. The police report is document one-hundred-twenty-three.”

I set the mask on the counter and quickly leafed through the documents. There were originals, and English translations for each. “All this and you’re only charging two-thousand dollars?” I asked incredulously. “Such a unique relic with this much provenance together . . . it has to be worth more.”

Old man Gannon nodded his head. “Yes. Yes it is,” he confirmed. “I actually paid more for it myself, but . . .” he trailed off. “Something about that particular item unsettles me. I wish to be rid of it sooner rather than later, so I’m taking a loss for my own peace of mind.”

I didn’t question it. If this old man was willing to let his superstitions be my gain, I was perfectly fine with it. I paid for the mask and happily took it home.

Looking back, I should never have been so sure of myself. Nor so proud. Nor so certain about how the world works. The events that followed changed my perspective of the nature of reality itself, and I don’t think I’ll ever be able to go back to how I was.

In my defense, and also to remove any possibility that I can claim ignorance if I get desperate enough, I need to confess that I did read the provenance documents right away. I didn’t read them to get any warnings to heed, or as some kind of user manual. I read them to learn the history of my beautiful, terrifyingly creepy wolf mask. Having the story at the tip of my tongue top tell at will would truly be the icing on what I knew would be a most impressive, and frightening cake, or, rather, costume.

The earliest documents were all about the supposed Loup Garou that was terrorizing the Burgundian countryside, and the hunt to put an end to the gruesome string of murders it was blamed for. Document twenty was a notice celebrating that the foul beast had finally been killed and skinned by a visiting huntsman who only asked to be allowed to keep the skin and take it back to him home as his reward. The local ruler, only too happy to get off so cheaply, permitted it.

The huntsman wrote that he brought the hide to a supposed witch named Lucia, who lived alone on a mountain named Muzsla in modern day Slovakia. He paid her handsomely with instructions to use the hide to create an item of power. One that would make him strong.

Apparently, she obliged, making the wolf mask, and he was happy, but it came with a strict set of rules. 1. Never wear the mask at night. 2. Never wear the mask on the day or night of the full moon. 3. Never wear the mask during the autumnal equinox. 4. Always invoke the name of Christ before donning the mask.

The man must have been wildly superstitious, because he followed the rules religiously. The following documents are filled with fanciful tales of the huntsman performing mighty deeds that led to him earning a minor lordship before retiring to administer his land holdings and eventually dying of old age.

What followed after was one document after another that spoke of the mask passing to a new owner who either did not read, or chose not to follow the rules, and how each one ultimately went mad, committing a varying number of murders, and being either killed during the apprehension, or executed for their crimes. It gained a reputation as a cursed item that turned men into mindless beasts and drove them to kill and even cannibalize their victims.

“Holy crap!” I exclaimed as I finished reading the last page in the binder. “This is even better than I thought! I wonder what that Wembly guy wrote in his diary!”

It was getting late, so I decided to put off reading the diary for another day. I picked up my mask and looked it over, admiring it for both its craftsmanship and its history. “You just might be the coolest thing I’ll ever own,” I said to it as I caressed its cheek.

I looked into the glass eyes, and maybe it was a trick of the light, or maybe it was the lateness of the hour playing tricks with my mind, but I could have sworn those eyes, those glass eyes, looked back at me.

\*\*\*\*

I awoke the next morning to my girlfriend letting herself into my apartment. Her key clicked in the lock, and the door squeaked noisily as she opened it.

“Wake up sleepyhead!” she called.

I sat up and groaned in response as I rubbed the sleep out of my eyes. I checked the clock on my nightstand, saw the time, and got annoyed. “It’s seven a.m. on a Saturday!”

“We have plan’s remember?” she called out. “We’re supposed to . . . what is this?” she asked. Her tone changed from businesslike to pure excitement.

I stepped out of my bedroom clad in nothing but my night pants. She was excitedly holding up the wolf mask and admiring it. “It’s a cursed wolf mask,” I replied with a yawn. “It’s the centerpiece of my Halloween costume this year.”

“It’s looks so real,” she said admiringly, then her expression darkened and she put the mask down on the table. “Did you say ‘cursed’?” she sharply inquired.

“Yeah,” I yawned again. “It’s almost a thousand years old. The documents it came with say that a bunch of its previous owners went psycho and started killing people.”

“And you bought it?” she practically shrieked. “And you’re going to wear it?”

I filled the coffee maker and turned it on. “Don’t tell me you believe in magic, voodoo, curses, and all that nonsense,” I replied tiredly.

She took pause at that. I knew her answer, it was a major point of agreement between us. What science can’t explain either isn’t real, or just hasn’t been properly explained yet. Nothing is supernatural.

She finally replied. It’s just . . .” she paused. “If a bunch of people who owned it really did turn into psycho killers, there’s gotta be something there.”

I poured a cup of black coffee from the still brewing pot and took a sip. It was too hot but I didn’t care. “Sure there is,” I replied. “Social contagion. People believe it’s cursed, so they respond as though it’s cursed. It’s nothing special.”

It must have made sense to her, because he whole attitude changed again. “Have you tried it on yet?” she asked with a slight smile, her fear replaced with the admiration and curiosity she had when she first laid eyes on the mask.

It struck me that I hadn’t, so I picked it up, looked my girlfriend in the eyes, said “Jesus Christ” in a mocking tone, and put it on. It felt . . . perfect, as though it were made just for me. It slipped over my head easily and seemed to snug down to a perfect form fit. It had no odor, and I could see clearly with a full field of view through the glass eyes. “Not until just now,” I replied teasingly.

“EEEEK!” she shrieked.

“What?” I asked, alarmed, turning my head rapidly to see what had so alarmed her.

“The mouth moved when you talked!” she squealed. “It moved, and it moved in a perfect match for your words!”

I cocked my head to the side and looked at her quizzically. “For real?” I asked. It’s moving with my mouth?”

“Yes!’ she said excitedly. “Go see in the mirror!”

I did. I spoke. “Abracadabra, hocus pokus, jiggedy jokeus!” I said to my reflection.

Sure enough, the mouth moved in a lupine imitation of my own mouth movements. The movement were so well synced that I could swear I even saw the lips move although I knew it to be impossible. I took the mask off and admired it with the fattest grin of all time on my face.

“That’s amazing!” I exclaimed. “That old witch was a real master! I didn’t know people even knew how to make a mask’s mouth move in the twelfth century!?

“I know right?” My girlfriend, Tiffany said with as much excitement as I felt. “You’re going to have an amazing Halloween costume this year!”

I removed the mask, smiled at her, an nodded my head in affirmation.

“Just one thing,” she said with a hint of confusion. “What’s with that thing you said before you put the mask on?”

It took me a moment to remember what she was talking about. “Oh!” I snapped my fingers as I remembered. “There was a silly little list of rules, I was mocking them.” I grabbed the folder of provenance and flipped to the page with the rules on it. “See?” I said, pointing at the small passage. “Four ridiculous rules.”

Tiffany read them quickly and looked at me with a touch of confusion. “People actually believed this crap?” she said incredulously.

“I know, right?” I laughed.

She laughed with me for a bit, then stopped suddenly and glared at me. “Wait a minute,” she said sternly. “How much did you pay for this mask anyway?”

\*\*\*\*\*

The next few days were perfectly ordinary until the seventeenth. That was the day I finished assembling my costume, and one of two full moons in a row this year. I remember bringing home a pair of retro ripped jeans to go with the red plaid flannel shirt, theater prop quality werewolf gloves, complete with a set of long claws tipping the fingers, and other clothing reminiscent of an 80’s era movie werewolf.

The sun had set hours earlier. I obtained the pants shopping with Tiffany after our dinner date, and I was absolutely thrilled. I couldn’t wait to try it all on and see how it went together.

It was glorious. I donned the outfit, then slowly, almost ritualistically lowered the mask over my head to complete the costume.

It was like magic in the mirror. I looked myself over, and I loved what I saw. I looked like something out of Teen Wolf, only better. Sure, I could have achieved something very much like it far more cheaply. I could have just gone to Spirit Halloween, bought a costume or a rubber mask, and went to Walmart for finishing touches and adjustments, and done a satisfactory job for under $200, but that’s not what I wanted. I wanted the rizz. I wanted to stand out among all the other costumed partygoers at the fraternity Halloween party. This costume absolutely did it, and I couldn’t have been happier.

In my ecstasy, I noticed a . . . feeling running through my body, as though there was a kind of . . . energy coursing through me. It wasn’t as simple as “a burning in my blood” or “my nerves were on fire”. No, it was a feeling of power, as though I was still myself, but also something . . . more.

I felt as though I could toss four men over my shoulders and run a marathon. I felt as though I could get in a bar fight and kick every ass in the place. I felt . . . godly.

I removed the mask after a few minutes and inspected my outfit without it. I felt normal again, and, somehow, it felt wrong. I felt like my ordinary self was somehow no longer enough. I felt incomplete, like I removed a piece of myself when I removed the mask.

“Stop being ridiculous,” I told my reflection. “You’re letting myth and superstition influence you. You’re better than that!”

And yet, I felt like I was lying to myself. Right there, staring at my reflection, I felt like the man looking back at me wasn’t really me, like something unknowable was missing. I looked at my reflection and it felt as though I was looking at someone else, someone I didn’t really know, and who could never truly know me in return.

I shook my head to clear the strange thoughts and center myself again. “Pictures!” I reminded myself. “Tiffany wanted pictures so she could put together something complementary.”

I took out my phone and held it up to the mirror to take a picture, and paused. I couldn’t send her a picture like this. My costume was incomplete. I needed to wear the mask or else my costume wasn’t really my costume, and how could she possibly match her costume to mine if I sent her an incomplete photo?

I picked up the mask to put it on and paused. I paused to look at it, to admire it. I looked into its lifelike glass eyes. I stroked its fur as though it were a living thing. “You’re mine,” I told it in a low, almost silent voice. “You’re mine, and I am your master!”

I continued to stare into those perfectly crafted glass eyes, losing myself in them, and wanting nothing in the world so much as I wanted to put that mask on and forget myself. Slowly, almost robotically, I raised it up and gently lowered it over my head.

I felt a rush of euphoria, like what I felt earlier only a hundred times more potent. I took my phone in hand, opened the camera app, raised it, and snapped a single picture of myself in the mirror.

I opened text messaging, selected Tiffany, attached the message, and typed the following text: “It’s complete, and now I’m complete.”

I hit send. I looked into the mirror and met my own gaze staring back at me through those glass eyes that had no business looking as real and alive as they did, and then the world went blank.

I awoke the next day with no idea where I was. I opened my eyes only to be greeted by the rising sun in the middle of a forest.

A forest?

There was a forest outside of town, but it wasn’t exactly a short walk if you catch my drift.

It was easily a half an hour’s drive once you got out of town, and not exactly the kind of thing you just get up and walk to like you’re taking the dog out to the local community park.

I woke up there, and not on the edge either, but well inside the borders, and I was covered in a red, sticky substance that could only be blood, and my stomach hurt like I had gotten drunk and did my best to eat my own body weight at the local Asian buffet.

“What the . . .” I trailed off as I looked at my hands and arms and was taken aback by the dried red and brown goop covering them. I looked down at myself and saw that I was still in my costume, and my clothing was utterly ruined, covered in a deep red liquid that was surely blood.

I realized that I was still wearing the mask, and I ripped it off of my head in a panic. My breath came in great heaves, uncontrollable, and my head began to swim as I hyperventilated.

I closed my eyes and forced myself to calm down. I made myself breathe slower, and slower, and slower still until I finally brought it down to normal. I focused on my heart rate, and gradually brought it down with a blend of deep breathing and mind clearing.

Once I had myself physically under control, I looked at myself again.

How did I get covered in such a disgustingly massive amount of blood? Why did my stomach hurt so much? How did the wolf mask manage to stay clean when the rest of me was drenched in filth? And why did I-

My stomach finally gave up and rebelled. I dropped the wolf mask and fell to my knees retching and vomiting a copious amount of stomach contents. I vomited even as I found myself losing my breath and desperately wanting to breathe. I vomited even as my lack of breath began to make my head swim. I vomited even as my vision blurred and blackened at the edges.

Then I was able to breathe again. I took in great, gasping gulps of air. I I heaved and panted as I sought to restore my oxygen supply.

Then I vomited again.

If possible, I can say that the second round was worse than the third. It didn’t hit me so continuously as to cut me off from breathing completely like the first round did, but it did let me get just enough breath to barely subsist before striking again until I thought I would surely pass out, and then it subsided just long enough to tease me again before taking over and nearly choking me to death over and over and over again until I wished that I could just die and get it over with,

When I was finally finished, my stomach felt better, but there was glistening pile of partially digested stomach contents all over the ground in front of me. I wish I could say that I knew what I was looking at, but it was all so thoroughly masticated that I couldn’t hope pick one bit from another. All I knew was that none of it looked cooked, and I didn’t see anything that could pass for a vegetable anywhere in the nasty mix.

My stomach felt better though.

I picked up my mask, chose a random direction, and began to walk. I must have chosen well, because after only two hours, I came across a road.

I’m not ignorant. I’ve driven in and out of town plenty of times. I know my way around in town and around the outskirts of my hometown. That’s why I knew that I needed to go left once I reached this road if I wanted to get home. How long would it take? Fucked if I know. All that mattered was I was going the right direction, and the rest would fall into place one way or another.

And fall into place it did. Less than an hour of walking later, A random pickup truck pulled over. The driver listened to my story, and told me to hop in the bed of his truck and he’d take me into town. I did it gratefully, and he was as good as his word, better even. He dropped me off outside my apartment building, told me to stay off the drugs, and went on his merry way.

I went inside, took the elevator to my floor, opened my door without needing to use my key, which was also weird since I never, ever, EVER left my apartment without locking it, and immediately rushed to the shower so I could get clean and feel human again.

I was brushing my teeth for the third time when I heard my phone ringing. It was on the floor, pushed up against the wall under the sink. Why? I don’t know. But I found it, pulled it out, and answered the call.

“Where have you been?” Tiffany practically shrieked in my ear. I’ve been calling and texting all night and I haven’t heard a word from you! If you didn’t pick up the phone this time I was going to call the cops to make sure you weren’t dead!”

On the one hand, it felt surreal being yelled at so mundanely after the freaky mystery I woke up to. On the other, what in the ever-living hell was going on?

I let my girlfriend yell for awhile until she was all shouted out. Then I responded. “I don’t know where I was last night,” I told her in a shaky voice. “One minute I was home, the next I was waking up in the middle of nowhere covered in blood.”

This set off another wave of panicked screeching that eventually settled down into sobbing and expressions of gratitude that I was alright. She told me she was coming right over and hung up before I could protest.

I had a very, very bad feeling about her coming over.

\*\*\*\*\*

It literally took all day to get Tiffany settled down and comfortable with the fact that that, in spite of everything, I was alright. I didn’t tell her about how my body had violently purged my stomach of an inhuman amount of raw flesh shortly after waking up. I was already washed up, and my bloody costume was in the wash getting as clean as I could hope for it to be.

It was actually the laundry that got her settled down. She volunteered to take my costume out of the dryer, and was absolutely delighted to see that I had added to it by dying in a bunch of red and brown staining. “It’s actually looks like you ripped something apart and ate it!” she said excitedly. “You’re so good at making Halloween costumes!”

“Yeah . . .” I said slowly before trailing off. “I modified it . . .”

She didn’t give me a chance to finish my words or my thoughts before she jumped me. Perhaps if she hadn’t been so excited and relieved that I was safe and healthy, things would have turned out differently. Perhaps if our intimate life wasn’t so . . . frequent and vigorous, everything would have turned out differently.

As it was, I succumbed to her passion, and we fell asleep in each other’s arms for an afternoon nap.

\*\*\*\*\*

I awoke before Tiffany did, and I went to the living room to examine the mask. I felt scared holding it. It felt wrong to put my hands upon that artifact, as though I was touching a power I could not hope to control or comprehend.

I turned it over, and over, and over again, examining it to the finest detail.

Why did this mask, out of everything I wore last night, not have a single drop of blood on it? Why was the last thing I could remember putting it on and taking a selfie?

That thought triggered something in me, and I took out my phone. I didn’t have it with me in the forest, and I couldn’t remember checking the picture I took or sending it to Tiffany.

I opened the photos and looked at the last picture I took.

I don’t know what I was expecting. Maybe a photo of myself mid-metamorphosis. Mayne I thought I’d catch myself becoming something other than, well, me. What I actually saw was me, in my costume, with my phone in my hand.

I looked at the picture again, not really believing that it could be so mundane, and I thought I could see something . . . different in those lifelike glass eyes, I though that maybe, just maybe there was a hint of something in there that was not only me. But no. It couldn’t be. The supernatural isn’t real after all. It’s all hokum. Bunk. Small-minded garbage that enlightened people like me didn’t believe in.

The sun had set. It wasn’t down for long, but it was the second day of the rarest kind of blue moon event, the kind where the full moon happens two days in a row. I looked into the eyes of the mask, this perfect, masterfully crafted mask, lifted it up, and lowered it onto my head.

\*\*\*\*\*

I woke up the next morning, the nineteenth of October, a mere week ago to the most horrifying sight of my life.

I awoke on the floor of my own apartment, but once again, I was covered in blood and filth.

“How?” I screamed in horror, not understanding where the ungodly mess had come from.

My stomach was killing me. I rushed to my bathroom and barely made it to the toilet before my stomach decided to evacuate its contents, then and keep evacuating itself even when there was nothing but water and bile left to push out. It went on, and on, and on, until I wished I would just die rather than endure another moment of such violent illness.

I flushed the toilet whenever I had the presence of mind to do so without checking to see what had come out of me. I had seen what came out the day before, and I didn’t want to see it again. Perhaps that’s why I failed to recognize any of the bits and parts, the solid matter mixed in with the wretched fluids that erupted from my stomach and out of my mouth.

Regardless, I was glued to the toilet until my stomach finally settled down after who-knows how long. Then I stripped my bloody clothing and took a shower so hot I felt like it might burn the skin from my bones, and I was okay with that.

I felt dirty inside and out. It was wrong. Wrong in every way. Down to my soul if I had believed it at the time, I felt wrong, dirty, and thoroughly corrupted.

I was in the shower for an hour, lost in feelings rather than thought. Wondering what had happened and how I managed to wind up covered in blood again in my own apartment. It was only when I finally shut off the water and was halfway through drying off that it hit me.

Tiffany!”

I screamed, and I ran to my bedroom.

I burst into my bedroom, and was greeted by the most horrific mess I could possibly imagine. The entire room was splattered with blood and viscera. Not a surface was spared as at least some red drops or other . . . scraps was on every surface, every knick-knack, every everything in the room

My screams only got louder and more insistent as I scanned the room and found the head of Tifany, my beautiful Tiffany, beloved girlfriend of three years, on a pillow, fully detached from her body, lifeless eyes staring off into the void. I hurled myself to it, reaching desperately, not willing to believe in what I was seeing.

I picked it up and stared into her sightless eyes, and burst into tears. “Tiffany,” I sobbed. “How? Why?”

I looked around and took the horrific scene in. I recognized the various parts of my beloved scattered around the room. Legs and arms tossed about, bones scattered all over, looking like they had been gnawed upon by a great beast. And not one of her internal organs to be seen.

I remembered how upset my stomach was when I woke up, and how distended it appeared before I threw up the contents in a prolonged, and violent fit. How much of her had I simply flushed away, not knowing what I was doing because I refused to just open my eyes as I vomited up my sick?

I dropped Tiffany’s head back onto my bed and scrambled to the living room. I picked up the diary of Archibald Wembly and read it thoroughly. Much of it was a repeat of what I had already read before in the other provenance, until I got to the end. Here is what is read:

*I should have listened to the rules. I should have learned from the mistakes of others. I didn’t, and now I am paying the price for my foolishness. The mask is gone, but I can feel it’s influence on me even as I write these words.  I blacked out again last night, and when I awoke this morning, my family was dead, ripped apart from some foul beast. Every last one of them. My wife Abigail, and the children George, Franklin, Erin, and Caleb. All of them were torn apart. Only I was spared, and I was covered in such an amount of blood and gore that it could only have come from many animals, of a family of people. I ignored the rules. I wore the mask at night. I wore it on the full moon. It amused me to do so, and I did it without once invoking the name of Christ for protection.*

*I was a fool, and my family has paid the price for my pride and lack of faith. The mask is gone, but I can still feel it within me somehow, as though it has become a part of me. I do not know what the future will bring, but I fear it will be more bloodshed, and it will be me in some beastly form, rending apart my fellow man in bestial glee.*

*I only hope that someone stops me before I go too far.*

*God help me and spare the innocent.*

I put the diary down and sat back stunned, then it dawned on me: Where was the wolf mask?

I tore my apartment searching for it, I really did, but I could not find it. Still, I can feel its presence, like it’s lost, but also not. It’s like it’s here with me even though I cannot see it.

Today is only five days until Halloween. The sun has set, and I feel . . . strong, stronger than I have any right to feel. My dead girlfriend remains rotting in my bedroom, and it smells horrible. The neighbors are sure to complain soon.

I don’t understand what’s going on, but I do know this: I never should have bought that mask, and once I bought it, I never should have broken the rules. How was I supposed to know it was a real cursed object? There’s no science that can explain curses, real, magical curses. Magic isn’t real, right?

Who am I kidding. I believe in magic . . . now. But I came to believe too late. Too late to save my beloved Tiffany, and too late to save myself.

I need to flee. I need to get away from here, as soon as possible. I can feel the beast inside of me, and it wants to get out. I need to get as far away from people as possible, to disappear and never be seen again.

But I’m hungry, and there’s a great nightclub not far from here, and the night is young.

Gannon’s is known for buying and selling rare and unique antiques, and I wanted to impress my friends with a unique Halloween costume this year, so I thought the perfect solution would be to get my hands on a genuine antique costume, one of those strange, ultra creepy ones from the 1800’s or earlier. Sure, it would cost me, but can you really put a price on standing out?

The bell over the door jingled dully as I opened the door and walked in. The proprietor, and gray, bent over man with a thick, bushy beard and thick, round rimmed spectacles who was ninety if he was a day casually acknowledged me and went back to the ancient book he was examining.

The store wasn’t big, but it had space, only every last bit of that space was filled with relics of bygone eras. Not the usual furniture, silverware, and paintings of your typical antique shop. No. Everything here had a story, and as such, everything here commanded a premium price.

There was an old cavalry saber that was known to have killed no less than seven men in the Civil War. It even still had flecks of blood from its victims spattered along the blade and hilt. There was an old rope noose that had supposedly been used to hang a witch during the Salem Witch Trials. There was an ancient tome with strange symbols on the cover that once belonged to a European court wizard. There was even a hat that once belonged to a certain H. H. Holmes. The stories attached to each item were historical, mystical, and often macabre. And I loved it.

I didn’t believe in magic or mysticism, angels and demons, or anything else beyond what science could explain. That didn’t mean that I wasn’t fascinated by stories involving them though. How much more interesting would the world be if the supernatural actually did exist? It was a tantalizing proposition, and it’s why I had to buy it as soon as I saw it.

It was a wolf mask. Not a mask made to look like a wolf, but a mask made out of the skin and fur of a wolf’s head and neck. It was a masterful work of preservation and artistry that looked as alive on display that day as the creature itself must have looked in life.

I picked it up carefully, turning it over and around in my hand so I could see it from every angle. The work was beyond fine. I couldn’t even see the seams and threads that held it together. Not a single hair seemed to be missing from the thick, gray fur. The teeth were real, and firmly fixed into the snout. I assumed they were so well-done because the original jaws had been used to form the snarling mouth. The eyes were glass, and far too lifelike for such an aged item. Perfect replicas of thin glass set in the eye sockets.

I had to have it.

I checked the story card next to the original display. The price was outrageous, but I didn’t care. Not only was the mask perfect, but the supposed history couldn’t have been more ideal for the season.

It read simply: *Enchanted mask made from the preserved skin of a Loup Garou slain in Burgundy, France in 1137 AD. Do not wear at night.*

“Oh hohohoho,” I grunted excitedly. “I have plans for you!”

I brought the mask and story card to the checkout. Old man Gannon checked the item, and me with more scrutiny than I was really comfortable with before speaking. “Heed the warning boy,” he said sternly. “It wouldn’t do for you to tempt fate.”

I chuckled, ignoring the fact that he called me “boy”. He was probably the oldest man in town, so everyone was “boy” or “girl” to him. “You don’t have to worry about me,” I assured him. “You got any more documentation that goes with this? If I’m going to fork over two-thousand dollars for a mask, I want as much provenance as I can get.”

Old man Gannon grunted derisively. “Of course I have documents that go with it. A fair few actually. Be sure that you read them and take proper precautions.”

“Of course,” I replied seriously, lying through my teeth. The supernatural is not real after all. It’s a myth, legend, just stories. What this mask was, to me, was the foundation of the absolute best Halloween costume I had ever concocted. Sure, a werewolf costume wouldn’t be especially unique, but with that mask, it would be the most frighteningly real one our town had ever seen.

The old man went into the back room and quickly returned with a binder filled with documents in protectors, and a small leatherbound journal. “These are the provenance,” he declared. “The journal is of particular interest as it belonged to a previous owner of the mask, a Mr. Archibald Wembly of London, wrote it in the years Fifteen-Twelve through Fifteen-Fourteen. He went mad after wearing the mask and killed two people before he was cut down in the street. Witnesses swore that he looked more animal than man before he died. The police report is document one-hundred-twenty-three.”

I set the mask on the counter and quickly leafed through the documents. There were originals, and English translations for each. “All this and you’re only charging two-thousand dollars?” I asked incredulously. “Such a unique relic with this much provenance together . . . it has to be worth more.”

Old man Gannon nodded his head. “Yes. Yes it is,” he confirmed. “I actually paid more for it myself, but . . .” he trailed off. “Something about that particular item unsettles me. I wish to be rid of it sooner rather than later, so I’m taking a loss for my own peace of mind.”

I didn’t question it. If this old man was willing to let his superstitions be my gain, I was perfectly fine with it. I paid for the mask and happily took it home.

Looking back, I should never have been so sure of myself. Nor so proud. Nor so certain about how the world works. The events that followed changed my perspective of the nature of reality itself, and I don’t think I’ll ever be able to go back to how I was.

In my defense, and also to remove any possibility that I can claim ignorance if I get desperate enough, I need to confess that I did read the provenance documents right away. I didn’t read them to get any warnings to heed, or as some kind of user manual. I read them to learn the history of my beautiful, terrifyingly creepy wolf mask. Having the story at the tip of my tongue top tell at will would truly be the icing on what I knew would be a most impressive, and frightening cake, or, rather, costume.

The earliest documents were all about the supposed Loup Garou that was terrorizing the Burgundian countryside, and the hunt to put an end to the gruesome string of murders it was blamed for. Document twenty was a notice celebrating that the foul beast had finally been killed and skinned by a visiting huntsman who only asked to be allowed to keep the skin and take it back to him home as his reward. The local ruler, only too happy to get off so cheaply, permitted it.

The huntsman wrote that he brought the hide to a supposed witch named Lucia, who lived alone on a mountain named Muzsla in modern day Slovakia. He paid her handsomely with instructions to use the hide to create an item of power. One that would make him strong.

Apparently, she obliged, making the wolf mask, and he was happy, but it came with a strict set of rules. 1. Never wear the mask at night. 2. Never wear the mask on the day or night of the full moon. 3. Never wear the mask during the autumnal equinox. 4. Always invoke the name of Christ before donning the mask.

The man must have been wildly superstitious, because he followed the rules religiously. The following documents are filled with fanciful tales of the huntsman performing mighty deeds that led to him earning a minor lordship before retiring to administer his land holdings and eventually dying of old age.

What followed after was one document after another that spoke of the mask passing to a new owner who either did not read, or chose not to follow the rules, and how each one ultimately went mad, committing a varying number of murders, and being either killed during the apprehension, or executed for their crimes. It gained a reputation as a cursed item that turned men into mindless beasts and drove them to kill and even cannibalize their victims.

“Holy crap!” I exclaimed as I finished reading the last page in the binder. “This is even better than I thought! I wonder what that Wembly guy wrote in his diary!”

It was getting late, so I decided to put off reading the diary for another day. I picked up my mask and looked it over, admiring it for both its craftsmanship and its history. “You just might be the coolest thing I’ll ever own,” I said to it as I caressed its cheek.

I looked into the glass eyes, and maybe it was a trick of the light, or maybe it was the lateness of the hour playing tricks with my mind, but I could have sworn those eyes, those glass eyes, looked back at me.

\*\*\*\*

I awoke the next morning to my girlfriend letting herself into my apartment. Her key clicked in the lock, and the door squeaked noisily as she opened it.

“Wake up sleepyhead!” she called.

I sat up and groaned in response as I rubbed the sleep out of my eyes. I checked the clock on my nightstand, saw the time, and got annoyed. “It’s seven a.m. on a Saturday!”

“We have plan’s remember?” she called out. “We’re supposed to . . . what is this?” she asked. Her tone changed from businesslike to pure excitement.

I stepped out of my bedroom clad in nothing but my night pants. She was excitedly holding up the wolf mask and admiring it. “It’s a cursed wolf mask,” I replied with a yawn. “It’s the centerpiece of my Halloween costume this year.”

“It’s looks so real,” she said admiringly, then her expression darkened and she put the mask down on the table. “Did you say ‘cursed’?” she sharply inquired.

“Yeah,” I yawned again. “It’s almost a thousand years old. The documents it came with say that a bunch of its previous owners went psycho and started killing people.”

“And you bought it?” she practically shrieked. “And you’re going to wear it?”

I filled the coffee maker and turned it on. “Don’t tell me you believe in magic, voodoo, curses, and all that nonsense,” I replied tiredly.

She took pause at that. I knew her answer, it was a major point of agreement between us. What science can’t explain either isn’t real, or just hasn’t been properly explained yet. Nothing is supernatural.

She finally replied. It’s just . . .” she paused. “If a bunch of people who owned it really did turn into psycho killers, there’s gotta be something there.”

I poured a cup of black coffee from the still brewing pot and took a sip. It was too hot but I didn’t care. “Sure there is,” I replied. “Social contagion. People believe it’s cursed, so they respond as though it’s cursed. It’s nothing special.”

It must have made sense to her, because he whole attitude changed again. “Have you tried it on yet?” she asked with a slight smile, her fear replaced with the admiration and curiosity she had when she first laid eyes on the mask.

It struck me that I hadn’t, so I picked it up, looked my girlfriend in the eyes, said “Jesus Christ” in a mocking tone, and put it on. It felt . . . perfect, as though it were made just for me. It slipped over my head easily and seemed to snug down to a perfect form fit. It had no odor, and I could see clearly with a full field of view through the glass eyes. “Not until just now,” I replied teasingly.

“EEEEK!” she shrieked.

“What?” I asked, alarmed, turning my head rapidly to see what had so alarmed her.

“The mouth moved when you talked!” she squealed. “It moved, and it moved in a perfect match for your words!”

I cocked my head to the side and looked at her quizzically. “For real?” I asked. It’s moving with my mouth?”

“Yes!’ she said excitedly. “Go see in the mirror!”

I did. I spoke. “Abracadabra, hocus pokus, jiggedy jokeus!” I said to my reflection.

Sure enough, the mouth moved in a lupine imitation of my own mouth movements. The movement were so well synced that I could swear I even saw the lips move although I knew it to be impossible. I took the mask off and admired it with the fattest grin of all time on my face.

“That’s amazing!” I exclaimed. “That old witch was a real master! I didn’t know people even knew how to make a mask’s mouth move in the twelfth century!?

“I know right?” My girlfriend, Tiffany said with as much excitement as I felt. “You’re going to have an amazing Halloween costume this year!”

I removed the mask, smiled at her, an nodded my head in affirmation.

“Just one thing,” she said with a hint of confusion. “What’s with that thing you said before you put the mask on?”

It took me a moment to remember what she was talking about. “Oh!” I snapped my fingers as I remembered. “There was a silly little list of rules, I was mocking them.” I grabbed the folder of provenance and flipped to the page with the rules on it. “See?” I said, pointing at the small passage. “Four ridiculous rules.”

Tiffany read them quickly and looked at me with a touch of confusion. “People actually believed this crap?” she said incredulously.

“I know, right?” I laughed.

She laughed with me for a bit, then stopped suddenly and glared at me. “Wait a minute,” she said sternly. “How much did you pay for this mask anyway?”

\*\*\*\*\*

The next few days were perfectly ordinary until the seventeenth. That was the day I finished assembling my costume, and one of two full moons in a row this year. I remember bringing home a pair of retro ripped jeans to go with the red plaid flannel shirt, theater prop quality werewolf gloves, complete with a set of long claws tipping the fingers, and other clothing reminiscent of an 80’s era movie werewolf.

The sun had set hours earlier. I obtained the pants shopping with Tiffany after our dinner date, and I was absolutely thrilled. I couldn’t wait to try it all on and see how it went together.

It was glorious. I donned the outfit, then slowly, almost ritualistically lowered the mask over my head to complete the costume.

It was like magic in the mirror. I looked myself over, and I loved what I saw. I looked like something out of Teen Wolf, only better. Sure, I could have achieved something very much like it far more cheaply. I could have just gone to Spirit Halloween, bought a costume or a rubber mask, and went to Walmart for finishing touches and adjustments, and done a satisfactory job for under $200, but that’s not what I wanted. I wanted the rizz. I wanted to stand out among all the other costumed partygoers at the fraternity Halloween party. This costume absolutely did it, and I couldn’t have been happier.

In my ecstasy, I noticed a . . . feeling running through my body, as though there was a kind of . . . energy coursing through me. It wasn’t as simple as “a burning in my blood” or “my nerves were on fire”. No, it was a feeling of power, as though I was still myself, but also something . . . more.

I felt as though I could toss four men over my shoulders and run a marathon. I felt as though I could get in a bar fight and kick every ass in the place. I felt . . . godly.

I removed the mask after a few minutes and inspected my outfit without it. I felt normal again, and, somehow, it felt wrong. I felt like my ordinary self was somehow no longer enough. I felt incomplete, like I removed a piece of myself when I removed the mask.

“Stop being ridiculous,” I told my reflection. “You’re letting myth and superstition influence you. You’re better than that!”

And yet, I felt like I was lying to myself. Right there, staring at my reflection, I felt like the man looking back at me wasn’t really me, like something unknowable was missing. I looked at my reflection and it felt as though I was looking at someone else, someone I didn’t really know, and who could never truly know me in return.

I shook my head to clear the strange thoughts and center myself again. “Pictures!” I reminded myself. “Tiffany wanted pictures so she could put together something complementary.”

I took out my phone and held it up to the mirror to take a picture, and paused. I couldn’t send her a picture like this. My costume was incomplete. I needed to wear the mask or else my costume wasn’t really my costume, and how could she possibly match her costume to mine if I sent her an incomplete photo?

I picked up the mask to put it on and paused. I paused to look at it, to admire it. I looked into its lifelike glass eyes. I stroked its fur as though it were a living thing. “You’re mine,” I told it in a low, almost silent voice. “You’re mine, and I am your master!”

I continued to stare into those perfectly crafted glass eyes, losing myself in them, and wanting nothing in the world so much as I wanted to put that mask on and forget myself. Slowly, almost robotically, I raised it up and gently lowered it over my head.

I felt a rush of euphoria, like what I felt earlier only a hundred times more potent. I took my phone in hand, opened the camera app, raised it, and snapped a single picture of myself in the mirror.

I opened text messaging, selected Tiffany, attached the message, and typed the following text: “It’s complete, and now I’m complete.”

I hit send. I looked into the mirror and met my own gaze staring back at me through those glass eyes that had no business looking as real and alive as they did, and then the world went blank.

\*\*\*\*\*

I awoke the next day with no idea where I was. I opened my eyes only to be greeted by the rising sun in the middle of a forest.

A forest?

There was a forest outside of town, but it wasn’t exactly a short walk if you catch my drift.

It was easily a half an hour’s drive once you got out of town, and not exactly the kind of thing you just get up and walk to like you’re taking the dog out to the local community park.

I woke up there, and not on the edge either, but well inside the borders, and I was covered in a red, sticky substance that could only be blood, and my stomach hurt like I had gotten drunk and did my best to eat my own body weight at the local Asian buffet.

“What the . . .” I trailed off as I looked at my hands and arms and was taken aback by the dried red and brown goop covering them. I looked down at myself and saw that I was still in my costume, and my clothing was utterly ruined, covered in a deep red liquid that was surely blood.

I realized that I was still wearing the mask, and I ripped it off of my head in a panic. My breath came in great heaves, uncontrollable, and my head began to swim as I hyperventilated.

I closed my eyes and forced myself to calm down. I made myself breathe slower, and slower, and slower still until I finally brought it down to normal. I focused on my heart rate, and gradually brought it down with a blend of deep breathing and mind clearing.

Once I had myself physically under control, I looked at myself again.

How did I get covered in such a disgustingly massive amount of blood? Why did my stomach hurt so much? How did the wolf mask manage to stay clean when the rest of me was drenched in filth? And why did I-

My stomach finally gave up and rebelled. I dropped the wolf mask and fell to my knees retching and vomiting a copious amount of stomach contents. I vomited even as I found myself losing my breath and desperately wanting to breathe. I vomited even as my lack of breath began to make my head swim. I vomited even as my vision blurred and blackened at the edges.

Then I was able to breathe again. I took in great, gasping gulps of air. I I heaved and panted as I sought to restore my oxygen supply.

Then I vomited again.

If possible, I can say that the second round was worse than the third. It didn’t hit me so continuously as to cut me off from breathing completely like the first round did, but it did let me get just enough breath to barely subsist before striking again until I thought I would surely pass out, and then it subsided just long enough to tease me again before taking over and nearly choking me to death over and over and over again until I wished that I could just die and get it over with,

When I was finally finished, my stomach felt better, but there was glistening pile of partially digested stomach contents all over the ground in front of me. I wish I could say that I knew what I was looking at, but it was all so thoroughly masticated that I couldn’t hope pick one bit from another. All I knew was that none of it looked cooked, and I didn’t see anything that could pass for a vegetable anywhere in the nasty mix.

My stomach felt better though.

I picked up my mask, chose a random direction, and began to walk. I must have chosen well, because after only two hours, I came across a road.

I’m not ignorant. I’ve driven in and out of town plenty of times. I know my way around in town and around the outskirts of my hometown. That’s why I knew that I needed to go left once I reached this road if I wanted to get home. How long would it take? Fucked if I know. All that mattered was I was going the right direction, and the rest would fall into place one way or another.

And fall into place it did. Less than an hour of walking later, A random pickup truck pulled over. The driver listened to my story, and told me to hop in the bed of his truck and he’d take me into town. I did it gratefully, and he was as good as his word, better even. He dropped me off outside my apartment building, told me to stay off the drugs, and went on his merry way.

I went inside, took the elevator to my floor, opened my door without needing to use my key, which was also weird since I never, ever, EVER left my apartment without locking it, and immediately rushed to the shower so I could get clean and feel human again.

I was brushing my teeth for the third time when I heard my phone ringing. It was on the floor, pushed up against the wall under the sink. Why? I don’t know. But I found it, pulled it out, and answered the call.

“Where have you been?” Tiffany practically shrieked in my ear. I’ve been calling and texting all night and I haven’t heard a word from you! If you didn’t pick up the phone this time I was going to call the cops to make sure you weren’t dead!”

On the one hand, it felt surreal being yelled at so mundanely after the freaky mystery I woke up to. On the other, what in the ever-living hell was going on?

I let my girlfriend yell for awhile until she was all shouted out. Then I responded. “I don’t know where I was last night,” I told her in a shaky voice. “One minute I was home, the next I was waking up in the middle of nowhere covered in blood.”

This set off another wave of panicked screeching that eventually settled down into sobbing and expressions of gratitude that I was alright. She told me she was coming right over and hung up before I could protest.

I had a very, very bad feeling about her coming over.

\*\*\*\*\*

It literally took all day to get Tiffany settled down and comfortable with the fact that that, in spite of everything, I was alright. I didn’t tell her about how my body had violently purged my stomach of an inhuman amount of raw flesh shortly after waking up. I was already washed up, and my bloody costume was in the wash getting as clean as I could hope for it to be.

It was actually the laundry that got her settled down. She volunteered to take my costume out of the dryer, and was absolutely delighted to see that I had added to it by dying in a bunch of red and brown staining. “It’s actually looks like you ripped something apart and ate it!” she said excitedly. “You’re so good at making Halloween costumes!”

“Yeah . . .” I said slowly before trailing off. “I modified it . . .”

She didn’t give me a chance to finish my words or my thoughts before she jumped me. Perhaps if she hadn’t been so excited and relieved that I was safe and healthy, things would have turned out differently. Perhaps if our intimate life wasn’t so . . . frequent and vigorous, everything would have turned out differently.

As it was, I succumbed to her passion, and we fell asleep in each other’s arms for an afternoon nap.

\*\*\*\*\*

I awoke before Tiffany did, and I went to the living room to examine the mask. I felt scared holding it. It felt wrong to put my hands upon that artifact, as though I was touching a power I could not hope to control or comprehend.

I turned it over, and over, and over again, examining it to the finest detail.

Why did this mask, out of everything I wore last night, not have a single drop of blood on it? Why was the last thing I could remember putting it on and taking a selfie?

That thought triggered something in me, and I took out my phone. I didn’t have it with me in the forest, and I couldn’t remember checking the picture I took or sending it to Tiffany.

I opened the photos and looked at the last picture I took.

I don’t know what I was expecting. Maybe a photo of myself mid-metamorphosis. Mayne I thought I’d catch myself becoming something other than, well, me. What I actually saw was me, in my costume, with my phone in my hand.

I looked at the picture again, not really believing that it could be so mundane, and I thought I could see something . . . different in those lifelike glass eyes, I though that maybe, just maybe there was a hint of something in there that was not only me. But no. It couldn’t be. The supernatural isn’t real after all. It’s all hokum. Bunk. Small-minded garbage that enlightened people like me didn’t believe in.

The sun had set. It wasn’t down for long, but it was the second day of the rarest kind of blue moon event, the kind where the full moon happens two days in a row. I looked into the eyes of the mask, this perfect, masterfully crafted mask, lifted it up, and lowered it onto my head.

\*\*\*\*\*

I woke up the next morning, the nineteenth of October, a mere week ago to the most horrifying sight of my life.

I awoke on the floor of my own apartment, but once again, I was covered in blood and filth.

“How?” I screamed in horror, not understanding where the ungodly mess had come from.

My stomach was killing me. I rushed to my bathroom and barely made it to the toilet before my stomach decided to evacuate its contents, then and keep evacuating itself even when there was nothing but water and bile left to push out. It went on, and on, and on, until I wished I would just die rather than endure another moment of such violent illness.

I flushed the toilet whenever I had the presence of mind to do so without checking to see what had come out of me. I had seen what came out the day before, and I didn’t want to see it again. Perhaps that’s why I failed to recognize any of the bits and parts, the solid matter mixed in with the wretched fluids that erupted from my stomach and out of my mouth.

Regardless, I was glued to the toilet until my stomach finally settled down after who-knows how long. Then I stripped my bloody clothing and took a shower so hot I felt like it might burn the skin from my bones, and I was okay with that.

I felt dirty inside and out. It was wrong. Wrong in every way. Down to my soul if I had believed it at the time, I felt wrong, dirty, and thoroughly corrupted.

I was in the shower for an hour, lost in feelings rather than thought. Wondering what had happened and how I managed to wind up covered in blood again in my own apartment. It was only when I finally shut off the water and was halfway through drying off that it hit me.

Tiffany!”

I screamed, and I ran to my bedroom.

I burst into my bedroom, and was greeted by the most horrific mess I could possibly imagine. The entire room was splattered with blood and viscera. Not a surface was spared as at least some red drops or other . . . scraps was on every surface, every knick-knack, every everything in the room

My screams only got louder and more insistent as I scanned the room and found the head of Tifany, my beautiful Tiffany, beloved girlfriend of three years, on a pillow, fully detached from her body, lifeless eyes staring off into the void. I hurled myself to it, reaching desperately, not willing to believe in what I was seeing.

I picked it up and stared into her sightless eyes, and burst into tears. “Tiffany,” I sobbed. “How? Why?”

I looked around and took the horrific scene in. I recognized the various parts of my beloved scattered around the room. Legs and arms tossed about, bones scattered all over, looking like they had been gnawed upon by a great beast. And not one of her internal organs to be seen.

I remembered how upset my stomach was when I woke up, and how distended it appeared before I threw up the contents in a prolonged, and violent fit. How much of her had I simply flushed away, not knowing what I was doing because I refused to just open my eyes as I vomited up my sick?

I dropped Tiffany’s head back onto my bed and scrambled to the living room. I picked up the diary of Archibald Wembly and read it thoroughly. Much of it was a repeat of what I had already read before in the other provenance, until I got to the end. Here is what is read:

*I should have listened to the rules. I should have learned from the mistakes of others. I didn’t, and now I am paying the price for my foolishness. The mask is gone, but I can feel it’s influence on me even as I write these words.  I blacked out again last night, and when I awoke this morning, my family was dead, ripped apart from some foul beast. Every last one of them. My wife Abigail, and the children George, Franklin, Erin, and Caleb. All of them were torn apart. Only I was spared, and I was covered in such an amount of blood and gore that it could only have come from many animals, of a family of people. I ignored the rules. I wore the mask at night. I wore it on the full moon. It amused me to do so, and I did it without once invoking the name of Christ for protection.*

*I was a fool, and my family has paid the price for my pride and lack of faith. The mask is gone, but I can still feel it within me somehow, as though it has become a part of me. I do not know what the future will bring, but I fear it will be more bloodshed, and it will be me in some beastly form, rending apart my fellow man in bestial glee.*

*I only hope that someone stops me before I go too far.*

*God help me and spare the innocent.*

I put the diary down and sat back stunned, then it dawned on me: Where was the wolf mask?

I tore my apartment searching for it, I really did, but I could not find it. Still, I can feel its presence, like it’s lost, but also not. It’s like it’s here with me even though I cannot see it.

Today is only five days until Halloween. The sun has set, and I feel . . . strong, stronger than I have any right to feel. My dead girlfriend remains rotting in my bedroom, and it smells horrible. The neighbors are sure to complain soon.

I don’t understand what’s going on, but I do know this: I never should have bought that mask, and once I bought it, I never should have broken the rules. How was I supposed to know it was a real cursed object? There’s no science that can explain curses, real, magical curses. Magic isn’t real, right?

Who am I kidding. I believe in magic . . . now. But I came to believe too late. Too late to save my beloved Tiffany, and too late to save myself.

I need to flee. I need to get away from here, as soon as possible. I can feel the beast inside of me, and it wants to get out. I need to get as far away from people as possible, to disappear and never be seen again.

But I’m hungry, and there’s a great nightclub not far from here, and the night is young.

I 26F have been with my boyfriend 29M for over 4 years and we have a child under a year together. We also live together and have pets together. He also has another child with another woman. 
When we first started dating, up until I was about 5 months pregnant we had a great relationship. There were times of struggles, but what relationship doesn't have that. 

The issues I feel we are having lately are
-he doesn't clean after himself in ANY sense. I do his laundry and fold it, and if I don't put it away then it might never get put away. 

-he feels because I have had paid leave, I should be doing all the housework and taking care of our baby, and I see his point, but taking care of a Velcro baby is a job in itself, and I am struggling taking care of the baby, doing all the house work, taking care of our 3 animals, trying to get daily outings. I am now working 3 sometimes 4 days a week. 2 nine hour days and 1-2 eight hour days. I can't do it all, especially if dishes don't even make it in the sink, trash is left everywhere, he doesn't empty the trash. He feels he goes to work, and comes home to play video games, and barely acknowledge our child. I also feel because my leave is paid, I AM doing my job taking care of the baby. I also am almost exclusively breastfeeding him.

-he barely plays with our child, he visits his other child and buys the child toys almost every visit, but spend maybe 10 minutes a day talking to ours, if that. And that's not all at once. 

-he's been having a drinking problem, which in the past almost killed him. 

-when I try to talk to him about helping, he verbally attacks me and makes me feel like I don't do enough. In the past he said how I stay home sit around all day and play with the baby. 

On his defense, we have had a death recently in the family, and that took a huge toll on him. He also has had a lot of deaths in his side in the past couple years. He will do kind things for me at times, like buy me a coffee, but I don't know if coffee cuts it anymore. I get so sick of seeing all his trash and dishes left out for me to pick up. Like I'm a mom, not a maid. I don't know.

 Am I being overdramatic or should I break up with him? Should I try talking again first? My original plan was to wait until April to see if changes happens so we don't get evicted(we both live paycheck to paycheck), should I even wait? I do have my parents I could go to, but I don't know where he would go. What should I do? ",1,1729993644.0,relationshipadvice,4,1.0,False

Edit: since everyone is claiming morning sickness, just putting it out there that I have never actually experienced morning sickness and I’m super lucky with that. I have also not thrown up once during this pregnancy. This also all started at 1pm, which isn’t the morning for me. I threw up five times during my shift today. And no one came in to relieve me. I let my GM and the staff know in the groupchat we have the first couple of times I threw up. After that, I still had to work for 7 more hours. I gave up asking for help after the second time it happened. It is against health code for this company and my state to keep someone working after becoming sick. But my GM just didn’t seem to give a fuck. 
This is not the first time this has happened to me. (The other times it happened to me I was not pregnant) As well as other employees. Someone has fainted but still had to finish their shift. Multiple people have been forced to finish their shifts after throwing up or projectile vomiting under this GM. It is getting ridiculous. 
My coworker was scheduled to work 7 days in a row while sick. She let us all know she was sick, but the GM told her that she had to continue working. I would have covered for her if I wasn’t already scheduled to work most of those days with her! I am also much more susceptible to illness being pregnant, and had to work with someone who is sick. Which makes sense as to why I got so sick today. 
This behavior is disgusting. And we all discuss it regularly. But we are also all afraid of going to HR, because we don’t want to experience retaliation (cutting our hours for speaking up or getting fired). I’m getting really sick and tired of seeing the teenagers I work with being put through this shit. They’re fucking children and shouldn’t be forced to work through illness.

My name is Daniel and I'm from Southern California (the Inland Empire, specifically). I'm just looking for someone to have a genuinely great time with. I'm not a very picky person and I don't really care much for looks. I more so value your personality and how well we vibe, so pretty much anyone is welcome to get to know me! (I mean that in the most non-conceited way possible lol). I would just ask that you be 21 and older.

My interests:

~ As stated in my title I would consider myself the typical nerdy type (gaming, anime, comic books, super hero movies, etc.) If you like share any of those interests then I think we'll get along great lol

~ I'm Black and Cherokee, I'm bilingual (English and Japanese), around 5'11"" but 6 feet tall on a good day.

~ On top of being your typical nerd I am also a huge horror movie fan to the point of considering making my own horror movie. I have a couple ideas and I would love to share them with someone who's interested in hearing them.

~ I listen to any kind of music except country cuz it all sounds the same to me lol. So if that's a deal breaker then I apologize but I just can't get into it. I also used to rap and sing and have been thinking of doing it again. I have made about 9 or 10 songs in total. Let me know if you'd like to hear something I've made.

~ I love coffee and boba so random coffee and boba runs will be a thing. One of my favorite things to is visit a coffee place I've never been to and try out their coffee and see if I'm adding it to my list or favorite spots or if I'm just never going there again. I know, it sounds weird but I promise it can be kinda fun.

1gd05t6,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gd05t6/husband_confessed_hes_never_been_physically/,Husband confessed he’s never been physically attracted to me.,"Husband confessed he’s never been physically attracted to me.

I (32F) and my husband (40M) have been together for just over 4 years, married for 2 and have a baby under 1 year old. The other night, on our anniversary, I asked him why we are not intimate anymore. It wasn’t the first time I asked this. When I got pregnant he stopped being intimate completely (stating that he doesn’t want to “hurt the baby”/cause a miscarriage as we’ve been through that before). I didn’t protest during pregnancy because I was busy anyway (working full-time, finishing my medical degree, completing my clinical placements and doing an online course for him for a career change - all at the same time, while he was working 8h shifts in a hospitality job). I gave birth over 7 months ago and we only had sex 2 or 3 times. Every time I asked him about his lack of interest, he would say that he’s not happy about the way he looks (he put on around 10kg while I was pregnant) but other than a bit of belly fat he looks just the same and I still find him attractive. Anyway, on our anniversary I pressed the matter as we also had our son at daycare for 2-3 hours and I thought he might want to take advantage of that time. Eventually he told me that from the beginning he didn’t find me as physically attractive as he imagined by looking at my social media photos and he realised the first time we were intimate (3 months into the relationship) that I didn’t have the type of body he would “go crazy for and want to have sex with every day”, but he picked me and married me because I was marriage material and he wouldn’t have been embarrassed to present me to his family.

For context, the photos he’s referring to - I was 25yo in them, in a relationship with a guy who was providing for me, I didn’t have to work (I still did part-time to have some financial independence), I was sleeping 8-10hours/night, I was having time to exercise every day, money to get massages and spa and make-up and clothes etc. 
I believe I still look good, I lost all the pregnancy weight and I’m exercising every day while the baby is in the bouncer/playing on the mat/sleeping, I do power walks around the area where we live, I watch my food and calories, I still try to do my hair and makeup when I leave the house even for a coffee or groceries. Sure, I don’t walk around the house in the sexiest clothes because I’m looking after a baby and the house, but I’m still in gym leggings and tops. I look after myself as much as I possibly can given that I’ve also returned to work and I’ve supported this household for the past 5 months (remember the course I was doing for him to change careers? He quit his hospitality job and started one in this new field where he’s only paid on a commission base, but that hasn’t happened yet).

I am incredibly hurt by what he told me. I feel like my self esteem has gone down so much. He didn’t help with the baby at all until the last couple of months when I returned to work and he had to look after him for 8 hours 2-3 days a week. He’s helped around the house by cooking and doing laundry and cleaning since I gave birth. But he’s also not contributed financially during the last 4-5 months (I’m talking not even $1). He brought up his new job saying that he doesn’t feel supported by me, but how am I meant to support something that hasn’t even provided for baby nappies? Not $1, I’m not exaggerating.
I haven’t talked to him since this conversation 2 days ago and to be honest, I don’t feel like talking to him anytime soon. I didn’t know his real thoughts and feelings when I married him. I honestly thought he loved me as much as I love him and was attracted to me. He kept saying that it’s a good thing because he had “so many options” but he picked me because he could have never trusted those “options” to have a family with. 
I don’t know what I’m expecting from posting this.. I’m just releasing all my frustration and sadness here. 
And yes, I’ll continue to work on myself to be the best that I can be, maybe even better than those photos he keeps bringing up. But I have this sad feeling that I might not want him anymore once I get to that point.

What are you all thinking? Is my reaction an exaggeration?


**TL;DR; : My (32 F) husband (40 M) has confessed on our 2nd anniversary that’s he’s never been physically attracted to me because he imagined my body to be looking differently under the clothes (based on my social media photos). He still asked me to marry him and have kids with him because he is not embarrassed with me around his family (like he would have been with “so many other options” he had that he felt he could have had sex with them every day) and trusted me to have a family with. He’s also not contributed financially for the last 4-5 months since he quit his old job and started a new career that hasn’t brought any money in. I’m incredibly hurt and feel lied to and used. For context, I do look after myself, I’ve lost all the pregnancy weight, I wear makeup, I do my hair, I exercise daily, I watch my food. I just don’t have the money and time to have someone do this for me at a salon/spa and I do it at home. I also look after our baby every day 24/7 except for the days I go to work (8h 2-3 shifts/week).**.",31,1729992797.0,relationships,34,0.81,False

Her bus comes at 2pm , at 1.30pm I told her don't forget your bus and she said oh no that's fine I'll take the next one at 3pm, my mom looked at me and was like is ""she gonna come home with us?"" ,I  was also confused and just answered with ok . So her father lives around 10min away from where I live so she looked at me and said that she'll just call her dad so she could go and sleep at his house so I asked if she wanted to call him from my phone she was like no I'll call him later. Anyway at like 3pm we finished shopping and my mom gave me money so we could buy something to eat and she told me to go to a coffee shop and rest (since honestly it's the end of the week so the house is a little messy and we didn't feel comfortable to invite her plus we didn't cook ) but after we bought our food I asked her if she wanted to eat there she said no (to be fair it was literally on the street so I understand that ) so I just ended up taking her home with me . She met my cats and we started eating while watching something , like 10 -20 min later her mom calls and she asked her if she was home she answered that she'll stay at her dads and she's at a friend's house her mom was like ""ok call your dad because it's gonna rain and he's on a motorcycle not a car so you guys will get sick if it starts raining"" , at this point we have like two more bites from the sandwiches so she could have just called her dad to come and get her , but no she told her mom that she's still eating and that she'll call him when she's ready and she said that even if her father didn't answer she could just sleepover at my house . I was shocked even her mom was like"" no I'll  your dad for you"" . After finishing our lunch I took our plates and looked at her and was like ok call your dad now , at that moment her mom called again and said that she called him for her and that he'll be there in 10min . After that she started getting ready, we watched a little bit of the show and then she got out , I walked with her for a bit and then went home , but I just felt so uncomfortable the whole day and as if someone was sitting on my chest and blocking my airways it was suffocating .

I smoke cannabis (legal) but not cigarettes, and I don't drink alcohol or caffeine.

I will say, it did start after I first used my sonic toothbrush for the first time, but I am trying not to automatically equate the two, because a vibrating toothbrush knocking a filling loose sounds crazy, right? Could it still be residual sensitivity from getting the filling, despite the fact that it hasn't been cold sensitive since the day or so after the filling (which the dentist told me to expect)?

You talked to me about marriage in prison and now you don’t want to commit to me.  I don’t have a ring, and you haven’t proposed.  Why did you ask me to marry you”?  “Because I was being an idiot.”  Daniel and Bianca are starting to see each other as red flags and the convos are getting more brutally honest.  “It’s the little things.  Like a power trip,” accuses Bianca while the riposte is, “You need to walk on your own.  Don’t raise your face to me.  We don’t have to be together,”  Daniel’s voice is sharp and clear, but he’s not yelling though Bianca keeps telling him to stop yelling for yelling at her is the road to throwing things and accelerating into physical abuse.  That’s all she knows.  He doesn’t respect her boundaries she says, but forgets she doesn’t respect his.  He’s not a slave or a housekeeper and he’s not making coffee or washing dishes, and he warns her, “Don’t rely on me doing things to make you happy ‘cause that’s not going to work.”  They need to meet in the middle where Daniel is not expected to provide her with attention, entertainment, and companionship whenever she wants it.  Bianca needs to adjust her expectations, indulge in self-care before taking care of others, be mindful of her actions, learn to accept her own feelings, not rely on events to make her happy, be kind to herself, and learn how to say no, but that’s a big ask.  She vents to Andres instead while Daniel gets an earful from Cousin Robert and is dismayed to learn his girl has talked about their love life.  She’ll need a lot of all kinds of foreplay to make her sacrifices worthwhile.  *Expectations are resentments waiting to happen.*

All Justine and Michael thought about was creating life, but now their rash and ill-considered decision of a fifth birth has led them to an attorney to make end-of-life decisions.  When Michael hears about Justine’s decision to make Kylie her children’s guardian because she loves them as much as Justine and knows them well being around them for years, Michael feels so disrespected he walks out to calm down.  He doesn’t hear the attorney suggest co-parenting between Kylie and Michael.  Justine is aware of the burden she’s placing on a young college student, but that doesn’t stop her from encumbering Kylie who may not have agreed with this compromise.  *It's not the load that breaks you down, it’s the way you carry it.*

The government hotel room was too much for Britney, so they moved in temporarily with the androgenous-looking Coffee and his dog, Roger.  As they figure out their finances, Britney flashes nails masquerading as harpoons that are an extra unneeded expense helping drain Kerok’s slowly dwindling savings.  After not learning their lesson after their imprudent decision to move to Texas without prior approval, Kerok formulates an elopement plan to shortcut Britney’s official affirmation to parole to Texas.  If they marry, she’ll be family, and they can’t deny family.  Two felons can live together without any legal consequences if both have completed their sentences, but travel can be discretionary.  As Britney tells her friend Shaylah about the elopement, Shaylah worries that Kerok is controlling Britney when she learns Kerok has refused to go to Houston unless they are married.  This won’t be the big wedding of Britney’s dreams, but she can still shop for bridal gowns and finally calls her P.O. at her friend’s insistence.  She learns that Texas doesn’t like the folks who fraud them as family members, and as Britney was rejected for travel once, it’s likely to happen again.  *God must love stupid people; he made SO many.*

After college at the university of Iowa I rented an apartment with my fiancé in our hometown in Northern Illinois.

At one point we grabbed some coffee and committed to each other that we would move to Colorado.  We both wanted to live in a place near the mountains so we could spend our time outside and in the wilderness.

We eventually bought a home in Northern Illinois. She cheated on me.  The wedding was canceled and I spent 3 years in mental toil in the home we bought together.  During that time I met a girl in the city who fled her hometown in southern illinois but I kept my distance. I wasn't ready. I wasn't happy in Illinois.

I eventually sold the home, and moved to Colorado.  The girl followed me.  We spent time hiking in the mountains. I skied every year.  I rode my bike in the mountains religiously. We bought a home. We had a kid.  She started missing her family.  The 16 hour drive was too far.

We got pregnant with twins.  She felt isolated.  I told her we could move closer to her family.  We looked at every city within a reasonable drive of her hometown.  It was important for her to be close to her family.  It's important to me to be close to nature and mountains or ocean.

We are closing on a home in Maryville next week.  I'm not here to change your culture, I'm here to embrace it.  To become it.  To enjoy it for the same reasons you do.  It's a beautiful city.  I'm sorry your homes have become expensive. I'm sorry for the traffic. I'm sorry there are many people like me flocking to your city.

I just hope that everyone is as beautiful as they seem when we've met the locals in person. I'm excited. I'm a good person. I bring money to spend on local business and local taxes.  I hope we are welcomed.",0,1729992110.0,Knoxville,45,0.5,False

He has a 3yo son 50/50. We were neighbors before and both going through tragedies in life so we go close fast. Moved in together under a year dating because it was going so smoothly — mostly! 

He kept bringing up moving in together while I hesitated. I used to work in childcare and have no false understanding of how demanding toddlers are. Just going through a medical emergency that took months of physical recovery and emotional rebuilding, I expressed I was hesitant about having so many new tasks in a household — especially since I thought our relationship needed work still. We are very compatible and love each other but there’s no romance and never was. 

We rarely go on dates, he’s never gotten me flowers or a little gift or anything. Not even a coffee just to do something nice. I sent flowers for his mom when she was dying, do a lot of little fun things for his son, help him with certain household things before I even lived here, get him little treats or care packages when sick or just because. Not at the time, but occasionally. Would cook dinner almost every night that I came over.

That bothered me a little and I brought it up to him before we moved in. Nothing changed. Now that I’ve moved in I feel like I see the truth. He’s got a very demanding job and parenting a toddler is a lot. Not great stress management. He’s been falling asleep on the couch almost every night and we are having less sex already. 

Despite all of this, he expects me to be affectionate and happy. I’ve started to do more things that make me happy more often on my own — spend time with my family, exercise, hike with my dog. And he almost seems to be offended that I’m not attaching myself to his every whim / constantly available for whatever he wants to do. 

I feel partially responsible because my life was so small when we met that I didn’t require much and very much went with the flow. We have talked this out multiple times and both been very honest. I don’t think he’s a bad person, but I think he doesn’t have the capacity to be in a committed relationship. I’ve given him so many outs and he still is asking for a chance. 

I’m not happy rn but I feel there’s long term potential. We both are kind to one another, financially responsible, want the same things in life, ultimately can see a future together. He has made some changes when I brought up boundary issues but not the prioritizing us as a couple.

Black coffee is easy mode, because automatic processes don't produce mess, and you don't have to clean up anything, so I was able to understand how end game builds have to do a continuous flow, particularly in turbo made.

Coffee Tables were probably a waste, but I don't know how I would use that space, especially since 2 tables worked so fine anyway.

1gczuam,https://www.reddit.com/r/moviereviews/comments/1gczuam/memoir_of_a_snail_review/,Memoir of a Snail Review ,"Memoir of a Snail is the first feature-length movie from director/animator, Adam Elliot, in 15 years. His last movie was the critically acclaimed, Mary and Max, and Memoir of a Snail is very much in the same aesthetic. It's a stop motion animated film, but it has a grungy visual style to match its more adult themes. There's a yellowish tint to the whole movie, like the film reel was used as a urinal cake. Whereas in another stop-motion movie, you might have adorable little figures of coffee mugs, violins, and cute bunny rabbits, Memoir of a Snail has little replicas of greyhound busses, topless old ladies, and snail semen. The style sort of reminds me of a stop-motion Ed Roth/Rat Fink. But for as much as Elliott likes to play in the stylistic dirt, the movie itself is incredibly heartfelt. It's sincere without ever being sentimental, and morbid without ever embracing depression.

1gczu7h,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpooktacularTales/comments/1gczu7h/last_night_was_great/,Last Night Was Great,"My head pounds as I stumble into the world of the waking.  There’s a dull throb behind my eyes, my mouth tastes like week-old sweat, and my tongue is absolutely parched.  Altogether, I’m hungover as shit, and my memories of last night are a mix of blurred moments and blank spots.  I want to go out, get breakfast, throw it up, and go get lunch.  By then I should be feeling better, but my entire Saturday will be shot.  

I check my phone, Matt wants to hang out, Bryan’s pissed at me for something I don’t remember doing last night, Harrison says he wants to get breakfast, and someone texted “remember me?”  The message is accompanied by a picture.  She’s hot.  I can already feel the headache fading as my body refocuses.  

A second message pops up, “From the party last night?”  I met up with someone that looked like that?  Damn, I wish I could remember what happened last night.  I dimly remember exchanging numbers a couple times.  But those could’ve been other parties.  

After a few moments of indecision, I text her back, “Of course, what’s up?”

“Are you still going to buy me breakfast today?”  Doesn’t ring a bell.  “My car’s in the shop so can you pick me up? ;)”

Something seems off, but since Linn stopped talking to me, I’ve gotten desperate. “Sure, I’ll take you wherever you want.” 

“Okay, here’s my address… It’s a little outta the way, but I’ll make it worth your while\~”

Out of the way is right, it’d be practically an hour drive to pick her up.  But… I can’t stop looking at that picture.  I agree immediately.  

I text Harrison back as well, “I found someone better looking to get breakfast with…” And I send him a picture of the girl.  

“No way, you’re full of shit.”  He texts back.

I just respond by sending him a screenshot of my whole conversation with… the girl. What’s-her-name.  

It’s a long car-ride, but after a couple bottles of Gatorade and Tylenol my headache is somewhat abated.  What’s-her-name seems to be living in some sort of partially developed housing community.  It’s full of half-built homes, abandoned construction sites, and unpaved roads.  She seems to have the only completely built home, maybe her family is constructing the neighborhood or something?

I feel a trickle of fear in the back of my mind while I walk up the driveway.  It’s creepy being in an empty neighborhood like this.  But, what do I have to worry about?  I’m not rich or famous.  There is a sign taped to the front door, “The key’s under the cactus, I’m waiting XOXO”.  I fling the door open as fast as I can.

The inside isn’t as complete as you’d expect.  The stairs to the second floor aren’t built, and the tile only covers part of the floor, leaving an obvious path.  I follow it through to a dusty kitchen, which has a fridge full of water bottles.  Past that is a dark hallway, with a well-lit room on the other end.  As I walk down it, someone calls out to me, “Greg is that you?  I’m just down here.”  I hurry down the path.  Upon closer inspection, I see that the door opens onto another short hallway, I turn down that to find the girl, sitting behind a small office desk smiling at me.  

“Hey, I got here as soon as I could.”  I flash her my best smile.  

She just sits there, holding the same smile. I take a couple steps closer. 

“You ready for breakfast,” I stop and turn around, “oh wait, I kind of have to go to the bathroom.  Y’know it was a long drive.  Where is it?” I spin back around to face her.  

She just sits there.  Face frozen.  I get closer.

“Hello?”  I wave my hand in front of her face.  She doesn’t even blink.  

I carefully reach out a single finger and poke her smiling cheek.  It’s firm.  Dead cold.  I turn around to run and the floor gives away beneath me.  After an endless moment of falling, I stiffly land in a swimming pool full of sponges and foam wedges.  I flail about in it, but eventually get to the edge and pull myself out.  The only exit is a single, unlocked door.  The next room is dark but I walk into it anyways.  The solid metal door slams shut behind me and locks with a loud click.  Like that my brain seems to finally kick in gear and I realize the position I’m in.  This must be some sort of murder house, and I’m trapped in the basement.  With monumental effort I avoid pissing my pants.  But I’m unable to stop the tears from welling up in my eyes.  I quickly pull out my phone, no signal of course.  So, I weakly call out, “hello?  Is anyone there?”  

The lights blink on with a blinding flash.  The room is plain.  Linoleum floors, plastic sheeting covers the walls, and another single, metal exit door.  Fluorescent lights buzz softly overhead.  I start to call out again, when a speaker crackles to life, “This is a recording.  The woman from the photograph is alive and in one of the rooms up ahead.  Find her and make it to the exit before you’re caught, and you’ll be set free.”  

“What?” 

The recording loops again.  I don’t know what’s going on, I try the door in front of me, and slowly push it open.  What greets me is a murder scene.  Endless hallways of walls covered in bloodstained, plastic sheeting.  There’re numerous rooms branching off, but half of the doors look to have been yanked out of their frames.  In some places the fluorescent lighting is even broken open, allowing the bare bulb to blare down.  There’re bits of metal and glass, crumpled doors, shoes, and even bits of torn clothes littering the hallway.  I think I hear a loud thumping somewhere in the distance.  I creep a short way down the hallway and pick up a particularly sharp looking piece of metal.  Now armed, I try searching for the mysterious woman, hopefully she knows how to get out of here.  

All I find are empty rooms.  Some of the doors don’t even seem to work.  The place is huge, or I’m walking in circles.  After a bit I decide to go to the bathroom in one of the empty rooms.  With that frame of reference, I realize I’m looping.  All the hallways are connected in one big circle.  But, there’s one door I missed, I slam it open, and see the girl from the picture.  Well, it kind of looks like her.  She’s a bit of a mess and looks older.  “Hey, what’s going on here?”  I demand, clasping my knife tightly.

“That door is locked,” she points behind me, “that door leads to the exit,” she points behind herself, “but it’ll kill you before you reach it.”

“What?”

“You are the next in a very long line of meals for a very picky eater.”

“But, the exit?”

“Yes, I’ll be happy to guide you, just please stay still when it finds you.  It’s very… *loud* with the ones that try running.”

She opens the door and my heart immediately drops.  The blood and viscera look fresh.  There’re even bits of something I don’t want to look at closely stuck in the drains spread out along the floor.  The stench is rancid, and I try covering my nose to block the smell.  The door locks loudly behind us.  I stick closely to the woman as we walk down the hallway.  I glance into one of the open room and see clothes covering the floor.  They’re arranged in heaps like bedding or some sort of nest. 

I grab the woman’s shoulder, “what’s going on?”

She brushes me off and keeps charging ahead, “I told you, they’re feeding a picky eater, and you’re the meal.”  

“But, what do I do?  I don’t wanna die?”

“Look,” she points down the hall, “around that corner is the exit.”  A loud roar echoes from somewhere nearby.  “It’ll be obvious, but you won’t make it in time.”  

“Well, let’s go, don’t you want to escape?”

“I’ve been here for *years*.  There’s no way out.”

“What does that mean?”

She rubs her head, “There’s only one exit, think it through.”  

“Wha-” I’m cut off by an inhuman roar.  I hear the heavy thumping of meaty feet on the hard plastic floor and turn around.  Something is getting closer.  The lights flicker overhead as it looms around a corner about twenty feet back.  I immediately bolt towards the exit.  After a few seconds I hear a loud shriek, and it takes every ounce of control to not turn around.  Its pounding footsteps quicken; it’s seen me.  I spy a door around the bend, is that the exit?  The handle is caked in blood, and there’s stains all along the bottom of the door.  I immediately try the knob, it won’t open.  Shit, did I need to bring her here?  Where is she?  I turn around.  The monster looms over me.  It’s covered in thick fur, with two massive arms and a torso that’s mostly teeth.  Every muscle in my legs flex in perfect synch to flee as quickly as possible.  There’s another bestial bellow and I push myself to run just a little faster.  

I turn another corner and sprint down the hall.  I fling a door open at random and dive inside.  Should I hide?  Wait, I grip my rudimentary knife.  Adrenaline floods my veins.  Could I kill it?  I step into the hall and look down the path at the massive beast.  Charging it with this thing would be suicide.  But… It looks pretty stupid.  Could I get it to run into this knife?  

The beast starts its charge, hairy feet slapping the hard floor.  I’m calm, I know exactly what to do.  I step out of the room and cooly spin around, kneeling down to point my makeshift knife right towards the monster’s stomach.  I watch as it charges right towards the open door behind me.  I’m a little out of the frame, so while my arms may be at risk, the rest of me should be safe.  It must see the knife, but it doesn’t deviate at all.  I dimly realize that its feet are also hands.  But, I’m calm, I’m cool, I’m not panicking, I’-

Searing pain erupts through me.  All rationale thought erased for one blissful moment.  I lay their gasping.  I frantically try to move my arms but nothing happens.  I look down to see they’re utterly shattered from the elbow down.  Loose mush.  I hear pounding footsteps.  The beast stalks into the room and steps directly on my now-bent knife without flinching.  I try to crawl away.  My arms screech in protest as I put my weight down on broken elbows.  I can’t do anything but cry as it drags me back into the hall.  My face is a mess of snot and tears as I’m pulled all the way back to the exit.  It drops my feet onto the floor and walks back down the hall.  I look up and see the woman is standing nearby. She shakes her head and walks away.  I watch her go, and I’m dumbfounded to see the beast do nothing to stop her.  Once she’s gone, it lets out a triumphant roar and starts charging towards me once more.  

What did I do to deserve this?  What is it going to do to me?  Wh-

Harrison’s phone buzzes while he’s having his morning cup of coffee.  It’s not a number that’s immediately familiar to him.

“Hey, Greg gave me this number.  He was kind of lame, but it sounds like you’re pretty cool.  Wanna get lunch sometime?”  A picture pops up as well.  It’s the same girl Greg showed him last week.  

Harrison frowns, this is strange.  He knows Greg’s not the type to hook his friends up with girls he likes.  And she’s using the exact same picture she sent Greg.

I was really not ready for a relationship when we started dating. 

We had some pretty complicated circumstances including her moving in with me about 6 weeks into our relationship due to her mom filing bankruptcy and having to move across the country to live with my girlfriends grandparents. My mom had left when I was younger and I know how much it hurts to leave everything you know especially at 19. We became very codependent but still had time with our friends and our own lives. 

Pretty soon we started having small fights due to the complications of moving in together so fast but we fought really hard to work things out. We had tried an open relationship at one point and it did not work so we both agreed to be monogamous (I hooked up with an ex which we had agreed not to do. I regretted it instantly but take full responsibility for my actions. Although in my head I did it because I knew I could cut this person off and that I would not communicate further but that’s beside the point. It hurt her. We then went on a trip to NYC and she told me I could hook up with this girl and then after she treated me very negatively but I would not have done it if she said no and really only did it because she encouraged it because she wanted to spend time with her really close friend from home.) 

I’m just giving this background to help explain where her lack of trust in me started. I had a lot of avoidant tendencies in the beginning and some aspects were present throughout our relationship. 

She had moved to another town about 8 months into us dating and began going to community college. I was worried about the distance but I would bend over backwards to come visit her even with my extremely stressful work schedule. I truly love her despite my words sadly not always meeting my actions. When I felt unheard in the relationship I developed a bad habit of threatening to end it due to her refusing to change certain things.

 Since the beginning of our relationship if she would yell at me or try to fight and was disrespectful or mean I would ask for space (15-30 minutes) to calm down so I don’t fuel the fire. She was never able to give me this space which due to some of my trauma made me feel cornered and escalate fights sometimes leading to me threatening the relationship. I want to make my negative behaviors very clear but I recognize that I loved her throughout these tough times but I struggled with fully letting my walls down because of how much I was into her and I was scared of getting hurt. 

Our relationship started getting better. She had a Roomate in the apartment she lived in when she was going to community college that had to move out due to family reasons so for the second semester she moved back in with me after deciding she wanted to take a semester off and attend a four year school. The clashing of responsibilities, stress, money and our own personal mental healths started again.

 I had gotten into therapy by this time and was encouraging her to find a therapist as well because we both really wanted a life with each other and she was very clear she wanted a life and family with me. (Looking back, I recognize that is a big thing to say at 19 but I really trusted her word and that it was what she wanted.) 

at some point due to all the fighting we became very on or off. Like we’d have 4 good days, then 2 bad days on and on. But we both still loved each other. 

Finally this past July i had asked for a break after she told me to shut the fuck up and when I tried to go calm myself down and get a coffee so we wouldn’t fight she chased me into the yard and was hitting my car as I was leaving. I love this person so much and am so disappointed in my negative actions as-well as hers that got us to this point. I asked for a break because I couldn’t allow myself to be like this with someone i care about. 

She then after about a week came and got all of her things from my house and told me she couldn’t do this anymore. I understood but was ofc sad. 

I then got a call from my best friend who told me she was at my house with some dude. So I took my lunch break at work due to not wanting some random dude in my house. It turned out to be her guy friend who while I was uncomfortable with I never had a reason not to trust and didn’t want to be that type of partner to say what she can and can’t do. Realizing it was him I was like “oh okay” and then she started telling me all the things she had been bottling up via yelling. This prompted her friend to go wait in his car (he has a suburban so it was easier to move all of her stuff out in his car). We both started going back and fourth and it got pretty nasty. She left calling me all types of names and telling me she’s going to go fuck other people which hurt. But I accepted that she was done ya know?  

About 2-3 weeks later she calls me and tells me she doesn’t want to do this with anyone else and really wants to focus on fixing things. I love her and as a result asked her if she could come over and talk with me about it. We decided to try again. 

All of my negative behaviors pretty much subsided at this point. When we got back together things were going really well and we were communicating more. I would get slightly jealous when she would go out with friends 4-5 times a week and not invite me however because of the fact she was leaving for school in September. 

I want to also add that I work 7 days a week, let her live with me for free and paid for basically everything. Not that it’s about those transactional things but it does hurt when you go above and beyond to try and give someone things to feel comfortable and they don’t consider inviting you to things. She had also crashed her car about two weeks before school so I dropped 2k and completely rebuilt the front end so she could have her car at school. 

We were really happy all things considered the fighting was getting better and we were more communicative. 

Then she went to school. 

The one thing I had emphasized the importance of was communication. She went from talking to me all the time to very delayed responses and never calling. Mainly this concerned me because it was off of the baseline of how we interacted our entire relationship. During the first two weeks she called me a total of about 10 minutes. I had then explained that I’m really freaked out about how distant she was being and she came and visited me and told me it was going to be okay. 

Then after another week of the same type of communication I told her I cannot really continue this dynamic as it’s causing me a lot of anxiety and stress and I didn’t think it was too much to ask to communicate. Like one time she didn’t respond for 6 hours and her reason was because she was smoking weed with her new friends. Which to me doesn’t make it hard to respond to a partner you said you want a life with and professed your love to so many times. 

It got to the point where I felt discarded. Whether that is valid or due to my own internal problems I am unsure. But it made me cry like damn we put all this work into making this relationship better and then boom. 

I told her I don’t know if we should go our separate ways or not but I am really worried about our relationship and need to take a break so I can at least get used to this new communication dynamic. Due to me threatening the relationship many times in the past she put her foot down and said no this is a breakup and I’m not sure if we’re ever getting back together. I was devastated. I was unsure of how in three weeks we went from talking about where we want to move and a family to this point.

 I had reached out about a week later to ask her if she wouldn’t mind getting her things from my house because it was making me sad to look at. She refused and told me not to touch any of her things. She then told me I belong in an institution and just said a bunch of nasty things that hurt a lot. I said maybe in another life and she told me she would never choose me. She also had said she had been unhappy for a long time and brought up the things I wrote in the beginning of this post. I said “so you got back together with me and basically just used me for housing?” She said “I did what I had to do.” I was really hurt. 

About a week after that she texted me and apologized for saying all of those things and told me she still loves me and is just unsure about everything right now. I’m trying to be understanding because I know college is a big life change and it can make you question everything but I am still hurt by the things she said. 

She called me one morning and begged to see me. I was very opposed but she cried until I did. She then cried until I’d buy a hotel and sleep with her. After this she told me she had kissed a guy at a party and I saw that she had tinder downloaded which kind of bothered me because she waited until after we had sex to tell me this she also told me she would delete tinder if I wanted which I asked her to and have no way of confirming if she did or not. On the way to bring me back to my town she told me she loves me and said “I’m coming back, I just need time” later that day she sent me a song and told me she wants it to be played at our wedding. 

My head at this point is beyond confused. I dream about her almost nightly and she’s the first and last thing on my mind before and after bed. Now she keeps reaching out and I tried to explain to her that it hurts when she tells me she loves me and all of this stuff followed by I’m not sure if you’re right for me. I asked if we could go no contact due to how much it was effecting my life until she made a decision but she will still contact me every one to two weeks saying that she misses me and just needs time to decide how she feels and that it’s hard for her not to run back to me. It’s very confusing. 

Some of my friends think she is using the past to justify the wedge she drove between us to hook up with people in college but keep me as a safe option. I asked her about this and she said if she was trying to do me dirty she would’ve already slept with someone else. I haven’t done anything with anyone and don’t think I could for a very very long time as truly she is the only person I am interested in and want to fix things with. It sucks because if its truly about the past I was avoidant for the first half then changed and now she resents me for the past.

 I told her if she’s going to keep talking to me that she should at least be able to agree to make an effort to work things out at some point (she said it could be up to a year and I agreed to wait that long) and she said she was willing to. My point was if I cannot even ask you to try again at some point I think we shouldn’t contact each other until you’re sure of what you want. 

I am doing so many positive things for myself. I have read multiple books on self growth, relationships and been in the gym a lot. I lost a bunch of weight and have been cooking all of my food at home paying down my debt. My life is really good right now minus all of this stuff with my ex. 

I am just concerned of the potential that my unwavering love for her has the potential to allow me to be picked up and dropped by her and lead on. Like I do want to talk to her but when she calls and we talk for two hours and she tells me she loves me followed by a week of radio silence it is very confusing. 

I did make a lot of mistakes in our relationship but I truly have been putting in the work to improve myself and my self esteem to facilitate a healthier dynamic with her. 

I encourage her independence and think regardless of what happens with us that this was a needed break due to how codependent we had become. She struggled with picking restaurants, advocating for herself and knowing what she wanted out of life despite my attempts to facilitate these things and I think her new environment is a really good place for her to become more independent. 

I just hope I’m not getting played and I’m really struggling with the rumination of it all and that I’ve never been so committed to anyone and they’re completely unsure of where I fit into their life. Any advice would be greatly appreciated thank you for taking the time to read this.

I don't have much to go on, so here's hoping.

There's a song I'm trying to remember from I think the early 2010s. I used to listen to the song on youtube. There are two main versions that I remember, both live performances. One is the artist in what looks like a church basement, sitting behind an electronic keyboard. The other is in a brightly lit coffee shop, the view showing outside onto the street. The coffee shop is crowded.

The artist is a young white man, small build. The song begins with him looping a kind of lo-fi relatively slow drum track. He then plays big chords on the electric keyboard, kind of pulsing with the drums. The vocals are tenor/low tenor and are incredibly expressive. One lyric I think I remember is ""too close"" in a chorus maybe? The vocals convey sadness and desperation as I remember.

Sorry for the lack of detail here, these are what remain of memories from before I got sober.

Took me a total of 5 irl days, where I played between 2 or 4 hours each time. A total of 163 Nook Miles Tickets.
And a lot of hope, patience,  and frustration as well as laughter and a lot of new villagers that I've met for the first time. This truly was an experience. 

The slideshow today shows my first meeting with Fang and what followed theresfter - a truly great day!! 

I prepared the eares around his house (and oh what a house he has omg!) 
In the morning of Fang's arrival only one other villager was awake, my best friend Henry! I think he felt threatened by the fact that a wolf had joined or home because he was crafting a plate armor 😭🤣
I made a tiny snowboy❄️
I got nerdy with my friends while working hard to get the island in better shape,
I talked it out with my (in game) ex Dom to make sure we were on good terms before I would welcome Fang to the island, but he just tried to get me back with him & he wasn't subtle, y'all...and I ran hahah because jiikes that was awkward. I love Dom but it just didn't work between us 🙈 🤷‍♀️
Also Avery was at the Roost for the first time so we had coffee together 😸☕

I haven't really played much today after this because I also finally happened to have a great day irl! Me and my partner went on a double date with our friends to a Magical Samhain's Fair and it was super busy but also super cozy and fun! 🎃💞 Life's been super messy and difficult for a long time and these past weeks has been especially heavy on me, so ACNH has been a safe space for me and sharing my search for this lovely wolf has brought me a lot of joy because so many of you also enjoyed it💖🥰

So I'm the kind of people who drank from a very young age. Basically I'm french and I had my frist drink (champagne) at 12 (it's young yes I know), my parents only drink rhum, and there's me in the family: I don't mind drinking anything (except vodka, this shit tastes like ethanol, you know when you smell hand sanitizer ? That's what vodka tastes to me, it's f-ing awfull). So yeah I'm just used to 40% (50% sometimes for Rhum from Guadeloupe or Martinique) stuff bc rhum and my parents. (I don't really like wine (a sin for a french person)) bc it's a low % (like 9% to 14%) but the glass is so big you just fill it up and drink 3 glasses and you're in bed for 10h.

For maybe a year now, I've been drinking mostly whisky, cheap ones from supermarkets (Label or Campbell), with ice all the time; and well, whisky just tastes sweet to me. Maybe I'm used to rhum (I drink some from time to time (Charette, Old Nick, Damoiseau, UTC)), so I'm used to 40% stuff, but still, I'd love something else.

  
For some background, I love coffee, and liquor, if I want to I can taste the differents flavors. 

I prefer a simple blunt/pure whisky, which can be coupled with ice, not too expensive, the bottles I get are often 15-20€, which isn't much compared to the rich guy collecting on here, but still.

We've been broken up for around 6 months and I haven't moved on at all, missing her had just gotten worse and worse. 

She didn't give me a real reason as to why she ended things and I haven't been able to let go of hope. I've made major changed in my life like losing 40kg in that time.

I'm going to ask her if she's open to meeting me for a coffee as I want her advice on a few things. She's on of the smartest people I know, has a similar ND diagnosis to me and has first hand experience with some of the things I want to try and explore in life.

I would be lying if I said I don't also hope that seeing the major changes in person might help win her back somehow and she knows me well enough that she'd probably see right through me if I lied to her about that.

Please wish me luck but I also do know that there's a much higher chance she ignores me, rejects me or is dating someone else.

I will start with the “Easy Method” and finish with the “Slightly More Inconvenient Method.”

EASY METHOD  
You are going to need two things:  
1. A Google/Gmail account that has not been used in the Google Play Store.  
2. A VPN Program for your phone.  
Start by setting your VPN to the Philippines.  This is the only region I know of that has access to the game.  After doing so open the Google Play Store and login to the unassociated account.  Go to Settings -> General -> Account Device and Preferences -> scroll down to “Country and Profiles” to verify that the account will be set to the Philippines.  After setting the account to the Philippines search the store and the game should be there.  You will be required to set a payment method to the account, however the game is free so after inputting a credit card, PayPal account, or other and downloading GCGC you can remove the payment method.  Congratulation on enjoying your newest download!

SLIGHTLY MORE INCONVENIENT METHOD  
it will be nearly the same method as above with the exception that you will be using an account already used on the Google Play Store.  Follow the step above up to the point of “Country and Profiles.”  When trying to switch an account already associated with the USA to the Philippines I was unsuccessful and met with constant error messages.  If you are successful then congratulation!  Being able to find GCGC is dependent on your account being switch to the Philippines.",1,1729991052.0,GoodPizzaGreatPizza,0,1.0,False

We were coworkers before we started talking; we’ve known each other for longer as friends but got closer this year. I’ve been taking it slowly with her since I’ve never quite known what to make of her, romantically speaking.

Now she has this guy who has been her best friend for 14 years; far longer than I’ve even known her. We’ll call him Jordan. Jordan tried to get with her before I did and she gave him a chance. But from what she told me, he apparently had a rough past and because of it, he accused her of various red flags, despite knowing her as long as he did. So they broke up. I was proud of her for her choice and expressed how f’ed up it was that he jeopardized 14 years of friendship.

Fast forward some weeks later. Jordan’s messaging her again. And for some reason she’s not stopping him. Furthermore, once this happens, her messages to me become more and more infrequent. Once I’m able to get coffee with her, all she’s able to talk about is him. On her phone the whole time, his name on her notifications, and she’s not very invested in me at all like I am in her. 

Eventually, a few days after our coffee outing, who else do I just so happen see out with her? Jordan. The man of infamy himself. And she never got back to me that day until much, much later in the day. Needless to say, I’m very confused and annoyed. A part of me tried to warn me that she just wasn’t seeing me in the same way I saw her, and had eyes for him instead. But I guess it just took seeing it for me to truly believe it. 

Don’t get me wrong, I’m not about to say that it should be me and not Jordan. I honestly don’t care much at this point. He can have her. What I’m upset about is how lied to and played this whole thing has me feeling. I’m probably gonna stop considering her romantically at this point. Regardless of what’s actually happening, worrying about this isn’t worth my peace.

From my experience, men like Jordan don’t usually change for themselves, let alone their crushes. But I can only hope he proves me wrong for her. I don’t hate her. And if they do get together I truly hope they do well. I just might not want to hear about it lol.

I wandered by last night to sit for a second and maybe enjoy a sandwich, but it was SO LOUD outside and inside! 

To be clear, Yonder is never very loud, even when they have a DJ in there, the music is at a very comfortable volume. So, this was a shock. Turns out there's a new bar/lounge that's taken shape in the upstairs part of the building. Generally, I have exactly 0 issues with bars in the area. Even the indoor bars can rarely be felt through the walls of their neighbors. This one though? Shaking the walls. 😭 My favorite thing to do at Yonder is sit with a good book and read. I can read through a lot of noise, but I feel like there's a limit. 

I want this new lounge to succeed cause small businesses absolutely deserve a fair chance 100% to build their clientele and relationships with other business owners. But according to their Instagram, they'll be open from 3pm to 2am every single day. Like come on 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭, just turn down the music pleeeeeaaaassseeeeeeee. There's other businesses that share the building. There's even another dedicated bar space on the ground floor that doesn't do that. 

I really hope this reaches the owners because I don't smoke or anything, but I have friends who do and this could be a good spot, but I don't want to lose my current favorite coffee shop (one of the few that are actually open late) to gain another bar. 

Yes, this is a rant. No, I don't want them to close. Yes, I understand the concept of a club. No, I don't think it's fair that for a new business to succeed, they have to ruin the business of someone else. In an ideal world, they'll do some speaker testing to find the sweet spot for their sound in coordination with the owners of Yonder. ",8,1729990947.0,bullcity,2,0.7,False

Hi everyone,

I'm 35M and have been taking dexamphetamine for about two months now. I take 3 x 5mg tablets around 5am and 1 more at lunchtime. Initially, my doctor prescribed me 2 x 5mg daily, but I didn’t feel much, so we adjusted the dosage.

Here’s what I’ve been experiencing:

Morning dose (15mg at 5am): About 30 minutes after taking it, I feel a huge surge of focus and motivation. I feel great, like I just want to dive into learning or get stuff done.

After an hour: It’s like night and day. The intense focus is gone. I still feel something, but it’s much weaker.

Caffeine fix: I try to get back to that “focused” place with coffee, but it doesn’t really hit the same way.

Lunch dose (5mg around 11am): I feel a little boost, but not as much as the morning dose. After that, I tend to feel agitated or frustrated for the rest of the afternoon.


My question is:
Am I supposed to feel that big hit of focus and dopamine all day, or is that just how it feels at the start of treatment? I’m wondering if this is normal or if I should talk to my doctor about adjusting my dosage/timing.

Thanks in advance for any advice or similar experiences!
