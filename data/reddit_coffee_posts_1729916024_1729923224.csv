Hi friends. I’ll cut through it as quickly as possible: In my 30s. No history of addiction (prior to kratom). Physically fit. Husband and father. High performer and highly visible leadership job role. All of that to say: I was instructed that Kratom was merely a nootropic and/or pain-relieving supplement, and after 5 years of heavy use (upwards of 40gpd at one point) and several failed attempts to quit (ranging from one week to one month) I was shocked at what my life had become. My story is similar to most.

Then I quit.

Today is day 50 for me. I don’t know how you celebrate your milestones, but since I have gained so much help and hope from this sub, I decided a while back that when I hit 50 days I would post all the advice that has helped me quit. Of course, you will have to pick and choose which ones work for you, but here are my 10 rules for quitting kratom. I’m writing them down with the hope that somebody out there will find strength, clarity and hope reading through them.

**Rule 1: You’re not trying to quit, you’re playing a game to see how much better your life can get.** This mindset shift was one of the biggest gamechangers for me in the midst of withdrawal. Give yourself some grace: for the first few days, you might have to simply “hold on for dear life” and “just manage to get by” and “just try to be done.” But sometime later, something changes in you. You catch a glimpse of your child’s face as a ray of afternoon light falls upon him, and you realize you haven’t felt that type of joy in years. And suddenly, you smile and the process even becomes fun. You begin to think: what else have I missed these last 5 years? What other new joys, like buried treasure, are waiting for me next week? How much better can life really get? Amazingly, you find yourself not just quitting, but stacking new habit on top of new habit, and almost shockingly you find your life becoming exponentially better.

It’s odd. Once you clean out one closet, you want to clean out the other ones too. Because it’s just so damn interesting to wonder how much you really can improve yourself and how much you really can enjoy life. I’m six’ish months out, and strangely I’m finding myself wondering about quitting caffeine too (something I never thought I would consider in my life).

**Rule 2: Withdrawal feels unfair when you’re in it, but it reveals itself as useful afterwards.** If you’re in the midst of withdrawals right now, you’ll just have to summon some faith to believe me while I type this. Because withdrawals can seem cosmically unfair. In fact, they make reality look like it’s structured in the most menacing way possible: finally I find something to make me momentarily happier or feel less pain in life (you say to yourself), and then I find myself paying for it with night sweats, restless legs, depression, brain fog, etc. as my brain slowly resets its dopamine balance. How is that fair? Why can’t I simply stop using a substance and simply have my dopamine balance set at level, without the pain of withdrawal?

There might not be an answer to this question that’s satisfying. I think there is though. It’s because the process of withdrawal is structured in such a way that we don’t emerge from it the same way we were before the drug. We emerge from it better than we were before. That’s because in withdrawal, life becomes so challenging that it forces us to develop new habits just to survive. For the sake of simply getting through the day, you find yourself praying, meditating, practicing breathing, practicing gratitude, journaling, exercising, lifting weights, whatever for the first time in a long time. And suddenly, when you emerge from withdrawal, you emerge as a combination of the person you were before the drug + the new habits you picked up because of withdrawal. You won’t actually become “the old you” again. You become a version of “the old you” that’s even better.

This is why, I think, former addicts end up being badasses, the best parents, the greatest leaders and the most innovative thinkers and artists in the world. They have been refined by the fire, and came out with new tools that make them masters in the world of sobriety. Perhaps this is your future too.

**Rule 3: The best supplements really are exercise and time.** A close runner-up for me has been meditation and (if I have to pick an actual supplement) ibuprofen. I tried the whole laundry list of supplements that everybody suggests, and if you find relief in any of them, I wholeheartedly encourage you to keep reaping those benefits. But personally for me, nothing accomplished anything for me besides hard exercise and time. If you’ve been a longtime lurker in this thread like me, you’ve probably read that enough times that it’s become a cliche. So maybe I can take it an inch deeper to be helpful.

There are two speeds of life that I’ve found to be incredibly lifegiving without kratom: HARD WORK and TOTAL REST. Hard work: blasting out tasks, being deeply engrossed in an activity, watching the weights get added on the barbell at the gym, challenging myself to bless three people at work during the day; being in “high gear” helps me not think about the green sludge. It’s awesome. Conversely, total rest is awesome too: practicing breathing, being deep in conversation with my family, deeply inhaling the steam from a fresh cup of coffee, lingering in prayer, journaling; these things are awesome too. Like Anna Lembke describes it, pain and pleasure are like a balance in your brain. Push on pleasure too much, and the brain will balance it with pain. Push on pain a little (in the gym), and the brain will balance it with pleasure. No guts, not glory; as they say.

The speed of life that makes me miserable without kratom is a third speed: laziness. It is neither hard work or deep rest, but a state of limbo. Sitting on the couch aimlessly. Scrolling through my phone. In this speed of life, I am not engrossed or at peace, and so I find myself getting frustrated whenever my kids or wife interrupt me. I would highly encourage you to stay away from being lazy (again, there’s definitely a grace period: for some a few days, for some a few weeks or months). So please, like so many other reddit users have said, I beg you to get in the gym. Get addicted to the runner’s high if you run. Get addicted to the pump if you lift. It’s awesome.

**Rule 4: View withdrawal as a blessing.** And as crazy as this sounds, do it to the best of your ability. Most modern westerners amble through life experiencing chronic existential boredom. My guess is that this characterized you while you were regularly dosing kratom. You experienced a brief (and superficial) lift, and after that fleeted away, the gloom settled in and the boredom started to itch. Rather than making the hours count, you counted the hours until the next dose.

The beautiful thing about withdrawal is that it gives you no opportunity for existential boredom. You find yourself in a war. Life becomes filled with meaning. Everything is no longer amoral: there are good decisions and bad decisions, which is helpful, because it helps you engage in the arena of your soul.

I’m going to type something crazy, but please stay with it for a moment: I sometimes miss aspects of withdrawal. In that week or two, life didn’t feel like “Office Space” or “Groundhog Day.” It was filled with highs and lows; extraordinary bursts of joy and deep bouts of grief, and this gave life incredible contrast and distinction. I found myself listening to a song I’d heard one hundred times before, but it was as if I was listening to it for the first time. The song would make it’s way into my bones, and I’d find myself tearing up. I learned that, in the last few years of my life, I wasn’t really “listening” or “hearing” anything in life. It all comes back to you though.

In withdrawal you live, like Teddy Roosevelt’s famous speech, like the man in the arena:

“It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.”

That’s you right now. You are the woman or man in the arena. And you are not like the cold and timid souls who know neither highs nor lows. What a blessing.

**Rule 5: Cross addiction isn’t always bad.** Cross addiction is only bad when you addiction-swap with another harmful substance. I would encourage you to practice cross addiction by swapping your addiction with a new goal, practice, or habit that is going to yield exponentially positive results. It’s very possible (and deliciously delightful) to get addicted to something that’s good for you and your loved ones.All of the sudden, you still find yourself taking your “daily doses” it’s just not kratom. Something a lot of people talk a lot about around here is going on walks around the block or outside. I agree. I would find myself thinking, “time for my daily dose!” but rather than shoveling dry powder down my throat, I would go on a walk around the block. And the clarity, my goodness the clarity!, was stunning. Suddenly the leaves on the trees were greener than I ever remembered. The afternoon light dripped through the trees. Just breathing the fresh air was amazing. And somehow, I found myself (somebody who used to make fun of “walkers”) hooked and addicted to walking. But this addiction didn’t take from me, it gave back to me.

**Rule 6: Don’t ignore cliches.** A lot of people around here say different versions of the same things. And there’s a reason for that: most of the cliches you read around here are enduringly true. So don’t ignore them because you’ve read or heard them a thousand times: “Easy choices, hard life. Hard choices, easy life.” It’s true. “If you want freedom, you have to walk through the fire.” It’s true. “Quitting addiction is hard. Being addicted is harder.” It’s true. Learn from people on this sub!

**Rule 7: Quitting Kratom isn’t in the way of anything. It’s the way to everything.** My fear was that when I quit, my performance (at work, at home, socially, etc) would drop, and that kept me in a “doomloop” of constantly justifying the next dose: a social event, a public presentation, a long night of work, etc. I thought that quitting was the obstacle.

Ryan Holiday re-tells an ancient fable from a stoic in his book “The Obstacle is the Way” (buying this book is smarter than buying another bottle of supplements, by the way) and I’ll re-tell it quickly here: an ancient Roman Emperor became disgruntled one day by how soft his people were becoming. So he had heavy boulders placed at the entrance way of every exit/entrance to the city. Most people would simply try to push the boulder once or twice, and give up. Some would push longer, and then give up.But one visitor pushed and pushed and pushed. And then went out into the woods and cut down a tree and made a long wooden beam for leverage. And he used that beam as leverage to roll the boulder out of the way. And here’s the thing: not only did rolling the boulder out of the way gain him entrance into the city, there was also a bag of gold under the boulder with a note. The note said: “the obstacle is the way.”This is you right now. Keep pushing. Cut down the tree. Make the wooden beam. But I’m telling you: quitting isn’t in the way, it is the way. There is gold underneath this obstacle. Getting this obstacle out of the way will gain you entrance into the city you want to live in. Personally, I was shocked that my performance actually went up (maybe not the first week) in every area of my life after quitting. I was better at teaching, better at parenting, better at being a listening friend.

For my athletic quitters, my weightlifting IMMEDIATELY skyrocketed, even in the first week. I was shocked to discover that the pain in my shoulder that was getting in the way of my benchpressing immediately went away. I thought it was tied to some chronic pain in my life, but it was really just from the inflammation of heavy dosing. I couldn’t believe how I was putting more weight on the bar even in the midst of withdrawals. In fact, 50 days later, my benchpress is actually higher than it was in my 20s or in high school. Sometimes, we need a wolf on our heels to push us to our full potential!

**Rule 8: Flushing it saves precious energy.** Anna Lembke has some great stuff to read about in her book “Dopamine Nation” (buy it, please) on self-binding methods. When I started my quit, I kept my leftover kratom in my basements for emergency situations. But a few days into the quit, I went downstairs and just flushed it. Two surprising things about that moment: 1) It was so damn powerful. I didn’t know how empowering it would feel to just flush it all down. It was a profoundly symbolic moment of me exerting my strength over kratom, and it almost felt like a ritual. I didn’t foresee that coming. 2) It freed up a surprising amount of energy. I didn’t realize how much mental energy I was wasting by simply keeping the kratom as an option. Whenever a hard situation arose, I also had to deal with the inner-turmoil of whether or not to take the powder. This is called the paradox of choice: having choices, by necessity, causes anxiety. When it’s flushed and gone, you don’t have a choice anymore. And paradoxically, that’s freeing.

**Rule 9: Don’t force life; receive life.** You will have to find the root reasons why you sought this powder out in the first place, and willingly dug yourself into a deep hole. For me, quitting was primarily an exercise in acceptance. For the first time in my life, there were domains of my life that were outside my control. It felt amazing to simply push a button (or swallow a mouthful of powder) and experience a result. All of the drug experiments done on mice are a perfect picture of what I was doing: pressing the lever over and over. Pressing the button over and over.

When you quit, you unplug that button. And while there are ways of activating the pleasure centers in your brain (again: exercise, running, lifting, good deeds, goals, relationships, etc), the easy button in life disappears. And what you need to learn to do is simply accept life as it comes your way. And this includes accepting the full spectrum of human emotions as they avalanche onto you: grief, happiness, sorrow, joy, melancholy, anger, boredom. There are some you prefer in this list, and some you don’t. That’s besides the point: they are all gifts to be accepted as information (to learn about your inner self) and human experiences (emotions that might feel bad, but actually make life rich and deep and worth living).

I was shocked at how much emotion was being shoveled onto me while I quit. I would find myself watching a tv show rapturously belly laughing for the first time in a long time. I would find myself in the middle of wrestling my son and giggling myself into oblivion. As beautiful as these moments were, I would find myself almost wanting to “control the moment” by dosing. The trick here, and I can’t overstate this, is to learn to sit under the waterfall of emotions and just enjoy it all. Just stand under the flood of feelings, and let them all rush over you and through you. Man, life is beautiful.

***Heads up: this last point is the most precious to me, but it also involves faith and religion. If you have no interest in faith or religion, I totally understand. I wish you well and I’m rooting for you. I just wanted to give you a heads up to opt-out of this last note. And please know that I’m not trying to evangelize you. I just know that when withdrawals were hard, I wanted peoples’ honesty. And this is as honest as I can be.***

**Rule 10: Receive grace.** There’s a big difference between mourning and condemning. Mourning is healthy: you have missed a lot these last few years. You have become a shell of who you were. You have become thin and gaunt and a shadow of your potential. Your family and friends have not received the best version of you. It’s right to mourn these things, so long as you are also willing to receive the radical grace that comes from God too. But do not condemn yourself. That leads to shame and beating yourself up, which will put you in a dangerous position.

Personally, I am a Christian. There are no other conceptions of God that I find more existentially satisfying to the problem of suffering than a God who takes on flesh, walks among the world he created, experiences the pain that we all bear, and dies in our place on a cross. Honestly, I can’t conceive of a distant, detached conception of God who looks down at me in my pain and suffering and thinks, “I wonder what that’s like?” The biblical and historical position of Christianity posits a God who looks down at us in our suffering (and yes, that includes your withdrawal and quitting) and has compassion on us and can say, “I know what that feels like.” He really can look at you right now in your shivering and shaking and sweating and say, “I know what that feels like.” Heck, he didn’t merely leave behind kratom for sobriety, he left behind heaven to come to earth: what was that withdrawal like? This is also the ironic beauty of the cross: it is more pain and anguish that we can imagine, and it qualifies Him to be trusted to empathize with us in all of our seasons of life.

He is not angry at you. He is not mad at you. He is not disappointed in you. As a forgiven child of his, He delights in you, sings over you, and exults over you. This is the beauty of “grace alone.” There truly is nothing we can do to earn this love, we simply stand underneath the waterfall of it all and receive it.

Anyways, my apologies about the essay length post. I’m a long time lingerer around here, and I’ve learned so much from these posts (I’ve regurgitated a lot of it right here!). I feel indebted to give back a little bit, so I hope these thoughts empower you to keep moving forward!

My long term partner believes I am almost most certainly noticeably autistic, many people remark on me being weird/awkward, and it was suspected when I was a child. 

I have issues discerning intent with everyone, but especially men. 

Honestly, I would assume men weren’t attracted to me, and that men asking for my number just wanted a friend. No, I am not joking. Also, I wouldn’t know what to say because they weren’t explicitly asking to be my boyfriend, and I didn’t to be rude and assume that’s what they wanted from me. 

Sometimes I’d wonder, if a man asks for your number, does that mean he’s attracted to you? And I’d think, I don’t want to assume that he’s attracted to me because he didn’t say that he was. 

Thus, I’ve given my Instagram to customers asking for it at my job because I didn’t want to be awkward and assume they were flirting. 

Usually nothing would come from it, one time I gave my number to a man who was chasing me down the street, I thought he was a bit overzealous about wanting to be my friend. My boyfriend handled him for me because even I felt creeped out (and for me it is hard to tell). 

I’ve given my number to a guy at a coffee shop who let me sit next to him when the tables were all full, and held a conversation with me that didn’t have any comments I registered as sexual. I then thought he just wanted to befriend me, thus when he asked my living situation I said I live with my boyfriend and his family. Obviously he never said anything afterwards. 

I hung out with much older men when I was a teenager and duck out when it got unambiguously creepy, because I didn’t realize their intentions with me.

I am guessing using a puck filter will fix the issue but I’m reluctant to add another step to my brewing process. 

I have a theory that this happens because the stock Micra tamper doesn’t extend to the edges of the basket and there’s a bunch of untamped grounds sort of stuck to the sides of the PF, which makes it easier for them to get sucked inside the group screen. So I’m thinking maybe instead of adding another step to my process I can just use a slightly bigger tamper?

1gcejwy,https://www.reddit.com/r/mystery/comments/1gcejwy/missing_the_search_for_lila_hayes/,Missing: The Search for Lila Hayes,"On the night of October 10, 2023, a loud banging on the doors of Oakwood Apartments shook the residents awake. It was around 2 AM when Clara Barnes, who lived on the fifth floor, opened her door to find her neighbor, Jake Turner, looking panicked. “Lila’s gone! She didn’t come home!” he exclaimed, his voice shaky.

Lila Hayes, a 27-year-old graphic designer, had left her apartment that evening around 8 PM to grab dinner at a nearby café. When she didn’t return, Jake became worried. He said Lila always kept in touch and never stayed out too late.

Clara felt a knot in her stomach. She quickly agreed to help Jake search the building and the surrounding area. They knocked on other neighbors' doors, but no one had seen Lila since she left for dinner. Clara remembered that Lila often took walks in the neighborhood at night, and she thought it was strange that she hadn’t come back.

# The Investigation

After searching for a couple of hours with no luck, Clara and Jake decided to call the police. Officer Mike Reynolds arrived shortly after, taking their statements. “We need to gather more information about her habits and any possible trouble she might be in,” he said, trying to reassure them.

Clara told Officer Reynolds about Lila’s job and how she had been dealing with some stress at work recently. “She mentioned having issues with a co-worker named Greg,” Clara said. “They didn’t get along.”

Officer Reynolds nodded and promised to investigate. As the day went on, news about Lila’s disappearance spread. Clara took it upon herself to find out more. She checked Lila’s social media accounts and saw a message from Lila mentioning an argument with Greg. It raised Clara’s suspicions.

# The Search for Clues

Clara decided to contact Greg, hoping he could shed some light on the situation. They arranged to meet at a coffee shop nearby. When Greg showed up, he looked nervous. “I didn’t mean to upset her,” he said, avoiding eye contact. “We had a disagreement, but I didn’t hurt her!”

Clara felt something was off. She dug deeper and talked to other people at work who confirmed that Lila and Greg had been clashing over a project. Greg had been upset about Lila reporting him to HR for taking credit for her work.

Meanwhile, the police continued their search. They found Lila’s phone and purse near a park, which made Clara worry even more. It didn’t look good.

# The Big Break

On the third day of searching, Clara got a strange message online. Someone told her to check a spot in the park where Lila was last seen. Feeling hopeful, Clara rushed to the park and met with Officer Reynolds and other officers who were already there.

“Someone gave us a tip that she might be here,” Officer Reynolds explained as they searched the area. Suddenly, they heard a noise coming from some bushes. They rushed over and found Lila, shaken but safe. “I was hiding!” she said, looking scared. “Greg confronted me, and I panicked!”

Lila explained that she had run away and fallen into a thick area of bushes. The police quickly found Greg nearby, and he was arrested.

# The Conclusion

Lila’s disappearance made headlines, and many people in the community were relieved she was found safe. Clara was praised for her efforts to help, and the story sparked conversations about workplace harassment and safety.

Lila was grateful to be home and ready to speak out about what had happened. The whole experience reminded everyone that sometimes, danger can be closer than we think, but it’s important to look out for one another.",1,1729922624.0,mystery,0,1.0,False

Chapter 1
“This journal will detail the stories, adventures and records by Deckhands, for Deckhands. Each entry MUST have: your name, the date, and whatever information you feel is worthy enough to make it into this holy document.”

This was my very first entry into my new Deckhand Journal: A Deckhand’s Tale of the Sea. Funnily enough, I broke two of the three rules I highlighted in the first paragraph of the original journal, so I will fill in the blanks where necessary. The first thing you need to know is, who is the person writing all of this. Theodore is my name however, I will be referred to by various nicknames. Some of those include Dumbass and Meatball, as well as a whole other host of names convenient for those working around me who don’t want to learn my name or pay me any kind of respect. 
	
The second piece of information missing is the date. Sadly, this is harder to pinpoint, however I can confirm that it was sometime soon before June 12th, 2018, as that is the date of the following journal entry (thank you, Kiara, for following the rules of the book - she will be an important character later on). 
	At the time of writing, I would have been 20 years old, and in my second year as a deckhand at the glorious company known as Murphy’s on the Water. At the start of this season I already have a year under my belt and I’m thinking this year is going to be my year! I’m taller, more handsome, and just finishing up a great year at university where I’m finally really getting girls and gaining some confidence. Watch out world!
	Unfortunately, I was still living with my parents as I was home for the summer, leaving my apartment in my university town. This bump in the road was not going to stop me from enjoying the summer ahead. 

Before we continue you should know a few things about me: I like to talk, I mean, love to talk, socialize, drink, have fun and enjoy life. I’m a relaxed, go-with-the-flow, type of guy. Nothing bothers me except when there’s a job to do. This is the only “type A” personality trait I have; when something needs to get done, and my reputation (and money) is on the line, it is going to get done. This is exactly why Murphy’s was the perfect summer job, especially for me. 
	It might be important to add a description of my appearance, since my adventures with the ladies are a key component to this story. If you can imagine the most ordinary, white college boy in the world, you wouldn’t be far off. I am 5’11” and between 150-160 pounds, not huge but also not a shrimp. I’m also not lying about my height (you assholes, I can feel your doubt through the pages!). I have standard brown hair which gets flowy when I let it grow out, and a very normal face with a set of hazel brown eyes under a pair of thick, dark eyebrows. Aside from the biggest smile you will ever see, the one feature of mine that stands out the most is the abundance of freckles, which are peppered all over every inch of my skin that manages to glimpse any sunlight. 

I’m your classic guy who is a jack of all trades, good enough to get by, but never good enough to show off. 
I am essentially perfectly average in every aspect - besides my stunning personality, which undoubtedly has already been conveyed. My personality is what carries me over the line. Most of it is due to my crazy upbringing in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. The Darkside, the Dirty D, whatever you want to call it. For anyone who doesn’t know the area you can do you research, but who cares what they say. I love it here. 

People here have more character than your average bear. You need it to live and survive here, as we can’t really do all the fancy things those fakes do on the other side of the harbour, in Halifax. You need to have something going for you on this side of town. If you’re not funny, you might as well get outta town. Dartmouth, for those who don’t know, is the gritty, suburban, and less glamorous side of the Halifax Harbour. It’s a place where your street smarts, quick wit and jokes are a must if you want to survive here. This is what allows me to glide through the ups and downs of life, where otherwise people are beaten down. These are all reasons why Dartmouth is a great city, and there’s no place I’d rather be.

A question you might be asking yourself is Where, and what, is Halifax and this Dartmouth you call the “Darkside”? Well readers, it might just be the single best city in Canada, in my not-so-humble opinion. Halifax, Nova Scotia is the largest city in the Atlantic region of Canada (and at one point way back in history, one of the largest cities in the entirety of Canada), it’s the capital of Nova Scotia. Halifax isn’t really thought about by the rest of Canada, aside from students who want to attend university here. This is what makes Halifax awesome, it’s a hidden gem. Not many people live here that don’t want to be here. If you didn’t want to be here, you would have already left for better work, and you would have  hated your life somewhere else. 

People love this place and it’s not hard to see why, it has everything you could ever need. It has a compact old downtown filled with history and unique buildings, sitting on a beautiful harbourfront that flows into the Atlantic Ocean. There are old yet cool buildings previously deemed rundown. These places are being reinvented by hipsters, who somehow make the best coffee, beer and patio furniture one could ever find.

To maybe give Halifax it’s final bump. It has the 2nd most bars per capita in Canada. Having 40 000+ university students in the city may have something to do with that. The population is simply pleasant, polite, and easygoing. The Harbour is everything here in this city, and this is coming from a person who believed this even before he started working on boats. You could argue my love for the Harbour is a chicken and egg type of deal. I would have never worked on the boats if I didn’t think the Harbour was as cool as I think it is. 

There are a few reasons why I think the Harbour is crucial to the greatness of this city. First of all, the winters are not nearly as bad as most places in Canada, as the water prevents it from getting out-of-this-world cold, in the way most people associate with Canada. However, it creates very unpredictable weather. I have a theory that these weather 
patterns (or lack thereof), make people more apt to roll with the punches when life is unpredictable. 


These are the characteristics most locals have. And they were they were ones I had going into my first year at Murphy’s, although it was severely tested with all the nonsense this job throws at you. 

Now that all you really readers are familiar with the area. It’s time for that final piece of the puzzle. How did I find myself in this crazy place called Murphy’s? I ended up at Murphy’s the same way I seem to find myself in almost every situation in my life, by sheer coincidence. 

This time the coincidence was Eve. Fucking cousin Eve, the cousin who helped me choose which university I would be attending for the next four years of my life. She sold me on the parties, the food and the thing I cared least about, my degree. Credit to her recommendation , I had a spectacular first year so far. I was almost finished and about to pass every class. Her last piece of advice was to apply for this tourism company called Murphy’s.


At an Easter dinner she told me that I fit the bill of a classic Murphy’s deckhand. Whatever the fuck that meant. She told me to apply online as soon as possible as there was a job fair coming up and I would no doubt get a job for the summer. She wasn’t selling well enough so I decided to disregard her suggestion. I wanted to work as a server or bartender, all my buddies were doing this. This is where I thought the big bucks were made doing those roles in a restaurant. So I took half of her suggestion. I applied first for this Murphy’s place as a server, then as a back up I applied as a deckhand.


For those who don’t know Murphy’s is a combination of gift shop kiosks, a massive restaurant on the longest pier in the harbour, called the Cable Wharf, and last, but certainly not least, it owns wide variety of tour boats. The kiosks are corny, cheap,and touristy. If you read the yelp reviews the restaurant is “amazing”. In my opinion the food was average at best but that didn’t stop the tourists from flocking and being disappointed when they left. 

Thankfully, there the boats on premise to save the day. There were five different boats, and a handful of harbour hoppers, which were amphibious vehicles that operated both on land and in the harbour. These were the crowned jewels of the company they made hand over fist. But god damn were they boring. The people, the tours and the employees were fucking sandpaper.

The real fucking boats proceed as follows: The Harbour Queen, a beautiful Mississippi-style sternwheeler; the Kawartha Spirit, an all white, whale watching double decker; the Peggy’s Cove Express, a speedy fishing boat; Theodore the Tugboat, almost as if Thomas the Tank Engine was a tugboat instead of a locomotive with red colouring instead of blue; and the Tall Ship Silva, a massive three-masted schooner. They are the crowned jewels of this fantastically horrible place.

Now readers, I did tell you at the start that I would be frank with you, and tell the story responsibly, so I must admit…. I lied. The boats aren’t that great, realistically they’re falling apart and their tours are encompassed in deception. In my first year, the Kawartha’s engines blew up and its whale watch tour saw so few whales Murphy’s had to rebrand it as a “nature tour”; the Harbour Queen is commonly known as the Harbour Slut in Halifax because of all the raunchy late-night parties thrown on it; the Peggy’s Cove Express is so old it can no longer make it to Peggy’s Cove; and the Tall Ship Silva is not a real tall ship. It is technically a sailboat, although the way the sails are rigged, it cannot genuinely sail. Theodore the Tugboat is the only boat that does not deceive the public, but it’s geared towards kids so who cares. Hopefully, all this irony already exhibited in the boats will help foreshadow the wonderfully ridiculous nature that embodies the core of Murphy’s on the water. 

The one saving grace is that the boat staff are much more isolated than any other department in the company. This separation creates just enough of a disconnect so that everything that could go wrong will go wrong, almost all of the time. It also allows for more fun to be had, as the corporate heads of the company cannot mould all of the crew to fit into their perfect cookie cutter employee displayed on the travel brochures. There is also the additional contrast of the people who work on these boats; they are either supreme neat freaks or outright slobs in every aspect of work, life, and social settings. It is in this sort of chaos that I thrive.

Second, the water makes people want to have fun. It provides a location for activities you otherwise wouldn’t have if you lived in another city. Halifax is on the coast, with plenty of access to beaches where you can go swimming, surfing, and sailing. Most people around here like this sort of stuff.

After Eve, told me all this great information I did a little research. I discovered that the company would be holding a massive job fair in March, leading up to the season start in May. The instructions were simple: bring a resume, and for some reason prepare two stories; one of Halifax’s history, from which they selected a number of topics, and one of your choosing. The need to prepare a couple stories seemed strange to me, but I was unaware of what the job had in store regarding responsibilities. All the same, I began to prepare. 

My mom came and picked me up from university, and for the whole two hour car ride home, all we did was practice telling stories so I was prepared to crush this interview. I was definitely going to get this job. I wanted it desperately because one of my best friends, Jaggar, who attends the same university I do, was gunning for the same position. 
Jaggar is bananas, as he is an absolutely crazy, larger than life human, standing at 6’4”. With a booming voice and huge personality, he typically beats me to the punch on everything. If he were to get this job over me, I’d never hear the end of his crazy summer stories, being on the boats and talking to pretty girls. 
On the day of the job fair, we both arrive at the cold, wooden, unheated waterfront restaurant where they are conducting interviews. All of the managers of the various departments are sitting at tables with applicants for about 5-10 minutes, before the applicants move from table to table, talking to each of them. 
At this point I’m sweating it as I keep seeing good-looking people in their mid-20’s everywhere, and I’m this little, freshly 19 loser. Just as I’m getting this flash of self awareness and becoming nervous, my name is being called for my first interview, starting with a restaurant manager. Roxanne was her name, and the interview was a total bust. It was easy to see I had no idea what I was talking about, and I was quickly shooed away, only to hear my name being called by another person. 
This time it was a heavier set man, with dark hair half slicked back from his almost piggish face. Pierre was his name, and he was the manager of the boats and the captains. He was venting applications for the captains to “create good chemistry” on the boats - whatever the hell that meant. 
We sat at a small table that felt like it was about to break, the way Pierre was leaning on it. He began to ask general questions about my resume, but it was clear nautical questions were on the rise. So, as a man with zero knowledge of boats, I had one option - lie. 

Pierre called me over shortly and sat me down in a dark booth. He skipped every single pleasantries as if he had talked to 1000 guys my age. So I cut straight to the chase. I told him stories of sailing camps I never went to, knot tying I never did in scouts and the all the power boats my father wish he owned.
The stories were all fake, but my dad and brother both went to scouts so I bluffed the basics, and Christ almighty, it was working! Big manager Pierre was eating up what I was feeding him. Ten minutes passed and he told me to sit back down for a further interview. I’m pumped, but nervous, as the next interview might just start to expose all my well crafted lies. 
While I was waiting I googled names of knots, boats, nautical terms, you name it. I looked at everything I possibly could in five minutes. Like I said, I was not going to get turned down. In what seemed like two seconds since my last interview, my name gets called again, but by a different person.
Sitting at the back, in a booth, was a very tall, skinny, red haired man in a shirt that desperately needed to be tailored. The man in the booth is named Liam, and he will be a lurking character throughout my four years at Murphy’s. At every turn he was always constantly throwing wrenches into many of my plans. At the time, he was the manager of the deckhands, as well as some of the nautical operations in conjunction with Pierre.  
Liam took his turn asking the exact same beginner level nautical related questions Pierre asked during his interview. I gave him the same perfect  answer by lying right to his face. I told him I could tie many knots and knew the basics of sailing thanks to the same sailing camp I told Pierre about. Liam seemed very content with my answers. He never questioned a single explanation I gave and since there were no further questions from the two so called superiors I was free to leave.  After I left I felt as if I was a master of disguise. There was no way these guys believed me and my stories. I had to have given clues that I was full of shit and they must have sniffed it out. 

Regardless, it was worth a try. I had to go back to school to finish my first year of university. That was my first priority. They said I would know within a few weeks if I got it or not. I could find some summer job after my exams if I had too. 
Fast forward a couple of weeks and I got the email with the job offer, just as my final exams are ending. This is a huge weight off my shoulders. Jaggar received the same email and we were both thrilled to be potentially working together. We head home after school finishes and wait for a call to begin work, not knowing what we will be doing. 
It seems as though these calls will not be coming anytime soon, as day after day goes by without a word. In order to pass the time, Jaggar and I begin to gamble online, playing Blackjack in order to make just enough money to party with our friends, who have all started their jobs already. This was a terrible mistake, as we quickly started to burn through all of the money we had left from out first (and very expensive) year at university. Our bank account balances are getting very low, along with our morale, and any hopes of making enough money during the summer to pay for school. 
Just as I start to close in on my last couple hundred dollars, I get a call! Jaggar is pissed, as he still hasn’t heard a thing. I’m not told much, just that I am to report to the main Murphy’s gift shop for computer work. Now readers, this is the point of no return in this story. I was about to fully enter a world that would grip me for four summers, before nearly breaking me in the summer of 2020. The next chapters will be themed by individuals who have drastically shaped my time at Murphy’s",1,1729922349.0,writing,1,1.0,False

Friends and I went to restaurants, watched movies, coffee, that type of thing. I didn’t even really realize people did party in college (commuter student). 

Eventually my friendships faded out, and some friends that I still have would hide that they would go with other friends to party or go out to the bars/ clubs.

1gce9oh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gce9oh,Night & Day,"Man, last night was something else! That full moon had me howling like I was born to do it. The pull was stronger, like the moon was calling just for me. It’s strange, but there’s a thrill in letting go, in feeling the strength flow through every muscle, every bone, like I’m part of something bigger out there. Almost like I could touch the stars if I really tried. There’s a freedom in it—pure and wild, a kind of rush that no words can catch. And those Alpha eyes? Alright, I’ll admit, they were kind of badass. A little intimidating even, but hey, maybe I’ve earned a little intimidation!

And now? Well, here I am, just me again, sipping coffee, taking it all in. No fur, no claws, just good ol’ Cole, enjoying the morning with a damn fine cup of coffee. There’s something about these quiet moments that’s… magical, in a different way. The sunlight’s pouring in, I’ve got nowhere to be, and I can feel a little smile creeping up every time I take a sip. It’s a different kind of bliss—human bliss. Simple. No drama, no beastly instincts. Just me, my coffee, and a day to take slow.

Funny how life can feel like two different worlds, but right now, I wouldn’t change a thing.

1gce8kd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskLGBT/comments/1gce8kd/how_do_you_deal_with_straight_bait_dudes/,how do you deal with straight bait dudes? ,"I really don’t want this to come off weird but I was just thinking about how many times I’ve been made to feel super insecure and confused by some straight men in my past. (Skip to last paragraph for the short version lol)

One of my longest male friend relationships I decided to end because I felt like for years they wanted more but were too afraid to bring it up— I was afraid to speak up on my suspicions for literally years! When I finally found the courage he was kind but I felt so gaslit by him. It’s was small things that could easily be denied that made me feel deceived— he would offer me his jacket if I was shivering or his feet and body always faced me and he was always in close proximity to me in a group setting even when his girlfriend was included in that group, he never treated me like any of our other long term friends in our group. After all the years I had to cut ties because at that point I no longer could see him as anything less than a boyfriend— this really broke my heart honestly. 

 I’ve also had many male friendships where this line never felt blurred and we each knew exactly where we stand— this is the norm. The guys I’m talking about are the type of guys that are mean to their girlfriends and always want you around. They treat you like more than a friend but are subtle enough to conceal their intentions if they are confronted or just straight up cross a line and act like nothing happened. As a young person I constantly gave the benefit of the doubt to the men I was weary of— I’m pretty sure that maybe they are bi-curious or something but I really want to avoid these types of situations for the future as they are humiliating and awkward. 

The reason this is on my mind lately is because I’m recognizing this pattern from a friend in a new group that I’m hanging out with. For context, at a small gathering at their apartment they were djaying. He invited me to try it out so I went and sat next to him on the sofa where he had his set up on the coffee table.  It was fun but after a bit he took over again resting his forearms on my lap, he proceeded to do this for quite a while maybe 10-15 minutes but it felt like an eternity and it just kind of made me freeze up— he was baring his weight on me a bit so moving would have been awkward and it was when I finally worked up the courage to say I need the restroom lol. With this instance, past interactions with him make me question his motives like compliments on my physical appearance. I tried confiding in a close friend who also knows him and she told me there was no way he was into me and that all her gay friends think that about him… not sure how the last bit of information helps her case but I just don’t want a repeat of the past. Long story short at what point is it acceptable to confront someone about this stuff or do I just have to be strategic to not end up on a sofa near him again— I do enjoy this group of people as a whole and just want to proceed tactfully and consider the politics of the group. He has a girlfriend and I hate the awkward feeling— it’s probably worth mentioning that he doesn’t behave this way when she’s around. Probably should have prefaced this with saying I am on the spectrum and I just really struggle navigating this stuff. 

I just know I’m not alone on this and would love to hear your stories and feedback if you have some to share. Thanks :)",1,1729921291.0,AskLGBT,0,1.0,False

1gce2cz,https://www.reddit.com/r/HysteriaTV/comments/1gce2cz/i_wanted_to_like_this_show_a_lot_more/,I wanted to like this show a lot more,"I'm an 80's kid, I love *Stranger Things*, I love Bruce Campbell, and I think there are some really good elements here...but in the end I feel like the show needed to pick a lane and it didn't. Either this is an accidental murder cover-up that turned into mob mentality and got out of hand (which is the story the show tells best IMO); OR it's a supernatural thriller and the devil made them do it. I'm reminded of Mr. Miyagi, ""Walk right side, ok. Walk left side, ok. Walk midde? Squish like grape.""

I think the show left threads dangling either because they didn't want to be compared to *Stranger Things* as an 80's nostalgia piece with supernatural elements, or because they want a second season to answer those questions. But really, if you take out all the devil stuff, I think you tell a much better story. Before I get too deep into my criticism, Anna Camp is fantastic, and she almost save this show from its sins in character and out. Bruce Campbell gives you what you expect from Bruce Campbell. Garret Dillahunt is great as the sinister preacher with the checkered past. But ultimately the show leaves dangling threads that I feel like it didn't earn and I don't care if they get answered:

What was possessing Linda? She had the rash, and something threw her through the coffee table and broke the mirror in the bar. Something had its clutches into her in the last episode, but we never find out what.

Dylan being the product of Linda ""calling out to the void"" had potential, but I feel like the writers either forgot about it, or didn't want to turn him into this show's 11. 

What was giving people the rash?

What caused the earthquake?

What caused the red lights?

Was Tracy possessed by whatever was tormenting Hawki...er...Happy Hollow all along and secretly working for it? A better show would have done that and used her as the villain for a second season by setting that up in a satisfying way. As it is I feel like the show told one good story, Ryan's murder and the coverup/unravelling, and it tried to jam some stuff in to try and get a second season pickup that I personally don't care if it gets, and likely won't watch if it does. 

There's nothing wrong with ripping off a successful IP. Happens all the time. So if you're going to rip off *Stranger Things*, swing for the fences and rip off *Stranger Things.* Have the ""devil"" be behind it and make it about defeating his agents here on Earth until you can ultimately confront him. If the only real story you have is the one season murder mystery coverup, lean into that. Tell that story to the fullest, and get out on a good note. 

I feel like a really good idea got some (really not much stranger) things thrown into it that bogged it down and would have been best left out entirely.",1,1729920569.0,HysteriaTV,1,1.0,False
1gce1gd,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1gce1gd/hr_night_lights/,[HR] Night Lights,"Cough, cough, cough! My chest tightens as I fight to catch my breath. Mornings are always the worst. None of us breathe easy in this city—the smog ensures that. At least they say it’ll improve in a few decades. I force myself out of bed, muttering, “If I can make it to work on time, I might help with that.”
 
I rush through my routine: teeth, shower, inhaler, and a nutri-bar for breakfast. On the way to the trolley, I grab a newspaper, and coffee. “New Krystal Tech Lighting Installation Nears Completion,” the headline reads. That’s where I’m headed—part of the crew retrofitting the lighting grid. It’s supposed to be our salvation, though I can’t say I fully understand it.
 
Researchers found these crystals in the wastelands. What’s left of the world outside the city is soaked in radiation, but these crystals don’t emit any. Somehow, they convert radiation into energy and store it like a battery. The scientists think it’s Earth’s way of fighting back after we nearly wiped ourselves out in the Last War.
 
“Next stop, City Center,” the trolley voice announces, snapping me back to the present. I scan my badge at the entrance to the City Infrastructure Operations Center—Ci-Op, as we call it.
 
“Hey, Sam! Wait up!” I hear a familiar voice behind me and turn to see Bobbie hurrying to catch up. Bobbie’s a coworker and friend. Though we’re on different crews, we are both Public Utility Engineers.
 
“Did you hear?” Bobbie asks, falling in step beside me. “They’re saying if we want to finish on time, we’re going to have to work mandatory overtime all week—thirteen-hour days. Are they trying to save us or kill us!”
 
“Well, at least the pay’s going to be good,” I reply. “And the sooner we finish, the sooner the lights can start filtering the smog.”
 
Bobbie nods. “I overheard some of the higher-ups talking. They think that with the energy we’ll save with these crystals, the city may be able to cut back on energy production, which means even less of this insufferable smog.”
 
“See? This little bit of overtime will be worth it, then, right?”
 
“Yeah, I hear ya,” says Bobbie, laughing. “But I’m sleeping for a week when it’s done.”
 
We both chuckle as we part ways. “See you at the Den later!” Bobbie calls back with a wave.
 
I don’t need to check the assignments; my crew is on the northeast quadrant, sectors 7-10 for the rest of the week. I’m the first one at the garage, so I start loading the work truck with our gear. Only small electric kei trucks and similar work vehicles are allowed on the streets. Vehicles create too much pollution. Soon, the crew arrives.
 
We work in teams of three., my team is Drew—quiet and scrawny but a good worker—and Riley, a bit older than me, who brings a touch more wisdom.
 
Once at the job site, we go streetlight by streetlight, removing the old ones and running new wires. We set up new posts and finally instal the lights to ensure they work. We have a small power pad to just briefly test the lights to ensure they work. After all, it’s an energy source, and we’re all well-versed in conserving energy.
 
We won’t know for sure if it even works until a week from now. The crystals have only been used in small experiments and tests; it’s a gamble, but a necessary one. It’s not good for the public to know that we’re so desperate though. Not that they don’t feel it with every breath.
 
Suddenly, a high-pitched shriek pierces the air, pulling me from my thoughts. “What in the heck was that?” I ask, slightly embarrassed that I had zoned out.
 
Drew and Riley looked just as confused as I was. There was no one on-site, and I could have sworn the scream came from just over my shoulder. “ “No idea, boss,” Drew says with an unsteady voice before grabbing their inhaler. “ “Sounded like it came from the light to me,”  said Riley. I turn the light back on. Nothing. Unable to explain it, we carried on with our work.
 
Once the day was over and we were back at Ci-Op, I decided to let my supervisor know what had happened. If someone had been there and screamed, maybe they still needed help. I couldn’t shake the sound from my mind.
 
When I told Alex about it, they said, “This isn’t the first report I’ve received. It’s just a rare byproduct of the energy released by the crystals, and it is nothing you should fret over.”
 
With my mind at ease, I scanned my badge to leave and head to the den. After stressing over what turned out to be nothing, I could use a drink—or maybe five.
 
As I walked into the den, I was greeted by my friends sitting in our usual corner booth. The den is a bar close by that we all go to most days after work. It’s a dimly lit blue-collar establishment, but the beers are cheap, and the company is as good as any. 
 
“Hey, pals!” I say as I slide into the booth.
 
Bobbie grins. “It’s about time!”
 
“Jordan and Dakota here were starting to get worried,” they chime in, elbowing Dakota in jest.
 
Dakota, pint in hand, throws it back, burps loudly, and wipes their mouth. “The only thing I’m worried about after a thirteen-hour shift is my beer and my back. Ahhh, it’s killing me.”
 
“Here, stand up,” Jordan says, pulling Dakota to their feet. They wrap their arms around Dakota, lifting them effortlessly and popping their back with an audible crack like firecrackers. Dakota lets out a wail, either in pleasure,  agony, or both.
 
“Ohh. Ahh. That hurt so good, thanks, pal,” Dakota says excitedly, rubbing their back. “Since I’m up, I’m getting another round. Are y’all good?”
 
“I’ll take one!” I reply.
 
Jordan downs the glass in front of them and says, “Me too,” as the glass hits the table.
 
“I’m good,” Bobbie says, as Dakota walks away. “Have you guys heard anything about the lights making noise because of some energy release or something?”
 
“Ehh, only from rumors,” Bobbie replies. “I heard it once last week, but it came from a crew a couple of streets over. I thought someone was being killed; it freaked me out. But my mate on that crew told me later it came from the light. They thought they’d messed something up, but were told it was just a byproduct of the new system, yada, yada.”
 
“Well, it happened to a light I was testing today, and it’s much more chilling in person. I swear it sounded just like someone screaming in agony, right over my shoulder, almost in my ear.”
 
“Are you talking about the crystal shrieks?” Dakota asks, setting down three fresh drinks. “That’s nothing. A buddy of mine on Beta said they saw something in the light for a brief second when it was on. Just a figure—little more than a shadow. But as soon as the light went out, so did the shadow.”
 
“Now that just sounds like they need their head examined. Because that’s just how lights work,” Bobbie scoffs.
 
We all laugh, and as my beer hits my hand, I forget all about work and the horrible screaming.
 
When I get home, I turn on the radio. The news is playing, so I leave it on. Of course, they’re talking about the crystals. Telling projected stats about how when we flip the switch on this project, the crystal light purification will begin filtering the smog at a rate that will make the air completely non-toxic in only a hundred and fifty years. They say we should see signs of its effects within five years.
 
The news droned on as I got ready for bed, and I was deep asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow.
 
The next few days blurred together in a haze of long hours, drinks, and sleep. With the workload weighing on me, it was all I could manage. As far as I was concerned, the screaming was the farthest thing from my mind. By the last day, all I could think about was breathing easy once this was all over—both figuratively and, hopefully, literally.
 
Finally, a week had passed, and I was testing the last lamppost in our section. I called it a day, feeling a wave of relief. Tonight would mark the first night of our future and the start of our four-day weekend as a reward for all our hard work. I scanned my badge, clocked out for the day, and headed to the Den.
 
It was a nice day by smog-covered city standards. The sun seemed to cut through the haze more than usual, making everything feel warmer and brighter. A sign of good fortune, I hoped. It would still be hours before they officially turned on the lights, and I felt a rush of excitement as I walked in. The Den was alive with happy, celebrating cheers..
 
I paused for a moment to take it all in. They were all smiling—a rare sight in this city. For the first time in a long while, we had hope, and I wanted to remember this moment. I grabbed four pints before joining them.
 
“A round for us?” Jordan said as I set the glasses on the table.
 
“What, this? That’s all for me,” I quipped back, wrapping my arm around them in mock possessiveness.
 
“And here I was about to sing your praises, just to find out you’re a tease and a glutton,” Jordan replied, clutching my pearls in jest. We all laughed as I distributed the beer to my friends, sliding into the booth next to Bobbie and taking a hearty gulp from half my pint. Maybe I really should have gotten four, I thought, eyeing my now half-empty glass.
 
“Are the rest of you planning to sleep through your days off like Bobbie here?” I asked.
 
“I’ll be out like Sleeping Beauty,” Bobbie said, pretending to snore.
 
“Eh, you know I can’t sit still that long,” Jordan chimed in. “Besides, I’ve got plenty to catch up on at home. With these crazy hours, I’ve barely felt like taking out the trash this week.”
 
Dakota took a puff from their inhaler, inhaling deeply, then exhaling with a series of coughs. “I’ll be down for some rest for my back, but I can’t say I want to sleep it all away. I heard the city is supposed to throw a small festival tomorrow to celebrate this step toward a better future.”
 
“Really?” I replied. “That sounds like it could be fun. We should all go together. Come on, Bobbie, oh pal! Won’t you wake up to go to a festival with me?” I teased, nudging them with my shoulder.
 
“Fine,” they said, drawing out the word in fake exasperation. “Just for you.”
 
“Awe, you’ll give up sleep for me? You do care,” I teased, and the table erupted in laughter.
 
I downed the last half of my glass. “Now let’s celebrate!”
 
“More drinks coming up!” Dakota said, standing to grab the next round.
 
As we said our goodbyes outside the Den, I questioned my decision to drink so much. It wasn’t a terrible walk home, but the trolley had stopped running., So now I had no choice. The three blocks that would’ve felt like nothing when sober now felt overwhelming as I stumbled through the streets. Even still, I found myself humming along to one of my favorite songs playing on a loop in my head. There were just too many good things happening at the moment, and despite feeling dizzy…oh,  woo, I feel dizzy.
 
I leaned against the wall to steady myself. Blarg… I vomited all over the wall and sidewalk. It took a few moments of both puking and dry heaving for my stomach to settle. I stayed leaned against the wall, as I puffed on my inhaler grateful that my building was just ahead—maybe fifty feet away. At least throwing up had sobered me up just slightly.
 
Suddenly a high-pitched scream penetrated the fog in my mind. I jumped and turned too fast, nearly falling over in fright. It was that noise again, haunting and chilling to the bone. It was longer this time, but the lights were really on now. I took a deep breath, rationalizing the noise, and steadied myself to head home.
 
Shakily, I stood and walked to my apartment. As I passed the last lamppost at the door to my building, I paused. I felt like someone was standing right behind me. I looked down, and beside my shadow was another shadow—larger and misshapen. Fear surged through me as I jerked my head around, but there was nothing there. I sighed in relief, convincing myself I must just be seeing double. I laughed it off and went inside.
 
I barely made it to the bathroom before I started puking again, hugging the toilet until it was over. After rinsing my mouth with mouthwash, I poured myself a glass of water. As I sipped the water, I decided to look out the window at the lights we worked so hard on and put so much hope in!
 
As I stared at the soft white glow emitted by the crystals through the haze of smog, it appeared as if someone was standing in the middle of the lamp’s glow. I squinted, trying to get a closer look, and as my breath fogged up the window, It caught in shock. The figure I was looking at had no skin, just muscle and ligaments, wet and glistening. Just as I realized what I was seeing, a high-pitched scream filled the night.
 
I dropped my glass in terror, the scream turning my blood to ice. I glanced at the broken glass and back up to the street. Nothing was there. I rubbed my eyes and looked again—still nothing.
 
“Okay, Sam, you’re super tired and more than a little drunk. You must be hallucinating. Yeah, that’s it. I’m just seeing things.” I cleaned up the water and glass, then, with one last glance at the empty street, lay down, my consciousness slipping away into sleep.
 
 I wake up coughing, immediately reaching for my inhaler. My throat sore from last night’s retching. After a moment, I catch my breath and get up to grab a glass of water, only to realize my bladder needs more urgent attention. As I relieve myself, I notice the mouthwash from last night didn’t fully do the trick. I take care of that too, brushing my teeth again.
 
I jump into the shower, cranking the heat as high as I can stand. The steam helps loosen up my lungs, and I start coughing up black, mucousy bits.. Afterward, I hit my inhaler again before finally pouring that glass of water. It feels soothing on my dry throat.
 
“Okay, now something for my head,” I mutter, grabbing a bottle of aspirin. I throw back two pills with the rest of my water, then find something comfortable but still somewhat fashionable to wear to the festival. I feel like I’ve been hit by a truck. “I can’t handle hangovers like I used to,” I say with a sigh as I head out the door. Despite the exhaustion, excitement is building.
 
When I get to the Den, I’m the first of my friends to arrive. A server comes over as I sit down.
 
“I don’t usually see you here this early, Sam,” says Casey.
 
“Yeah, we decided we’d check out the festival together. I’m just waiting on the rest,” I reply.
 
“Anything I can get you while you wait?”
 
“Some coffee, for sure. And maybe a couple of eggs with toast. I need something to settle my stomach.”
 
I tap my toes to the music as I wait. Jordan shows up next, followed by Dakota and our food. Bobbie still hasn’t arrived By the time we finish eating.
 
“I guess Bobbie’s sleeping in after all,” Dakota says.
 
“So much for really loving me,” I quip with a laugh.
 
Jordan, starting to get fidgety, suggests, “Why don’t we go ahead and check out the festival? We can come back in an hour to see if Bobbie’s here by then.”
 
“Alright,” I agree. “Let me just ask Casey to tell Bobbie the plan if they show up.”
 
The festival took up an entire block of Main Street downtown, with food vendors, game stalls, and colorful decorations everywhere. Crowds had already started forming, the excitement buzzing in the air like static. The smell of fried treats filled my nose, reigniting my appetite. Over the roar of the festival-goers, I could faintly hear music.
 
“You hear that?” I ask, leading my friends toward the sound. “I think a band’s playing. Let’s check it out.”
 
We join the crowd in front of the stage just as the band finishes a song. It’s a group of four musicians with a grungy, rock aesthetic, playing covers of popular songs. As they launch into the next song, I’m surprised to hear my favorite. I can’t help but jump up and down with the crowd, singing along with the lyrics.
 
We stay and listen for a while, caught up in the energy until Dakota reminds us of the time. Reluctantly, we head back to the Den to see if Bobbie’s finally woken up.
 
“Hey Casey,” I say as we walk in from the street. “Has Bobbie shown up yet?”
 
Casey shakes their head. “No, I still haven’t seen them.”
 
“Well, their loss,” I say, shrugging. “Why don’t we grab a drink here where it’s cheaper? If Bobbie doesn’t show by the time we’re done, we’ll have Casey tell them to meet us at the stage. The festival’s not huge; we’ll find each other if they show.”
 
As we settle in with our drinks, I overhear a conversation on the news playing across the bar.
 
“With the start of the Crystal Initiative today, some residents have reported a bizarre screaming noise coming from the new lights,” the anchor says.
 
“That’s right,” a second voice chimes in, “but not to worry. Experts are advising this is a completely natural byproduct of the new system, and they’re hard at work to fix it.”
 
The first voice returns, sounding more upbeat. “Remember, this is just a temporary problem for a long-term solution, folks. The noise is just that—noise.”
 
I turn my attention back to my friends, who are deep in a debate about how easy the milk bottle game looks. The objective was simple: toss a ball at a stack of milk bottles and knock them down.
 
“I could knock ’em down in one throw,” Jordan says confidently.
 
“I don’t know,” Dakota interjects. “Everyone I saw was having a pretty hard time with it.”
 
“Yeah, but they’re not me,” Jordan retorts with a grin.
 
“And what makes you more qualified than them to knock down bottles?” I ask, finishing my beer. “You got some secret hobby we don’t know about?”
 
Jordan shrugs. “Well, no… but I’m naturally athletic. It’s in the genes, Sam..”
 
“Uh-huh,” I laugh. “Well, looks like Bobbie’s gonna miss all the fun. Let’s go so you can show us just how naturally athletic you are.”
 
“Thanks, Casey!” I shout on our way out the door. “You know where we’ll be if Bobbie ever shows up.”
 
On the way to the game, I couldn’t resist stopping at a few food stalls. I grab some kabobs, a taco, a soft pretzel, and some fried Oreos. I share my spoils with my friends, knowing I won’t be able to finish it all but wanting to try everything.
 
It took Jordan five tries to finally knock all the bottles down. Dakota, on the other hand, had a muscle spasm in their back mid-throw, and accidentally knocked them all down on their first try.
 
We played a few more games, then decided to grab some drinks and listen to the new band on stage. They had more of a folk vibe, playing mellow music that set a peaceful mood, with a calm joy emanating from both the speakers and the crowd.
 
Next, the mayor stepped onto the stage.
 
“First, I’d like to thank everyone for coming out today to celebrate the beginning of the Crystal Initiative,” he began, his voice carrying across the square. “As you all know, since the destruction caused by the Last War, the world outside this city has been uninhabitable, consumed by radiation. And as a byproduct of our survival, our city has been blanketed in smog, causing health and safety concerns for us all.” He paused, punctuating his statement with a cough.
 
“But today,” the mayor continued, his voice rising with hope, “these crystal lighting filtration systems will help clear the smog and light our way to a brighter, cleaner future!”
 
Applause erupted from the crowd, but it was cut short by a chilling, high-pitched scream.
 
“Heeeeeeeeeelp!”
 
The sound pierced the air, causing some people to cover their ears and others to clutch their children in fear. It was long, loud, and seemed to come from every direction at once. It wasn’t just a scream—it was the sound of someone pleading for help, raw and agonized as if nothing but pain and despair could escape their throat.
 
I froze, my mind spiraling into a dark place. But the mayor’s voice brought me back.
 
“Don’t worry!” he called out, trying to regain control. “Our scientists and engineers will have that fixed before you know it. The cleaner air we’re already starting to enjoy will be well worth these minor disruptions. Once again, thank you all for coming out tonight. Have safe travels home.” 
 
The crowd clapped hesitantly as the mayor left the stage, and I realized how late it had gotten.
 
“I’m going to stop by Bobbie’s place on my way home,” I said. “They said they would come, and despite being tired, that’s just not like them. It may just be that scream, but I feel like something is wrong.” “
 
I still have chills from it,” said Dakota.
 
“I’m sure it’s just the noise and your imagination,” Jordan remarked with a wave. “Later.”
 
When I got to Bobbie’s apartment, there was no answer, so I used the key under the mat to go in and check if everything was okay. I looked all over the small apartment, but Bobbie was nowhere to be found.
 
“This isn’t like them to just disappear and not show up.” My concern turned to worry as I locked up. “Nothing I can do at the moment,” I said to myself, deciding to head home.
 
I couldn’t stop thinking about what could’ve happened to Bobbie. Were they sick? Did they go to the hospital? Was there an accident? Anything that could go wrong had already played out in my mind.
 
The icy chill in the wind was a stark contrast to yesterday’s warmth. As I neared my building, I saw a figure standing in the same spot as last night, bringing back memories of my hallucinations. I slowed my pace, approaching with hesitance. I saw the same thing as before, but now with more detail. My mind struggled to comprehend it, fear and confusion filling my brain.
 
It was as if two bodies had been fused at the back, an amalgamation of arms and legs with two heads. What I thought were muscles last night now looked like badly burned flesh, almost melting off the bones. I froze, fear gluing me to the spot. I didn’t want to look, but I couldn’t pull my eyes away. It wasn’t just standing there — it was writhing in pain. It looked like it was trying to scream, and though I was terrified, part of me felt heartbroken, still not understanding what I was seeing.
 
I started to slowly move closer, curiosity battling my fear. The creature didn’t react, so I got even closer. As I did, I noticed I could almost see through it, like it was ethereal or some kind of projection — as if it wasn’t there. I stepped into the light, feeling more confident it was just an illusion.
 
But when I reached out to wave my hand through it, the creature turned both of its heads toward me and grabbed my forearm. I heard it scream, “Help me.” It was the same scream I’d been hearing, but this time I heard it clearly — an agonizing cry for help. My forearm burned with a cold, unlike anything I’d ever felt, searing my skin. My heartbeat pounded in my ears as chills ran through my body. I felt faint, and the world went black.
 
I awoke instantly, terrified, shuffling out of the light. There was nothing there. My arm throbbed with pain. I looked down, clutching it with my other hand. A handprint—burned into my skin—marked my forearm like I’d been branded. Panic surged through me.
 
Standing up, I held my burning arm tight against my chest and ran. Faster than I had in years. I sprinted straight to my apartment. It wasn’t far, but by the time I reached my building, I was already gasping for air. I frantically searched my pockets for my inhaler, the pain, confusion, and panic making it hard to focus. As I reached the stairs, my fingers finally closed around the familiar shape of it.
 
Wheezing and coughing, I inhaled a puff as I raced down the hall. Once inside, with the door locked behind me, I collapsed onto the floor, taking another hit from the inhaler. My body heaved as I coughed, black mucus splattering the floor. It took a long time before I could breathe again, my lungs still burning. But at least now, I could tend to my arm.
 
I immediately ran cool water over my arm, feeling temporary relief as the burn’s pain dulled. With my free hand, I reached under the sink for the first aid kit. I rummaged through it, trying to keep the burn under the water. I found the burn cream and gauze, fumbling to bandage my arm.
 
Once wrapped, I took some aspirin, then collapsed into bed, pulling the covers tightly around me. My heart still pounded in my chest. What the hell just happened? I thought to myself, staring into the dark.
 
What was that? Is that what happened to Bobbie? What do I do—what can I do? Are they coming from the crystals? Or maybe the crystals are attracting them? This is crazy. If it weren’t for the pain in my arm, I’d think I was losing it, but this is all too real.
 
Help me—
 
Another scream slices through the night. I shiver, pulling the covers tighter around me. My arm reignites with pain as fear tightens in my chest.
 
The screams keep coming, louder, longer, more frequent. Each time, the plea for help gets clearer, sinking into me. I can’t tell where it’s coming from—it’s everywhere like it’s surrounding me, crawling into my mind. I thought they’d stop at dawn, but when I looked out the window, the lights were still on, and more of those things were flickering in and out of the streetlights.
 
What is this? Why is this happening?
 
Maybe there’s something on the news. I fumble for the radio, flipping it on.
 
Beeeeeeeeep, beeeeeeeep, beeeeeeeep. This is not a test. This is an emergency broadcast. We urge all residents to remain in their homes. Do not enter the streets, and stay away from direct crystal lighting. We are working toward a solution. Please stay tuned for updates. Beeeeeeeep,
 
I turn the dial. It’s the same on every station.
 
I sink back into my chair, staring out the window. More questions, no answers. “They’re working on it,” I whisper to myself. “Everything will be okay.” But why haven’t they turned the lights off?
 
My arm throbs again, so I clean and re-dress the burn, trying to keep myself busy. I make some coffee, forcing myself through breakfast. The screams keep breaking the silence every few minutes, and I watch the creatures flicker in and out of the light, their forms twisting in ways that make me feel sick.
 
By mid-afternoon, the screams come every fifteen minutes. The creatures aren’t flickering anymore. There are more of them now, all solid. They move freely through the light, their motions jerky and erratic. Some claw at their faces, others wave their hands in confusion. Some look humans shaped, but others—blobs of flesh, piles of melted bodies, grotesque forms that make my stomach churn. Slimy, like exposed tissue. I can’t take my eyes off them, but I wish I could.
 
I hear the radio crackle, shifting from the endless loop to a live broadcast. My heart leaps as I scramble to turn up the volume.
 
“I wish I was coming to you with better news,” the mayor’s voice began, strained and weary. “But the reality is, we have no more answers now than we did this morning. All attempts to shut off the crystals have resulted in fatalities. Worse, the continued light from them seems to be making the situation worse, but we don’t yet know why. We have people working around the clock for a solution, but what was once seen as our salvation has quickly become a nightmare.”
 
He paused, and my stomach dropped. “We urge you to stay inside, away from these creatures. They are dangerous. Please, stay safe, citizens.”
 
The transmission cut off, replaced by the same emergency loop, but the mayor’s words echoed in my mind. Fatalities. They’ve lost control. If that’s what they’re telling the public, it’s already worse than they’ll admit. They never tell us how bad things are—not until it’s too late.
 
Despair washed over me. I crawled into bed, pulled the covers over my head, and let the tears fall.
 
I woke up hours later. By this time, there was no break from the screams—a constant cacophony of overlapping cries for help. As I looked outside, the streets were covered in gruesome, mutilated bodies. They weren’t just in the light anymore; those with legs and the ability to move were walking and running around aimlessly as more and more appeared in the lights. I choked back a sob as hopelessness set in. I pulled my burning arm to my chest, terrified of what they would do to me.
 
I went to the radio, doubting I’d hear anything new and not daring to hope. I turned the knob; it was just the beeping. I sighed and was about to turn it off when a voice came on.
 
“Can you hear me? I don’t know why I’m asking; you can’t respond. Heck, I don’t even know if anyone is still out there. As you know by now, these monsters are overrunning the city. Anyone who comes into contact with them dies, consumed by burning pain until they ultimately succumb. I guess now I’m just wasting time, waiting for my death.”
 
“Oh no,” I whispered, watching as the door to my building collapsed from the force of one of them ramming into it. That meant they were now in my building. I panicked, shoving my bed and furniture in front of the door.
 
The voice continued, “I’ve been a part of this project from the start, and I have some theories about what’s going on—but that’s all they’ll ever be: theories.”
 
I told myself I’d be fine—I was on the second floor. I watched as more and more of them found their way inside off the street. Grabbing my inhaler, I struggled to breathe, panic tightening my chest. I tried to focus on the voice coming from the radio.
 
“I believe everyone who died as the nukes went off in the Last War was somehow trapped in that moment—the moment of their death, in agony. They somehow became the radiation.”
 
I heard shuffling in the hallway outside my door. “How…how did they get up here so fast?” My breathing grew worse, and my arm was burning more fiercely. All rationality was gone at this point, and I had no idea what to do. Frantically, I paced my small apartment. I was scared; I didn’t want to die. I didn’t want to hurt. Tears were streaming down my face.
 
The voice continued, “When these crystals formed, they absorbed the radiation—or rather, the haunted souls. And somehow, when we started converting that energy, we released these agonizing souls back into the world.”
 
They were banging and clawing at my door. Light seeped through the cracks as it began to break. I crouched in the corner farthest from the door, wrapped in my blanket, crying and listening to the last voice I would probably ever hear.
 
Is this what happened to Bobbie? Are the rest of my friends still alive? Are they trapped and terrified like I am?
 
The voice on the radio cleared his throat. “Ah…I hear them. They’re getting closer. I’ll probably be going soon. It seems the sins of the past are catching up to us.”
 
They were through my door now, in my apartment. I couldn’t help but wonder, now in the end, after everything we’ve done, if humanity ever deserved to exist at all. As their hands closed around me, burning, I screamed, “Help me!”—fading into the endless chorus of screams.
 
The End.",1,1729920466.0,shortstories,1,0.99,False
1gce0rk,https://www.reddit.com/r/scaryshortstories/comments/1gce0rk/night_lights/,Night Lights,"Cough, cough, cough! My chest tightens as I fight to catch my breath. Mornings are always the worst. None of us breathe easy in this city—the smog ensures that. At least they say it’ll improve in a few decades. I force myself out of bed, muttering, “If I can make it to work on time, I might help with that.”
 
I rush through my routine: teeth, shower, inhaler, and a nutri-bar for breakfast. On the way to the trolley, I grab a newspaper, and coffee. “New Krystal Tech Lighting Installation Nears Completion,” the headline reads. That’s where I’m headed—part of the crew retrofitting the lighting grid. It’s supposed to be our salvation, though I can’t say I fully understand it.
 
Researchers found these crystals in the wastelands. What’s left of the world outside the city is soaked in radiation, but these crystals don’t emit any. Somehow, they convert radiation into energy and store it like a battery. The scientists think it’s Earth’s way of fighting back after we nearly wiped ourselves out in the Last War.
 
“Next stop, City Center,” the trolley voice announces, snapping me back to the present. I scan my badge at the entrance to the City Infrastructure Operations Center—Ci-Op, as we call it.
 
“Hey, Sam! Wait up!” I hear a familiar voice behind me and turn to see Bobbie hurrying to catch up. Bobbie’s a coworker and friend. Though we’re on different crews, we are both Public Utility Engineers.
 
“Did you hear?” Bobbie asks, falling in step beside me. “They’re saying if we want to finish on time, we’re going to have to work mandatory overtime all week—thirteen-hour days. Are they trying to save us or kill us!”
 
“Well, at least the pay’s going to be good,” I reply. “And the sooner we finish, the sooner the lights can start filtering the smog.”
 
Bobbie nods. “I overheard some of the higher-ups talking. They think that with the energy we’ll save with these crystals, the city may be able to cut back on energy production, which means even less of this insufferable smog.”
 
“See? This little bit of overtime will be worth it, then, right?”
 
“Yeah, I hear ya,” says Bobbie, laughing. “But I’m sleeping for a week when it’s done.”
 
We both chuckle as we part ways. “See you at the Den later!” Bobbie calls back with a wave.
 
I don’t need to check the assignments; my crew is on the northeast quadrant, sectors 7-10 for the rest of the week. I’m the first one at the garage, so I start loading the work truck with our gear. Only small electric kei trucks and similar work vehicles are allowed on the streets. Vehicles create too much pollution. Soon, the crew arrives.
 
We work in teams of three., my team is Drew—quiet and scrawny but a good worker—and Riley, a bit older than me, who brings a touch more wisdom.
 
Once at the job site, we go streetlight by streetlight, removing the old ones and running new wires. We set up new posts and finally instal the lights to ensure they work. We have a small power pad to just briefly test the lights to ensure they work. After all, it’s an energy source, and we’re all well-versed in conserving energy.
 
We won’t know for sure if it even works until a week from now. The crystals have only been used in small experiments and tests; it’s a gamble, but a necessary one. It’s not good for the public to know that we’re so desperate though. Not that they don’t feel it with every breath.
 
Suddenly, a high-pitched shriek pierces the air, pulling me from my thoughts. “What in the heck was that?” I ask, slightly embarrassed that I had zoned out.
 
Drew and Riley looked just as confused as I was. There was no one on-site, and I could have sworn the scream came from just over my shoulder. “ “No idea, boss,” Drew says with an unsteady voice before grabbing their inhaler. “ “Sounded like it came from the light to me,”  said Riley. I turn the light back on. Nothing. Unable to explain it, we carried on with our work.
 
Once the day was over and we were back at Ci-Op, I decided to let my supervisor know what had happened. If someone had been there and screamed, maybe they still needed help. I couldn’t shake the sound from my mind.
 
When I told Alex about it, they said, “This isn’t the first report I’ve received. It’s just a rare byproduct of the energy released by the crystals, and it is nothing you should fret over.”
 
With my mind at ease, I scanned my badge to leave and head to the den. After stressing over what turned out to be nothing, I could use a drink—or maybe five.
 
As I walked into the den, I was greeted by my friends sitting in our usual corner booth. The den is a bar close by that we all go to most days after work. It’s a dimly lit blue-collar establishment, but the beers are cheap, and the company is as good as any. 
 
“Hey, pals!” I say as I slide into the booth.
 
Bobbie grins. “It’s about time!”
 
“Jordan and Dakota here were starting to get worried,” they chime in, elbowing Dakota in jest.
 
Dakota, pint in hand, throws it back, burps loudly, and wipes their mouth. “The only thing I’m worried about after a thirteen-hour shift is my beer and my back. Ahhh, it’s killing me.”
 
“Here, stand up,” Jordan says, pulling Dakota to their feet. They wrap their arms around Dakota, lifting them effortlessly and popping their back with an audible crack like firecrackers. Dakota lets out a wail, either in pleasure,  agony, or both.
 
“Ohh. Ahh. That hurt so good, thanks, pal,” Dakota says excitedly, rubbing their back. “Since I’m up, I’m getting another round. Are y’all good?”
 
“I’ll take one!” I reply.
 
Jordan downs the glass in front of them and says, “Me too,” as the glass hits the table.
 
“I’m good,” Bobbie says, as Dakota walks away. “Have you guys heard anything about the lights making noise because of some energy release or something?”
 
“Ehh, only from rumors,” Bobbie replies. “I heard it once last week, but it came from a crew a couple of streets over. I thought someone was being killed; it freaked me out. But my mate on that crew told me later it came from the light. They thought they’d messed something up, but were told it was just a byproduct of the new system, yada, yada.”
 
“Well, it happened to a light I was testing today, and it’s much more chilling in person. I swear it sounded just like someone screaming in agony, right over my shoulder, almost in my ear.”
 
“Are you talking about the crystal shrieks?” Dakota asks, setting down three fresh drinks. “That’s nothing. A buddy of mine on Beta said they saw something in the light for a brief second when it was on. Just a figure—little more than a shadow. But as soon as the light went out, so did the shadow.”
 
“Now that just sounds like they need their head examined. Because that’s just how lights work,” Bobbie scoffs.
 
We all laugh, and as my beer hits my hand, I forget all about work and the horrible screaming.
 
When I get home, I turn on the radio. The news is playing, so I leave it on. Of course, they’re talking about the crystals. Telling projected stats about how when we flip the switch on this project, the crystal light purification will begin filtering the smog at a rate that will make the air completely non-toxic in only a hundred and fifty years. They say we should see signs of its effects within five years.
 
The news droned on as I got ready for bed, and I was deep asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow.
 
The next few days blurred together in a haze of long hours, drinks, and sleep. With the workload weighing on me, it was all I could manage. As far as I was concerned, the screaming was the farthest thing from my mind. By the last day, all I could think about was breathing easy once this was all over—both figuratively and, hopefully, literally.
 
Finally, a week had passed, and I was testing the last lamppost in our section. I called it a day, feeling a wave of relief. Tonight would mark the first night of our future and the start of our four-day weekend as a reward for all our hard work. I scanned my badge, clocked out for the day, and headed to the Den.
 
It was a nice day by smog-covered city standards. The sun seemed to cut through the haze more than usual, making everything feel warmer and brighter. A sign of good fortune, I hoped. It would still be hours before they officially turned on the lights, and I felt a rush of excitement as I walked in. The Den was alive with happy, celebrating cheers..
 
I paused for a moment to take it all in. They were all smiling—a rare sight in this city. For the first time in a long while, we had hope, and I wanted to remember this moment. I grabbed four pints before joining them.
 
“A round for us?” Jordan said as I set the glasses on the table.
 
“What, this? That’s all for me,” I quipped back, wrapping my arm around them in mock possessiveness.
 
“And here I was about to sing your praises, just to find out you’re a tease and a glutton,” Jordan replied, clutching my pearls in jest. We all laughed as I distributed the beer to my friends, sliding into the booth next to Bobbie and taking a hearty gulp from half my pint. Maybe I really should have gotten four, I thought, eyeing my now half-empty glass.
 
“Are the rest of you planning to sleep through your days off like Bobbie here?” I asked.
 
“I’ll be out like Sleeping Beauty,” Bobbie said, pretending to snore.
 
“Eh, you know I can’t sit still that long,” Jordan chimed in. “Besides, I’ve got plenty to catch up on at home. With these crazy hours, I’ve barely felt like taking out the trash this week.”
 
Dakota took a puff from their inhaler, inhaling deeply, then exhaling with a series of coughs. “I’ll be down for some rest for my back, but I can’t say I want to sleep it all away. I heard the city is supposed to throw a small festival tomorrow to celebrate this step toward a better future.”
 
“Really?” I replied. “That sounds like it could be fun. We should all go together. Come on, Bobbie, oh pal! Won’t you wake up to go to a festival with me?” I teased, nudging them with my shoulder.
 
“Fine,” they said, drawing out the word in fake exasperation. “Just for you.”
 
“Awe, you’ll give up sleep for me? You do care,” I teased, and the table erupted in laughter.
 
I downed the last half of my glass. “Now let’s celebrate!”
 
“More drinks coming up!” Dakota said, standing to grab the next round.
 
As we said our goodbyes outside the Den, I questioned my decision to drink so much. It wasn’t a terrible walk home, but the trolley had stopped running., So now I had no choice. The three blocks that would’ve felt like nothing when sober now felt overwhelming as I stumbled through the streets. Even still, I found myself humming along to one of my favorite songs playing on a loop in my head. There were just too many good things happening at the moment, and despite feeling dizzy…oh,  woo, I feel dizzy.
 
I leaned against the wall to steady myself. Blarg… I vomited all over the wall and sidewalk. It took a few moments of both puking and dry heaving for my stomach to settle. I stayed leaned against the wall, as I puffed on my inhaler grateful that my building was just ahead—maybe fifty feet away. At least throwing up had sobered me up just slightly.
 
Suddenly a high-pitched scream penetrated the fog in my mind. I jumped and turned too fast, nearly falling over in fright. It was that noise again, haunting and chilling to the bone. It was longer this time, but the lights were really on now. I took a deep breath, rationalizing the noise, and steadied myself to head home.
 
Shakily, I stood and walked to my apartment. As I passed the last lamppost at the door to my building, I paused. I felt like someone was standing right behind me. I looked down, and beside my shadow was another shadow—larger and misshapen. Fear surged through me as I jerked my head around, but there was nothing there. I sighed in relief, convincing myself I must just be seeing double. I laughed it off and went inside.
 
I barely made it to the bathroom before I started puking again, hugging the toilet until it was over. After rinsing my mouth with mouthwash, I poured myself a glass of water. As I sipped the water, I decided to look out the window at the lights we worked so hard on and put so much hope in!
 
As I stared at the soft white glow emitted by the crystals through the haze of smog, it appeared as if someone was standing in the middle of the lamp’s glow. I squinted, trying to get a closer look, and as my breath fogged up the window, It caught in shock. The figure I was looking at had no skin, just muscle and ligaments, wet and glistening. Just as I realized what I was seeing, a high-pitched scream filled the night.
 
I dropped my glass in terror, the scream turning my blood to ice. I glanced at the broken glass and back up to the street. Nothing was there. I rubbed my eyes and looked again—still nothing.
 
“Okay, Sam, you’re super tired and more than a little drunk. You must be hallucinating. Yeah, that’s it. I’m just seeing things.” I cleaned up the water and glass, then, with one last glance at the empty street, lay down, my consciousness slipping away into sleep.
 
 I wake up coughing, immediately reaching for my inhaler. My throat sore from last night’s retching. After a moment, I catch my breath and get up to grab a glass of water, only to realize my bladder needs more urgent attention. As I relieve myself, I notice the mouthwash from last night didn’t fully do the trick. I take care of that too, brushing my teeth again.
 
I jump into the shower, cranking the heat as high as I can stand. The steam helps loosen up my lungs, and I start coughing up black, mucousy bits.. Afterward, I hit my inhaler again before finally pouring that glass of water. It feels soothing on my dry throat.
 
“Okay, now something for my head,” I mutter, grabbing a bottle of aspirin. I throw back two pills with the rest of my water, then find something comfortable but still somewhat fashionable to wear to the festival. I feel like I’ve been hit by a truck. “I can’t handle hangovers like I used to,” I say with a sigh as I head out the door. Despite the exhaustion, excitement is building.
 
When I get to the Den, I’m the first of my friends to arrive. A server comes over as I sit down.
 
“I don’t usually see you here this early, Sam,” says Casey.
 
“Yeah, we decided we’d check out the festival together. I’m just waiting on the rest,” I reply.
 
“Anything I can get you while you wait?”
 
“Some coffee, for sure. And maybe a couple of eggs with toast. I need something to settle my stomach.”
 
I tap my toes to the music as I wait. Jordan shows up next, followed by Dakota and our food. Bobbie still hasn’t arrived By the time we finish eating.
 
“I guess Bobbie’s sleeping in after all,” Dakota says.
 
“So much for really loving me,” I quip with a laugh.
 
Jordan, starting to get fidgety, suggests, “Why don’t we go ahead and check out the festival? We can come back in an hour to see if Bobbie’s here by then.”
 
“Alright,” I agree. “Let me just ask Casey to tell Bobbie the plan if they show up.”
 
The festival took up an entire block of Main Street downtown, with food vendors, game stalls, and colorful decorations everywhere. Crowds had already started forming, the excitement buzzing in the air like static. The smell of fried treats filled my nose, reigniting my appetite. Over the roar of the festival-goers, I could faintly hear music.
 
“You hear that?” I ask, leading my friends toward the sound. “I think a band’s playing. Let’s check it out.”
 
We join the crowd in front of the stage just as the band finishes a song. It’s a group of four musicians with a grungy, rock aesthetic, playing covers of popular songs. As they launch into the next song, I’m surprised to hear my favorite. I can’t help but jump up and down with the crowd, singing along with the lyrics.
 
We stay and listen for a while, caught up in the energy until Dakota reminds us of the time. Reluctantly, we head back to the Den to see if Bobbie’s finally woken up.
 
“Hey Casey,” I say as we walk in from the street. “Has Bobbie shown up yet?”
 
Casey shakes their head. “No, I still haven’t seen them.”
 
“Well, their loss,” I say, shrugging. “Why don’t we grab a drink here where it’s cheaper? If Bobbie doesn’t show by the time we’re done, we’ll have Casey tell them to meet us at the stage. The festival’s not huge; we’ll find each other if they show.”
 
As we settle in with our drinks, I overhear a conversation on the news playing across the bar.
 
“With the start of the Crystal Initiative today, some residents have reported a bizarre screaming noise coming from the new lights,” the anchor says.
 
“That’s right,” a second voice chimes in, “but not to worry. Experts are advising this is a completely natural byproduct of the new system, and they’re hard at work to fix it.”
 
The first voice returns, sounding more upbeat. “Remember, this is just a temporary problem for a long-term solution, folks. The noise is just that—noise.”
 
I turn my attention back to my friends, who are deep in a debate about how easy the milk bottle game looks. The objective was simple: toss a ball at a stack of milk bottles and knock them down.
 
“I could knock ’em down in one throw,” Jordan says confidently.
 
“I don’t know,” Dakota interjects. “Everyone I saw was having a pretty hard time with it.”
 
“Yeah, but they’re not me,” Jordan retorts with a grin.
 
“And what makes you more qualified than them to knock down bottles?” I ask, finishing my beer. “You got some secret hobby we don’t know about?”
 
Jordan shrugs. “Well, no… but I’m naturally athletic. It’s in the genes, Sam..”
 
“Uh-huh,” I laugh. “Well, looks like Bobbie’s gonna miss all the fun. Let’s go so you can show us just how naturally athletic you are.”
 
“Thanks, Casey!” I shout on our way out the door. “You know where we’ll be if Bobbie ever shows up.”
 
On the way to the game, I couldn’t resist stopping at a few food stalls. I grab some kabobs, a taco, a soft pretzel, and some fried Oreos. I share my spoils with my friends, knowing I won’t be able to finish it all but wanting to try everything.
 
It took Jordan five tries to finally knock all the bottles down. Dakota, on the other hand, had a muscle spasm in their back mid-throw, and accidentally knocked them all down on their first try.
 
We played a few more games, then decided to grab some drinks and listen to the new band on stage. They had more of a folk vibe, playing mellow music that set a peaceful mood, with a calm joy emanating from both the speakers and the crowd.
 
Next, the mayor stepped onto the stage.
 
“First, I’d like to thank everyone for coming out today to celebrate the beginning of the Crystal Initiative,” he began, his voice carrying across the square. “As you all know, since the destruction caused by the Last War, the world outside this city has been uninhabitable, consumed by radiation. And as a byproduct of our survival, our city has been blanketed in smog, causing health and safety concerns for us all.” He paused, punctuating his statement with a cough.
 
“But today,” the mayor continued, his voice rising with hope, “these crystal lighting filtration systems will help clear the smog and light our way to a brighter, cleaner future!”
 
Applause erupted from the crowd, but it was cut short by a chilling, high-pitched scream.
 
“Heeeeeeeeeelp!”
 
The sound pierced the air, causing some people to cover their ears and others to clutch their children in fear. It was long, loud, and seemed to come from every direction at once. It wasn’t just a scream—it was the sound of someone pleading for help, raw and agonized as if nothing but pain and despair could escape their throat.
 
I froze, my mind spiraling into a dark place. But the mayor’s voice brought me back.
 
“Don’t worry!” he called out, trying to regain control. “Our scientists and engineers will have that fixed before you know it. The cleaner air we’re already starting to enjoy will be well worth these minor disruptions. Once again, thank you all for coming out tonight. Have safe travels home.” 
 
The crowd clapped hesitantly as the mayor left the stage, and I realized how late it had gotten.
 
“I’m going to stop by Bobbie’s place on my way home,” I said. “They said they would come, and despite being tired, that’s just not like them. It may just be that scream, but I feel like something is wrong.” “
 
I still have chills from it,” said Dakota.
 
“I’m sure it’s just the noise and your imagination,” Jordan remarked with a wave. “Later.”
 
When I got to Bobbie’s apartment, there was no answer, so I used the key under the mat to go in and check if everything was okay. I looked all over the small apartment, but Bobbie was nowhere to be found.
 
“This isn’t like them to just disappear and not show up.” My concern turned to worry as I locked up. “Nothing I can do at the moment,” I said to myself, deciding to head home.
 
I couldn’t stop thinking about what could’ve happened to Bobbie. Were they sick? Did they go to the hospital? Was there an accident? Anything that could go wrong had already played out in my mind.
 
The icy chill in the wind was a stark contrast to yesterday’s warmth. As I neared my building, I saw a figure standing in the same spot as last night, bringing back memories of my hallucinations. I slowed my pace, approaching with hesitance. I saw the same thing as before, but now with more detail. My mind struggled to comprehend it, fear and confusion filling my brain.
 
It was as if two bodies had been fused at the back, an amalgamation of arms and legs with two heads. What I thought were muscles last night now looked like badly burned flesh, almost melting off the bones. I froze, fear gluing me to the spot. I didn’t want to look, but I couldn’t pull my eyes away. It wasn’t just standing there — it was writhing in pain. It looked like it was trying to scream, and though I was terrified, part of me felt heartbroken, still not understanding what I was seeing.
 
I started to slowly move closer, curiosity battling my fear. The creature didn’t react, so I got even closer. As I did, I noticed I could almost see through it, like it was ethereal or some kind of projection — as if it wasn’t there. I stepped into the light, feeling more confident it was just an illusion.
 
But when I reached out to wave my hand through it, the creature turned both of its heads toward me and grabbed my forearm. I heard it scream, “Help me.” It was the same scream I’d been hearing, but this time I heard it clearly — an agonizing cry for help. My forearm burned with a cold, unlike anything I’d ever felt, searing my skin. My heartbeat pounded in my ears as chills ran through my body. I felt faint, and the world went black.
 
I awoke instantly, terrified, shuffling out of the light. There was nothing there. My arm throbbed with pain. I looked down, clutching it with my other hand. A handprint—burned into my skin—marked my forearm like I’d been branded. Panic surged through me.
 
Standing up, I held my burning arm tight against my chest and ran. Faster than I had in years. I sprinted straight to my apartment. It wasn’t far, but by the time I reached my building, I was already gasping for air. I frantically searched my pockets for my inhaler, the pain, confusion, and panic making it hard to focus. As I reached the stairs, my fingers finally closed around the familiar shape of it.
 
Wheezing and coughing, I inhaled a puff as I raced down the hall. Once inside, with the door locked behind me, I collapsed onto the floor, taking another hit from the inhaler. My body heaved as I coughed, black mucus splattering the floor. It took a long time before I could breathe again, my lungs still burning. But at least now, I could tend to my arm.
 
I immediately ran cool water over my arm, feeling temporary relief as the burn’s pain dulled. With my free hand, I reached under the sink for the first aid kit. I rummaged through it, trying to keep the burn under the water. I found the burn cream and gauze, fumbling to bandage my arm.
 
Once wrapped, I took some aspirin, then collapsed into bed, pulling the covers tightly around me. My heart still pounded in my chest. What the hell just happened? I thought to myself, staring into the dark.
 
What was that? Is that what happened to Bobbie? What do I do—what can I do? Are they coming from the crystals? Or maybe the crystals are attracting them? This is crazy. If it weren’t for the pain in my arm, I’d think I was losing it, but this is all too real.
 
Help me—
 
Another scream slices through the night. I shiver, pulling the covers tighter around me. My arm reignites with pain as fear tightens in my chest.
 
The screams keep coming, louder, longer, more frequent. Each time, the plea for help gets clearer, sinking into me. I can’t tell where it’s coming from—it’s everywhere like it’s surrounding me, crawling into my mind. I thought they’d stop at dawn, but when I looked out the window, the lights were still on, and more of those things were flickering in and out of the streetlights.
 
What is this? Why is this happening?
 
Maybe there’s something on the news. I fumble for the radio, flipping it on.
 
Beeeeeeeeep, beeeeeeeep, beeeeeeeep. This is not a test. This is an emergency broadcast. We urge all residents to remain in their homes. Do not enter the streets, and stay away from direct crystal lighting. We are working toward a solution. Please stay tuned for updates. Beeeeeeeep,
 
I turn the dial. It’s the same on every station.
 
I sink back into my chair, staring out the window. More questions, no answers. “They’re working on it,” I whisper to myself. “Everything will be okay.” But why haven’t they turned the lights off?
 
My arm throbs again, so I clean and re-dress the burn, trying to keep myself busy. I make some coffee, forcing myself through breakfast. The screams keep breaking the silence every few minutes, and I watch the creatures flicker in and out of the light, their forms twisting in ways that make me feel sick.
 
By mid-afternoon, the screams come every fifteen minutes. The creatures aren’t flickering anymore. There are more of them now, all solid. They move freely through the light, their motions jerky and erratic. Some claw at their faces, others wave their hands in confusion. Some look humans shaped, but others—blobs of flesh, piles of melted bodies, grotesque forms that make my stomach churn. Slimy, like exposed tissue. I can’t take my eyes off them, but I wish I could.
 
I hear the radio crackle, shifting from the endless loop to a live broadcast. My heart leaps as I scramble to turn up the volume.
 
“I wish I was coming to you with better news,” the mayor’s voice began, strained and weary. “But the reality is, we have no more answers now than we did this morning. All attempts to shut off the crystals have resulted in fatalities. Worse, the continued light from them seems to be making the situation worse, but we don’t yet know why. We have people working around the clock for a solution, but what was once seen as our salvation has quickly become a nightmare.”
 
He paused, and my stomach dropped. “We urge you to stay inside, away from these creatures. They are dangerous. Please, stay safe, citizens.”
 
The transmission cut off, replaced by the same emergency loop, but the mayor’s words echoed in my mind. Fatalities. They’ve lost control. If that’s what they’re telling the public, it’s already worse than they’ll admit. They never tell us how bad things are—not until it’s too late.
 
Despair washed over me. I crawled into bed, pulled the covers over my head, and let the tears fall.
 
I woke up hours later. By this time, there was no break from the screams—a constant cacophony of overlapping cries for help. As I looked outside, the streets were covered in gruesome, mutilated bodies. They weren’t just in the light anymore; those with legs and the ability to move were walking and running around aimlessly as more and more appeared in the lights. I choked back a sob as hopelessness set in. I pulled my burning arm to my chest, terrified of what they would do to me.
 
I went to the radio, doubting I’d hear anything new and not daring to hope. I turned the knob; it was just the beeping. I sighed and was about to turn it off when a voice came on.
 
“Can you hear me? I don’t know why I’m asking; you can’t respond. Heck, I don’t even know if anyone is still out there. As you know by now, these monsters are overrunning the city. Anyone who comes into contact with them dies, consumed by burning pain until they ultimately succumb. I guess now I’m just wasting time, waiting for my death.”
 
“Oh no,” I whispered, watching as the door to my building collapsed from the force of one of them ramming into it. That meant they were now in my building. I panicked, shoving my bed and furniture in front of the door.
 
The voice continued, “I’ve been a part of this project from the start, and I have some theories about what’s going on—but that’s all they’ll ever be: theories.”
 
I told myself I’d be fine—I was on the second floor. I watched as more and more of them found their way inside off the street. Grabbing my inhaler, I struggled to breathe, panic tightening my chest. I tried to focus on the voice coming from the radio.
 
“I believe everyone who died as the nukes went off in the Last War was somehow trapped in that moment—the moment of their death, in agony. They somehow became the radiation.”
 
I heard shuffling in the hallway outside my door. “How…how did they get up here so fast?” My breathing grew worse, and my arm was burning more fiercely. All rationality was gone at this point, and I had no idea what to do. Frantically, I paced my small apartment. I was scared; I didn’t want to die. I didn’t want to hurt. Tears were streaming down my face.
 
The voice continued, “When these crystals formed, they absorbed the radiation—or rather, the haunted souls. And somehow, when we started converting that energy, we released these agonizing souls back into the world.”
 
They were banging and clawing at my door. Light seeped through the cracks as it began to break. I crouched in the corner farthest from the door, wrapped in my blanket, crying and listening to the last voice I would probably ever hear.
 
Is this what happened to Bobbie? Are the rest of my friends still alive? Are they trapped and terrified like I am?
 
The voice on the radio cleared his throat. “Ah…I hear them. They’re getting closer. I’ll probably be going soon. It seems the sins of the past are catching up to us.”
 
They were through my door now, in my apartment. I couldn’t help but wonder, now in the end, after everything we’ve done, if humanity ever deserved to exist at all. As their hands closed around me, burning, I screamed, “Help me!”—fading into the endless chorus of screams.

I’ve been feeling like I’m on a hamster wheel for ages, in a cycle of either making academics my entire personality or basically not doing anything but pretending to (trying to fake it till I make it e.g. sitting in the library and getting nothing done) if that makes sense. I’m in the latter phase right now. I constantly feel discouraged from extracurricular rejections and my peers doing exceedingly well both in and out of school, while I struggle to even keep up with schoolwork. 

I was able to maintain an okay but not perfect GPA last year, but now, I’m really in the trenches with orgo and am doing worse than most of the class. With two midterms coming up back-to-back next week, I know I have to get it together, but I feel so hopeless that even while drinking cups and cups of coffee trying to stay up, I can’t focus and just end up setting a pomodoro timer only to stop it in the middle to scroll through my emails (? I literally deleted social media but still find a way to waste time), or just lose concentration and find my eyes glossing over the same sentence over and over again. I don’t want to do this anymore, and I know I have to snap out of it. 

The thing is, I’d like to think I can put in a better effort, but I don’t know if I can—because this keeps happening. Any assignment seems to take me forever because I keep snapping out of focus, and I feel like I can’t get anything done. If I do get it done, I didn’t do it well enough. I really, really want to stop but I’ve just become so jaded that I’m so close to throwing in the towel and calling it quits on any ambitions I had. 

If anyone can relate, I’d really appreciate any advice. It feels like such an isolating experience and being told to just “get it done” when it comes to everything does not help. I don’t know what to do.

1gcdkl7,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1gcdkl7/question_about_mixed_signals_from_asking_her_out/,"Question about mixed signals from asking her out ? , Im 27 M and she is 21 F","I recently started a new job about 2 months ago , i met this girl there that started at the same time as me . Long story short it took me until about a week ago to finally work up the courage to ask her out .  At first I had reservations about asking her out because of circumstances in my own life like considering the fact that I’m trying to focus on my self right now ( going back to school , working , etc ).However I've come to the realization that there will never be a ""perfect time"" and if I never take action at pursuing a relationship there will never be one. Anyway I asked her if she wanted to grab a coffeee with me one day after work or whenever she has some free time, she smiled and said yeah I would like to and to text her so we can work out our schedules ( she didnt actually give me her number, i only have it because we are both in a group chat with our coworkers ) . So the dilemma is that I texted her the next day asking if she was free on a certain day and if not lets try to coordinate something, she didn't reply for three days, The next time I saw her at work was two days after I sent the text ( so a day before she actually replied , which I will get to ) and I pretty much said "" Hey I just wanted to see if you were still up for that coffee ? , since i haven't heard back from you "" and she said  ""Sorry about that I've been trying to just disassociate lately from my phone and what not "" ( keep in mind I see her on her phone all the time, and its 2024 everyone is on their phone ) . I forgot what I said after this but I pretty much said "" oh okay I understand , just let me know anytime your down, and she said maybe sometime in November( when we had this conversation it was about october 20 ) . So the next day she finally responds to my text saying "" Hii truly sorry for the late response :\\ but truly ive been feeling off lately, just typical life things hahaha but as soon as I feel better Ill deff let you know "" I pretty much replied and said no problem at all , I hope whatever you are going through gets better and hopefully we can work something out soon, after that we texted a bit about work(mostly how she hates the job). SO that's pretty much the story so far, when we first got hired at the job and interacted we would sometimes talk about basic stuff like school, where she's from, the job etc and I noticed she was pretty outgoing and always made it a point to say hi to me. I feel like ever since I asked her out her attitude has shifted, shes less talkative, I feel like she actively avoids making eye contact with me and I dont know I just feel like her demeanor has changed. I feel like she might have felt pressured to say yes when I asked her out and to be nice just said yes. What do you guys think of the situation ? ",3,1729918599.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

1gcdgd4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gcdgd4/aita_is_it_my_brothers_psycho_ex_or_toxic_friends/,AITA? Is it my brother’s psycho ex or toxic friends?,"Sorry for the long story but I need to know AITA?

In late 2018  I moved in with my childhood best friend (AM) and her roommate (BG) as a stop gap after uni and we all hit it off. We all got on so well and I fast became friends with the AM and over the next few years saw her as my best friend. 

I moved in with my future husband (CT) and we remained extremely close, going out all the time and seeing each other multiple times a week. We shared our highs and our lows and I thought I’d found someone I could truly trust and was comfortable sharing anything with, as she did with me. 

Through lockdown we started going on social distance walks with us 10m away from each other with other households including my brothers and as measures slowly lifted we all became extremely close, with BG and my brother DS becoming an item. 

Through the easing of lockdown and our group had been meeting regularly and meeting at a distance almost daily as we were all furloughed and we became extremely close. These were friends myself, my be AM and CT had known for the best part of a decade and included my future Maid of honour JL, her partner SD, my brother’s close friend VE and her future husband and my brother’s roommate AL. My dad, step mom and grandparents also welcomed her as a part of the family. As lockdown lifted we all remained very close and hung out regularly. 

Side note as well because i want to be fair, during lockdown  was terrified of needles and she would take me to appointments for covid jabs or my regular blood tests because I used to faint and she would always be there if I was feeling low or having a recurrence of depression or anxiety attacks and we would regularly lean on each other when we felt low, sharing about past trauma and we both seemed to be very equal terms friendship time. 

Around 2021 she moved into her own place, a 2 bed terrace and at the time my brother had been renting with two roommates, one of whom was my brothers childhood best friend JB and the other AL who had him as best man but he was ready to take the next step if asked. She adamantly didn’t want him to move in despite the timing being when most people move in together and it would mean bills would be halved for them but we all understood as no one should be rushed until they’re ready. I did find it strange that she had certain rules such as only letting him over on so many days a week because she “needed her space” and she would be annoyed if he showed up unannounced (I don’t believe she was cheating). Around this time she also started to told that she had fibromyalgia and complex depression and anxiety. At the time she was also frequently job hopping and finally settled on a job in a cafe working under a friend as her manager.

She frequently took time off work for sick leave citing mental health or fibromyalgia but was still able to attend multiple social functions. She also frequently flipped between sobriety and priding herself on being sober for x amount of day/weeks/months etc and then allowing herself to drink for “special occasions”. I am not saying this in a nasty way because I lost a mother to alcohol but it was very pick and choose with her and hard to keep track. 

When her tenancy came up for renewal she decided she couldn’t afford it and instead of moving in with my brother she decided to move into shared housing which happened to belong to a close friend and another friend was also living there LB. Again my brother  had limited days he could see her and this seemed more excuse to not have him round as much. 

She came out to my dad’s wedding in America in summer 2021 as my brother’s GF and had got close with my step mum as well when she was visiting England from the time of lockdown lifting to the wedding and seemed to really bond.

Not long after the wedding she broke up with my brother and she disclosed to me that she had been thinking about it before the wedding but so much had been spent on it she didn’t feel she could back out (she also had the audacity to wear vans in the family wedding photo which my dad and step mom have to see every time they show off the pictures despite being asked to wear formal as a family member).

I told her that despite the breakup I wanted things to remain civil and I wanted to be both a good sister and a loyal friend as our friendship predated their relationship but I would not be relaying messages or rising to gossip. This seemed to work and I balanced it well, making my boundaries clear to both. 

My brother was deeply hurt over the breakup and asked her to give him another try. My brother did message her a lot with very long messages and there were a lot of phone calls discussing feelings but this was made worse by the fact that they repeatedly blocked and unblocked each other and she was so indecisive. There was almost a year of backwards and forwards but she agreed to get back together and they went away on holiday and things seemed to be going well. 

There was a strange incident when we had been for a meal for my dad’s birthday and his 85 year old mother had come up from the south. After the meal we went for drinks in town and I noticed BG and my brother talking and she stormed off. It turned out she was on a sober episode an only drinking decaf coffee and wanted to go home but my brother wanted to stay out later and celebrate his dad’s birthday and be with his family. She had accused him of being “emotionally manipulative” for asking her to stay out in a puppy dog way when she wanted him to walk her home. Bearing in mind this is his father’s birthday. At this point my dad lost it and told my brother he needs to cut ties because she is manipulating him and my Nan who usually bites her tongue was furious. It ruined my dad’s birthday. 

Once they broke up again she disclosed she got back together because she hated hearing him so upset and “loved him so much but didn’t want to break his heart”. She said she had seen him more as a friend and “it felt like having sex with her brother”. Obviously I found this wildly inappropriate but stupidly let it slide rather than calling her out on it. I overstepped a little because I had sworn to be impartial but I knew it would hurt my brother to continue and told her she had to end it. 

I had met her for a few drinks and instantly she offloaded that my brother had been “emotionally blackmailing” her and that she felt she couldn’t leave but I could find no evidence of emotional blackmail, only someone who couldn’t make her mind up. Admittedly there were a lot of messages spilling his soul from my brother and phone calls trying to get her back but she had the power to block him and kept doing that then unblocking him. 

After she ended it the second time it was a bit more of a nasty break up. My brother drove hundreds of miles in snowy weather wanting to end it but I believe he felt so low it was a cry for help. It was VERY who alerted us to this and my dad drove to get him as his car had died. 

At this point she refused to speak to him. She claimed she had received multiple phone calls off him and “couldn’t go back there”. I respected that and kept a good separation between her and my brother… until May 2022. 

She had been asked to be a bridesmaid at one of my brother’s best friends’ wedding of over a decade VE and his best friend and former roommate AL. My brother was best man. My brother had been dating a girl SB for 5 months and was getting serious, she is now his fiancé. He asked if she could come to the evening reception and they said yes. Shortly after this he travelled to America to see my dad and got a message saying SB could not attend. He explained that he was back from America only a day before and wouldn’t see her before the wedding and hadn’t seen her for over 2 weeks. They again declined. 

The wedding was at a location with a barn wedding venue, cabins and an old building that it’s apartments and hot tubs. The night before the male wedding party were in one and the female wedding party in the other and the bride and groom in another. My brother asked if she could just come to the cabin in the evening to hang out once the party had died down as other men in the cabin had their partners present but this was declined. 

This was all because his ex who he had broken up with almost a year ago didn’t want her at the wedding because i”it would make her feel uncomfortable”. 

Because of this not only my brother but my 85 year old grandmother who had accompanied him to America to see her son, but my dad and step mom also had to get dragged into the drama because my brother was so stressed and upset over it. 

Me and my future sister in law LB have a great relationship and we chatted through this and she was so lovely about it but a little bit miffed. She was still new and a little shy and didn’t want to get involved in drama and I salute her composure but the couple didn’t allow her to come and his ex got her way. Because of this and VE and AL taking his ex’s side over this SB now has no trust in them and is incredibly reserved around them. 

At this wedding there was a Scottish guy (who I will refer to as The Predator) who was making a pass at every girl around. There were two girls who left because he had made them feel uncomfortable and they retreated to their rooms early on because of this. Another woman’s partner threatened him if he got any closer and my close childhood friend had to tell him to back off from my brother’s ex. Later in the evening he forcibly kissed her on the dance floor. 

Later that evening my FH and I went back to the apartment to change into bathing gear for the hot tub. I walked downstairs in my swimming costume and The Predator was on the couch despite being assigned the male wedding party cabin. He beckoned me over and being a nurse I worried about his wellbeing. He told me to take my clothes off. I told him I didn’t think my fiancé would appreciate that and went into the kitchen to pour a drink. He followed me and reached for my crotch. Panicked I ran for the hot tub where I could see other people. 

I told them what had happened and they brushed it off as “he was drunk” (these were friends of the bride and groom I’d met that day). I was afraid to tell my fiancé in case he punched him as punching a very drunk person can be fatal due to thinner blood. I spent the whole night terrified and clinging to people and the room didn’t lock so that worried me even though my partner was there. 

A few days after the wedding me and my brother’s ex shared stories about him and she said other women had been harassed and she felt uncomfortable. She had also disclosed previously she had been in an abusive relationship and raped. 

About a month after the wedding I had a get together to ask my best friends to be my bridesmaids. She was so excited about it and instantly accepted and started talking about plans. I know it sounds odd but up until this point our friendship had been solid despite the red flags but I always told myself it was for her and my brother. My dad was annoyed and said after the drama with the wedding he never wanted to see her again but she’d been there for me through some of the worst experiences of my life I thought she’d earned it. 

Around this time our friends including me, my future husband CT, my brother, his ex, my future Maid of Honour JL and her partner SD, 
VE and AL had booked an Airbnb for a festival in England. Because of the shift in dynamics after the wedding this became really complicated. My brother and his ex agreed they couldn’t share a room, obviously and SB decided to buy a camping ticket. I had reserved a room at the Airbnb but decided to camp with my brother, SB and their friends instead and I would instead allow another friend to take my place which I had paid for at the Airbnb.

I contacted this person to get money and AL and VE had instead taken money off him and he told me he had paid them instead of me. When I contacted AL and VE they refused to give me the money saying there was an option to book it for 6 or for 8 and because it was booked for 8 (even though without me and my brother it was 6) they wouldn’t pay me. Because my brother sacrificed his space to avoid conflict he also lost his money which I told him should have been paid by his ex.  I had pulled out of the festival and sold my ticket but lost £200 on the Airbnb. 

My brother’s fiancée SB told me she felt she had got on well with everybody and her and his ex made small talk, even sharing water and that barriers were coming down. 

A few weeks later BG told me they had been messaging and The Pervert was a completely different person. I was shocked and didn’t know what to say. As this progressed she became more besotted, telling me he was off the drink and had been going through a messy divorce and wasn’t himself. Around this time I found out from another friend he had taken LSD at the wedding and had been tripping the whole evening. 

As time progressed she seemed to meet him more often. She was visiting him often in Scotland and him in our hometown. I met with her one evening and said if he had changed perhaps we could look at trying to meet some time but I would expect a full apology and my future husband would be harder to come round as he wants to punch the guy but if he was important to her I’m willing to try. My husband and I met with her one evening and discussed the logistics of her attending our wedding as a bridesmaid. As she was on a low wage/PIP/sick leave I offered to find a villa to share with our old roommate and some others to bring costs down and offered to help. The topic of her partner came up and I said I was trying to smooth things out but at present if my partner saw hers he would probably be defensive him so it would take time and that it wasn’t possible for him to come to the wedding (bearing in mind that had been dating a few weeks). We had a few more drinks and chatted and laughed then abruptly she said she needed to get home. 

Later I received a message stating she had a mental health crisis and had moved in with her dad and couldn’t be a part of the wedding and needed some space. She had had multiple mental health crises while I’d known her so I responded to look after herself and I was there if she needed anything and to send me a message let me know she’s ok and that I could pop round for coffee in a few days if she wanted. 

After a few days I started to get worried. I contacted our old roommate AM who spoke regularly and she said she hadn’t heard anything. I started to worry something sinister had happened on the walk home and that was why she had gone to her dads and he was contacting people. I was so concerned I persisted to contact her despite her dad saying she needed space because I was genuinely worried and previously when she had been on the verge of suicide it had helped her to know she had friends. 

She responded that she needed to “get her head and health sorted”. She was worrying about too much has happened to be away with people where there was friction and that would harm her mental health. I accepted that and said I understood and would always be there and we’d cat soon. 

Then I got a message from my brother’s fiancé saying she’d been blocked by her on Facebook and I noticed I had. I sent her a message, confused that she’d blocked me. She replied agree that we’ve  been there for each ou in difficult times. She then said end of the friendship wasnt the wedding, it was the situation I putting me in with her new boyfriend, asking me to relay things back and forth (asking for an apology) when he was the only person truly listening to her and helping me during her breakdown (as I’d done countless times before) and I put him down regularly. I don’t think I’m out of line for this, in fact I was afraid I might be r***d so I was being overly accommodating here. 

She told me what I said about my brother (which was minimal) “came out incredibly head f**ky” and made her paranoid   She claimed she couldn’t talk to me about anything and “our friendship was becoming damaging” but I was always there I just couldn’t talk about him. She also admitted blocking me was “a cowards way out”. 

At this point I disclosed to VE, JL and AM I was very concerned about emotional abuse and with his demeanour and behaviour that this could become physical. JL agreed. 

A few weeks later I received a message saying we had been talking about her in a group chat. The topic was actually using photoshop to remove her from the wedding photo after the hurt she caused my brother and my family and it was not me commenting in the chat yet I received the brunt of it. 

Out of anger I responded “I hope you’re happy with the pervert”. 

Over the next few months I hear snippets from friends. Apparently he is calling all the time when she visits and she leaves gigs early to talk to him. More disturbingly I hear he called for phone s*x while his autistic pre-teen is in the room with him. I also heard from a good source she had been going around im his van all day while he does plumbing jobs, both taking c*caine and her playing the Nintendo all day. He then proposed with a silver and opal ring and the gem dropped out. VE and JL voices their concern and I heard they were watching the situation and I too have been worried. 

A few months later I hear she has turned up on VE and AL’s doorstep with a kitten saying she has left because he is emotionally abusive. When AL took her up to collect her things he apparently sat half dressed in the living room playing guitar and shouting abuse at her, in front of his supposed best friend AL. 

She decided to get a flat in Scotland rather than return to her hometown in the north west. 

Now the question for me really is how should I feel about this. I have so many mixed feelings: loss, hurt, anger, sympathy, I’m sad to admit it gloat, distrust, disappointment, sadness. 

So fast forward a year or so after our last interaction to tonight and I got really angry. I found out 3rd hand there had been a Halloween party hosted by my best friend JL and she had been invited, along with VE and another friend in the group. 

JL knows how lonely I’ve been for the past 12 months and how miserable I’ve been since moving. I have no friends down here but I’ve noticed she gets invited to things over me now. JL claims it’s for her 30th but then where was my 30th? I spent it crying in bed with 5 cards. She can host a party for her but I don’t even get a card?

I get it I had a destination wedding and she came and I am eternally grateful but she knows the hurt she’s caused us all so why invite her, why allow her in her life?",1,1729918127.0,AITAH,0,0.67,False

My god, there is no question. There is no waiting. It's so silent, alone. The rain from the shower head is screaming warmth at my back but I feel only what I tell myself

...

There is great divide. 

...

God fuck, what *is it* that I love? Is it me? 

No. I found a thing out tonight.  Before I made my parliance and excuse. 

I found that I'm wholly susceptabile to idiocy... and will continue to fly in its direction.  

God fuck, do I love. What is that? Is it air I breathe or cotton? 

I should know better than free verse. I should know better than...what did I forget on my way to saying interoggative lie? 

I should know better than... 

I should...

Despotism comes into mind for other reasons. 

But no. 

I should know better than to have... now its my own indecision telling me stories. 

A child. Cold and damp. Freshly buried. 

Can I tell you who I am, or do you know better than I might?

Are you even reading anymore? My wide eyes yearn to know. 

Take in my lazy sprinkling of fairy dust for the evening...did you ever read the series you heard me talk about so long ago? Was that what you were doing? You always walk away so quickly when I mention a book. 

Beach Music. Pat Conroy. It's life. Thats what all the people say. Riding...

But I'd rather forget the empty shower. 

I obviously don't want the em-bland-ened morning coffee. I'd rather be angry at someone worth it. 

I've been angry before. 

Allow me the privilege. 

Don't make me enact the wrath on someone new. 

That's horseshit. 

You wouldn't want to hear me say that... I

1gcd3pq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gcd3pq,"Kingrinder P0, barely worked and broke after first use! ","Hi all, I got a Kingrinder P0 after waiting multiple months. After finally getting it I was extremely disappointed that it was extremely difficult to grind coffee. I could barely hold onto the body of the grinder, as I had to exert so much force it would lock the handle and spin the grinder in my hand. 

After a terrible, muddy cup I tried to grind for another cup to dial the grinder in. I couldn’t back off the adjustment wingnut. I had to tap it with a hammer to remove it. 

It seems the adjustment plate jammed into the rectangle shaft from all the force of grinding and ovaled out the hole. 


Are all hand grinders this difficult? I thought the Kingrinder P series was supposed to be decent for the price? 

Should I try another P0, a better P series, a K series, a 1zpresso, or just save for an electric grinder? ",0,1729916835.0,pourover,19,0.5,False

1gcd2a8,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1gcd2a8/last_broadcast/,Last Broadcast,"Deirdre Byrne's breath came in ragged gasps as she sprinted through the darkened radio station corridors. The backup generator cast everything in a sickly red glow, turning shadows into twisted, writhing things. Her feet pounded against carpet that felt too soft, too alive beneath her shoes.

Three days without sleep. Three days since the first crystalline growth had been discovered in the abandoned psychiatric facility across town. Three days of broadcasting warnings, coordinates of safe zones, and finally, desperate prayers. The last cup of coffee she'd managed to choke down sat like acid in her stomach. Now her prayers had been answered with the sound of segmented limbs scraping across tile floors.

Through the window of her engineering booth, she'd watched the Type-1 Stalkers enter – their elongated forms gliding through the lobby like oil on water. Their bodies moved with an unnatural fluidity, multiple joints bending in ways that made her stomach turn. Crystalline protrusions jutted from their jagged forms, reflecting no light. Where their faces should have been, hollow eye sockets emanated a phosphorescent glow, and their impossible maws were lined with rows of crystalline fangs.

The security desk was empty. Three days ago, she'd watched Bill, the night guard, walk out into the street with his neck bent at an impossible angle, singing in harmonics that made the windows vibrate. He'd become one of the Type-0 ""Twisted"" – those who had fought the transformation and lost, their bodies grotesquely warped but retaining fragments of consciousness. His uniform now hung in tatters from one of the Stalkers hunting her.

""This is Deirdre Byrne,"" she whispered into her phone, still recording for the emergency broadcast system. ""KCRW 89.9 is going dark. They're here. The Black Signal... it's changing everything. If anyone's still listening, still human... stay quiet. Stay hidden. The Stalkers hunt in coordinated packs, guided by shared psychic anguish. They can sense your emotional vulnerabilities.""

A wet, sliding sound from around the corner sent her ducking into the break room. Through the window, she could see what remained of the city. Black crystal growths burst from buildings like tumors, their surfaces seeming to swallow light. The sky hung low and bruised, pulsing with sick colors she had no names for. In the distance, the Hollywood sign had become a twisted spire of flesh and crystal, each letter transforming into something that reached toward the roiling clouds.

Her phone vibrated – messages still flowing through the community chat:

*they're coming through the walls now*
*the spires are bleeding shadows*
*my sister started singing and walked into that thing. her skin was changing*
*i can see through my bones and they're turning black*
*does anyone else taste colors? the air tastes like screaming*
*shelter at 4th/main compromised. Harvesters inside. all singing*
*police station gone. Weavers building nest structures*
*please someone help my children are*

The chat cut off as something dark dripped onto her phone's screen. She looked up. The ceiling tiles were weeping black fluid that moved against gravity. A Type-3 Phantom was phasing through the wall, its semi-transparent flesh blending with shadows. Its impossibly thin, almost two-dimensional form rippled like smoke.

Movement caught her eye. A Stalker unfolded itself in the doorway, its segmented body shifting and contorting beyond biological constraints. Where its face should have been, jagged crystal shards sprouted from torn flesh, catching the emergency lights like pools of blood. Around its elongated neck, she recognized the remains of a press pass lanyard – Johnson from the morning show. Last week they'd shared jokes about retirement plans. Now his transformed body blocked her only exit.

The thing that had been Johnson tilted its crystalline head. A sound emerged from somewhere inside its twisted form – a broken attempt at her name, mangled by vocal cords that had been rebuilt for screaming. She could see the Black Signal's influence in the way its skin appeared both necrotic and crystalline, in the tear-like tracks of black ichor that constantly seeped from its eyes.

She threw her coffee mug at its cluster of crystalline eyes and ran. The creature's shriek echoed through the halls, calling its pack. The sound made her inner ear twist, like fingernails scraping the inside of her skull. Behind her, she heard the wet slap of elongated limbs against the floor, the crackle of crystalline growths scraping walls.

Past the engineering booth where Mickey had shown her the ropes fifteen years ago – now transformed into a Type-C Echo, his retained human intelligence serving the Signal as a living archive. Past the wall of vinyl records she'd curated over her career – some of them pulsing now with inner light, playing frequencies that made listeners' teeth crystallize. She passed the framed photos of radio personalities now twisted into monsters, their images slowly distorting behind cracked glass.

Her legs burned, but she could hear them gaining – the click of blade-like protrusions, the wet sound of bodies that moved wrong, and that terrible singing that made her teeth feel like they were trying to grow. The pack was coordinating through their shared psychic network, some taking high ground along the walls, others flowing through vents and doorways like Type-3 Phantoms, all moving to cut off her escape routes.

The roof access. It was her only chance.

She slammed through the door and took the stairs three at a time. Behind her, Stalkers flowed up the stairwell, their elongated limbs coiling around railings as they pursued. One launched itself over the central gap, unfolding in mid-air like a bloody flower. She barely ducked under its grasping limbs, feeling the wind of crystalline claws passing inches from her neck.

The door to the roof burst open under her shoulder, cold air hitting her like a slap. The night sky churned with colors that belonged in deep ocean trenches, and the air itself felt thick, resistant, as if reality was beginning to congeal. The Black Signal was growing stronger, warping physical laws within its influence and creating patches of absolute darkness that seemed to breathe.

Deirdre stumbled to a stop. More Stalkers emerged from behind the rooftop equipment, their black-veined flesh rippling in waves. They moved like a hunting pack, herding her toward the edge of the roof. Below, the transformed city pulsed with sickly light that leaked from the spires. Streets had become rivers of writhing darkness. Buildings bent toward each other like twisted lovers, their structures weeping fluid that ate through concrete and steel.

""Okay,"" she whispered, backing up until her heels touched the low wall. ""Okay.""

The Stalkers tensed, blade-like protrusions unfolding for the kill. But then, as one, they froze. Their crystal-studded heads turned skyward, reflecting something new. The very air seemed to hold its breath.

Deirdre followed their gaze and felt her breath catch. The clouds were splitting open like infected wounds, spilling darkness that moved with purpose. Through these tears in reality came the Monarchs – Type-6 entities of immense power, their massive, ever-shifting forms serving as direct conduits of the Black Signal. Each emergence widened the wounds in reality, letting through glimpses of what lay beyond – a realm of twisted flesh and living crystal that had once been another world.

Six of them emerged from the dying sky, each one a mountain of twisted flesh and crystal that defied natural law. Where they passed, reality hemorrhaged in their wake, buildings and streets flowing like wax, people screaming as their bodies began to change. Their massive forms cast shadows that felt solid, that reached down to touch and transform whatever they fell upon.

Her phone erupted with final messages:

*THE SKY IS ROTTING*
*oh god i can see inside them*
*the song it's in my blood*
*please make it stop make it*
*they're so beautiful it hurts to*
*mommy why are your arms growing*
*the geometry makes sense now i understand i under*

The Stalkers began to convulse, their bodies responding to some deeper calling. Around the city, spires of living crystal wept black fluid that ate through whatever it touched. The Monarchs' presence was transforming everything it touched, and reality itself was screaming. The air rippled with visible frequencies, patterns of light and shadow that rewrote the laws of physics wherever they passed.

She found herself reaching for her phone one last time, journalist's instincts kicking in even now. ""This is Deirdre Byrne, still broadcasting,"" she said, her voice steady despite everything. ""I'm on the roof of KCRW. The Monarchs have emerged. They're... they're beyond description. Like something from the deepest ocean trench, but vast. Hungry. Their bodies are mountains of twisted flesh and crystal, and reality bleeds where they touch it.""

The Stalkers made no move to stop her. They were still focused on the sky, where something vast and dark was taking shape above the pole. The Hollow King – the unique Type-7 entity, possibly the first Reaper – was coming. The air grew thick with anticipation, and Deirdre could taste metal on her tongue – the flavor of reality preparing to tear.

""The transformation is accelerating,"" she continued, watching black crystal consume the city below. ""The spires are bleeding some kind of signal. Everything's changing. Everyone's changing. I can feel it starting, feel it in my blood. The frequencies they're broadcasting... they're not just sound. They're instructions for rewriting flesh.""

The Hollow King rose through the tear above the pole, its colossal form blotting out what remained of the sky. Black ichor rained from its segmented body, each drop spawning new horrors where it touched the earth. Its massive form towered above the clouds, a grotesque fusion of crystal and flesh that defied comprehension.

From its twisted torso extended four immense arms, each ending in enormous clawed hands that seemed crafted from living crystal and nightmare. Each massive hand bore elongated fingers tipped with crystalline talons, their surfaces reflecting impossible geometries that hurt to look at. As it ascended to the stratosphere, the creature spread its arms wide, its claws reaching toward the cardinal points of the compass like a cruel parody of a crucifixion.

The Stalkers around her were changing, their forms melting and reforming into something even more nightmarish. She watched as Johnson's transformed body split open like a flower made of meat and bone, crystal growths erupting from within as he evolved into a higher form. The other hunters followed suit, their screams of agony and ecstasy harmonizing with the Signal's song.

Her phone was growing into her hand now, black veins spreading up her arm. The Signal sang through her blood, and she could feel her bones trying to push through her skin. But she kept broadcasting, even as her voice gained harmonics that made the air ripple. She had to document this. Had to bear witness to humanity's final moments.

""This is Earth's last frequency,"" she said, feeling her jaw extend, new teeth pushing through her gums. Memories of her human life began to fracture and reform – childhood days rewritten with crystal logic, first kisses remembered with alien geometries. ""This is how we change. This is how we join their song. This is—""

The Hollow King's hands began to move in precise, ritual patterns, each gesture sending ripples through reality itself. Where its claws traced lines through the air, space itself seemed to tear and bleed. The crystalline talons caught and reflected light in ways that made the human mind recoil, each movement leaving trails of distortion in their wake.

As the Hollow King completed its terrible gesture, its hands aligned with the six Monarchs' spires, creating a pattern that seemed to pin reality itself in place. The spires pulsed in response, their crystalline forms resonating with frequencies that made the air bleed.

A sound beyond sound erupted from the Hollow King's maw - not a roar, but a remix of every scream, every prayer, every song humanity had ever sung, twisted into a frequency that rewrote the rules of flesh and physics. The pattern of its hands began to turn, and with each quarter rotation, the Monarchs' spires erupted with new light.

The sky cracked like glass. Through the fissures poured ribbons of writhing darkness that connected each spire to the Hollow King's crown of thorns and teeth. Reality bent, folded, and finally surrendered to the new geometries being forced upon it. A wave of transformation exploded outward from each spire, black crystal and mutating flesh claiming everything in its path.

Deirdre felt her body split and reform into something greater, something hungry. Her consciousness expanded, connected to the vast network of transformed minds that now spanned the dying Earth. The last thing her human eyes saw was the Hollow King completing its final rotation, its crystalline claws locked into place as Earth's atmosphere crystallized into eternal night.

In the days that followed, frequency analysts in other systems would detect new harmonics in the Black Signal – persistent whispers of terror, of transformation, of hungry transcendence. None would understand their true meaning until their own worlds faced the spires.

By then, the thing that had once been Deirdre Byrne had evolved far beyond human comprehension. As a Type-5 Siren, she found her purpose in helping others embrace their own transformations, her broadcast continuing eternally through the black crystal networks of what had once been Earth. Her voice, now carrying impossible frequencies, drew others to transcendence with the same skill she had once used to draw listeners to her radio show.

The frequency of shadows had gained a new voice, and the signal grew stronger. In the twisted spires that had once been cities, in the bleeding crystal that had once been oceans, in the screaming networks that had once been human minds, her final broadcast played on – a testament to the moment when humanity faced its metamorphosis and found it horrifying and perfect.

The transformation of Earth was complete, and the Hollow King turned its gaze to other worlds, its crystalline claws already reaching toward new horizons. Somewhere in the depths of its eternal broadcast, a fragment of Deirdre Byrne's human consciousness remained, forever documenting the symphony of flesh and crystal that Earth had become.

1gcd22j,https://www.reddit.com/r/AdhdRelationships/comments/1gcd22j/communication_style_problems_with_friends/,Communication style problems with friends ,"I was recently diagnosed with moderate to severe ADHD and I have only just started therapy this week. I have always struggled with making and keeping relationships including friendships and tonight highlighted one of the reasons why. 

I matched with a guy on Coffee Meets Bagle because we had a ton of mutual interests. One very big thing made us incompatible for a relationship but we found that we both enjoyed talking to each other and wanted to continue to be friends. So we met over drinks the other night. He also had ADHD but a more mild version and more of the hyperactive type rather than the inattentive type that I have. Well, my poor social skills took over and I was nervous and I talked too much and didn’t ask enough questions and he didn’t respond to me for a few days until tonight. 

Tonight he told me that he felt like I wasn’t very interested in getting to know him and he felt a bit ignored during the conversation. I did not intend that at all. I get so focused on what I’m trying to say that everything else kind of gets forgotten if it’s interjected and that’s what happened. He interjected something, I didn’t comment on it and it was important to him. I left that night and came home feeling like I had messed something up and I was right. I apologized and he accepted and said we could try again and I said we should discuss our communication styles together. He seemed very open to that. 

How do I learn to communicate with someone in a way that doesn’t make them feel ignored? If I’m telling a story and they interject something relevant but about themselves, do I stop telling my story to discuss that? If I don’t, I will forget about it. If I do, I will lose the thread of my own story. I’m so confused. How do people do this? 

For context, I’m just now putting myself out into the world again after getting out of a very LTR. I haven’t made new friends in a very long time and the ones I have are just as neurodivergent as I am so we communicate similarly. This guy has a very different communication style but we have so many common interests that I really want to get to know him. He’s someone I feel I can discuss my favorite genres of books with and that’s not easy to find in the real world. Normally I would not put this much effort into communicating with someone but he seems worth the effort and also open to my ND and non judgy about it. I want to communicate better with him but I also don’t want to have to mask with someone who is supposed to be a friend. Is this going to work even? Am I fooling myself?
