A few other random comments.  Vanilla Mocha Cafe I did not like at all.  It's too strong/coffee-like for me and I ended up using it mostly as bubble bath.  Sweet Whiskey I didn't like at first, then put it away for awhile and when I reopened it earlier this year I REALLY liked it.

I recently moved from Europe to Canada and have a bunch of appliances with the wrong voltage (they take 220V instead of 110V). Most of them will require an actual converter (not just an adapter) to function here and it's not worth it for me to invest in those.

What do I do with them now? Would hate to throw them in the garbage because they are all still functioning. Does anyone know a place that buys (or takes donations) of this kind of thing? Maybe for parts or whatever. Or maybe someone knows someone that is about to move to Europe and wants to take them?

Good-day everyone,  

I live on a farm and it gets lonely sometimes so I was searching for a pen-pal to persevere through the long days.  If you live on a farm also that is awesome but if you live in the city I  will try to explain what activities go on at the farm as accurately as possible. 

I did not grow up on a farm so I have lived other places and will try to share my stories to make the conversation more interesting.  If we only exchange letters once a year at Christmas time that will be okay.  If I live to be 100 that will be sixty letters written between two people or families which is a lot.  I okay with exchanging gifts that I can make on the farm that show creativity.  I enjoy creating things very much.  Please be a real person and I will try to answer any questions.  English is not my first language so I will try to learn simple sentences or your native language.  My dad has always said if I wanted to visit a foreign country I needed to learn their language so I believe that is true.

 

I am not married and never had a girlfriend so if your a female it will be exciting to speak to you but if not I get along with the guys too.

I celebrated the New Year with my parents and had pizza with vegetables for dinner.  One of my dreams if I ever had a business is to open a pizza parlor and try to make the best and healthiest pizza possible.  I live in a small town and one of the most prized foods are hamburgers, barbecue and vegetables.  Where I live is mostly farming so there is not a lot of entertainment but we have plenty of food.  You will never starve from lack of food here.  I enjoy drinking tea and coffee.  My family has just discovered a tea called Yaupon Holly that is a Native American small tree that grown wild here.

I’m running out of ideas but I hope you are in good health and that sunshine shines upon your face and may your garden be plentiful.

I played mostly soccer growing up as a kid which led to good health for most of my life.

I have a family with two sisters that have moved away from home.  I attended 4 year universities but never graduated with a bachelor’s degree so that is done of my goals.

I enjoy gardening and growing fruit trees and made apple, pear, and cranberry preserves last year.",1,1767283957.0,penpals,0,1.0,False

I asked about the teas and the girl just shrugged and said they were “black,” with zero attempt to check or help, like basic curiosity about the menu was an inconvenience. No warmth, no small talk, no “sorry about that,” just emotionally flat all around.

Most of the men there were big, serious, and unsmiling; one patron had a shirt with what looked like an AR-style rifle on it, and suddenly the whole room clicked into place for me as a very Christian-nationalist, militia-adjacent kind of space. That may not be their stated identity, but that’s absolutely how it felt sitting there.

1q17q2m,https://www.reddit.com/r/CATiim/comments/1q17q2m/the_compound_effect_how_small_daily_rituals_lead/,The Compound Effect: How Small Daily Rituals Lead to IIM Admissions.,"Preparing for the Common Admission Test (CAT) is less about a three-hour sprint and more about a year-long marathon. Because the syllabus is vast and the pressure is high, relying on ""motivation"" alone often leads to burnout.

The real secret to a 99+ percentile is habit development—turning cognitive heavy lifting into automatic routines.
Why Habits Trump Motivation

Motivation is a finite resource that fluctuates based on your mood or a bad mock score. Habits, however, reside in the basal ganglia of the brain, requiring almost zero willpower once established. 

                 For CAT aspirants, habits provide:

Consistency: You stop negotiating with yourself about whether to study.

Reduced Decision Fatigue: You don't ""decide"" what to do; you simply follow your system.

Compound Interest: Improving 1% in mental math every day leads to massive speed gains by November.

                   Core Habits for CAT Success

1. The ""Reading Hour"" Ritual

VARC (Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension) is often the make-or-break section. You cannot ""cram"" reading speed.
The Habit: Read for 45 minutes every morning before checking your phone.

The Source: Rotate between Aeon essays, The Hindu editorials, and international journals like The Economist.

The Goal: Build the stamina to read 500-word dense passages without losing focus.

2. The ""Daily 5"" Quant Maintenance

Quant proficiency is about pattern recognition. If you don't touch a topic for two weeks, your speed drops.

The Habit: Solve at least 5 Moderate-to-Difficult questions from a random topic every single day, even on ""off"" days.

The Goal: Keep the formulas and shortcuts fresh in your muscle memory.

3. Systematic Analysis (The Post-Mortem)

Most students focus on the score of a mock test. High achievers focus on the process.

The Habit: For every mock or sectional, spend 3x the time analyzing it.

The Process: Categorize every mistake into ""Silly Error,"" ""Conceptual Gap,"" or ""Time Management Issue.""

            How to Build These Habits (The ""Atomic"" Way)

To make these habits stick, use these three psychological triggers:

Habit Stacking: Tie a new habit to an existing one. ""After I pour my morning coffee, I will solve two DILR sets.""

The 2-Minute Rule: If a task feels daunting (like a 3-hour mock), commit to just 2 minutes of it. Once you start, the friction disappears.

Environment Design: Keep your CAT material open on your desk. Make the ""good"" habit the path of least resistance.
The Compounding Effect

If you solve just 3 DILR sets a day starting today, you will have tackled over 1,000 sets by exam day. That level of exposure makes you nearly ""unshockable"" when the actual paper arrives.

Note: Consistency is better than intensity. Studying 2 hours every day is significantly more effective for CAT than studying 14 hours only on Sundays.",0,1767283852.0,CATiim,0,0.5,False

1q17ogk,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1q17ogk/i_started_saying_hi_to_the_same_stranger_every/,"I started saying hi to the same stranger every morning, and it quietly rewired my whole year","When I moved to a new city I told everyone I was excited. New start, new routines, new me.

In reality I was doing this weird half life where youre technically surrounded by people all day but you still go days without anyone saying your name out loud.

My mornings were the same. Wake up, shower, throw on something acceptable, leave my apartment with that slightly stiff feeling like Im playing a person who has it together.

Downstairs theres a little bakery on the corner. I started going there because it was the closest place that smelled warm.

Id buy the same thing every time, mostly because decision making before 9am feels like a personal attack. A coffee and whatever pastry looked least likely to crumble on my shirt.

And every morning at the same time there was this older man sitting at the same table by the window. Always. Same corner seat, same newspaper folded into neat squares, same slow sip of tea like time had never yelled at him once.

At first I did what everyone does in a city, I pretended he wasnt there.

Then one morning I walked in and the barista was swamped and the line was long and I was already late, and I guess my face was doing that ""dont talk to me Im barely alive"" thing.

When I walked past his table the man looked up and just said very calmly,

""Good morning.""

Not in a weird way, just like I existed.

I surprised myself by answering. ""Morning.""

That was it, two words. But for some reason as I walked out I felt less invisible.

The next day I nodded first. ""Morning.""

He nodded back. ""Good morning.""

And then it became a thing. Not a friendship, not a conversation, just a small exchange that somehow kept me from going fully feral.

Some days it was only a nod. Some days hed add ""cold one today"" or ""you look tired"" like he was stating a fact not judging. And Id laugh a little and say yeah and keep moving.

It was so simple I didnt even realize it mattered until the morning it didnt happen.

I walked into the bakery and the corner table was empty. No newspaper, no tea, just sunlight on an empty chair.

I felt this stupid immediate disappointment like Id lost something I didnt have the right to miss.

I told myself not to be dramatic, people have lives, maybe he just came later or stopped coming or got sick.

I stood there way longer than normal pretending to look at pastries waiting to see if hed walk in. He didnt.

The next day same thing, empty chair. The next day again.

And now it was this tiny quiet worry I carried around all day even though it felt ridiculous to worry about a person whose last name I didnt know.

On the fourth day I finally asked the barista trying to sound casual.

""Hey um the guy who usually sits over there, by the window, is he okay?""

She blinked like she was deciding if I was safe then softened. ""Oh, Mr Lechner.""

So he had a name.

""He broke his hip, hes in the hospital. His daughter came in and told us. He was upset because he said he missed his morning routine.""

I dont know why but that hit me harder than it should have because I realized I wasnt the only one who needed that routine.

So that night I did something I normally would never do, I wrote a note. Not a big emotional note, just a small one on receipt paper because I didnt have anything else.

Hi Mr Lechner Its the girl who walks past your table every morning The bakery feels weird without you Hope youre healing fast See you at the window seat soon

Then I stared at it for ten minutes like it was a confession.

Next day I gave it to the barista and asked if she could give it to his daughter if she came in. I felt ridiculous the whole time, like who am I to send a note to a stranger?

Two days later I walked in and there was an envelope taped to the inside of the pastry case. My name wasnt on it because he didnt know it but the barista saw me and smiled like shed been waiting.

""Thats for you.""

Inside was a handwritten card, the kind old people still send.

Good morning Thank you for noticing when I wasnt there I didnt know your name so I asked. Its on the back of this card because my daughter said I should stop being stubborn You were part of my routine too See you soon

On the back in slightly shakier handwriting:

Your name?

I stood there holding that card and felt my eyes get hot immediately which was annoying because I had to go to work and pretend Im a functional adult.

So I grabbed a pen from the counter and wrote my name on the back. Then I added without thinking too hard:

Window seat is reserved. Dont argue.

A week later he came back. Walker instead of cane, newspaper still folded into neat squares.

He looked up when I walked in and smiled like wed been friends for years.

""Good morning.""

""Good morning.""

Same two words, same nothing conversation. But it didnt feel like nothing anymore.

Because the truth is I didnt move to a new city and instantly build a life, I built it the way you actually build things, one tiny repeated moment at a time.

And sometimes it starts with something as small as an empty chair and realizing youd miss it.",1,1767283733.0,story,0,1.0,False

I set the burrs to the flat 0 and going (I think) counterclockwise to increment the distance between them counting 60 clicks.

# Traits

1. Natural prose and dialogue: It doesn't have a very colorful writing style. It is written accessibly and typically avoids deepities that Qwen3 235B or Max delves into. 
2. Consistent writing: It doesn't lean into rhetorical flair and most paragraphs have comparable lengths. Each line typically has more than three words. 
3. Strolling pace: Especially when you instruct it to. It does it well and it typically fills the space with substance rather than extra detail. 
4. Positive bias: Role plays and stories written by it are, as I've found, lighter and less conspiratorial.

# Example

Prompt: Write a slow paced dialogue inspired by Hemingway. Scenario: Two acquaintances meeting again. They don't remember each other too well, because they met in high school long ago. 

Output: The coffee was black and bitter. Too bitter. But he drank it anyway because leaving it would mean something and he didn't want to mean anything.

""You look familiar,"" she said. Her hands were wrapped around her cup like she was trying to warm them.

He looked up from the window. Outside the snow was falling steady. ""Yeah?""

""We went to Central, didn't we? Senior year?""

""Maybe."" He didn't want to say yes if she was wrong. That would make things worse. ""What was your name again?""

""Sarah. Sarah Mitchell.""

He remembered now. The girl who sat behind him in chemistry. Who passed notes he never read. ""Right. Sarah.""

""You were on the track team.""

""Yeah.""

She waited for more but there wasn't any more. Just the coffee and the snow and the long time between then and now.

""What are you doing these days?"" she asked.

""Construction. You?""

""Accounting. For a small firm downtown.""

""That's good.""

""Yeah.""

The waitress came by and asked if they wanted more coffee. Sarah said no. He said yes but didn't really mean it.

""I heard you moved away after graduation,"" Sarah said.

""Florida. For a while. Then back here.""

""Did you like it there?""

""The weather was better.""

She smiled. It was a small smile but it was something. ""That's not really an answer.""

""No. I guess it's not.""

They sat quiet for a while. The coffee came and he stirred it even though it was too hot to drink.

""Remember Mrs. Patterson?"" Sarah asked.

""The chemistry teacher?""

""Yeah. She used to wear those bright scarves.""

""Every day.""

""She probably retired by now.""

""Probably.""

Sarah picked up her purse like she was going to leave. Then she put it back down.

""I should go,"" she said.

""Yeah.""

""But it was good seeing you. After all this time.""

""It was.""

She stood up. ""Take care of yourself.""

""You too.""

She walked to the door and he watched her go. The snow was deeper now and she had to walk slow. He finished his coffee. It was cold but he drank it anyway.

We’ve been together over five years and started dating at 16. He was my first love, my only relationship, and he’s genuinely the kindest, most loving person I’ve ever known. That’s what makes this so painful. I feel torn and confused about what’s normal and what isn’t.

I’ve brought up feeling disappointed that we don’t really go on dates or do much together, but we’re both broke college students. That said, he doesn’t have a job, and sometimes it feels like I put more effort into myself and the relationship than he does, but I definitely think he puts in more effort in other ways. I hate admitting this, but I’ve lost some physical attraction. He’s gained a lot of weight, is almost bald, and sometimes has bad breath, which makes intimacy and even conversation hard. I feel awful for caring about this, especially because he’s insecure and trying to fix it. I feel like the most vain person in the world because I know I would feel her if the same happened to me, but I do try my best to look my best as much as I can.

Sex has also been a huge issue. When we were sexually active, I constantly got UTIs and other symptoms, to the point where sex made me anxious. I eventually got off birth control because of side effects, and we haven’t had full sex in almost two years. I’m not withholding it on purpose, but I can’t relax because I’m always worried about what will happen afterward. I feel incredibly guilty about this. I don’t know if it’s because we’re sexually incompatible or it’s my own body fighting me?

Lately, I’ve found myself thinking about other people, imagining what it would be like to be with someone else. I know that sounds terrible. I don’t think I’d ever physically cheat, but it feels like I’ve mentally crossed lines. I’m meeting my professor for coffee, and the guilt is eating at me.

The hardest part is that no one has ever understood me like my boyfriend does. He listens, he cares deeply, and I know he loves me completely. I don’t doubt that I love him too, which is why this hurts so much. 

I’m not looking for sympathy. This is my first and only relationship, and I genuinely don’t know what feelings are normal, what’s inevitable over time, and what should be a sign to leave. I just want honest advice.

TLDR: I’ve been with my boyfriend since we were 16, and he’s genuinely kind, loyal, and willing to do anything for me. The problem is that I feel like I’ve changed. My attraction and comfort with intimacy have faded, and I feel guilty for wanting more and for thinking about what life might be like with other people. I love him and know he hasn’t done anything wrong, which makes it even harder to figure out whether these feelings are normal or a sign that I’m outgrowing my first relationship.",1,1767283235.0,relationships,2,1.0,False

it’s been going pretty good imo. she doesn’t nag, she doesn’t argue, she lets me pick where we eat and she’s always happy about it (not in the i’ll let you pick then ill bitch about it later way). shes a smokeshow, n really really soft spoken and gentle and feminine and all that shit. she’s the best ive ever had sex-wise, and that’s saying a lot considering  i have a lot to compare her to. she gives the most killer blowjobs you can imagine and her body’s insane. she cares about my interests and always gives me space when i want and takes care of me like im her baby (not even in an overbearing way). she shows me off to her friends and ive never once seen her eye another guy.  she communicates clearly and always apologizes when she’s wrong and she never creates shit out of nothing. shes affectionate and really lovey dovey and gives physical and verbal affection unprompted, which im not really used to. she’s funny and well liked and she’s wonderful to be around and i really do love her.

i’m naturally a really cynical guy and i tend to always think the worst of people who are practically perfect on the surface, but this isn’t even honeymoon period behavior because she’s like this to everyone, and shes never once shown any ‘true colors’ throughout the time we’ve been together.


i don’t know why, but something about how picture perfect fairy-taleish she is irks me really bad. i’ve tried explaining this shit to my friends before but they always say i’m just trynna find something to complain about but im really not. everytime i yell or something, she just looks sad and never yells back and tries to ‘calm me down’ like im some big bad guy, and it’s even worse when she cries or some shit. i admit i do have a bit of a temper but still.

i don’t wanna feel like im dating some fairy that i have to be as good to her as she is to me. it makes me feel like fucking shit. it’s like she’s putting this unspoken pressure on me to be this perfect boyfriend when i’m literally not capable of that and it pisses me off to no end. i know it sounds fucked but it’s really how i feel. i’ve been snapping at her a lot and ive been really passive aggressive when she’s honestly done nothing to deserve. i told one of my guys that im thinking of breaking up with her over it, and he told me id be a fucking dumbfuck to do that, but i don’t even know. 

i know she’d be really heartbroken if i broke up with her since i know she really really loves me but she’s honestly too much for me, but then again i feel like ill never find a girl as good as her ever again. what the fuck am i supposed to do here?

1q17f3p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1q17f3p/advice_on_roommate/,Advice on roommate,"Hi everyone,
It has been 3 years since I'm in the same room in the dorms...
So , first of all , I got a room in the dorms with 2 girls I knew from highschool ( they suggested being with them ) , it was very cool and all in the beginning until one of them started acting weirdly towards me , ignoring me , humiliating me in public and more ... They slowly left me behind and started hanging out together after we agree to hang out the 3 of us ... I distanced Ms from them bc that was the best I could do ... And once this same girl told me I'm a dumbass and I'm not supposed to be here ( we're both medical students and my scores are way higher than hers ) I told her to shut up ( I never objected B4 when she humiliates me ) and she exploded telling me curses and calling me names .... We didn't talk from that day and the two of them ignored my presence completely ... I thought that didn't bother me much ... Until I got sooo depressed ( bc of that girl and mom believed her every time she called telling her a lie about me ) I lost so much weight and nutrients , got treated after ... But the depression never went away...
I started having suicidal thoughts... And my grades went down ( not to the point where I don't pass ) I still passed that year ....
The year after we got a new girl in the room after the girl I didn't have a problem with left ...
We were good friends and I never thought about what's going to happen ... I always talk to her when I see her alone and we chat and laugh.... prepare teas for her when I do mine ... Give her snacks with me ... Answer her QSTs about studies if she asks .... Once when she got injured I helped her ... Once when she was sick and didn't show I asked her and stayed with her until she felt better ... Once she was crying about her grades I comforted her .... I took her to medical clubs with me .... And so much more....
Until one day she went to hang out with the other girl and came back 
she was sitting and suddenly exploded out of no where telling me I'm a piece of shit and selfish and I want to destroy people like I wanted to destroy that girl in the past , and I think I'm god and I come late to the room ( I study in a library in the dorms so I come late around 2 am but I do if opening the door putting my backpack on the ground and go to sleep immediately ) she said I always try to wake her when she's asleep by doing noise with the dishes on purpose and that when I open the door or close it , it wakes her up ... And that when I prepare coffee ( around 7 am or 8 am ) the sound of the coffee wake her up and that she hated me from the first time she saw me ( I'm not bad looking at all , most people tell me I'm pretty and although I hates to the infinity I still think I quite more beautiful than her so that wasn't the reason for her hating me on the first sight ) .... I , while she was screaming tried to calm her but there was no way , until she started shaking the bed and throwing things and the other girl closed the door so no one can come to rescue me... I got a panic attack and started crying then some girls came to the room and took me out ... I was crying telling them why I didn't do anything to her .... 
Days passed I tried to change the room but there was no way ... 
I went into the depressional state again and I became passively suicidal again, a lot of girls offered to help me then turned their back on me , other girls that were common friends btw us stopped talking to me or just ignore me if I talk to them .... I stopped eating and studying and praying and cleaning myself for a whole month until there was 1 month left for the exam, I tried to study the hardest I could and I kinda did good in it.... I got 86/100
I'm now on vacations and I need to go back to that terror again... My body shakes everytime I see them or think about them .... I get a sick feeling always... My family are very toxic and unsupportive, I don't have any friends and I can do nothing....
Pls for someone who got similar problems in the past , what shall I do .... I think about ending ml every now and then , my parents told me if I'm not strong enough to face reality then maybe I should really end ml .... I'm afraid of hell and of the pain .... 
Pls help me find a solution or at least a solution for my mental health 🙏

I'm looking for:
- A co-founder (technical, product, or growth-focused) and/or an early investor who's in it for the long game
- People who actually want to build, not just talk about it

- Strong background in business, product, and customer experience
- Clear thinking, structured execution, hands-on approach
- I'm focused on getting from idea → product → revenue, not theory

Here’s to trying new things!🥂 (I’m looking for 2-3 ladies between the ages 20-35 to write to.)

I like cats, coffee, and tea. I enjoy grandma hobbies such as baking, cross stitching, and crocheting. I also like painting, drawing or using my cricut. Anything artsy-fartsy is right up my alley. I like to do puzzles or pick out a coloring page and listen a podcast or some music. Right now my brain is really into indie pop rock like jungle, 21pilots, tame impala etc. Also books! 90% of last years reads were romantasy, 10% was contemp/rom/com. I like to go on walks or try new restaurants with my bf. Sushi makes me happy! Also noodles! 

That’s just a little about me, if you’re also into small crafts and lil diys, I’d love to have you as a pen pal. As part of swapping letters I’d like to eventually send each other small trinkets or things we’ve made that we think the other would find joy in. Maybe swap annotated books? 
I saw a post that they were swapping disposable cameras. I think taking pictures of mundane things in your life and swapping could be fun too. Maybe we can get to know each other and build up to that…?

1q179r8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1q179r8/aita_for_saying_i_wonder_if_ill_ever_find_someone/,AITA for saying I wonder if I’ll ever find someone who likes me the way I am?,"I’ve been married to my husband for 8 years, and we’ve been together for 10 in total. We have a daughter, and we’re both in our early-to-mid 30s (he’s about 5 years older). We met at a party in another state, discovered we lived in the same one, and it was an instant connection. We got married, had our daughter… but over time, the relationship became extremely heavy.



My husband is very explosive and verbally aggressive. He insults me frequently, calls me lazy, stupid, and worse. He yells at me constantly, including in front of our daughter. He is also verbally aggressive with his own mother, and on some occasions — more rarely — he has been verbally aggressive toward our daughter as well.



I come from a loving, stable family. I had access to good schools, courses, friends, and a strong support system. Lately, I’ve been questioning how I ended up here and how many opportunities in my own life I’m wasting trying to “hold together” someone else’s broken pieces.



He runs a tech company focused on the real estate market and works with a large construction company. Despite that, money is always tight. We also own a real estate business together, but I’m the only licensed agent. He rarely sells anything. There are months when only my commissions support our household.



On top of that, he expects me to take full responsibility for our daughter. All of her expenses — private school, doctors, medication, clothes, and leisure — are paid by me, with help from my parents. I also handle all the logistics: taking her to school, picking her up, her routine, everything. He doesn’t help. I wake up two hours earlier than him every day to get our daughter ready and take her to school while he keeps sleeping.



Even so, he expects the house to be clean and organized, dinner ready when he gets home (even though we often arrive at the same time), clothes washed, folded, and put away. If anything isn’t done the way he wants, he yells. If he wakes up and there’s no coffee ready, he yells.



For years, he’s said he’s going to “revolutionize the market,” but it hasn’t happened. Still, he blames me for not having the success he believes he should have. He says I’m a burden, that he can’t move forward because of me, and that I don’t want anything out of life. In December, for example, I made sales that guaranteed us three comfortable months financially — and that is completely ignored.



I admit I’m not the best housekeeper. I’m naturally disorganized, though I’ve improved a lot. Still, I’m completely exhausted and depressed. Life feels gray and drained of color.



Now here’s where I might be the asshole:

Last night, before midnight, he started another argument, saying I’m lazy, that he hasn’t succeeded because of me, that he needs a “driven woman” in order to succeed, and that he’ll be successful despite me. I know a lot of this is projection of his own frustration, but hearing this over and over is draining.



In the middle of all that, overwhelmed and exhausted, I said:

“I wonder if one day I’ll find someone who likes me the way I am, because I can’t take this anymore.”



He completely lost it. He accused me of trying to “jump ship,” said he always knew I was weak and a coward.



But the truth is, I’m just deeply tired — and starting to wonder whether staying means giving up on myself.



So, AITA for saying that?

I'm 22F and work in a coffee shop, it's a small business with 15 or so employees. I am clumsy so I drop and break cups/glasses etc frequently. I also tend to seem 'spacey' to other people, it's not that I'm not concentrating but when somebody explains something I sometimes need them to repeat what they said or walk me through it a different way. No one at work knows about my potential dyspraxia.

My coworkers bring up the fact I'm clumsy every single shift. Most of the time it's not in a nasty way, but it is constant. Even if someone else breaks something, my coworkers will say 'you're acting like X' or 'wow, someone other than X this time!"" I get laughed for seeming 'clueless' or for not understanding jokes. I've tried take it in my stride but it hurts. Me and 3 other coworkers were in the car driving home when one of them said ""Well, X, we all know you struggle with understanding and retaining information."" I said that was a mean thing to say and another person backed me up, but he just said, ""Well, it's true!"" That made me feel so insecure and sad. I'm nice to everybody at work. It's also little things, like I like cute things and I have a hello kitty phone case and a pink jacket I wear to work, and my coworkers make constant comments on them being 'weird'.

The worst is the assistant manager. She really dislikes me. Even when I'm not working she still complains about me. For example I'm scared of spiders and when we had a large spider decoration over Halloween, I would ask my someone else to move it away from the till. No big deal, but it turns out she'd complained to others working there that I was 'making it up' (I wasn't) or that I'd 'sat next to it while eating my lunch no problem' (I didn't). She has got annoyed at me for not remembering the exact figure we made that day (I'd wrote it down on the banking sheet so it didn't matter, a coworker has just asked out of curiority), for asking if I could do a certain task for her (she got annoyed and said she knew how to do her job), for not understanding things, for spilling something, for saying 'sure' (she thought I was saying it like ""are you sure?"" questioning her authority), for asking if anyone wanted to take their lunch before me, for asking for help on something, so on and so forth. She has made me cry on multiple occasions, usually after work but once on shift when she yelled at me for not understanding her explanation and saying ""Oh my God, do you understand? No, clearly you don't."" I had to go out the back and cry, it was so embarrassing. I have countless times overheard her complaining about me, I walked in on her doing an impression of me, she mutters under her breath about me, made a face to another coworker when I walked into the room, etc. I have tried everything, I've tried being very nice to her, I've tried not speaking unless I'm spoken to, but she still acts like this with me.

I don't know what to do about it. I'd go to my boss or HR, but because this coworker's mother is very unwell at the minute (terminal cancer with only a few months left) it makes me hesitate. My friend who no longer works there also complained about her to the boss and got told to 'stop naming names'. At this point, at least 3 people have complained about her and she still acts like this. In front of the boss and other management she seems all nice, but when he's not around she calls him f\*ckface and is nasty about other people that work here. I don't want to quit because I need this job and it pays better than other jobs in the area. I'm also currently trying to find a career job and I'm doing volunteering on the side to get experience in my desired field.

I'd really like some advice on how to stop letting this affect my self esteem, my intelligence is my biggest insecurity so this is making me feel very down.

I don’t know if these feelings are normal?,"I(21f) feel like I don’t feel the same way toward my boyfriend (21m) anymore. We’ve been together over five years and started dating at 16. He was my first love, my only relationship, and he’s genuinely the kindest, most loving person I’ve ever known. That’s what makes this so painful. I feel torn and confused about what’s normal and what isn’t.

I’ve brought up feeling disappointed that we don’t really go on dates or do much together, but we’re both broke college students. That said, he doesn’t have a job, and sometimes it feels like I put more effort into myself and the relationship than he does, but I definitely think he puts in more effort in other ways. I hate admitting this, but I’ve lost some physical attraction. He’s gained a lot of weight, is almost bald, and sometimes has bad breath, which makes intimacy and even conversation hard. I feel awful for caring about this, especially because he’s insecure and trying to fix it. I feel like the most vain person in the world because I know I would feel her if the same happened to me, but I do try my best to look my best as much as I can.

Sex has also been a huge issue. When we were sexually active, I constantly got UTIs and other symptoms, to the point where sex made me anxious. I eventually got off birth control because of side effects, and we haven’t had full sex in almost two years. I’m not withholding it on purpose, but I can’t relax because I’m always worried about what will happen afterward. I feel incredibly guilty about this. I don’t know if it’s because we’re sexually incompatible or it’s my own body fighting me?

Lately, I’ve found myself thinking about other people, imagining what it would be like to be with someone else. I know that sounds terrible. I don’t think I’d ever physically cheat, but it feels like I’ve mentally crossed lines. I’m meeting my professor for coffee, and the guilt is eating at me.

The hardest part is that no one has ever understood me like my boyfriend does. He listens, he cares deeply, and I know he loves me completely. I don’t doubt that I love him too, which is why this hurts so much. 

I’m not looking for sympathy. This is my first and only relationship, and I genuinely don’t know what feelings are normal, what’s inevitable over time, and what should be a sign to leave. I just want honest advice.",1,1767282568.0,offmychest,3,1.0,False

This gods-blasted place didn’t even have a name. It was just another part of the endless wastes. The - mostly irradiated - scars left from the great wars.

Beneath a sky of sickly yellow clouds, the air reeked of rotten eggs and other things, best left unmentioned. The ground was nothing but dirt and sand, peppered with the ruins of the old world—massive structures poking out of the earth like the fingers of decrepit corpses.

A moth-eaten tent flap, wedged between rusted metal and piled sandstone, was shoved aside. A boy emerged. He had no name. People simply knew him as the Roach.

Why?

Because that’s essentially what he was. He lived in trash, ate what he could scavenge, and he just WOULD NOT DIE.

Pustules and scabs covered most, if not all, of his coffee-colored skin. His curly hair was a matted, twisted nest, knotted where it hadn’t fallen out entirely. His right leg was gone, lost years ago, when it turned into a tasty morsel for the pack of mutated dogs that got the jump on a child too distracted by hunger to pay attention. 

That alone should have been the end of him.

His remaining leg couldn’t even straighten properly anymore. The legacy of countless beatings, of bones broken again… and again… and again…

One of the boy's eyes was permanently squinted. The other? The other was wide awake. It shone with an intelligence that was unnatural here, in a place where numbness was the only salvation. Staying alive was the goal;anything else was a luxury.

Something else could be seen in those light-brown, almost amber eyes. There was steel in there. A defiance that seemed to  challenge the world itself. A flat rejection of the very idea of death.

That very look was what always got him into trouble.

The grown-ups hated it.

Here they were, struggling to eke out an existence in this rotten place; what right did this runt have to look at them with those eyes?

The wastes had a hierarchy. 
Like animals, the weak did not look the strong in the eye.

The Roach however, refused to bend.

He’d been thrown off cliffs. His water had been stolen. He’d eaten poisonous bugs out of sheer hunger. But he just WOULD NOT DIE.

He’d learned his lesson, though. That’s why he lived alone. There were some scattered communities in the wastes, but he avoided them. The people there shunned him, beat him, then threw him out anyway. 

He didn't have a mother. None that he knew of anyway. The old woman who’d raised him along with a dozen other children, had said that his mother died in childbirth. Even then, they’d barely fed him. He was ignored. But he survived. Because he was a roach.

No time for those memories.

Today was the day to check the white ship.

The wastes had plenty for those who knew how to look. The Roach had learned much from corrupted data banks and flickering holographic avatars. The Marauder,  also paid well for working Old World tech, and he’d become one of their favorite… trading partners.

The white ship was the most intact ruin he’d ever come across. A structure as large as a small mountain, or at least the part he could see above the rusty brown-red sand.

You’d think a prize like that would have been picked clean decades ago. However, he was confident that it hadn't. For one good reason.

The sand around it was not dry. Rivulets of what looked like pristine, clear water ran through the dust.

A lie.

A death sentence for fools.

That water was radioactive. It burned any flesh it touched, like acid. 

But for the creatures that lived here, it was life. A corrupted, almost demonic spring of life.

Bushes the color of charcoal dotted the large field. Not to forget the patches of equally black and oily moss that grew alongside the streams. Between them moved creatures that made even the marauders puke.

Sandworms longer than an entire caravan. Wolves that looked more like walking cancer. And then there were the ‘fish’. 

He’d heard of  creatures called fish in the archives. Some of the creatures looked like them, if you squinted, really, really hard. Their bodies had far too many legs, like scorpions, but they DID have the tails of fish—of that he was certain. He'd never seen any other creatures with tails like those.

The other predators gave the ‘fish’ a wide berth. The things moved slowly, mostly lying motionless. Anything that got too close discovered their sluggishness was nothing but a facade.

Mouths wide enough to swallow entire boulders whole, would unfurl from their grotesque bodies, swallowing prey whole before they could even blink. Nothing ever fought back once inside that tent-like mouth; the Roach had seen outlines of creatures simply standing inside there stoically… for hours… until they slowly dissolved into nothing.

He did NOT want to know how or why. BUT, it had given him his opportunity.

He’d learned to sneak up on the ‘fish’ as they ate. Only the weaker ones on the outskirts. They were like snakes while eating, blind to the world.

As they concentrated on their meal, he would scavenge the thick mucus that dripped from the pink, cloth-like lining of their mouths. He covered himself with it.

The potent aroma kept the larger predators at bay. The weaker ones he could simply hide from.






The prosthetic leg he’d built for himself clanked and groaned in protest, as he jumped from his boulder perch. 

The thing was a monstrosity of scrap—an ankle joint from some old vehicle, a foot slapped together from half rusted leaf springs. It creaked, cut his skin, and made his hips ache. None of that mattered though. 

The piece of junk was the only reason he could still move. Still survive. There was no one to save him here. This place was every rat—every roach—for himself.

Slathered from head to toe—the toes he still had—in slime and filth, he began his slow, painful shuffle across the open field toward the white ship.

He smelled like an “aroma’ -an unholy stench-, rich enough to make even sandworms lose their meals. How he could still breathe was a miracle in and of itself.

After an hour of sneaking past stragglers that somehow ignored the… aroma…of the ‘fish’ he finally reached the hull. 

It was unbelievable. 

It looked less like metal and more like bleached white bone. Unlike everything else in the wastes, it wasn’t covered in rust. It had holes in it… but otherwise… nothing. Nothing was bent, no cracks… nothing. It was almost as if the holes were always there.

It reminded the Roach of the camouflage that some nomads used. They made their camps look weak and destitute on purpose. Anyone who tried to raid them found the dirty tents hid more steel than an armory. Then quickly turn from predators to prey.

Mesmerized by the - almost- clean white frame of the thing, he hobbled on his now painful leg to the nearest isolated hole. 

Just to be sure, he took the time to pile pieces of sandstone  inside the entrance, sealing himself in. Finally, he was inside.

Darkness, broken by shafts of sickly light from other holes. And deeper inside, a single pinprick of blue light.

TREASURE!

It had to be. 
Only LED light was that blue. LED meant working tech.

The Roach limped and hobbled, shuffling towards the light. A dull, hollow echo marking his steps.

So close…

When he reached it, he almost couldn’t believe his eyes. 

It was a hologram projector. It looked almost new—sleek, no exposed wires. He bent down, his prosthesis scraping his knee, and snatched it up after a few choice curses.

He held it close to his face, admiring the intricate lines of text on its smooth surface, the—


The ground opened up and swallowed him.

Darkness followed. He was weightless as it sped upwards, marked only by small lights that twinkled as they rushed past.

Something sharp stabbed into his shoulder, snagging him trying to stop his downwards fall 

It failed 

He kept falling.

His head banged against the walls of the narrow space. Again. And again. And again.

It felt like that time he’d been caught sneaking into that gang’s food store. 

The groaning of his metal joint had alerted the guards. They had not hesitated in treating him to some  ‘tender love and care’. 

One of them had given particular care to his head and face.

That was when he’d earned the ‘gift’, that was his permanently squinted eye. 

That guy had hit the roach's head more times than he could remember with that metal pipe. The rust from it had painted his hair and mixed with his blood. 

The pipe played a stuttering beat on his skull until the world started to sing.

Just like it did now.

The ringing melodies switched sides in his head with every new blow. 

His nose seemed to clear, before smelling of that oh so rare taste of leaves.

The taste of rust once again filled his mouth.

Then came the butterflies, his stomach felt like it had come alive.

Finally, when he could no longer even remember how he'd ended up here, it stopped.

He crashed into something soft. Like a sand dune, but softer. Wetter.


Was that water? But how could there be so much, just lying around? Did the Old World truly have such miracles?

Despite the pain, the Roach smiled.

The thought of being INSIDE water was exhilarating.

The darkness took him as he fantasized of ruling the wastes as the water king.

1q17779,https://www.reddit.com/r/CShortDramas/comments/1q17779/where_logic_goes_to_die_supermarket_organs/,"Where Logic Goes to Die: Supermarket Organs, Ticket-Marriages, and the Holy Knife of Forgiveness","As a Chinese short drama fan, the first thing to admit honestly is this: logic and short drama are like exes who block each other on every platform but still insist they’re “good friends.” They simply do not exist in the same universe—especially in the universe where we sell human organs like beans in a grocery, marry strangers like buying movie tickets, and wait for eternity just so a cheating spouse can redeem themselves with the holy “knife of forgiveness” at the end.

Since tools aren’t available to pull in external references right now, this is a purely creative, satirical take based on the tropes you described.

# 1. Logic Has Left the Group Chat

In normal storytelling, logic asks polite, boring questions like:

* “Why would she do that?”
* “Is that even possible?”
* “Shouldn’t someone call the police?”

In short drama, logic is treated like an annoying relative at a wedding banquet: smiled at, seated far away, and never allowed to speak into the microphone.

 There is no time for cause-and-effect, but there is always time for:

* One slap
* One gasp
* One instant marriage
* One cheating revelation
* One tearful monologue with a knife

Logic: “But human emotion is complex—”  
Short drama: “Sorry, we only support fast shipment and emotional express delivery.”

# 2. The Organ Aisle: “Buy Two Kidneys, Get a Heart Half Off”

In the serious world, organ donation involves hospitals, ethics committees, legal forms, and long waiting lists.

In short drama world, you just turn left after the snacks.

There’s a supermarket with fluorescent lighting, and in between the potatoes and the onions:

* A pile of kidneys, stacked like broad beans.
* Livers lying next to the frozen dumplings.
* Hearts neatly wrapped in plastic, with a yellow sticker: “Broken once, 30% off.”

Shopper A: “Excuse me, which heart is better for a second marriage?”  
Clerk: “This one’s been cheated on but still forgives easily—very popular with mother-in-law viewers.”

The price tags don’t show weight, they show personality:

* “Heart 01: Naive, cries easily, always forgives.”
* “Heart 02: Cold on the outside, soft inside, perfect for domineering CEO arcs.”
* “Heart 03: Strong independent woman, may leave the show after episode 10, use with caution.”

Logic: “Is this legal?”  
Short drama: “Relax, we passed the censorship of audience tears.”

# 3. Marriage Counter at the Cinema: “Two Tickets and a Lifetime, Please”

In reality, people date, chat, eat together, meet parents, argue, make up, and then they *maybe* talk about marriage.

In short drama:

* Episode 1: Hero and heroine bump into each other and spill coffee.
* Minute 2: They are already shouting, “Do you know who I am?!”
* Minute 3: Contract marriage.

Marriage here is simpler than buying bubble tea. The civil affairs bureau moves into the cinema lobby:

“Welcome to the Marriage Ticket Counter. What would you like to watch, I mean, marry, today?”

Menu:

* “Overbearing President Husband – 90 Episodes – Guaranteed car accidents and hospital scenes”
* “Cold CEO x Poor but Kind Heroine – Includes amnesia package”
* “Marriage First, Love Later – Comes with free mother-in-law”

You don’t choose a person, you choose a genre.

Logic: “Shouldn’t they talk about values, plans, children?”  
Short drama: “No need. That’s what episode 28 is for, right before the miscarriage and the betrayal.”

# 4. Waiting for Eternity: “VIP Seat for Your Own Suffering”

Once the marriage ticket is printed, the real fun begins: waiting.

In normal life, if your partner cheats, you:

* Confront them.
* Break up, or try counseling.
* At least question your life choices.

In short drama, if your partner cheats, you:

* Don’t leave. That would be after 20 episodes.
* Don’t call the lawyer. That’s not romantic.
* Don’t move on. That reduces tear-production.

Instead, you wait. For eternity. Eternity here means: wait until the writer runs out of new ways to torture you.

You will:

* Cook soup for the cheating husband at 3 a.m.
* Comfort the cheating wife who is “just confused.”
* Raise kids who keep asking, “Why is there always a strange uncle/aunt in our house?”

Audience comments:

* “Sister, just leave!”
* “Stay, I want to see how she forgives him with a knife.”
* “I’ll only accept this if she wakes up as a CEO in the finale.”

Logic: “Why is staying in a toxic relationship called ‘deep love’?”  
Short drama: “Because if she leaves, how will we drag it to 60 episodes?”

# 5. Knife of Forgiveness: Limited-Time Emotional Promotion

Let’s come to the highlight: the Knife of Forgiveness.

In real life:

* Knives are used to cut vegetables.

In short drama:

* Knives are used to cut logic, dignity, and common sense into thin slices.

Final episode:

* The cheating spouse kneels on the floor.
* The lighting is perfect.
* The background music is stirring.
* The monologue includes childhood trauma, work pressure, and “I didn’t know what I was doing.”

Then the main character opens the drawer. Not to take out divorce papers, but a knife.

Audience holds breath: “Is it revenge time?”  
Writer: “Of course not. This is a *forgiveness knife.*”

The cheating spouse sobs, “I don’t deserve you!”  
The audience comments:

* “WOW, she’s so great and selfless!”
* “My queen of suffering!”
* “When is Season 2?”

Logic: “Wait, why is the injured person comforting the person who hurt them?”  


In this ecosystem:

* Knives redeem cheaters.
* Blood proves love.
* The more unreasonable it is, the more it trends.",1,1767282510.0,CShortDramas,0,1.0,False

It's no secret that over the years I've openly called for CA to give us an ExFor cookbook, and I've even made a call or two for a recipe list. Yet... nada... nothing... not even a schmaybe.

So I've finally decided to do something about this travesty.

In recognition of the possibly final main-line ExFor Book being released this month, my spouse and I resolved to cook our way through the ExForce books in 2026.

Well.. we're going to try.  In my most recent run through the series (I'm almost done with Task Force Hammer), I have been capturing and recording the food references in the series.

**So-far there are over 300 direct food references, and I didn't even include the Maverick's books.**

Some are described in great detail, some are vaguely referenced, and some will need to be inspired by the books and some adjustment may be needed.

For example.. Monkeys can not eat Metallic Helium 3. I'm not sure that I can stomach Ruhar ""Chicken Volvesta"" With peprmint and jalapeno sauce, and my doc probably doesn't recommend that I eat a whole jar of Fluff. Also ""French Vegetarian Something or Other"" is going to be open to interpretation.

We will not be trying Skipway Brand Premium Dark Roast Coffee, but I did already buy a can of British ""mushy peas"" for the ""British Highland Pub Cheeseburger with Stilton, Mushy Peas, and Marmite"" and we're looking forward to making ""Funky Joes.""

So.. for those who might be similarly inspired, Here's the first few meals from ""Columbus Day""

- Sleep has been better but not great, and this is likely due to alcohol consumption, so not seeing the full benefits yet
- I've found fasting until 1pm so much easier for some reason, which is strange given how coffee is usually used as a way to supress appetite. Maybe because I'm more hydrated/drinking more water?

Every year, Tomoko Kawashita’s family travels from Japan to Thailand to follow up on the progress of the investigation into her murder.

The police think the attacker was trying to rob her, and when she fought back, they beat her to death. They took off with her bag, which had her passport and digital camera inside.

The progress of the investigation was slow because there wasn’t much evidence left at the scene. The only clue was very little foreign tissue under her fingernails.

The investigation has continued for several years. Over 400 individuals from the area have undergone DNA testing, compared against the material found in the nail bed - but the perpetrator has yet to be identified.

The DSI is offering a two-million-baht reward for information about this individual. 

The man in question was described as a European, aged around 35-40 at the time (now estimated to be 53-58). He was wearing a black crew-neck T-shirt and black nylon shorts. His build was tall and slim, about 170-180 cm in height, with fair skin and an oval-shaped face. His hair was cut short in a uniform buzz cut, dark brown or black in color. His eyes were dark brown or black, with prominent cheekbones, black eyebrows, a high nose bridge, and a short black beard no longer than a fingertip. He had no visible tattoos or earrings. He spoke English with a French accent.

On November 25, 2007, between 7:00-8:00 a.m., he rented a blue-and-black Honda Click motorcycle from the Coffee Club shop in downtown Sukhothai to tour the old city. He left his passport as collateral, but the shop did not make a copy of the document.

It is believed he may have been traveling with or met a European woman thought to be his partner. She had distinctive features: wavy blonde hair reaching from shoulder to mid-back, worn loose, a white spaghetti-strap tank top, and a long flared skirt down to her ankles resembling yellow tie-dye fabric.

The man was thought to have stayed at either the Old City Guesthouse or Witoon Guesthouse on Jarodwithithong Road in the old town of Sukhothai. He was later believed to have left Sukhothai for Chiang Mai by bus on November 25 or 26, 2007.

DIS urges anyone with information about this man, or any details that may assist the investigation, to contact Mr. Suwapich Manopas, Director of the Investigation, who is heading the investigation team at 02-831-9888 ext. 50413 or via email at [chalermphon\_ma@dsi.go.th](mailto:chalermphon_ma@dsi.go.th) or [pind.wg.dsi@gmail.com](mailto:pind.wg.dsi@gmail.com).

Crossing remote Himalayan passes above 5,000 meters, walking through untouched valleys, and spending weeks far from roads and modern facilities, this trek is not for casual hikers. Over the years, many trekkers planning the Snowman Trek with **Himalayan Asia Treks** have asked similar questions. This FAQ guide answers those questions honestly, based on real on-ground experience in Bhutan.

Whether you are researching for Reddit, planning for 2026 or beyond, or comparing Snowman Trek operators, this article will help you understand what the **Bhutan Snowman Trek** truly involves.



# What is the Bhutan Snowman Trek?

The **Snowman Trek Bhutan** is a legendary high-altitude trekking route in northern Bhutan that crosses the **Lunana region** and several Himalayan mountain passes above 5,000 meters. The classic Snowman Trek itinerary usually takes **24 to 28 days**, though shorter variations exist.

What makes the Bhutan Snowman Trek unique is its combination of:

* Extreme altitude
* Long duration
* Remote wilderness
* Cultural isolation
* Unpredictable Himalayan weather

Unlike trekking in Nepal, there are no teahouses on the Snowman Trek. Everything is fully supported by pack animals, cooks, guides, and logistics organized by licensed Bhutan trekking companies like **Himalayan Asia Treks**.



# Why is the Bhutan Snowman Trek considered the hardest trek in the world?

The Snowman Trek is considered the hardest trek because of **altitude, remoteness, and duration combined**. Many treks may be higher or longer, but few combine all three at such an extreme level.

Key difficulties include:

* Crossing **11 high mountain passes**, most above 4,800 meters
* Walking for **25+ days** with no road access
* Rapid weather changes including snowstorms even in trekking season
* Limited evacuation options
* Mental challenge of isolation

Even experienced Everest Base Camp or Three Passes trekkers find the Bhutan Snowman Trek significantly more demanding.



# How fit do you need to be for the Bhutan Snowman Trek?

You must be **very fit**, both physically and mentally. The Snowman Trek is not recommended unless you already have:

* High-altitude trekking experience above 5,000m
* Multi-week trekking experience
* Strong cardiovascular endurance
* Ability to walk 6–8 hours daily for weeks

Training should begin **at least 6 months in advance**, focusing on endurance hiking, stair climbing, and backpack training. Himalayan Asia Treks always evaluates fitness honestly before accepting Snowman Trek bookings.



# What is the best time for the Bhutan Snowman Trek?

The **best time for the Bhutan Snowman Trek** is:

* **Late September to October**
* **Early to mid-October** is considered ideal

Spring (April–May) is possible but riskier due to snow blocking high passes. Autumn offers clearer skies, stable weather, and better pass conditions. Even during the best season, snowfall is always possible.

Because Bhutan limits trekking permits, planning the Snowman Trek **12–18 months in advance** is strongly recommended.



# How much does the Bhutan Snowman Trek cost?

The **Bhutan Snowman Trek cost** is higher than most treks due to logistics, duration, and Bhutan government regulations.

Typical Snowman Trek price includes:

* Bhutan visa and permits
* Daily government sustainable development fee (SDF)
* Licensed Snowman Trek guide
* Cook, helpers, and pack animals
* Camping equipment and meals
* All ground transportation
* Domestic flights if required

On average, Snowman Trek packages range from **USD 9,000 to USD 13,000 per person**, depending on group size and itinerary length. Himalayan Asia Treks focuses on transparent pricing with no hidden costs.



# Are permits required for the Bhutan Snowman Trek?

Yes. The Bhutan Snowman Trek requires:

* Bhutan tourist visa
* Special trekking permits
* Restricted area permits
* Government-approved trekking operator

Independent trekking is not allowed in Bhutan. All Snowman Trek arrangements must be handled through a licensed company like **Himalayan Asia Treks**, which works directly with Bhutanese authorities.



# What accommodation is used on the Snowman Trek?

Accommodation on the Snowman Trek is **fully camping-based**. There are no lodges or teahouses along most of the route.

You will stay in:

* High-quality mountain tents
* Dining tents
* Kitchen tents
* Toilet tents

Himalayan Asia Treks uses proper four-season tents and provides warm sleeping arrangements suitable for sub-zero temperatures.



# What kind of food is served during the Snowman Trek?

Despite the remoteness, food on the Bhutan Snowman Trek is surprisingly good when managed properly.

Meals usually include:

* Rice, pasta, potatoes, lentils
* Fresh vegetables carried by pack animals
* Eggs, soups, pancakes
* Tea, coffee, and snacks

Special dietary requirements (vegetarian, vegan) can be accommodated with advance notice. Nutrition is a critical part of Snowman Trek success.



# Is altitude sickness a serious risk on the Snowman Trek?

Yes. **Altitude sickness is one of the biggest risks** on the Bhutan Snowman Trek. The route involves repeated ascents and descents over very high passes with limited rest options.

Proper acclimatization, slow pacing, hydration, and experienced guides are essential. Himalayan Asia Treks closely monitors oxygen levels and health throughout the trek and plans conservative itineraries to reduce risk.



# How remote is the Bhutan Snowman Trek?

Extremely remote. Once you start the Snowman Trek, you may not see a road, vehicle, or town for **over three weeks**. Communication is limited, and evacuation can take days depending on weather.

This isolation is exactly what makes the Bhutan Snowman Trek special — and dangerous if poorly organized.



# Can beginners do the Bhutan Snowman Trek?

No. The Snowman Trek is **not suitable for beginners**. Even strong hikers without high-altitude experience struggle on this route.

Himalayan Asia Treks strongly advises:

* Prior completion of major treks (Everest Three Passes, Annapurna Circuit, Laya Gasa Trek, etc.)
* Honest self-assessment before committing



# Why choose Himalayan Asia Treks for the Bhutan Snowman Trek?

Himalayan Asia Treks specializes in **complex Himalayan expeditions** across Bhutan, Nepal, and Tibet. For the Snowman Trek, experience matters more than marketing.

Key reasons trekkers choose Himalayan Asia Treks:

* Real Snowman Trek planning experience
* Conservative, safety-focused itineraries
* Strong logistics and crew management
* Honest pre-trek consultation
* Clear communication throughout the process

The Snowman Trek is not about speed or luxury — it’s about survival, endurance, and respect for the mountains.



# Is the Bhutan Snowman Trek worth it?

For the right person, **yes — absolutely**. The Snowman Trek offers:

* Untouched Himalayan landscapes
* Rare insight into Bhutan’s remote culture
* True wilderness trekking
* A sense of achievement few treks can match

But it is not a bucket-list item to rush into. Proper planning, the right team, and a realistic mindset make all the difference.



# Final Thoughts on the Bhutan Snowman Trek FAQ

The **Bhutan Snowman Trek** is not just a trek — it’s an expedition. Reading FAQs is the first step, but real preparation goes far deeper. If you are serious about attempting this legendary route, work with an experienced operator like **Himalayan Asia Treks**, train properly, and respect the mountains.",1,1767281556.0,BhutanSnowmantrek,0,1.0,False

Also it helps me to healthier, whole foods because they taste so good after not eating 23 hours. 

But the holidays were hard because it got me eating carbs again and started that addiction cycle in me again. It’s been so hard to stop it after several family gatherings where I ate rich tasty foods. It’s like it tempted the part of my brain that allowed myself to binge eat and let it take control. And I know people say “it’s fine, just fast the next day” but for me that’s hard because I’m much hungrier being off the wagon. 

I’m thinking next year I might just stick to my omad through the holidays because it’s playing with fire. And maybe only healthy foods and if there aren’t any, just continue fasting. I’m tired of the pressure, it’s hard enough as it is. For me it’s like an alcoholic being in a bar. Very hard to stay on the wagon.

i had my flights and everything and i paid 800 euros for this place for 1 week. that was my budget for the accomodation and how can i make an extra 1000 something euro budget all of a sudden for accomodation? the guy completely ruined my trip. my boyfriend and i had to cancel the trip that was planned for our anniversary in netherlands. and I got the refund 3 weeks later.  i even argued with my boyfriend, i cried for hours and this caused conflict between us.

booking customer doesnt do sh1t

nobody does anything about these people

the host may cancel your booking whenever he wants even 1 day before just because he feels off about your requests.

i ended up going to germany and my boyfriend and i booked a hotel for 80 euros a night and that was amazing. daily cleaning, 35 m2 room with a balcony and everything modern

airbnb/ booking era finished.

hotels are much better and cheaper nowadays

and at least they do not humiliate you

Last week she asked if she could borrow my laptop for a couple days because hers died right before a big work deadline. I was hesitant because I use mine daily, but she offered to pay me $100 to rent it for the weekend and promised she’d only use it in the apartment. I agreed, backed everything up, and rearranged some of my own work around not having it.

The night before she was supposed to take it, she casually mentioned that she’d actually need to take it with her to a coffee shop and maybe to a friend’s place “to focus better.” I told her I wasn’t comfortable with that, since the agreement was that it stayed in the apartment.

She then said that if I didn’t trust her, maybe I shouldn’t be charging her at all and that it felt weird to pay $100 if I was “going to be strict.” She suggested $40 instead, since she’d “probably only use it a few hours a day anyway.”

At that point I told her I wasn’t comfortable lending it at all anymore and that she’d need to find another solution. She got upset, said I was leaving her in a bind, and told a mutual friend that I was being controlling and greedy over “just a laptop.”

The friend told me I should’ve just let her take it and not made a big deal out of it since roommates are supposed to help each other out.

From my perspective, the issue wasn’t the money - it was the fact that she changed the terms after I already agreed and tried to guilt me when I said no.

Hi everyone, and Happy New Year! I’d like to get some advice — maybe someone has been in a similar situation.

I’m currently using a 1Zpresso K-Ultra and a Breville Bambino. I’ve already done basically all the available upgrades to improve shot quality, and the only thing left to try is different baskets — I’ve ordered a Normcore high extraction basket.

I’ve been using this setup for about 2 years. My birthday is coming up this month, and I’d like to treat myself with an upgrade.

I usually drink 2–3 Americanos a day. I buy beans from a local roaster. For a long time, I preferred washed Ethiopian coffees. However, occasionally I bought beans from local supermarkets (Kicking Horse, Lavazza, Melitta). Most of the time they’re awful and stale, but a couple of times I got fresh bags, and I noticed something interesting: I actually started enjoying richer, more chocolatey coffees with a fuller body.

My “ideal” coffee is something Americano-sized in volume, but very intense — like the equivalent of 3–4 double espresso pulls (half joking, but I think you get what I mean: I’m chasing density and body).

I’ve been thinking a lot about what I actually want to improve.

Path 1 — Grinder upgrade first

Hand grinding 2–3 shots a day isn’t terrible, but I’d really like to automate the process. If I’m upgrading to an electric grinder, I feel that to get a noticeable jump, I’d want grind-by-weight.

Grinders I’m considering:

* Baratza Sette 270Wi (\~900 CAD) - questionable gearbox.
* Eureka Mignon Libra (\~1050 CAD)  
* Fiorenzato AllGround Sense (\~1450 CAD)  
* Eureka Atom W 65 (\~1850 CAD) - really like it, but it’s out of my budget  

My budget is around 1000 CAD. Not sure if stretching it further makes sense.

Path 2 — Stretch budget to \~2500 CAD and upgrade both grinder & machine

There are some interesting bundles at KitchenBarista, for example:

* Profitec Go + Eureka Mignon Specialita  

This would be a bigger jump overall, but also a much bigger spend.

Path 3 — DF64 Gen 2

Buy a DF64 Gen 2 (\~450 CAD), stop there for now, and take time to understand where I really want to go next — and whether I even want to. Potentially save up for a serious espresso machine upgrade in a few years: better temperature and pressure control, better UX, build quality, and aesthetics. I absolutely love the design of machines like ECM Classika or ECM Mechanika Heritage Edition.

The big question:

What would give the most dramatic jump in performance for my preferences?

I had my headphones around my neck and my tote bag on my shoulder and I guess from a distance I looked like I worked there.

Because this woman walks up to me in the blazer aisle and goes really quiet,

""Hi sorry, do you work here?""

I shouldve said no but my brain did that thing where it tries to be helpful before it tries to be honest so I just said,

""Uh what do you need?""

She exhales like shes been holding her breath for an hour.

""I have an interview tomorrow. I havent done one in years. I dont even know what Im supposed to look like anymore.""

She wasnt dramatic about it, just embarrassed. Like asking for help was the part that hurt.

So I said okay show me what youre considering.

She had three options. A blazer that swallowed her whole, a blouse that looked like it had survived a war, and a dress that was actually cute but she kept tugging at the sleeves like she didnt trust it.

We stood there for maybe fifteen minutes doing the worlds least official fashion consultation.

I asked where the interview was, what kind of role, what she wanted to feel like walking in.

She blinked. ""Like Im allowed to be there.""

That line hit me so hard I almost pretended my phone rang.

So I helped her build something simple. The dress, the blazer that fit her shoulders, shoes that didnt look like they hated her.

When she came out of the fitting room her posture changed first and then her face caught up. She looked at herself in the mirror and did this tiny smile like she surprised herself.

Then she turned to me. ""Thank you, seriously, you have no idea.""

And thats when she pointed at my tote bag. ""So do you get a discount?""

I laughed. ""I dont work here, Im just a woman with strong opinions about blazers apparently.""

Her whole face cracked open, she laughed so hard she had to cover her mouth.

She hugged me right there by the clearance rack. ""This is the nicest thing anyones done for me in a long time.""

I figured that was it, a sweet weird little moment.

Then last week happened.

Last week was one of those weeks where everything stacks. Alarm didnt go off, spilled coffee on my shirt, my boss hit me with a ""quick chat"" that was not quick.

By the time I got off the bus I was holding it together with pure spite and mascara.

I stop at the corner shop to buy bread and something unhealthy and Im standing in line staring at nothing trying not to cry in public.

And I hear this voice behind me.

""No way. Blazer Girl?""

I turn around. Its her.

Same eyes, same smile, different energy. She looks lighter, like shes not bracing for impact anymore.

I must have looked confused because she goes ""Thrift store, interview outfit, you told me the shoulders were the whole point?""

My brain went blank because I wasnt expecting to be remembered by anyone for anything.

""Oh my god yes, hi.""

Shes holding a basket with normal happy life things, fruit, tea, some fancy chocolate.

Then she looks at my face for two seconds and her smile softens.

""Bad day?""

I tried to do the automatic ""no Im fine"" but my voice did that thing where it betrays you so I just nodded.

She doesnt make it a big deal, just reaches into her basket, pulls out the chocolate bar and sets it on the conveyor belt with my stuff like its the most normal thing in the world.

""What are you doing?""

""Paying you back.""

I start to protest and she cuts me off gently. ""You dont get to argue. You helped me feel like I was allowed to be in the room remember?""

Then she leans in. ""I got the job.""

I felt my whole chest do this strange warm drop, like relief for someone else can still fix parts of you.

We walked out together and stood outside for a minute while cars went by.

She told me she still has the outfit, wore it to her first day, kept hearing my voice going ""shoulders, youve got this.""

Then she said something that made me laugh even though my eyes were still wet.

""Im not good at thanking people in a normal way so I made a rule.""

""What rule?""

""If I see someone on the edge of a bad day I do one small thing that makes it less sharp."" She waved the receipt. ""Today youre the small thing.""

We went our separate ways after that, no dramatic music, no movie ending. Just a stranger turning a terrible day into a survivable one.

And I know its cheesy but Ive been thinking about it ever since.

How you can walk into an ordinary place on an ordinary day and accidentally become part of someones story.

How sometimes you dont get a big sign that you mattered, sometimes you just get a chocolate bar on a conveyor belt and a quiet ""I got the job.""

By directing the liquid to different areas of the tongue, the cup subtly changes how flavors are perceived—without altering the brew itself.

The narrow rim channels the drink toward the front and center of the tongue, emphasizing sweetness, intensity, and a fuller body.

The flared rim opens the flow, spreading the liquid toward the back of the tongue. This enhances aroma, brings forward floral notes, and extends the finish with a lighter, silkier mouthfeel.

Two rim profiles. Two tasting experiences.

My Experience- 

At first glance, it felt like it might be a gimmick. But I was lucky enough to try it at a local café in Mumbai—and that completely changed my mind. Within the first two sips, it felt like I was drinking two entirely different coffees. I absolutely loved it.
I was genuinely blown away by the idea and the level of innovation happening in the coffee world right now.

You are standing at a crossroads right now.

Metal. Ceramic. **Self-Ligating**. **Invisalign**.

They all promise the same destination (straight teeth), but the vehicle you take to get there matters. A lot.

Most people choose based on a fantasy version of themselves. The version that has unlimited patience, perfect discipline, and never drinks coffee.

**Stop doing that.**

If you are hunting for an orthodontist in South Florida (Miramar, Pembroke Pines, Weston, etc.), you need to choose for your *actual* life. Not the marketing brochure life.

Here is the raw, no-fluff breakdown of what you are actually signing up for.

***

## 1. Metal Braces: The ""Ugly"" Workhorse
Let’s start with the classic.

**Why they rule:** They work. If your bite is a disaster or your teeth need massive movement, metal is the heavy artillery.

**The Lie:** ""I can’t smile in photos.""
**The Truth:** You get over it in 3 weeks. Seriously. Nobody cares.

**The Lifestyle Hit:**
*   Popcorn is your enemy.
*   Apples must be sliced.
*   Flossing becomes a tactical operation (get a water flosser).

**The Wallet:** Typically the **most affordable** option ($3k-$7k). If you are budget-conscious, this is your play.

***

## 2. Ceramic Braces: The ""Sneaky"" Middle Ground
They are metal braces, but tooth-colored. That’s it.

**The Good:**
*   Same power as metal.
*   Way less visible (great for client-facing jobs).
*   Cost sits right between Metal and Invisalign.

**The Bad:**
*   **They stain.** If you smash curry, red wine, or coffee daily, your brackets will look dingy.
*   They are more fragile than metal.

***

## 3. Self-Ligating Braces: The Efficiency Hack
These use a sliding door mechanism instead of those little rubber bands to hold the wire.

**Why you should care:**
*   **Less Friction = Less Pain.**
*   **Speed.** Some cases finish months faster.
*   **Hygiene.** No rubber bands means less gunk gets trapped.

It costs a bit more, but if you value your time and comfort, the ROI is there.

***

## 4. Clear Aligners / Invisalign: The double-edged sword
Everyone wants these. Not everyone *should* have them.

**The Fantasy:** Invisible! Eat whatever I want! Easy!

**The Reality:**
> You have to wear them 22 hours a day.

That leaves you 2 hours to eat, drink coffee, brush, and floss.

*   Are you disciplined? **You win.**
*   Are you forgetful? **You lose.**

If you take them out and forget to put them back in, your teeth don't move. You waste money. You extend treatment time.

**The Tech:**
If you go this route, make sure you get a scan first. [Clear aligner treatment plans at SMILE-FX](https://smile-fx.com/clear-aligners/) start with a 3D scan so you see the end result before you spend a dime. No surprises.

***

## The ""Real Life"" Checklist (How to actually decide)

Don't ask ""what is best?"" Ask ""who am I?""

*   **You play contact sports?** Get Braces. Taking aligners out constantly is a nightmare.
*   **You are in sales/media?** Get [Invisalign](https://smile-fx.com/why-smile-fx/) or Ceramic. Aesthetics convert.
*   **You are lazy/forgetful?** Get Metal Braces. Once they are glued on, you can't mess it up. ""Set it and forget it.""
*   **You are on a tight budget?** Metal is king.

***

## The Cost Breakdown (Estimates)

*   **Metal:** $3,000 - $7,000
*   **Ceramic:** $4,000 - $8,000
*   **Invisalign:** $4,000 - $8,000

*Note: Insurance is tricky. Some cover metal fully but only cover a % of Invisalign. Check your policy.*

***

## Next Steps

Don’t guess. Get a scan.

The best orthodontists won't push the most expensive option; they will push the one that fits your psychology.

If you are in Broward or Miami-Dade (Davie, Hollywood, Silverlakes area), stop Doom-scrolling and go get real data.

*   **Action:** [Book a FREE 3D scan and VIP consultation here](https://smile-fx.com/lp/free-consult).
*   **Why:** You get to see the timeline and cost upfront.

the problem: i was spending 2-3 hours in canva every time just fighting with layouts. change one line of text and suddenly everything shifts. logo gets covered, spacing breaks, have to redo the whole thing.

realized i was doing the same layout work over and over. same structure, just different text and colors.

tried a few approaches:

* saving canva templates (still broke when editing)
* duplicating old files (version control nightmare)
* screenshot + manual recreation (tedious)

what finally worked: found tools that support uploading a reference image and extracting the layout structure. you give it your own content and it arranges everything the same way.

took a poster i liked from pinterest, uploaded it as reference, added my coffee shop info. first try the spacing was off but second attempt nailed it.

the difference is obvious:

* old canva version: text overlapping logo, inconsistent spacing, had to manually adjust every element
* new workflow: clean layout, everything aligned, just swap content and it holds together

now when i need to update ""holiday blend"" to ""new year roast"" the layout holds. no more fighting with text boxes.

first time took 10 minutes instead of 2 hours. now i can batch 3-4 promos in one sitting.

You could almost hear a pin drop, with how tense and silent the room was.

*Feronia stared at the hulk of shadow before her, suffocating the air with mass and presence alike. Compound eyes traced those sharp segments from where they sprouted out, like particularly long thorns on branches, all the way to the sharp edges gripping the carpet. Light reflected off of the black, revealing the glint of twitching pincers and the delicate web patterning stitched upon his finery. Waves of power weaved around him, through every limb and every strand of fur. It exuded dread by simply being. Demanded attention in a way that felt inevitable. A question awaiting a fact. Not a suggestion. Not an order.*

*Acantho stared at the odd fae. It was quite blue, he faintly realized. Slender, surely, but filled up nicely enough to warrant it as a decent filling should it chooses to be.*

Puck clapped his hands together, the sound as loud as a thunderclap that tore through the brittle silence as if it were fine silk. “Okay! Since this is the first time that we’re all meeting together like this, let’s take it easy, alright? No pressure, just some light conversation… and maybe refreshments. Tea?”

Acantho shook his head, content to watch in mild fascination as the fae lunged for its cup, almost as if afraid the drink would run off. Clutched so tightly it was a wonder the glass didn’t crack, the tea was promptly inhaled in one big gulp, leaving the being to sip air before the realization registered in its mind. The blue deepened to a vibrant purple and the empty cup was thrown onto the table none-too-gently.

Even the human winced at the motion.

“… I’ll pour you another cup but, Feronia, please have mercy on my limited supply of tea packets. There’s only so much I can scrounge from the community resource pool before the others start coming at me with pitchforks and torches the second we end up facing tea famine.”

Feronia was trying.

No, really, she was!

But those eyes. Those sharp claws.

The dizzying feeling that came whenever her magic ventured too far. She had gotten reckless. Had let her instincts guide her instead of her head, let her mana pulse towards something that was firmly off limits.

She was rewarded with a searing pain that nearly ripped the outer edges of her soul. Her magic recoiled, mournful whines echoing through her head as invisible chains tightened further into her being, punishing her for the audacity. The shame of simply daring to stand too close to her master. It threatened to swallow her whole, molding her into nothing but a disgusting gooey puddle of regret and misery.

She took a deep breath and willed her mana back, not letting even a single wave of power wander too close to the danger zone. She’d gotten far too lax during her supposed freedom, letting the magic swirl around with wild abandon. And it had nearly caused her a decade off of her life, topped with a very unpleasant migraine.

Restrain the magic, keep it contained, and do not even think about *prying* into the Arachnids’ personal spaces. These were the rules she had abided by all her life, and she could very well obey them for far longer. She could get through this. Ignore the looming threat. Banish the being out of sight and out of mind.

Focus on the reason she was here in the first place.

Said reason was busy setting up another cup of tea and an assortment of goods she had yet to see before. Things like what looked to be bread in all sorts of interesting shapes, tiny little cakes, even some weird flake-like things and a myriad of others too strange for her to name.

Despite their rather unimpressive appearance, it was more than made up for by the tantalizing alien smells that wafted only in the way freshly baked goods could. Thrums of mana took the form of swirling waves, gently drifting around the treats, almost smug in their confidence that temptation would surely win over even the harshest of critics.

In a show of grace (and definitely not eagerness), Feronia reached for one of the little cake-like treats, a darling little delicacy topped with white cream and fine brown specks scattered all over. She saw Acantho reach over as well, large paws gripping tight on a small shred of… some kind of meat? Either way, he eyed up the food in that creepy way Arachnids tended to do when their vision was trained on a singular prey, before relenting and tossing the stuff into his waiting maw. She caught the brief shudder of his limbs, a slight tremble of his fangs as he nearly convulsed, almost as if his soul had outright rejected the meal.

Then, that quick flash was gone. And all that remained was a slightly displeased Arachnid sucking up the liquefied meat in a pained pout before he downed it with another very short-lived tremor.

That was concerning.

Still, Feronia found herself rather indifferent. If the Arachnid wanted to hide his suffering, then it was hardly her responsibility to shed light on it.

Her time was better spent focusing on much more pleasant things. Like the still-warm treat cupped carefully in the palms of her hands. Something rich and warm ascended upwards, the scent reminding her almost of cozy evenings spent in the comfort of good company. It wasn’t overpowering, but it was unabashed in its strength, unashamed in its aroma, and entirely inviting in the way the invisible fumes seemed to draw her forward as if they were imbued with a hypnotizing charm.

Would the humans do such a thing? Waste an enchantment on such a fleeting item?

Did Feronia care?

Not really, she realized. Regardless of whether the humans wasted their time on seemingly meaningless endeavors or not, her perception of them remained unchanged. They were crazy, peculiar, and even horrifying simply in just how they chose to live. She had been quite taken with them, yes. But even she could agree that some of their decisions were… questionable, at least from what little context she had. Yes, they were powerful beings with unimaginable potential at their fingertips.

And they spent a good chunk of that potential arguing about whether a tomato was a fruit or a vegetable. In fact, their little campfire discussions had even driven a few fae nearby into a confusing spiral of their own, and she was quite sure she saw some familiar faces drifting in the wind, murmuring reverently about the effects of ‘dark matter’ or something of the sort.

That was to say, she knew more than most, with how much she found herself listening closer to their conversations even as she hesitated to reveal herself. And she knew the humans were an insane species reminiscent of a fever dream cooked up by the universe.

But they were daring, charming, and, dare she say, inspiring in the values they breathed life into and the convictions they held with so much belief it felt like truth. And curse it all, she had thrown her lot in with these folks, and she’d very well stick by them until the day the last drop of mana drained out of her soul.

With a certainty that felt like a taste of pure ambrosia, she bit into the moist cloud-like texture, the explosion of flavors bursting on her tongue as if it were the final affirmation of her choice. Sweet bitterness coated her tongue, with hints of creamy goodness, melting as easily as fog caught in sunlight. It held all the durability of a cloud, softer than any tangible thing had any right to be. The tiny specks provided a sharp undertone to the spongy goodness, making it certain that, yes, she was indeed eating something, and *not* dreaming of it.

A sigh of delight escaped her closed lips, a pleased ‘*mmm’* reverberating softly, but apparently loud enough for the others to hear.

Puck’s grin stretched from ear to ear, and Acantho looked slightly scandalized at such a bold display of emotion from a fae.

Both reactions felt equally satisfying.

“What is it?” She asked after swallowing the first bite, leaving a pleasant, tingly aftertaste in its wake.

“T̶͔͆̎̆i̸̼͇̠̿r̵̲͗̂ȁ̵͖̮m̷̡͉̦͋̉̿i̸̭̒s̷͈̣̮̍ù̴̧̥͇̞!” An enthusiastic wave of hands. “A classic dessert of a certain group of people with rather *strong* opinions on food. Infused with ladyfingers, ě̴̹̫͖̽̈́s̷̼̅p̷͕͉̌r̴͍̍͑̍ḛ̶̽̒̒s̷̈ͅs̸̢̮̱̏ǫ̴̡͖͆̀ coffee, m̸̮͐̊à̴̰̙̒ș̸̒̑c̷̛̲a̴͚͔͆̇r̴̗̼̒͝p̷͕̻̀̓̉o̸̢͒̄ń̸̪͜ė̴̜̲͜ cheese and just a bit of cocoa! Honestly, a universal cultural staple at this point.”

Oh.

Ouch.

Feronia grimaced at the multiple tiny fizzes of magic that burst like particularly miserable lanterns. There were a lot of errors for what was supposed to be an answer to a simple question. Just how many types of food-related names did the humans have to come up with anyway? Looking around at the unusual spread before her, a sinking feeling told her that their culinary dictionary might just be a tad more expansive than the average realm.

“A Tee- Tiara- Teera-”

“Tiramisu.”

“Tee Ra Mehsu.”

A smile softening with something dangerously fond graced his lips. “Close enough.”

And, by the realms, did everything feel worth it again. If keeping her magic constrained was the prize to pay for little moments like this, she would do it in a heartbeat, over and over again.

Which also meant that moment had to shatter almost instantly, and by the only unsavory part of this whole exchange.

“Ladyfingers? I thought you humans hated that sort of thing.” A small huff that sounded suspiciously like a muffled scoff. “Unless this just so happens to suit *your* definition of ‘consensual’.” His pincers clicked like nails grating on metal. “Your food tastes terrible, by the way.”

Puck furrowed his brow, inclining his head towards the Arachnid for a precious few moments before chuckling lightly. There was no hint of offense at the blatant insult, not even the tiniest expression of hurt or rage. Only a cheerful laughter usually reserved for loose night outs with friends, not in the charged atmosphere of a diplomatic meeting. “No, that’s just a name. Ladyfingers are a type of biscuits, called so for their shape.” He held out a hand and twiddled his own fingers merrily. “The real ones, of course, are definitely not available for consumption.”

A low rumble came from the Arachnid, though whether it was out of humor or just plain irritation remained unclear, even to Acantho himself.

“And I suppose you aren’t a big fan of beef jerky then.” The human barrelled on, cheer undiminished and tone as cordial as ever. “That’s alright, we have plenty more options you could try out. In fact…” He took ahold of a bowl, eyes gleaming with something unspoken. “Here, this might be more to your taste.” The human pushed forward one of the stranger dishes of the lot, a soup that looked and smelt like a typical broth would, except for the copious amount of white stuff bobbing within.

Acantho took the bowl hesitantly, feeling rather pensive after that first unpleasant experience. He inwardly shuddered once more at the thought, of that awfully stringy meat struggling to go all the way in. It had gotten stuck, not because his body couldn’t take it, no. It was like his *magic* itself was refusing the satisfaction, getting a taste and screaming that this was not what it wanted. Not only was it of lesser breed, the remains of an animal too stupid and weak, it was not quite… real.

It looked like meat. Tasted like meat. But it wasn’t actual meat, only the illusion of it. As if the humans had breathed life into something dead, only to not commit halfway through. The result – an eerie product somewhere in between, breaching the line between alive and dead. Reality and not.

And that was one sin too many for his magic to tolerate.

It took everything within his power to keep the mush down, and much more to let nothing more than a faint grimace show. But even such a tiny show of emotion was caught by the human, face creasing in sympathy but not bringing attention to it. Because, of course, it- *he* just had to show off more of that magnanimous generosity. As if the sight of Acantho fumbling an apology just a few days earlier was more than enough ammunition to continue his little friendship mission.

Stupid diplomats. Stupid training and their stupid apparently inherent compassion.

But even as his claws tightened around the bowl, hard enough to cause webs of cracks to form, he caught that encouraging smile. That infuriating gentleness painfully screaming through those eyes. He had been too preoccupied with the masks before, never noticing the small tells that would have helped paint a fuller picture. The way his body leaned forward just slightly, the way his mouth smiled a little too tightly, the way his hands remained loose, as if in preparation for Acantho’s refusal, to take the bowl back should he decline.

He had immediately noticed his usual insect mush suffocating amongst all those other fancy dishes, the silent care striking harder through his core than the sharpest blade. That nameless human had been right. The empathy was visible, maybe since that very first night. Despite possessing sharper sight than most, he had ironically been too *blinded* by his own paranoia to see what had always been there.

“… If you’re not comfortable eating, you’re allowed to refuse. I’m not going to hold it against you for having preferences. Maybe you can give me a list of food you like next time. Uh, preferably excluding sapient options, of course.” The human had started rambling, one foot tapping the ground in a clear display of anxiety.

He must still be tense from their earlier confrontation, one that had not gone quite the way either of them expected.

*“Uh, about earlier…” Great Mother, he already hated this.*

*He had only gotten a few words out, having caught the human in their usual meeting room, looking uncommonly forlorn. Sure, he had been given the day off, but the stranger’s words lingered in his mind. That blunt truth a terrible medicine he’d never known he needed.*

*And despite not quite understanding what had exactly transpired, his feet had carried him automatically to their usual haunt, mind fogged with the ghost of an apology.*

*An apology that was not coming out. What was he even supposed to say?*

*“Hey, I’m sorry for trying to eat a fae. I’ll make sure to get full consent from an eligible adult next time.”*

*That, he felt with his track record, would not go over well.*

*But his mind wouldn’t rest, couldn’t let him rest. He had stewed all night long about the possibility of hope, toyed with the idea of a different life. Perhaps, one spent learning in the company of the weirdest realm he’d ever encountered.*

*He didn’t mind the thought, to his surprise. Had even found himself feverishly excited, in a way he had never allowed himself to be. For once, the spotlight did not feel blinding, overwhelming.*

*It felt like it didn’t exist at all.*

*But he could only grasp that future if he’d started mending the ties he’d ripped away. Soothed the wounds he had thrown salt into. Rinse, restart, retry.*

*And so he was here.*

*Failing miserably.*

*“I am.” He paused. The human was looking at him now. It was sitting, but he felt smaller, like he could be squashed at any moment. “Look, I am.” His limbs started fidgeting. “That day. What I did.” Breathe in, breathe out. “Was not very cool, I feel.” Keep going, keep going. “So, I.” Come on. “Would like to.” Just one more, one more word. “Apologize.”*

*The tension seeped out of his frame, surprising even him at how colossal the relief felt. He’d gotten it out, attempted something he’d never imagined doing in a million lifetimes. And he’d made it. Getting that small word out felt like he’d just breached an invisible barrier that had always hindered him.*

*He felt fantastic!*

*The human blinked, slow, methodical. Like it was still processing the words spoken a good few seconds ago. Then, with one long brush of lashes against skin, it stood up. Shakily. Hunched slightly. Even the calm serenity that always pervaded around it looked off. Frantic, in a way. The waves of color remained the same as it always had, cheery, peaceful. Just more…*

*Tumultuous. Like waves crashing at sandy shores.*

*Hardly dangerous at the best of times. But harsh all the same.*

*“You... you’re apologizing.” Its voice was calm and polished. But not quite normal. Stiff, in a way. Or perhaps, hoarse. From speaking words it wasn’t quite sure would be accepted.*

*Acantho nodded.*

*“Why?”*

*Rat droppings. It required more??*

*“You know.”*

*“Know what?”*

*A silent scream echoed through his mind. “For my behavior.” His limbs were starting to feel like goo. He feared he may topple at any moment and hastily sat down on his chair before the embarrassment could overwhelm him. “I was not aware of your… cultural sensitivities. And spoke rashly without thorough consideration.” His head hung low, eyes firmly trained on the warped reflection of his visage in the sleek, white floor. “I will strive to avoid these mistakes in the future.”*

*The quiet stretched between them, pulled to its limits by the heaviness lingering after such words, occasionally disturbed by the random bursts of thoughts and waves flowing around him. He had maintained a certain level of vigilant power so that his aura wouldn’t fluctuate so much, but had let it go after some thought. The human wouldn’t see it anyway, so why waste energy on something so pointless?*

*The being in question was still motionless, limbs locked in place as if cursed by an invisible spell. Its aura, too, had quietened, crashing waves soothed into submission, or perhaps suspicion. A politician placated by pleasantries or a warrior poised to strike?*

*Then, it moved. Slowly. Negligibly. A slight twitch of the eye. A tap of finger against air.*

*Next, a sigh. A long one, filled with something much too old for a realm so new. “I see.” There was something darkly ironic about such an expression coming from a magically-blind species. “Then, it’s my turn. Acantho of House Silk, I humbly apologize on behalf of humanity, but also in light of my treatment of you and, by extension, your realm.”*

*It was Acantho’s time to blink, eight unsynchronized blackberries looking rather silly with how they squinted at the being in front of them. He did get out of bed this morning, didn’t he? If this was all some weird dream made up by his straining brain, he really would work himself into a frenzy for the second – third? – time in a row.*

*“For what exactly?”*

*It inhaled. Exhaled. He should try that sometimes. “For everything. Since we intruded upon this realm and your family.” Its hands held tight together, knuckles paling at the harsh grip. “We had unfairly crossed your boundaries and breached the rights you have as sapient, sentient beings, thereby robbing you of your freedom of choice and being guilty of the same crime I had held you accountable for. We may… abhor your rules of society and the general values you hold as a species, but I understand that this does not give us the right to impose onto you with our own.”*

*A pause. Acantho’s thoughts stuttered. His mind wandered back to the stranger of that night. He didn’t lie. His hatred had been obvious, palpable, and true. But he had also believed that others wouldn’t lie as well. The other that was sitting in front of him. Apologizing. For just playing their part in the Dance. Both from the same species. Holding vastly different opinions.*

*One, hatred tempered by societal restraint.*

*Another, compassion hardened with… something.*

*His gaze met the other. Piercing black poring into brown. Like the night sky trying to cement the shadows into the earth itself. When he spoke, his voice was remarkably even, surprising himself with how he managed to keep the words steady.*

*“If you had the chance to change the past, would you do things differently?” His claws clenched into his paw, sharp edges digging into the pads. “Or would you do things the exact same way? Would we end up back here as we are now?”*

*The human fidgeted uncomfortably, that mask of a smile threatening to fall apart at any moment. “I- Well, I wouldn’t say exactly, but-”*

*“Would you still ‘cross our boundaries’? Would you still ‘breach our rights’?” Blood seeped out of his pads, a blue sheen painted upon his nails. “Would you still ‘rob us of our choice’?”*

*A pause.*

*Its aura grew more frantic, its movement halted like a deer in shock.*

*A second passed, maybe two, as anxious eyes kept their gaze upon Acantho, the only real feature of that still-smiling, still-frozen painted mask.*

*Another second.*

*And then –*

*It finally slumped, a full-blown frown marring that carefully sculpted face, a feature that felt wrong. As if something pure had just been tainted, the innocence of a child ruined by cruel reality. Or maybe it had always been, the corruption buried deeply inside the grown man coming out only when the cracks had been made wide enough. An ugly manifestation of the truest part of the soul coming to life now that it had been pushed to the brink.*

*He looked a little more like that stranger now.*

*“Yeah.” The confession was painful, wrung out of gritted teeth and a swollen heart. But at least Acantho now knew that lies were never what he needed to worry about. “Yeah, I suppose… we still would, wouldn’t we? It’s-” He bit back a groan. “It’s complicated.”*

*A beat. The blood dried to dusty flakes. “Out of all the paths you could have chosen, why choose this one?”*

*He closed his eyes, as if to gather thoughts gone unheard. “It was a big thing. Astronomically huge, really. Everyone had a say in it. There were votes, campaigns, debates, fights – lots of fights – all to decide what kind of neighbor we would be to all the realms.” Hands dug into knees, almost to anchor himself for the next few words. “This path was the one that seemed to fit our values, our goals, and our convictions the most.” A moment. “And the one that had the least violence, the least bloodshed involved.”*

*Silence draped upon them, familiar now. Like a blanket to huddle their thoughts closer together. Acantho’s voice was low, tinged with something that veered between a threat and a warning. “This balance between peace and subterfuge. You chose the most difficult path to tread.”*

*“We would have never been satisfied with less.”*

*They stared at each other, both too tired to put up any facade.*

*Then, a chuckle.*

*Acantho’s eyes widened, surprised at what had just come out of his mouth. Then, another chuckle, and another, until it turned into a full-blown unapologetic series of laughs, one that strained his throat, borne out of a mind that had long forgotten the meaning of a dull existence. “If this was the path of least violence, I hardly dare to imagine what the other options were!” This was clumsily said through peals of laughter, the Arachnid no longer caring about how coherent he sounded.*

*“Tell me, do you ever intend to say all this in the beginning? Or were you going to keep us in the dark forever? Oh, who am I kidding? Of course, you didn’t! Wow, this must have really weighed on your mind a lot for you to just come out with all this.” He choked on his own mirth, devolving into a coughing fit before he calmed himself down, although a few weak giggles slipped past his guard all the same.*

*Great Mother, Puck looked dreadfully uncomfortable. It would almost be delicious if the situation wasn’t so absurdly hilarious. “No, that’s not true at all! We have every intention of coming clean with you… even if not now.”*

*“Oh?” A mocking hissed accompanied his words. “And when will that grand reveal be? What wonderful acts have your realm scripted to give this show a jaw-dropping finish? Go on, don’t be shy.”*

*“I-” He massaged his temple in frustration. A click of the tongue made to calm the nerves. “We will. I swear on the honor and integrity of my people, of humanity as a whole. We will not leave out a single detail. We’ll even put it all in fine print if you request it. When all is said and done, and when every secret has come to light… When you’re ready.”*

*“When I’m ready…” Acantho tested the foreign words. “That feels arbitrary – convenient.”*

*And when he saw the human open his mouth to argue once more, to continue this cycle of back and forth with no end in finish, he raised a limb to gesture silence and continued. “Don’t get me wrong. This is not me trying to pick faults with you. In fact-” He inclined his head in an imitation of a bow. “I – very begrudgingly – respect your kind’s determination to stick to your script. Not everyone has the same admirable dedication as you do. And, because of that, I am honored to have such a talented partner to share the Dance with. If anything, you make things more entertaining. And that-”*

*He paused for dramatic effect. “Is, as Professor Ridae has taught me once, the true spirit of the Eternal Dance.”*

*His frankly remarkable speech he’d made up at the last minute was not met with roaring applause or overwhelming enthusiasm as he would have liked. Instead of even deigning it with even a little polite acknowledgment, the human only continued to stare, face blank in a way that did not feel intentional. It felt more like his face had gotten stuck, like the shock had stunned him entirely and rendered him incapable of any other expressions.*

*When he finally spoke, it was a quiet murmur, one Acantho wasn’t quite sure he was meant to hear.*

*“When you’re ready…”*

Honestly, humans. Dramatic freaks. (Acantho pushed down that one traitorous feeling that had the shape of something resembling gratitude.)

 “We did prepare your usual, in case you didn’t find anything new you like. Here, I’ll hand it over to you-”

“No, thanks.” Acantho answered stiffly. “I’m good.”

And to prove it, he took a deep breath, letting the aroma curl in his lungs. It smelt like flowers, like a dish powdered with additions upon additions, as if ashamed of its original scent. And yet, something intriguing broke through all that cloying fragrance anyway. Something sour. Something sharp. Like the remnants of the dead.

He took a cautious sip, all too disinclined to repeat the same embarrassing full-body charade he had performed the first time around. The first drop gave an interesting preview of what was to come, sour, creamy and nutty all at once. He could sense his magic poking the strange intruder before quickly losing interest. It seemed this was safe to consume for now.

He swirled the spoon, feeling the liquid flow gently along his machinations, disrupting leafy greens, red tomatoes and that interesting white stuff all at once. A brief moment of curiosity led him to scoop up the egg-shaped beans, fleetingly eyeing the way they bobbed and wobbled before chucking the contents into his jaw. Mouth sealed shut, he braced for the inevitable pushback, the nausea that would spring into being just as suddenly as it would disappear. He could feel his stomach roiling within, an unpleasant vibration sending a chill spreading through his entire being.

Then, with hardly any fanfare, the discomfort subsided, and the meal slid in. Acantho breathed a little easier, finally being able to focus on what he had just eaten instead of bracing in anticipation of the consequences. The beans were juicy and had a pleasant milky aftertaste. But what was most striking was how soft they felt, breaking easily with the slightest brush against his throat. In fact, they were extremely delicate, only in the way newborns could be…

Oh.

He stilled. Then, he took a closer look at the white beans. His first assumption was correct. They really did look like eggs – Perhaps because they were. As soon as the thought entered his mind, that same uneasy feeling from the meat crawled up his throat.

“What- What is it?”

Puck gave him a sheepish grin, the comical sight breaking Acantho out of his spiraling thoughts for one temporary gratifying moment. “I would like to apologize in advance for my subpar pronunciation. Admittedly, this isn’t one of my more fluent languages and there are a bunch of different regional variations, but I’ll go with the simplest - G̸͕͛͝a̸̡̓ȩ̵̞́n̵̗͂g̸̗͛̅͜ ̵̯͓̽͐K̵̪̜͂̂a̸̤̍̚i̵͇͘ ̵͖͘M̵͉̟̀ô̸̦t̸̛̤͖͐ ̸̫̉D̸̩̜͂̽a̷̡̧̓ę̷͍̅n̵͕̠͑̚g̶̼͋͝.”

Acantho flinched. “Gan Kai- Kai Mot Dang- Den? Deng, no Dan-”

“It’s fine if you don’t get the name right the first time. Would be a miracle if you did, considering it took me many many months just to start getting the hang of it. I can only dream of sounding like a native several years into the future, so just relax and say it however well you can.” He paused for a second before letting a troublemaker’s grin adorn his face. “Or you can say it with the literal translation: ant egg soup!”

Ah, of course.

That made sense, even as he idly wondered where the humans found the time to go digging around for the ingredients needed to complete all these elaborate dishes. Although – did they even concern themselves with dirt and grime? Despite having seen them get down and dirty way out in the open doing various things that Acantho was not culturally competent enough to understand, the not-quite-meat and the not-quite-eggs left a strange taste to ponder over.

“It’s… adequate,” he muttered softly, even as his core still roared faintly with unsatiated hunger. “I’ve seen better, but it’s… fine.”

But before the human could interject with a comment of his own, a smaller, more unexpected voice broke the lingering quiet. “If you found it simply adequate…” It was hushed, barely audible. “Then why bother limiting yourself all the same?”

He stared at the fae, caught off guard by the sudden question. Not for the eccentricity of the question itself – it must have known the sour implications of the word in the Arachnids’ dictionary of compliments – but rather because of the source.

For a moment, he just found himself staring at the curious specimen, wondering what else it could attempt to chime in with, or at least something that could be comprehensible to it.  The silence grew as he only continued to stare, the other two occupants of the room starting to look vaguely uncomfortable at the extended silence.

It took an awkward chuckle from Puck to break the impromptu staring contest before he went on to address the fae, “I imagine he must have wanted to try something new and refrained from his usual fare to entertain my pestering.” He inclined his head towards the Arachnid in question. “I’m only sorry you haven’t yet managed to find something truly delightful, considering the cultural importance you place upon the culinary arts. I do hope you would give more of our dishes a try. There are so many, I’m sure you’ll find something you like eventually.”

Acantho opened his mouth to issue a curt reply when, once again – “That’s not what I meant.”

Wow, the fae was unusually talkative. Was it an unexpected consequence of prolonged contact with humans? Fae very rarely did deign to converse after all, and when they do, *it’s always the mad ones.*

“Oh, can you clarify, Feronia? I don’t think either of us quite understood.”

The blatant attempt at playing peacemaker by the human did not dissuade the tension rising once more, that familiar apprehension appearing from the very first second of their meeting. Except now, it seemed intent on growing and growing and, with the way the fae’s antennae twitched ever so slightly, it was about to reach a boiling point.

“The Arachnids do not limit themselves to foods of inferior tastes.” The voice was calm as it usually was with this species, sing-song in the way only the fae could achieve. “They have a more refined palate with specific dietary requirements.” Its head tilted down, shoulders hunching so far it was more akin to a weirdly elongated ball than a being. “I only ask because these requirements have always needed to be met, even on long diplomatic trips to the other realms, whether by the host’s kind offerings or carrying enough storage to last. So, has Master Acantho truly decided to abandon the fae delicacy altogether?”

His paws clenched. How dare this – What – The nerve to – He wasn’t even aware the fae could think that thoroughly. But a warning look on Puck’s face tempered his mounting anger, enough for a displeased series of clicking to be the sole sign of his displeasure. While the prospect of giving up his main food source was purely unthinkable, he hardly believed that the humans would be all too lenient if they knew his unchanged convictions. So, with an annoyed sigh, “I shall not be indulging in those sorts of habits on the surface of this realm for the foreseeable future.”

It held its tiny head up, eyes bulging from where they sat in the sockets. “So, you intend to continue once you have returned to your home realm?”

“I hardly presume that’s appropriate for a lesser being to know.”

“Stop.”

The word instantly dried up any more back-and-forths that had just started its momentum, halting the conflict before it could begin. Puck was rubbing his temple, lips a small thin line. He muttered something quietly before looking up at Acantho, eyes fogged with weary resignation. “Feronia is not lesser to you. And I would prefer you do not refer to her in such a manner.”

“But it is.” “But I am though.”

Puck swiveled his head around in a scandalized sort of surprise, disbelief clinging to every feature of that unmasked face as he eyed the fae. “You- what?”

It smiled, soft and sweet, the kind that could charm the skin off your bones before you knew it. “I appreciate everything your realm – and you – have done for me. Truly. But even you can’t rewrite facts into make-believe a child can change on a whim.” It rose up, imperfect wings fluttering behind as it hovered near the human. “You are the most wonderful peoples I have ever known in all my years of living. But I have long made peace with certain facts of life.”

Puck stared at it. “You are not lesser, Feronia.”

It smiled again, adoration apparent in every inch of that blue skin as those eyes never left the – Oh Great Mother, it had imprinted on the human – “Maybe not tomorrow, if your promises are to be believed. But yesterday, I was. And today, I am.”

Its delicate fingers latched onto his shoulders. “Your belief means all the world to me. And I trust that your realm is one to make such lofty promises and mean them. But regardless of what happens in the future, nothing will change how I had lived in the past.”

This touching (ugh) little confession was followed by a stilted hush. The human only continued to stare, as if every word he would have said had been stolen away by the breeze created through every flap of wing. The fae froze for a moment, before fluttering back down to its seat, an anxious sort of frown enveloping its face.

And whilst Acantho was enjoying being the quiet observer for once, Puck glanced back at him and, once again, the spotlight cast its glaring light upon him. “And you? Why do you believe the fae to be lesser to you?”

He shrugged, every limb swaying with each shake he made so that he more resembled a disgruntled dandelion caught in the wind rather than the unaffected sapient he wanted to come across as. “They lost, fair and square. Winners, takers.” He toyed with the claws of one of his paws. “I know you humans find such a concept difficult to understand, but it’s a cultural thing. Kind of a big deal in the universe.”

Brown eyes traced the shine of those claws when they caught the arresting white light from above. “And do you naturally consider any losing side to be lesser, even if it’s the loss from a past era, fought between your ancestors rather than yourselves?”

“Yes. That’s about right.” “Of course, my ancestors and I are hardly different.”

Puck pursed his lips, a thoughtful frown overtaking all other features. His aura, usually as light and pleasant as a fluffy cloud, rolled around discontentedly as if promising thunder on the horizon. While he took his time sorting through complicated thoughts Acantho could only imagine, the two kept their silence, refusing to engage with one another. The fae was even pointedly staring at the human rather than letting its eyes stray for even a second in the Arachnid’s direction. Which, after all that yapping it had performed, he suspected was intentional.

Then, a clap.

Both figures’ attention was drawn immediately to their smiling counterpart, a rare spark illuminating within those eyes. He brought his hands together for another clap, the sound as loud as thunder as it paved the atmosphere for his next declaration. “Well, this has been one enlightening meeting, but I have just thought of a lovely idea for where we could have our next one.”

Acantho tilted his head to the side. “But we have always had our meetings in this room.”

He waved a hand flippantly. “And I say, it’s high time for a change of scenery, no? I have just the perfect place in mind.”

Feronia leaned forward, eyes eager with anticipation. “What is it, Puck?”

“We’re going to pay a visit to Titania and her new adopted son!”

1q165a7,https://www.reddit.com/r/StrangerThings/comments/1q165a7/i_loved_this_show_from_the_beginningbut_finale/,I loved this show from the beginning...but (Finale Thoughts),"I need to utter the disclaimer again that I am such a fan of the show. This show means a lot to me to me personally outside of it being a great show that I have followed since it first came out. 

I found myself sitting in silence after the finale and dealing with the reality that it just didn't hit the way I was expecting. I was expecting to be a crying mess, but before I knew it the battle was over and I was left seeing the book close on my favorite characters and learning about what they were doing almost 2 years later. 

Expectations are just that. They are generally meaningless, and often our fault. I had high expectations for the finale due to how Vol 2 played out. In a sense, that's unfair, but at the same time I felt like we were sold high expectations for Vol 2 and the finale that just didn't match the hype from the creators (ex. ""dark Christmas). 

I never in a million years would have thought that season 5 would start by breaking the internet with it's vol 1 finale, then a month later experience a fall from grace so bad that fans went viral believing there was a better written/edited version that we didn't get to see. 

Coming into a finale like that sucked.

I'm happy for the fans that love it. I truly am and there are parts worth loving.

Part of me wants to watch it again, another part of me is questioning if I can. Another part of me is like chill bro its a TV show, lol. 

I have a love for this show that I'm not sure I will ever have for another due to some personal ties. It also made me appreciate how good we had it as I recapped finales of past and the excitement, awe, gut-punches, and mystery this show nailed season after season. We were spoiled. 

**Thank you Stranger Things for spoiling us.** 

..... 

**Extras if you read this far:**

If you care, some of you might be wondering ""what didn't you like?"" and ""why did you dislike vol 2 so much?"" 

**First off, I really enjoyed parts of the finale and I thought this season had incredible episodes and some of the best scenes ever in the show.** I want to start there because this doesn't need to be a negative pounding on the finale, because there were some truly great moments.

1. Joyce getting the final blow 2. Hoppers scene with Vecna  3. The Montauk reference got me. 4. The final scene opening with the sprinkler and them playing DND (exact to season 1). 4. Later realizing Dustin's speech was exactly what Eddie wanted to do. 5. That whole basement scene with the books and the passing of the torch. 6. That shot of El and the mind-flyer. 👏

**What I didn't like** 

**Finale**

1. The final battle felt far too fast. Elle seemed to have no issue vs. previous encounters. 2. Zero casualties for characters that mattered (no offense to Kali, no one was emotionally tied to her). We had this every season. A gut-punch that created stans for Bob, Barb, Eddie, etc. This time they came out unscathed, and the one that went ""missing"" was by choice. It was just a little too good to be true for a show that often delivered such real emotional blows. 3. How are there no demos in Henry's world when we saw them there in season 4? They were such a central part to the show and the lack of them in the world they came from was a bit odd, but maybe I missed something. They certainly would have raised the stakes if they were there. 4. It was nice to wrap up everyones story, but dedicating half the episode to it felt like a lot. It was more for the fans and for that it's fine, but for the story it didn't add any impact. TLDR: The battle felt fast and any friction or intensity was quickly overcome then boom, it's graduation. 

**Episode 7**

I think the criticism of Episode 7 is warranted. I get that people have taken political or lifestyle positions on it, but the episode was executed in a way that many fans assumed a better version had been written or even filmed. Even if you liked it, that alone says there’s a problem. I personally felt they dragged Will's personal narrative out. I feel like his acceptance of himself in the finale of Vol 1 *could not be beat* and to continue it the way they did felt forced and oddly timed. Will went from hero in an internet breaking episode to a flurry of joke memes and the lowest rated episode. Add that with that, the rest of the episode being built up with planning, Mike somehow building a bomb, and then we are left waiting a week to continue following that truck into the upside down just felt lifeless. The outlier was the opening of the episode, Lucas and Max and Steve and Dustin's moment. Amazing.  

**When it comes to season 5 two things can be true, a show can be worth criticizing and our expectations can damper things we love.** 

**I don't want this to be entirely negative. I'm going to consider this my morning for coffee and contemplation as I unpacked my thoughts. Not everything is perfect and recapping the show as a whole reminds me how damn good it was most of the time.** ",6,1767279733.0,StrangerThings,7,0.8,False
1q1657q,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q1657q,Any kid “coin hounds” out there? (Coin roll hunting / metal detecting / collecting),"Hey y’all — I’m in the Mooresville / Lake Norman area and trying to connect my kid with other kids who are into coins.

He’s a legit coin hound: loves checking change, coin roll hunting (pennies/nickels/dimes/quarters), and learning the fun stuff like wheat pennies, silver finds, errors, and cool foreign coins. We’re also open to metal detecting (parks/fields with permission), coin shows, or just meeting up at a library/community spot to trade doubles and compare finds.

Looking for:

	•	Other kids (and families) in/around Mooresville, Davidson, Cornelius, Huntersville, Statesville, Troutman, Charlotte north side

	•	Parents who’d be down for a casual “coin kids” meetup

	•	Tips on any local coin clubs, kid-friendly coin shops, or coin shows nearby

What I’m NOT trying to do: anything weird or random. Parents stay involved, public meetup only, and we can keep it simple (library table, coffee shop, etc.). If enough people reply, I’m happy to set up a small group meetup.

If your kid is into coin collecting, drop a comment or DM:

	•	age range (rough is fine)

	•	what they like (coin rolls, collecting albums, metal detecting, trading)

	•	best days/times for a public meetup

I’ve been working on this project for months, and **my first app is finally live on the Play Store!**

I built **SnapFit** because I was tired of manually searching and typing food logs in other apps. I also hated how expensive subscription prices have become for basic health tools. I wanted something faster, cleaner, and much more affordable.

**What it does:**

* **AI Scanning:** You just take a photo of your food, and it uses AI to estimate calories and macros instantly.
* **Affordable Pricing:** Unlike the big apps that charge $20/month, I created a **Monthly Package** that is super cheap (less than a coffee) because health shouldn't break the bank.
* **Clean UI:** Minimalist macro rings, dark mode support, and no ""social feed"" clutter.

Since this is my first release, I would love to hear your feedback on the UI and features.

After being in therapy, there were lots of realizations that made me feel unsafe around him. To sweeten the deal I had since had two autistic children who I would do anything to protect. I started seeing him cross my boundaries when it came to how I parented, I could no longer leave the kids alone with him because he would disregard everything I asked him to do. I tried multiple times to educate him on ASD and their support needs that would provide the most accessibility but he had to do it his way every time.

November 2024, he went on a campaign spouting RFKs insane rhetoric about autistic folks and a shit ton of other political garbage that isn’t worth rehashing but that was my breaking point. We had a conversation post-election and I told him I needed space from him and we would not be coming around anymore. That Christmas he dropped gifts and desserts at my door which has had me on edge ever since. Last year he had people reach out on his behalf asking to let him see the kids to which I declined….as the requests continued though, I began to just ignore them all together. 

Woke up this morning to the following message from him on Facebook (he deleted his account at one point before I could block) 

“Good morning...Happy New Year. As the clock turns over, I feel like it would be a good time to sit and talk for a few. Maybe clear the air. I don't want to just stop by your house unless that is the only option. I miss you. We miss you, and recognize that there is much to come together on. Maybe start via the phone, or a cup of coffee. Hope you guys are doing well!”

I so badly want to respond back: “the fact that you are threatening to violate my space if you don’t get what you want tells me all I need to know. Go fuck yourself” BUT there’s another part of me that knows he wants to get a rise out of me.

1q161jh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1q161jh/am_i_overreacting_by_my_expectations_of_my/,Am I overreacting by my expectations of my partner now that im pregnant?,"Hi everyone.

For a bit of background im (33f) currently 22 weeks pregnant with our first child and it hasnt been an easy road to get here. We spent a few years battling infertility, then ivf, surgery and finally have been lucky enough to conceive our little baby.

My partner is m32. Through our relationship theres been things ive been irked about and have brought up - mostly due to his hyper fixation on things causing him to be irresponsible and a bit selfish with his priorities. He has said things will change when baby is here (we've been trying for 4 years) and explained he wanted to be selfish and enjoy life before I got pregnant- I got it. 

The issue is now im pregnant he has went back on his promises and hasnt changed at all. 

1. Hes a big gamer. During the weekends he can easily game for up to 13 or 14 hours solid leaving no time for helping around the house and no time for me. He promised he would start reducing the gaming time - this hasnt happened. He also has a gaming room in the house that I want to turn into the nursery. This hasnt happened yet either. We will be moving house soon and his only priority is to have a 'gaming room' in the next house - despite me wanting any spare space to be a play room for the baby or a home office (i work from home). He says im being unfair, not supportive of his hobby whereas im at my wits end and would rather the entire gaming room went because im tired of him shutting himself in there and never helping out or seeing him for days on end. 

2. A few years ago he bought a motorbike on a whim despite my concern for our finances (I thought our priority should be saving for the baby/ a new home) and his safety. We compromised by saying he would sell the bike when I got pregnant. He has since went back on his word and thinks he will have days away biking when I give birth (leaving me to look after the newborn alone). On top of the hours he thinks he will have to game in a gaming room. Selling that bike would substantially help us pay for baby things and things for a new home, but he said if he sells the bike he will regret it and 'resent me' and he should be able to have days away to 'destress' when the baby comes. 

3. Among all of his time consuming hobbies, a big issue is how much he is prioritising me at the minute. His friends have very little boundaries and little respect for me. Ive asked him to prioritise me/our growing family above his friends and he insists he does this, however over the xmas period I asked him could we have a date night - he said he was too busy working late to 'save for the baby' but then took a night off work to go to the bar with his friends. A few days later I asked could we go for coffee to get out of the house, he said he was exhausted and didnt want to leave the house, then his friend called and asked him to help collect some furniture and he hopped straight up and went out leaving me alone. Just yesterday I pointed out we had spent no time together and could we go for lunch, he said of course but then his friend pulled into our drive and they both disappeared into his gaming room to 'fix an issue with the PlayStation'. He tells me 'you want me to save for a house and baby stuff so im exhausted working myself to the bone, i dont have the energy to plan dates' then follows up by sitting on a mic gaming with his friends until 4am (he seems to have plenty of energy to do this).

4. We both work full time, although his job is more manual than mine. Until now I have been happy to do 100% of the cooking and house admin (meal plans, bills paid on time, finances sorted, groceries, dog food, appointments etc) and our household chores have always been 50/50 which i have been happy with. Recently ive been exhausted and hes been slacking, id say im currently doing 70% of the housework, all of the house admin and all of the cooking. Ive raised this with him and he shoots back that his job is more manual so hes more exhausted than I am, and needs more time to de stress, which usually means getting home from work, putting his feet up and gaming, while i finish work and get straight into cooking our dinner and cleaning up. 

This guy says he wants this baby more than anything. When I try talking about issues and how I need him to become more responsible and supportive its just ending up in shouting arguements and tears. He said im being unreasonable and im 'stressing him' because im hormonal and pissed at him all the time. Hes using this as an excuse why hes not prioritising me and needs more time with his friends and gaming to 'destress' from having to live with me at the moment. He said im being too demanding and trying to take away everything he enjoys. 

On the flipside I feel like the past few years have been hell, with ivf, surgery, now pregnancy doing a number on me. Im emotionally and physically exhausted and I just want him to look after me or support me for once. I dont feel like im being unreasonable not wanting a gaming room anymore, wanting him to uphold his promise of selling the bike so we have more money for a nice home for the baby, and not spending the majority of his time and effort on his friends, rather focusing on our growing family. 

Am I being unreasonable? Is this relationship doomed? I feel like an idiot trusting him when he said things will change when I get pregnant.

You spend weeks optimizing a Facebook pixel for zero traffic and tweaking a logo nobody has seen. The honest truth is that getting initial traction has nothing to do with algorithms and everything to do with brute force.

I’ve seen this play out a thousand times: The founders who win early are the ones willing to do things that simply don't scale. Based on the feedback from the community, here is how you actually get the ball rolling without spending a dime.

# 1. The ""Shameless Plug"" Method

We tend to hide our businesses because we are afraid of being ""that guy,"" but you have to get over it. One founder here admitted they started by ""telling literally everyone"" they knew—coworkers, family, even random people at coffee shops.

It feels awkward, but it works. The goal isn't just to sell to your mom; it's to trigger the snowball effect. As that same founder noted, ""one satisfied customer told 3 people"" and the growth compounded from there. Your personal network is your seed audience.

# 2. Mine Your ""Past Life"" (The Rolodex Strategy)

If you are pivoting from a 9-5 to your own shop, you are sitting on a goldmine of warm leads. One community member shared a perfect example: they launched a student travel company by reaching out to a former client from an old job who kept asking for help every year.

Fear often keeps us from reaching out to old contacts, but this ""warm outreach"" is infinitely more effective than cold traffic. If you have a relationship, leverage it.

# 3. Solve One Problem, Then Ask

The formula isn't magic. It comes down to ""solving one real problem well"" for a person you already know. Once you deliver, you have to be aggressive about the follow-up. Don't just take the money; ask for the referral immediately.

**The bottom line:** Stop looking for a marketing hack. Your first ten customers are probably in your phone contacts right now.

Classes full of old poems and long essays. Then I met Professor Vanshika. She is 35. She is married but looks sad always. Her body is perfect. Curvy waist. Full chest that fills her ethnic dress. Strong thighs from walks. Long black hair. Her husband is also a teacher but he ignores her. No love. Just fights cause of her mother in law and no baby.

I am a bright student so I am in good books of her. I always volunteer for any work she assigns. One night, She posted a story on Instagram ""Alone born and will die alone, Why?"" It touched me. I sent a small poem I wrote.

Your night feels cold, heart heavy low
But words can warm, let feelings flow
One voice calls soft, from dark to day
Come find the light, do not fade away

She liked it. She messaged , That is deep. You understand. We chatted a lot. About poems. Her bad days . My college stress. She called me lover boy. She shared photos of her coffee and lonely food. Talk turned flirty. ""I wish you read to me here."" She fell for me slow. Hooked on my words.

First meet was thriller. After her class on love poems. Most students went to canteen. I stayed. Maam, about that poem.Her office small, Desk full of books. She smiled true. Said Sit here , We talked quiet. Her husband fight last night. He skips home. I don't know what happened,My hands went against her thighs to condole her, for a second she freeze, my voices in head said you are fucked up now. She slapped me on face, and told me to get out. 

Later , I was called in HOD's office, I thought now I am gone. My heart beated hard as soon as I entered the room , my english professor and HOD was staring at me . But later it came to my knowledge that there's a fire drill at college and I will coordinate my class.

I went to her office and she laughed at me ""got you"". Her eyes sparkled with fun. She locked the door. Pulled me close by shirt. ""You think you can touch me like that?"" Heart raced. She pushed me against wall. Kissed hard. Tongue deep. Then told me to meet me after college at her residence.

Her residence was nearby college, i went there just after college. She was wearing simple salwar. She told me to sit on sofa and asked for coffee , i said water please? She came back with a glass of water and suddenly she stopped. Eyes strong, ""Kneel, lover boy "" , the floor was cold , she hold me by my mouth and pour the water into my mouth. And laughed I had seen you liked many domme related post on Instagram. Then, she lifted her kameez. Dupatta off. No underwear. Already wet. ""Taste Mommy."" I went down. Tongue on her clit. Lick slow then fast. She held my hair. Hips moved. Whispered bad words in Hindi. She came hard. Thighs shook on my face, a squirt and lil piss. Then she tied dupatta on my hands. She removed my clothes slow. Body shone in light. Tight belly. Round bottom. Foot on my chest. Toes on my hard part. I begged. ""Please Mommy, do it."" She sat on top. Her wet part hot and tight. Slide down slow. Rode hard. Slapped my thighs. Chest in my face to suck. ""Deeper boy."" I pushed up. Her wet cum came on my balls. She stopped me. No finish till I cried.
After that she said now it's my turn, she used strap toy. Lube on it. Push in my back slow then fast. Pinched my chest tips. I came without hands. She laughed. Ice on my hard part. Sat on my face long time. No release.

This time last year I decided I needed a change. I (35M) started at ~215lbs 6’, I ate at a deficit and cut out most fried foods (dad of 3 so McDonald’s is inevitable every so often). I work on my feet and walk about 5 miles a day at work plus slinging the kids around while I’m home.

By the end of summer I was down to 175lbs and felt great but still had some stubborn belly fat. This holiday season I’ve gained back about 10lbs. My wife had a major surgery and I’ve been at home for the past 6 weeks being the sole care giver of everyone. 

I havent changed my diet incredibly, a little more snacking throughout the day. The one thing that has increased immensely is the amount of coffee I drink and the subsequent creamer.

A [while back](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/16da6cu/classic_wow_armory/) I shared my Classic WoW Armory project here for the first time, and the response completely exceeded my expectations. Since then, the amount of support from the community has been incredible. I have seen streamers using it, guilds sharing it, and people recommending it long before I even posted updates. Thank you all for that.

I have recently deployed a major update to the site, focused on quality-of-life improvements, polish, and preparing the Armory for what’s coming next, especially with TBC Anniversary approaching.

The goal has always been to recreate the feeling of the original Armory we all remember, while slowly expanding it with features the community actually wants.

With TBC Anniversary getting closer, there is more planned, and this update was a big step toward what’s coming next.

As always, feedback and suggestions are more than welcome. A lot of these features came directly from community input.

Thanks again for all the support ❤️

ich arbeite seit einigen Jahren mit einer Baratza Encore und war bisher eigentlich recht zufrieden. Ich trinke zu 90% Filterkaffee (V60, Specialty Coffee, helle Röstungen bevorzugt) und hin und wieder mal eine AeroPress oder Mokka-Pot. 

Nun ist es so, dass ich ein Upgrade auf die DF54 überlege. Folgende Gründe würden mMn dafür sprechen:

* Stufenlos einstellbar (ich hatte zuletzt immer mal wieder Probleme den perfekten Mahlgrad bei der Encore zu treffen)
* Scheibenmahlwerk
* Single Dose (eine absolute Kleinigkeit aber der große Hopper an der Encore nervt mich einfach :D)
* Espressofähig (da ich schon mit dem Gedanken spiele mich mit Espresso auseinandersetzen)
* Augenscheinlich ein unschlagbarer Preis

Ich würde mich über eine Einschätzung freuen oder vielleicht auch über Alternativvorschläge im gleichen Preisbereich (250 €).

I've never used a stove like this, so a few different behaviors I'm noticing...

This morning, as we were just drinking coffee and enjoying New Year's day, we had two kind of ""woomfs"" and then smoke coming out of the firebox. To me it sounded it similar to when our normal stove a log would drop and there'd be a puff of flame and smoke, but the more I'm reading, I'm realizing that there might be something else going on. 

It seems to be back to normal now, thermostat set to low, the typical low flame barely visible just at the catalyst, and catalyst red hot, just curious as we are both new to this kind of stove, if there's any red flags we should be worried about with these puffs of smoke... 

It is quite cold outside, but we've never had a problem with our chimney with our old stove. 
Our neighbors joked that they could see a lot of white smoke earlier this morning, but that has stopped as the stove got to active temp... 

Any troubleshooting for first-timers would be helpful! Thank you.

But as the new year begins, I wanted to highlight my top meals in 2025 in Mumbai. These do not include places I have already visited often or go to regularly. This is all new finds: restaurants, street-side stalls, and specific dishes. They are in no particular order.

1. **Persian Palette – Bandra, takeaway kitchen:** Their Persian kebabs are to die for. Nobody makes better or more “proper” koobideh kebabs than them in this city. I found their Indian fare okay, but the Persian side of the menu tastes very close to what I ate in Iran a couple of years ago.
2. **The Black Shephard – Bandra W:** Not everything on the menu is a hit. A lot of flops, but the hits really shine. Their fish and chips, though expensive, are quite authentic and right on the money. Their madeleines and burgers are also pretty good.
3. **Hilltop Bites – Malad West:** A vegetarian Sikkimese joint. Value for money and great food. Their jhol momo and wai wai sadeko are things you want to come back for every time.
4. **BBQ wings at an Ambassador car in Ulwe:** There is this small Ambassador parked near Sector 8, Ulwe. He does better BBQ than most chefs in Mumbai. Perfect smokiness, and not drowned in masala.
5. **Tost – Andheri West:** They put a lot of effort into their burgers. Surprisingly, I also loved their Filipino-style pork spring rolls.
6. **Luv Kitchen – Andheri West:** Neighbour to Tost. Chef Aditya is brilliant. This is possibly the most affordable “fine dine” in the city. Not everything is a winner, but the amount of effort he puts into his food is quite remarkable.
7. **Pinto Sando – Orlem, Malad West :** My English teacher’s son decided to open a small sandwich shop. I happened to visit just when they had opened. Their katre pao with that tender meat is excellent. They have grown big now, but the quality is still consistent. My favourite is the buff tongue sandwich.
8. **Bang Bang Noodles – Goregaon West:** If you have ever been to a hawker centre in Singapore, the food here will remind you of that. Hand-pulled noodles, and the chef is really trying to bring Sichuan flavours to the Indian palate. Not everything works, but what works is amazing. The cold Milo is a must to wash down all that spice.
9. **Project Hum – Versova:** I genuinely thought this would be another pretentious Versova café that would run its course and shut. But I was surprised by the kind of food they do. A mix of flavours they actually get right. Also, pretty good coffee. Their fate has not turned out like their neighbours at Sozo Izakaya.
10. **Maska Bakery – Mahim:** One of the best in Mumbai right now in terms of dessert, and this city has some great dessert spots. Whatever I have ordered from there has been excellent. They also know how to pack things properly.

There were other places as well, but these stood out in 2025. I got to travel a lot to other countries and a few Indian states this year, and will put a list of those meals too, if you all are interested. Let me know in the comments. I am also putting up a Google Maps link with these spots marked, in case you want to go explore them.

1q15m0r,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q15m0r,"Trip Report: One Week in Paris, First Time There (Part 1/2)","Hello!

I got back from a week in Paris last night and thought I'd share my itinerary and some general thoughts on my trip. 

This was my first time in Paris and in France in general. I absolutely fell in love with the place and am hoping to go back soon!

December 25th, arrival:
Arrived Christmas morning. Struggled a lot trying to figure out the RER into Paris and then in tapping my phone to get onto the train. I was surprised by the lack of assistance. For ex, in the city I live in, there are people standing around whose job it is to help explain this to people. I felt kind of left in the wild. Could have done more research. A guy from the U.S. helped me thankfully.

Wow. **Luxembourg Gardens**. This was my view when I stepped out of the train station for the first time in Paris. It was so beautiful.

I started my trip, after dropping off my luggage, by wandering around the 6th and Saint Germain, eventually popping into Saint Germain Church for a French mass.
After, I picked up some Christmas chocolate at a la mere de famille.  
I was then desperate for a pick me up and ended up at **Cafe d'auter**. I get that it's pricey (and maybe a tourist thing?) but I found the experience worth it. I just got a basic cappuccino and it was delightful. Also, a good place to sit down.
Walked some more and ended up with a buckwheat la parisienne crepe from **la charrette a crepes** in Saint Germain. This was very good!
Wandered around alleys and **Luxembourg Gardens**. Windowshopped, saw cool wall art and sculptures.
Eventually, popped in for hot chocolate at **Angelina's** smaller location in the 6th. I didn't realize I needed to request whipped cream and I am not a big chocolate fan so this was way too rich for me personally. I felt like I had to wipe the chocolate from my teeth afterward.
I properly checked into my hotel then, showered, and headed back out.
I ended up going into **Saint Severin** church (very pretty!), took some photos, and then wandered through a Christmas village that was open. 
Then: **Notre Dame**! 5:15 evening prayer and 6pm mass Christmas Day. I was very tired by this point and was nodding off toward the end. An amazing experience however!
I ended up picking up a delicious chicken sandwich from **Vieux Cedre** for dinner (basically wanderrd by, saw it was open, and decided that that would have to do for Christmas dinner) and ate in the hotel. 

December 26th, Day 2: 
I picked up a coffee from a random place around Montparnasse and then went into **Bopain** when they opened. I was up before the rest of the touristy districts, which I would highly recommend if you are able to one day! I got my very first pain suisse. Bopain is seriously so good!

I ended up walking to **Montparnasse Cemetery** before it felt like the rest of the city was awake. Bitterly cold but an amazing experience with no one else around. Basically wandered, cemeteries are fascinating to me, and toward the end of course did the touristy kind of places in the cemetery, Jane Birkin, Gainsbourg, Samuel Beckett.

At the recommendation of social media, I took the 6 line from Montparnasse to the last stop then back around to Montparnasse to get some cool shots of the Eiffel Tower. Not a must do in my opinion but the train was warmer and I felt like I was getting frost bite.

After, I went to the **Liberation of Paris Museum** in Montparnasse. I would really recommend! Someone on this sub recommended it to me. It was free admission, with a free tour of the underground bunker beneath the museum offered to me when I walked in. Informative and very enjoyable. 

Then, off to **Versailles**! I took the suburban train from Gare Montparnasse (thank you to the French gentleman who helped me find my train!! I struggled so much and he took the time to walk me through each step of how to get on) to Versailles, then an uber to the palace.

It was beautiful of course. I love interiors and history so this was special. I did the Palace and Petit Trianon but missed Grand Trianon. I would like to do this one again some summer and picnic and whatnot.

In the evening, I did their Christmas show which was enjoyable enough! I should have used Google translate like I saw other tourists doing to understand what they were saying. Some ballet, orchestra music, and opera within the rooms.

Then back to Paris via train!

It was late by this point and I ended up doing a smashburger from **Specimen** in Saint Germain and a dessert crepe from **la charrette crepe** stand, both delicious. I had tried doing the line at bouillon chartier but it was out of control that night, way too long for me.

December 27th, Day 3:

I ended up at **Bopain** again! I cannot recommend this one enough. Tried a croissant, chocolate beignet, and a cappuccino which I enjoyed on the seats in Luxembourg Gardens by the fountain. I really relaxed and just people watched.

I then tried **l'epi du prince** and got a cannele and another cappuccino. I would also highly recommend this one and the person working there every time I went in was so nice!

Did the **Concierge**! It was good and easy to get into. 

Walked down by the Seine then took a local bus to **Pere Lachaise**. This was good. I just grabbed some fruit from a local grocer to snack on and wandered the cemetery. Jim Morrison's grave was emotional for me but unfortunately at the time surrounded by the rudest American tourists of the trip. I actually enjoyed my experience at Chopin and Oscar Wilde's graves.

Then walked from the cemetery to the **Marais**! Grabbed cheese to snack on during the walk from a fromagerie. Then did lunch at **Pradel**! I tried beef bourginon, snails, and creme brulee for the first time! Snails and creme brulee were very good, the beef I did not like. It was very fatty and chewy, is this normal?

Then, **Victor Hugo's House Museum**. This made me a very big Victor Hugo enthusiast and I want to learn a lot about him, visit his property in Guernsey, and read his works.

 Specifically though... A lot of stuff on display was his mistress's and at no point in the exhibit that I saw did they make clear whether his wife was aware of this mistress or not. I was a little like, WTH people. They described her as his second wife in the exhibit and she like followed them to Guernsey and he furnished her home there. I need to read more to clarify some things.

After, I did hot chocolate at **Brigat** which was more enjoyable than the first I had in my opinion. I popped into the **Carnavelet museum** which I enjoyed. Then, wandered the Marais! I took pictures in front of Jim Morrison's last residence, got souvenirs from **Mielle Factory**, and basically wandered.

At the end of the night, I did the Vivaldi show at **Eglise Saint Paul St Louis**. This was very special! At the end, they did a cover of Cohen's Hallelujah and I'm a massive fan of his. Back to the hotel for rest afterward.

This will have to be Part 1 of 2 as my hand is cramping.

1q15lyq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1q15lyq/my_girlfriend_bought_me_the_same_expensive_gift/,My girlfriend bought me the same expensive gift as my mother,"There is one thing that I really wanted, let’s say a coffee machine (but it’s not and it is cheaper). The point is, this is a thing that doesn’t become more useful if you have more than one, it is also expensive for me and people whom I love.

It happened so that my mother decided to buy it for me as a present for this holiday season. And I found out that my girlfriend also ordered and paid for *probably* the same thing, which will arrive very soon. Now, neither of them knows about the situation. What should I do? 

I feel like if I say to my girlfriend that my mother already bought me the same gift, it will make her sad, considering that she spent a lot of money and put her time into it. But I’m not sure that hiding the fact that I have a pair of those gifts, while manageable, feels wrong",1,1767278254.0,Advice,3,1.0,False
1q15lw1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1q15lw1/am_i_overreacting_or_is_my_neighbor_wrong/,Am I overreacting? or is my neighbor wrong,"So a few days before christmas , my neighbor (was my grandmother's neighbor for like 30+ years) called me ask me what things my kids like and their clothing size. For context , my daughter is 7yo and my son is 19mo. This neighbor has never got my daughter a gift. We weren't living next to her when I had my son. We just moved back a few months ago after being away for 3 ywars. So i answer her questions , sizes and all of that. And now it's christmas morning. I get a text message from her to bring the kids over whenever to get their presents. I'm like , okay , we just started doing stockings. Of course , we have to do our own christmas , and then there's a little bit of cooking left to take to my husbands side for Christmas dinner. Needless to say the time got away with us. And we didn't have the time to go over there and see her before leaving. And I knew that by the time we got back, it would be dark and way past her time that she normally goes to bed. Which after 6pm she doesmt answer her door for anything and doesnt want calls or messages after 9pm. So I sent her a text message as we were leaving that I'll just bring the kids by sometime tomorrow and they can get their gifts then. The next morning , I wake up to a text message from her that she returned the items. I responded with no exchange with a question mark. Because she did tell me that she didn't realize she got the wrong size clothes for my daughter. She went a size down which my daughter kind of can were depending on fit. So I was like , we'll just try , and if it doesn't fit , we'll take it back in exchange. But this rubbed me a little bit the wrong way , and she never responded to my text message. Now given I've already told my daughter that our neighbor got them presents for Christmas.And Here , my daughter's asking when we can go over and get the presents. And I have to tell her , honestly don't know because she is not responded to my text. Which now it's new year's day and she never did respond to my text message. And yesterday  while I was working my husband took our kids outside and my daughter actually asked her (when the neighbor was checking her mail), when they could they come over to get the christmas presents. I did tell my daughter that i felt that was a little bit rude because people do not have to get you any presents. Especially people that are not family. 

Now this is where it gets mama bear p***** is the fact that she told my daughter. She returned the items and then proceeded to tell my daughter what she had actually bought her. And now my daughter feels like our neighbor hates her and doesn't understand why she bought her a christmas present , only to turn around and return it the very next day after christmas.

Now, for a little background, this is a neighbor that up until my grandmother's death in 2022, we always got her Christmas presents. It may not have been anything big. One year, I got her a $50 gift card (she had called me when someone crash thru my grandmother's fence and was stuck in her yard), $25 gift  card, there was other years it was like a coffee set or a hot chocolate gift set, just whatever.  And never once got anything from hear, even growing up.I was just always nice because she was nice and she was a neighbor and she would always keep an eye on my grandmother when I was not living with her. She'd call me if there was problems. 

So am I wrong or is she? I don't want to start anything with her but I feel this was way out of line. ",3,1767278249.0,AmIOverreacting,30,0.62,False
1q15liz,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiking_Nepal/comments/1q15liz/a_true_off_the_beaten_path_disconnected_off_grid/,"A true off the beaten path, disconnected, off grid and remote adventure in Nepal that no one talks about - Makalu Base Camp Trek - Everything you need to know from a Trekking Guide in Nepal","Hey everyone this is a series of articles that I am writing where I would attempt to bring a new trekking destination of the Himalayas for you. As I have seen the commercial offerings of Everest and Annapurna, nowadays even Manaslu, there are a group of trekkers who would love to be away from the masses and enjoy the serenity of the Himalayas as its meant to be. This remote and rustic adventure through the remote Eastern Himalayas of Nepal is a kind of adventure that awaits the likes of seasoned hikers who truly want solitude and serenity. 

Considered difficult and one of the remote treks lies the beautiful Barun Valley surrounded by the landscape that often feels unreal to the ones who embarks on this epic trek that takes you deep inside the Eastern side of the Himalayas, where you can view the majestic Everest, Lhotse, Nuptse, etc. and be right at the basecamp of the 5th Highest mountain the world Mt. Makalu. Starting your trek from the low subtropical vegetation and reaching the highest elevation 4800 meters, this trek is ideal if you are looking for digital detox, authentic experience and pristine wilderness. Hidden from the eyes of the commercial masses, this is an ideal outdoor adventure for the ones who are looking for a serene escape from the modern comforts and amenities, splurging in the nature, in the middle of nowhere for an experience that is almost incomparable to other trekking experiences in the Himalayas. Lying in the region of Makalu Barun National Park, this trek is rather unheard with very few trekkers less than 1000 visiting the region every year. 

**Permits and Entry Requirements**

The permits for Makalu Barun National Park can be purchased at Kathmandu, Nepal Tourism Board office or the National Park Office at Seduwa, which is our trek starting point. In addition to this, there is also a provision of Rural Municipality Permit. However, the last time I was there leading the trek, there were no mentions about this permit fees. 

There are no requirements of any other permits and permits are issued to Independent Trekkers contrary to the rule of mandatory Trekking Guide. 

**Getting to Makalu Barun National Park**

The most reasonable option to reach the trail head for this trek would be to get a flight from Kathmandu to Tumlingtar Airport. Upon reaching Tumlingtar Airport, you can get a Private Jeep from the Airport to the place called Seduwa that takes about 6-7 hours. The cost for private jeep hire is about 150 USD and Flight Tickets can be on the range of 125 USD. Buddha Air, a private domestic carrier does one flight every day to the airport and hence, acquiring the tickets are not a problem. You can purchase the flight tickets online from their [website.](https://www.buddhaair.com/)

Alternatively, you can also travel to Khandbari on a Shared Jeep, Micorbus or a Bus that takes about 8-10 hours from Kathmandu and should cost about NRs. 2500. The local jeep/microbus departs every morning from Koteshwor and tickets are not available online and hence, your ground contact needs to acquire the tickets beforehand. 

Other than that, you can take a shared Autorickshaw to the town of Khandbari and get a shared jeep from Khandbari to Num or Seduwa, where you can begin the trek. It should cost about NRs. 3000 per person for the jeep fare. However, looking at the road conditions and the crowd of the local jeeps, I recommend getting a Private Jeep Transfer. 

**Trekking Itinerary and No. of Days**

To complete the trek safely with adequate acclimatisation days, you would **require 16 days** starting from Kathmandu and ending at Kathmandu. 

The trek starts from the village of Seduwa where you reach on the Day 1 after the Flight from Kathmandu and 7 hours on the Jeep. On 2nd day, the trail is relatively easy to Tashigaon which takes about 5 hours. 

On Day 3, we start a rather steep uphilll hike to Khongma that takes about 6-7 hours, where we can have lunch at Dandakharka. Please bear in mind that the trail to Khongma is entirely uphill once you leave Tashigaon and feels the hardest than any other day of the hike. As you reach Khongma, the breathtaking views of the landscape below along with lively forest trails would definitely keep you longing for more in the coming days. 

Day 4 would be your acclimatisation day at Khongma since this is your fist night at 3500 meters. Today, you can take rest and let your body adapt to the altitude, as tomorrow we have to traverse the Shipton La (pass) at 4200 metres to reach Dobate and onto the beautiful Barun Valley. 

Day 5, we would trek from Khongma via uphill trail till we traverse the beautiful Shipton La. The views of the breathtaking valleys on both sides of the pass along with glimpses of Makalu range and Kanchenjunga range enroute are the highlights of this day. 

Having our lunch at one of the two teashops at the pass, we traverse Shipto La via 2 beautiful natural ponds which has got religious significance for the local people and descend down to Dobate which is the entry point to Barun Valley. 

To spare you the details of the itinerary, here is an overview of the trek:  
Day 6 - Dobate to Yangle Kharka   
Day 7 - Hike to Shivdhara and Parvati Caves  
Day 8 - Hike to Langmale Kharka  
Day 9 - Langmale to Makalu Base Camp  
Day 10 - Hike to Makalu View Point  
Day 11 - Makalu Base Camp to Yangle Kharka  
Day 12 - Yangle Kharka to Dobate  
Day 13 - Dobate to Khongma  
Day 14 - Khongma to Tashigaon  
Day 15 - Tashigaon to Seduwa (Hike) and Jeep to Tumlingtar  
Day 16 - Tumlingtar to Kathmandu (Flight)

**Highlights of the trek**

Barun Valley is one of the most pristine destination surrounded by the entirety of Makalu Range. Void of permanent human settlement, this valley is the alpine meadows used by the people of the Makalu region to herd their Yaks, Sheeps and Goats. Surrounded by 100s of waterfalls and the beatuiful Barun river that comes from the glaciers of Makalu range, the true beauty of this valley is showcased in monsoon periods when the wildflowers bloom, the landscape comes alive and the occassional mingle of Shepherds and Yak Herders just add to its experience. 

Makalu Base Camp, is one of the destination that grants you with one of the most breathtaking views of Mt. Makalu directly from the basecamp to the summit. A short hike to the Makalu View Point grants you an awe inspiring views of the rarely viewed and photographed, Everest, Lhotse and Nuptse in the distance and a longer hike to the High View Point even grants you the views of the vast Tibetan plateus that lies beyond the Himalayas. 

Remoteness of the trek is one of the beautiful aspect of the trek. Without any connection to the outside world, this is a perfect escape for trekkers who is looking for an off the beaten path adventure. The rustic and authentic experience of the trek is comparable only to few other treks in Nepal which I will address periodically in other articles. 

**Teahouse and/or Camping and Food**

This trek can be completed without any camping equipment or support. There are basic teahouses (not more than 1 or 2) in all the rest stops and the choices are abundant. You can indulge yourself in the basic and hearty meals with the good choice of traditional local and Nepalese dishes and some choices of Western dishes like Porridge, Pasta, etc. 

I would suggest packing a Sleeping Bag, as with the less number of teahouses, there might not be enough blankets and the rooms are not well insulated which means the night time temperatures might dip down and the blankets provided by the teahouse is not enough. Regarding the food, Eggs are your main source of protien along with occassional 'sukuti' if your appetite allows for that which is a smoke and sun dried strips of Yak meat. 

Other than this, you should pack plenty of powerbars and snacks as the distance between lunch stops and the teahouses is long and we need refuelling along the way. It is also helpful if you can pack a small cook system such as **Jetboil** so that you can have hot water/tea/coffee as you feel like along the trail. 

**Sanitation, Hygiene, Laundry Situation and Drinking Water**

As with most of the remote treks in Nepal, there are no provisions of Hot Showers/Gas Showers once we cross Seduwa. There are provisions of Bucket Showers at every tea house. We managed to avail Bucket Shower at Khongma, Yangle Kharka and Langmale for this 16 days trek. 

The toilets are Squat toilets and I would suggest packing Hand Sanitiser and Toilet Paper. You can also purchase Toilet Paper along the way and hence, no need to packk extensive quantity. 

The teahouses we stay in prepare and handle the food in a safe manner. I haven't observed dirty sanitation and hygiene issues in any of the teahouses and is sufficienty safe for the trek. However, I would still suggest you to pack some Medicines which we will discuss about it later down the article. 

Regarding the Drinking water, there are plentiful supply of running water along the way. However, I strongly recommend using **Water Purification Tablets** or **Filtration system** such as **Lifestraw, Sawyer or Ketadyn.** I recommend using no more than 2 litres Nalgene Bottle or a Hydration Bladder as we can fill up the water in every lunch stops and tea houses. 

Lastly, Laundry is not available throughout the trek. I would suggest packing in possibly a Laundry Liquid like Sea to Summit Wilderness Wash or Laundry Wash and handwashing your items as you go. You can also use dedicated Laundry system such as [this](https://thescrubba.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoqQOpqu5lHzJJhbNQpetg9ZSItbvfMmRu-1H28dqKPbQfWoNRMg). 

**Medication, Emergency Care and Evacuation**

For medication along with the ones prescribed your GP, it is essential to carry atleast the following: 

* Cold and Flu Tablets
* Diarrhoea Medications and OTC Antacids and Electrolytes
* Broadspectrum Antibiotics as prescribed by your GP
* Anti Allergy Medications (If Any)
* Paracetamol and Ibuprofen
* Crepe Bandage, Blister Tapes, Band Aids, Medical Tapes and Sterile Dressing pad 
* Acetazolamide (Diamox), Dexamethasone

Most of the first aid medications would be carried by your Trek Guide. However, I would suggest getting the Cold & Flu Tablets, Diarrhoea Medications, OTC Antacids and Anti Biotics from back home. Other than that medications like Diamox and Dexamethasone should only be taken after your consultation with GP to know about any medicinal allergy and preliminary physical conditions. 

As for the **Emergency Care,** there is small health clinic at Seduwa which we reach on the first day of the trek. There is not a dedicated treatment centre along the hike and we must be very proactive in managing the issues of **Altitude Sickness or any other health issues.** 

For **Evacuation,** since the trek is remote having the options of riding a Mule or Horse is difficult to impossible due to the terrain. The only option that we have is to call for **Heli Evac**, and hence having a **high altitude trek insurance** that **covers heli evac** is almost mandatory for this trek. 

**Cost and Other Details**

If you are doing the trek independently, you can expect to complete this trek on the range of 1800 USD to 2600 USD that includes: 

* Kathmandu to Tumlingtar Two Way Flight
* Private Jeep Transfer from Tumlingtar to Seduwa and Back
* Makalu Barun National Park Permit Fees
* Food and Accommodation during the trek

However, if you are looking to do this trek with a Trek Assist and a Guide, then you can expect the cost to be:

* Guide Fees at 40 USD per day (640 USD)
* Trek Assist at 20 USD per day (280 USD)

I would suggest the ideal value is doing this trek with the **minimum of 2-4 people**. This way, most of the fees including the Private Transports, Guide and Trek Assist fees, etc are divided among the members and thus provides reasonable value for the expenses. 

**Packing and Preparation**

For Packing and Preparation, I would suggest suggest trying to Pack lightly with all the essentials. Having to depart on at least 10-12 multi day high altitude treks every year, I understand if some of the items below doesn't conform to your requirements and thus can be adjusted accordingly. From my experience of exclusively leading remote treks such as Kanchenjunga, I pack the following for each of my treks along with the associated brand for each of the clothing

1 Fleece Beanie (IB Merino)  
2 Neck Buff (SPF - BUFF and Mid weight BUFF)  
2 Hiking Full Sleeved Quick Dry Hiking Tshirts (Offbrand)  
1 Merino Half Sleeve Hiking Tshirt (Forclaz)  
1 Ice Breaker 260 GSM Merino Thermal Base Layer  
4 Pair of Merino Wool Hiking Socks and 1 pair of Heavy Alpine Trekking Socks (Rohner)  
4 Pair of Underwear (Offbrand)  
2 Hiking Trouser -(1 RAB Torque Mountain and 1 RAB Torque Winter Pants)  
1 Hiking Shorts (Forclaz)  
1 Mid Layer Fleece ( RAB Evolute)  
1 Down Jacket (RAB Neutrino Pro)  
1 Goretex Shell Top (OR Foray II)  
1 Goretex Shell Bottom (Marmot Minimalist Rain Trousers)  
1 Fleece Gloves (RAB Power Stretch Pro)  
1 Heavy Gloves (BD Guide Gloves)

1 First Aid Kit with all the aforementioned items  
1 Pair of Knee Compression Sleeves  
Jetboil Minimo and Butane Canister   
Hydralyte Electrolyte Satchets  
1 Victorinox Multi Tool  
1 BD Cosmo Headlamp and spare batteries (AAA Duracell)  
1 ltr Nalgene Bottle   
2 ltr Platypus Hydration Bladder

1 Sleeping Bag (Neutrino Pro Comfort R -4C)  
1 Pair of Trekking Shoes (La Sportiva TX S)  
1 Pair of Flipflops

3-4 Powerbars and some snacks

Toiletry and Personal Hygeine Kit including Sea to Summit Wilderness Wash for Laundry

Packed in 70 ltrs Forclaz MT100 Easyfit

After all the wearables, the bagpack the weight is around 12-14 kgs or 26-30 lbs. This is the standard weight that I carry as part of the job and thus, can be more lenient or light depending on your needs or preferences. 

**Connectivity and Electricity**

The last place to have cellular connectivity would be Tashi Gaon and the last place to have cellular connectivity along with Internet connection would be the first day of your trek at Seduwa. Beyond Tashi Gaon, you have very sparse cell connectivity until Khongma and almost zero connectivity after Khongma especially over Shipton La. 

Still, I would suggest getting a **NTC Simcard** after you land in Nepal which has got more remote connectivity than other popular carrier **NCell**.

I suggest you have a Satellite Communicator like InReach Mini to let your loved ones know about your situation. I personally use InReach Explorer for general messaging for remote treks and Thuraya Satellite Phone exclusively for Emergency Communication. 

Like Cellphone connectivity, the last point to have electricity would be Seduwa. Beyond Seduwa, the villages are only**powered by Solar** and hence, I would suggest carrying a Power Bank and a Portable Solar Panel (if required) if you have lots of electronic devices (Camera, GPS, Smarwatch, Cellphone). 

**Cash and Currency Exchange**

Since the trek is disconnected from the grid, I would suggest having all the cash in **Nepalese Rupees**. I understand that you might be hiking with big chunk of cash but the trek itself is very safe and you don't need to worry about misdeeds. 

I would suggest 60 USD worth of Nepalese rupees per day for your F/A Expenses and about NRs. 20,000 more as an emergency or backup fund. There are no currency exchange facilities once you leave Kathmandu and hence, I would suggest doing it at any of the currency exchange shops at Thamel. There are some ATM at the town of Khandbari but it can be pretty hit or miss with the international cards and hence, suggest you for all the transactions at Kathmandu itself. 

**Other FAQs**

**Is hiring a Guide mandatory for doing this trek?**

Contrary to the rules, it hasn't been enforced and you can easily do this trek by yourself. However, since this is a remote trek and if you aren't experienced to multi day high altitude treks, then I would recommend having a trekking guide for this trek who can arrange the logistics of the trek as well as Guide you along the way. 

**What is the weight limitation for Trek Assists?**

We don't have mandated weight limitations. However, I would suggest trying to keep the weight under 8 kgs, as the Trek Assists are shared among 2 trekkers. With 16 kgs of luggage and 4-5 kgs of his own bagpack we ensure our Trek Assist is carrying no more than 20-21 kgs or 40 lbs. 

Also, if you are hiring a Trek Assis, we should pack the stuff in good bagpacks probably 100 ltr capacity so that the they don't need to use the [head straps](https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-nepalese-porters-use-a-head-strap-locally-called-a-namlo-to-support-81980000.html) which might be detrimental to their healthy mainly due to **vertebral compression**. Although the head straps have been used since years ago, we must be the part of positive change to our Trek Assists and help them have a better and safe work environments. 

**How do I select the Agency or go forward for this trek?**

For remote treks, I believe there are only handful of Agencies and Trekking Guides who have the experience of organising and leading these kind of treks. Most of the agencies and websites shall feed you the same information just paraphrased along the way. This is one of your indicators that the Agency or the Trekking Guide doesn't know what they are selling to you. 

You can ask for recent information regarding the trail such as till last October, the Jeep access was only up to the village of Num and a bit below to the place called Chamlakharka. However, it has been about 3 months that they have completed the bridge and now the jeep access is till Seduwa. 

You can ask for pictures of Makalu Base Camp with their clients. Most of the trekking guides have atleast one photo with their clients or the trekking agencies have photo with their banners.

Lastly, ask for referrals from the clients that they have done the exact trek before. At this day and age, I don't trust just the reviews but a real world referral of the trek experience of any previous client who completed this particular trek. 

Just last year, an inexperienced trekking guide who was leading a trek in Kanchenjunga region at the time of torrential rainfall failed to get updated with the alternative trail. While I was leading the trek via the alternative trail, we could see a landslide on the old trail that had caused one of his team member (Camp Kitchen Staff) to be buried underneath and passing away just an hour ago. The trek guide was new to the region and had only led the way based in internet accounts and relying on offline apps for navigation. Having the first hand knowledge of the landscape, potential fall areas, alternative trails, etc. are the key to leading a safe trek. 

**Conclusion**

Makalu Base Camp trek is one of the most pristine destination hidden away from the commerical masses of the trekkers. Mainly the remoteness of the trek that requires significant time contribution acts as a deterrent to many trekkers. If you are looking for a perfect alternative to Everest Base Camp but still want to see Everest and also Mt. Makalu, then this remote adventure will check all the boxes to be an authentic experience of the Himalayas. 

Thank you for readind through this article and hope this helps for your planning. There is only so much I could share.

My husband and I are considering purchasing a Nespresso or an actual espresso machine in the near future. I'm kinda leaning more towards the Nespresso because I know that getting into an actual espresso machine is a hell of a lot more work and general effort than I think either of us would want to do daily, and I don't want to pay the prices I've seen for the automatic machines lol. 

Basically, looking for opinions on which machine is best, with these considerations:

1) We really only drink iced lattes, especially him
2) Neither of us drink brewed/drip coffee, we only like espresso
3) Looking to get this as a ""money saver"" as we currently go out almost daily to buy coffees(yes, I know... not here for a lecture on that end, lol)

Would also love opinions and recommendations on pods fitting the espresso/latte drinkers only vibe, if that makes sense.

针对客户质疑Qrevo Curv 2 Flow 高温洗布功能出水温度不够热的应对话术:

Qrevo Curv 2 Flow 的高温洗布功能主要在洗布流程前期进行加热。这里提到的 75°C 指的是基站加热器附近的温度， 并非滚筒或出水口的实时水温。

在实际洗布过程中,水流会受到周围环境温度以及清水箱水温的影响,热量在传输过程中会产生一定的散失, 因此实际温度会有所下降, 属于正常现象。

此外,在洗布流程后期,为了控制滚筒上的含水量, 系统会进行甩干动作,这一过程也会进一步降低滚筒表面的温度。

需要说明的是,在清洁任务开始前的打湿洗阶段, 系统不会启用高温洗布功能.。

Google Translate:
Regarding customer concerns about insufficient water temperature in the Qrevo Curv 2 Flow high-temperature wash function:

The Qrevo Curv 2 Flow's high-temperature wash function primarily heats the water in the early stages of the wash cycle. The 75°C mentioned here refers to the temperature near the base station heater, not the real-time water temperature of the drum or outlet.

During the actual wash process, the water flow is affected by the ambient temperature and the temperature of the clean water tank. Some heat is lost during transmission, resulting in a slight temperature drop, which is normal.

Furthermore, in the later stages of the wash cycle, the system performs a spin-drying action to control the water content on the drum, further reducing the drum surface temperature.

It should be noted that the high-temperature wash function is not activated during the wet wash phase before the cleaning task begins.

==================================

Does the explanation above makes sense anyone? 

Can someone please tell me I am not crazy to think that the based station has a water heater built in? 😂

Recently I sent in my Curv 2 Flow for repair because it doesnt have hot water mop washing and above is the explanation I got from my local support who escalated to his counterpart in China..

In short they are saying the base station doesn't have a water heater built in and the water is heated by the dryer as it flows out from the water outlets.

Guys this is a new technology okay.. Next time u cook your noodles or drink a coffee, please use your hair dryer to heat up the water.. Do not use gas or a boiler.. 🤣

No matter the use case, the ultimate goal of AI is to enhance human happiness, and decrease pain and suffering. Boosting enterprise productivity and scientific discovery, as well as any other AI use case you can think of, are indirect ways to achieve this goal.  But what if AI made a much more direct way to boost an individual's happiness and peace of mind possible? If AI led to a new medical drug that makes the average person 40 to 50% more calm and happier, and had fewer side effects than coffee, would you take this new medicine?

Before your answer, let's address the ""no, because it wouldn't be natural."" objection. Remember that we all live in an extremely unnatural world today. Homes protected from the elements are unnatural. Heating, air conditioning and refrigeration are unnatural. Food processing is usually unnatural. Indoor lighting is unnatural. Medicine is unnatural. AI itself is extremely unnatural. So these peace and happiness pills really wouldn't be less natural than changing our mood and functioning with alcohol, caffeine and sugar, as millions of us do today. 

The industrial revolution happened over a long span of over 100 years. People had time to get accustomed to the changes. This AI revolution we're embarking on will transform our world far more profoundly by 2035. Anyone who has read Alvin Toffler's book, Future Shock, will understand that our human brain is not evolutionarily biologically equipped to handle so much change so quickly. Our world could be headed into a serious pandemic of unprecedented and unbearable stress and anxiety. So while we work on societal fixes like UBI or, even better, UHI, to mitigate many of the negative consequences of our AI revolution, it might be a good idea to proactively address the unprecedented stress and unpleasantness that the next 10 years will probably bring as more and more people lose their jobs, and AI changes our world in countless other ways. 

Ray Kurzweil predicts that in as few as 10 to 20 years we humans could have AI-brain interfaces implanted through nanobots delivered through the blood system. So it's not like AI is not already poised to change our psychology big time. 

Some might say that this calmness and happiness pill would be like the drug, Soma, in Aldous Huxley's novel, Brave New World. But keep in mind that Huxley ultimately went with the dubious ""it's not natural"" argument against it. This AI revolution that will only accelerate year after year could be defined as extremely unnatural. If it takes unnatural countermeasures to make all of this more manageable, would these countermeasures make sense?

If a new pill with fewer side effects than coffee that makes you 40 to 50% calmer and happier were developed and fast-FDA-approved to market in the next few years, would you take it in order to make the very stressful and painful changes that are almost certainly ahead for pretty much all of us (remember, emotions and emotional states are highly contagious) much more peaceful, pleasant and manageable?

1q15d6o,https://i.redd.it/ep79t86izqag1.jpeg,Help me think this through,"Not really hot tent related but I'm guessing the best place to get answers for my situation.

I'm building a 12 wide by 8 deep ""man cave shed"" sloped roof from front to back 8 foot front 7 foot back. 2x4 exposed studs on the inside and metal siding and roof. May eventually cover the walls.

There is a 7x6 opening in the front that will not have a door. I will utilize a tarp when needed. Think Appalachian trail type shelter if you know anything about them.

I love sitting by a fire and started looking at hot tent stoves as a possible stove for this little shed. I absolutely love the idea of the view glass view on the sides of the stove and was leaning toward the winterwell nomad series. For whatever reason I missed that the view only has glass on one side and not to be a stickler about it, but I really want it on both sides for people sitting around it to be able to enjoy the fire view. 

The only other option I can find other than the cheap Amazon or Temu brands which I don't trust is the KingCamp surefire series.

One question I have is the stove pipe and according to their specs for the medium for the KingCamp surefire medium with the height of the stove and the included pipe it looks to be about 8 ft and with the back of my shed being a 7-ft ceiling with the slope is that going to be enough height to get enough draw. 

I plan on using a barrier between it and the back wall to get as close to the wall as possible. The walls currently will just be studded walls with the metal siding..

I will be using it for coffee and probably doing a little cooking and obviously heat and was leaning toward the small version in both those stoves mentioned. But now I'm wondering if I need a medium size. 

I realize that's probably overkill for a 12x8 96 square foot shed, but my thoughts are a bigger cooking space and not having to put wood in as often so now, I'm leaning toward the medium-sized KingCampSurefire.

Does anyone have any any experience with this stove and especially in a shed and not a tent? Any thoughts on the medium size versus small? 

Any thoughts or input would be greatly appreciated.

Their katre pao with that tender meat is excellent. They have grown big now, but the quality is still consistent. My favourite is the buff tongue sandwich.
8. **Bang Bang Noodles – Goregaon West:** If you have ever been to a hawker centre in Singapore, the food here will remind you of that. Hand-pulled noodles, and the chef is really trying to bring Sichuan flavours to the Indian palate. Not everything works, but what works is amazing. The cold Milo is a must to wash down all that spice.
9. **Project Hum – Versova:** I genuinely thought this would be another pretentious Versova café that would run its course and shut. But I was surprised by the kind of food they do. A mix of flavours they actually get right. Also, pretty good coffee. Their fate has not turned out like their neighbours at Sozo Izakaya.
10. **Maska Bakery – Mahim:** One of the best in Mumbai right now in terms of dessert, and this city has some great dessert spots. Whatever I have ordered from there has been excellent. They also know how to pack things properly.

There were other places as well, but these stood out in 2025. I got to travel a lot to other countries and a few Indian states this year, and will put a list of those meals too, if you all are interested. Let me know in the comments. I am also putting up a Google Maps link with these spots marked, in case you want to go explore them.

1q15c9h,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepSeek/comments/1q15c9h/if_ai_created_a_pill_that_made_you_40_50_calmer/,"If AI created a pill that made you 40% - 50% calmer and happier with fewer side effects than coffee, would you take it?","

No matter the use case, the ultimate goal of AI is to enhance human happiness, and decrease pain and suffering. Boosting enterprise productivity and scientific discovery, as well as any other AI use case you can think of, are indirect ways to achieve this goal.  But what if AI made a much more direct way to boost an individual's happiness and peace of mind possible? If AI led to a new medical drug that makes the average person 40 to 50% more calm and happier, and had fewer side effects than coffee, would you take this new medicine?

Before your answer, let's address the ""no, because it wouldn't be natural."" objection. Remember that we all live in an extremely unnatural world today. Homes protected from the elements are unnatural. Heating, air conditioning and refrigeration are unnatural. Food processing is usually unnatural. Indoor lighting is unnatural. Medicine is unnatural. AI itself is extremely unnatural. So these peace and happiness pills really wouldn't be less natural than changing our mood and functioning with alcohol, caffeine and sugar, as millions of us do today. 

The industrial revolution happened over a long span of over 100 years. People had time to get accustomed to the changes. This AI revolution we're embarking on will transform our world far more profoundly by 2035. Anyone who has read Alvin Toffler's book, Future Shock, will understand that our human brain is not evolutionarily biologically equipped to handle so much change so quickly. Our world could be headed into a serious pandemic of unprecedented and unbearable stress and anxiety. So while we work on societal fixes like UBI or, even better, UHI, to mitigate many of the negative consequences of our AI revolution, it might be a good idea to proactively address the unprecedented stress and unpleasantness that the next 10 years will probably bring as more and more people lose their jobs, and AI changes our world in countless other ways. 

Ray Kurzweil predicts that in as few as 10 to 20 years we humans could have AI-brain interfaces implanted through nanobots delivered through the blood system. So it's not like AI is not already poised to change our psychology big time. 

Some might say that this calmness and happiness pill would be like the drug, Soma, in Aldous Huxley's novel, Brave New World. But keep in mind that Huxley ultimately went with the dubious ""it's not natural"" argument against it. This AI revolution that will only accelerate year after year could be defined as extremely unnatural. If it takes unnatural countermeasures to make all of this more manageable, would these countermeasures make sense?

If a new pill with fewer side effects than coffee that makes you 40 to 50% calmer and happier were developed and fast-FDA-approved to market in the next few years, would you take it in order to make the very stressful and painful changes that are almost certainly ahead for pretty much all of us (remember, emotions and emotional states are highly contagious) much more peaceful, pleasant and manageable?

Happy and peaceful New Year everyone!

1q15adq,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1q15adq/i_started_saying_hi_to_the_same_stranger_every/,"I started saying hi to the same stranger every morning, and it quietly rewired my whole year","When I moved to a new city I told everyone I was excited. New start, new routines, new me.

In reality I was doing this weird half life where youre technically surrounded by people all day but you still go days without anyone saying your name out loud.

My mornings were the same. Wake up, shower, throw on something acceptable, leave my apartment with that slightly stiff feeling like Im playing a person who has it together.

Downstairs theres a little bakery on the corner. I started going there because it was the closest place that smelled warm.

Id buy the same thing every time, mostly because decision making before 9am feels like a personal attack. A coffee and whatever pastry looked least likely to crumble on my shirt.

And every morning at the same time there was this older man sitting at the same table by the window. Always. Same corner seat, same newspaper folded into neat squares, same slow sip of tea like time had never yelled at him once.

At first I did what everyone does in a city, I pretended he wasnt there.

Then one morning I walked in and the barista was swamped and the line was long and I was already late, and I guess my face was doing that ""dont talk to me Im barely alive"" thing.

When I walked past his table the man looked up and just said very calmly,

""Good morning.""

Not in a weird way, just like I existed.

I surprised myself by answering. ""Morning.""

That was it, two words. But for some reason as I walked out I felt less invisible.

The next day I nodded first. ""Morning.""

He nodded back. ""Good morning.""

And then it became a thing. Not a friendship, not a conversation, just a small exchange that somehow kept me from going fully feral.

Some days it was only a nod. Some days hed add ""cold one today"" or ""you look tired"" like he was stating a fact not judging. And Id laugh a little and say yeah and keep moving.

It was so simple I didnt even realize it mattered until the morning it didnt happen.

I walked into the bakery and the corner table was empty. No newspaper, no tea, just sunlight on an empty chair.

I felt this stupid immediate disappointment like Id lost something I didnt have the right to miss.

I told myself not to be dramatic, people have lives, maybe he just came later or stopped coming or got sick.

I stood there way longer than normal pretending to look at pastries waiting to see if hed walk in. He didnt.

The next day same thing, empty chair. The next day again.

And now it was this tiny quiet worry I carried around all day even though it felt ridiculous to worry about a person whose last name I didnt know.

On the fourth day I finally asked the barista trying to sound casual.

""Hey um the guy who usually sits over there, by the window, is he okay?""

She blinked like she was deciding if I was safe then softened. ""Oh, Mr Lechner.""

So he had a name.

""He broke his hip, hes in the hospital. His daughter came in and told us. He was upset because he said he missed his morning routine.""

I dont know why but that hit me harder than it should have because I realized I wasnt the only one who needed that routine.

So that night I did something I normally would never do, I wrote a note. Not a big emotional note, just a small one on receipt paper because I didnt have anything else.

Hi Mr Lechner Its the girl who walks past your table every morning The bakery feels weird without you Hope youre healing fast See you at the window seat soon

Then I stared at it for ten minutes like it was a confession.

Next day I gave it to the barista and asked if she could give it to his daughter if she came in. I felt ridiculous the whole time, like who am I to send a note to a stranger?

Two days later I walked in and there was an envelope taped to the inside of the pastry case. My name wasnt on it because he didnt know it but the barista saw me and smiled like shed been waiting.

""Thats for you.""

Inside was a handwritten card, the kind old people still send.

Good morning Thank you for noticing when I wasnt there I didnt know your name so I asked. Its on the back of this card because my daughter said I should stop being stubborn You were part of my routine too See you soon

On the back in slightly shakier handwriting:

Your name?

I stood there holding that card and felt my eyes get hot immediately which was annoying because I had to go to work and pretend Im a functional adult.

So I grabbed a pen from the counter and wrote my name on the back. Then I added without thinking too hard:

Window seat is reserved. Dont argue.

A week later he came back. Walker instead of cane, newspaper still folded into neat squares.

He looked up when I walked in and smiled like wed been friends for years.

""Good morning.""

""Good morning.""

Same two words, same nothing conversation. But it didnt feel like nothing anymore.

Because the truth is I didnt move to a new city and instantly build a life, I built it the way you actually build things, one tiny repeated moment at a time.

And sometimes it starts with something as small as an empty chair and realizing youd miss it.",71,1767277332.0,stories,7,1.0,False
1q159o8,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1q159o8/heavy_on_mommy_issues/,Heavy on mommy issues.,"The whole ride on our way to my apartment, I sang along to the radio, asking my mom random stuff. But I felt like my voice would shake if I don’t scream along the song, I wanted to cry. I haven’t cried for a year. If I did, it was very short because of some K-drama about grandmas, mom-and-daughter focus.

I know I hurt my mom because she knows she can’t control me anymore, so she try to make me pity her so I would stay and forgive her for how I grew up. I don’t remember much from my childhood. But whenever I reminded her of the things she’s done that I could remember, she’d say “Kelan ko ginawa ‘yon?” “Oh, you don’t remember anymore? I was a kid! I could never even forget how much I begged you.” And she’d be quiet.

I grew up wanting to always please her, careful with my actions and words because I know she’s sensitive and easily blows up like my dad. As a kid, I was easy to punish and control because I’m powerless and clueless. I learned how to crash out on my brother because I saw her do it whenever she’s angry with me or my dad. 

In junior high, I learned to bang my head against the wall when I’m afraid to talk back to her, until my forehead bleeds. She never did anything. When I calm down, forming fetus on my bed, she comes in and brushes my hair, my eyes & nosetip still red from crying, but my eyes turn empty by then, no more tears. Then she tells me, “Nasa utak mo lang ‘yan. Kaya mo naman kontrolin ‘yan.”

My dad told me na pagpasensyahan siya because she’s sensitive. Now he tells me to cut her some slack because she’s getting old. I get it. I want to be a good daughter, give her a good life, just not be part of it much. She wanna plan my life ahead— the career I should pursue (that’s why I became a nurse, because she wants me to be a doctor), the partner I’ll marry, the home I’ll live in, but I already have plans for myself.

She cries whenever I would leave her speechless. So I get quiet, compensate the next day by treating her coffee or bringing her to the mall. I never learned to say “Sorry” ever since she stopped putting me on a sack & locking me in kitchen cabinets with cockroaches because I don’t fit there anymore. 

I get in my room (and now in my studio apartment), to finally cry. Feel guilty and ashamed for hurting her with words thinking if I was so wrong for it. 

I feel getting sick and I wanna throw up. ",1,1767277274.0,OffMyChestPH,1,1.0,False

I drink dark roast (Starbuck's french roast almost exclusively now) and grind new for every brew.  I'm aware of the golden ration starting point but I don't need to use more than 25g for a 10 cups of coffee for the Krups (I used to measure out the water but after so many years can eyeball the volume poured into the carafe and then into reservoir). And, some people find it way too strong but I drink w a bit of half/half to smooth out some of the bitterness which I like.  
Finally decided to try out the Moccamaster; old machine is fine but occupies more space and space saving was a benefit for a small kitchen.  Have run several brews and playing around with grind size but sticking around my 25g mark so far.  I will try what I've seen in the posts of going up into the 50/60/70g range for 10 cups but I'm going to find it hard to keep the Moccamaster if I'm using 2-2.5x the grounds.  
Recommendations/advice/comments to stick with Moccamaster, which I was looking forward to lasting the next 30 years.

edit 1: for reference, a 10 cup brew on the Moccamaster uses 40 oz of water; 1 1/4 - 10 line on reservoir.

edit 2: thanks for all the feedback so far.  I'll have to see how it brews/tastes with more grounds.",2,1767277148.0,Moccamaster,17,0.75,False
