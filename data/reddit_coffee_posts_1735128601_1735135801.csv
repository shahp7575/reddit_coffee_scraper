First time posting here. I wanted to share something real with you all. I'm 18, running a SaaS business with $4K MRR, and I want to tell you how I got here. Not to brag - seriously - but to show other young people that age is just a number, and we shouldn't let anyone tell us otherwise.

## The Minecraft Years (Where it all started)

This might sound crazy, but Minecraft literally changed my life. At 13, while other kids were just playing, I was obsessed with coding plugins. Every. Single. Night. Looking back, it was probably a bit much (sorry, mom!), but man, it taught me so much.

You know what's wild? I keep seeing successful tech people who started with Minecraft. It makes sense though - running a Minecraft server is basically running a mini-business:
- You need to manage moderation (customer support)
- Build a community (marketing)
- Work with other devs (team management)
- Keep players happy (user retention)

## The Coding Journey

That Minecraft obsession? It gave me this crazy problem-solving mindset. Everyone's bashing video games these days, but let's be real - gaming can literally launch your career if you approach it right.

I'm now a fullstack freelance developer. When I tell people my age, they usually don't believe it. But here's the thing - starting early with something you're passionate about is like a cheat code for life.

## Building My First SaaS (The Reality Check)

So, I built my SaaS in 3 weeks (yeah, I know, pretty fast). But then I had this ""oh crap"" moment: ""Wait... I can code, but how the hell do I get customers? Do I even know how to market this thing?""

Big reality check. 

Instead of panicking, I went full nerd mode on marketing books. Here's what I learned: Never limit yourself to what you already know. Your technical skills are just the beginning.

## The Marketing Hustle

You know what's funny? The whole idea started in a coffee shop. I was helping someone with their homework, and suddenly it hit me - the real problem wasn't with the students, it was with the entire educational system.

So I started investigating the schools' side of things. Man, that was a reality check. Getting through to decision-makers in education is TOUGH. These aren't your typical SaaS customers - they move slow, they're careful with change, and they have complex approval processes.

But instead of going for the hard sell, I tried something different. I booked a meeting with one school administrator. Just to listen. Turned out to be the best decision ever. Schools were drowning in administrative work that could easily be automated.

My approach shifted completely. Started super small. One school. Made sure every single feature solved a real problem they had. When it worked, they became my best case study.

Word spread in the education community. Other administrators started reaching out. Turns out schools talk to each other way more than I thought. Each new client helped refine the product further.

The business model clicked naturally - charging per student made sense to everyone. Schools get it, it scales with their size, and it's predictable for their budgets. That's how we reached €4K MRR. Not by aggressive marketing, but by solving a real problem and letting the education community do the talking.

## The Customer-Obsessed Phase

Instead of going crazy with more marketing, I went ALL IN on making sure my first customer had the best experience possible. I:
- Reached out personally
- Collaborated on features
- Gave them 3 months free

Crazy? Maybe. But it worked. Not only did they stay, they started referring other customers.

## Real Talk

Look, I know this might sound like one of those ""success stories"" that make you roll your eyes. But I'm just a kid who:
- Coded way too much Minecraft
- Refused to believe age was a limit
- Worked his ass off
- Got lucky sometimes
- Failed a bunch
- Kept going anyway

If you take anything from this post: Don't let anyone tell you you're too young, too inexperienced, or that you should ""wait until you're older."" That's BS.

Just start building. Start learning. Start doing.

## What’s Next ?
Since you guys seemed interested - I'm actually working on some cool stuff:

Content-wise: If you found this helpful, I'm planning to share:
* My exact technical stack breakdown
* How I handle pricing (made so many mistakes here lol)
* The complete guide of my outreach strategy
* My daily routine and productivity system

Let me know in the comments what you'd want me to cover first! I'll prioritize based on what's most useful to you guys.

Also working on detailed guides about specific parts of my journey (especially the Minecraft to SaaS transition since many asked).

Not sure if it's useful, but happy to do a proper breakdown of any of these topics if there's interest!

1hm18n9,https://www.reddit.com/r/ActingTraining/comments/1hm18n9/breaking_down_the_script_how_to_analyze_your/,Breaking Down the Script: How to Analyze Your Character,"When you're new to acting, breaking down a script and understanding your character can feel overwhelming. It’s like being handed a map but not knowing where to start. Don’t worry—every great actor started where you are. Analyzing a character is a skill that improves with practice, and this guide will walk you through the process step by step. 

**1. Start with the Basics: Who, What, Where, When, and Why** 

Begin by answering some foundational questions about your character: 

*Who* are they? Look at the character’s name, background, and relationships. 

*What* do they want? Every character has goals, whether small (getting a coffee) or monumental (saving the world). 

*Where* are they? The setting influences how your character behaves. A scene in a quiet library will feel different than one in a bustling city street. 

*When* does this happen? Time period and context matter. A character in a 1920s drama will move and speak differently than someone in a futuristic sci-fi. 

*Why* do they act the way they do? Understanding motivation is key. People act based on their desires, fears, and circumstances—your character is no different. 

**2. Read the Entire Script** 

Resist the urge to focus only on your lines. Read the full script to understand the story’s arc and your character’s place in it. Pay attention to how other characters describe yours, as this can reveal traits you may not see directly in your dialogue. 

**3. Dive Into the Subtext** 

The words on the page are just the surface. Subtext—what’s not being said—is often where the real story lies. For example, if a character says, “I’m fine,” but their actions or tone suggest otherwise, explore why they’re hiding their true feelings. 

**4. Build Your Character’s Backstory** 

Even if the script doesn’t provide much detail about your character’s past, you can fill in the blanks. Ask yourself: 

What was their childhood like? 

Have they faced any major life events? 

What do they fear most? 

You don’t need to share this backstory, but it helps create depth and authenticity in your performance. 

**5. Identify Objectives and Obstacles** 

Every scene has a purpose. Ask yourself: 

What does your character want in this scene? (Objective) 

What’s standing in their way? (Obstacle) 

For example, if your character is trying to apologize, the obstacle might be their own guilt or another character’s anger. Play the tension between these forces. 

 **6. Explore Relationships** 

How your character interacts with others will shape their behavior. Are they in love? In conflict? In awe? The emotions your character feels toward others will influence their tone, body language, and decisions. 

**7. Experiment with Physicality and Voice** 

Once you have a strong sense of your character’s inner life, think about how that translates outwardly: 

Does your character have a particular way of walking or standing? 

How do they use their hands when they talk? 

Is their voice soft and hesitant, or loud and commanding? 

These choices help bring your character to life. 

**8. Work with the Director and Cast** 

Acting is a collaborative process. Don’t be afraid to ask the director questions about your character or discuss relationships with your scene partners. Their input can offer fresh perspectives that enhance your understanding of the role. 

**9. Practice and Adjust** 

Don’t expect to get everything perfect on your first try. As you rehearse, you’ll discover new layers to your character. Be flexible and willing to refine your choices. 

**Final Thoughts** 

Breaking down a script is like solving a puzzle—each piece reveals a bit more about your character. By understanding their goals, motivations, and relationships, you’ll bring authenticity and depth to your performance. 

As you grow in your acting career, this process will become second nature. For now, embrace the learning curve and enjoy the journey of discovery. Every character you analyze is a step closer to mastering your craft. ",1,1735135284.0,ActingTraining,0,1.0,False

Can The King of Pop Shape Your Success as a Business Mom?,"https://preview.redd.it/nq3zu8qu8etd1.png?width=1784&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc5a7bd7df5051e732a073016b7e4fae0f50d25f

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

Izuku was walking the UA halls. He made it into the hero course fair and square and Bakugou wouldn't be able to do anything about it. Bakugou. There was 50/50 chance they'd be classmates again. He'll probably try to turn everyone against him, just like in middle school. The only way to prevent that from happening is to come clean. It's not like his quirk was still a secret anymore. Green head entered the room and internally cursed as he saw the ash blond boy in the classroom.

“Deku.” The boy got visibly angry.

“Bakugou.” Midoriya dismissively waved at him and got to his seat.

“I told you to…” Katsuki was interrupted by a jolly adult voice.

“Greetings, children!” A fat man in a black pants and orange hood entered through the door. “My name is Taishiro Toyomitsu. You most likely know me as BMI hero: Fatgum. I’ll be your homeroom teacher for these 3 years.”

“I am a fan of yours.” A tall girl with a spiky ponytail raised her hand. “May I get an autograph later?”

“Of course.” The hero nodded. “But first, let’s get to know each other better. Everyone will come to the board, state their name, show their quirk and tell some extra fact. I’ll go first.”

Toyomitsu walked up to the desk.

“My quirk is called \[Fat Absorption\]. It lets me stored a lot more fat than a regular person and used it as armor or to increase my strength.” He pulled a knife from his pocket and stabbed himself in the gut without any signs of pain on his face. “See? The fat absorbed the attack. My favorite food is Tokoyaki. Ok, any volunteers?”

Bakugou stood up and confidently approached the speaking position. He started rubbing his palms in preparation.

“I’m Katsuki Bakugou. You better remember it, extras. My quirk is called \[Explosion\]. The name is self explanatory.” He let out a small blast from his palm. “You see this? This is just a small portion of what’s to come. I was the top student at Aldera and I will be the best student here, so you better not stand in my way, especially if your quirk can’t stand on its own two legs.”

The crowd booed at an arrogant guy who didn’t even know what he is up against. Another blond boy got especially angry at the last statement. Little did he know, it wasn’t directed at him.

The tall girl from before gracefully walked towards her teacher, ready to impress her peers.

“Greetings, everybody. My name is Momo Yaoyorozu. My \[Creation\] allows me construct any non living object, as long as I know it’s chemical structure.” She put her hand forward and made a tiny matryoshka doll appear seemingly out of nowhere. “This toy the first thing I’ve ever created I always liked these things.” She put the thing on the teacher’s desk.

Eveyone started whispering among themselves about this quirk. Clearly it was more impressive than the last one.

“Can you make gold?” Another blond boy (how many of them are here?) asked.

“Of course, but…” She awkwardly pushed her index fingers against each other. “It wouldn’t be very good for the economy.”

The boy who asked the question giggled at the answer. He clearly didn’t find it satisfying.

Next was a girl with bright green hair. Something about her presence screamed high sense of enlightenment.

“Greetings. My name is Ibara Shiozaki. My quirk, \[Vine\], is tied to my hair.” Her hair grew out to carefully pick up the matryoshka doll. “As you can see I can control it quite well. I am firm believer in our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. If you seek salvation, do not hesitate to call upon me.” A strange light seemed to fall on her from nowhere.

*“Okay, that’s creepy.”* One of the students thought.

Another  student with blue hair and condescending smile walked to the stage.

“Name’s Romero Fujimi. Quirk’s \[Walk the Dinosaur\]. It lets me turn myself and other people into dinosaurs.” The boy’s left hand transformed into a reptilian one. His teeth got noticeably sharper. “I’ll crush everyone who stands in my way. Raar! Oh, and my favorite drink is coffee.”

*“Great, another poser.”* The red haired girl face palmed.

“Dude, where have you been all my life?” Another girl jumped in excitement. “Seeing a dinosaur is my dream, let alone becoming one!”

“I’ve been in a different prefecture, but I’ll make sure to show you, and everyone else, how great my quirk is!”

The boy cancelled his quirk one sat on his chair. He did not miss the angry scowl coming from Bakugou.

It was time for another green haired girl. Unlike Ibara, her presence was full of sass and confidence.

“Hi. I’m Setsuna Tokage. My quirk is \[Lizard Tail Splitter\].” Her hands and head got detached from the body and started to float on their own. Cool stuff, right?”

“Right.” Izuku murmured as he wrote down something in his notebook.

“I like dinosaurs.”

“Yeah, we get it.” The red haired girl said as she stood up for her turn.

“I’m Istuka Kednou. My quirk is called \[Big Fist\].” Her palms became massive in size. “It may not look like much but it’s effective. I’ve got a black belt in karate, so you should never underestimate me.” Proud of her claim, Itsuka left the board.

A boy with a bird head took his turn to make himself known.

“My name is Fumikage Tokoyami. My quirk’s name is…”

“\[Dark Shadow\]!” A strange being emerged from his body. It looked a very long shadow of a bird.

“Hi, everyone.”

“Hi/Hello.”

Everyone except one boy got surprised as they’ve never seen a sentient quirk before.

“I have so many questions.” Midoriya said.

*“So it’s the same type of quirk as mine? I guess I’m not that unique.”*

“I like to discover what fate has in store for me by using tarot cards.” Tokoyami hid DS and bowed down and walked back to his seat. Blond boy with sky blue eyes entered the stage in his stead.

“Hello. My name is Daigo Brando. My quirk is \[Holy Diver\].” A tall being looking like diver in a golden suit appeared behind him.

*“What a blasphemous name.”* Ibara thought.

“Hello.” The Diver waved at the audience.

“No way! A kindred spirit!” Dark Shadow jumped out, almost making the person in front of it fall.

“Dark Shadow, behave!”

“Awww.” The quirk went back into the host’s body.

“My apologies, Kendou.”

“Don’t sweat it.”

“Anyway…” Daigo continued. “Despite what you may think, we don’t like diving. We like cowboys.” He shot finger guns at his quirk, which fell in an overly dramatic fashion.

Next was a mutant girl with large horns over her head.

“Hi. It is hard to speak Japanese, I am sorry. My name is Pony Tsutonori. \[Horn Cannon\] is my quirk. I can shoot my horns.” The horns in question flew out of her head and started floating around, not to dissimilar from Tokage’s body parts. “I like anime.”

“Totally wicked.” A girl light brown hair gave thumb up.

“Wicked?” Pony was confused.

“That means cool, girl.”

“Cool as in cold? I’m sorry, I don’t understand.”

“Oh my gosh, I’ve gotta bring you up to speed later on.” The girl claimed as she went to present herself.

“Hi, guys. I’m Camie Utsushimi. My quirk is \[Glamour\]. It lets me create illusions.” She breathed a weird white mist from her mouth. Suddenly, there were two Camies.

“See? The first spoke.

“You think you’re seeing double.” The new one continued.

“But it’s all just a fleeting mirage.” The original put high fived her disappearing clone at sat down.

“Pfft. Your quirk is all smoke and mirrors.” Bakugo spat.

“I know. Cool, right?”

Next was a boy with heterochromia. There were only tiredness and boredom in his eyes.

“I am Shoto Todoroki. My quirk lets me produce ice. I’m not here to make friends so don’t even bother.” He went back immediately, without even trying to show his quirk.

*“Todoroki? I definitely heard that name before, but where?”* Izuku tried to remember.

*“Dynamite, dinosaur, now this guy. Hopefully the rest aren’t jerks.”* Kendou hoped for the best.

“Hello, my name is Tenya Iida. My quirk \[Engine\] lets me run at incredible speeds. I promise to show it later on. Now, I believe that people at this fine establishment should be at their best behavior.”

“That’s a fancy way of saying he’s a party pooper.” Setsuna’s mouth whispered to giggling Camie.

“Are you by any chance related to Ingenium?” Daigo wondered.

“Yes. He is brother. I didn’t feel like boasting about this, but since you’ve figured it out, I might as well say it. How did you know?”

“I saw him on TV without the helmet once. You just looked similar.”

“He-hey!” A girl dark brown hair awkwardly smiled. “My name is Ochako Uraraka. My \[Zero Gravity\] lets me remove gravitational pull from objects.” She took a pencil, threw it upwards and made it stick to the ceiling. She then cancelled the quirk and promptly caught the object. “I had quite a lot friends back in middle school, so I’m hoping it will be the same here.”

“Does your quirk work on gases?” Romero asked.

“Sadly, no.”

“Good, he he he.” He grinned in response.

Next was a boy with dark purple hair. He looked like he hasn’t slept well.

“My name is Hitoshi Shinsou. My quirk… I’ll show it later.” He looked at Tenya.

“We’ve got a shy one!”

“Whatever. I like cats.”

“Cats are demonic abominations.” Tokoyami whispered. “The way they look at me, eyes full of hunter’s savagery.”

The second last student was another blond, this time with grayish blue eyes.

“Greetings, my dear friends. I am Neito Monoma. I am quite a fan of theatrics. My quirk \[Copy\] does exactly what you think it does. Any volunteers?”

Ochako walked up and let him touch her hair. Neito was able to recreate the pencil trick from before.

“Despite what some presumptions cretins might say, quirk like mine have a lot of potential. Underestimate me at your peril.” He looked at angry ash blond.

Izuku couldn’t stall any longer. He knew that it was important to establish that he’s not a bad guy. With a sigh he grabbed two cards with photos of his parents. If he waits like Shinsou, Bakugou might already make a bad impression of him.

“Hello. My name is Izuku Midoriya. I like analyzing quirks. My quirk is…\[Collection\]. I can transfer people’s quirks into objects.”

“WHAT?!” Everyone bar Katsuki was shocked.

“That’s right. That bastard has to steal quirk to make himself useful.”

“No insults, young Bakugou.” Fatgum intervened. “Please, continue, young Midoriya.”

“Right. These cards contain quirks of my parents. Quirks that they gave WITH permission. You can take one of them and absorb the quirk. Anyone want to try?”

“Me! Me!” Utsushimi ran up and snatched of the cards. She felt weird energy moved from it into her body.

“That was my mom’s \[Attraction\]. Try taking another card with power of your mind.”

After a few minutes, Camie got the hang of her new quirk and took another card telekinetically. She tried absorbing the new quirk, but her body rejected it for some reason.

“Looks like your limit is two, just like mine. Your body rejects a quirk if it doesn’t think handle any more of them. Now, let me take \[Attraction\] back.” Green head grabbed his classmate with one hand and card with another. Camie felt her new quirk slipping away.

“Now, I imagine you have question?” Izuku asked his class.",1,1735134812.0,BokunoheroFanfiction,0,1.0,False

https://www.reddit.com/r/randonneuring/s/sMpTWHGevL


TPS is an annual fun event happening on 21st Dec every year. Second real participation. I did it once before but never completed.
This year, me, Matthieu and Annina decided to ride together.

You can start Winter solstice (Talvipäivänseisaus) anywhere you want. Minimum distance is 150 km and you can start counting kilometers by the time sunset on 21.12.2024 on your destination. You must reach your chosen finish by sunrise on Sunday 22.12.
A stop can take maximum of 2 hours and between stops and during last two hours before sunrise you must ride at least 15 km

We decided to get started from Helsinki, from Senaatintori and to go to Turku.
Sunset is at 15:12 and sunrise the next day at 9:36 That's more than 18 hours to complete a ride that usually would take about 9 hours during the summer.

The conditions were great for the first 180km, but from Salo to Turku, it was just rain rain rain for 4 hours.

We understood that one of the important pit stop of TPS was a Laavu (a campfire) in Liesjärvi. About half way through our ride. And we were received like kings and queens, with coffee, sausages, and a pipari with our names on them.

We were REALLY hoping to find friends to join us for the second stretch to Turku, but we were disappointed to understand everyone coming from Helsinki was going to Tampere instead. Next time, we know. Everyone was giving the same reason. Connections from Turku to Helsinki are scarce. You need to book a train ticket with a bike place and there are just 4 spots per train. Whereas it's super easy from Tampere as you can just jump on a regional train without reservation.

We made it to Turku at 9:00! We had a quick sauna and huge breakfast, we waited for the train ride a few hours later to take us back to Helsinki.

About the freezing water in the bottles, I decided not to worry too much because the temperature wouldn't be that bad. -6 the lowest and only for a few hours. It was a bit of a struggle to drink but it was OK. 
I tried taping a toe warmer pad to one of the bottles and that did strictly nothing. 
My friend Mat, who's a trail runner had his camelback on his back under his jacket and it was perfect for multiple reasons.
He could drink whenever he wanted and however much he wanted. 
But I couldn't because it was really tough to lift my hands from the handlebar with the kinds of conditions we had. 
Most roads were great but every now and then it would be super slippery full of patches of ice. 
We were riding with winter tyres with studs but it still makes the riding difficult especially when it lasts 18hours.

***Photo above*** *- do you know how to spell ""ubiquitous""?*  
  
Unions are ecstatic. There are now (possibly, up to) 300 Starbucks locations that have joined the strike. But for context, let’s note that the chain has 33,000 stores, so less than 1% are involved. (see link below)  
  
Before you say “I fail to see the threat”, let’s also note that - like 2008 – corporate America seems to be wandering into failure and bankruptcy. I won’t provide a full list of chains that went BKO or closed this year. There would be hundreds. But a few of the household names include CVS drugs, Walgreens drugs, Red Lobster, The Container Store, Burger King (!), TGI Friday's restaurants, Spirit Airlines, Bed Bath and Beyond, Family Dollar. . .  
  
On the watch list to soon file chapter 11, based on final assessment of Christmas sales: JC Penney, Rite Aid drugs, Footlocker, Lowes . . . If you doubt any of these names are in trouble, then reply below and tell us what Xmas shopping you did at JC Penney or Lowes. The JC Penney closest to my home has 2 entrances blocked, to save money on security guards.  
  
Starbucks isn’t on the imminent bankruptcy list. But I’m not buying their stock on the dip (shares are down 10% over the past week).  
  
How much does a Starbucks barista actually make? $17 an hour (national average). Probably more in Hollywood or Manhattan, less in West Virginia.  
  
What should Starbucks’ new CEO do? Andrew Nicol has only been on the job 3 months, but he DID save his former employer (Chipotle) from bankruptcy after scandals involving entrees made with horsemeat, child labor law violations, and food poisoning. So if Starbucks' strikers have similar grievances, Mr. Nicol may have relevant experience.  
  
But the sad truth is that there are just WAAAY too many Starbucks. 33,000 worldwide. 16,000 in the USA alone. That’s quite a bit more than the number of McDonalds, A place where you can get a burger and fries with your coffee. We have too many burger places also. So, some closures might be in Starbucks future. If their CEO asked consultants for advice, this is probably what he’d hear:  


**Close duplicate stores in shopping malls**. Those malls are dying anyway. If you have 2 stores in a mall, close the one furthest from the entrance.

**Same deal with multiple stores on a city block.** Keep the one closest to the corner.

**Cull underperforming staff**. This might be the easiest. You CAN fire strikers if they have past performance issues. Chronic absenteeism. Substance abuse while on the clock. Fake slip and fall claims. Inventory shrinkage. Cursing out customers.

**Overeducated and overprivileged.** I’d expand the herd culling to include people with college degrees like philosophy, art history, French literature, political science, ethnic studies, social services, and cultural anthropology (my own college minor). People who wasted tens of thousands on useless degrees are among the most disconnected from reality, and least appreciative of their $17 hourly starting salary. Hey folks . . . this is indoor work with no heavy lifting. If baristas insist that they need more money, remind them Amazon is hiring pickers at $22 an hour.

It's painful to admit, but America has too many coffee shops. Idle fast food drive throughs. Dying malls in the suburbs. Even big box stores are on the brink. I went to Best Buy for some last-minute shopping yesterday. They had chain saws and leaf blowers for sale, front and center, next to the $2,500 OLED big screen TVs. Yikes . . . better start looking over your shoulder, Lowes!  
  
I’m just sayin’ . . .

We use an Oscar Simonelli 2. The problem is the final double espresso shot is way too small - weighing maybe 12 grams!! We brew on 18 grams of beans

The shot starts pouring way at 25 seconds. 

When pulling a shot without coffee, the shot pulls normally - any ideas to fixing the problem? 

The shot is also maybe too cold, we warm the glasses beforehand as well

We have tried different grinding sizes, different tamping pressures
We use high quality beans, so that’s shouldn’t be a problem.

My project is currently at over 2,600 users and 80 active paying customers after about two and a half months since launching, so today I’ll tell you how I got my first users and hopefully it can be of help to you on your journey.

So this is exactly how we did it, without spending a dollar.

**I'll try to be as concise as possible because I know reading a wall of text is boring.**

I'll start from the beginning:

How did we come up with our idea?

We experienced a problem ourselves that we wanted to solve.

After a few days of market research, head-scratching, and coffee drinking, an idea for a solution began to take shape.

To see if others experienced the problem and if there was interest in our solution, we created a survey and shared it on our target audience's subreddit.

The survey questions were:

1. *Do you build businesses?*
2. *How do you currently manage your startup/project building process? (do you use AI?, where do you keep notes?, etc)*
3. *What are the biggest challenges you face when building your business?*
4. *How valuable would you find an AI assistant that knows your project and provides actionable steps throughout the process of building it?*
5. *What features would you consider most important in a platform like Buildpad?*
6. *On a scale of 1-10, how likely would you be to use a platform like Buildpad?*
7. *What concerns or reservations might you have about using such a platform?*
8. *How much would you be willing to pay for a service like this?*

To get responses we made sure to offer them feedback on their project in return.

**You have to give something to get something.**

This can take a few tries so if you don't get many responses > improve post and try again.

We got positive feedback on the idea so we built the MVP.

About 30 days later it was finished.

To get our first users for it we:

* Shared the MVP to the survey participants
* Did a launch post on their subreddit

The results..

* First 3 users now!

Not bad.

We need more.

So we..

Kept posting in communities of our target audience for two weeks

* Daily posts in the Build in Public community on X
* Every other day in r/indiehackers, SaaS, and SideProject on Reddit

These were posts talking about subjects related to our project and would often end with mentioning our product.

Our total users after two weeks..

**+100 new users**

That’s amazing! We had never had that many users even after months of working on our previous two projects.

This approach:

* Didn't take too much time.
* Didn't take too much effort.
* Didn't cost any money.

You can do it too if you apply yourself.

At this point you've got an MVP and you have your first users. Now all you do is get as much feedback as possible and improve your product.

All the time we've spent improving our product based on user feedback has definitely made marketing easier for us, so I highly recommend it!

Please, if anyone’s out there, if anyone’s seeing this—I need to know I’m not alone. Is anyone else experiencing this? Has anyone else seen the fog? Please, for the love of God, respond if you can.

My name’s Evan. I live alone in a small suburban neighborhood—the kind where every house looks the same, the lawns are perfectly trimmed, and nothing exciting ever happens. It’s one of those places where every street is like a mirror image of the last, with rows of houses painted in bland colors and identical mailboxes lined up like soldiers. It’s quiet here. The kind of quiet some people find peaceful, but I’ve always found unnerving—like the silence is just waiting for something to happen.

Until today, nothing ever did.

This morning, I woke up to the buzzing of my phone on the nightstand beside my bed. At first, I thought it was some spam call or maybe a notification about a package I’d forgotten I ordered. The sound was sharp and grating, cutting through the stillness of my room like a knife. I groggily reached out, squinting at the screen through sleep-blurred eyes, expecting to just dismiss it and roll over for a few more minutes of sleep.

But when I saw the screen, I froze. It wasn’t showing the usual caller ID or some meaningless notification. No, it was an emergency alert, bold and impossible to ignore.

At first, I couldn’t make sense of it. My brain was still foggy from sleep, and the words seemed to blur together as my eyes tried to focus. Slowly, I sat up, my heart beginning to race as the reality of what I was reading sank in. I read it again, and again, like somehow the second or third time would make it less terrifying.

My heart pounded harder as I swung my legs over the side of the bed and stood up. My knees felt shaky under me, like they might give out at any moment. The room felt unnaturally cold, the chill creeping into my skin. Something felt wrong, like I was already in the middle of something I didn’t fully understand. My breath quickened as I reached for the curtain, the tips of my fingers brushing the fabric before pulling it back just enough to peek outside.

What I saw made my stomach twist. The street, which normally looked so ordinary, so predictable, was now blanketed in a thick, heavy fog. It wasn’t the kind of light, wispy mist you might see on a calm morning. This was different. It was dense, almost alive, clinging to everything around it. I could barely make out the shapes of the houses across the street, their familiar outlines distorted and hazy in the gloom.

The silence outside was deafening. No birds. No cars passing by. The usual hum of distant traffic was completely gone. It was like the entire world had just stopped, swallowed up by the fog. The air itself looked thick, suffocating. I almost felt like it was pressing in on me, right through the window.

I stared into the eerie stillness, my heart pounding harder in my chest. My mind was racing with questions—What the hell was this fog? Where did it come from? And why did it feel so wrong? I pulled the curtain shut quickly, stepping away from the window as a cold sweat broke out on my forehead. I felt trapped, cornered in my own house by something I couldn’t explain.

My phone buzzed again in my hand, snapping me out of my thoughts. I fumbled to unlock it, my fingers shaking so badly it took me a few tries. The screen lit up again with that same emergency alert:

>**URGENT WARNING:** Do not leave your home. Barricade all doors and windows. Keep food and water stock ready. Do not make noise. Stay silent. Stay inside. They are drawn to sound.

At first, I thought it was a glitch or some kind of prank. I checked the time: 7:42 AM. The green glow of the digital clock on my nightstand seemed sharper than usual in the dim light of the room. The house was unusually quiet, even for my neighborhood.

The floorboards creaked softly under my weight. That small, familiar sound felt out of place in the silence. I rubbed my eyes, trying to shake off the grogginess, and made my way to the kitchen. The air inside the house felt strangely still, almost heavy, but I brushed it off.

I reached for the coffee maker, grabbed the pot, and filled the reservoir with water. The sound of it splashing felt unnervingly loud in the quiet. I flicked the switch to start brewing and stood there for a moment, staring at the counter. I reached for my phone, scrolling through my contacts. First, I tried my parents—straight to voicemail. My sister—same. I frowned, trying a couple of friends, but the calls didn’t even go through. Just dead air.

I glanced at the corner of the screen. No signal. That didn’t make sense. I moved to the window, holding my phone higher, like that would somehow help. Still nothing. My Wi-Fi should’ve been working at least. I turned toward the living room, my footsteps echoing slightly as I walked.

The router’s lights were frozen, no blinking, no connection. I crouched down and unplugged it, waiting a few seconds before plugging it back in. The lights came back on, but they were still static, no change. No connection.

That was weird. Kind of unsettling, actually. I stood up, stretching my neck, and glanced around the room. My eyes landed on the living room window, and I froze.

Outside, the thick gray fog still blanketed everything. I couldn’t see much beyond it—just a dense wall of mist. I turned on the TV, hoping for some kind of explanation, something to make sense of it. The screen flickered to life, a soft hiss of static filling the air, and then a single line of text began to scroll across every channel:

>**WARNING:** Stay indoors. Do not go outside. Remain silent. They are listening.

The message repeated, unchanging, as if locked in an infinite loop.

I stared at the screen, my pulse pounding in my ears. The words felt oppressive, heavy with an urgency I couldn’t understand. My hands trembled slightly as I fumbled for the remote, trying another channel.

The same message. Over and over.

No explanation. No updates. Just that.

I locked the front door, double-checked the bolt, and decided to take a look from upstairs. Maybe I’d spot something that made sense, or at least something familiar. The house felt off, but I couldn’t quite figure out why. I slowly made my way up the stairs, each step creaking underfoot as I went. The silence seemed to press in on me more the higher I got, and I felt a little colder with each step.

When I reached the second-floor window, I couldn’t believe what I saw. The fog was worse up here, almost suffocating. It stretched out in every direction, thick and heavy, so dense I couldn’t even see the house across the street. Just a vast, gray nothing. The world outside felt like it had disappeared.

I stared for a moment, hoping the fog would shift, maybe clear just enough for me to make sense of things. But it didn’t. The longer I stood there, the more unsettling it felt. It was like the whole world had just stopped.

And then, I remembered Max. He sleeps in the backyard at night, usually tied to his chain because he’s a little too good at escaping. My stomach sank, suddenly full of dread. I rushed downstairs without even thinking, my heart beating faster. When I opened the back door, the first thing I noticed was the chain—it was broken. Snapped clean through, the metal bent and twisted like something had yanked it with unbelievable force.

Max was gone.

I called his name, my voice a little too loud in the dead silence. “Max! Max, come on, boy!” The words felt strange, like they didn’t belong. The silence around me swallowed them whole. No barking. No paw steps. Nothing.

I called again, louder this time. “Max!” My stomach twisted as I stepped further out into the yard, hoping to see him running back, wagging his tail. But there was nothing. Just the cold, gray fog and the stillness. I stood there for a second, my chest tightening, not quite believing what I was seeing. This couldn’t be happening.

I quickly rushed back inside, slamming the door shut behind me. I locked it, bolted it, my hands shaking as I tried to make sure it was secure. The silence inside the house felt just as wrong as it did outside. I ran upstairs again, my legs almost moving on their own. I didn’t want to check the window, didn’t want to confirm what I already feared, but I had to.

I pulled the curtain back, half-expecting to see him standing there in the yard, shaking the fog off his fur. But the fog was still thick, swirling in every direction, and the yard was empty. No sign of him anywhere. Just that endless gray.

I stood there, staring out, feeling like the air was closing in around me. The world felt so far away, like it didn’t exist anymore.

That’s when I saw it.

Something was out there, in my backyard. At first, I thought I was seeing things—like my brain was still half asleep or something, but no. The shape was all wrong. Too long. Too thin. It was crawling on all fours, moving with this awful, jerky kind of motion, like its joints weren’t working properly—like a puppet with tangled strings.

I felt this tightness in my chest, my breath coming faster, and I couldn’t stop watching it. It paused, sniffing the ground in a way that felt too deliberate, like it was looking for something. Oh god I hope that something wasn't me. I felt a cold sweat break out on my skin, and my legs went completely numb. I tried to stay still, to stay quiet, but it was like every part of me was screaming to move, to do anything to get away.

Then, it turned. Slowly. Too slowly. Its head snapped in my direction, and my heart slammed in my chest. I could barely hear anything over the sound of my own pulse, but I could still make out the scraping of its claws on the ground as it started moving toward the back door.

I held my breath.

It crept up the patio steps, its limbs twisting in ways that didn’t look right—unnatural. Every scrape got louder, closer. And then it was there, pressed up against the door, its body flat against the wood. The scraping sound, now unmistakable, as it tested the handle. My stomach twisted in on itself, and I swear I could feel the blood drain from my face. I kept thinking, *Please, please hold. Please stay locked.* My fingers dug into the windowsill, knuckles aching, but I still couldn’t move.

I couldn’t breathe.

Then, after what felt like hours, the scraping stopped. The silence after was almost worse. It was just me, my pulse thundering in my ears, and the feeling that I was being watched. I didn’t know what to do. I was frozen in place, like my body was too terrified to obey me.

Then it tilted its head, almost like it was listening. My breath caught in my throat.

And then… it scratched. Once. Twice.

It wasn’t trying to break in—not yet. But there was something so wrong about the way it did it, like it was curious, or maybe trying to figure something out. And the worst part? It wasn’t just trying to get inside—it was studying me. Watching me. Waiting.

I backed away from the window, my legs shaking, but I couldn’t look away from the door. Every instinct in me screamed to run, to do something, but I was paralyzed by fear, stuck in place, like my body had given up on me.

A loud bang echoed down the street—like a car door slamming or maybe a window shattering. The creature froze, its head snapping toward the noise. And then, without warning, it darted off into the fog, moving so fast it made my stomach drop. I’ve never seen anything move like that—human or animal. It was… unnatural. Like something out of a nightmare.

It was like it didn’t even need to think. One second, it was there, pressing against the door, and the next, it was just gone—vanishing into the fog like it was never even real. My heart was still racing as I tried to process what had just happened. My brain couldn’t keep up with the reality of it. I was stuck, frozen, not able to do anything but stare.

And then the silence was shattered. The screams came. Blood-curdling, agonized screams that seemed to slice through the fog like a blade. At first, they sounded far away, almost like they weren’t real. But then, they grew louder, closer. And the dread—*that* dread—settled deep into my bones. It was like something was hunting, something out there was searching for… whatever it could find.

I could feel the panic rising in my chest, my body completely locked in place. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t even breathe properly. All I could do was listen as those screams grew closer. The fog seemed to be closing in with it, suffocating everything. It was like the entire street was alive with terror, pressing down on me. I wanted to run. I should’ve run. But I couldn’t. I was completely paralyzed.

Now, I’m back in my room. I’ve barricaded the door with a dresser. I’ve started writing this. I’ve been huddled in my bed, shivering under the blankets, trying to stay as quiet as possible. I’ve been scrolling through my phone, checking if any apps work—just trying to do *something*. Reddit actually did load. It took a while, a good few minutes, but it finally popped up. I can’t even explain the relief I felt just seeing it. It’s the only sign of anything resembling normalcy I’ve had in hours. The rest of my phone is useless, but somehow, this worked. I don’t know if it’s a good sign or just another strange thing about all this, but for now, I’m holding onto it.. I don’t know what’s happening, or what’s out there, but I’m terrified. I can’t stop shaking.

And Max… God, Max. If you’re out there, I’m so sorry, buddy. I don’t think I can come for you. I wish I could. But everything feels so wrong now. I don’t even know if it’s safe to go outside anymore. Hell, I don’t even know if I’ll ever be able to again.

Please, someone. Anyone. Please respond. Please, I can’t be the only one seeing this, stuck in this nightmare. There has to be someone else out there. Please. I need to know I’m not alone. Please.

I’ll try to post an update if the fog clears or if help shows up. If you don’t hear from me, it means whatever that thing is came back and got in.",2,1735133838.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

1hm0s74,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_CoinsHome/comments/1hm0s74/flexa_and_nighthawk_wallet_unite_to_power/,Flexa and Nighthawk Wallet unite to power everyday crypto payments,"Flexa and Nighthawk Wallet Revolutionizing Everyday Crypto Payments

In a significant step forward for the use of digital currencies in everyday commerce, Flexa, a leading provider of digital payment solutions, has partnered with Nighthawk Wallet, a self-custody digital wallet. This collaboration aims to make using digital assets, such as cryptocurrencies, simpler, faster, and more secure for both consumers and merchants. 😃

What are Flexa and Nighthawk Wallet?

- Flexa: Founded in 2018, Flexa specializes in creating tools for businesses to accept and process digital payments. Their platform allows merchants to accept digital assets like cryptocurrencies across various channels, ensuring instant authorization, complete fraud resistance, and flexible payouts.

- Nighthawk Wallet: This digital wallet allows users to manage and spend their digital assets securely. It is designed with a focus on privacy and control, enabling users to conduct seamless transactions while safeguarding their sensitive information.

How Does the Integration Work?

The partnership between Flexa and Nighthawk Wallet integrates Flexa's payment technology into the Nighthawk Wallet app. Here’s how it works:

- User Experience: Users of the Nighthawk Wallet can now make instant payments using their digital assets at over 41,000 retail locations across the United States and Canada. This includes places like restaurants, coffee shops, and other merchants.

- Payment Process: When a user wants to make a payment, they use the Nighthawk Wallet app, which now includes Flexa Components. These components ensure that transactions are processed quickly, privately, and securely. The user simply needs to open the app, select the amount to pay, and use the QR code or wallet address of the merchant to complete the transaction. 💸

- Merchant Benefits: For merchants, this integration offers several advantages. It provides guaranteed settlement of payments, meaning the merchant receives the funds immediately without the risk of chargebacks. Chargebacks are when a customer disputes a transaction, and the merchant has to return the funds. With Flexa and Nighthawk Wallet, this risk is eliminated, making the payment process more secure and efficient for businesses.

Key Features and Benefits

- Speed and Efficiency: Transactions are processed instantly, reducing the time it takes to complete a payment. This makes the experience similar to or even better than traditional credit card payments.

- Privacy and Security: The integration emphasizes privacy and security. Users' sensitive information is safeguarded, and the transactions are fraud-resistant, ensuring that both the consumer and the merchant are protected. 🔒

- Accessibility: This partnership expands the use of digital currencies in everyday life. Users can now spend their digital assets like ZEC (Zcash, a type of cryptocurrency) for in-person purchases, making digital currencies more practical for daily use.

Challenges and Future Outlook

Despite the advancements, there are still challenges to widespread adoption of cryptocurrency payments. Here are some of the key issues:

- Volatility: Cryptocurrencies can be highly volatile, meaning their prices can fluctuate rapidly. This can complicate transactions and affect profitability for both merchants and consumers. 📉

- Regulatory Uncertainty: There is still a lack of clear guidelines on the regulation and taxation of cryptocurrencies in many countries, including the US and Canada. This uncertainty can make businesses hesitant to adopt crypto payment solutions.

- Technical Barriers: Integrating crypto payment systems can be complex, and there are concerns about transaction speed and scalability. However, innovations like the Flexa and Nighthawk Wallet partnership are working to address these issues.

Growing Adoption

Despite these challenges, the adoption of cryptocurrency payments is growing. A recent study by Deloitte found that nearly 75% of US retailers plan to accept cryptocurrency payments within the next two years. Major retailers such as Whole Foods, Starbucks, and Newegg have already integrated cryptocurrency payment options, further legitimizing digital assets in the retail space. 📈

Conclusion

The collaboration between Flexa and Nighthawk Wallet marks a significant step towards mainstream acceptance of digital currencies. By making payments faster, more secure, and more accessible, this integration paves the way for a future where digital currencies are seamlessly integrated into the global economy. As technology continues to evolve and address the existing challenges, we can expect to see even more widespread adoption of cryptocurrency payments in everyday commerce. 🌐

But then I asked if I could share my side, and she let me use her phone to post. She’s getting ready to head to my parents’ place for Christmas day, and I’m bored, so here I am.

She can’t just leave a task for later—it’s not in her nature. I told her I’d shovel soon, but she wanted it done immediately. I get it, before 8 AM and all that, but we still had time. She kept reminding me, and finally, I said, “If you’re in such a rush, you can do it. I’d actually be grateful.” She said okay.

Yes, I forgot to make her coffee and toast, but I would’ve done it if she had just sat down and chilled. She didn’t. She wanted everything done now, like usual.

Also, I’ve been diagnosed with depression and anxiety and have been on meds since July—right around when I started working with a new team. My sleep schedule is a mess, and I was tired.

To everyone suggesting “exit plans,” thanks, but we talked it out. We both apologized. I said sorry for letting her down, and she promised not to shovel anymore. She also apologized for yelling at me and calling me a selfish, lazy prick.

An older man who I thought I was attracted to, I contacted him after I thought there was a mutual interest. 

He said he should be free all weekend. 

Saturday at 6 he asked to meet at 11. I was at an early morning sunrise swim. 

I asked to rearrange and he said no just leave it. 
I said i could be back for 11, no just leave it. 

Then I bumped into him and the look he gave me was of, an angry looking down. 

I didnt reject him...

Next time we bumped in, sat down. An older woman sat down gleaming all over him. He took the attraction. 

I saw a friend and got up to say hello. Rescued really...

Woman left, he got up, I introduced them. I Forgot other friends name and this guy said 'old age' directing it to me. 
Didnt even say hello to other friend. 

Next time we bumped in, he bought coffee with tokens. Left and said  'are you sitting there waiting for me to buy you coffee'


Always talked over me, If I started a sentance he banged in and talked relentlessly. 

I kept away for a year. I didnt like how I felt around him given all that. 

Easter this year he came into a cafe I go to.

We spoke for the first time, or, I actually felt he gave me the time to talk. Spoke about women, his ex, concealing his phone and talking about things id said, mentioned before. 

I literally do not trust a man who witnessed female competition, and made me feel like shit for it.  

Its really affected my wellbeing, and social standing as I reacted really badly by calling him an abuser. 

I grasped that there was a rejection to taken, and then I was made to feel bad because of that. 

His social circle have turned against me, in my own home town. He isnt from here. 

Im wary of keeping this post here but I need guidance please. 

Am I right for perceiving what I have correctly?

---------------------------------------------------------------

Water is essential for life, but many people overlook how hydration levels can significantly impact overall health and wellness. Understanding the importance of proper hydration is crucial for maintaining your body’s functions and boosting your well-being.

Firstly, hydration plays a vital role in maintaining your body's temperature. When you're well-hydrated, your body can regulate its temperature more effectively. On a hot day or during intense exercise, water helps to cool the body down by producing sweat, which evaporates and keeps your core temperature within a healthy range.

Moreover, proper hydration supports your cardiovascular health. When you're sufficiently hydrated, blood volume increases, allowing the heart to pump blood more easily. This can lower your heart rate and reduce the strain on your heart during physical activity. Conversely, dehydration can lead to thicker blood, which forces your heart to work harder, increasing the risk of cardiovascular issues.

If you’re looking to improve your cognitive functions, consider how hydration influences your brain health. Studies show that even mild dehydration can affect your mood, memory, and overall cognitive performance. When you experience dehydration, you may find it challenging to concentrate or feel more fatigued. Keeping hydrated ensures that your brain operates at its best, allowing you to think clearly and stay focused throughout the day.

Hydration also has a significant impact on your digestive system. Sufficient water intake helps move food through your intestines and prevents constipation. When your body is well-hydrated, it can break down food properly and absorb nutrients more effectively. This means that drinking enough water contributes to better nutrient absorption, translating into improved energy levels and overall well-being.

In terms of skin health, staying hydrated ensures your skin remains supple and resilient. Dehydration can lead to dry skin, which may cause premature aging and increase the risk of skin conditions. By drinking adequate amounts of water, you help to maintain your skin's elasticity and give it a youthful glow. Hydrated skin can also better shield itself against environmental stressors.

- **Key Factors Influencing Hydration:**
    - Activity Level: More active individuals require more water.
    - Climate: Hot or humid weather increases your need for hydration.
    - Health Status: Certain conditions can affect how much water you need.
    - Diet: High-sodium or sugary foods can increase your thirst.

For proper hydration, the commonly referenced guideline is to drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water daily, but this may vary depending on individual needs. Keep in mind that drinking enough water is not solely about chugging down glasses; it includes all the fluids you consume. Foods with high water content, like fruits and vegetables, also contribute to your hydration levels. Foods such as watermelon, cucumbers, and oranges can effectively help you stay hydrated.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
To encourage better hydration practices, consider these practical steps:

- Carry a reusable water bottle to easily track your intake throughout the day.
- Set reminders on your phone to drink water regularly if you tend to forget.
- Infuse your water with fruits or herbs for added flavor and inspiration to stay hydrated.
- Drink a glass of water before each meal to incorporate hydration into your routine.

Listening to your body is essential for maintaining proper hydration levels. Thirst is a natural indicator that you need more fluids. In addition, paying attention to your urine color can guide you on your hydration status; ideally, it should be light yellow. If it's darker, it's a sign you may need to drink more water.

Ultimately, how hydration levels influence your overall health and wellness cannot be overstated. From regulating body temperature to supporting cognitive function and maintaining skin health, staying hydrated plays a crucial role in creating a healthier lifestyle. By prioritizing hydration, you can boost your overall wellness and function at your best each day.

Common Hydration Myths Debunked for Better Health Choices
---------------------------------------------------------

Water is essential for our survival and overall health. However, there are many myths surrounding hydration that can lead to confusion about how much is truly needed for optimal wellness. By debunking these common hydration myths, you can make well-informed choices to improve your health.

### Myth 1: You Need to Drink Eight Glasses of Water a Day

One of the most persistent hydration myths is that everyone should drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water daily. While staying hydrated is crucial, the amount of water needed varies from person to person. Factors such as age, weight, activity level, and climate all play a role in determining how much water you should drink. Instead of counting glasses, listen to your body. Thirst is a natural indicator of when you need to hydrate.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Myth 2: Thirst Means You Are Already Dehydrated

Many believe that if you feel thirsty, it's a sign that you're already dehydrated. In reality, thirst is your body’s way of signaling that it needs more fluid. While waiting until you're thirsty to drink may not be ideal for athletes or people in hot climates, it's vital to recognize thirst as a normal bodily function rather than a first warning sign of dehydration.

### Myth 3: All Fluids Are Equivalent to Water

Some people think that all drinks count as hydration. While beverages like tea, coffee, and juices do contribute to your fluid intake, they often contain sugars or caffeine, which can have diuretic effects. Water remains the best choice for staying hydrated. To maximize hydration, aim to make water the primary source of your fluids.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Myth 4: You Can Rely on Food for Hydration

It's true that many foods, especially fruits and vegetables, contain water and can aid your hydration. However, they shouldn’t be your lone source of fluid. Foods typically provide only about 20% of your daily hydration needs. For the best health outcomes, combine food sources with adequate water intake.

### Myth 5: Drinking Water Before Meals Will Ruin Your Appetite

Some people avoid drinking water before meals for fear it will diminish their appetite. In fact, drinking water prior to your meal may help with portion control. It can fill you up slightly, leading to healthier portion sizes and reduced calorie intake. Just be mindful not to consume too much water that you feel uncomfortable while eating.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Myth 6: Clear Urine Means You’re Perfectly Hydrated

While clear urine can be a good indicator of hydration, it’s not the only measure. Factors like diet, medications, and overall health can affect urine color. A light straw or pale yellow color typically indicates proper hydration levels. If your urine is dark yellow, it may mean you need to drink more fluids.

### Myth 7: You Can't Over-Hydrate

Many think that you can drink as much water as you want with no consequences. However, over-hydration is possible and can lead to a condition called hyponatremia, where sodium levels in your blood become dangerously low. This is particularly a risk for endurance athletes. It’s important to balance your water intake according to your activity levels and environmental conditions.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Myth 8: Cold Water is Bad for Digestion

Some believe that drinking cold water can negatively impact digestion. This belief lacks scientific backing. Cold water can be refreshing and, for many, promotes better hydration. It’s worth noting that what matters most is getting enough water—whether it’s cold, warm, or at room temperature.

### Practical Tips for Staying Hydrated

- Carry a reusable water bottle to help track your intake.
- Set reminders on your phone to drink water throughout the day.
- Add slices of fruits like lemon or cucumber to enhance the flavor of your water.
- Pay attention to your body’s signals; if you feel thirsty, drink!

Understanding hydration is vital for maintaining good health. By debunking these common myths, you can better navigate your hydration needs and make choices that optimize your health and wellness. Drinking the right amount of water can lead to improved energy, better digestion, and overall enhanced well-being.

Understanding the Impact of Dehydration on Physical and Mental Performance
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dehydration can sneak up on you, often without you even realizing it. It affects everyone, from athletes to busy professionals, and its impact on both physical and mental performance can be significant. Understanding how dehydration influences your body and mind can help you make better choices about your hydration habits.

### Signs of Dehydration

Recognizing the signs of dehydration is crucial. Some common symptoms include:

- Thirst
- Dry mouth
- Fatigue
- Weakness
- Headaches
- Dizziness or light-headedness
- Dark-colored urine

If you notice any of these signs, it’s essential to take action and hydrate immediately.

### How Dehydration Affects Physical Performance

Physical performance can suffer dramatically due to dehydration. When you are low on fluids, even mild dehydration can lead to various problems:

- **Reduced endurance:** Studies show that a loss of just 1-2% of body weight due to dehydration can impair endurance activities, making your workouts feel much harder.
- **Decreased strength:** Dehydration can affect your muscle strength, leading to reduced power during activities like weight lifting or sprinting.
- **Increased risk of heat-related illnesses:** Adequate hydration helps regulate body temperature. Without it, your chances of experiencing heat exhaustion or heat stroke increase.
- **Longer recovery times:** When you are dehydrated, your muscles take longer to recover after exercise, impacting your training routine.

These factors can ultimately derail your fitness goals and make it challenging to maintain an active lifestyle.

### Impact on Mental Performance

Dehydration doesn’t just impact your body; it also takes a toll on your brain. Consider the following effects:

- **Impaired concentration:** Studies have shown that dehydration can lead to difficulties in focusing, making tasks feel frustratingly difficult.
- **Decreased short-term memory:** Your ability to retain information can be compromised. This is especially problematic in situations where memory recall is essential, such as studying for exams or performing at work.
- **Increased mood swings:** Dehydration can lead to irritability, anxiety, and stress. Staying properly hydrated can help maintain a stable mood.
- **Slower reaction times:** Just like your physical performance, your reaction time can slow down when you are dehydrated. This is critical for activities that require quick thinking and decision-making, such as driving or playing sports.

### Prevention and Hydration Tips

The good news is that staying hydrated is relatively straightforward. Here are some helpful tips to ensure you drink enough water:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Follow the 8x8 rule:** Aim for eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day. This is a good baseline for most people.
- **Listen to your body:** Pay attention to your thirst and drink before you get thirsty.
- **Choose water-rich foods:** fruits and vegetables with high water content, like cucumbers, oranges, and watermelon, can help boost your hydration.
- **Set reminders:** Use your phone or smart devices to set reminders if you often forget to drink.


Understanding the impact of dehydration on both physical and mental performance is vital for anyone looking to maintain their health and wellness. By recognizing the signs and implementing effective hydration strategies, you can significantly boost your energy levels, mental clarity, and overall quality of life. Don’t underestimate the power of hydration; it may very well transform your health.

### Conclusion

Understanding how much water you should drink and its transformative effect on your health is vital for achieving optimal wellness. Hydration levels play a crucial role in how you feel physically and mentally. Maintaining the right amount of water supports bodily functions, enhances energy levels, and boosts cognitive performance. When you grasp the science behind water consumption, it becomes clear just how essential hydration is for health.

By incorporating practical tips into your daily routine, such as carrying a reusable water bottle or setting reminders to drink water, you can easily meet your hydration needs. Remember, debunking common hydration myths—like the notion that all fluids count equally—can empower you to make better choices about what you drink.

Growing up, it was just me and my mom. She’s always been my rock. My dad left when I was little, and we’ve been figuring things out on our own ever since. But last year, everything changed when my mom got really sick. She had to stop working, and suddenly I had to step up to keep us afloat.

I took a part-time job at a coffee shop to help with bills, but it’s been overwhelming. Between school, work, and taking care of her, there are days I feel like I’m barely holding it together. My job is also toxic, with rude coworkers and customers that make it even harder. But we need the money, so I keep pushing through.

The one thing that helps me escape is my art. I’ve always loved drawing, and a few months ago, I started sharing my designs online. To my surprise, people actually loved them and even commissioned me. It’s been one of the only bright spots in my life lately.

Now, I’m at a crossroads. Do I keep working a job that’s draining me just to survive, or take a chance and focus on building my art into something more? I feel stuck, but I’m trying to stay hopeful.

So, it was my Christmas overnight shift, and let me tell you, it was something else. I walked in at 11:45 PM, and the store was an absolute disaster. Packed with people, shelves a mess—it looked like Santa’s workshop exploded, but instead of toys, it was chaos and complaints.

The real star of the night? This lady. She struts up to the counter and asks for whipped cream. Spoiler alert: we didn’t have any. She then grabs a small coffee and three donuts, looks me dead in the eyes, and says, “Give me a free coffee since you don’t have whipped cream.” I politely said, “No,” because... what?!

She huffs, leaves some money on the counter (not enough, of course), and bolts out the door. While I’m still processing what just happened, this guy nearby, who must’ve been eavesdropping, asks, “Was she cute?” We all laughed and said, “No.” Without missing a beat, he says, “Aww, I was about to give her some of my whipped cream.” That line? Pure comedy gold. Definitely the best part of the night.

But wait, there’s more. Enter the ERP manager—a textbook Karen. She came in with this holier-than-thou attitude, barking orders while I was trying to stock the tobacco. Everything inside the store was basically done, but we hadn’t tackled the outside yet, and she was not having it. She just kept nitpicking and complaining. Honestly, I was one ""Merry Christmas"" away from losing my mind.

So, yeah, that was my shift. How’s everyone else’s Christmas chaos going? Hope it’s at least entertaining!

And hey—Merry Christmas, everyone. Let’s survive these shifts together!

So I 22M met up with this girl 23F for some work related stuff back in end of October. It was something were we would never have to work together again. After that, she kinda hinted towards us meeting her at a bar with her friend, but I softly declined explaining I had work to attend early next morning. 

The day after I text her hoping they were safe, and they got home safely + trying to recruit her into our NGO. She declined saying she was going to get busy, and wouldn't have the time for it, but would contact me in the future when she had more time, and was still interested. 


2 weeks later, I was still thinking of her, so I texted her asking if she would meet up for a cup of coffee. She positively said yes. My next text for a location and time, she never got apparently. Some kind of setting/security she had on her phone blocked me because she had a stalker previously, but I also know my texts never reached my cousin or sisters, so could be a combination of both our phones having issues. 


I then messaged her Instagram. She replied after a few days, where she mentioned she never got my texts, and mentioned the stalker situation for her phones settings. In that voicemessage, she also mentioned being busy, and then talking about her work, studies, finding new apartment, and the fact we live decently far away from each other, that she wouldn't have the time for meeting up in the nearest future, but would love to find time in the near future. I texted back, but never have read the message.


For context she is also an influencer with over 1% of my countrys population following her, so I kinda expect her Instagram to be filled with DMs. 


So with all that said, I wonder when and especially if I should text her. I was honestly thinking of shooting a message in February, because then it would've been 5 months from our first meeting. Maybe the summer, because then she would have summer vacation, but that's also nearing a year by that point. Should I even be the one texting, or should I let it go, and wait for her to take initiative, which I doubt would happen?",2,1735132279.0,datingadviceformen,1,1.0,False

Doom 2099 - You thought you were buying a refreshing seltzer, but it's actually some random new energy drink with 300mg of caffeine. It's not what you thought you were getting, the taste is a little off and it might give you a heart attack, but you spent $3 on it so you're going to drink it anyways.  

Destroy - Yuengling. It used to hold the coveted ""best gas station beer"" award, times have changed though. It will always be there for you, and it's fun to go back sometimes. 

Move Bounce - A fresh made gas station sandwich from your local place. It's better than it has any right to be. It's about the same price as Subway but has three times the meat. God help you if your gas station replaced these with a Subway. 

clog - It's Natty Daddy, get your life together you degenerate. 

Galacta Midrange Decks - They're the new soup station your place just got. It's weirdly expensive, but it could be worse. Try mixing it with the free crackers next time, otherwise it might be pretty bland. 

Scream - It's the chili dog special at Stewart's. It's $2.99 and came with a soda. A meal for the discerning gas station connoisseur. People think your love of gas station chili dogs is weird, but you know it doesn't get any better than this. 

Wiccan - The new ""craft"" IPA the place just got in. It's more expensive than should be, but after an 8 hour shift on payday it feels pretty smooth. 

Agent Venom - Hamburger. It's definitely gotten worse over time. There's still something about it that's decent and it's a solid lunch in a pinch. 

Discard - Coffee. Available at any gas station in the world and pretty cheap. Nothing to write home about, it's a third of the price of those Starbucks iced coffees and may actually be better. 

Mill - It's a twisted tea tallboy purchased at exactly noon. You think you're doing better than the alcoholic clog players buying Natty Datty at 7am, but give it ten years and you'll be in the same place. 

Bounce - Pizza. Some days it's good, some days it's garbage. Ultimately, it's still pizza and you can't go wrong with that. 

Galactus - It's the box of White Claws you bought to bring to the party. We all know what happens next. You're going to drink them all by yourself, get a little sloppy, and have fun doing it. You do you. 

Thanos - That new soup station one year later. It's still weirdly expensive. You swear it used to be good, though it's never been the same since you realized it's just some powdered bullshit mixed by someone who doesn't care. Every few months they add a new soup choice, you try it again, maybe even like it for a day or two, and then realize it's still garbage. 

Ajax - Buffalo chicken wrap. It's good. It may even be great. You're definitely going to spend the next hour on the crapper when you're done. 

Arishem - A wet cigarette butt you found outside. At some point someone enjoyed it, now it's just sad and has a clinging nauseous reek of desperation.

I’m 21 and just trying to put myself out there a bit more and honestly I’m not the best at walking up to people and starting conversations IRL like how I wish I was one of those people who could just casually make friends at a coffee shop or like something but alas, here I am giving this a shot.  

I spend a lot of time out on the ocean and it's a long story, but it’s kinda part of my life, so if you like boats, the seas, or just vibing by the sea.. we’ll probably get along. When I’m not doing that, I’m usually listening to music, watching random shows, or honestly just daydreaming about traveling more. Oh and I’m also trying to be better about reading, so if you’ve got any good book recs so hit me up.  

I guess I’m just looking for someone or anyone to talk to literally about anything really. Be it life, memes, weird random thoughts, whatever that comes up in your mind. No pressure, no bad vibes, just some casual chats and maybe a good friendship out of it.  

So yeah, if you’re down to talk or even just send me a random Hi, I’d totally appreciate it. 😊

1hm0db2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Reformed/comments/1hm0db2/presbyterian_worship_liturgy_and_choices/,"Presbyterian worship, liturgy, and choices","There seemed to be some good discussion on Presbyterian worship here, and forgive me if this is not the best place to pose these questions, but it seemed like there were several well informed opinions, and I hope I can gain some understanding. 

First, let me begin by saying that I'm mostly a zelot anglo-catholic liturgist. I currently work in a Presbyterian (PC-USA) church for various reasons.  I'm certainly not looking to join the church as a worshiping member, and I'm not trying to covert anyone to anything.  However, I find it quite fascinating the types of questions I am asked, and the lack of liturgical understanding that comes from the congregation. 

I will likely over-generalize, and this will definitely sound sexist, but these are my personal experiences which I am attempting to understand in the greater context of corporate worship: 

Why are they (This particular church) not Anglican?  The standard Sunday worship service uses parts of Cranmer that any Episcopalian would feel quite at home with during the Eucharist.  The service is basically a stripped down BCP order, with words I assume they don't like just taken out ""to save time"" like the Sanctus..... There is talk of this mythical Presbyterian Book of Common Worship, but I have never seen one. 

The church currently is run by women who hate the KJV translation because its terrible theology? I am told daily about how the KJV is so bad it shouldn't be read anymore.  That's fine I guess, but people already know those words, and if we want to get more people into the building, sometimes familiar things said in a direct and dare I say *holy* way, can be a powerful tool to move people. They love to comment about how they were English teachers, ""Christian Educators"", or other things before they entered ministry which they try to use to justify some contemporary / inclusive / non-scripture source for a translation of words.   Its inconsistent, like the great confession being someones attempt to re-write based on the color of their coffee that morning. I don't understand why even more and longer words are needed, when ""We confess that we have sinned against you, in thought, word, and deed"" have done just fine for centuries.  I'm not proposing that we bewail our manifold sins, but there seems to be an attempt to write a new prayer of general confession for every single service, in as many different ways as possible.  I simply do not understand this practice. 

The congregation doesn't have any clue what's coming next (and neither do I).  ""Happy, Joy, Love"" is what I hear the leadership wants, and I do just work there, but there is never any discussion of the hard parts in the bible.  

I designed a carols service for them, which used the NIV, or whatever the latest ultra-modern translation they wanted, and they still didn't seem happy.  Everyone else told me they loved singing all the traditional hymns and were quite pleased with the service.  I definitely did keep the KJV reading of the shepherds going to the manger, and St. John unfolding the mystery of the incarnation - People already know these words, no reason to render them in a new translation for the sake of being modern. 

I will continue to support the congregation for as long as I am employed at this church, and I will continue to try and keep up with the changing whims of the female leadership. I only mention the female leadership, because when male pastors come, they always say ""just use the book of common worship"", and make no changes. This additionally keeps the congregation guessing.  I think the real question I have for myself is if one wants to disregard the prescribed liturgy, why not commit totally and do it!  Seems like it just one step away from being Baptist.  

One day, on my last day, I will complete the great thanksgiving aloud, (as it was in the beginning) which I say quietly to myself during Eucharist: It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth. *It is very meet, right, and our bounden duty!*

I'm sure some people will be triggered by my wording, or opinions, but I am only seeking better understanding of how to work with this church and leadership, other than saying ""Sure we can do that!"". 

Thanks for your time.

The late Rickey Henderson was born on this date in 1968. He needs no introduction but he is a Hall of Fame player with 297 homers, 1406 steals and a career on-base percentage of .401.



Jack Hamilton was born on this date in 1938. He was a right handed pitcher who pitched for the Mets in 1966 and 1967. On June 10, 1967, he was traded by the New York Mets to the California Angels for Nick Willhite. On August 18, 1967, Hamilton was pitching for the Angels at Fenway Park when he beaned Tony Conigliaro in the face and carried off the field on a stretcher. Conigliaro had a linear fracture of the left cheekbone and a dislocated jaw with severe damage to his left retina in his eye; he was wearing a helmet but it didn't have an earflap like modern helmets. Conigliaro survived the beaning but he was never the same and later retired from baseball at age 30. Jack Hamilton retired in 1969, finishing his career with the Chicago White Sox.

1hm05we,https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/1hm05we/why_i_chose_action_over_spirituality/,Why I chose action over spirituality,"*\*Disclaimer I am still a highly spiritual person, just got a new perspective of seeing it.*

About me: I am 20YO university going guy, and have been doing my spiritual practice(kind of a ritual) since almost an year now. It has been an important part of my morning... so much so that I prefer it before any meal of the day(yess including coffee too).

Last night at almost 1.30 AM I woke up from my sleep(I slept early that night so), and had a thought.

Spiritually is followed just because of two main reasons:

* We wanna know whats on the other side of this life, is it just empty void( \*one-punch-man reference :) ) or another realm or we get reborn here or our life restarted from the day 0
* And we wanna somehow use this world of energies to get success in our daily life

When I contemplated I realized that the reason I do my practices is to get an edge and support in my life, as Lord Krishna said in the Geeta that the result of a karma is decided that two main factor, the karma done and the deva factor(will of the GOD or universe), which we could simply state as probability if that is what he meant.

Then I felt kinda like a coward that I am such a lazy and weak person that instead of doing what I should do to get he desired outcome I am relying on the universe to give it to me.

Are'nt there people who get there results just by there actions(even  better than mine). Then I realized Lord Krishna was trying to do to Arjuna in the battle field.

Arjuna was afraid of the outcome of the outcome of the war that if he win then his relatives will die but if he looses he ll die. Then Lord said that one should not think about the outcome of his actions and should do the action just for the sake of doing it. Even telling us that if a person do his actions with his complete will then even devine force have to help him( he meant that even probabilities will allign themselves to help him). And even after knowing this when Arjuna wasn't convinced then Lord tells him that I am the Lord of the Universe I am Everyone and Everyone is me, just do your actions and dedicate them to me, i ll take care of everything what ll be meant to happen. Without my will not even a leaf could move.

If we carefully see what he meant to say was, ""JUst doing the actions and dedicate them to the world(me) Without its will (combination of all the probabilities of the world) nothing happens.

And thats where my eyes opened, this world is a karmabhoomi( place of action), whatever we get here is through our own actions only and the the will of GOD is nothing but the combined effect of everything that id going on in this world. 

This gave me the courage that anything I want could be achieved though my proudly done actions and and dont have to rely on anything else.

Come to the world after this life part...

We wanna believe in the life after death is because we don't want our existence to end with body, we wanna keep existing.

There a good news for everyone.... IT JUST DID NOT MATTER.

The only way to know the world after death is to just by dieing .

And if your existence end after death Congratulations  you ll never know that you ll end after your death and if there is something you ll get to know about it.

Either ways you are going to die(the final truth).

The WORST outcome you are fearing of you ll never get to face it. And if there is any after life or rebirth youll get to know about it.

1hm052f,https://www.reddit.com/r/PMDD/comments/1hm052f/nausea_sick_unusual_eating_habits/,"Nausea, sick, & unusual eating habits","On Tuesday last week, I randomly got extreme cold flushes & dizziness, and ended up throwing up at work, and had to be sent home. From the Friday before, so roughly the 13th of December, and until earlier this morning 25th December, around 7am (is currently almost midnight where I am), I'd been surviving purely off of:

* Oven baked curly & waffle fries,

* Plain (with no meat, or egg, only salt, or veggie stock sprinkled over it for some flavour) basmati rice,

* Dry or very VERY lightly buttered toast,

* Only water for fluids, except for coke (can't tolerate milk which is VERY unusual for me),

* Coke for the phosphoric acid for my nausea (this has been a game changer for me),

Also, my gag reflex has been off the walls sensitive, also manifesting in relentless yawning.

I'd also been having the Ondansetron, Cyclizine, & Phenerghan, that my doctor gave me, to try and keep the nausea, and the horrid tingly light headed cold sweats under control enough to sleep. Sometimes all 3 weren't quite enough to totally stop the dizziness, nausea, & light headed spine-tingling sweats, but were enough to thankfully stop me chucking.

I almost thought my body had an aversion to my job..... Because it was so sudden.

Weirdly enough though, at around 12/1pm-ish this afternoon, the intolerance for everything including coffee, switched over to a ravenous hunger for EVERYTHING. I'm about 5 days out from my period, according to the app I use.

Was like a heckin' light switch. Haven't had to have my nausea dose of Phenerghan today - first time in almost 2 weeks; and have had the other meds at their specific doses to prevent a flare-up of the nausea, because at this point, I'm suspicious that it's all of the sudden improving, after it being so extreme for so long (~10 days).

I've been craving the pfeffernusse icing-coated gingerbread cookies (I typically heavily dislike ginger), as well as stuff I don't normally want, like this one specific burger. Like angry if I don't get it type cravings.

Does anyone else get the really bad nausea, even out of nowhere, like I've never had the nausea be a symptom before, but it's popped up now all of the sudden (had bloods and stuff done already to rule other stuff out) randomly, with their PMDD?

Thankfully I'm getting my Zoladex this Friday.

1hlzwod,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_philosophysubboy/comments/1hlzwod/parasite/,Parasite,"Zulfiqar woke to the faint smell of mildew and the sensation of something wet coiling deep within his chest. It was an ordinary day in every other sense; the morning light spilled through the tattered curtains, and the city outside droned with its familiar symphony of footsteps and car horns. Yet, something stirred inside him, a faint gnawing, as if his very marrow was being reshaped by an unseen hand.

He pushed himself upright and felt the first pang. It wasn’t a physical pain but an unsettling clarity—a voice, though not a voice, whispering urges and commands. It wanted—no, needed—him to act. He shook his head and rubbed his temples, blaming the restless dreams that plagued his nights for the past month.

The morning stretched on in its usual monotony. He dressed in a threadbare suit and shuffled down the narrow staircase of his apartment. Mrs. Kohl, his elderly neighbor, struggled to carry a bag of groceries up the steps. Without hesitation, Zulfiqar offered his help. The bag was heavy with canned goods, and he could feel the woman’s gratitude radiating from her trembling hands.

“You’re a kind soul, Zulfi,” she said with a smile that revealed yellowed teeth. “Not many would bother.”

He nodded, muttered something unintelligible, and continued on his way. By the time he reached the street, his chest tightened, a searing heat radiating outward. Then it came: the scornful laughter of a young man loitering by the bakery.

“Helping old hags again, huh?” the youth sneered. “Bet she’ll tell everyone you’re trying to steal from her.”

Zulfiqar paused, startled. The laughter grew louder in his ears, but when he turned, the youth was silent, staring at his phone. He walked on, gripping his chest. The whispers coiled tighter, feeding on his discomfort. It was happening again—this perverse causality where his good deeds unraveled into snares.

That evening, he returned home to find his mailbox stuffed with crumpled letters. A notice from the landlord accusing him of tampering with the plumbing. A warning from the building committee citing complaints from tenants about his ""disturbing behavior."" It was nonsense, all of it, yet eerily familiar. Every attempt to help someone ended like this: backlash, misunderstandings, accusations.

He collapsed into the lumpy armchair in his dimly lit apartment. The whispers surged, louder now, speaking in tones that melded shame and compulsion. They dissected him, pried into his soul, and demanded penance for sins he couldn’t comprehend.

“Why?” he muttered aloud. “Why does this keep happening?”

The parasite within didn’t answer, but it throbbed, a pulsating weight that merged with his own heartbeat. He had tried to understand it, tried to resist. Yet each time he denied its call, the world seemed to twist further against him. He was both marionette and puppeteer, bound to a script written in some unfathomable language.

The next day, he tried to avoid everyone. He skipped the bus and walked three miles to work, eyes downcast and ears straining for the whispers. At the office, he kept his head low, answered emails with curt efficiency, and avoided the break room. But even in isolation, the whispers clawed at him.

“The coffee machine’s broken again,” said Nina from accounting, sighing as she juggled her papers and an empty mug. Zulfiqar hesitated, the parasite’s tendrils curling tighter around his mind. He wanted to help her, wanted to stay silent, wanted to walk away—but his body moved before his thoughts aligned.

“I can take a look at it,” he offered.

Nina smiled weakly. “Thanks, Zulfi. You’re always so helpful.”

The machine was old, its wiring a tangled mess. He fiddled with it for half an hour, his hands trembling as the whispers hissed directions. When the coffee finally dripped into a pot, Zulfiqar felt a fleeting sense of relief.

But by lunchtime, his supervisor called him into the office.

“We’ve had a complaint,” said Mr. Clarke, tapping a pen against his desk. “Something about you tampering with company property.”

“I was just fixing the coffee machine,” Zulfiqar protested.

“Nina said you made her uncomfortable,” Clarke interrupted. “Hovering around her desk, asking too many questions. Look, Zulfiqar, we appreciate initiative, but this isn’t the first time…”

Zulfiqar didn’t hear the rest. The whispers drowned everything else out, their laughter filling his skull with a cacophony of derision. He stumbled out of the office, his vision swimming. He’d tried. He’d only wanted to help.

Weeks passed, each day blurring into the next. The parasite grew bolder, its influence more insidious. Zulfiqar began to question whether his actions were truly his own. He’d find himself in strange places, performing acts he couldn’t recall initiating. Giving his last coins to beggars. Breaking into a stranger’s car to rescue a trapped dog. Cleaning graffiti off a church wall in the dead of night. Each time, the consequences followed like clockwork: accusations of theft, suspicion of ulterior motives, whispered rumors that gnawed at his already fragile reputation.

One evening, as he walked home through the rain-slick streets, he saw a figure lying on the pavement. It was a man, his face pale and contorted in pain. Zulfiqar’s instincts screamed at him to keep walking, to ignore the parasite’s urgings. But the whispers crescendoed, and before he knew it, he was kneeling beside the man.

“Are you alright? Do you need help?”

The man groaned, clutching his side. Zulfiqar searched his pockets for his phone, fumbling to dial emergency services. A crowd began to gather, their faces a blur of concern and suspicion.

When the ambulance arrived, the paramedics pushed Zulfiqar aside. He watched as they loaded the man onto a stretcher, his own hands shaking with adrenaline. Then a sharp voice cut through the air.

“Where’s his wallet?”

Zulfiqar turned to see a woman pointing at him, her eyes narrowing.

“I saw him going through his pockets,” she said.

The whispers roared with triumph as the crowd’s murmurs grew louder. Zulfiqar backed away, his protests swallowed by the tide of suspicion. By the time the police arrived, he was already running.

Back in his apartment, Zulfiqar stared at his reflection in the cracked bathroom mirror. His face was hollow, his eyes sunken with exhaustion. He ripped open his shirt, clawing at his chest as if he could tear the parasite out by force. But there was nothing to find—no mark, no scar, only the invisible weight that consumed him.

“Why?” he whispered. “Why do you do this?”

The parasite’s response was not in words but in sensation: a deep, abiding hunger that radiated through his entire being. It fed on his good intentions, twisting them into instruments of chaos. It thrived on his suffering, growing stronger with each failed attempt to do what was right.

Zulfiqar sank to the floor, his body wracked with sobs. He thought of his life before the parasite, a life of quiet mediocrity. He’d never been a hero, but neither had he been a villain. Now, he was both and neither, a puppet dancing to the whims of an unseen master.

In the days that followed, Zulfiqar withdrew from the world entirely. He stopped going to work, stopped answering his phone. The whispers grew restless, their demands more insistent. But he ignored them, locking himself in his apartment and refusing to interact with anyone. If he couldn’t do good without causing harm, then he would do nothing at all.

But the parasite would not be denied. It gnawed at him, its hunger a constant, unrelenting ache. He began to feel its presence more acutely, as if it were no longer content to remain hidden. His skin crawled with its movements, his veins burned with its touch. It was consuming him, piece by piece.

One night, as he lay on his mattress staring at the ceiling, he felt a sharp pain in his chest. He gasped, clutching at his heart as the parasite surged within him. His vision darkened, his body convulsing as the whispers reached a deafening crescendo. And then, for the first time, it spoke.

“*You cannot escape me*,” it said, its voice a chilling amalgamation of his own thoughts and something far more alien. “*You are mine, Zulfiqar Manto….. You always have been*.”

And as the darkness closed in, Zulfiqar realized the truth: the parasite was not some foreign entity, not some malevolent invader. It was infact *him*, a manifestation of his own fractured soul. It was his guilt, his doubt, his relentless need to prove his worth to a world that had long since stopped caring. Zulfiqar never quite gave it a thought….that the world could do better…without him…without his troubles, without his care or empathy….

Perhaps he wanted to give reassurance—to the people, to the world—but he was always shy of it, always a step behind where his heart wished to take him. The words, the gestures, the grand actions that could inspire hope, all of it slipped away before he could summon the courage.

Now, in the dim confines of his room, illuminated by a single bulb that cast jagged shadows on the peeling walls, Zulfiqar sat trembling. ""The only thing left for me to do now...is to give myself up. It would be the right thing to do,"" he muttered.

His hands moved mechanically as he prepared the rope, each knot a confession of his failure, each pull of the cord a penance. He tied it firmly to the loop of the ceiling fan, testing its strength as if the finality of the act deserved perfection. The air around him felt heavier, his breaths shallow as he stepped onto the rickety stool.

For a moment, there was silence, an eerie pause where the world seemed to hold its breath. Zulfiqar closed his eyes, letting the darkness envelop him, and kicked the stool away.

But death did not come. Instead, a searing pain erupted within him, clawing through his chest and writhing under his skin. *The parasite—had awakened*. He felt its tendrils coil around his lungs, his heart, pulling him back from the brink. The rope snapped, sending him crashing to the ground, gasping for air.

*""You think you can escape me?*"" a voice hissed inside his head, cold and mocking. It wasn’t his voice. It belonged to the parasite, the creature that had taken residence within him long ago. ""*I won’t let you die. Not like this. You’re mine.""*

Zulfiqar lay on the floor. The agony wasn’t just physical; it was the unbearable realization that even in his last act of agency, he was a prisoner. Zulfiqar’s struggle was not against the parasite but against himself. And as he succumbed to its embrace, he wondered if he had ever truly been free.

It has been just 10-12 days but we hit it off instantaneously. Coffee outings led to shopping, picnic in park, late night dinners, hand touching, putting one's head on another's shoulder, car drives, sleeping in each other arms, staying out till 2-3 in the morning or falling asleep under a blanket in the car, dancing, making future plans of going to clubs and parties, constantly talking and messaging to each other, kissing on hand/forehead/cheek. We are doing it on a daily basis.
She did confessed that she is, at times, irritated with her fiance. Her fiance lives far away. Recently, on one such outing, I noticed that she didn't wear her engagement ring.
The thing is that she made it clear to me on the first day itself that she isn't looking anything from me, no sexual pleasure or otherwise and she is content with her engagement and soon to happen marriage. She asked me if I will ever break her trust! And that she don't want to loose me.

She is hot as hell, irresistible, extremely good looking with a very sensuous body and I do compliment her on her features every now and then. She doesn't mind one bit and actually crave for my attention. We like to be around each other and are looking forward for our duties to end so that we can be together.

1hlzrmg,https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarfree/comments/1hlzrmg/sugar_and_its_affect_on_sleep/,Sugar and its affect on sleep,"40/M here. After 8 years I recently quit coffee about a month ago now. I've had a few decaff's here (though only 3mg of caffeine in a cup apparently) and there and am still guilty of grabbing a little bit of chocolate sometimes, but overall I am sleeping much better which is fascinating to me considering how long it took me to realize that coffee was that much of a culprit in my sleep troubles. I would only drink ONE cup a day, every morning, around 10am or so. That said, I was also a big iced tea drinker (and chocolate eater) as well, so you could make the case that I had an average of about 150mg of caffeine on some days.  I know thats not much at **all**, so for it to disrupt my sleep as much as it did, I think it would be safe to say by many that I have a pretty extreme sensitivity and almost an intolerance to caffeine. That brings me to my point which are me now wondering and worrying how my sugar intake might affect me...

Ever since qutting caffeine and sleeping better, there are still some nights where I struggle to get great sleep. I am trying to pinpoint why. A few nights ago for example I was at a late after work Holiday gathering where I had some banana pancakes with syrup. I'll admit, the stuff tasted like a desert. Sugar city. Grabbed a small orange juice on the side for a drink as well. This was all after 7pm at night. Long story short, that night I slept the worst I had since my coffee quitting was implemented. I took me a little longer than usual to fall asleep and I then woke up extremely early. There was not much deep sleep at all. It should be noted that for the rest of that day the only sugar I put into my body was a corn muffin and then a little drop into a decaffeinated tea with my lunch which was an egg white sandwich. This was all around 12pm.

So I'm curious if on this Christmas Day, anyone out there can give me their two cents with regards to someone like myself with a caffeine sensitivity, if a SUGAR sensitivity is also very likely as well. Thank you.",5,1735129208.0,sugarfree,2,0.86,False

I'll take you guys at your word that it's all delusional. I just want the truth. But the truth is it's simply delusions. Everything is as it appears to be on the surface. Face value. Stop trying to figure out hidden realities.



I want to scream SOMEONE TELL ME THE TRUTH. But it's all DELUSIONS. My mind goes haywire.



Do you ever feel like you're being lied to by everyone - family, parents, friends... And you want to scream TELL ME THE TRUTH? Even though they all say I'm delusional.



Is it really all delusions?



And everybody says: ""I'm afraid so, Andrew. I'm afraid it's really all delusions.""



Well, that's good because at least I wasn't betrayed. Because if I was betrayed by loved ones there would be betrayal trauma. If it's all delusional - it's easier to accept.



Let's put it this way, if I found out my mother and stepfather really conspired to pharmacologically abuse me... And I found that out beyond a shadow of a doubt, let's say I knew 100% they had nefarious intentions - this home would quickly become a powder keg



And they say: ""Okay but that didn't happen""



That's true. So toggle the emotional switch to ""off"". It's all good.

While I am okay with sharing, I’m just too tired of having to pay everything. It’s a cycle: he gets a job, gets fired or quit, and I’m left to pay for everything when he can’t.

We also moved to a new city to save money. I figured I could do more here since the living cost is lower from where I came from. My business didn’t do well so I decided to make this move 8 months ago. He willingly moved with me. He also used up his trust fund to put a deposit for a place and sustain us for two months. But a few months ago, my business started doing well again. He got fired a month ago and I have been paying for most of our bills, if not everything. There were also times when he’d borrow money from me. Up to date, he owes me over 10,000 USD. I also told him to sell everything he gave me just so he could at least sustain himself. He refused and got a little mad at me when I said I wanted to pawn the jewelry and sell the gadgets he gave. 

It was never a 50-50 situation with us, though. For the last four years, I have been paying most of the bills. He’d contribute when he has a job, but I’d always cover most of the bills. He also cooks, but doesn’t like cleaning. Because of this, I recently hired a maid. I didn’t wanna argue over the chores because I’m always tired of working (even though I work from home). He cooks and would help me with work from time to time, but he is not actively looking for a job now. 

I am so confused right now because he never did this. We had arguments, but he didn’t become this violent. He never laid a hand on me for the four years we have been together. It breaks my heart this happened during Christmas. We had a fun night at my parents’ yesterday and I am just so hurt right now. We have been open with each other and I brought this up with him many times, but it’s always the same cycle. He also refuses to tell his parents he’s been having a hard time keeping a job and that I’ve been covering for him. 

Please give me honest advice because I don’t know what to do. I couldn’t tell my family and friends because they like him and I don’t want to badmouth him about something like this. He has been loyal, honest, patient, and sincere with me. The only issue I had with our relationship was I felt like I have to cover most of the bills when he doesn’t have a job. Idk if I was just too attached to the money because I grew up poor, and he didn’t. Can this be fixed? Did I go overboard by saying he lives off of me? 

Feel free to ask questions for more context as well. I know it’s Christmas and I really appreciate any replies I’ll get here.
