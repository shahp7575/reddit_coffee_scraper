1p8lgl0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p8lgl0,Feeling stumped on furniture.,"I would love to hear some thoughts on how to furnish this living room. Some notes for your thought process:

-In an ideal world, seating would include at least one glider rocking chair (it doesn’t have to also be a recliner, but I’m looking for black “leather” seating and most of the ones I’m seeing in black also recline, so that would need more space), and either a small L shaped sofa or sofa with chaise.

-The right side of this room is oddly shaped, you can see in the second picture that the kitchen island juts out further than the beginning wall of the living space. My thought is to have some combination of cat tree/shelves and a bookcase(s) in that “dead” space. 

-To leave a walk way around the island, the living room space basically starts on the left side of the cat tree, where there is a tape mark on the base board. If thinking of the living room space as going from the mark on the baseboards to the rug laying behind the couch, the space is 140” x 140”, or about 11.5’ x 11.5’, but need to account for the sliding glass door opening on the right side behind the curtain. 

-The TV will not be mounted because I plan to do some trim work on the wall and that would force the tv to be too high and too far to the left to be centered in the trim (last pic is a partial blocking out of the trim). 

-I plan to replace the couch, not married to the coffee table or cat tree (just the cats).

1p8lgeo,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_absoluteredditorfr/comments/1p8lgeo/saw_this_hand_blender_on_youtube_and/,Saw this hand blender on youtube and….,"Here’s the video that started it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEP0m6ll6rQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEP0m6ll6rQ) 

I was just trying to figure out if hand blenders are worth it for soups and got sucked in. The guy in the video showed this full set from MuellerLiving and I was like… wait why does this thing have seven attachments?? At first I thought it was too much- who needs a frother, whisk, dual beaters, dough hooks, potato masher and a chopper bowl with their stick blender? But the longer I looked into it, the more I started realizing: this might actually be a really practical alternative to buying 4-5 separate tools.

What I found digging into the [MuellerLiving immersion blender set](http://dk5cnflyn7mcb.cloudfront.net/?q=GMKAO453)

* It’s got a 500W motor which is on the higher end for handhelds. Multiple sites mentioned that it doesn’t stall or overheat during normal use
* 8 speed settings + a turbo button- probably more control than I’d need but nice if you’re blending something delicate vs dense
* The attachments are the wild part:
   * Stainless steel blending shaft (standard)
   * Whisk and milk frother (for eggs, whipped cream, frothy coffee etc)
   * Dual beaters and dough hooks (!!) kind of rare for hand blenders 
   *  A potato masher attachment- didn’t know this was a thing but people said it helps avoid gluey mashed potatoes
   * A 20oz chopper bowl for stuff like onions, garlic, nuts, etc.

I checked a few review sites just to make sure I wasn’t being swayed by clever marketing. A lot of sites reviewed the core model (same motor) and said it has “bombproof” construction and holds up better than most cheap ones. They liked the grip and found it didn’t overheat, even on longer runs.

Also read a bunch of Amazon reviews (some suspiciously glowing but a lot felt legit) and a few common things came up:

* People liked that cleanup is fast.. most of the parts are dishwasher safe
* Works great for soups, sauces, baby food, whipped cream and light chopping
* Some said the whisk starts to wobble if you use it with heavy batters
* Doesn’t crush frozen fruit super smoothly.. more of a “soft blend” tool than a full on blender replacement

Not saying everyone needs this but… If you live in a small apartment or dorm and don’t want a million appliances taking up space, something like this seems like a solid multitasker. Especially if you’re into one pot cooking or make a lot of blended things. I also kinda love that it’s one of those tools that looks gimmicky at first but turns out to be genuinely useful. Like yeah a potato masher attachment sounds dumb until you realize it saves your wrists and gives better texture than smashing with a spoon or fork. Would love to hear if anyone’s used this one long term. Or if there’s a better stick blender + attachment combo I should be looking at instead?",1,1764303208.0,u_absoluteredditorfr,0,1.0,False
1p8lgb5,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1p8lgb5/hr_the_first_days/,[HR] The First Days,"The first days taught me more about myself than a lifetime of therapy and a counseling degree ever had. Maybe I had always known, just been unwilling to listen to that honest voice within. Ironic, considering I encouraged countless people to listen to that same voice, day after day, hour after hour, sitting across from me on the oversized brown leather couch that, once sat upon, convinced my clients that counseling could in some ways be comfortable. Once the sounds of the city fell away, there was nothing else to listen to but the voice inside, exposing me for who I truly am.

I'm a rat. I'm a coward. I conspired with the enemy and let my fellow humans fend for themselves. I offered nothing to the downfall of humanity except my unwillingness to risk my own life.

For six days I hid in the darkness of my apartment, door barricaded, silent, waiting for the screams and screeches to die down. Waiting for those unseen around me to die. I didn't save anyone. No hero's journey. No call to adventure. Just a descent into the underworld.

It only took six days for the city to go silent. No more alarms. No more screams. Just silence across Denver, aside from the birdsong and the falsetto, throaty chants of the squirrels.

Looking out my window I see bodies unmoving, cars and trucks strewn every which way. Like pictures posted by urbexers of abandoned amusement parks on the forums I used to visit. I always wondered what motivated people to climb through abandoned factories, hospitals, department stores. Now I find myself in one, wishing I knew a way out.

I can see Longs Peak to the west and north, Blue Sky a bit to the south on the skyline, and a handful of other peaks I told myself I would become familiar with when I first arrived here. Peaks I wanted to climb and ski. Peaks that I would only ever look at from my apartment window. I wanted to be a mountain man before I knew I was a rat, before I was willing to embrace my cowardice.

A coward with a story. Not a hero. Heroes die. Cowards tell their tale. Whose tale am I telling? I wonder.

I'm running low on food, water. The eight blue five-gallon jugs I filled in Ward last month are down to what little is left in the blue-and-orange striped ceramic basin that sits on the counter. Rice and beans are a complete protein, a voice reminds me. I'm out of rice. There are only three cans of beans.

I look down at the Safeway across the street. Cars and trucks parked every which way. I remember a podcast where a favorite actor from a forgotten sci-fi series talked about leaving magnets on cars that said, “I’m sure you’re a great person, but you park like an asshole.” I would need about seventy magnets. Who would read them?

I watch for several hours. Nothing moves aside from the birds and leaves that fell from an early frost before the temperature rose back up to the 70s. Typical October in Denver.

Below, nothing continues to move. A thought: Check the other apartments before heading across the street. A response: You’re a rat. Counter-thought: Rats survive.

I grab a backpack, a boxy pack I used for bike commuting, and a sturdy stick with a gnarled handle I would sometimes bring hiking, sometimes bring when just walking around the block. Virtue-signaling to others that I didn’t belong here, I belonged up there.

I begin dismantling the furniture I had stacked against the door, sliding the couch away and back against the wall where it had sat for seven years before it was repurposed less than a week ago. It isn’t long before the path is cleared.

I stand in front of the door. A rat with a backpack and a gnarled hiking stick about to enter a maze. Is anyone watching? Whose experiment is this?

I turn the handle, ease the door open, as light from the window behind me spills into the dark hallway. I pause, wait. Peering out from within the apartment, dust dances in the light just outside my door.  Slowly, I move forward until my head is resting on the door frame, looking with my left eye down the hallway to the right, toward the elevator.  Nothing but darkness. I need both eyes to make out anything in the darkness.  My head falls forward, slipping off the door and my shoulder clips the doorframe as I catch myself, one hand shooting out against the opposite wall. The carpet in the hall is soft under my bare feet, softer than I remember, muffling every shift of my weight. The air smells like dust and something faintly metallic, a scent I decide not to name.

I listen.

The building hums its familiar, low mechanical hum. The radiator pipes, somewhere in the bones of the place, tick faintly as they cool. Above me, a vent breathes stale air. No screams. No screeches. No footsteps. No human voices.

“See?” the voice says. “Maze is empty. You should’ve come out days ago.”

I ignore it, adjust the backpack on my shoulders, tighten my grip on the gnarled stick, and let my eyes adjust to the dark.

To the right: the elevator, a rectangle of heavier blackness. To the left: the long hallway toward the stairwell. There’s an exit sign at the far end, its red letters dead, leaving only a dull rectangle against the gloom.

Left. Always left in a maze, I remember reading once. Pick a direction and stick with it.

“Like exposure therapy,” I mutter under my breath, the sound absurdly loud. “Stepwise desensitization.”

Nobody laughs.

I move left.

Every door I pass is a known story: 4B with the weed smell and late-night bass; 4C with the older couple who always held the elevator; 4D where the college kids live who started smoking on the balcony during lockdown. Most doors are closed. One is ajar.

4E.

The door is open just enough that I can see the chain stretched tight and broken. The metal plate is ripped halfway out of the jamb, screws bent. A sharp footprint is smeared in dark brown on the wall next to the handle, as if someone was dragged, heels scraping, kicking at nothing.

“Don’t,” the rat-voice warns. “You already know what’s in there.”

But I don’t know. That’s the point, isn’t it? Curiosity and fear, twin engines of human behavior. I’ve said that exact sentence to so many clients. None of them had blackouts and sirens outside their windows.

I tap the door with the stick. It swings inward on silent hinges.

Living room, couch overturned, TV shattered in a spiderweb of glass. A coffee table on its side. A mug broken on the floor, coffee long dried into a rust-colored arch. One shoe by the entryway. No bodies. No movement.

The bedroom door is closed, and something heavy blocks it from the inside. The bottom of the door is dark, but the dark isn’t even. It’s a thick, tacky line. I step closer, then decide I’ve done enough.

“That counts,” I whisper. “You checked. You’re very brave.”

The sarcasm sits sour in my mouth. I back out, letting the door fall nearly shut again, and keep going.

Two more doors down, I find the first body.

He’s lying face down halfway out of his apartment, arms stretched toward the hall like he’d almost made it. One bare foot, one socked, gray sweatpants, a faded Broncos T-shirt. Mr. Takeout-from-the-Thai-place-on-Tuesdays. I never learned his name.

The back of his neck is gone.

Something has eaten it, hollowed it out, leaving a ragged oval where spinal cord and artery ought to be. The skin around the wound is blackened, almost charred-looking, and threaded with fine dark veins like spider cracks in ceramic. The edge of the wound glistens. It isn’t wet. It’s…wrong. Matte, but gleaming.

My stomach clenches. I step around him as if he’ll complain if I tread too close.

“This is what you hid from,” the voice says. “You thought you were above all this. You’re not. You’re meat that got lucky.”

On the landing by the stairwell door, someone has scrawled HELP in what I hope was red marker. The letters are smeared by a handprint that slid down to the floor. The stairwell itself is cooler, the concrete walls closing in around me. The echo of my footfalls comes back quicker here.

Down to three. Pause. Listen. Nothing.

I check the door to three. Locked. I’m suddenly grateful for everyone who always complained about management’s cheap locks but never bothered to change them.

Second floor, then first. On the second, the door has been propped open with a fire extinguisher. It’s tipped over now, a trail of white powder dusting the threshold. Beyond, the hallway is brighter: someone’s door is open wide, letting in daylight from a window at the far end.

I step around the extinguisher, the powder whispering under my feet. A TV blares somewhere, stuck on a dead channel, the soft hiss of static filling the floor like fog.

I follow the noise and find open unit 2A.

Inside, the TV is on, cable box flashing its dumb blue eye. A body slumps against the entertainment center. Older woman. I recognize the cardigan, the floral-print blouses she wore on Sundays, the walker parked by the hall closet.

Her head is tilted back at an impossible angle. Her jaw hangs open, eyes crusted shut with a dark, tarry film. Her chest has been opened—no, not opened. Something has come out through it, ribs broken outward like the peeled petals of a flower. The inside is black, not red. Black like asphalt on a hot day, thick and bubbled and wrong.

I back away, throat tight. I remember her voice asking me once, in the laundry room, what I did for a living. I told her I was a therapist. She’d smiled and said, “Lord knows this world needs more of those.”

“Does it?” I whisper now, and turn to leave.

On the way out, I see the magnet on her fridge: IT’S NEVER TOO LATE TO BE WHAT YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN. I resist the urge to rip it free and throw it across the room.

I take her water instead.

There are three twelve-packs of bottled water stacked awkwardly in the corner, a prepper instincts purchase or a Costco habit. I load as many bottles as I can into my backpack, shaking with the awkward weight. In the pantry, I find canned soup, beans, corn. I take what will fit. I leave the magnet.

On the first floor, the lobby is dim, the big windows filmed with grime. Someone has put duct tape across the glass in big Xs, as if a hurricane was coming. The front door is propped shut with a chair and several mop buckets. I move the chair first, then the buckets, and the door gives with a soft moan of weather stripping breaking its seal.

Outside, Denver smells like rot.

Not fresh rot, the sweet, gagging smell of immediate death. This is older, baked under days of unseasonable October warmth. The sky is a sharp, clean blue that doesn’t match the street below.

Bodies in cars. Bodies on sidewalks. A bike tangled in the front grill of a Subaru. The Safeway parking lot is frozen in mid-panic: a car halfway out of a space with the door hanging open, another up on the curb, shopping carts scattered like tumbleweeds. A delivery truck is jackknifed across two lanes, its back doors open and dark.

The silence presses against my ears until I can hear my pulse.

“No sirens,” I say. “No helicopters. No humanity.”

“Rats survive,” the other voice answers. “Go get your cheese.”

I adjust the backpack again, reassuring myself with the slosh of water bottles, and start across the street, stick tapping the asphalt like a blind man’s cane.

At the edge of the Safeway lot, I pause beside a crushed cart. There are skid marks where someone braked hard and then another set where someone didn’t brake at all. A smear—I refuse to decide what color it is—ends under the cart’s front wheel.

“Move or don’t move,” I tell myself. “Choose.”

I move.

The sliding doors of the grocery store are cracked open at an angle, one twisted on its track. Glass crunches underfoot. Inside, the fluorescent lights flicker, many of them dead. The air is cooler, staler.

“Hello?” I call before I can stop myself, voice small in the cavernous space. The therapist in me instantly catalogs the self-destructive impulse. “Announcing your presence in an unknown hostile environment: ten out of ten for maladaptive coping, Sam.”

First time I’ve called myself by my name since this started. It surprises me.

“Hello,” a voice answers.

I freeze.

It came from my left. From the produce section, behind a low wall of ugly apples and browning lettuce. It’s a woman’s voice. Strong. Too strong. That’s what my trauma-brain says. Too strong means not scared. Not scared means dangerous.

Then a head appears above the mound of potatoes. Dark hair in a messy knot, eyes narrowed, a chef’s knife held low by her side.

“Move slowly,” she says. “Hands where I can see them.”

My hands go up, stick dangling from one thumb.

“I’m friendly,” I lie.

“We’ll see about that.” She straightens, scanning the store behind me, then steps out fully from behind the display. She’s short, all wiry muscle and hard angles, early twenties maybe. There’s already a smear of black on the cuff of her hoodie, and I don’t know yet that this is important.

“Name?” she asks.

“Samuel,” I say. “Sam.”

She snorts. “Of course you’re a Sam. I’m Charlie.” She nods at the stick. “That your only weapon?”

I open my mouth to answer and nearly swallow my tongue when someone moves behind her.

He’s tall, late thirties, salt-and-pepper beard, holding a fire axe that looks even bigger in his hands. His face is gaunt but his eyes are bright, too bright. He takes me in with one long look and rests the axe on his shoulder.

“Another one,” he says to Charlie. “Thought you said we were out of luck.”

“I said we were almost out of luck,” she replies. “That means room for one more miracle. You alone?” she asks me.

“Yes,” I say.

He arches a brow. “Honest?”

I think of the corpses upstairs, the open door of 2A, the magnet. “Yes,” I say again. This time it feels less like lying.

“Where’ve you been?” the bearded man asks. “It’s day six.”

“Hiding,” I answer. “In my apartment.”

Charlie whistles low. “You’re one of those.”

“One of what?” I ask.

“Popcorn people,” she says. “Sit in your little bag until the heat gets too high, then pop.”

The bearded man chuckles, then offers a hand. “Bruce,” he says. “That’s Alan by the butcher counter, Marge in the pharmacy, Tommy at the back door. We’ve been here since day two.”

“Why?” I blurt, before I can put a filter on. “It’s a grocery store.”

“Exactly,” Bruce says. “Food. Lockable doors. One main entrance. No windows low enough for those things to crawl in.” He pauses. “Until the generators died.”

As if on cue, the lights flicker again, then half the remaining bulbs go out, plunging the far aisles into deeper shadow.

“Speak of the devil,” Charlie says. “We heard you from the windows. Thought you might be one of them at first.”

“One of…them,” I repeat. “Have you seen them? Up close?”

Bruce glances at Charlie, and something silent passes between them.

“Too up close,” he says at last.

“We lost Alicia this morning,” Charlie adds quietly. “She thought she could outrun one. She couldn’t.”

There’s a weight there that tells me not to ask for details.

My therapist brain notes their eye contact, the shifts in posture, the way Charlie’s fingers twitch on the knife handle. They’ve lost people. They’re raw. I could name the stages of grief they’re moving through, but the labels feel obscene.

“Come on,” Bruce says. “If you’re with us, you might as well earn your keep. We’re loading up. Can’t stay here anymore with the power going. We’re moving.”

“Moving where?” I ask.

“West,” he says, like it should be obvious. “I-70’s a parking lot of corpses and scrap, but we’re going to try surface streets until we find a way to cut north. There’s a place we heard about. Braggs. Small town. Mountains. Word is it’s holding out.”

“Word from who?” I ask.

“Guy on the radio before the station went dead,” Marge says, emerging from the pharmacy, arms loaded with pill bottles, gray hair sticking out from under a Safeway baseball cap. “Said, ‘If you can get to Braggs, get to Braggs.’ So that’s what we’re doing. You got a better idea?”

I don’t.

I think of the peaks on my horizon, of how I used to imagine skinning up pre-dawn slopes and dropping into untouched snow. Of how all my fantasies involved leaving the city but never actually triggered me to leave.

“West,” I say. The word feels strange in my mouth, like someone else’s line. “I was just…thinking that.”

Charlie studies me, eyes narrowing.

“You a doctor or something?” she asks.

“Something,” I say. “Therapist.”

She barks a humorless laugh. “And here I thought we were out of useless professions.”

Bruce shoots her a look. “Hey now. Someone’s gotta keep us from going nuts.”

“Newsflash,” Charlie says, grabbing a sack of rice off a shelf and tossing it into a cart. “We’re already there.”

We pack in a grim parody of shopping. No price tags, no coupons, no small talk. Carts piled with bottled water, canned food, lighters, batteries. In the back aisle, I run into a man I hadn’t noticed—a stocky guy with a limp, cradling a shotgun like it’s a newborn.

“Steven,” he grunts when I introduce myself. “Sarah’s at the loading dock, keeping watch.” He doesn’t look at me when he says her name. It’s as if he’s trying not to disturb it.

We leave by the loading dock, because the front is too exposed. Outside, the alley smells worse than the street. Flies swarm around a mound of something that used to be a man. His chest is opened the same way as the woman in 2A. I feel my brain trying to categorize it and slam the door shut on that impulse.

The first scream comes two blocks later.

It’s high and shrill, cuts off mid-breath. We all freeze. The sound came from up ahead, past the line of stalled cars, somewhere near the intersection.

“Stay,” Bruce orders, raising his axe. He and Tommy move forward, Charlie flanking them with her knife.

I hear the screech next—a wet, tearing noise like metal scraping on bone, undercut with a sound similar to the feral cats in the alley behind my building when they used to fight.

Then the thing appears.

It was a woman, once. The shape is still there: dress shredded, hair tangled. But her jaw hangs open too wide, unhinged, and the black film crusting her eyes has cracked in places, oozing fresh darkness. Her arms jerk in odd, puppet-like movements. Her chest pulses beneath torn fabric, as if something is pushing against it from inside, testing the ribs.

She’s feeding on something on the ground. Or someone. The body beneath her kicks weakly once, then goes still.

The bearded man—Bruce—doesn’t hesitate. He swings the axe down in a clean, practiced arc. The blade sinks into the back of the thing’s neck, severing everything important. The body twitches, then collapses, boneless.

Black liquid bubbles up from the wound, thick and slow, like oil from a shattered drum.

“We go for the spine,” Bruce says, breathing hard. “Head if we can’t. Chest if we have to. Open it and whatever’s inside doesn’t move anymore.” He looks at me. “You still want to come with us, therapist?”

I realize my stick is between us, held out like a crucifix. My hands are trembling.

“Rats survive,” I whisper. Then louder: “Yes. I’m coming.”

We move.

The journey across Denver blurs into a series of corridors: streets choked with wreckage, alleys littered with trash and bodies, office lobbies that smell of coffee and fear. We lose Tommy by the burned-out bus on Colfax, pulled from the back of the line by three of them that came out of nowhere. We lose Alicia just like Charlie said: she breaks formation, thinking she can sprint past a feeding one before it notices. It notices.

Jeremy dies in the stairwell of an office building, chest opened by something that drops down from the ceiling tiles. Kristen disappears in the chaos when a car alarm suddenly blares and a dozen of them pour out of a parking garage. One moment she’s there, the next her scream is somewhere we can’t reach.

Each death is a jagged tear in the group fabric. Marge mutters prayers under her breath. Alan stares ahead with the thousand-yard stare I’ve seen in too many vets. Charlie curses at everything—the sky, the asphalt, the things, herself. Steven grows quieter with each block, his hand never leaving Sarah’s shoulder.

I do what I’ve always done.

I track who’s dissociating, who’s hypervigilant, who’s starting to shut down. I nudge Charlie out of a panic spiral by snapping her focus back to her breath. I talk Marge through grounding exercises when she starts to shake. I put a hand on Steven’s back, just between the shoulder blades, when I see his knees going soft.

“This is absurd,” part of me thinks, even as my mouth moves, even as I hear my own voice say, “You’re here. Right now. Name five things you can see.”

The world ended and I’m still running group therapy in the street.

“Maybe this is your penance,” the rat-voice suggests. “You hid while everyone died. Now you get to watch people die up close and call it work.”

We rest once, in the skeletal shade of an overpass. The city around us is oddly beautiful in its ruin. No traffic. No airliners overhead. Just wind and the far-off cawing of crows.

“That Braggs place,” I ask Bruce as I chew on a protein bar that tastes like compressed dust. “You really think it’s real?”

“I think it’s more real than this,” he says, gesturing at the crumpled skyline. “That’s enough for me.”

“Why north?” I press. “Why not south? Or just…stay moving?”

“Because the radio said Braggs,” Charlie snaps. “What, you want a peer-reviewed study? Randomized controlled trial of survival routes?”

“No,” I say. “I want…a story that ends somewhere. That’s how we’re built, like it or not.”

She stares at me for a moment, then shifts her weight, wincing slightly. I notice it now: the subtle favoring of her right leg. The way she keeps her right arm close to her side.

“You good?” I ask.

“I’m fine,” she says too quickly. “It’s just a scrape.”

“Let me see.”

She rolls her eyes. “Don’t go full therapist on me.”

“We’ve seen what happens with bites,” I say. “If you’re hiding—”

“I’m not hiding anything,” she snaps, standing. “Can we go? Before the things under the bridge decide to wake up?”

We move on.

By late afternoon, the buildings thin out. The clutter of the city gives way to wider roads, more sky. Some of the house windows out here are still intact, curtains fluttering. Lawns are frozen mid-transition between green and brown. Halloween decorations—the cheap, plastic kind—hang limp on front porches.

We pass a yard with a sagging inflatable ghost still struggling to stand, its internal fan whining weakly. Charlie glares at it.

“Same, buddy,” she mutters.

The Denver City Limits sign appears in the distance, a green rectangle tilted slightly from some old fender-bender. Beyond it, I can see the wide slash of road leading toward the foothills, the mountains rising behind them, blue and solid and real.

For a moment, I let myself imagine that reaching that sign will be like stepping through a portal. That whatever rules apply in here, whatever nightmare logic governs the things and the black bile and the opened chests, will stop applying out there.

Home, the word rises unbidden, and I push it down.

We’re almost to the sign when Charlie coughs.

It’s a small sound at first, then a wrenching one. She grabs at her chest, eyes wide, and I see the first dark thread of liquid seep from the corner of her mouth.

I know what it means before anyone says a word.

Guilt hits like a wave. I think of the way she moved, the wince, the too-swift dismissal. I think of my own hesitations, my avoidance, my desperate mental gymnastics to preserve some illusion of safety.

“You saw it,” the voice hisses. “You saw it and you didn’t insist. You didn’t force the issue. You didn’t want to know.”

“I’m sorry,” I whisper, but I don’t know if I mean to her or to myself or to whatever part of me still believed I could do this without getting more blood on my hands.

She drops to her knees, black liquid drip-dripping onto the pavement, and everything slows.

The others cluster back, shock painted on their faces, the city stretching behind them in long, broken lines.

I step forward, fingers closing around the handle of the hunting knife at my belt—a knife I took from the sporting goods aisle in Safeway and pretended made me something other than prey.

For six days I hid while other people died for me. For two more I’ve watched people die around me while I administered coping skills and false hope.

Now there is a woman at my feet who trusted me enough to follow me out of a grocery store and across a dying city. She lifts her eyes to mine and there’s no therapist and no client anymore, no rat and no mountain man. There’s just a person asking another person for the only kindness left.

I put my hand on her head, feel the warmth of her scalp through her hair, and draw the knife.

It was nearly sunset when Samuel and the others reached the edge of the city, and he watched pensively as the sun began to drop behind the Rocky Mountains.  He turned to face the ragged and worn crew that had followed him, their shadows stretched long on the pavement, reaching back towards the city they had just escaped.

""I never did like Denver "" Samuel said more to himself than anyone else, but Charlie heard him nonetheless.

""I get the sense that Denver never really liked you,"" she sneered, ""but it was the only home I ever knew.""

Home.  The word seemed foreign to Samuel.  He wondered if Denver was ever really his home, and for a moment his mind drifted to the wooded valleys and rolling hills of the Adirondacks.  He thought briefly of his parents, hoping the end came quickly for them, knowing  he would never see them again.  Now there was nothing east except for pain, sorrow, and death.

""West,"" he said in response to his own thoughts.  ""West,"" he said again, this time as a command to the others, ""we have to continue heading west until we find a clear route northward to Braggs.""

""Can't we just rest a moment?"" Alan said as he and the others caught up to Samuel and Charlie.  ""We're all so tired, Colleen is limping, Marge is about ready to fall over from exhaustion, and Steven hasn't spoken a word since Sarah..."" he trailed off.

""Since Sarah was eaten, Alan, that's what happened, there's no use is pretending it's anything different,"" Charlie's words fell harshly from her lips, ""just like Bruce, Tommy, Alicia, Kristen, just like Jeremy, just like my mom and dad, just like everyone else I've ever known and just like you one day too!""

""Enough!"" Samuel's contempt couldn't be disguised, ""weve all lost people, and losing people doesn't get any easier.  Steven just lost his wife, and he deserves at least a moment to grieve before you project your frustration about this hellscape lnto the only people you have left.""

""The world is ending and you're still acting like a therapist?"" Charlie laughed at herself, her face contorted as she continued to speak, ""just give it a rest for...""

Her words were interrupted as her chest heaved and she emitted a gruesome sound.  Black liquid seaped out from her clenched lips. Keeling over, her mouth opened and let out the dark, inhuman vomit that pooled on the asphalt beneath the red-orange glow of the Denver sky.

No one spoke.  Samuel approached Charlie as she knelt on her knees, staring down into the black pool that just came from inside her.

""I'm sorry, Samuel,"" Charlie spoke without lifting her gaze.

""I'm sorry, too, Charlie,"" Samuel said, placing one hand gently against her head and drawing his hunting knife from his belt with his other.  

""Show me,"" Samuel said I. a kind yet firm voice that did not invite any objection.

Charlie lifted the right sleeve of her hoody, revealing a bite mark that looked like it came from a human.  She weeped softly as she lifted her head, noticing for the first time the street sign some 20 yards away which read Denver City Limits.

""Twenty-two years I've lived here, never once leaving the City.  I guess it makes sense doesn't, it?  That I'd die here?""

Charlie's dark eyes met the soft blue of Samuel's.

""None of this makes sense, Charlie.  I'm sorry."" He pressed the knife tip against her temple.

""Do it,"" Charlie said, but Samuel hesitated.  ""Do it!""

The knife slid in and Samuel lowered Charlie gently to the ground. ""I'm sorry,"" he said once more.

Samuel put away his knife.  Presently, he spoke to Marge, Alan, Colleen, and Steven, tears welling in his eyes.

""We have to move.  Up ahead there, let's see if we can find a room on the second floor of that motel to rest for the night.  Tomorrow, we continue west.""

Samuel began walking and the others trolled behind.

I have just moved back from living alone abroad into my husband's awful matchbox house with no soundproofing. I work, he is retired .Because we once clashed over the bathroom in the morning (he uses it to dump even though we have a downstairs toilet) he is now setting his alarm to wake up before me. I usually wake up at 7.30am which is perfect for me. Monday he woke me at 5.45. Tuesday 6am, yesterday 5.15. Then the noise starts. Him  being in the bathroom, lights on, blowing his nose loudly, talking to the cat outside my door (we sleep separately because of these issues). Then downstairs, the microwave door is banged when he makes coffee, the kitchen tap is run (badly plumbed). Then he goes in the lounge and starts clearing his throat loudly for the next hour. I have chronic migraine and I need 8 hours sleep a night to function. I am now off sick with a bad migraine. It doesn't matter how many times I ask him to not make so much noise, he takes no notice. It's like the floors are made of cardboard. I've started going to bed an hour earlier but it's not helping. Nothing I put in my ears helps either. I've just got earplugs off Amazon that are supposed to block out 60 decibels. His attitude is it's his house and he won't be told what to do in it. It's like he doesn't give a toss how he's affecting my health. I start a new job in 2 weeks and I will have to work 2 10 hour days and I don't know how I'm going to cope. He's always been like this when I have a migraine. Over 20 years I don't think he's even asked me if I want a glass of water when I've been in bed for 3 days. His response when I say I've got a migraine is ""that makes a change. Does anyone else get treated this way?",1,1764303188.0,migraine,0,1.0,False

1p8l8k6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Designforlife/comments/1p8l8k6/most_common_decorations_and_items_placed_on/,Most Common Decorations and Items Placed on Console Tables,"A **table lamp** is probably one of the most common and practical items to add to your console table. Not only does it serve a functional purpose, casting warm, welcoming light, but it also adds an elegant touch to the space. A sleek, slim lamp doesn’t overwhelm the table; instead, it provides just the right amount of light and style, helping to brighten up even the smallest of entryways. Whether it’s a modern design or a more classic, traditional piece, a lamp can instantly elevate the look of your console.



**Mirrors** are another staple that many people opt for, especially in entryways. They not only help make the space look larger and more open by reflecting light, but they also serve a practical function — allowing you to check yourself out before you leave the house. A mirror can also become the focal point of your console table, especially when paired with a striking frame. Whether it's round, rectangular, or vintage-inspired, a mirror helps create a balanced, harmonious feel in the room.



Of course, no space feels complete without a touch of nature. Many people love to place **plants or flowers** on their console tables. A small vase with fresh flowers can instantly brighten the space and add a fresh, natural element to an otherwise minimalist design. If you’re not the green-thumb type, low-maintenance plants like succulents or snake plants can be just as effective. A simple potted plant brings life to your entryway while complementing other decorative items on the table.

Paired with a few branches, dried flowers, or even as an empty display piece, vases are a simple way to inject style without cluttering up your space.

https://preview.redd.it/o7euyyd59x3g1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc6feed71881f2256970eeae76de25d9fabfbb7e

For practicality’s **sake, trays and bowls** are also essential additions. Not only do they help corral smaller items like keys, wallets, or mail, but they also contribute to the overall decor. A stylish tray made of marble, metal, or wood can turn a mundane task — like organizing your everyday essentials — into a chic display. It's a simple solution for keeping things tidy, without sacrificing style.



Another popular choice is stacking a few **decorative books or magazines**. It might seem simple, but a well-placed stack of coffee-table books adds personality and a touch of culture to your entryway. Whether it’s a stack of books related to art, fashion, or photography, they’re an easy way to bring your personal style to the forefront. Plus, books can act as a base for other items, like a decorative bowl or a plant, creating a layered look on your console.



For those who have the extra shelf space, adding baskets or storage bins underneath the table is an excellent way to keep things organized. Whether you use them for shoes, scarves, or extra bags, baskets are a stylish and practical storage solution. Plus, they can double as decor themselves, especially if you choose a woven design or a matching set that complements your console’s aesthetic.",1,1764302505.0,Designforlife,0,1.0,False

1p8l6xr,https://www.reddit.com/r/humansarespaceorcs/comments/1p8l6xr/sent_to_the_exiles/,Sent to the Exiles,"The trial of the Prixian war criminals was over. Traxi, Wurr, humans—all of the races who suffered from the Prixian war machine were present in the courtroom located on a station fully reserved for the condemned. Some of the war criminals were spared. Some were saved. But most of those present were sentenced to capital punishment.

""KILL THEM WITH ACID!"" voices demanded. ""FEED THEM TO THE HIVE!"" they screamed. ""Life sentence by firing squad with forfeiture of property,"" said the Wurr calmly. But after all, the last word belonged to humans, whose fleet was the dominant power throughout the whole conflict.

The old judge, whose body consisted more of metal and plastic augmentations than flesh, scanned the sentenced aliens with the indifferent stare of red glowing lenses. He pulled out a sheet of paper and with a sound of activating speakers that could be interpreted as clearing his throat, he began to speak. ""According to the vote, your sentence would have been a lifetime in simulation and the installation of internal implants that will stimulate your pain and fear receptors while you live through the memories of your regime's victims, until your brains eventually burn out. But you were... 'Called.' So you are given an alternative choice. We may send you to... Exiles. The choice is yours.""

""Wait. So the choice is to die a slow and painful death or be... exiled?"" One of the officers looked confused, as did the other defendants. ""Not exiled. Sent to Exiles. They asked to send you to their world. We saw this as an appropriate alternative punishment. Take your pick."" The judge raised his hand slightly and a small gavel jumped into it, following the built-in magnets. He was about to announce the final verdict and showed with his entire demeanor that he would not wait long.

""Then I want to be exiled!"" the alien screamed. ""Me too!"" ""And me!"" War criminals announced one after another, until eventually everyone made their choice. The judge took a long pause, scanning through the row of defendants, and with a deep exhale slammed the gavel on the table. ""So be it. The trial is over.""

""Yeeeey!"" The happy scream came moments after the sentence was announced. In one jump that could be mistaken for flight, a fluffy creature appeared right in front of the shocked criminals. A canine-like anthropomorphic creature covered in nothing but its own unnaturally colorful fur was jumping happily near the sentenced aliens. ""I'm so glad, guys! Don't worry, it will be fun and you will like it! I'm sure we will become best friends together! And you! You were the one who told your people to feast on cubs in captured colonies?! Well, I'm sure we can find someone who is into that back home! And you, the general—I'm a big fan of yours! There's so much I want to discuss! And you...""

The slam of the hammer stopped the happy creature mid-sentence. ""Silence in the courtroom! Take them out of here and escort them to the ship."" His usually calm face showed natural disgust when looking at the colorful fluffy creature—as if it were not a product of aggressive genetics, but a disfigured gory corpse. ""The trial is over. Everyone dismissed!"" He watched the sentenced aliens go. For a moment, his face showed something like compassion for them before he turned off most of his face implants and left.

Later at the station, a young alien attorney was sitting in the giant ship bay, inside a small food station. Near him, a human was drinking something from a cup covered in more chemical hazard markings than company labels—the only way coffee could be openly sold here.

""I don't get it,"" said the small feathered creature. ""They broke nearly every rule in the book. They brought so much suffering to everyone. And now they are just... leaving? How is that fair?!""

The human put down the cup and sighed. ""They are sent to Exiles. They are not leaving.""

The alien raised his feathers. ""Whatever! They will live on. That's not fair. Who are these Exiles in the first place?! Why can they just suggest their own sentences?! I thought it was supposed to be humans who announced it!""

His companion winced. ""They... are humans. Unfortunately.""

""Huh? But they look nothing alike... are they some form of mutants?""

The human turned around, looking at the Exiles delegation near the ship. Multiple creatures were standing near the vessel, waiting for their turn to leave.

""They are... how do I explain it... they are one of the human factions. In a way, they are the most pacifist of us all. They never waged war in known history. They never joined conflicts. They don't even compete on the galactic market. They keep to themselves and actively avoid any contact with other humans. Many say that they are not humans anymore, but they don't think so themselves. Ugh... unfortunately.""

The human turned away as if looking at the happy team of different gene-modded creatures made him want to vomit.

""Then... why was that one so happy about taking those war criminals?! Why would a pacifist faction want someone so dangerous within their lands?""

""Because they all are... much, much, by thousands of orders of magnitude worse!"" The human spat out. ""If they weren't in voluntary exile, we would cleanse their whole kind from orbit years ago!"" The human crushed the cup in his hand. His face showed pure disgust and anger. ""Or at least... we'd try...""

After a long pause, the human raised his eyes to the small avian alien. ""Of course, you still don't get it. Alright. I can explain.""

The human closed his eyes. ""We are still not sure who the founders of their faction were. Some say it was a religious community. Some say they originated from a bunch of crazy scientists. Yet when we met them first, they quickly proved that despite all of their genetic alterations, they were still genetically human. They had records of their Terran history, though not complete and generally corrupted. At first, we too saw them as radical pacifists. Their planet lacked any industry. They relied on genetic alterations to make themselves closer to nature and reduce consumerism as much as possible. They were friendly. Too friendly. They were accepting, kind, nice, and curious about everyone. Perfect society... until you speak to them any longer than you should.""

The human made a sign to the robot staff, ordering another cup. ""As casually as they could discuss nature, science, philosophy, and media, they were talking of atrocities, crazy and twisted perversions. And they spoke of them not in theory. I remember talking to one. He helped me find common ground with my son. But then I... found out that he knew much more about child psychology than he should have. Much, much more. And he knows how to use that knowledge for whatever twisted desire he might ever have. He spoke of it so casually. My heart freezes at the single thought that he might one day meet my children! And then another! Despite the fact that Exiles don't have a known fleet, somehow they had the technology that could turn stars into psychic resonators that could make everyone in the system feel constant pain inside their very souls! They know how to use and tune it. And they are somehow well aware of the consequences. Very aware.""

The human paused, staring into his new cup. ""I heard of those who hacked into their inner networks. Let's say they speak in memetic hazards. Their society's greatest development is their absolute corruption of the very concept of morality. And their acceptance of everyone works like... a giant purulent wound. They let in the worst people this reality could produce and find them even worse companions. This crucible produces... I don't even know what horrors they are capable of now. They have a whole database of all possible atrocities that could come to mind. Next to it, our Geneva list is like furniture assembly instructions next to starship blueprints.""

The bird alien looked at the human in confusion and fear. Humans were already the most crazy, unhinged, and scary race in the galaxy. Yet it was the first time he saw a human this scared. And he clearly didn't tell him everything.

""B-but... why do you call them pacifists then?""

""Because despite the fact that they know perfectly how to turn this reality into incarnate terror... they don't. They spend their time on their worlds, among jungles and forests of genetically constructed trees. They live in harmony, filling literally all biological niches of their world with different breeds of themselves. They spend their time having fun, creating art, and reproducing. They are ruled democratically, though instead of leaders they use something they call 'people's spirits,' which are... I think are AIs who argue with each other, finding common ground instead of the Exiles... or maybe not AIs... I don't even care, in fact. The main thing is they are keeping to themselves and staying away from everyone's business.""

The feathered alien watched as the strange, seemingly biological ship of Exiles left. ""What will happen to the... sentenced?""

The human drank another cup. ""They will... join them. Or rather, they will dissolve into them. If we ever see them again, I won't be surprised if instead of their alpha-male general, we see a cute little girl cub who will happily wag her tail at us and show us dozens of cubs of her own. And her memories of being a war criminal will be something like an old, unimportant dream.""

The bird alien shivered. ""Have you ever seen such a thing?""

The human took a long gaze at the space behind the bay's force field. ""The... creature... who took them from the courtroom... used to be a resurrected clone of our ancient, most infamous war criminal.""",5,1764302360.0,humansarespaceorcs,4,1.0,False

The issue is, she's a very nice lady, but legitimately has everything she could ever want. Their house has a very clean aesthetic (all black and white, no photos, no clutter) and is practically a show room. She has lots of things for hobbies like a Cricuit, sewing machine, etc, but does not use any of them. She loves Disney, Lululemon, and being generally on trend with things, but again, has everything she could want. She is not a lady interested in personalized items, picture frames, etc., nor is she particularly adventurous in activites (her family's words not mine), trying new restaurants , nor spas. Food gifts give me hesitation, as I've given nice bags of coffee and candy before but she has not consumed them yet. She always looks very put together and loves doing her hair - last year I got her a Dae hair set and think that was a hit but not really sure. Ideally I think she'd love a Dyson but that's a bit out of my budget.

I’m hoping to meet some new people who share similar interests or just enjoy good conversation. I’m an American girl with a cozy-but-witchy vibe — think books, gardening, crystals, curiosities, taxidermy, and horror movies. If there’s a farmers market, antique shop, or oddities booth in the area, chances are I’m wandering around it with a coffee in hand.

I love fostering animals, exploring local events, and connecting with people who appreciate a mix of earthy, spooky, and artsy energy.

Hopefully you:
- white
- Tall
- Good looking 
- Can make me laugh
- Dominant in a cheeky way
- Have an interesting career
- Can hold a conversation and flirt
- Between 28-38 years old 

If any of that sounds like your vibe too, feel free to message me.

It smelled when burning and used 2 tablets to get 12 ounces of water hot enough to make a cup of coffee. I was not impressed. Then I realized that stove and tablets was rather old, maybe 20 years old, really don't remember when I got it.

All the bad points, It produces noxious fumes. It can not be used inside, not even in a dire emergency could this fuel be used to heat a tent or vehicle. Leaves a sticky residue on bottom of pans. The residue washes off easily or rubbed off in sand or dirt. Performance of stove is similar to alcohol stove, not great. Stove works well to heat something but not good for cooking.

The good points, they can be stored years, can't spill or leak like alcohol or white gas stoves. No canister to worry about leaving in vehicle or how much fuel in canister. See the tablets you know you have fuel.  Depending on stove, twigs could be used with or in place of tablets. Cohglans stove with tablets is rather compact,

I like the stove enough I have used it several more times to make coffee and have bought more tablets. The applications for this stove are limited but for a 8 dollar stove with fuel that can be stored years in vehicle and still work, this stove is may be an option.",5,1764301567.0,preppers,3,1.0,False

So I have few questions so maybe you can help me with this, and my questions are:

1- is the price to good to be true or not ( on facebook marketplace) ?

2- what should I be asking him about to make sure that the ps5 is fully functioning other than going online on the market to make sure that the console is not banned.

3- Should I bring anything with me such as usb, power bank, portable monitor…. Etc, to test the ps5 or not ?

4- where should we meet?. for now I’m going to ask him to meet in Tim Hortons or another coffee shop such as Starbucks

We're in our mid to late twenties.

We met on a lesbian dating app, she likes me first and then we match. She initates the flirting, asks me questions and calls me cute.

She went dry once (hadn't responded in a few days) and I double texted. She gave me her number, encouraging me to double text because she gets caught up. I text it, we chat, send reaction memes, and I ask her out

The date went really well. Lots of chemistry, extended the date, went out for italian food, brought me a book, held hands, flirted openly, SHE broke the touch barrier, and she asks to kiss me, strokes my hair

She mentions at the end of the date for a second one, then she tells me again over text that she'd love to take me out again and how endearing I was. 

It went dry for several days, she says she sick and asks me if I'm okay with postponing. Which i believe, cause my city had a ton of cases

Ive double texted one other time or two, she's replied but this time it's been almost two weeks and no answer. 

One thing I will say that keeps me from assuming the worst and moving on, is that she's a professor teaching about 4 to 5 classes, and I as a (she's not my professor)student, know that this is the busiest time of year for college. Projects due, papers and exams. When she replied saying she was sick she told me she had about 300 papers she had to get into.

When she does get back to me, she asks how my week has been and things. On one hand, everyone has their phone, but on another she seems extremely busy, 10 hour shifts, grading then office hours, this was just one date she has no obligation to me

But, she did make time for me for our date, was very engaged and in my interests and set the whole thing up, and I don't want to triple text her especially on Thanksgiving and the break

I'm working 36 hours a week and in 5 classes, and I feel like dying, so I can truly imagine her end. She works 10 hours a day

TLDR: We met on a dating app, she initates the flirting, and has gone dry. She slipped her number to me, saying she encourages me to double text and she gets caught up. we move off the app, some convo then I ask her out. Our coffee date is filled with chemistry, laughs, nerdy convos, she breaks the touch barrier, suggests italian food (which she offered to pay for, but I didnt let her), we move to a bookstore to talk about our interests, she buys a book, we hold hands, we flirt, and at the end of the date she initates a kiss and plays with my hair. She suggests a 2nd date in person and again over text. 

She's a professor, teaching 4 or 5 classes, and she has been open about how her job is extremely busy. Its been 15 days since I double texted, and there hasn't been a response. I'm assuming she won't get back to me, but I don't want to triple text, but at the same time I'm willing to do that i just don't want to come off as clingy or obsessive. My gut doesn't tell me she's playing with me",1,1764300966.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

1p8kqc1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1p8kqc1/help_me_make_sense_of_this/,Help Me Make Sense of This,"I’m new here and I hope this is germane to the sub. I’ve actually run this by chatGPT in my weaker moments in fact, and it was like, “buddy, even though I’ve been trained on all the knowledge in human history…I can’t help here”. So I decided to try to leverage old school non artificial intelligence. I’ll try to summarize as much as possible but it’s a saga:

Back in January I met a coworker - let’s call her Nikki - on a company Slack channel dedicated to a hobby we’re both passionate about. I work at a large global firm and we’re on totally different teams, and at the time lived in different cities. I was visiting her city that week though and we planned to meet for coffee. We immediately hit it off - we spent about an hour, hour and a half together. It was Friday, I went back to my hometown on Sunday, and then on Monday…she reached out proactively to follow up. I was a little shocked. I typically don’t make that kind of impression. 

That led to some pretty regular online interactions; nothing serious or deep, but we had a ton in common (the aforementioned hobby that first brought us in contact) along with a bunch of other specific, somewhat niche interests. The distance thing was annoying. I visited her office again in march. We met again for coffee, our interactions were easy and warm. It was Friday and I had tickets to a play that weekend - of course I asked if she wanted to join but she quickly declined. “Too tired” was her reason. I was disappointed but when I went back home the online chats picked back up again. 

If anything they gained steam. She visited Western Europe in mid April. Almost every tonight (around 3-5ish my time, which was rather late for her) she’d send me pics: glaciers, mountains, countrysides, that sort of thing. Nothing super personal but…she was on vacation. She was in Europe surrounded by breathtaking natural wonders. And I was on her mind. But I also didn’t have her number, we weren’t connected on social media, and she shot me down the one time I tried to initiate an outside of work meetup. I occasionally tried to be a little bit flirty but within the boundaries of plausible deniability (we were at work after all). 

May came and I visited her city again. I didn’t give a heads up but showed up at her desk…when she was on a phone call. I backed away apologetically but as I retreated embarrassed into the nearby hallway my Slack lights up: “you’re in town!!!” That sentence was like a shot of adrenaline directly to my heart. She came over to my borrowed desk that afternoon and asked me to accompany her to pick up lunch. We ate together at a separate table in the company cafe. All fairly innocent and anodyne but it felt like there was a strong undercurrent of…something. But the ambiguity was killing me. 

In late May Nikki traveled a lot. She purchased WiFi on her flights and would chat with my while in the air. “I’m in a metal tube in the sky - please excuse any typos” became a shared inside joke. But I just was growing impatient. 

There was a woman in the city I lived in who I’d always sort of felt a chemistry with; let’s call her Chrissy. We hooked up in early late May and immediately booked a trip out of town together and named our relationship (the less said about these decisions the better, but they happened). I thought it might help with Nikki though: I worried she might be cautious with me because she didn’t want to lead me on or something. If I wasn’t single then maybe she’d just hang out after work more comfortably. 

We had an undeniably easy rapport and Nikki is, objectively, the most fascinating 240+ volt brain person I’d met in decades: impossible to be bored around, all crackle and current, like a live wire. Just constant sparks, everything she touches starts to buzz a little. I figured if I was definitively take  it would make our interactions easier because she wouldn’t be uncomfortable or worried I had ulterior motives for wanting to be around her. Sure, I find her attractive. But not everyone is a good match romantically - I figured we could at least be friends and that wouldn’t be bad at all. 

I posted a couple pictures on public channels in our company with Chrissy. Nothing overtly couple-y but they were pics of us traveling together. Nikki visited the office in my city in late June. Unlike a few weeks prior she was…skittish, maybe I’d say. She was noncommittal about meeting up despite being there for four whole days. I tried to meet before work to make it easier and she told me “I’m getting to the office at 6:45am”. Felt like a dodge. She ignored me a few times when I tried to arrange a coffee meetup. On day three I casually dropped a “my gf” reference in a message to her. She responded politely, didn’t address the gf thing, and then…promptly stopped speaking to me. We had zero contact at all from late June to late September. 

She’s an art aficionado and a believer in analog books over kindles. Big fan of Mondrian in particular. In September I was visiting her home office but right before I left I went to visit an art museum where I’m a member. For whatever reason, the museum was giving away Mondrian bookmarks to all members who visited. I snagged one and when I went to her office made an impromptu visit to her desk. 

“I want to just apologize” I said sheepishly. “I’m not good at social interactions [this is believable, I’m a tech guy] and I sometimes piss people off without knowing it or even understanding why”. I offered the bookmark as an olive branch. “Oh it’s fine” she said - “I wasn’t mad at you. I just figured you were busy because you never reached out when I got back home so I didn’t want bother you. And then I got busy too”. I paused. 

“That’s still very sweet though”

After a brief thaw of two or so weeks by October we were communicating again frequently. We even had some airplane interactions again; she did a red eye that wasn’t WiFi enabled but she pinged me at 7am when she got in to let me know she’d arrived safely and thank me for keeping her virtual company during her flight delay the prior night. 

In mid November I ran into her randomly on the subway because I’ve since moved to her town. I spotted her on a subway bench and my pulse started racing to a degree that even my Fitbit noticed. It was a completely involuntary reaction and I had to pace for a few seconds before I could work up the nerve to say hello (and even then the first couple seconds were…less than smooth; I might’ve been speaking faster than a carnival barker). I gathered myself though. We rode to work together and it felt like old times - better, in fact. In the spring I kept trying to move things forward and probably wasn’t myself and occasionally our IRL interactions felt stilted. This time things were easy, natural, in sync. We got to the office and she proposed the idea of getting coffee. Obviously I accepted, and we hung out all told about 90 minutes including the commute. It came we both had tickets to the same hockey game that weekend; I told her to message me and meet up. She didn’t give that much attention - “I’ll be there with some old friends, I’m in a totally different section, I’ll prob just wave to you from the nosebleeds” that sort of thing. I was crestfallen. 

The game came and went. She did not, in fact, try to meet even in passing. I trudged home despondent and posted some pics of my game experience on the way. When I got back…a DM from her. It was about game, but still: it was 10:30pm. I didn’t want to seem miffed so I volleyed back. She replied again, which I wasn’t expecting, around 11:30. I sent a follow up message and passed out. When I woke up…messages from her, replying at 1:24am. They were prosaic, about hockey, nothing personal but still. It was a middle of the night message. I couldn’t square that level of comfort with her refusal to meet for a beer at the game. 

That was the last time we interacted. It was this past Sunday. The long slack chats seem to have dried up but she’s DM’d me on instagram (including the hockey convo) a few times. 

I have no idea what happened or where to go from here. I am absolutely attracted to her and just to keep myself honest have in my weaker moments shared the readers digest version of this odyssey along with pics of her with my friends to be like, “am I imagining things - is she way out of my league?” My friends, not ones to ever mince words or protect my feelings, have (sometimes almost begrudgingly) admitted we’re well matched. 

I recently moved to her city (that’s why we ran into each other on the subway). The location thing should no longer be a factor. I’ve been to the library a bunch in recent weeks reading about communication styles but I’m not an expert here. Some of the stuff I’ve read has suggested that I should never, ever bring up my apology or the lengthy period of silence in the summer - that that would drive her away and make her shut down. But I still feel a need to sort of talk this out. I’m plagued by the question of “was I just wishcasting or was some of that soft intimacy of the spring a sign of something deep but slow moving?”. She’s never mentioned a partner, ever, nor spoken much about her dating life. I know she had a pretty traumatic breakup nine years ago and is intensely private (highly curated online presence, four instagram accounts, that sort of thing). 

True to her analog loving mindset, she’s a fan of journaling - she’s got dozens of volumes of books she’s filled up over the years with handwritten memories, which she adds daily. She actually showed me (well, a picture of them) back in April when she slowly began to share more personal details. She always has a little lined notebook and pen on her. 

I’ve been considering buying a nice journal type notebook and filling the first couple pages with my side of the story, and my feelings. In my mind that analog texture and ability to read and review things at her own pace - not on a company computer but not in a tiny IG message square, or in person where there might be pressure - will be the best move but keep me honest. That seems like it would fit her particular personality and communication style. I just have no idea what to do or where to go from here and had to vent because it’s been weighing so heavily on my mind lately. ",0,1764300844.0,dating_advice,1,0.5,False

I'm open to all kinds of conversations—whether you just want someone to listen, enjoy a platonic exchange, or you're feeling a little adventurous, I’m here for it.

About me: I’m known to be fun, especially if you’re the calm and fun type too. I’m well-educated, soft-spoken, and generally considered a nice guy. Not tall, but fit—I run a lot. I’d say I’m fairly good-looking and happy to share a photo. I enjoy reading, watching YouTube, and being outdoors—hiking and weekend walks are my thing. I'm also a huge fan of coffee, chips, chocolate, and ice cream. I don’t drink or smoke, and I prefer one-on-one chats over group settings or parties.

All ages, races, locations, time zones, and relationship statuses are welcome to message me. I just ask that you’re respectful and genuinely want to chat.

What I'm getting at is, if I find a particular grind makes a decent cup in an AP or Moka pot, can that inform me as to where to start for espresso?

I was joyful, eager to behold my mother and my kindred once more. I worked for Captain D again, though this time on the grounds, tending to planting, household work, and running all errands. Yet even here, cruelty followed me. My old master, cruelly and without shame, commanded me to wash him naked in a tub of water; a humiliation I bore in silence.

I was later hired to work at Cedar Hill, earning two dollars and a quarter a week for washing. During my time there, I heard that Mr John Wood was going to Antigua. I asked my master’s permission to go with Mr Wood, who consented to take me in his service, and, later, purchased me for three hundred dollars. In Antigua, my duties were to attend chambers, nurse Mrs Wood’s child, and wash the clothes. However, I soon fell ill with rheumatism, and my body became crippled from the strain. If the Lord hadn’t sent our kind neighbour, Mrs Greene, and her old faithful slave, I fear I should have died.

The Woods were strict and abusive. My mistress spoke to me in ill language, and I was sick of this treatment. A few times, Mr Wood gave me a note to find a buyer, yet proceeded to whip me when I did so. Despite this, I cherished a small hope that some earnest person would buy me, and that, with the money I saved from washing, selling coffee and yams, and other provisions to the captains of ships, I might one day purchase my freedom.

It was around Christmas time of that year that I first encountered the possibility of a community. One day, while we were at Date Hill for a short break from the Woods, a slave woman invited me to a Methodist meeting for prayer, held in her husband’s house. There, for the first time, I understood the prayer, and it left a great impression on my mind, which led me to join the Moravian Church. I tried to go and hear the teachers whenever I had the opportunity, trying not to be caught by my mistress. 

After some time, I met my now husband, Daniel James, who had purchased his freedom from his mistress. When Mr Wood heard of our marriage, he fumed and got frustrated with Daniel. The Woods were fearful that my devotion to my husband might affect my service to them. Even so, amidst the threats of punishment, Antigua offered a fragile hope of freedom and a glimpse of faith and community.",1,1764300310.0,u_og-mary-prince,0,1.0,False

1p8kjjf,https://enjoymediterranean.com/blogs/mediterranean-recipes/sea-wolfs-risotto,Sea Wolf’s Risotto,"The fog hung low over the sea, thick as chowder and twice as cruel. Somewhere beneath its gray breath, a man with salt in his veins and hunger in his belly crouched near the fire. He didn’t cook for pleasure. He cooked to survive, to feed the furnace of his body, to fight off the cold gnawing at his bones. And tonight, he would eat like a goddamn sea wolf.

This ain't no dainty supper. This is for the ones who wrestle the sea, and eat like it. This is Seafood Risotto for the Hard-Bitten and the Hard-Drinking. Rich, fatty, briny as the North Pacific in winter. 

# Ingredients (Feeds 3 ravenous sailors or 1 proper sea wolf)

**The Broth:** 

1 pound shrimp shells, fish bones, crab legs – the sea’s refuse, don’t waste it 

1 onion, halved

2 celery stalks

1 carrot, rough chopped

3 cloves garlic, smashed

A fistful of parsley stems

Salt like the sea

1 tbsp tomato paste

5 shots of brandy (drink three, toss two in)

6 cups water

  
**The Risotto:** 

1 ½ cups Arborio rice – white and starchy like a greenhorn’s soul

1 small onion, finely chopped

4 tbsp butter (two for courage, two for flavor)

[Early harvest olive oil](https://enjoymediterranean.com/products/sopotnik-organic-extra-virgin-olive-oil), the kind that makes your throat itch as if it had been scraped with an iron scraper

1 cup dry white wine – something rough

½ pound scallops

½ pound shrimp, peeled

½ pound mussels or clams, scrubbed like a deck

1 tbsp squid ink (optional, but black as a sailor’s conscience)

½ cup grated aged Parmigiano-Reggiano - stale and calloused, like an old boatswain’s shirt 

Zest of 1 lemon

Cracked black pepper

Chopped parsley to pretend you care about greens

# Method

**1. The Broth – Soul of the Sea**  
In a pot older than your regrets, dump in the shrimp shells, fish bones, and whatever else the tide coughed up. Add your mirepoix - onion, celery, carrot - and smash in the garlic like you're settling a bar fight. Throw in tomato paste, parsley stems, a generous pinch of salt, and that noble shot of brandy. Set the water to boil, then simmer low, like the fire in a vengeful heart. After 45 minutes, strain. Discard the solids. What you have now is liquid gold, ocean-born.

**2. The Risotto – A Dance with the Devil**  
In a heavy-bottomed pan (the kind that’s seen some things), melt your butter and olive oil. Sauté the onion low and slow until it turns translucent like the early morning mist. Stir in the rice. Toast it until you start to think that in a minute it will smell like something’s burning. You’ll know.   
Deglaze with white wine. Don’t spare your wine. Let it hiss. That’s the sound of the sea meeting steel. Stir.

Now begins the ritual: Add broth, one ladle at a time. Stir like a man rowing against a storm. Never stop. When the liquid’s gone, add more. Repeat. Sweat. Curse. Stir. For 20 minutes or more. 

**3. The Bounty**  
When the rice is nearly done - firm, but no longer fighting - toss in the shrimp and scallops. Stir. A minute later, add the mussels or clams. Cover. Let them steam until they yawn open like old sea tales.  
Finish with the rest of the butter, the squid ink if you dare, lemon zest, cheese, pepper, and chopped parsley. Stir until it’s glossy and thick like storm-tossed waves.

**To Serve:**   
Ladle into deep bowls. Eat hot. Eat with a spoon and a snarl. Eat while staring down the wind, remembering the ones who didn’t make it. This risotto is not a dish. It’s a declaration: you’re still alive!  

# What to drink and in what order? 

You don’t sip with this meal. If you drink - you drink.   
Here’s what pairs with your Sea Wolf’s Risotto — something brutal, something briny, something bold enough to punch back. These 5 drinks, in this exact order, will help you bring out the incredibly rich flavor of your dish. 

**1. Navy Strength Gin – Overproof & Unapologetic** 

A pour of Navy Strength gin over ice or neat, depending on how many fingers you still feel. Juniper cuts through the richness. Citrus slaps your tongue awake. It’s what the Royal Navy drank to keep scurvy - and reason - at bay.

! Drink pairing idea: A simple gin and tonic, but double the gin, lime wedge bruised, and sea salt on the rim. Call it The Widowmaker."" 

  
**2. Strong Orange Wine – Natural, Unfiltered, Real**  

Not some subtle fresh Riesling. You want 12 years old, insanely long macerated orange [Sulne](https://enjoymediterranean.com/products/korenika-moskon-sulne) or [Paderno](https://enjoymediterranean.com/products/korenika-moskon-paderno), wines born near the sea, kissed by salt air. Minerality sharp enough to scrape barnacles off your palate.

Drink it cold. Drink it from the bottle. Drink the whole bottle. 

  
**3. Peated Scotch – Smoke from Drowned Souls**

If the night is cold and the sea is angry, pour a Lagavulin, Ardbeg, or Laphroaig. The smoke and iodine wrap around the seafood like a storm wraps around a mast.

Serve neat, in a glass thick enough to crack a skull.

  
**4. Barrel-Aged Rum – The Blood of Old Sailors**

Dark, molasses-heavy, and aged like the myths. A good Navy-style rum (try Pusser’s, Diplomático, or Gosling’s Black Seal) burns hot and lingers like regret.

Add a wedge of charred lime. Or don't. No one will stop you.

  
**5. Beer (To polish to a shine)**

Now it's beer time. Choose it by compass, go heavy and wild:

Belgian Tripel – spicy, yeasty, and 9% evil  
Smoked Porter – tastes like burnt ships and broken dreams  
Gose – tart, salty, and strange, like the sea’s laughter 

5-6 bottles, no more. You have to know your limits. 

  
Bonus:   
End the meal with an Irish coffee and a few shots of grappa. No sugar. No cream. Just grit.  

Drink like the tide’s rising. Or drink like it's your last time. Because maybe it is.

We're all doing the same self help routines, reading the same ""how to win friends"" advice, watching the same charisma coaches on YouTube.

The result? A sea of people who sound like ChatGPT wrote their personality.

I spent months diving deep into research (books, psychology papers, podcasts from actual experts, not just TikTok influencers chasing clout) to figure out what actually makes someone magnetic. And I found something counterintuitive: the most charming people do the OPPOSITE of what conventional advice tells you.

This isn't about manipulation or being fake. It's about understanding the psychology behind genuine connection and using it intentionally. Here's what actually works:

## The psychological principle nobody talks about

Studies in social psychology show that predictability kills attraction. Dr. Robert Cialdini's research on influence reveals that people are drawn to those who create ""pleasant violations of expectations."" When someone acts slightly differently than anticipated, our brains light up with interest.

The problem with most charisma advice is that it makes everyone behave the same way: overly agreeable, constantly positive, always ""on."" This predictability is social death.

## What the opposite game actually means

**When everyone goes high energy, you stay calm**

Research from Stanford's Social Psychological Answers to Real World Questions lab found that emotional contrast creates memorability. If you're at a party where everyone's bouncing off walls, being the collected person who speaks quietly forces people to lean in and pay attention. You become the eye of the storm.

This doesn't mean being boring or aloof. It means having the confidence to not match everyone else's energy level automatically. Professor Adam Galinsky's work on power dynamics shows that people who set their own emotional tone (rather than mirroring others) are perceived as more confident and influential.

**When everyone's agreeable, you challenge**

Now this is where most people screw up. Challenging doesn't mean being a contrarian asshole who argues about everything. Dr. Francesca Gino's research at Harvard Business School found that people who offer ""constructive disagreement"" are rated as more competent and interesting than pure yes-people.

The key is disagreeing on ideas while staying warm toward the person. ""I actually see it differently, here's why..."" is magnetic. ""You're wrong"" is repulsive. The difference matters enormously.

**When everyone shares surface level stuff, you go weirdly specific**

Studies on self disclosure show that moderate vulnerability creates connection, but there's a sweet spot. Research published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology found that sharing unusual, specific details (not trauma dumping, just interesting quirks) makes you more memorable than generic facts.

Instead of ""I like reading,"" try ""I'm obsessed with this one paragraph in a Hemingway book where he describes making coffee, I've read it probably 50 times."" Specific beats generic every single time. It gives people an actual hook to remember you by.

**When everyone's trying to impress, you show genuine curiosity**

This one's backed by decades of research. Psychologist Arthur Aron's famous study on creating intimacy showed that asking progressively deeper questions creates connection faster than any other technique. But here's the thing most people miss: you have to actually care about the answers.

Dr. Charles Duhigg's book ""Supercommunicators"" breaks down how the best conversationalists ask follow up questions that show they're tracking the emotional subtext, not just the facts. ""What was that like for you?"" beats ""That's cool"" every time.

**When everyone's polished, you admit small flaws immediately**

The pratfall effect is real. Research shows that highly competent people become MORE likeable when they reveal minor imperfections. It makes you human instead of intimidating.

I'm not talking about self deprecation or fishing for compliments. Just honest, small admissions. ""I'm terrible with names, tell me yours again?"" or ""I always mess up this story but it's worth it"" makes people relax around you.

## The biggest mistake people make

After studying this stuff obsessively, I realized most ""charisma advice"" fails because it's trying to add things to your personality rather than removing barriers. You don't need to become someone else. You need to stop doing the things that make you forgettable.

Dr. Vanessa Van Edwards analyzed thousands of hours of TED talks and found that the most popular speakers weren't the most polished, they were the most authentic. They varied their delivery, showed genuine emotion, and didn't try to be perfect.

## Resources that actually changed how I interact with people

**Books that rewired my brain about charm:**

* **""The Charisma Myth"" by Olivia Fox Cabane** – This is the best book on presence I've ever read. Cabane worked with everyone from Fortune 500 executives to military leaders. She breaks down charisma into three components (presence, power, warmth) and shows how to develop each one deliberately. The exercises are practical and weirdly effective. This book will make you question everything you think you know about likability.

* **""Supercommunicators"" by Charles Duhigg** – Insanely good read. Duhigg is a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist who spent years researching why some conversations click and others die. He identifies three types of conversations (practical, emotional, social) and shows how mismatches create disconnection. The chapter on matching conversation types alone is worth the price.

* **""Influence"" by Robert Cialdini** – A classic for a reason. Cialdini is the godfather of persuasion research. This isn't manipulation tactics, it's understanding the psychological triggers that make humans respond to each other. If you only read one book on social dynamics, make it this one.

**Podcasts that dropped serious knowledge bombs:**

* **Hidden Brain with Shankar Vedantam** – Every episode dives into psychological research about human behavior. The episodes on first impressions and social connection are gold. Vedantam has a gift for making academic research feel relevant and applicable.

* **The Psychology Podcast with Scott Barry Kaufman** – Kaufman interviews the actual researchers doing groundbreaking work on personality, creativity, and social dynamics. Way more substantive than surface level charisma content. The episode with Angela Duckworth on grit and charm is phenomenal.

* **Hurry Slowly with Jocelyn K. Glei** – Not specifically about charm, but the episodes on presence and attention completely shifted how I show up in conversations. The interview with Priya Parker about gathering is incredible.

**Apps and tools that helped:**

* **BeFreed** – This one's genuinely been essential for going deeper into social psychology research without spending hours hunting for content. It's an AI-powered learning app built by a team from Columbia and Google that generates personalized audio podcasts from books, research papers, and expert interviews based on exactly what you want to learn. I'll literally ask it ""how do conversational patterns create connection"" and it pulls from multiple psychology sources to create a custom 20-minute podcast with real examples. The voice options are crazy good (I switch between the deep Samantha-style voice and an energetic one depending on my mood), and you can pause mid-episode to ask your avatar Freedia follow-up questions. It's been a total replacement for mindless scrolling time, and honestly my mind feels way clearer in conversations now.

* **Readwise** – If you're reading books and articles about social psychology, this app resurfaces the best highlights so the insights actually stick. Spaced repetition for book notes basically. Game changer for retaining what you learn.

* **Notion or Obsidian** – I started keeping a ""social experiments"" journal where I'd try different approaches and track what happened. Sounds nerdy but it helped me notice patterns. You could use any notes app but these make it easy to cross reference observations.

**YouTube channels worth your time:**

* **Charisma on Command** – Yes it's popular, but Charlie Houpert actually backs up his observations with research. The videos analyzing specific people (Margot Robbie, Matthew McConaughey) break down what works in real interactions, not just theory.

* **ThoughtSlime** – Completely different angle, but the videos on authenticity and rejecting social performance culture hit hard. Sometimes the best charm advice is permission to stop performing altogether.

## What actually changed for me

The biggest shift wasn't learning new techniques. It was realizing that being memorably charming means having the confidence to zig when everyone else zags. Not for the sake of being different, but because you're secure enough to be yourself when social pressure says do otherwise.

I'm not perfectly charming now. I still have awkward moments, say dumb things, misread situations. But I'm way more interesting to be around than when I was following a script of ""correct"" behavior. People remember conversations with me. They reach out later. They seem genuinely curious.

The research backs this up but here's the real secret: the opposite game only works if you're still fundamentally kind and interested in others. All the psychological tricks in the world won't save you if people sense you're performing or don't actually care about them.

Charm isn't about manipulation. It's about being secure enough in yourself to break patterns, curious enough to care about others, and self aware enough to calibrate to each situation. These are skills you can develop deliberately if you're willing to do the work and experiment.

The good news is this stuff is way more in your control than you think. Social dynamics aren't magic, they're patterns. Learn the patterns, practice breaking them intentionally, and watch what happens.",3,1764300092.0,OdysseyBookClub,0,1.0,False

1p8khp5,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalkTherapy/comments/1p8khp5/transference_and_hugs_and_rupturesoh_my/,Transference and Hugs and Ruptures…Oh My 🦁🐯🐻,"Alright…here’s what happened. I have been in therapy with my current therapist for nearly 11 months now. We went through a period where we ended nearly every session with a hug, and I LOVED this because I live alone and don’t often get hugs. Well, as one would expect, it made me grow more attached to her (I still wouldn’t say that I have transference in the sense that I’m obsessed with her, but she definitely became a source of safety and comfort to me). About two months ago, she brought up the fact that she noticed I was starting to become attached, and decided then to end hugs in therapy - so no more physical contact at all.

I’ll be honest - I was SUPER upset. I cried for hours after that session, and I almost quit, but I didn’t. We didn’t talk about it after that. It’s bringing up a lot of shame for me, and I feel bad that I ever enjoyed her hugs in the first place. My depression has skyrocketed these past two months, but I’ve been determined not to bring up the hugs again so that she doesn’t think I’m being rebellious about a boundary. 

This week with Thanksgiving, I’ve been feeling extra lonely, and I have found that I can’t quit thinking about how badly I want a hug from her. And yeah, I could see if a friend is available to get coffee, or take a little drive over to my brother or sister’s house, but I really just want HER. And I know that probably sounds dumb, but no one ever hugs me the way she hugged me - long and tight and she would rub my back and just hold me. I’m a grown adult, and I recognize how stupid this all is, but I *really* want a hug.

Do I bring this up? Do I just ignore it? I don’t even know what to do. I know she’s not gonna give me a hug, so it seems like it would be a waste of time to bring it up.

🦁🐯🐻 🦁🐯🐻 🦁🐯🐻 🦁🐯🐻 🦁🐯

For people who have experience with this/therapists/people who want to read more and discuss deeper:

Was that a healthy response from her? Previously, she had initiated a few of the hugs, and had allowed them almost every week for several months before just suddenly cutting them off. Why would she just stop when she realized I was starting to get attached? Isn’t there a better way to work through that? I’m finding that I am MORE attached now because I know she’s out of reach and I’m finding myself trying extra hard to get her to care about me enough to cross that boundary and give me one more hug, which is so unhealthy.


How do I get that comfort in other ways? Hugs from other people just aren’t the same. They don’t feel as safe or as physically comforting.


Has anyone been through something like this with their therapist? How did it work out in the long term? I have had just the most intense feelings towards her these past two months and they’re all over the place from wanting validation and care so badly to being so angry with her, and I don’t know what to do.

Is there hope that I’ll ever get a hug again, or am I just doomed to being touch hungry forever?

Happy Thanksgiving, and thank you!

For six years, Isabella Garcia loved her husband, Joseph Ashford. But out of the blue, he was struck by a strange illness—and the cure? He had to sleep with another woman ninety-nine times.
The Ashford family has a century-old family creed: the head of the family must not marry a woman of humble birth.
But Joseph defied tradition. He burned the ancestral tablets to marry Isabella, a pearl diver, adding her to the family tree overnight and rushing into their wedding the very next day.
For five years, he spoiled her, making her the most envied woman in Coastal Harbor.
But in the sixth year, Joseph was struck by a strange illness and fell into a coma.
A mysterious master claimed it was an ancestral punishment. The only way to lift it was through a ritual marriage—where Joseph had to sleep with a ritual bride, Sophia Miller, ninety-nine times or fall into a coma again.
From then on, Joseph slept with Sophia every night, telling Isabella to wait.
Isabella could only kneel and pray for him, listening tearfully as he was intimate with another woman.
After seven days of kneeling, she returned home with a protective charm. Just as she was about to open the door, she overheard a conversation between Joseph and his friends.
\*\*\*\*\*
""Joseph, you're a genius. Faking an illness and making up a ritual marriage just to openly bring your little lover home to fool around.""
""Only someone from a humble background like Isabella would believe it. Everyone in Coastal Harbor know that our Joseph fears nothing, not even burning the ancestral memorial tablets? How could he possibly believe in some master and a ritual marriage?""
The blood in Isabella's body seemed to reverse its flow.
So Joseph wasn't sick at all; this was all his scheme!
The protective charm clutched tightly in her hand suddenly felt scorching hot, as if it would burn right through her palm.
His friend couldn't help but ask curiously: ""Joseph, you've slept with Sophia 90 times, right? Just 9 more times and the ritual marriage will be over. What are you planning to do then...""
Joseph leaned back on the sofa, his black shirt unbuttoned by two, his long legs crossed.
He took a light sip of his drink and curled his lip nonchalantly: ""When it's over, I'll just keep her on the side.""
Standing outside the door, Isabella felt a chill that pierced her to the bone.
But his friends just laughed louder: ""We told you—men like us all have someone on the side. Don't be so naive.
You've been faithful to Isabella for five years, you've done right by her.""
""A woman like Sophia, who looks innocent but has a wild side and no inhibitions in bed, is such a turn-on for men.""
""By the way, Joseph, isn't she much more fun than Isabella?""
The glass slammed heavily on the table, and Joseph's drunken eyes suddenly turned sharp.
""No one can compare to Isabella. She will always be the one I love the most.""
Everyone was stunned.
After a long moment, a friend couldn't help but speak up, asking a question Isabella also desperately wanted to know: ""Joseph, if you love her, how could you bear to make her suffer by faking an illness?
I heard the Ashford family has given her a hard time these past three months, and Madam Ashford almost subjected her to family disciplinary punishment...""
The air was silent for a few seconds.
Then, Joseph's deep voice came through—
""The Ashford family is a clan with a hundred years of prestige. To enter my family, even the daughter from an old money family must undergo a test to prove her loyalty.
Back then, I made an exception and didn't make Isabella go through this formality, and the family has always had objections.""
""Now, I'm using this ritual marriage affair to make up for it.""
She doesn't even fight or make a scene when I sleep with someone else, and even sincerely prays for me.”
“That shows she's obedient and submissive enough, worthy of being part of the Ashford family.”
He let out a soft chuckle, his voice laced with a self-righteous tenderness: “As for the suffering she's endured for me, I'll make it up to her with a lifetime of devotion.”
Those words pierced Isabella's heart like needles.
She suddenly laughed.
As she laughed, tears streamed down her cheeks.
Everyone in the Ashford family said that because she insisted on marrying into the family, Joseph was struck down by an ancestral punishment and fell ill.
For the past three months, she had lived every day amidst insults and condemnation.
During the first few days of Joseph's coma, she was so heartbroken and cried so violently that she nearly lost sight in her right eye. She also developed a chronic ache in her heart, lying awake night after night.
When he was in bed with Sophia, she was kneeling before a cross, reciting the Rosary again and again, refusing to stop even when her fingers were rubbed raw and bleeding...
But it turned out... all of it was a lie!
The ridiculous rules of a century-old prestigious family, the so-called necessary test of loyalty...
All of it was just a grand-sounding excuse!
In essence, he just wanted to have his affair without restraint, while avoiding the judgment of his former self.
Tears blurred Isabella's vision. She didn't understand how things had come to this.
Joseph... he had loved her so genuinely, so clearly.
Back then, to pay for her mother's medical treatments, she had given up college and started diving for pearls to earn money. It was then she'd accidentally saved Joseph, who had been seriously injured and fallen into the sea while being pursued.
She took him home and cared for him for a month. To her surprise, Joseph fell madly in love with her and began to pursue her with passionate intensity.
She didn't believe in true love from a wealthy family and rejected him time and again. But he was relentlessly persistent, refusing to give up, using all his patience and gentleness to slowly melt her frozen heart.
What truly won her over was when Joseph shielded her from the sulfuric acid a competitor threw at her. A hideous scar was burned across his back, and though he was drenched in a cold sweat from the pain, he smiled and wiped away her tears: “As long as you're okay, that's all that matters.”
At their wedding, he knelt on one knee, held her hand, and vowed: “Isabella, I will love only you for the rest of my life. I will never let you suffer even the slightest bit of wrong.”
The words still echoed in her ears, now a bitter irony.
Isabella's tears had run dry, but the chatter and laughter in the living room continued.
Suddenly, someone sighed. “Joseph, Isabella has been Mrs. Ashford for five years. She's no fool. Aren't you afraid that if she finds out about Sophia... she'll leave you?”
Joseph was silent for a moment, his Adam's apple bobbing. “Then we'll just never let her know. Keep your mouths shut.”
His friend fell silent, but still asked cautiously, “What if she finds out... and wants a divorce?”
Joseph's lips curled into a smirk. “She loves me too much. How could she ever bear to leave me?”
“Besides, in all of Coastal Harbor, who would dare help her file for divorce without my consent?”
“And even if she did manage to run—” his gaze turned suddenly sharp, “I'd drag her back!
She's in the Ashford family tree. In this life, she's mine, in life and in death. She can only stay by my side.”
Isabella's breath hitched, her nails digging deep into her arm.
Joseph, you're wrong!
What makes you think I'd still love you after you've played me for a fool?
And what makes you think I can't leave you?
Isabella wiped her tears and, without a moment's hesitation, threw the Protective charm in her hand into the trash.
Then, she left without a word and did two things.
First, she went to her mother and told her about Joseph's affair.
Isabella's mother sighed deeply after hearing the story. ""I was against you marrying into a wealthy family back then. He knelt before me for ten days and nights, refusing to leave even after the rain gave him a high fever that turned into pneumonia. He wouldn't go to the hospital until I gave him my blessing. I truly thought he was a good man, but I never expected... Isabella, Mom supports you. Let's leave together.""
Second, she took her mother to begin the process of erasing their legal identity and changed her name.
Since Joseph said her name was in the family tree, and that she couldn't escape the Ashford family in life or death, she would make it so the person ""Isabella"" no longer existed in this world.
The process of erasing one's legal identity would take half a month. Isabella told her mother to wait patiently. She had to return to the Ashford family first, stay by Joseph's side, and not let him suspect anything was wrong.
Otherwise, with his methods, neither of them would be able to escape.
Isabella returned to the villa.
Unexpectedly, the moment she walked in, she saw a scene that felt like a blow to the head.
Joseph was on top of Sophia, riding her on the sofa. And what Sophia was wearing—
was her wedding dress!
Chapter 2
Chapter 2
The keys slipped from Isabella's hand, clattering to the floor.
Joseph frowned and turned his head. When he saw it was Isabella, he froze.
He quickly buckled his belt and zipped up his pants. By the time he looked up again, any trace of panic was gone from his face, replaced by the calm composure of a man in power.
""Isabella... why are you home?""
He asked with a smile.
Isabella's hand dug into her arm, pinching so hard it hurt.
After a long moment, she heard her own faint voice.
""Am I not allowed to come home now?""
Joseph chuckled. ""That's not what I meant. Weren't you at the church getting a protective charm for me?
Why are you back so suddenly?""
As he spoke, he raised his hand to stroke Isabella's hair, but she dodged him.
Joseph's smile froze on his face. ""Are you angry?
Just because I let Sophia wear one of your dresses?""
""One... dress.""
Isabella's voice trembled as she looked at Joseph in disbelief.
That was her most cherished wedding dress. She had sewn every single pearl on it by hand. Once, the first time she wore it, Joseph's eyes had been filled with awe. ""Isabella, you're so beautiful. This dress is worthy only of you.
From now on, you have to wear it for me every year.""
But now, he had let another woman wear it... and even do that kind of thing in it!
Isabella stared intently into his eyes, searching for a hint of guilt, but all she saw was a glaring sense of ease.
Her heart felt as if it had been violently squeezed, and the pain made it almost impossible for her to stand.
Was Joseph so certain... that she was so desperately in love with him that she would tolerate anything he did?
Joseph took a step forward, held Isabella's trembling hand, and softened his tone. ""Alright, don't be angry. I'll give you a hundred million. Go buy whatever you want.""
A flash of jealousy crossed Sophia's eyes. She suddenly knelt before Isabella, tears instantly welling up. ""Mrs. Ashford, I'm so sorry... It's all my fault. I just loved this wedding dress so much, and Mr. Ashford let me try it on...""
Though her words were an apology, every syllable stabbed at Isabella's heart, as if telling her: See how much he pampers me.
Sophia shot Isabella a triumphant glance, then began to cry even harder, ""Mrs. Ashford, please don't be angry, I'll take it off and give it back to you right now...""
Isabella's gaze swept over the glaring stain on the hem of the dress, and she said lightly, ""It's already dirty. I don't want it. You can keep it.""
Joseph frowned deeply, his voice grave, ""Isabella, don't be ridiculous. How can you just give away a wedding dress?""
Isabella curled her lip, just about to speak.
Just then, Joseph's phone rang.
He glanced at the caller ID, then looked at Sophia.
Sophia immediately forced an understanding smile: ""Mr. Ashford, don't mind me. Go ahead and take it.""
Joseph shook his head and said softly, ""You always get a headache when you hear me talk about business. I'll take this outside. Stop kneeling, get up first.""
With that, he stepped out.
Isabella stood frozen, her heart feeling as if it had been brutally pierced by a dull knife.
He never used to discuss business outside, as it involved trade secrets, but now he could even change that habit for Sophia,.
Only Isabella and Sophia were left in the living room.
Sophia patted her dress and stood up, the weakness on her face instantly transforming into arrogant provocation.
""You don't know, do you?
Joseph's strange illness was faked.""
She leaned in with a light laugh, ""It was all just to use the excuse of a ritual marriage to ward off misfortune, to bring me in legitimately.""
""We've been together for over a year, we've tried everything. Just because I said I hadn't tried having fun at his home yet, he immediately got 'sick'...""
""Isabella, his body and heart are with me now. What do you have besides the title?""
Isabella gave her a cool glance, ""The title can be yours too.""
Sophia froze, then grew furious: ""Who needs you to give it up!
He was mine to begin with!
The position you're occupying will be mine sooner or later!""
Seeing Isabella remain unmoved, she turned pale with anger.
Just then, the sound of Joseph's approaching footsteps came from outside the door.
A vicious look flashed in Sophia's eyes. She suddenly picked up the scalding hot teapot from the coffee table without hesitation, and smashed it against herself!
""Ah—!""
A shrill scream rang out as Sophia staggered and fell to the ground, her fair chest scalded red and covered in blisters.
She then struggled to crawl to Isabella's feet, crying and trembling: ""Mrs. Ashford, I was wrong, I shouldn't have worn your dress, please let me go...""
When Joseph rushed in, this was the scene that greeted him.
His face darkened instantly. He narrowed his eyes at Isabella, ""I've already compensated you. How dare you still hurt her? Apologize to her!""
""I didn't do it. I won't apologize.""
Isabella said calmly.
""Making excuses, are you?""
A dangerous glint flickered in Joseph's eyes, ""Fine. I'll make you admit it.""
Isabella was dragged to the sauna by bodyguards.
The moment the glass door was locked, the hot air felt like countless fine needles pricking her skin.
The needle on the thermometer climbed steadily.
50°C...
60°C...
70°C...
Isabella's face was flushed crimson, the steam making it hard for her to breathe.
Joseph stood outside the door, toying with the wedding ring on his finger, and asked in a low voice, ""Still not admitting it?""
Isabella threw herself against the door, pounding on it desperately. Her palms sizzled from the heat, leaving bloody handprints on the glass that evaporated in an instant.
“It really wasn't me, Joseph!
Why don't you check the security footage?”
She struggled in panic.
“No need. Sophia wouldn't lie to me. You, on the other hand, are becoming more and more disobedient.”
Joseph didn't look up, asking again: “Will you admit you were wrong?”
Isabella's body trembled uncontrollably. Joseph's favoritism for his lover had actually reached this point.
Her heart felt like it was tearing apart from the pain in the intense heat. She really couldn't take it anymore!
“I admit it...”
Her throat was cracked and dry as she rasped, forcing out the words and lying to him for the first time: “I was wrong.”
Joseph curled his lips in satisfaction, raising a hand slightly to signal the bodyguards to stop.
Isabella was let out, drenched in sweat, her body temperature alarmingly high.
Joseph looked at her wretched state, touching her chapped lips soothingly: “If you had just admitted your mistake earlier, you wouldn't have had to suffer.”
“You don't have to apologize to Sophia anymore, but—” His eyes darkened. “Don't let it happen again.”
Her vision darkened. Isabella's body went limp and she collapsed. The burned skin on her body stung fiercely, but the pain in her heart was even worse.
Tears streamed down her face uncontrollably.
She had a congenital heart condition; it was already a miracle she had lived this long.
Before, Joseph used to be so worried about her, not even letting the servants make a sound for fear of startling her.
He once held her and said: “You are my life. I can't let you get hurt in any way.”
But now, he had locked her in a room with life-threatening heat that could kill her at any moment.
It turned out that promises were only real the moment they were spoken.
Chapter 3
Chapter 3
Leaning against the wall, Isabella stumbled her way upstairs.
As soon as she entered her room, she pulled out everything related to Joseph.
The photos and love letters she once treasured, the postcards bought on their trips together...
She picked up an old sketchbook, and her movements suddenly froze.
It was something Joseph had drawn by hand, chronicling every step of their love story.
The first page: their first meeting by the sea. She had saved a blood-soaked Joseph, and he had fallen for her at first sight.
The tenth page: the first time he took her to the Ashford family home. Joseph's mother had told her to enter through the doggy door. She had turned and left, but Joseph chased after her, apologizing over and over: “Isabella, it's my fault. I didn't protect you. I let you be wronged. I promise it will never happen again.”
That time, he sent his mother to a mountain retreat for half a year.
The twentieth page: he announced in front of the entire clan that he would marry her. Grandfather Ashford dragged him to the ancestral hall, warning him that if he violated the family creed, he should beware of ancestral punishment.
Isabella would never forget that day. Joseph had sneered, throwing the ancestral memorial tablets into the fire and declaring in front of everyone: “I'm the head of the family now, so I make the rules. What do the ancestors matter?”
But now...
He was using “ancestral punishment” as an excuse to bring his lover into their home.
Isabella clutched the sketchbook tightly, suddenly remembering Grandfather Ashford's warning before their marriage:
“My grandson only likes obedient dogs. If you want to stay by his side, you have to be willing to be a good dog!”
At the time, she hadn't believed it, thinking Grandfather Ashford was just trying to scare her and break them up.
Now, she was beginning to understand. Joseph was the one in power; he only liked puppets who would obey him absolutely and depend on him forever.
And she, Isabella, would be no one's possession!
Without another moment of hesitation, she threw everything into the fireplace.
The moment she turned, she slammed right into Joseph's deep gaze.
He stared at the dancing flames, his voice devoid of emotion:
""What are you burning?""
Isabella lowered her eyes, her voice faint. ""Just some things I don't want anymore.""
Joseph nodded casually, taking out a first-aid kit to treat her wound. ""You see? Even after punishing you, your husband still dotes on you the most, coming to treat you himself.""
His hands were warm and dry, his movements gentle, but every inch of skin he touched felt bone-chillingly cold.
""Isabella, it's your mother's birthday in three days, . I plan to throw a grand celebration, inviting all the elites of Coastal Harbor.""
Isabella said faintly, ""There's no need. My mother doesn't like those kinds of occasions.""
""No.""
Joseph gently ruffled her hair, but his tone left no room for refusal. ""Be good. I must let everyone see just how much I spoil you.""
Isabella lowered her eyes, feeling no gratitude, only exhaustion.
Three days later.
The banquet was held at the largest hotel under the Ashford group, and nearly all of Coastal Harbor's high society was in attendance.
""Mr. Ashford spoils Mrs. Ashford so much, spending billions on his mother-in-law's birthday!""
""Mr. Ashford is truly the perfect man. I'm so jealous of Mrs. Ashford!""
""...""
Everyone was discussing how much Joseph doted on his wife.
But in a corner, Isabella's mother looked at the burn on Isabella's hand, her eyes red-rimmed. ""My daughter, you've suffered. Just hold on for another half a month, and Mom will take you away.""
Isabella's nose tingled, and she desperately wanted to cry, but fearing Joseph would notice something was wrong, she tilted her head back, forcing the tears to retreat.
Joseph took a call, then walked towards them.
""Isabella, Sophia said she wants to come celebrate your mother's birthday too...""
""I don't want to see her.""
Isabella said coldly.
Joseph's brow furrowed. ""Don't make a scene. She's already on her way. Don't you give her a hard time later.""
With that, he turned and left, his gaze fixed on the entrance, not sparing Isabella another glance.
Isabella stood there, stunned, her heart feeling as if a piece had been brutally gouged out.
Isabella's mother couldn't bear to watch anymore and pulled her out to the terrace.
The night wind was biting, bone-chillingly cold.
Isabella's motherpicked up a coat and draped it over her. ""Daughter, look, the moonlight is beautiful tonight. It will probably be a sunny day tomorrow.""
Isabella said softly, ""I hope so...""
Before the words had even faded, a rush of hurried footsteps approached.
Joseph's face was dark, and he seized her wrist, his grip so tight it nearly crushed her bones. ""Sophia has gone missing. Did you kidnap her?
Speak!
Where is she?""
Isabella's face turned pale with pain, but she straightened her back and met his gaze. ""It wasn't me.""
Joseph stared at her for a few seconds, then gave a cold smile. ""Fine. You won't admit it, will you? I'll make you talk!""
The cruelty that flashed in his eyes sent a chill down Isabella's spine.
Immediately after, he ordered sharply, ""Get me someone in here!
Take her mother away!""
Bodyguards immediately stepped forward and began to drag Isabella's mother out forcefully.
""Joseph, let my mother go!
Where are you taking her?""
Isabella tried to stop them frantically, but the man held her wrist in a death grip.
No matter how she struggled and cried out, Joseph didn't loosen his grip in the slightest.
In the opulent banquet hall.
Isabella was forced to her knees on the cold marble floor.
Joseph leaned back on the leather sofa, his long legs crossed. He took a slow drag from his cigarette, and through the swirling smoke, his cold voice emerged.
""Where is Sophia?""
Isabella shook her head numbly.
She couldn't remember how many times Joseph had asked her this. But she hadn't done it. She really didn't know.
Joseph stood up, stubbed out his cigarette, and forced Isabella's chin up. ""You're so disobedient.""
He beckoned with a finger. A bodyguard leaned over and handed him a phone, on which he played a video.
In the video, Isabella's mother was tied to a chair with a time bomb strapped to her chest. The numbers on the countdown timer ticked down relentlessly.
Chapter 4
Joseph's tone was deceptively gentle, but his gaze was as sharp as ice. ""Isabella, I'm only giving you a final fifty minutes.""
Isabella's face turned deathly pale.
She asked, trembling, ""If I can't find Sophia, will you really kill my mom?""
He leaned in close, his dark pupils reflecting her trembling form. ""You can try me.""
Isabella shuddered, and the tears she had been holding back for so long finally streamed down.
""Joseph, that's my mother! She's the most important person to me!
You can't do this to her!""
He let out a soft chuckle, but his eyes were terrifyingly cold. ""But Sophia is the most important person to me, too.""
""The most important?""
Isabella looked at him in disbelief. ""More important than me and my mom?""
Joseph's expression didn't change. ""Sophia gave me her first time. The poor girl offered herself in a ritual marriage to ward off misfortune and save me. I owe her a debt.
As for you, you will always be the one I love most.
How many times have I told you? I was going to send her away after the ritual marriage was over. Couldn't you just wait?
Did you have to go after her?""
Isabella stared at Joseph, a bone-chilling cold spreading through her chest.
The one he loved most?
Would the man who loved her most fake an illness for his mistress, deceive her, and even threaten to kill her mother?
Isabella had no patience to play along with his act. She was just about to expose his lies.
Suddenly, a bodyguard burst in, shouting, ""Mr. Ashford, we've found Ms. Miller!""
Joseph grabbed his suit jacket and headed for the door.
""What about my mom?""
Isabella lunged forward, desperately grabbing his pant leg. ""Let her go!""
Joseph glanced back over his shoulder, his gaze cold. ""The abandoned warehouse in the east district. Go find her yourself.""
Isabella bolted out the door like a madwoman, speeding all the way to the east district.
When she found her mother, she saw the bomb on her was still counting down!
Joseph hadn't even sent anyone to disarm it!
The ticking of the timer sounded like a death knell. There was only one minute left!
Isabella ripped the tape from her mother's mouth and tried to untie the ropes with trembling hands, but she couldn't get them loose.
""Daughter, forget about me! You have to go—"" Isabella's mother shook her head frantically.
Tears streamed down Isabella's face in panic. ""Mom, I won't leave you...""
Suddenly, Isabella's mother shoved her away with all her might, kicked her feet hard against the ground, and threw herself backward, chair and all—
Isabella let out a heart-wrenching scream: ""Mom—!""
A deafening explosion erupted, and the blast wave threw her violently through the air.
Isabella crashed hard onto the ground, her vision filled with nothing but red.
The hospital.
Isabella's mother was critically injured. Although she had survived, she might never wake up.
Isabella knelt by the hospital bed, tears streaming down her face: ""Mom, I'm so sorry, this is all my fault...""
She apologized over and over, but the person on the bed never responded.
Isabella's heart ached as if it were being torn apart.
Just a few hours ago, her mother had been smiling, holding her hand tightly, and comforting her in a soft voice.
But now, she could only lie here, completely still.
And all of this was caused by the man who claimed to love her!
Isabella cried until her voice was hoarse, finally passing out completely.
When she opened her eyes again.
Isabella found her hand being held. Joseph was by her bedside, his voice incredibly soft:
""I'm sorry, Isabella, it was all a misunderstanding. Sophia's phone just died, that's why she was unreachable.""
""I acted rashly.""
Isabella coldly pulled her hand back, a wave of icy sarcasm washing over her heart.
This was the man who said he loved her most?
Just because Sophia didn't answer her phone, he kidnapped her mother without even checking!
""Isabella, don't be angry. After all, you've targeted her before, that's why I suspected you..."" Joseph's eyes were red, his voice low and hoarse. ""Why don't you hit me, or curse me, anything you want...""
Bang—
The hospital room door was suddenly pushed open, and Sophia burst in, her eyes swollen like peaches: ""Mrs. Ashford, it's all my fault, please don't blame Mr. Ashford...""
She fell to her knees, weeping gracefully: ""If only I had charged my phone in time, Mr. Ashford wouldn't have been so worried about me that he kidnapped your mother, and she wouldn't be in this state...""
Isabella's nails dug fiercely into her palm. Sophia was clearly here to provoke her!
Just as she was about to throw them out, she saw Joseph bend down to help Sophia up, his tone gentle: ""This has nothing to do with you. Stop crying, it's not good for you.""
Watching this scene, Isabella's heart felt cold and bitter.
How ironic. Her mother had almost died and was still unconscious from serious injuries, yet he was worried about another woman ""crying.""
""Get out!""
Isabella's voice was hoarse. ""Both of you, get out!""
Joseph was stunned: ""Isabella...""
""Get lost!""
She suddenly grabbed the vase from the bedside table and smashed it violently on the floor.
Joseph stood up. ""Isabella, calm down first. I'll make it up to you in a few days.""
With that, he left, shielding Sophia as he went.
The moment the door closed, Isabella could no longer hold back and burst into tears.
She didn't want any compensation...
She didn't want anything, only for her mother to open her eyes and look at her one more time.
Chapter 5
Chapter 5
Over the next few days, Joseph tried all sorts of ways to win Isabella's favor.
The latest jewelry, limited-edition bags, flowers flown in from abroad... but Isabella didn't even glance at them.
Until Joseph brought in a titan of the medical world—Dr. Peter.
""Mrs. Ashford, the bomb only caused superficial wounds. Your mother is in a coma because she hit her head on a rock. As long as we perform a craniotomy, she should wake up in about a week. However, this surgery is extremely dangerous, and I'm the only one in the world who can perform it.""
Isabella was ecstatic, thanking him repeatedly.
Dr. Peter waved his hand. ""I stopped operating a long time ago.""
""If Mr. Ashford hadn't given up fifty percent of his profits and stood in the rain outside my house all night, I would never have made an exception.""
Isabella looked at Joseph, her expression complicated.
After a long silence, she said in a low voice, ""Thank you, Mr. Ashford.""
Joseph froze, a flicker of hurt in his eyes. ""Isabella, stop this... Don't treat me like this, okay?""
Isabella turned her head, avoiding his gaze.
In the past, whenever he made her angry, he would humble himself just like this to coax her, and Isabella would always soften and forgive him.
But this time was different.
He had nearly killed her mother. She couldn't forgive him.
During the surgery, Joseph stayed by Isabella's side, never leaving for a moment.
He sat with her on the hallway bench, handing her water and food, occasionally squeezing her hand and comforting her softly, ""Don't be afraid. Mom will be fine.""
Isabella suddenly remembered the year they had just married, when her mother had surgery. He had been just as gentle and patient with her then.
Gazing at the soft profile of his face, she was lost in a daze for a moment, as if everything had gone back to how it was before.
If only he didn't reek of Sophia's perfume.
Isabella's mother surgery was success.
The next day, Isabella was heading out to buy some daily necessities.
But she was stopped in the parking lot.
It was Sophia.
She smiled dazzlingly. ""Do you really think Joseph cares about you and your mother?
Let me tell you, the day your mother was unconscious, he was in high spirits. He pinned me down and took me three times. We went at it until dawn.""
Isabella was already dead inside. ""What do you want?""
""I want you to step aside.""
""Soon.""
Isabella looked at her calmly. ""I will step aside completely.""
Sophia narrowed her eyes, her thoughts unreadable. Just as Isabella thought she believed her, the next moment, Sophia suddenly threw herself against the front of the car and collapsed to the ground, covered in blood.
Isabella was completely stunned. The car wasn't even on. Even if it had hit her, it wouldn't have been this severe.
So where did all that blood on her come from?
Before Isabella could figure it out, Joseph had already rushed over.
Sophia smiled weakly at him. ""Mr. Ashford, don't blame Mrs. Ashford. She's just in a bad mood because of her mother...""
Before she could finish, Sophia violently coughed up a mouthful of blood and fainted.
Without a word, Joseph dragged Isabella out of the car and raised his hand, delivering a resounding slap!
Smack!
Isabella's head snapped to the side, a ringing in her ears.
""Isabella!
Didn't I already get Dr. Peterson to cure your mother?
Why are you still taking it out on Sophia?""
""She threw herself onto the car.""
Isabella replied coldly.
""Still lying!""
Joseph's gaze was as cold as a blade. ""How could Sophia possibly throw herself onto your car?""
He gave her no chance to explain, directly ordering his men to tie her down for a blood donation.
As Isabella was forcibly held down in the donation chair, she was still struggling. ""There are security cameras!
Go check the footage...""
""Don't try to stall.""
Joseph cut her off coldly, his eyes sinister. ""If anything happens to Sophia, I'll make your mother pay with her life.""
Hearing his threat, Isabella abruptly stopped struggling, her hands falling helplessly to her sides.
When the needle pierced her vein, the pain made her fingertips tremble.
But the pain in her heart was a thousand, ten thousand times worse.
She had always been terrified of needles. In the past, whenever she had her blood drawn, Joseph would cover her eyes and coax her softly, ""Be good, Isabella. It'll be over in a second.""
But now, he only stared at the blood bag, relentlessly urging the nurse: ""Faster!
Draw it faster!""
Completely ignoring her pale face and cold body.
The blood bag gradually filled, and her vision blurred bit by bit.
When they reached 800cc, the nurse couldn't help but speak up: ""This young lady has a heart condition. If you keep drawing blood, her heart won't be able to take it. She could go into cardiac arrest...""
Joseph looked at Isabella's bloodless face, his fingertips trembled, but he still gave the cold order:
""Continue.""
Isabella closed her eyes in despair. So, he really didn't care if she lived or died.
In that moment, her heart died completely!
A wave of dizziness washed over her. The last thing she saw was Joseph's back as he rushed out, clutching the bag of her blood...
Immediately after, the nurse screamed: ""We need to resuscitate!
The patient is in cardiac arrest!""
Chapter 6
Chapter 6
Isabella was woken by pain.
The incandescent light overhead stung her eyes. She subconsciously tried to raise a hand to shield them, but the movement pulled at the wound on her chest, the pain so sharp it made her gasp.
""You're finally awake.""
The nurse, who was changing her dressing, let out a sigh of relief. ""We've been trying to save you for three days, you almost didn't make it... Luckily, the new artificial heart saved you.
But the damage to your body is severe. If you can't find a suitable heart for transplant within three years, I'm afraid you won't survive...""
Isabella stared at the ceiling, the light gone from her eyes.
She raised a hand to her chest. It was completely still.
The heart that once beat for Joseph was gone.
And her love for him was completely exhausted.
The nurse, worried about her, couldn't help but ask: ""Should I go get Mr. Ashford?""
Isabella shook her head: ""Don't tell him.""
The nurse was confused: ""Why not?
Isn't he your husband?""
""No.""
Isabella's voice was as faint as a wisp of smoke: ""He won't be for much longer.""
The door to the hospital room was suddenly thrown open. Joseph stood in the doorway, his brow slightly furrowed: ""What did you say?""
The nurse made a quick, awkward exit.
Joseph walked to the bedside and asked in a low voice: ""Are you angry with me because of the blood donation?""
Isabella didn't speak, nor did she look up at him.
Joseph lifted her chin, forcing Isabella to look up: ""You made a mistake and now you're taking it out on others. Why are you being so unreasonable?""
A red mark appeared on Isabella's fair chin where he gripped it. She only asked faintly: ""Is there something you need?""
Joseph released her, his tone softening slightly, ""Peter said, Mom should wake up tomorrow.""
In that moment, Isabella's dead heart beat once more!
The next day, before the sun was even up, she rushed to her mother's hospital room.
But just as she reached the door, she saw Sophia disconnecting her mother's ventilator!
Isabella's pupils contracted, and she screamed hoarsely: ""Stop!""
Sophia looked up, smiling viciously: ""Isabella, you can't stop me. Your mother's life is mine.""
With that, she shoved Isabella hard.
Isabella stumbled and fell, the surgical wound on her chest tearing in agony.
She forced herself to crawl up, protectively standing in front of her mother's bed.
""Get out!
Don't you dare touch my mom!""
Sophia was about to step forward when she caught a glimpse of a figure outside the door. She suddenly collapsed to the floor, tears instantly welling up: ""Mrs. Ashford, I already told you, Mr. Ashford sent me to borrow it. Why did you have to push me...""
What Joseph saw when he walked in was Sophia, fallen and crying. His face immediately darkened: ""Isabella! You're bullying her again!""
Isabella trembled all over: ""You sent her to take my mother's ventilator?""
Joseph's expression was calm: ""You injured Sophia's lungs. She's been using a ventilator recently. Hers suddenly broke this morning, and the new one hasn't arrived yet. I told her to come to Mom's room to borrow it for a while.""
Isabella felt as if she had been plunged into an ice cave, unable to believe her ears.
""Joseph, my mother isn't awake yet. She'll die if you unplug the ventilator.""
Her voice trembled to its limit, but Joseph was unconcerned.
""Peter said Mom is fine. It's just for a little while, she won't die.""
Isabella clenched her fists tightly, the taste of blood spreading from the tip of her tongue. ""Joseph, you can't risk my mother's life! If my mother dies, I will never forgive you!""
Joseph's thin lips tightened, and he seemed to hesitate.
Just then, Sophia suddenly clutched her chest, gasping for air: ""Mr. Ashford, I feel so awful, I can barely breathe...""
Joseph no longer hesitated, ordering in a deep voice: ""Pull the tube!""
""Don't!"" Isabella desperately grabbed his arm, pleading, ""I'm begging you, you can't...""
""Enough! Do you think you haven't been punished enough?"" Joseph cut her off sharply, his tone leaving no room for argument: ""I said your mother won't die, so she won't die.""
With that, he flung her away and had the bodyguards drag her to a corner.
Isabella knelt on the floor, watching helplessly as her mother's breathing tube was removed. She cried and begged until her voice was hoarse, but Joseph remained unmoved, leaving with Sophia in his arms without a backward glance.
Suddenly, the heart monitor let out a piercing, continuous shriek—
On the screen, Isabella's mother's heartbeat became a flat line.
Isabella frantically pressed the emergency call button, but no one responded.
She burst out of the room like a madwoman, screaming down the empty hallway: ""Is there a doctor! Please, save my mother! She's dying!""
The entire floor was deathly silent.
A desperate thought flashed through her mind: Joseph, to punish her, was deliberately preventing the doctors from saving her mother.
She turned and bolted down the stairs, missing a step and falling hard, but she ignored the pain, scrambled up, and kept running.
She pounded on doors floor after floor, running a full eight floors before she found a doctor.
But by the time the doctor arrived, Isabella's mother was no longer breathing.
Just one more day, and her mother would have woken up!
Just one more day...
Isabella stared blankly at her mother's ashen face, her entire being feeling as if her soul had been ripped out. She opened her mouth, but no sound came out.
She realized that the most extreme pain is one that you cannot cry from.
Joseph, I regret it. I regret ever loving you.
I regret it so much.",2,1764299510.0,NovelLinks,0,1.0,False
1p8kbr1,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/1p8kbr1/family_thanksgiving/,Family thanksgiving,"Hi and happy Thanksgiving. I went to my family thanksgiving this year, didn’t go last year. This year I brought some of my own food. Had some veggies that were served. No one really says anything about what I am eating, it’s siblings and cousins and their children. I was sitting afterwards with my older sister and her husband and two young adult children, talking about the health virtues of coffee and tea. I was talking about the flavonoids and other things that make them healthy. Out of nowhere my sister has to say to me that the vegan food I had eaten was processed crap. I was stunned at first, because we were not talking about vegan food or anything regarding veganism at all, just coffee and tea. I look at her and say this, and also that any vegan processed foods that I ate today are not what I normally eat and were just for thanksgiving. And I point out that the foods she brought, mac and cheese and the green beans casserole are also processed. My feelings were hurt. I didn’t say this to her, but she knows. She has always been sort of a b*%#ch, especially to me. After that, I didn’t want to be there anymore. I ordered an uber and left. I am posting here because I thought some of you could relate to spending time with non vegans during the holidays. Like, why do they feel the need to comment?",8,1764299505.0,vegan,6,1.0,False

1p8k7sb,https://www.reddit.com/r/realWorldPrepping/comments/1p8k7sb/solid_fuel_tablets/,Solid Fuel Tablets,"I bought a Cohglan emergency stove with solid fuel (hexamine or Esbit) tablets many years ago.  It was in vehicle then garage then back to vehicle may times.  I finally got bored and gave it a try.

It smelled when burning and used 2 tablets to get 12 ounces of water hot enough to make a cup of coffee.  I was not impressed.  Then I realized that stove and tablets was rather old, maybe 20 years old, really don't remember when I got it.

All the bad points, It produces noxious fumes. It can not be used inside, not even in a dire emergency could this fuel be used to heat a tent or vehicle. Leaves a sticky residue on bottom of pans. The residue washes off easily or rubbed off in sand or dirt.   Performance of stove is similar to alcohol stove, not great. Stove works well to heat something but not great for cooking.

All the good points, they last years, can't spill or leak like alcohol or white gas stoves.  If you see the tablets you know you have fuel.  Depending on stove, twigs could be used with or in place of tablets.  Cohglans stove with tablets is rather compact,

I like the stove enough I have used it several more times to make coffee and have bought more tablets.  The applications for this stove are limited but for a 8 dollar stove with fuel that can be stored years in vehicle and still work, this stove is an option.",3,1764299144.0,realWorldPrepping,0,1.0,False

1p8k5b0,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegas/comments/1p8k5b0/trip_report_10221118/,Trip Report 10/22-11/18,"Later-post! Spent a full month in Vegas and been a little hectic since I got back (and preparing to go back in 2 weeks)! Overall with tier benefits / Resort credits and comps, the trip cost me under $1500 total, not including any gambling, so sharing what I paid by working with the comp system & tier status. 
On the gambling side I had a small budget to work with for the whole month, ended up spending it, but won enough to make some pretty impressive tier credit moves. Here is the breakdown: 

1. Circa - 2 nights - cost $2
Had a regular King room booked but ended up taking a 2 Queen since it was ready when I arrived. Had a wonderfully quiet North view. Enjoyed some time around Fremont - Golden Gate happy hour event, and some time watching the live cover bands, pretty standard stuff. Ate at Saginaw's, Jackpot Coffee, and an impossible burger at Victory Burger. 

2. Fontainebleau - 4 nights - cost $148.30
Had a Platinum King room with south facing view of strip/sphere. Ate at Mother Wolf a couple times, Washing Potato, and Miami Slice. Took a stroll to Resorts World and ate at Crossroads. Was working a LOT during this stay so stayed pretty low key. 

3. Flamingo - 4 nights - cost $440
Had a Flamingo King room, which was very clean and quiet. No view, but all good since I had a lot of work to do. Ate at Pinky's, Johnny Rockets, and Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars. Went back to FB for Adam Sandler show and had dinner at Mother Wolf. 

Cons: My hot water was off for an entire day, and I'm still grossed out by them having the only outside Trash can inside the Valet pickup seating area. 

4. Park MGM - 4 nights - cost $154.51
Stayed in a Nightingale suite for the first time, it wasn't much different than a regular room with the exception of having a fridge and a lot more space. View was of Aria which is always a lovely sight, and internet worked better than normal. 
Ate at La Pizza La Pasta, and had a few random meals. Also flew to LA for a meeting for one night, so only really spent two days at the hotel. 

Cons: my room was right next to a ""mechanical"" room - even though it was an adjacent wall, the reverberation sounded like people practicing for the olympics over my head. Also possibly someone dismembering bodies. Was super annoying. 
Some of the towels smelled like vinegar and just generally unclean - Aria has this same issue so probably same laundry. This has been an ongoing issue. 

5. Resorts World - 2 nights - cost $40.50
Had a lovely strip view in Conrad, had a great run on the slots. Ate at Crossroads and Brezza. 

Cons: Room took til 4pm to be ready, yet smelled like dog. Hallway smelled lemony fresh - why can't the room smell good? Their pillows suck all the balls. They appear fluffy, but as soon as you put any pressure on them, they flatten all the way out. And they smelled like dog. 

6. Planet Hollywood - 3 nights - $216.55
Stayed in an Ultra Hip King room with view of Pool, which is closed for the season so it was super quiet.  The room was super spacious, and very clean. Got some great sleep!! Also had a great slot run one of the days. Ate at Bacchanal at Caesars again, had a tuna melt from Earl of Sandwich. 
I attended SEMA one of the days, and went to Trevor Noah show at Fontainebleau. Had a fantastic night on the slots at FB after. 
Rented a car on my last day to do some laundry (thank God for drop off service!) and run some other errands. 

7. Venetian - 3 nights - $253.57
Booked a Palazzo king room but ended up taking a Venetian Room instead due to it being ready before the others. The remodeled Venetian rooms are so nice, so no complaints. I'm in LOVE with the sofas. I had a lot of work these days also, so I spent quality time on the sofa with some Netflix, snacks, and my laptop! 
Ate at Grand Luxe a couple times, and at my fave Brera Osteria. 
Went back to FB for dinner at Mother Wolf and the Heart concert. 

8. Cosmo - 5 nights - $123.06
Had a one bedroom fountain view. Needless to say, the view was fantastic. It rained a couple days of my visit and temperature had dropped, so not too much balcony action. Had a couple of great work days in the room - I love their L shaped sofas. Also looove that Japanese soaking tub. 
Dined at Blue Ribbon, Secret Pizza, back to La Pizza La Pasta at Park MGM and Catch at Aria. Oh, and one more trip over to Planet Hollywood for that tuna melt at Earl of Sandwich. 
Went to BravoCon on the rainiest day ever 😩 but I survived with little trauma from the flooding. 

Overall it was a chill trip with some fun activities. Heading back in 2 weeks for the holidays!!!

1p8k4iz,https://i.redd.it/yd9xo13cyw3g1.jpeg,The Best Ways to Find Cheap Lots for Rent in Your Area,"The Finest Ways to Discover Low-cost Parcels for Lease in Your Vicinity\
Are you searching for an affordable parcel to lease in your vicinity? Whether you're seeking a location for your mobile home, a small dwelling, a recreational vehicle, or a camping site, the quest for an inexpensive parcel to lease can be quite challenging. Nevertheless, by employing appropriate methods and resources, you can secure an excellent deal on a parcel that suits your requirements and budget. In this article, we will examine the finest ways to discover economical parcels for lease in your vicinity.\
1. Utilize Online Rental Platforms\
One of the most convenient and efficient ways to find low-cost parcels for lease in your vicinity is to utilize online rental platforms. Websites such as Craigslist, Zillow, Realtor.com, and Rent.com have dedicated sections for land and parcels that are available for lease. You can narrow down your search by specifying the location, price range, and type of parcel you're seeking.\
In addition to general rental platforms, there are also specialized websites and apps that cater specifically to the mobile home and RV community. Websites like MHVillage and RV Park Store allow you to search for parcels and parks that are tailored to your specific housing needs. These platforms often provide detailed listings with photos, descriptions, and contact information, making it easy to find and compare budget-friendly parcels for lease in your vicinity.\
2. Contact Local Real Estate Agents\
Another valuable resource for discovering economical parcels for lease in your vicinity is through local real estate agents. Real estate agents often have access to listings that are not publicly available, including potential rental opportunities for parcels and land. By reaching out to real estate agents in your vicinity and explaining your specific rental needs and budget, you may uncover hidden gems that are not advertised through traditional channels.\
Real estate agents can also provide valuable insights and guidance when it comes to navigating the rental market for parcels. They can help you comprehend local zoning laws, assist with negotiations, and ensure that you are getting the best deal possible.\
3. Explore Community Boards and Classifieds\
Community boards, local newspapers, and online classifieds can be great resources for discovering economical parcels for lease in your vicinity. Many property owners and individuals looking to lease out their land will advertise through these channels, as they are cost-effective and reach a local audience. Keep an eye out for postings in community centers, grocery stores, coffee shops, and online forums that cater to your specific housing needs.\
By regularly checking community boards and classifieds, you may come across hidden gems that are not listed on mainstream rental platforms. This can give you a competitive edge in discovering an economical parcel for lease before it becomes widely publicized.\
4. Network within the Mobile Home and RV Community\
Networking within the mobile home and RV community can be an effective way to discover economical parcels for lease in your vicinity. By connecting with other individuals who are residing in mobile homes or RVs, you can gain valuable insights and leads on potential rental opportunities. These connections can be made through social media groups, online forums, and local meetups that cater to mobile home and RV enthusiasts.\
Additionally, reaching out to mobile home parks, RV parks, and small dwelling communities in your vicinity can open doors to rental opportunities. These communities often have a network of residents who may know of available parcels or be able to provide recommendations for affordable rental options in the area.\
5. Consider Leasing Privately-Owned Land\
In addition to traditional rental options, consider exploring the possibility of leasing privately-owned land. Many property owners have extra land that they are willing to lease out for a variety of purposes, including housing mobile homes, RVs, and small dwellings. By directly approaching property owners with a rental proposal, you can negotiate terms that may be more flexible and affordable than leasing through a commercial entity.\
When pursuing privately-owned land for lease, it's important to have a clear understanding of local zoning regulations, utilities, and any restrictions that may apply. You'll also want to ensure that you have a formal rental agreement in place to protect both parties involved.\
6. Attend Local Real Estate and Housing Events\
Real estate and housing events, such as open houses, property auctions, and housing fairs, can be valuable opportunities to uncover economical parcels for lease in your vicinity. These events provide an insider's look at available properties and rental opportunities, and they allow you to connect with property owners, real estate agents, and housing professionals in person.\
By attending these events, you can gain a better understanding of the local housing market, make valuable connections, and potentially find rental opportunities that are not widely advertised. Additionally, participating in real estate and housing events can give you a competitive edge in securing economical parcels for lease before they are widely publicized.\
7. Be Proactive and Persistent in Your Search\
Finally, when searching for economical parcels for lease in your vicinity, it's important to be proactive and persistent in your efforts. The rental market for parcels can be competitive, especially in high-demand areas, so staying active in your search is essential. Regularly check online rental platforms, community boards, and classifieds, and be proactive in reaching out to real estate agents, property owners, and local housing communities.\
Additionally, be open to exploring different neighborhoods and areas within your vicinity to find affordable rental options. By casting a wider net and being persistent in your search, you increase your chances of finding an economical parcel for lease that suits your needs and budget.\
In conclusion, discovering economical parcels for lease in your vicinity requires thorough research, strategic networking, and proactive efforts. By utilizing online rental platforms, contacting local real estate agents, exploring community boards and classifieds, networking within the mobile home and RV community, considering privately-owned land, attending local real estate and housing events, and maintaining a proactive and persistent approach, you can uncover great deals on parcels that meet your budget and housing needs. With these strategies in mind, you can successfully secure an economical parcel for lease in your vicinity and embark on your desired housing journey.\

No matter how hard I try, I can’t seem to shake this thought. I imagine the smell being really strong, like a mix of rotten eggs and sewer gas. Maybe even with a hint of sulfur. I shake my head again, disgusted at myself for this random thought. Why am I even thinking this?

My dad talks to me like I’m this crazy selfish monster that’s super self absorbed. Like I work in the medical field in an administrative role so I know a lot of terminology but I have never once misrepresented myself as being a nurse or doctor or anything. I do not do or say anything outside of what I’m capable of doing. He told me not to act like I’m better than a family members oncology team completely unprompted. We had just been discussing our plans to get coffee in the morning when he said all this to me. He thinks so lowly of me and I have not done anything to him. Multiple family members have noticed his treatment of me and agree that I don’t deserve it. 

My grandma snaps at me and is ordering me around but I’m not a child. She should be asking me. 

At Thanksgiving, I was excluded from everything. All my cousins were playing games together and they didn’t invite me over with them to even just be part of the merriment. They didn’t even talk to me period while there. These people haven’t seen me in 6 years. They tell me how much they miss me and then I show up and I ask why I even bothered to come. It took a lot of planning, moving my work schedule, figuring things out in my social life, and financial planning to show up. I was so excited to come and see everyone again. 

I even lost a SIGNIFICANT amount of weight safely and on purpose. No one noticed. Not one person in my family noticed.

I am the youngest of six kids, and for as long as I can remember, that meant being an afterthought. My older siblings were the “promising ones” who got the attention, the extra tutoring, the rides to activities, and later the help with college and weddings. By the time it was my turn, my parents were tired in every sense of the word. They did not say it outright at first, but the message was clear: there was nothing left for me, financially or emotionally. When I started talking about wanting to do my own thing in tech instead of a “respectable” degree, it just confirmed for them that I was the difficult one. The real break happened when I was 19. I turned down the one local college they were willing to help with because I wanted to keep working on an app idea I had been building in the evenings after my shift. My parents called me ungrateful and reckless, and one of my brothers told me that if I walked out, I should not bother coming back when it “inevitably failed.” I left anyway. There were no calls checking if I made it to the tiny room I rented, no surprise visits, no “we miss you.” The few times I did reach out, it felt like I was talking to strangers who were only interested in confirming that I was still struggling, as if that justified their decision. It took years of ugly, exhausting work. I learned to code better by watching free videos and reading documentation after shifts. I worked jobs I hated to keep the lights on. I failed with more ideas than I care to admit. Then the app that was supposed to be a small side project suddenly took off. There was a surreal period where numbers on a screen turned into the kind of money I used to think only existed for other people. A company reached out, talks happened, and suddenly my app was acquired and I was sitting in a lawyer’s office staring at a number that did not feel real. I remember walking home that night thinking that there was no one in my family I could call who would be happy for me without making it about themselves. It did not take long for them to find out. Extended family talks, and social media does the rest. The first message was from my mother, a short text about how she had been “thinking of me lately” and wanted to reconnect. Then the floodgates opened: siblings adding me, cousins reaching out, my father sending a long email about wanting to “heal old wounds.” At first, I tried to be cautious but not cruel. I met my parents for coffee. They were warm, overly so, complimenting everything from my clothes to my “resilience.” By the second meeting, the conversation turned. They asked about how much I made, whether I had “plans” to help the family, and hinted that my success was the result of the “values they instilled” in me. After that, the requests started. One sister sent a long message about struggling with her mortgage and how “a little help” from me could give her kids stability. A brother framed it as an “investment opportunity” in his failing business, but the tone made it clear that he saw it as something I owed him for “always being hard” on me to “motivate” me. When I said no, gently at first, the mask slipped. I was called selfish, arrogant, and accused of forgetting “where I came from.” The narrative shifted from “we are proud of you” to “you would not be here without us.” It was strange to watch them rewrite the past in real time, turning neglect into some kind of tough-love origin story they deserved to be paid for. The lawsuit felt unreal, even when I was holding the documents. They claimed that they had made “substantial familial and financial investments” in my development and that I had a “moral and implied contractual duty” to support them now. Reading it was like looking at a parallel universe where my childhood had been a carefully curated boot camp for success instead of a series of rooms I was quietly ignored in. My lawyer explained that there was no real basis for what they were trying to do, at least where we live, but that did not make it hurt less. In that moment, any lingering fantasy that they might one day apologize or try to understand me evaporated. They were willing to drag me into court just to see if there was a chance they could force money out of me. The case was dismissed. It did not go far, and legally it was straightforward, but emotionally it was draining. Word spread through the family grapevine, and suddenly I was being painted as the ungrateful child who “made it and abandoned everyone,” conveniently skipping the part where they abandoned me first. These days, I have most of them blocked. A few cousins who reached out privately to say they thought the whole thing was wrong are the only people I still talk to. Sometimes, late at night, it still hits that my success did not give me the thing I secretly wanted most: a family that is happy for me without seeing dollar signs. People love the idea of the “self-made” youngest kid who proves everyone wrong, but living it does not feel like a victory lap. It feels like standing on an island you built yourself and realizing that the people on the shore only start waving when they think there is treasure behind you.There is a quiet grief in knowing that if I had stayed small and struggling, they would have been content to ignore me forever, but the moment I became useful, they tried to own a piece of me, even through a courtroom. The money changed my life, but it also made it impossible to pretend that what they did to me was anything other than conditional love with a price tag.",1,1764298466.0,aistory,0,1.0,False

\[Entry 1 - August 3rd\]

My name is Claude. My parents are on a three-week cruise, a reward for decades of work and worry. They left me, the dependable son, in charge of the house and of Leo.

Leo is my older brother. Three years ago, a rupture in his brainstem—a cavernous angioma, a term my mother uses like a shield—left him in a persistent vegetative state. His mind is a distant lighthouse. The only signal it sends, the only proof that someone is still manning the light, is the word ""hello.""

My days have a rhythm, a liturgy of care that keeps the silence of this house at bay.

**7:00 AM:** The Krups coffee maker gurgles to life, brewing yesterday's grounds into something that tastes of bitterness and thin, metallic hope. I drink it black, standing at the kitchen sink. The coffee is stale by noon, but I keep the pot going, a constant, acrid presence.

**7:30 AM:** I climb the stairs. The fourth step from the top groans a specific, familiar note—a G-flat of worn pine and settling nails. I enter Leo's room. It smells of antiseptic wipes and the faint, cloying sweetness of the Ensure formula. The Respironics V60 ventilator hisses its steady, mechanical breath. Its LED display is a soft, eternal green. My first task is to check its settings: Tidal Volume 450ml, Rate 12, FiO2 21%. The numbers are a prayer for stability.

""Good morning, Leo,"" I say, my voice rough with sleep.

His eyes, the same sea-glass green as mine, are open and fixed on the ceiling. His mouth, slack around the ventilator tube, works for a moment. A soft, wet sound. Then the word, clear and placid.

""Hello.""

It's our ritual. For years, it's been a comfort. A tiny, consistent flare from the silent continent of his mind. I perform the rest of my duties with a nurse's detachment: suction his airway, check his diaper, wipe his body with a damp cloth. His skin is cool and waxy. I log everything in the blue binder on the nightstand: \*8:05 AM - Oral care completed. Vitals stable.\*

The days are long and quiet. I exist in the space between the hiss of the ventilator and the creak of the floorboards. Leo's ""hello"" is the punctuation mark of my day.

\[Entry 2 - August 7th\]

The first oddity was a sound. It was late, maybe 11 PM. I was in my room, directly below Leo's, reading. A *thump* came from above. Not loud, but solid. Dense. Like a heavy book falling on its face.

I listened, my breath held. The house settled. The refrigerator kicked on.

I crept upstairs. The fourth step groaned its usual complaint. Leo's door was ajar. The nightlight cast a soft glow. He was in his bed, perfectly still. Nothing was out of place.

""Leo?"" I whispered.

His eyes were closed.

""Hello,"" he murmured, the word soft and blurred by slumber.

I stood there for a long time. I checked the windows. Locked. I stood in the center of the room and stared at the ceiling, as if I could see the source of the sound through the plaster. It was probably a muscle spasm. A book falling in a neighbor's house. My imagination, stretched thin by the quiet.

\[Entry 3 - August 10th\]

The correspondence of sounds began two days ago. I’m trying to be logical about it.

I was pacing in my room, a restless animal. Three steps from the bed to the door, a pivot, three steps back. The floorboard by my desk groaned under my weight.

*Creak.*

A moment later, a similar sound came from directly above. From Leo's room.

I froze. Our houses are old. Wood expands and contracts. It was a coincidence. I took a hesitant step towards the window. The floorboard there was silent.

*Creak.*

From above. Another groan, this one mirroring the timing of my step, if not the location.

My heart thudded once, hard. This was… peculiar. I lifted my hand and, feeling foolish, rapped my knuckles twice against the wooden bedpost. *Tap. Tap.*

A beat of silence. Then, from upstairs, two taps. *Tap. Tap.* The same tempo.

A coincidence of acoustics? The house’s skeleton talking to itself? I stood perfectly still, and the house remained still with me. The only constant was the low hum of the V60. I decided to note it in the log, for my own sanity. \*11:14 PM - Audible settling noises from floor joists. Synchronous?\*

\[Entry 4 - August 12th\]

The ""hello"" is changing. I think I'm just tired. The lack of sleep is getting to me.

It's started to feel less like a greeting and more like a… placeholder. I'll walk into his room, and his eyes will seem to track me for a fraction of a second too long before he says it. ""Hello."" I was suctioning his throat this afternoon, a necessary, violent intimacy, and he said it around the plastic catheter, a wet, guttural sound. ""Hhhhellllo."" The sound clung to the inside of my skull.

My routine is fraying. I forgot to log his 2:00 PM meds yesterday. This morning, I found the coffee pot had burned dry, filling the house with the smell of scorched metal and failure.

\[Entry 5 - August 14th\]

The chattering started today.

I was changing his diaper. The room smelled of antiseptic wipes and Ensure. I had just rolled him onto his side when I heard it. A small, dry sound.

*Click. Click.*

I looked at his face. His jaw was trembling, the muscles twitching. His teeth were chattering.

""Leo? Are you cold?"" The question was automatic, pointless.

The chattering stopped. His jaw went slack.

""Hello,"" he said, perfectly calm.

\[Entry 6 - August 16th\]

It happened again last night. Louder. I was in the kitchen, the bread of my sandwich tasteless in my mouth. *Click-click-click-click.* A frantic rhythm from his room. I ran upstairs. He was lying there, peaceful, but his teeth were clattering like dice in a cup. It lasted ten seconds, then stopped.

""Hello,"" he said.

I called the long-term care provider. I tried to explain.

""Mr. Franklin, your brother's condition is stable. The V60 pings us for any physiological anomaly. We see no alerts.""

""But the sounds—the chattering—""

""Patients in a persistent vegetative state can exhibit myoclonic jerks. It can be distressing for family. Are you getting respite care?""

They are not coming. The system sees only green lights.

\[Entry 7 - August 18th\]

The third time, it… escalated.

It was the middle of the night. The sound wasn't just chattering; it was a grinding, a high-pitched squeal of enamel on enamel. I stood frozen at his door. The sound sped up, a frantic, mechanical rhythm. *Clickclickclick-grind-CLICKCLICK—*

It ended with a wet, sickening *crack*.

Silence.

A silence so deep it swallowed the world. The ventilator had stopped hissing.

I didn't sleep. At dawn, I went in. Leo looked the same. His jaw was not misaligned. There was no blood. But his ""Hello” was different now, slurred, the ‘H’ a soft, breathy exhalation. “’Ello.”

The ventilator was off. I checked the power. The plug was seated firmly in the outlet. The LED display was dark. I cycled the power. Nothing. A cold dread poured into me. This was a machine failure. A real, tangible problem. I ran to the basement, to my father's heavy, fireproof SentrySafe where he keeps all the manuals, warranties, and house plans. I fumbled with the combination. I needed the schematic for the V60, the emergency contact for the medical supply company, anything.

I found the house plans first, a thick roll of blueprints. I spread them on the dusty floor, my hands shaking. My eyes scanned the electrical layouts, looking for a dedicated circuit. And that’s when I saw it. The renovation. My room downstairs, and Leo’s room upstairs… they were perfect mirror images. The same dimensions, the same layout. The closet in my room was directly below the closet in his. The floorboard that creaked by my desk was directly below the one that creaked by his.

We were living in perfect vertical alignment.

Then, tucked into the plans, I found the patient file from the care company. A printout of the medication logs. My eyes, frantic, scanned the pages. And I saw it. A small, initialed signature for the nightly Clonazepam. ""C. Franklin."" My signature. But next to it, in a supplemental digital log, the same signature, ""C. Franklin,"" was listed for Leo’s administered dose. I am Claude. He is Leo. The names are different.

I called the care company, my voice a frayed wire. ""There's a mistake in the logs. The signatures are merged.""

The woman was patient. ""Oh, that. It’s a system-wide update for cost-efficiency. For siblings at the same address, the software can designate a 'Primary' and a 'Mirror' patient to streamline automated reporting. The Mirror’s data syncs with the Primary’s. It reduces administrative duplicate entries.""

A mundane, administrative subversion. A software update to save money. Leo isn’t just my brother. To the system, he is my mirror.

\[Final Entry - August 21st\]

The ventilator has been dead for three days. The silence it left behind isn’t empty; it’s a thick, fluid thing that fills the house, pressing against my eardrums until they ache. I am writing this from the kitchen table. My hands are shaking so badly the letters look like they’re vibrating off the page. The pot of stale coffee on the warmer has evaporated into a black, tarry sludge that smells like a burnt-out motor and something else, something sweetly organic, like rot.

I haven’t slept. The house doesn’t feel quiet anymore. It feels like it’s listening.

An hour ago, a new sound started from above.

A soft, dragging sound. A long, slow scrape of weight across the upstairs hallway floorboards. Then a pause, long enough for me to hope it had stopped. Then another drag. It wasn’t the sound of someone walking. It was the sound of something pulling itself, one painful heave at a time. It’s slow. Deliberate. It’s not mimicking my shuffle anymore. It’s learning to move on its own.

I was up there six hours ago. I had to be. The silence was worse than the sounds. I crept up, each step a lifetime, the fourth step groaning its familiar, traitorous note. I pushed Leo’s door open.

The room was freezing. The air was stale and motionless. Leo was on the floor.

He was halfway between the bed and the door, his body a tangled heap of pale limbs and the twisted hospital gown. His head was lolled to the side, his eyes wide open and fixed on the doorway. On me. They weren’t the sea-glass green I know. They were black, depthless pools, like wells that went down forever.

And then he moved.

His head tilted, a jerky, marionette motion, the vertebrae in his neck cracking like a string of firecrackers. It was the first voluntary, targeted movement I have seen him make in years. My breath seized in my throat. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t scream.

His jaw, the one that had chattered and cracked, unhinged. It didn’t just drop open; it sagged downwards, dislocating with a wet, tearing pop, stretching his face into a wide, dark O that was all wrong. From the depths of that black hole, past the ruin of tissue and bone, a sound bubbled up. It wasn’t slurred. It was clear and hollow, a voice from a deep well, and it was his, and in that moment of sheer, mind-shattering terror, I swear it was mine.

""Hello.""

I stumbled back from his doorway, my legs giving way, and scrambled down the stairs on my hands and knees, the splinters of the old wood digging into my palms. I haven’t been up since.

I didn’t hide. I didn’t run. I called the care company again, my voice a hysterical wire. ""He's out of bed! The ventilator is off and he's on the floor! He's moving!""

The triage nurse was a recorded message of calm. ""Mr. Franklin, without a physiological alert from the V60, we cannot dispatch an emergency team. Myoclonic jerks can be violent. He may have fallen. You should reposition him.""

""He spoke! He looked at me!""

""Reflexive vocalization is not uncommon. Please consult the pamphlet we provided on caregiver stress.""

I slammed the phone down. My next thought was the police. But what would I say? *My vegetative brother is crawling around his room?* They’d commit me. They’d take Leo away, and my parents would never forgive me. I failed to protect him once, by not being there the day he fell. I couldn't fail again. I had to fix this. I had to wait it out. He would exhaust himself. He would stop. This was my responsibility.

So I stayed in the kitchen. It was the strategic center of the house. The back door was ten feet away. The phone was on the wall. I had a clear line of sight to the staircase. I was not hiding; I was standing my ground. I was guarding him from whatever this was, and guarding the world from him.

The dragging continued from above. For an hour, it traced a path from his room to the top of the stairs. A slow, deliberate mapping of territory. And now it has stopped.

A new sound has begun.

A wet, rhythmic slap. A hand, I think, palm flat and slick, smacking down on the top wooden step to find purchase. A moment of strained silence. Then the thick, gritty drag of a dead weight following after it.

*Slap.* (a pause, the sound of tendons straining)  
*Drrrrrrrrag.* (the sound of denim and flesh over rough-hewn wood)

*SLAP.* (closer now, on the second step)  
*DRRRRRRAG.* (longer, heavier, a bone within the mass cracking softly under the strain)

My resolve is gone. The strategic center is a trap. I am frozen here, the professional caretaker utterly dismantled, leaving only a terrified child. The coffee pot on the counter has started to vibrate with the impact of each movement. A fine tremor runs through the table under my elbows.

*SLAP.* (The third step. It’s so close.)  
*DRRR—* The drag is interrupted by a sickening, wet snap. A sound that speaks of things tearing that should never be torn.

The fourth step from the top just creaked.

The sound was exactly the same as it’s always been. A G-flat of worn pine and settling nails. A homely, familiar sound that now feels like the tolling of a bell.

It’s on the landing.

My brother is coming down.

My phone has no service. The screen shows a stark, empty triangle where the bars should be. I tried to call 911 and the call failed. The landline is dead, too—a hollow, plastic dial tone that feels like a mockery. Maybe the storm last night took out a line. Or maybe it’s something else. The router’s lights are all dark. But my laptop, with its dying battery, still has a draft of this post open. This text box is the only thing in the world that still feels connected to anything. It’s my flare gun into the void. If I stop typing, the silence will eat me.

*Slap. Drag.*  
It’s on the stairs now. The fifth step? The sixth? I can’t remember how many there are. I’ve lived here my whole life and I can’t remember how many steps are on my own staircase. I think it’s thirteen. But that can’t be right, that’s too many, isn’t it?

The coffee pot. I just looked at it. The power is out, but it’s still warm. How is it still warm? I unplugged it hours ago. I think I did. Did I?

I have to be clear. I have to make you understand. He’s coming down and I can’t remember if I fed him today. Did I log his meds? The binder is upstairs. I can’t go up there. The V60 is dead but it’s blinking. I saw it blinking from the hallway. Green. Green. Green. Like a heartbeat.

*Slap. Drag.*  
Closer.

He said “Hello” and his jaw was broken. But when I ran, I looked back and he was smiling. I think he was smiling. His mouth was a straight line. No, it was a curve. A wide, dark O. I can’t remember. I can’t remember his face before the accident anymore. I try to picture him laughing and all I see is that dark O.

The dragging has stopped. Why has it stopped?

It’s on the landing. The landing is only ten feet from this kitchen. There is no door between us.

I can hear a new sound. A wet, clicking sound. Like a tongue against the roof of a mouth. Or like… like knuckles cracking.

He’s not dragging anymore.

He’s standing up.

I can hear the weight shifting. The floorboards in the hall are groaning under a full, standing weight. That’s not possible. His muscles have atrophied. He hasn’t stood in three years. The doctors said he would never…

One footstep. Then another. Slow, shuffling, but firm. Balanced.

He’s walking.

The fourth step creaked. But he’s already past the steps. He’s in the hall. So why did I hear it again?

I have to post this. The battery is at 3%. I have to let someone know. My name is Claude Franklin. My brother Leo was in a vegetative state. I think I might have forgotten to give him his Clonazepam last night. Or was it the night before? The log is wrong. The dates are all wrong in the binder. I saw it this morning. It says today is August 10th. But that’s the day the mimicry started. Isn't it?

The footsteps have stopped.

He’s just on the other side of the kitchen doorway. I can see a shadow stretching across the linoleum of the hall. It’s long and thin. It doesn’t look like Leo.

The shadow’s head is turning towards me.

I can’t look up. I can’t.

The laptop fan is whirring, it’s so hot. It’s the only sound.

“Hello,” he says. His voice is right here. In the room with me. It doesn’t sound hollow anymore. It sounds like mine.

The battery is at 1%.

I picked up old hobbies I’d left collecting dust, went on solo coffee dates, met new people online who eventually became friends, and even started reading again — mostly to sort through the million feelings I pretend I don’t have. It’s been grounding. Healing. A little dramatic at times (blame the OPM I listen to). But freeing.

And somewhere in between all that self-discovery, I realized something I didn’t want to admit out loud:

Not in a frantic, “OMG I need a partner” type of way. More like… I have this steady, quiet love in me — the kind meant to be shared in small, everyday moments — and it would be nice if someone wanted to receive it.

Not all at once. Just gradually. Gently. With intention.

*\*Here comes the pitch\**

I want to start with a friendship. The kind where conversations stretch past midnight *because neither of us wants to end it yet.* The kind where we hype each other up about our passions — kahit geeky, weird, or wildly niche.

I’m not looking for instant magic. I’m looking for that slow-burn “let’s see where this goes” energy. Someone who’s willing to go on dates, talk deeply, laugh stupidly, and maybe, if life is kind, build something real.

What I tend to vibe with:

* same age range give or take a few years
* someone curious about the world, politics, people, music, anything
* may at least *one* geeky obsession
* articulate (or at least thoughtful)
* emotionally aware
* and, fine, cute & tall. I’m not gonna lie HAHAHA
* from Manila

About me:

* 5'1
* pretty chill-looking, decent enough, and very comfortable in my own skin
* a science girlie
* love good music
* I fall in love with movies, songs, ideas
* always up for coffee, long drives, or weekend and study dates
* usually busy but I give effort where effort is appreciated

If you’ve read this far, hello. I like you already or at least your attention span.

Start with something simple: your idea first date, the most Manila thing about you, or the weirdest thought you had in traffic today.

Happy Thanksgiving/Genocide Awareness Day

I’m posting because Reddit has notified me several times in the past week or so about this subreddit. My intent was to let it be and post on r/Univercity. I’ve cut down on my screen time & participation (or have tried to!) recently, but after the notifications and gleaning some things about mods/subreddits I decided to post.

I’m posting just so Reddit sees this subreddit as active; I don’t want it to be deleted and I’m not sure if inactivity would trigger such an event.

I’d rather just have an option to archive what I’ve written and some of what others have; some of your posts and comments were really great and I appreciate the participation!

That said, I do have some concerns with this seeming MK Ultra-esque theatre I have endured for some time which is partly why I stopped participation; for us both. I was also concerned with this space becoming ooer-adjacent, if that’s such a thing.

The story I’ve written in this subreddit are part thoughts, part experience, and part (I suppose one could say) artistic expression. Sometimes I would have a couplah and post and embarrass myself greatly, but if you blame me for that, I don’t.

Reviewing some of your posts and comments brought me thoughts and chuckles today, so I am thankful for you.

Considering time, this subreddit is but a sandcastle, but over the year of building it and then meeting you, it’s cast a pleasant breeze upon this beach we share.

I apologize for not posting more, but there it is. I don’t know if the proper thing to do would be to cast this castle in epoxy or just let the tide do its thing.

Regardless, thank you.

For this year’s mid-Autumn harvest feast my roommate, dog and I had garlic chicken and rice with roasted brussel sprouts, and quite a few cups of coffee (well, my pup had plain rice with chicken; her belly has been a little upset lately, but she is doing good!). Other than that I’ve been catching up on podcasts. Did you get up to anything/have a good holiday?

Hey there peoples! Anybody else not doing anything today? Or is it just me? Sitting here on a heating pad, somehow threw my back out at work. Anyone do anything fun this weekend? Anyone doing anything for the holiday? Any traveling? 

Who’s sick of starting chats, and then getting ghosted? My real question is, why is it so hard to make friendships that actually last? It seems like most interactions are just split moment, never more than an hour or two. 

Anyways, I’m looking to chat, hang out, chill, complain about the day, share stories, and just bond. 

Little about me, I’m a coffee addict, dog lover, outdoors lover, game enjoyer. I’m down to share doggos pics, play games, or just shoot the shit.

1p8jtp6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p8jtp6,Happy Thanksgiving!,"Aubert “Lauren” Chardonnay 2020 & Quilceda Creek Cabernet 2006 with smoked-turkey Thanksgiving

Thanksgiving line-up this year was a little ridiculous, so I figured I’d share how these two bottles actually did with the food:

Food:
Smoked turkey, BBQ pork ribs, herby sourdough stuffing, truffle mashed potatoes, chanterelle gravy, pesto green beans, shaved Brussels with bacon + balsamic, brown-butter sweet potatoes with pecan-sage streusel, cranberry sauce, pumpkin pie.

Wines:
	•	2020 Aubert “Lauren” Chardonnay
	•	2006 Quilceda Creek Cabernet Sauvignon

⸻

2020 Aubert “Lauren” Chardonnay

Opened: 1 hour before serving, no hard decant, just biggish stems.
ABV/Style: Full-bodied, modern CA Chardonnay, but not a caricature.

Appearance: Medium gold, good viscosity, nothing oxidative.

Nose:
Meyer lemon curd, ripe yellow peach, baked apple, and a clear buttered-brioche note. Behind that: vanilla bean, toasted hazelnut, a bit of flinty/matchstick reduction and some white flowers. Classic Aubert richness but with a little tension.

Palate:
Full and creamy but not flabby. Lemon oil, grilled stone fruit, roasted pear up front. Mid-palate brings brown butter, almond cream, and a faint truffley/savory note. Oak is present but polished, and the acidity is just high enough to keep the wine from feeling heavy with food.

Structure:
	•	Acidity: medium+ for the style
	•	Body: full
	•	Oak: pronounced but integrated
	•	Finish: long, citrus + toasted nut + saline

Food pairing:
	•	Baked clams / grilled octopus: Saline + citrus + subtle reduction worked really well with the brine and char. Not Burgundian, obviously, but the mineral/saline line kept it from turning into butter on butter.
	•	Truffle stuffing & herb mashed potatoes: This is where it shined. The brown-butter/oak profile locked right into the truffle and herbs; felt like adding an extra sauce layer.
	•	Pesto green beans / Brussels with bacon: Acidity stood up to the fat, and the herbal top notes didn’t clash with pesto. Bacon + oak smoke were pretty friendly together.
	•	Sweet potatoes / cranberry: Just on the edge of what it can handle; a bit more sweetness and it would’ve gone bitter, but the baked-apple and stone-fruit character kept it workable.

Overall:
If you like serious CA Chard that still has some line and energy under the richness, this is a great Thanksgiving white. Not subtle, but precise enough to survive a very busy plate.

⸻

2006 Quilceda Creek Cabernet Sauvignon

Opened: 2.5–3 hour decant. Sediment present but not crazy.
Style: Mature, high-end WA Cab that’s left its primary-fruit gym phase and moved into the leather-armchair era.

Appearance: Deep ruby with a slight brick rim. Clear, no issues.

Nose:
Cassis, black cherry, baked blackberry. Lots of cedar, cigar box, graphite, and dark chocolate. With air, it throws roasted coffee, dried herbs (sage/thyme lane), and a little smoked-meat note that made a lot of sense with the turkey and ribs.

Palate:
Still concentrated but the tannins have really resolved. Dark fruit, cassis and black cherry up front, then mocha, tobacco leaf, and a savory, almost bouillon edge. Oak is still there but way better integrated than in youth; more cedar than vanilla.

Structure:
	•	Acidity: medium
	•	Tannins: medium+, very fine-grained
	•	Body: full
	•	Alcohol: feels in check
	•	Finish: long, cassis + cocoa + cedar

Food pairing:
	•	Smoked turkey & BBQ ribs: Absolute sweet spot. The smoky oak + tertiary “roast” notes synced right up with the smoke ring and char. Tannins cleaned up the fat, especially on the ribs.
	•	Stuffing, truffled mash, biscuits & chanterelle gravy: Classic Cab vs. rich sides dynamic; felt like a steakhouse pairing even though the protein was turkey.
	•	Brussels with bacon & balsamic: Dark fruit + that little aged, almost balsamic nuance in the wine made this combo way better than it sounds on paper.
	•	Pumpkin pie: Not a match. Fine as a post-dessert sipper, though—the cocoa, dried fruit, and spice all worked once the sugar was out of the way.

Overall:
Firmly in its tertiary phase but still has enough fruit to feel complete. If you’re into old-school Napa/Bdx vibes with WA density, this is in a really nice window right now, especially with smoked meats.

⸻

If anyone’s done sparkling or lighter reds (Gamay, Trousseau, etc.) with heavy BBQ-Thanksgiving mashups like this, I’m curious how they held up next to the smoke + sweet sides.",1,1764297912.0,wine,1,1.0,False
1p8jt10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1p8jt10/am_i_allowed_to_feel_this_way/,Am I allowed to feel this way.,So I have a bf where he use to get us food always but recently stoped paying because he’s low on money. I believe this is fine so usually now I pay which I don’t mind paying. I don’t believe I’m a materialistic kind of girl but from that time he has gotten around 500 bucks where I he’s only paid now maybe a little under 5 times. Yet he’s bought himself some pretty useless things in my Opinion for example a 40 dollar towel. I’m also the type of person where I believe if we’re both going out to eat it befits both. So where he’s only gotten me maybe 5 gifts we have gone to eat more. Because I feel that a gift only benefits me vise versa. So I feel now it’s even hard for him to buy me a coffee which is fine sometimes expect when I see him buy things he Doenst need. The only times he’ll even offer to pay is when he wnats something and I tend to not go over a certain amount because I know he wants to save. My only thing is I help out my family he Doenst. We have different responsibilities so money for me is money for everyone in my family. Now when it comes to gifts I feel like he also Doenst try no more. I don’t need them to be money but something made could be a very nice gesture that he just Doenst do. Today was my last star almost because I wanted a coffee and had told him that I’ve spent around 50 dollars today so he offered to pay I made him promise me he would and he did. As we’re getting in the car because it’s thanksgiving the coffee place I wanted to go to was closed so we went to Starbucks. I ended up paying for my own drink and he wanted a cookie when in the beginning he didn’t want anything. While I didn’t mind paying it just rubbed me the wrong way that’s he promised and didn’t really fulfill his promise. So idk if im wrong and maybe im expecting to much or am i being spoiled. I truly don’t know and want to know if im in the wrong. ,0,1764297850.0,Advice,0,0.33,False

For six years, Isabella Garcia loved her husband, Joseph Ashford. But out of the blue, he was struck by a strange illness—and the cure? He had to sleep with another woman ninety-nine times.
The Ashford family has a century-old family creed: the head of the family must not marry a woman of humble birth.
But Joseph defied tradition. He burned the ancestral tablets to marry Isabella, a pearl diver, adding her to the family tree overnight and rushing into their wedding the very next day.
For five years, he spoiled her, making her the most envied woman in Coastal Harbor.
But in the sixth year, Joseph was struck by a strange illness and fell into a coma.
A mysterious master claimed it was an ancestral punishment. The only way to lift it was through a ritual marriage—where Joseph had to sleep with a ritual bride, Sophia Miller, ninety-nine times or fall into a coma again.
From then on, Joseph slept with Sophia every night, telling Isabella to wait.
Isabella could only kneel and pray for him, listening tearfully as he was intimate with another woman.
After seven days of kneeling, she returned home with a protective charm. Just as she was about to open the door, she overheard a conversation between Joseph and his friends.
\*\*\*\*\*
""Joseph, you're a genius. Faking an illness and making up a ritual marriage just to openly bring your little lover home to fool around.""
""Only someone from a humble background like Isabella would believe it. Everyone in Coastal Harbor know that our Joseph fears nothing, not even burning the ancestral memorial tablets? How could he possibly believe in some master and a ritual marriage?""
The blood in Isabella's body seemed to reverse its flow.
So Joseph wasn't sick at all; this was all his scheme!
The protective charm clutched tightly in her hand suddenly felt scorching hot, as if it would burn right through her palm.
His friend couldn't help but ask curiously: ""Joseph, you've slept with Sophia 90 times, right? Just 9 more times and the ritual marriage will be over. What are you planning to do then...""
Joseph leaned back on the sofa, his black shirt unbuttoned by two, his long legs crossed.
He took a light sip of his drink and curled his lip nonchalantly: ""When it's over, I'll just keep her on the side.""
Standing outside the door, Isabella felt a chill that pierced her to the bone.
But his friends just laughed louder: ""We told you—men like us all have someone on the side. Don't be so naive.
You've been faithful to Isabella for five years, you've done right by her.""
""A woman like Sophia, who looks innocent but has a wild side and no inhibitions in bed, is such a turn-on for men.""
""By the way, Joseph, isn't she much more fun than Isabella?""
The glass slammed heavily on the table, and Joseph's drunken eyes suddenly turned sharp.
""No one can compare to Isabella. She will always be the one I love the most.""
Everyone was stunned.
After a long moment, a friend couldn't help but speak up, asking a question Isabella also desperately wanted to know: ""Joseph, if you love her, how could you bear to make her suffer by faking an illness?
I heard the Ashford family has given her a hard time these past three months, and Madam Ashford almost subjected her to family disciplinary punishment...""
The air was silent for a few seconds.
Then, Joseph's deep voice came through—
""The Ashford family is a clan with a hundred years of prestige. To enter my family, even the daughter from an old money family must undergo a test to prove her loyalty.
Back then, I made an exception and didn't make Isabella go through this formality, and the family has always had objections.""
""Now, I'm using this ritual marriage affair to make up for it.""
She doesn't even fight or make a scene when I sleep with someone else, and even sincerely prays for me.”
“That shows she's obedient and submissive enough, worthy of being part of the Ashford family.”
He let out a soft chuckle, his voice laced with a self-righteous tenderness: “As for the suffering she's endured for me, I'll make it up to her with a lifetime of devotion.”
Those words pierced Isabella's heart like needles.
She suddenly laughed.
As she laughed, tears streamed down her cheeks.
Everyone in the Ashford family said that because she insisted on marrying into the family, Joseph was struck down by an ancestral punishment and fell ill.
For the past three months, she had lived every day amidst insults and condemnation.
During the first few days of Joseph's coma, she was so heartbroken and cried so violently that she nearly lost sight in her right eye. She also developed a chronic ache in her heart, lying awake night after night.
When he was in bed with Sophia, she was kneeling before a cross, reciting the Rosary again and again, refusing to stop even when her fingers were rubbed raw and bleeding...
But it turned out... all of it was a lie!
The ridiculous rules of a century-old prestigious family, the so-called necessary test of loyalty...
All of it was just a grand-sounding excuse!
In essence, he just wanted to have his affair without restraint, while avoiding the judgment of his former self.
Tears blurred Isabella's vision. She didn't understand how things had come to this.
Joseph... he had loved her so genuinely, so clearly.
Back then, to pay for her mother's medical treatments, she had given up college and started diving for pearls to earn money. It was then she'd accidentally saved Joseph, who had been seriously injured and fallen into the sea while being pursued.
She took him home and cared for him for a month. To her surprise, Joseph fell madly in love with her and began to pursue her with passionate intensity.
She didn't believe in true love from a wealthy family and rejected him time and again. But he was relentlessly persistent, refusing to give up, using all his patience and gentleness to slowly melt her frozen heart.
What truly won her over was when Joseph shielded her from the sulfuric acid a competitor threw at her. A hideous scar was burned across his back, and though he was drenched in a cold sweat from the pain, he smiled and wiped away her tears: “As long as you're okay, that's all that matters.”
At their wedding, he knelt on one knee, held her hand, and vowed: “Isabella, I will love only you for the rest of my life. I will never let you suffer even the slightest bit of wrong.”
The words still echoed in her ears, now a bitter irony.
Isabella's tears had run dry, but the chatter and laughter in the living room continued.
Suddenly, someone sighed. “Joseph, Isabella has been Mrs. Ashford for five years. She's no fool. Aren't you afraid that if she finds out about Sophia... she'll leave you?”
Joseph was silent for a moment, his Adam's apple bobbing. “Then we'll just never let her know. Keep your mouths shut.”
His friend fell silent, but still asked cautiously, “What if she finds out... and wants a divorce?”
Joseph's lips curled into a smirk. “She loves me too much. How could she ever bear to leave me?”
“Besides, in all of Coastal Harbor, who would dare help her file for divorce without my consent?”
“And even if she did manage to run—” his gaze turned suddenly sharp, “I'd drag her back!
She's in the Ashford family tree. In this life, she's mine, in life and in death. She can only stay by my side.”
Isabella's breath hitched, her nails digging deep into her arm.
Joseph, you're wrong!
What makes you think I'd still love you after you've played me for a fool?
And what makes you think I can't leave you?
Isabella wiped her tears and, without a moment's hesitation, threw the Protective charm in her hand into the trash.
Then, she left without a word and did two things.
First, she went to her mother and told her about Joseph's affair.
Isabella's mother sighed deeply after hearing the story. ""I was against you marrying into a wealthy family back then. He knelt before me for ten days and nights, refusing to leave even after the rain gave him a high fever that turned into pneumonia. He wouldn't go to the hospital until I gave him my blessing. I truly thought he was a good man, but I never expected... Isabella, Mom supports you. Let's leave together.""
Second, she took her mother to begin the process of erasing their legal identity and changed her name.
Since Joseph said her name was in the family tree, and that she couldn't escape the Ashford family in life or death, she would make it so the person ""Isabella"" no longer existed in this world.
The process of erasing one's legal identity would take half a month. Isabella told her mother to wait patiently. She had to return to the Ashford family first, stay by Joseph's side, and not let him suspect anything was wrong.
Otherwise, with his methods, neither of them would be able to escape.
Isabella returned to the villa.
Unexpectedly, the moment she walked in, she saw a scene that felt like a blow to the head.
Joseph was on top of Sophia, riding her on the sofa. And what Sophia was wearing—
was her wedding dress!
Chapter 2
Chapter 2
The keys slipped from Isabella's hand, clattering to the floor.
Joseph frowned and turned his head. When he saw it was Isabella, he froze.
He quickly buckled his belt and zipped up his pants. By the time he looked up again, any trace of panic was gone from his face, replaced by the calm composure of a man in power.
""Isabella... why are you home?""
He asked with a smile.
Isabella's hand dug into her arm, pinching so hard it hurt.
After a long moment, she heard her own faint voice.
""Am I not allowed to come home now?""
Joseph chuckled. ""That's not what I meant. Weren't you at the church getting a protective charm for me?
Why are you back so suddenly?""
As he spoke, he raised his hand to stroke Isabella's hair, but she dodged him.
Joseph's smile froze on his face. ""Are you angry?
Just because I let Sophia wear one of your dresses?""
""One... dress.""
Isabella's voice trembled as she looked at Joseph in disbelief.
That was her most cherished wedding dress. She had sewn every single pearl on it by hand. Once, the first time she wore it, Joseph's eyes had been filled with awe. ""Isabella, you're so beautiful. This dress is worthy only of you.
From now on, you have to wear it for me every year.""
But now, he had let another woman wear it... and even do that kind of thing in it!
Isabella stared intently into his eyes, searching for a hint of guilt, but all she saw was a glaring sense of ease.
Her heart felt as if it had been violently squeezed, and the pain made it almost impossible for her to stand.
Was Joseph so certain... that she was so desperately in love with him that she would tolerate anything he did?
Joseph took a step forward, held Isabella's trembling hand, and softened his tone. ""Alright, don't be angry. I'll give you a hundred million. Go buy whatever you want.""
A flash of jealousy crossed Sophia's eyes. She suddenly knelt before Isabella, tears instantly welling up. ""Mrs. Ashford, I'm so sorry... It's all my fault. I just loved this wedding dress so much, and Mr. Ashford let me try it on...""
Though her words were an apology, every syllable stabbed at Isabella's heart, as if telling her: See how much he pampers me.
Sophia shot Isabella a triumphant glance, then began to cry even harder, ""Mrs. Ashford, please don't be angry, I'll take it off and give it back to you right now...""
Isabella's gaze swept over the glaring stain on the hem of the dress, and she said lightly, ""It's already dirty. I don't want it. You can keep it.""
Joseph frowned deeply, his voice grave, ""Isabella, don't be ridiculous. How can you just give away a wedding dress?""
Isabella curled her lip, just about to speak.
Just then, Joseph's phone rang.
He glanced at the caller ID, then looked at Sophia.
Sophia immediately forced an understanding smile: ""Mr. Ashford, don't mind me. Go ahead and take it.""
Joseph shook his head and said softly, ""You always get a headache when you hear me talk about business. I'll take this outside. Stop kneeling, get up first.""
With that, he stepped out.
Isabella stood frozen, her heart feeling as if it had been brutally pierced by a dull knife.
He never used to discuss business outside, as it involved trade secrets, but now he could even change that habit for Sophia,.
Only Isabella and Sophia were left in the living room.
Sophia patted her dress and stood up, the weakness on her face instantly transforming into arrogant provocation.
""You don't know, do you?
Joseph's strange illness was faked.""
She leaned in with a light laugh, ""It was all just to use the excuse of a ritual marriage to ward off misfortune, to bring me in legitimately.""
""We've been together for over a year, we've tried everything. Just because I said I hadn't tried having fun at his home yet, he immediately got 'sick'...""
""Isabella, his body and heart are with me now. What do you have besides the title?""
Isabella gave her a cool glance, ""The title can be yours too.""
Sophia froze, then grew furious: ""Who needs you to give it up!
He was mine to begin with!
The position you're occupying will be mine sooner or later!""
Seeing Isabella remain unmoved, she turned pale with anger.
Just then, the sound of Joseph's approaching footsteps came from outside the door.
A vicious look flashed in Sophia's eyes. She suddenly picked up the scalding hot teapot from the coffee table without hesitation, and smashed it against herself!
""Ah—!""
A shrill scream rang out as Sophia staggered and fell to the ground, her fair chest scalded red and covered in blisters.
She then struggled to crawl to Isabella's feet, crying and trembling: ""Mrs. Ashford, I was wrong, I shouldn't have worn your dress, please let me go...""
When Joseph rushed in, this was the scene that greeted him.
His face darkened instantly. He narrowed his eyes at Isabella, ""I've already compensated you. How dare you still hurt her? Apologize to her!""
""I didn't do it. I won't apologize.""
Isabella said calmly.
""Making excuses, are you?""
A dangerous glint flickered in Joseph's eyes, ""Fine. I'll make you admit it.""
Isabella was dragged to the sauna by bodyguards.
The moment the glass door was locked, the hot air felt like countless fine needles pricking her skin.
The needle on the thermometer climbed steadily.
50°C...
60°C...
70°C...
Isabella's face was flushed crimson, the steam making it hard for her to breathe.
Joseph stood outside the door, toying with the wedding ring on his finger, and asked in a low voice, ""Still not admitting it?""
Isabella threw herself against the door, pounding on it desperately. Her palms sizzled from the heat, leaving bloody handprints on the glass that evaporated in an instant.
“It really wasn't me, Joseph!
Why don't you check the security footage?”
She struggled in panic.
“No need. Sophia wouldn't lie to me. You, on the other hand, are becoming more and more disobedient.”
Joseph didn't look up, asking again: “Will you admit you were wrong?”
Isabella's body trembled uncontrollably. Joseph's favoritism for his lover had actually reached this point.
Her heart felt like it was tearing apart from the pain in the intense heat. She really couldn't take it anymore!
“I admit it...”
Her throat was cracked and dry as she rasped, forcing out the words and lying to him for the first time: “I was wrong.”
Joseph curled his lips in satisfaction, raising a hand slightly to signal the bodyguards to stop.
Isabella was let out, drenched in sweat, her body temperature alarmingly high.
Joseph looked at her wretched state, touching her chapped lips soothingly: “If you had just admitted your mistake earlier, you wouldn't have had to suffer.”
“You don't have to apologize to Sophia anymore, but—” His eyes darkened. “Don't let it happen again.”
Her vision darkened. Isabella's body went limp and she collapsed. The burned skin on her body stung fiercely, but the pain in her heart was even worse.
Tears streamed down her face uncontrollably.
She had a congenital heart condition; it was already a miracle she had lived this long.
Before, Joseph used to be so worried about her, not even letting the servants make a sound for fear of startling her.
He once held her and said: “You are my life. I can't let you get hurt in any way.”
But now, he had locked her in a room with life-threatening heat that could kill her at any moment.
It turned out that promises were only real the moment they were spoken.
Chapter 3
Chapter 3
Leaning against the wall, Isabella stumbled her way upstairs.
As soon as she entered her room, she pulled out everything related to Joseph.
The photos and love letters she once treasured, the postcards bought on their trips together...
She picked up an old sketchbook, and her movements suddenly froze.
It was something Joseph had drawn by hand, chronicling every step of their love story.
The first page: their first meeting by the sea. She had saved a blood-soaked Joseph, and he had fallen for her at first sight.
The tenth page: the first time he took her to the Ashford family home. Joseph's mother had told her to enter through the doggy door. She had turned and left, but Joseph chased after her, apologizing over and over: “Isabella, it's my fault. I didn't protect you. I let you be wronged. I promise it will never happen again.”
That time, he sent his mother to a mountain retreat for half a year.
The twentieth page: he announced in front of the entire clan that he would marry her. Grandfather Ashford dragged him to the ancestral hall, warning him that if he violated the family creed, he should beware of ancestral punishment.
Isabella would never forget that day. Joseph had sneered, throwing the ancestral memorial tablets into the fire and declaring in front of everyone: “I'm the head of the family now, so I make the rules. What do the ancestors matter?”
But now...
He was using “ancestral punishment” as an excuse to bring his lover into their home.
Isabella clutched the sketchbook tightly, suddenly remembering Grandfather Ashford's warning before their marriage:
“My grandson only likes obedient dogs. If you want to stay by his side, you have to be willing to be a good dog!”
At the time, she hadn't believed it, thinking Grandfather Ashford was just trying to scare her and break them up.
Now, she was beginning to understand. Joseph was the one in power; he only liked puppets who would obey him absolutely and depend on him forever.
And she, Isabella, would be no one's possession!
Without another moment of hesitation, she threw everything into the fireplace.
The moment she turned, she slammed right into Joseph's deep gaze.
He stared at the dancing flames, his voice devoid of emotion:
""What are you burning?""
Isabella lowered her eyes, her voice faint. ""Just some things I don't want anymore.""
Joseph nodded casually, taking out a first-aid kit to treat her wound. ""You see? Even after punishing you, your husband still dotes on you the most, coming to treat you himself.""
His hands were warm and dry, his movements gentle, but every inch of skin he touched felt bone-chillingly cold.
""Isabella, it's your mother's birthday in three days, . I plan to throw a grand celebration, inviting all the elites of Coastal Harbor.""
Isabella said faintly, ""There's no need. My mother doesn't like those kinds of occasions.""
""No.""
Joseph gently ruffled her hair, but his tone left no room for refusal. ""Be good. I must let everyone see just how much I spoil you.""
Isabella lowered her eyes, feeling no gratitude, only exhaustion.
Three days later.
The banquet was held at the largest hotel under the Ashford group, and nearly all of Coastal Harbor's high society was in attendance.
""Mr. Ashford spoils Mrs. Ashford so much, spending billions on his mother-in-law's birthday!""
""Mr. Ashford is truly the perfect man. I'm so jealous of Mrs. Ashford!""
""...""
Everyone was discussing how much Joseph doted on his wife.
But in a corner, Isabella's mother looked at the burn on Isabella's hand, her eyes red-rimmed. ""My daughter, you've suffered. Just hold on for another half a month, and Mom will take you away.""
Isabella's nose tingled, and she desperately wanted to cry, but fearing Joseph would notice something was wrong, she tilted her head back, forcing the tears to retreat.
Joseph took a call, then walked towards them.
""Isabella, Sophia said she wants to come celebrate your mother's birthday too...""
""I don't want to see her.""
Isabella said coldly.
Joseph's brow furrowed. ""Don't make a scene. She's already on her way. Don't you give her a hard time later.""
With that, he turned and left, his gaze fixed on the entrance, not sparing Isabella another glance.
Isabella stood there, stunned, her heart feeling as if a piece had been brutally gouged out.
Isabella's mother couldn't bear to watch anymore and pulled her out to the terrace.
The night wind was biting, bone-chillingly cold.
Isabella's motherpicked up a coat and draped it over her. ""Daughter, look, the moonlight is beautiful tonight. It will probably be a sunny day tomorrow.""
Isabella said softly, ""I hope so...""
Before the words had even faded, a rush of hurried footsteps approached.
Joseph's face was dark, and he seized her wrist, his grip so tight it nearly crushed her bones. ""Sophia has gone missing. Did you kidnap her?
Speak!
Where is she?""
Isabella's face turned pale with pain, but she straightened her back and met his gaze. ""It wasn't me.""
Joseph stared at her for a few seconds, then gave a cold smile. ""Fine. You won't admit it, will you? I'll make you talk!""
The cruelty that flashed in his eyes sent a chill down Isabella's spine.
Immediately after, he ordered sharply, ""Get me someone in here!
Take her mother away!""
Bodyguards immediately stepped forward and began to drag Isabella's mother out forcefully.
""Joseph, let my mother go!
Where are you taking her?""
Isabella tried to stop them frantically, but the man held her wrist in a death grip.
No matter how she struggled and cried out, Joseph didn't loosen his grip in the slightest.
In the opulent banquet hall.
Isabella was forced to her knees on the cold marble floor.
Joseph leaned back on the leather sofa, his long legs crossed. He took a slow drag from his cigarette, and through the swirling smoke, his cold voice emerged.
""Where is Sophia?""
Isabella shook her head numbly.
She couldn't remember how many times Joseph had asked her this. But she hadn't done it. She really didn't know.
Joseph stood up, stubbed out his cigarette, and forced Isabella's chin up. ""You're so disobedient.""
He beckoned with a finger. A bodyguard leaned over and handed him a phone, on which he played a video.
In the video, Isabella's mother was tied to a chair with a time bomb strapped to her chest. The numbers on the countdown timer ticked down relentlessly.
Chapter 4
Joseph's tone was deceptively gentle, but his gaze was as sharp as ice. ""Isabella, I'm only giving you a final fifty minutes.""
Isabella's face turned deathly pale.
She asked, trembling, ""If I can't find Sophia, will you really kill my mom?""
He leaned in close, his dark pupils reflecting her trembling form. ""You can try me.""
Isabella shuddered, and the tears she had been holding back for so long finally streamed down.
""Joseph, that's my mother! She's the most important person to me!
You can't do this to her!""
He let out a soft chuckle, but his eyes were terrifyingly cold. ""But Sophia is the most important person to me, too.""
""The most important?""
Isabella looked at him in disbelief. ""More important than me and my mom?""
Joseph's expression didn't change. ""Sophia gave me her first time. The poor girl offered herself in a ritual marriage to ward off misfortune and save me. I owe her a debt.
As for you, you will always be the one I love most.
How many times have I told you? I was going to send her away after the ritual marriage was over. Couldn't you just wait?
Did you have to go after her?""
Isabella stared at Joseph, a bone-chilling cold spreading through her chest.
The one he loved most?
Would the man who loved her most fake an illness for his mistress, deceive her, and even threaten to kill her mother?
Isabella had no patience to play along with his act. She was just about to expose his lies.
Suddenly, a bodyguard burst in, shouting, ""Mr. Ashford, we've found Ms. Miller!""
Joseph grabbed his suit jacket and headed for the door.
""What about my mom?""
Isabella lunged forward, desperately grabbing his pant leg. ""Let her go!""
Joseph glanced back over his shoulder, his gaze cold. ""The abandoned warehouse in the east district. Go find her yourself.""
Isabella bolted out the door like a madwoman, speeding all the way to the east district.
When she found her mother, she saw the bomb on her was still counting down!
Joseph hadn't even sent anyone to disarm it!
The ticking of the timer sounded like a death knell. There was only one minute left!
Isabella ripped the tape from her mother's mouth and tried to untie the ropes with trembling hands, but she couldn't get them loose.
""Daughter, forget about me! You have to go—"" Isabella's mother shook her head frantically.
Tears streamed down Isabella's face in panic. ""Mom, I won't leave you...""
Suddenly, Isabella's mother shoved her away with all her might, kicked her feet hard against the ground, and threw herself backward, chair and all—
Isabella let out a heart-wrenching scream: ""Mom—!""
A deafening explosion erupted, and the blast wave threw her violently through the air.
Isabella crashed hard onto the ground, her vision filled with nothing but red.
The hospital.
Isabella's mother was critically injured. Although she had survived, she might never wake up.
Isabella knelt by the hospital bed, tears streaming down her face: ""Mom, I'm so sorry, this is all my fault...""
She apologized over and over, but the person on the bed never responded.
Isabella's heart ached as if it were being torn apart.
Just a few hours ago, her mother had been smiling, holding her hand tightly, and comforting her in a soft voice.
But now, she could only lie here, completely still.
And all of this was caused by the man who claimed to love her!
Isabella cried until her voice was hoarse, finally passing out completely.
When she opened her eyes again.
Isabella found her hand being held. Joseph was by her bedside, his voice incredibly soft:
""I'm sorry, Isabella, it was all a misunderstanding. Sophia's phone just died, that's why she was unreachable.""
""I acted rashly.""
Isabella coldly pulled her hand back, a wave of icy sarcasm washing over her heart.
This was the man who said he loved her most?
Just because Sophia didn't answer her phone, he kidnapped her mother without even checking!
""Isabella, don't be angry. After all, you've targeted her before, that's why I suspected you..."" Joseph's eyes were red, his voice low and hoarse. ""Why don't you hit me, or curse me, anything you want...""
Bang—
The hospital room door was suddenly pushed open, and Sophia burst in, her eyes swollen like peaches: ""Mrs. Ashford, it's all my fault, please don't blame Mr. Ashford...""
She fell to her knees, weeping gracefully: ""If only I had charged my phone in time, Mr. Ashford wouldn't have been so worried about me that he kidnapped your mother, and she wouldn't be in this state...""
Isabella's nails dug fiercely into her palm. Sophia was clearly here to provoke her!
Just as she was about to throw them out, she saw Joseph bend down to help Sophia up, his tone gentle: ""This has nothing to do with you. Stop crying, it's not good for you.""
Watching this scene, Isabella's heart felt cold and bitter.
How ironic. Her mother had almost died and was still unconscious from serious injuries, yet he was worried about another woman ""crying.""
""Get out!""
Isabella's voice was hoarse. ""Both of you, get out!""
Joseph was stunned: ""Isabella...""
""Get lost!""
She suddenly grabbed the vase from the bedside table and smashed it violently on the floor.
Joseph stood up. ""Isabella, calm down first. I'll make it up to you in a few days.""
With that, he left, shielding Sophia as he went.
The moment the door closed, Isabella could no longer hold back and burst into tears.
She didn't want any compensation...
She didn't want anything, only for her mother to open her eyes and look at her one more time.
Chapter 5
Chapter 5
Over the next few days, Joseph tried all sorts of ways to win Isabella's favor.
The latest jewelry, limited-edition bags, flowers flown in from abroad... but Isabella didn't even glance at them.
Until Joseph brought in a titan of the medical world—Dr. Peter.
""Mrs. Ashford, the bomb only caused superficial wounds. Your mother is in a coma because she hit her head on a rock. As long as we perform a craniotomy, she should wake up in about a week. However, this surgery is extremely dangerous, and I'm the only one in the world who can perform it.""
Isabella was ecstatic, thanking him repeatedly.
Dr. Peter waved his hand. ""I stopped operating a long time ago.""
""If Mr. Ashford hadn't given up fifty percent of his profits and stood in the rain outside my house all night, I would never have made an exception.""
Isabella looked at Joseph, her expression complicated.
After a long silence, she said in a low voice, ""Thank you, Mr. Ashford.""
Joseph froze, a flicker of hurt in his eyes. ""Isabella, stop this... Don't treat me like this, okay?""
Isabella turned her head, avoiding his gaze.
In the past, whenever he made her angry, he would humble himself just like this to coax her, and Isabella would always soften and forgive him.
But this time was different.
He had nearly killed her mother. She couldn't forgive him.
During the surgery, Joseph stayed by Isabella's side, never leaving for a moment.
He sat with her on the hallway bench, handing her water and food, occasionally squeezing her hand and comforting her softly, ""Don't be afraid. Mom will be fine.""
Isabella suddenly remembered the year they had just married, when her mother had surgery. He had been just as gentle and patient with her then.
Gazing at the soft profile of his face, she was lost in a daze for a moment, as if everything had gone back to how it was before.
If only he didn't reek of Sophia's perfume.
Isabella's mother surgery was success.
The next day, Isabella was heading out to buy some daily necessities.
But she was stopped in the parking lot.
It was Sophia.
She smiled dazzlingly. ""Do you really think Joseph cares about you and your mother?
Let me tell you, the day your mother was unconscious, he was in high spirits. He pinned me down and took me three times. We went at it until dawn.""
Isabella was already dead inside. ""What do you want?""
""I want you to step aside.""
""Soon.""
Isabella looked at her calmly. ""I will step aside completely.""
Sophia narrowed her eyes, her thoughts unreadable. Just as Isabella thought she believed her, the next moment, Sophia suddenly threw herself against the front of the car and collapsed to the ground, covered in blood.
Isabella was completely stunned. The car wasn't even on. Even if it had hit her, it wouldn't have been this severe.
So where did all that blood on her come from?
Before Isabella could figure it out, Joseph had already rushed over.
Sophia smiled weakly at him. ""Mr. Ashford, don't blame Mrs. Ashford. She's just in a bad mood because of her mother...""
Before she could finish, Sophia violently coughed up a mouthful of blood and fainted.
Without a word, Joseph dragged Isabella out of the car and raised his hand, delivering a resounding slap!
Smack!
Isabella's head snapped to the side, a ringing in her ears.
""Isabella!
Didn't I already get Dr. Peterson to cure your mother?
Why are you still taking it out on Sophia?""
""She threw herself onto the car.""
Isabella replied coldly.
""Still lying!""
Joseph's gaze was as cold as a blade. ""How could Sophia possibly throw herself onto your car?""
He gave her no chance to explain, directly ordering his men to tie her down for a blood donation.
As Isabella was forcibly held down in the donation chair, she was still struggling. ""There are security cameras!
Go check the footage...""
""Don't try to stall.""
Joseph cut her off coldly, his eyes sinister. ""If anything happens to Sophia, I'll make your mother pay with her life.""
Hearing his threat, Isabella abruptly stopped struggling, her hands falling helplessly to her sides.
When the needle pierced her vein, the pain made her fingertips tremble.
But the pain in her heart was a thousand, ten thousand times worse.
She had always been terrified of needles. In the past, whenever she had her blood drawn, Joseph would cover her eyes and coax her softly, ""Be good, Isabella. It'll be over in a second.""
But now, he only stared at the blood bag, relentlessly urging the nurse: ""Faster!
Draw it faster!""
Completely ignoring her pale face and cold body.
The blood bag gradually filled, and her vision blurred bit by bit.
When they reached 800cc, the nurse couldn't help but speak up: ""This young lady has a heart condition. If you keep drawing blood, her heart won't be able to take it. She could go into cardiac arrest...""
Joseph looked at Isabella's bloodless face, his fingertips trembled, but he still gave the cold order:
""Continue.""
Isabella closed her eyes in despair. So, he really didn't care if she lived or died.
In that moment, her heart died completely!
A wave of dizziness washed over her. The last thing she saw was Joseph's back as he rushed out, clutching the bag of her blood...
Immediately after, the nurse screamed: ""We need to resuscitate!
The patient is in cardiac arrest!""
Chapter 6
Chapter 6
Isabella was woken by pain.
The incandescent light overhead stung her eyes. She subconsciously tried to raise a hand to shield them, but the movement pulled at the wound on her chest, the pain so sharp it made her gasp.
""You're finally awake.""
The nurse, who was changing her dressing, let out a sigh of relief. ""We've been trying to save you for three days, you almost didn't make it... Luckily, the new artificial heart saved you.
But the damage to your body is severe. If you can't find a suitable heart for transplant within three years, I'm afraid you won't survive...""
Isabella stared at the ceiling, the light gone from her eyes.
She raised a hand to her chest. It was completely still.
The heart that once beat for Joseph was gone.
And her love for him was completely exhausted.
The nurse, worried about her, couldn't help but ask: ""Should I go get Mr. Ashford?""
Isabella shook her head: ""Don't tell him.""
The nurse was confused: ""Why not?
Isn't he your husband?""
""No.""
Isabella's voice was as faint as a wisp of smoke: ""He won't be for much longer.""
The door to the hospital room was suddenly thrown open. Joseph stood in the doorway, his brow slightly furrowed: ""What did you say?""
The nurse made a quick, awkward exit.
Joseph walked to the bedside and asked in a low voice: ""Are you angry with me because of the blood donation?""
Isabella didn't speak, nor did she look up at him.
Joseph lifted her chin, forcing Isabella to look up: ""You made a mistake and now you're taking it out on others. Why are you being so unreasonable?""
A red mark appeared on Isabella's fair chin where he gripped it. She only asked faintly: ""Is there something you need?""
Joseph released her, his tone softening slightly, ""Peter said, Mom should wake up tomorrow.""
In that moment, Isabella's dead heart beat once more!
The next day, before the sun was even up, she rushed to her mother's hospital room.
But just as she reached the door, she saw Sophia disconnecting her mother's ventilator!
Isabella's pupils contracted, and she screamed hoarsely: ""Stop!""
Sophia looked up, smiling viciously: ""Isabella, you can't stop me. Your mother's life is mine.""
With that, she shoved Isabella hard.
Isabella stumbled and fell, the surgical wound on her chest tearing in agony.
She forced herself to crawl up, protectively standing in front of her mother's bed.
""Get out!
Don't you dare touch my mom!""
Sophia was about to step forward when she caught a glimpse of a figure outside the door. She suddenly collapsed to the floor, tears instantly welling up: ""Mrs. Ashford, I already told you, Mr. Ashford sent me to borrow it. Why did you have to push me...""
What Joseph saw when he walked in was Sophia, fallen and crying. His face immediately darkened: ""Isabella! You're bullying her again!""
Isabella trembled all over: ""You sent her to take my mother's ventilator?""
Joseph's expression was calm: ""You injured Sophia's lungs. She's been using a ventilator recently. Hers suddenly broke this morning, and the new one hasn't arrived yet. I told her to come to Mom's room to borrow it for a while.""
Isabella felt as if she had been plunged into an ice cave, unable to believe her ears.
""Joseph, my mother isn't awake yet. She'll die if you unplug the ventilator.""
Her voice trembled to its limit, but Joseph was unconcerned.
""Peter said Mom is fine. It's just for a little while, she won't die.""
Isabella clenched her fists tightly, the taste of blood spreading from the tip of her tongue. ""Joseph, you can't risk my mother's life! If my mother dies, I will never forgive you!""
Joseph's thin lips tightened, and he seemed to hesitate.
Just then, Sophia suddenly clutched her chest, gasping for air: ""Mr. Ashford, I feel so awful, I can barely breathe...""
Joseph no longer hesitated, ordering in a deep voice: ""Pull the tube!""
""Don't!"" Isabella desperately grabbed his arm, pleading, ""I'm begging you, you can't...""
""Enough! Do you think you haven't been punished enough?"" Joseph cut her off sharply, his tone leaving no room for argument: ""I said your mother won't die, so she won't die.""
With that, he flung her away and had the bodyguards drag her to a corner.
Isabella knelt on the floor, watching helplessly as her mother's breathing tube was removed. She cried and begged until her voice was hoarse, but Joseph remained unmoved, leaving with Sophia in his arms without a backward glance.
Suddenly, the heart monitor let out a piercing, continuous shriek—
On the screen, Isabella's mother's heartbeat became a flat line.
Isabella frantically pressed the emergency call button, but no one responded.
She burst out of the room like a madwoman, screaming down the empty hallway: ""Is there a doctor! Please, save my mother! She's dying!""
The entire floor was deathly silent.
A desperate thought flashed through her mind: Joseph, to punish her, was deliberately preventing the doctors from saving her mother.
She turned and bolted down the stairs, missing a step and falling hard, but she ignored the pain, scrambled up, and kept running.
She pounded on doors floor after floor, running a full eight floors before she found a doctor.
But by the time the doctor arrived, Isabella's mother was no longer breathing.
Just one more day, and her mother would have woken up!
Just one more day...
Isabella stared blankly at her mother's ashen face, her entire being feeling as if her soul had been ripped out. She opened her mouth, but no sound came out.
She realized that the most extreme pain is one that you cannot cry from.
Joseph, I regret it. I regret ever loving you.
I regret it so much.

I’m 26M and I’ve realised that I’ve never actually gone on a proper date in my life. Not because I don’t want to — I just never really tried, and now I’m at a point where I want to learn how to meet someone new without overthinking it.

So I’m looking for something very simple and pressure-free:
a blind coffee date or grabbing something to eat together.
That’s it. No expectations, nothing beyond a casual meet. Just two people chatting, laughing a bit, and seeing if we vibe as humans.

I’m doing this mainly to get comfortable meeting someone new, understanding how dates feel, and improving my social confidence.

About me:
– Working professional
– Friendly, respectful, and decent conversationalist
– No drama, not looking for anything intense
– Open-minded, clean, and chill

Even fictional women, I just watched this movie in theatres that I thought would be funny and it was of course very funny but it was also so sweet and touching. However only a few minutes after I left the theatre I had this intense sadness in me. I just couldn’t understand how she got two choices, two! 
I mean I know it’s a horrible situation to have to pick between two amazing men who love you (my goodness, how devastating), but I just can’t sit here and pretend like I wasn’t wishing to be that girl. 

Some of us get absolutely no choice. I’ve never been in love. It’s all I’ve dreamt of since I was a baby and I’ve never felt it. I’ve never seen it in real life, my parents weren’t in love. It’s literally in the forefront of my mind every single day. 

I want a love like the movies so bad, I know I’m young and everyone says I have so much ahead of me but I’m just so tired of being so lonely, it’s like dating is impossible for me. 

I just don’t understand how some girls can have so much love in one lifetime but I can’t have any. I mean what are the odds? What am I doing wrong? I’ve changed my body and hair and makeup so much this year. I’ve tried different things, I’ve picked up hobbies I thought I lost to depression. But it’s still not enough. 

I wish I could be held softly, and known fully inside and out.

I mean Christ I wish someone would love me so much that they pay attention to the damn length of my hair at different points of my life like what???? (That movie was so good omg)

1p8jlgm,https://i.redd.it/dwix9smatw3g1.jpeg,Looking for a free link for When Love Turns to Lies,"When Love Turns to Lies

In the tenth year of Emilia Hutchinson's marriage to Samuel Elsham, she received a hotel check-in notification text.

The hotel was right across from Samuel's office, and the message clearly read ""Couple's King Room 520.""

Emilia's best friend, Paisley Ralfe, snatched the phone from her hand, her voice strained with urgency.

""Emmie! Who books a couple's suite for business these days? Samuel must be cheating!""

Emilia took a slow sip of coffee, then chuckled softly.

""That's impossible. If Samuel could cheat on me, I could grow wings and fly, and I'd probably win the lottery too.""

She knew better than anyone just how much Samuel loved her.

Back then, she'd been severely burned in a fire with second-degree injuries, and her lower body was soaked in blood.

She was issued six critical condition notices in one night—even her parents thought she was at death's door.

But Samuel stood outside the operating room with a pale face, insisting she would pull through.

That night felt like a miracle.

It wasn't until later that Emilia learned Samuel had signed a consent form for voluntary living organ donation.

He'd been prepared to trade his own life for hers, just to keep her safe.

So how could a man who was willing to die for her ever cheat?

Thinking this, Emilia casually moved the text to the trash and went back to her dessert. Soon enough, she forgot all about it.

The moment came on Samuel's birthday. He had just closed his eyes to make a wish when a text message appeared on his phone.

It was from a local number.

""The room is ready, same place as usual.

""Darling, aren't you coming to get your birthday present?""

***

Emilia froze, and her eyes widened.

Her face paled as she stared at the words, repeating them to herself. ""Darling? Birthday present?""

She stumbled backward, her lower back hitting the edge of the table, creating a loud thud. A sharp, stabbing pain shot through her, and she gasped.

Samuel cut his wish short and rushed over in a single step.

He dropped to one knee. His voice was laced with anxiety. ""Where does it hurt? Show me.""

Emilia looked at him, stunned.

His eyes were filled with worry, his breathing uneven with anxiety.

That instinctive, immediate reaction told her everything—he loved her. Deeply, genuinely. A love that was all-consuming and unreserved.

But then why was he the one getting that suggestive text?

She could hardly believe the man who was so gentle and attentive could be the same person who booked a hotel room to cheat on her.

Samuel was known for his easygoing nature — except when it came to his wife. That was the one line no one could cross.

He might ride a shared bike to work, but Emilia always rode in the most comfortable luxury car.

He might humble himself and bow during business negotiations, but Emilia always held her head high.

He might fix light bulbs and lift heavy things with his own hands, but Emilia's hands were only for playing the piano.

Emilia had always believed she was the happiest woman in the world, blessed with the purest love imaginable.

But now, that glaring text message shattered her illusion completely.

And the one who had shattered it with his own hands was actually the person closest to her—the one she trusted most.

""Emmie, there's an issue with the company documents. I need to head back to the office.""

By the time Samuel said this, he was already at the door.

Emilia's heart sank. For the first time, she spoke up to stop him.

""But you haven't even eaten your cake yet. What kind of document is so urgent that you have to leave right now?""

After ten years of marriage, Samuel had never refused any of Emilia's requests.

But this time, he gestured helplessly at his phone.

""Look, this mistake is really serious. I have to handle it myself.""

He ruffled her hair. ""Be good and wait for me at home.""

The moment the door closed, Emilia's hand trembled so violently she could barely hold her phone.

Was Samuel in such a hurry to meet that woman? Hurrying so much he'd leave her alone at home without a second thought?

A sharp, cramping pain shot through her chest.

She snatched the car keys from the coffee table and hurried after him.

The early autumn night air seeped through the car window cracks, carrying a sharp chill.

She gripped the steering wheel tightly, her eyes locked on the familiar Maybach ahead.

When she saw the car pull over slowly at the company entrance, her tense nerves eased slightly—maybe she'd been overthinking things after all.

Samuel loved her more than life itself; how could he possibly cheat?

Just as guilt began to creep in for doubting him, Emilia's eyes widened in shock.

The familiar figure she knew so well was striding briskly toward the hotel across the street.

Her phone buzzed suddenly.

""Emmie, I'm here."" Alongside the text was a photo of the company entrance.

""I might have to pull an all-nighter today. Go to bed early.""

She stared at the screen, her knuckles turning white as a buzzing filled her ears.

So that was why he'd parked at the company—just to cover his tracks.

So the hotel check-in text from five days ago wasn't a prank after all. He really had been cheating.

Her chest felt so heavy it hurt to breathe, every inhale dragging against a sharp, stabbing pain.

Even though she'd braced herself for the worst, seeing the truth confirmed still made her world collapse.

A decade of marriage, the love she'd been most proud of. It had all become one big joke.

Tears blurred her vision, and suddenly she remembered the vow Samuel had made at their wedding.

""If I ever betray Emilia in this lifetime, may I be condemned to hell forever, never to be reborn.""

Emilia mumbled, ""Samuel, would you dare repeat that vow now?""

***

It was 6:00 am, and the sky was still dark.

Emilia finally spotted that figure—Samuel had his arm around a woman as they walked out of the hotel, his fingertips lingering on her waist in an intimate gesture.

When she got a clear look at the woman's face, her eyes widened in shock.

It was Lyanna Kirchman.

The same crazy woman who'd stripped off her clothes chasing Samuel in high school, only to be dragged away by security.

The same obsessive person Samuel had publicly mocked, saying, ""Just the sight of you makes me sick.""

And now she was the one Samuel was cheating with.

Before Emilia could process it all, Lyanna suddenly started walking toward her.

Ignoring her stunned expression, Lyanna played a video right in front of her.

""You must be wondering why it's me, right?""

She gave a cold laugh. ""After watching this, you'll understand.""

Emilia took the phone with trembling hands.

She'd braced herself for what she might see, but when the images appeared, a wave of nausea still surged from her stomach, forcing her to roll down the car window and retch violently.

In the video, Samuel had Lyanna pinned beneath him, his movements rough and unrestrained.

Afterward, he stood shirtless at the window, lighting a cigarette. His voice was a low rasp as he flicked the ash.

""I told you not to be so demanding. Pick times when Emmie isn't home.""

His tone was so gentle it almost sounded affectionate, but Lyanna scoffed. ""If you love her that much, why haven't you touched her in ten years?""

Samuel's expression froze, his eyes dark and unreadable.

He took a deep drag from the cigarette, the smoke obscuring his face.

""Not touching her doesn't mean I don't love her.

""It's just..."" His voice suddenly grew strained.

""After that fire ten years ago, Emmie was left with large burn scars on her thighs. Every time we tried to be intimate, the moment I saw those scars, I just...""

""Just what?"" Lyanna pushed on.

Samuel stubbed out the cigarette, his voice dropping to nearly a whisper. ""I just feel sick to my stomach.""

Emilia clutched the phone, her knuckles white as a roaring buzz filled her ears.

She was the one who'd rushed into the fire ten years ago and dragged him out with all her strength.

Back then, he'd cried and promised to treat her well for the rest of his life.

But now, the scars she'd risked her life for had become a flaw in his eyes.

When he felt disgusted by her scars, he forgot that without her, he would have died in that fire long ago.


Chapter 2

A sudden fire erupted at the Elsham's residence ten years ago, the home where Samuel lived.

As the flames spread, everyone scrambled to save themselves—including Samuel's own parents.

But Emilia went against the tide, rushing into the blazing inferno without hesitation.

When she carried the unconscious Samuel out on her back, she got trapped as the roof beams collapsed.

By the time firefighters rescued her, 40% of her body was burned, and she was covered in blood.

The day she woke up in the ICU, she weakly said she wanted to break up.

Samuel cried until he could barely breathe, repeating ""I don't care"" over and over.

Back then, she'd foolishly believed she'd finally found someone who could see past her appearance and love her for who she was inside.

It wasn't until today that she realized all those vows were lies, and every ""I don't care"" was just a carefully rehearsed line.

Samuel not only cared, he cared to an almost pathological degree.

He cared so much that he hadn't touched her once in ten years of marriage.

He cared so much that he gave her his ""love"" but reserved his intimacy for another woman.

He cared so much that he found her scars downright repulsive.

""Emilia, you saw the video too. Every time Samuel looks at your scars, he's disgusted. The only reason he's staying in this marriage is to repay the debt from you saving his life.

""If you really love him, you should let him go. Stop using that fire as leverage and turning yourself into some pathetic charity case. That just makes me lose even more respect for you.""

Lyanna's sarcastic words cut deep, finally snapping Emilia out of her trance.

""Ms. Kirchman,"" her voice was soft but carried a razor-sharp edge that demanded attention.

""A homewrecker who inserts herself into other people's marriages seems far more deserving of being belittled.""

Without another glance at the furious Lyanna, Emilia turned the car around and sped away.

Emilia's knuckles turned white as she gripped the steering wheel, the scenery outside blurring into an indistinguishable mess.

Emilia pulled her car over to the side of the road.

Tears finally broke through and streamed down her cheeks.

Once the crying subsided, she pulled out her phone and dialed the familiar number.

""Dad, I'll go abroad and live with you.

""As for the arranged marriage... it can be anyone. I don't care anymore.""

Her father's surprised questions came through the other end, but she just hung up in silence.

When the phone screen went dark, she remembered the girl she was ten years ago.

How determined she'd been to refuse the arranged marriage back then, and how confidently she'd run toward what she believed was true love.

Yet in the end, all she got in return was a remark about how it made him sick to his stomach.

Since sincere devotion only led to betrayal, she might as well agree to the family's arranged marriage.

At least it would be more dignified than this decade of so-called ""love.""

***

Early the next morning, Emilia placed the pre-prepared divorce agreement among the documents waiting for Samuel's signature.

She stood by the door and watched as he picked up a fountain pen, ready to sign. But the tip paused just above the paper.

Samuel frowned slightly and was about to flip through the document when his phone vibrated.

The caller ID showed a local number.

He answered with an unchanged expression.

""Out of credit again? Fine, I'll handle it at the office.""

After hanging up, he casually signed the divorce agreement. As he stood, he suddenly pressed a warm kiss to her forehead.

""I've been too busy to spend time with you lately. Come to the dinner party with me tonight.""

His suit brushed past her shoulder, carrying that familiar musky scent—the exact same one she'd smelled on Lyanna.

She clutched the signed divorce agreement tightly, watching Samuel walk away. Her heart felt like it had plunged into an ice cellar.

Half an hour later, Emilia received a message from Lyanna on her phone.

It was a video.

In it, Samuel had Lyanna pressed against the floor-to-ceiling window of his office.

A woman's breathy moans could be heard. ""Mr. Elsham, are you satisfied with my service?""

""Five-star review,"" he replied in a husky voice, thick with passion.

The video finally froze on their wedding photo—in the picture, he was sliding a ring onto her finger.

Yet the groom, who looked so tender and loving in that photo, was now tangled up with another woman right beneath their wedding photo.

Emilia suddenly tasted the metallic tang of blood in her mouth and realized her palm had been pierced by her own fingernails.

Memories flashed through her mind like a reel of film—Samuel's retreating figure, always rushing out the door whenever he got a call from that local number.

Those ""urgent company matters"" she'd never questioned, those nights he always came home smelling of the same perfume.

It turned out every ""bill reminder call"" from that number was actually a signal for his secret meetings with Lyanna.

Yet to Samuel, she'd been nothing but a fool — toyed with for ten long years!


Chapter 3

Emilia's face went pale as she collapsed weakly onto the floor, all her strength gone.

She had thought there was at least some genuine feeling in this marriage but never expected it to be built on betrayal from the very beginning.

Shakily pushing herself up, she grabbed a decorative piece from the coffee table and smashed it hard against the wedding photo on the wall.

With a loud crash, the flying shards hit and shattered the antique vase on the display shelf—a piece worth 25 million dollars.

It was Samuel's most prized possession. Normally, he wouldn't even let the housekeepers near it.

""What do you think you're doing?""

Samuel's furious shout came from the doorway. Emilia watched him stride quickly toward her.

Emilia instinctively apologized, ""I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...""

Before she could finish, he grabbed her wrist.

""Who cares about the vase? Are you hurt anywhere? Let me check!""

Glancing at the shards scattered across the floor, she hesitated. ""But you spent 25 million dollars on it...""

""Don't be silly,"" he chuckled softly. ""Even if all the antiques in the world were smashed, they wouldn't be worth a single strand of your hair.""

There was a time when Emilia would have been moved to tears by this.

But now, looking at the man who seemed so affectionate.

All Emilia felt was hypocrisy and disgust.

She couldn't help but wonder how many times Samuel had said those same words to another woman.

""Emmie, hurry up and change. We'll be late for the banquet.""

Samuel's urgent voice snapped Emilia back to reality.

Only then did she remember he'd mentioned taking her to a banquet tonight.

As she met his gaze and took the formal dress, her fingertips made contact with the fabric, prompting an instinctive frown.

It was another long dress.

Since the fire ten years ago, none of the formal dresses Samuel had picked out for her were short.

In the past, she hadn't dared to wear short skirts because of her insecurity, but now...

""Is there a short skirt?"" She looked Samuel directly in the eyes. ""I want to wear a short skirt.""

A flicker of surprise crossed the man's face, but he quickly composed himself.

""Be reasonable. Long skirts are for your protection.""

""I don't need that kind of protection,"" Emilia insisted stubbornly. ""There's nothing shameful about my scars.""

After several failed attempts to persuade her, Samuel's frown deepened.

""Everyone coming tonight is a prominent figure in Boston. What would people think if you wore a short skirt?"" His voice suddenly rose.

""There will be children at the event too. Who's going to take responsibility if you scare them?""

Emilia's eyes widened. This was the first time he had spoken to her like this in their ten years of marriage.

It felt more like the true thoughts he'd been hiding all along.

""So... you think I'm terrifying?"" Her voice shook. ""That I don't even have the right to wear a short skirt?""

Only then did Samuel realize he'd lost his temper. He quickly softened his tone. ""That's not what I meant...

""The banquet requires all female guests to wear long skirts,"" he said, lowering his voice. ""I specifically asked them to make that rule.""

After that, Emilia changed into the long skirt under Samuel's persistent coaxing and pressure.

Arriving at the venue in elegant attire, Emilia linked arms with Samuel as they made their entrance.

Envious murmurs reached her ears.

""Wow, Mr. Elsham really dotes on Mrs. Elsham! Just because she has scars on her legs, he specifically requested all female guests to wear long dresses. What kind of fairy-tale love is this?""

""Absolutely! I heard the scars Mrs. Elsham got from that fire were really severe, but Mr. Elsham has stayed by her side for ten years. This is what true devotion means!""

Hearing this, Emilia dug her fingertips deep into her palm. These seemingly envious praises cut at her heart like a blunt knife with every word.

In others' eyes, she would always be the one receiving charity—a flawed person who needed her husband's pity.

On the other hand, Samuel would always be that lofty savior on a pedestal.

Emilia had just sat down when a shrill gasp cut through the banquet hall chatter.

""My goodness! Who is that? Didn't Mr. Elsham explicitly require everyone to wear long dresses?""

All eyes turned sharply toward the entrance.

Emilia looked up, and her breath got caught in her throat.

Lyanna was stepping in on stiletto heels, wearing a miniskirt. Her long fair legs glinted under the lights, dazzling to the point of harshness.

""She's doing this on purpose, right? Knowing full well that Mrs. Elsham..."" The voice trailed off abruptly.

Lyanna acted as if she hadn't heard the remarks and walked straight to the head table.

She extended her hand to Samuel and said, ""Mr. Elsham, I'm truly sorry. But I couldn't find a single long dress in my wardrobe.

""Both you and your wife wouldn't mind, right?""


Chapter 4

The banquet hall fell deathly silent instantly, with all eyes fixed on the dramatic scene.

Everyone knew Samuel hated it when someone mentioned his wife's scars. Lyanna was practically dancing on thin ice.

They all held their breath, waiting for Samuel to fly into a rage. Normally, bodyguards would have already dragged this reckless woman out by now.

Yet Samuel only swallowed hard and snapped out a few cold words. ""Don't let it happen again.""

The entire table erupted in an uproar, with murmurs spreading everywhere.

""What on earth is the relationship between Lyanna and Mr. Elsham? He's being far too lenient with her.""

""By doing this in front of everyone, isn't Mr. Elsham just embarrassing Mrs. Elsham?""

At these words, a victorious smile curved Lyanna's red lips as she immediately took a seat beside Samuel.

It wasn't until he saw Emilia's face drain completely of color that Samuel spoke up to explain.

""There are three reasons I'm not losing my temper. Firstly, it was out of consideration for our old classmate friendship; secondly, to account for the cooperation between the Elsham Group and the Kirchman family; and most importantly...""

Samuel lowered his voice. ""If I lose my temper in public, it will only confirm that you're narrow-minded.""

Emilia gripped the napkin tightly, her knuckles turning pale.

Looking at Lyanna's smooth legs beneath the short skirt, she suddenly let out a self-deprecating laugh.

It turned out short skirts weren't forbidden at the banquet at all—only she, Emilia, this woman with ""horrific scars,"" wasn't worthy of wearing one.

Instead of arguing with Samuel, Emilia kept downing cocktails one after another.

The burning liquor sliding down her throat couldn't suppress the coldness rising in her chest.

When she inadvertently lowered her head, the sight before her made her blood run cold. Lyanna's toes were ambiguously tangling around the hem of Samuel's pants.

Samuel's long fingers were repeatedly caressing Lyanna's smooth thigh beneath the tablecloth.

She tightened her grip on the wine glass.

How dare they put on such a filthy display right in front of her, under everyone's gaze?

If there had been a bed in the banquet hall, they probably couldn't wait to...

A wave of nausea rose in her throat. This man she'd loved for ten years now made her so disgusted that her whole body trembled.

Just as Emilia was about to flee through the door, a scream cut through the banquet hall commotion.

""Fire! Run!""

In an instant, thick smoke flooded her lungs.

She trembled as she fumbled through the thick smoke, her throat scorched by the heat, forcing out broken cries.

""Samuel... kaff... kaff... where are you?""

The only response came from Samuel's familiar voice drifting from the emergency exit. ""Lyanna! Watch where you're going!""

""Why are you snapping at me?""

""Hold onto me tight! Do you want second-degree burns too?""

Amid the rolling heat, Emilia felt as if she'd plummeted into an ice cellar.

The man she'd risked her life to drag from the fire ten years ago was now holding another woman, stepping into the light without looking back.

What was even more absurd was that he clearly remembered how badly she'd been hurt and how terrified she would be.

Yet from start to finish, he never once looked back at her—not even once.

All he left her with was the memory of that beam that had scarred her legs ten years ago and the echoing crash of it plummeting in her mind.

Emilia's heart felt as if it had been torn open; every breath carried a stabbing pain laced with the metallic tang of blood.

At that moment, she desperately wanted to grab that resolute, departing figure and scream at him.

""Samuel, when you were clutching Lyanna and fleeing for your life—did you ever remember that ten years ago, there was also a girl who rushed into the fire, trading her body covered in burns for a glimmer of hope to save yours?""

But before she could even open her mouth, the thick smoke stole her consciousness completely.

She didn't know how long she'd been unconscious. In a daze, she heard shocked cries. ""Mr. Elsham! Don't go in!""

Several senior executives clung to his suit. ""The fire department will be here in three minutes! You'll die if you go in now! Thousands of the Elsham Group employees depend on you!""

Samuel tore off his tie. The back of his hand, scorched by flying embers, bulged with veins. ""If the Elsham Group loses me, they can just hire a new CEO...""

He kicked open the crumbling doorframe, his roar drowned by explosions.

""But I'm the only one my wife has!""

With that, Samuel rushed toward her without hesitation.

He took her hand, his voice broken and unsteady. ""Emmie, look at me! Please... don't fall asleep...""

Emilia heard his words, but not a single ripple stirred in her heart anymore.

The last bit of love she had for Samuel had died in the fire where he turned and left her.

As for watching his anxious expression when he finally came back to save her, all she wanted to say was. That kind of belated devotion didn't count for anything at all.

Her heart grew colder while her body temperature rose higher.

In the final moment before her consciousness faded, Emilia had only one thought—regret. She regretted saving him.

And she regretted even more believing in his so-called sincerity and marrying him.

***

When she woke up again, Samuel's anxious voice was by her ear.

""Emmie, how do you feel? Is there any discomfort?""


Chapter 5

Emilia didn't answer; she just pressed her lips tightly together and remained silent.

Watching Emilia's reaction, Samuel felt panic surge in his chest.

He took Emilia's hand, his voice trembling with guilt.

""Emmie, I'm sorry. I came too late.

""The scene was such a mess back then. I thought you'd already escaped on your own. I never expected...""

If she hadn't seen it with her own eyes, she might have believed him.

But now, all she could think was how good Samuel was at acting. It was so good that he almost fooled himself.

Her lips turned pale, her voice weak and hoarse.

""I see. Please go out for now. I want to be alone for a while.""

After speaking, Emilia turned her head away before Samuel could say anything.

Seeing this, Samuel simply assumed Emilia was still in poor condition after waking up, so he turned and left the ward.

After Samuel left, Emilia stared blankly out the window.

The sun was bright—blindingly so—but it couldn't reach the emptiness that had long settled in her heart.

So this was what it felt like to be utterly disappointed.

Just then, her phone vibrated; it was a call from her father, Howard Hutchinson.

He asked when she would go abroad and what date her flight was.

She reached out as if touching the sunlight, her voice light as a feather.

""In a week. I'll leave once the paperwork is done.""

The call had just ended when Samuel's flustered voice came from the doorway.

""What paperwork? What leaving?""

Emilia's expression remained calm. ""A friend asked when I'd be discharged from the hospital. I said I'd handle the paperwork and leave once I'm better.""

The tension in Samuel's chest finally eased.

He held her hand tightly, his voice gentle and pleading.

""Emmie, haven't you always wanted to go to Hokkaido to see the snow? We'll go together this winter, okay?""

Emilia looked at the hope in his eyes, her throat tight and dry.

She longed to tell him that they wouldn't make it to this winter.

But in the end, she just forced a smile and said, ""Okay.""

As soon as the words left her mouth, tears streamed down her face. Samuel hurried to wipe them away, but the more he wiped, the more they fell.

He thought those were tears of emotion, never knowing that those tears from that day were her way of saying goodbye to him.

Three days later, Emilia was discharged from the hospital.

When she told Samuel the news, he said he was working overtime and couldn't leave.

But the next second, she saw Lyanna walking out of the obstetrics and gynecology department, holding her stomach.

And the person carefully supporting her was none other than that ""man who was working overtime.""

At the sight of this scene, Emilia's blood seemed to freeze in her veins.

The stabbing pain in her chest reminded her that Samuel had not only lied to her again but was also about to become a father.

And this child—along with the child's mother—had nothing to do with her at all.

***

After a long moment, she watched Samuel head for the payment window while Lyanna appeared beside her.

This time, there was no triumphant sneer in Lyanna's voice, only the plea of a mother.

""I'm pregnant.

""This child can't grow up without a father. Please... please let me have Samuel.""

When blood oozed from her bitten lip, Emilia tasted absurdity.

She had never imagined that the clichéd drama plot—""the other woman begs for the man's love with a pregnant belly""—would actually happen to her.

""Okay.""

Though the answer had long been decided, her heart still ached with tearing pain the moment the word left her mouth.

After speaking, just as she turned to leave, Lyanna suddenly grabbed her wrist and gave it a fierce yank.

""Ah!""

Amid the scream, Lyanna stumbled and fell to the ground.

Emilia remained frozen in place, still caught off guard, when Samuel came rushing over.

""Emilia Hutchinson!""

It was the first time he had shouted her full name. The rage in his eyes burned all ten years of their tender moments to ashes.

Lyanna clung to Samuel's pants and sobbed. ""Don't blame Ms. Hutchinson... It was me who made her unhappy.""

Emilia stared at Lyanna in disbelief, her lips trembling as she tried to explain.

""It wasn't me. It was her, she herself...""

A crisp slap landed sharply on her face before she could finish speaking.

What came into her sight was Samuel's cold, terrifying gaze.

""How could you even lay a hand on a pregnant woman, Emilia? When did you become so vicious?""


Chapter 6

After saying this, Samuel carefully helped Lyanna up from the ground.

He lifted Lyanna into his arms and turned to leave right in front of her.

From start to finish, he didn't spare her a single glance, as if he truly loathed her to the core.

Emilia held her burning cheek, the unfamiliar swelling under her fingertips feeling terrifying.

He had hit her.

For another woman, he had raised his hand against her for the first time.

He didn't even give her a chance to explain, and just like that, he assumed she did it.

In a daze, she thought of the man who would fret for ages if she nicked her finger while chopping vegetables.

The moment memories overlapped with reality, she finally had to admit that the Samuel who used to have eyes only for her was long gone, vanished in that fire ten years ago.

After that day, Samuel gave her the silent treatment.

He still came home on time like before, but he never brought her the fresh flowers from the shop downstairs anymore.

He still sat across from her at the dinner table, but he never said a single word to her again.

And Emilia just let this cold war fester, doing nothing to stop it.

She would be leaving soon anyway. For these last few days, it was fine to end things like this without any more entanglement.

Just when Emilia thought Samuel would keep acting like this forever, he suddenly came to her.

He told her that Lyanna was just a business associate, and accompanying her to the prenatal checkup was purely for work.

He said he'd lost control because he was so disappointed.

""The Emilia I remember couldn't even bear to step on an ant. But you...""

He didn't stop there; instead, he continued with the real reason he'd come to see her.

""The other thing I came to ask you for today is a favor.

""After Lyanna fell, the baby's heartbeat has been unstable.""

He avoided her gaze, his fingertips unconsciously brushing over his wedding ring.

""The psychic said... we need a lock of hair from the person who pushed her to make a protective charm for warding off bad energy.""

The air stilled for a moment.

Emilia looked at him quietly, suddenly feeling the absurdity of it all.

He could say something like that without even blinking.

""So what?"" she asked softly, her eyes cold as ice.

""So... could you cut your hair short...?""

After he said that, the excitement in his voice was impossible to hide.

""Lyanna is my business associate, and the baby in her belly is a living, breathing life. I can't just stand by and do nothing.

""But you, Emmie... no matter what you look like, I'll still love you.""

The man in front of her had the same features as always, yet he felt so unfamiliar that it made her heart ache.

She still remembered that Samuel had once said that her long hair was his favorite thing about her.

Because of his words, she had taken meticulous care of her hair all these years, never cutting it short again.

But now, he was actually asking her to cut her long hair for the child he had with another woman.

A single request turned all her years of careful hair care into a ridiculous farce of self-delusion.

She looked into the man's hopeful eyes and slowly took the scissors.

As the blades opened and closed, a lock of long hair fell silently to the ground.

The hair that was once praised by him as silk was now neatly severed, just like their ten-year marriage.

""Is this enough?

""If not, there's more.""

Her voice was as cold as permanently frozen polar ice, and the disappointment in her eyes was like a blade, making Samuel's heart twitch sharply.

He had never seen Emilia like this.

The eyes that had always been filled with tenderness were now so cold they made him panic.

The panic only lasted a moment before he forced it down.

After all, she didn't know anything about him and Lyanna.

She was just throwing a tantrum for a few days. She'd come around once he coaxed her.

Just like every other time in the past.

He bent down to pick up the cut hair from the floor, his tone as soft as when soothing a hissing cat.

""Emmie, no matter if your hair's long or short...

""You'll always be my Mrs. Elsham.""

He thought saying this would reassure her, but he had no idea that Emilia was already counting down the days until she left.

Only two days left.

In two days, this marriage that was on the edge of falling apart would come to a complete end.


Chapter 7

Over the remaining two days, Samuel told her he had to go on a work assignment out of town and wouldn't be back for a week.

Emilia knew he was going to be with Lyanna, but she said nothing—she just nodded faintly.

It was actually perfect. The divorce papers would be ready in these two days, and his absence would only make it easier for her to leave.

Sure enough, not long after Samuel left, messages from Lyanna started pouring in one after another.

Every single one was a brag.

She talked about how he stayed with her through the all-night prenatal checkup, how he personally made soup and brought it to her bedside, and how he'd stared at the ultrasound photo and smiled like an idiot all night.

Beneath the ultrasound photo attached at the end, there was also a line of words that stung like a needle.

""Didn't see that coming, Ms. Hutchinson? You couldn't give him a child all these years, but I'm carrying twins on my first try.""

Right after that, another message came.

""Sam said, if it's a boy, we'll name him Oliver Kirchman; if it's a girl, Sophie Kirchman.""

Emilia had been mindlessly swiping through the screen, but the second she saw those two names, her breath caught.

Memories came flooding back.

On their wedding night, Samuel had held her hand and talked about their future under the moonlight.

""If it's a boy, we'll name him Oliver—he'll protect you just like I do.

""If it's a girl... we'll call her Soph. She will be as innocent and bright as you are.""

His fingertips were warm, his eyes burning with passion, as if the vow he made in that moment would last a lifetime.

Yet now, those very same names were to be used for the child he had with another woman.

It turned out what he'd cherished was never a child with her, but anyone who could carry on his bloodline.

As for who the child's mother was...

It had never mattered.

***

The following morning, a call came in when she was packing her luggage.

It was from her high school classmates. Someone must have found out she was moving abroad.

They all said they wanted to throw a farewell party for her.

Emilia wanted to decline at first, but her classmates were so enthusiastic she had no choice but to agree.

After hanging up, she received a message from the Courthouse saying her divorce certificate was ready for collection.

As soon as she got the news, Emilia immediately took a taxi and went to the Courthouse.

An hour later, she successfully obtained two divorce certificates.

The moment she saw them, a huge sense of relief washed over her.

Finally—this marriage built on self-deception, filled with lies and betrayal, had come to a complete end.

She looked at the evening sunset and broke into a sincere smile.

Thinking of the class reunion that evening, Emilia put the divorce certificates into her bag and took a taxi to the party.

It wasn't until she pushed open the door that she realized Samuel was also there.

And sitting right beside Samuel was Lyanna.

At that moment, he was thoughtfully rinsing utensils for Lyanna, completely unaware of her presence.

It made sense, she thought—Samuel and she had gone to the same high school, so it was normal for him to attend the class reunion.

When everyone saw her staring at Samuel in a daze, they assumed she hadn't recognized him. They kindly pointed at Samuel and introduced him.

""Emmie, don't you remember? This is Samuel! He was your deskmate back then, and he always passed you little notes!""

After saying that, they smiled and pointed to Lyanna leaning against him.

""This is Lyanna, Samuel's girlfriend.""

""He's such a sweetheart to his girl. He told us earlier that he'll drink all the alcohol himself. He won't let his girlfriend touch a single drop.""

Upon hearing this, Emilia tugged at the corner of her lips in self-mockery.

""Yeah, he's definitely sweet to her.""

When Samuel heard Emilia's voice, he looked up abruptly. The second their eyes met, his blood seemed to freeze.

His expression turned stiff instantly, a flicker of panic crossing his eyes. He subconsciously moved to stand up.

But Emilia had already sat down calmly, not sparing him even a glance.

Her phone vibrated in her palm.

The screen lit up, filled with Samuel's urgent excuses.

""Emmie, they're just messing around.

""I only brought Lyanna because of work. We were just heading the same way.

""I only got the notice that my business trip was over this morning, and I just landed at the airport tonight.

""It's true. You have to believe me.""

Staring at the lies Samuel spouted so effortlessly, Emilia suddenly felt numb.

She'd lost count of how many lies he'd told her by now.

They say the most important thing in a marriage is honesty, yet their marriage had been built on lies from the very start.

She replied faintly. ""Okay, I got it.""

After replying, she went on chatting with her former high school classmates, paying no more attention to Samuel's messages.

As the drinks flowed round after round, everyone at the table had flushed cheeks from being drunk.

Pamela Kirke, her closest friend from high school who'd also been the class monitor, suddenly stood up unsteadily. When she looked at Emilia, her eyes were already red.

""Emmie, back in high school, you and I were the closest. Even though we lost touch after graduation, in my heart, I've always hoped you'd have a better life than anyone else.""

At this point, her voice caught slightly with emotion.

""So when I heard you're moving abroad, I was truly happy for you. A talented girl like you deserves to fly to farther places.

""Emmie, on behalf of all our classmates, I want to wish you all the best and a brilliant future!""

As her words fell, applause erupted around the table, rising and falling in waves.

Only Samuel remained motionless, as if nailed to the spot, his eyes filled with shock and fear.

""Moving abroad? What do you mean, moving abroad? I don't understand!""

Pamela looked at him in surprise. ""You didn't know? Emmie is going abroad soon. This gathering tonight is a farewell for her... Haven't you checked the group messages?""

At that moment, Emilia took the wine glass from Pamela's hand and downed it in one gulp.

Then she refilled it and held it high. Her voice was clear and bright.

""Everyone, apart from moving abroad, I have another piece of happy news to announce.

""I'm getting married! The wedding will be held abroad, and I'll cover all flights and accommodation. Everyone is welcome to come!""

# 🌤 Weather: Less Rain, More Life

If you’ve ever lived in Taipei during rainy season, you know the feeling: grey, humid, umbrella permanently attached to your hand.

Taichung’s big advantage:

* **Less rain, more sunshine** — the climate is noticeably drier than Taipei
* Winters are **mild and comfortable**
* You get more “just go outside and walk” days
* Great for people who like to explore on foot or by bike

If you’re sensitive to gloomy weather, this alone can be a game-changer.

# 💰 Cost of Living vs Taipei

Rough ballpark for a solo nomad (USD, per month):

* 🏠 **Rent (studio / 1BR):** \~ **$450–$800**
* 🍜 **Food (mix of local + cafés):** **$250–$400**
* 🚇 **Transport (bus, train, scooter share):** **$25–$50**
* 💻 **Coworking / cafés budget:** **$80–$150**

Overall, you can live *comfortably* in Taichung on **$1,100–$1,700 / month**, depending on your standards. That’s usually **a few hundred cheaper than Taipei** for similar comfort.

# 🧠 Vibe: Creative, Local, Less Intense

Taichung feels like a mix of:

* **Student city** (lots of universities & art schools)
* **Creative hub** (street art, design cafés, indie shops)
* **Relaxed mid-sized city** instead of a hyper capital

If Taipei is “efficient, global capital”, Taichung is more:

>

You still get modern malls, bubble tea temples, and all the Taiwanese essentials – just with slightly softer edges.

# ☕ Cafés & Coworking in Taichung

Taichung is quietly amazing for **laptop life**.

# ☕ Laptop-friendly café culture

You’ll find:

* Minimalist third-wave coffee shops
* Artsy spots with plants, vinyl, and soft lighting
* Brunch cafés with Wi-Fi and outlets at almost every table

Typical pattern: order 1–2 drinks or a meal and you can easily work a few hours without weird looks.

# 💻 Coworking spaces

The scene isn’t as dense as Taipei, but you’ll still find:

* Community-driven coworking hubs
* Spaces near the main station or Calligraphy Greenway
* Places offering day passes, hot desks, and meeting rooms

If you like a mix of **2–3 coworking days + café days**, Taichung works really well.

# 📍 Best Areas to Stay for Digital Nomads

# 1. West District (西區)

Probably the most popular choice for nomads.

* Near **Calligraphy Greenway** (artsy, walkable area)
* Tons of cafés, boutiques, and small restaurants
* Central enough without being chaotic

# 2. North District (北區)

More local, still convenient.

* Close to universities
* Slightly cheaper rent
* Good for longer stays on a budget

# 3. Around Taichung Station

* Great if you travel a lot by train
* Mix of older buildings + new developments
* Easier access to other cities (Taipei, Kaohsiung, etc.)

# 🚶‍♀️ Lifestyle: What Do You Actually Do Here?

Outside work, life in Taichung can look like:

* Morning: work in a café near Calligraphy Greenway
* Afternoon: quick break in a park or riverside area
* Evening: **Fengjia Night Market** or smaller local food streets
* Weekend: short trips to **Sun Moon Lake**, mountains, or hot springs

Taichung sits in the middle of the island, so it’s a great base for exploring **central Taiwan** without living in a tiny mountain town.

# 🚦 Transport & Getting Around

This is one of Taichung’s few “not-perfect” points.

* There’s **no full metro system** yet (a light rail line exists but limited)
* You’ll rely mostly on:
   * 🚌 buses (cheap, often free for short rides with a card)
   * 🛵 scooters or scooter-sharing (if you’re comfortable with that)
   * 🚕 taxis / Uber for convenience

If you *must* have a slick MRT like Taipei or Seoul, you might find this annoying. If you’re okay with buses + some walking/scooters, it’s manageable.

# ✅ Pros & ❌ Cons for Digital Nomads

**Pros:**

* 🌤 Better weather and fewer gloomy days than Taipei
* 💸 Cheaper rent and daily costs
* 🎨 Creative, slightly artsy vibe
* ☕ Strong café culture = easy laptop work days
* 📍 Good central base for exploring Taiwan

**Cons:**

* 🚇 Public transport less “frictionless” than Taipei
* 💼 Fewer international coworking brands & events
* 🌍 Smaller expat/nomad community (for now)
* 🏙 Less “big city buzz” if you crave that energy

# Who Will Love Taichung as a Digital Nomad?

Taichung is probably for you if:

* You want **Taiwan level quality of life** without Taipei prices
* Weather affects your mood and you’d like more sunshine
* You prefer **creative mid-sized cities** over megacities
* Your work is flexible (you don’t need constant networking events)

You might prefer Taipei if:

* You need **maximal public transport convenience**
* You want the largest possible coworking & expat ecosystem
* You love big-city intensity and skyscraper nightlife

# TL;DR

>

Not as famous as Taipei, not as intense as big capitals, but for a lot of remote workers it hits that sweet spot of:

* comfortable
* affordable
* inspiring enough to stay productive
* and relaxed enough to actually enjoy your life 🌤

If you’ve been thinking about Taiwan and don’t want to spend your whole stay under Taipei’s rain clouds… put **Taichung** on your list.

But when it comes to sweetening these beloved beverages, the debate rages on: sugar or something better? Enter coffee, tea, and** [**artificial sweeteners**](https://beautykabir.com/sugar-free-sweets-are-they-really-safe/)**—a dynamic trio that’s revolutionizing how we enjoy our daily doses of caffeine without the caloric crash. Whether you’re a black coffee purist, a green tea enthusiast, or someone experimenting with low-sugar lattes, understanding the interplay between coffee, tea, and artificial sweeteners can unlock a world of health benefits, flavor innovations, and mindful indulgence.**

**This comprehensive guide dives deep into the world of coffee, tea, and artificial sweeteners, exploring their individual perks, synergistic effects, and practical applications. We’ll uncover how artificial sweeteners can enhance the natural goodness of coffee and tea, helping you cut calories while amplifying antioxidants and wellness. From reducing the risk of chronic diseases to crafting delicious recipes, coffee, tea, and artificial sweeteners offer a balanced path to better health. Backed by science and real-life insights, this article equips you with everything you need to make informed choices. Let’s brew up some knowledge!**

# Understanding Artificial Sweeteners: The Sweet Side of Zero Calories

**Artificial sweeteners have come a long way since their introduction in the 20th century, evolving from simple sugar substitutes to sophisticated options that mimic sweetness without the spike in blood sugar. At their core, artificial sweeteners are low- or no-calorie compounds designed to provide the taste of sugar—sucrose—while dodging its metabolic downsides. This makes them ideal companions for coffee, tea, and artificial sweetener routines, especially for those managing weight, diabetes, or simply seeking guilt-free pleasure.**

**There are two main categories: synthetic (artificial) and natural-derived. Synthetic ones include aspartame (found in Equal and NutraSweet), sucralose (Splenda), and saccharin (Sweet’N Low). Aspartame, for instance, is 200 times sweeter than sugar and breaks down into amino acids during digestion, making it suitable for hot beverages like coffee, where heat stability isn’t a massive concern. Sucralose stands out for its heat resistance, perfect for baked goods or hot tea, as it remains stable up to 350°F. Saccharin, the oldest artificial sweetener (discovered in 1879), offers a slightly bitter aftertaste but packs 300-400 times the sweetness of sugar.**

**On the natural side, stevia (from the Stevia rebaudiana plant) and monk fruit extract provide plant-based alternatives that are 200-300 times sweeter than sugar with zero calories. Erythritol, a sugar alcohol, ferments naturally in fruits and adds a cooling sensation, making it a favorite for iced coffee or chilled teas. These options align seamlessly with coffee, tea, and artificial sweetener pairings, as they dissolve easily and don’t alter the beverage’s pH or flavor profile dramatically.**

**How do they work? Artificial sweeteners bind to sweet taste receptors on the tongue, tricking the brain into perceiving sweetness without triggering insulin release. This is a game-changer for coffee, tea, and artificial sweetener enthusiasts aiming to lower glycemic impact. Studies show that swapping sugar for these alternatives can reduce daily calorie intake by up to 200-300 calories, aiding weight management. However, not all are created equal—some, like aspartame, degrade in high heat, so opt for sucralose in piping-hot espresso.** 

**When choosing coffee, tea, and artificial sweeteners, consider your needs: diabetics might prefer stevia for its non-glycemic nature, while athletes could lean on erythritol for its minimal digestive disruption. Always check labels, as blends (e.g., Truvia with stevia and erythritol) offer balanced taste. In essence, artificial sweeteners empower you to savor coffee, tea, and artificial sweeteners’ harmony without compromise, blending science with sensory delight.**

# The Power of Coffee: Health Benefits and How Sweeteners Enhance It

**Coffee isn’t just a morning ritual—it’s a powerhouse of bioactive compounds that can supercharge your health. Brewed from roasted Coffea beans, this elixir delivers caffeine, chlorogenic acids, and polyphenols that combat oxidative stress. Regular coffee consumption, say 3-4 cups daily, is linked to a 20-30% lower risk of type 2 diabetes, thanks to improved insulin sensitivity. It also slashes the odds of Parkinson’s disease by up to 25%, as caffeine blocks adenosine receptors, protecting dopamine-producing neurons.**

**Heart health gets a boost too: antioxidants in coffee reduce inflammation, lowering cardiovascular disease risk by 15-20%. A 2025 study even found that pre-noon coffee drinkers see greater reductions in early mortality from heart issues. Liver lovers rejoice—coffee halves the risk of cirrhosis and fatty liver disease. And for mental sharpness? Coffee enhances focus and mood via dopamine and serotonin modulation.**

**Now, enter artificial sweeteners: they elevate coffee’s profile by making it accessible without sugar’s 16 calories per teaspoon. Imagine a zero-calorie vanilla latte sweetened with sucralose—same creamy delight, minus the crash. This synergy in coffee, tea, and artificial sweeteners shines for weight control; a study showed sweetener-sweetened coffee users maintained 5-10% more weight loss than sugar users.**

**Practical tips: For black coffee purists, a dash of stevia highlights coffee’s nutty notes without overpowering. In cold brews, erythritol’s cool finish pairs with citrus twists. Heat-stable options like sucralose work wonders in French press pots, preserving coffee’s robust antioxidants. Coffee, tea, and artificial sweeteners together democratize these benefits, allowing calorie-conscious folks to reap rewards like reduced obesity risk (coffee drinkers are 10% less likely to gain weight).**

**Cautions? Overdo caffeine (over 400mg/day), and jitters ensue, but sweeteners don’t exacerbate this. In coffee, tea, and artificial sweetener combos, moderation ensures you harness coffee’s longevity perks—up to 10-15% lower all-cause mortality. Whether drip, pour-over, or espresso, coffee sweetened smartly is your ally for vitality.**

# Tea’s Timeless Treasures: Benefits and Sweetening Smartly

**Tea, derived from Camellia sinensis leaves (or herbal infusions), has been a wellness staple for millennia. Green, black, oolong, or white—each variety brims with catechins, theaflavins, and L-theanine for a calm alertness. Drinking 3+ cups daily correlates with 20-30% lower stroke risk, as flavonoids improve vascular function. Green tea’s EGCG shines in cancer prevention, reducing lung and colon risks by up to 30% in high consumers.**

**Heart health? Tea drinkers enjoy 10-15% fewer cardiac events, thanks to lowered LDL cholesterol. For weight management, tea boosts metabolism by 4-5%, burning an extra 70 calories daily. Brain benefits include reduced dementia risk via anti-inflammatory effects, and black tea stabilizes blood sugar, aiding diabetes control. Herbal teas like chamomile soothe digestion and promote sleep, lowering chronic disease odds.**

**Artificial sweeteners transform tea from bitter to blissful, especially in iced varieties where sugar overloads calories. Monk fruit’s fruity undertone enhances herbal teas, while aspartame suits hot blacks without altering tannins. In coffee, tea, and artificial sweetener dynamics, this pairing supports low-sugar lifestyles—sweetener-infused teas help maintain weight loss by curbing cravings.**

**Experiment: Stevia in matcha amplifies umami without bitterness; sucralose in chai lattes preserves spice harmony. For sun teas, xylitol adds subtle mintiness. Coffee, tea, and artificial sweeteners unite to deliver tea’s full spectrum—from oral health (reduced decay risk) to skin glow via antioxidants. With less caffeine than coffee (30-50mg/cup), tea sweetened wisely fosters sustained energy sans jitters.**

# Combining Coffee, Tea, and Artificial Sweeteners: Recipes and Tips

**The magic of coffee, tea, and artificial sweeteners lies in their versatility—endless recipes await. Start simple: A classic Americano sweetened with one packet of stevia (0 calories) retains coffee’s bold essence while curbing sugar urges.**

**For tea lovers, try Cold Brewed Iced Tea: Steep 4 black tea bags in 8 cups of cold water overnight, add Splenda Stevia Sweetener to taste (about 1/2 cup equivalent), and garnish with lemon. Zero calories, endless refreshment—perfect for summer hydration. Read On** [**beautykabir.com**](http://beautykabir.com)",1,1764297007.0,u_United_Price4291,0,1.0,False

I am incredibly lucky to be able to work from home and to do so with little to no supervision.
So I volunteered to work the day shift today to get that sweet overtime and have a little extra for the holidays. 

But I wanted a nice dinner as well.

At 7am I was up, woke up my adult daughter to get her to work at 9 so she could work her shift until 5pm today, came home, grabbed a shower, and until just now, I have been nonstop. 

Making it to the table tonight was a 23-pound turkey (I ordered a 9, they messed up), made-from-scratch mac and cheese, handmade whipped potatoes, fresh roasted green beans, sweet peas, dinner rolls, 60 deviled eggs, and both a scratch-made pumpkin pie and sweet potato pie. 

I moved back and forth between my desk and the kitchen, setting timers and mixing where needed. I looked like a madman, I am sure. 

By the time 5pm rolls around, I have the veggies staying warm, the turkey already parted into its major components and dropped in a water bath to hold at 150 degrees, potatoes in the crock pot to hold warming, and the mac and cheese coming up to temp and getting a perfect crust when my daughter calls and is ready for pickup, run out and get her (after shutting off all the appliances, of course) and am back home in less than 10 minutes since there was zero traffic. 

Make it back home, turn on the broiler to get a perfect bubbly crust on the mac and cheese, daughter helps mix the deviled eggs, we pipe them into the shells, pull the mac and cheese, put in the dinner rolls to warm up, and set the table. We are eating by 6pm. 

All of my tickets at work are done, I have helped out my coworkers with miscellaneous questions they had, and I have had my Slack open and ready for any emergency all day. 

Dinner is served, and the table falls silent as I sit back and see my family absolutely devouring the food I busted my ass for.

Plates are cleared, dessert is served, and we are all stuffed. 

I excuse myself to blow up the bathroom and come back out a few minutes later to all the kids cooperating and clearing the table and putting away the leftovers...

Not a single fight, just laughter and enjoyment and some whipped cream being shot into each other's faces. 

I now sit here, exhausted, sore, and with way too much food in me, with a coffee and a slice of pie staring at me, knowing it stands no chance...

My kids are grateful, no doubt, but they have no idea what I went through today, and I would not dream of burdening them with that knowledge either or asking them for sympathy. 

I just wanted someone to know, to see it, to understand it. 

Thank you. 

And Happy Thanksgiving to all.",122,1764296987.0,daddit,15,0.99,False

I’ve been battling brainfog for 6 years, it’s better now because I take cromolyn sodium and Allegra every day (I stopped taking Pepcid since it didn’t noticeably help). However, I still get brain fog every day (worst in the morning when I get out of bed, and it really gets worse after coffee or bread or high histamine foods). My symptoms are brain fog, itchy tongue, itchy hands, mood swings, light headed, lots of phlegm in the throat, bags under my eyes, sensitivity to temperature changes, etc. but the worst is brain fog. These are all mediated with the aforementioned medications, but the fog remains.


Tips on what I can do to relieve brain fog? Salt water helps, lemonade helps (been drinking this every morning), massages help (especially my neck), and doing my work at night instead of the morning since my fog is ok at nighttime.

So I really understand the importance of vetting someone before meeting in person.

But this situation has me unsure.

I matched with a guy on a matchmaking site. It gives you a decent amount of basic info about the other person, so I already knew a bit about him. He lives about 45 minutes away, which isn’t bad for my city. 

We texted a little, and then he asked to have a phone call. I said yes. We talked for about 1.5 hours. Honestly, it was a good conversation. He sounded a bit nervous, but the call flowed.

So naturally, I expected that after a call like that, he’d want to set up a date. But instead he texted asking if I’d be free to have **another phone call** this weekend.

For more background context: I used to be someone who would talk to guys for *weeks* before meeting. Over time, I have learned that this is usually a waste of time, like it often turns into pen-pal dynamics, or guys seeking emotional companionship rather than a real date. I’m done with that!!!!!! I want to actually meet in person and see if there’s real chemistry.

And honestly, that 1.5-hour phone call *could’ve been* a first date. So now he wants another hour long phone call? I’d rather spend that hour actually meeting in person than having another phone call.

So my question is: Is it weird that he wants another phone call instead of asking to meet for a coffee or something? Is this a sign he doesn’t actually want to meet, or am I overthinking it?

Would love to hear how others would interpret this. I'm just really not trying to waste my time. ",8,1764296785.0,WhatShouldIDo,25,0.83,False

1p8jc7q,https://i.redd.it/kecee9mxqw3g1.jpeg,Ice cream + peanut butter “milkshake”,"This is equal parts cookie dough and cookies and cream + about 2 tablespoons of peanut butter. My advice would be to add PB slowly until you reach your desired consistency. Whip” it up in a bowl until it’s like a thick milkshake. Chef’s kiss 👌🏻

Could work with any ice cream flavor really! Fruity flavors give a pb&j vibe, chocolatey, coffee or cheesecake flavors would be a good complement to PB imo. Mint chocolate chip is the only one I can think of that wouldn’t work.",6,1764296373.0,stonerfood,1,1.0,False
