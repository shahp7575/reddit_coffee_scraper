2. Binders are weird and come in weird sizes. I‚Äôd like it to be obvious that it‚Äôs a photo binder, so I think having a little window in the front would be good. Or maybe just a transparent binder. Or maybe a binder with no cover, just the rings. 
3. Photo sizes are tough. I feel like A4 makes so much more sense than letter because the aspect ratio is closer. But all the binders I‚Äôm finding seem like they‚Äôre meant for letter paper. And very few photo printing services will do A4, it seems.",1,1759983113.0,photography,0,1.0,False

1o1wd64,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1o1wd64/the_heartbreak_prescription/,The Heartbreak Prescription,"One night, Stanley received the divorce papers from Wendy. Her reason for wanting to get a divorce was due to his failing potency. Seeing him approach, Wendy smiled gracefully and asked, ‚ÄúStanley, are you here for an andrology consultation?‚Äù

One day, Wendy discovered that her husband Stanley was having an affair.

He had been seeing a college student.

It was Stanley's birthday. Wendy had prepared a table full of dishes early in the day. Just then, she heard a notification from his phone.

Ding!

He had left his phone at home.

Wendy switched it on and saw a text from the college student.

\[I hurt myself when I was carrying the cake. It hurts so much.\]

Attached was a selfie‚Äînot of the sender's face, but of her legs. The girl in the photo wore pulled-up white socks, black leather shoes, and a blue-and-white skirt that had been pushed up to reveal her long, slender legs. Her pale knees were visibly reddened from the bump. The youthful, vibrant image of her body paired with coquettish words exuded a forbidden allure.

People often say successful businessmen like Stanley favored this type of woman when choosing mistresses.

Wendy clutched the phone tightly, her fingers turning white from the pressure.

Ding!

Another text came from the college student.

""Mr. Hawk, see you at Cloud Hotel tonight. I want to celebrate your birthday!""

So, his mistress wanted to celebrate his birthday tonight.

Wendy grabbed her bag and headed straight to Cloud Hotel. She had to see for herself who this college student was.

She soon arrived at the hotel, ready to go in. Just then, she saw her parents, Harry and Lilian at the entrance. Surprised, she walked up to them.

""Dad, Mom, what are you doing here?"" she asked.

Harry and Lilian, caught off guard, exchanged a glance before responding to her hesitantly.

""Wendy, your sister's back in the country. We brought her here,"" Harry said.

'Jessica?'

Through the hotel's gleaming floor-to-ceiling windows, Wendy spotted her sister Jessica and immediately froze.

Jessica was wearing the exact same blue-and-white skirt from the photo in Stanley's phone. The college student was none other than her own sister!

Jessica had always been a beauty, known as the 'Red Rose of Hovendale,' and she was famed for having the most beautiful legs in town. Many men had been captivated by her charm. And now, her darling sister was using those legs to seduce her husband.

Wendy found it laughable. She turned to her parents and said coldly, ""So I'm the last to know?""

Harry gave a sheepish smile. ""Wendy, Mr. Hawk doesn't even like you.""

""Exactly, Wendy,"" Lilian chimed in. ""Do you know how many women in Hovendale are dying to be with Mr. Hawk? Better to let Jessica have him than some other woman.""

Wendy clenched her fists. ""Dad, Mom, I'm your daughter too!""

Turning on her heel, she started walking away.

Lilian called after her. ""Wendy, tell me‚Äîhas Mr. Hawk ever touched you?""

Wendy stopped in her tracks.

Harry's voice turned sharp. ""Wendy, don't act like we owe you anything. Three years ago, when Stanley and Jessica were Hovendale's golden couple, everyone thought they'd get married. But then Stanley got into a car accident and went into a coma. That's the only reason we had you marry him instead.""

Lilian gave Wendy a disdainful once-over. ""Look at yourself, Wendy. In the past three years, you've turned into a housewife who revolves around her husband. Meanwhile, Jessica became the principal ballerina of her company. She's a white swan, and you're just an ugly duckling. What do you have to compete with Jessica? Just give Mr. Hawk back to her already.""

Every word felt like a knife into Wendy's chest. Tears filling her eyes, she walked away.

\-

Back at the villa, night had fallen. Wendy had sent the maid Mathilda home, so the house was empty, dark, and cold.

She sat alone at the dining table.

The once-warm meal had gone cold. The cake she had carefully prepared had 'Happy Birthday, Honey' written on it in frosting.

It was glaringly ironic, just like her existence‚Äîa complete joke.

Stanley and Jessica had been the golden couple of Hovendale, with Jessica as Stanley's cherished 'Red Rose.' But three years ago, a sudden car accident left Stanley in a vegetative state and Jessica disappeared entirely.

That was when the Crone family brought Wendy back from the countryside and forced her to marry Stanley in Jessica's place. Wendy had agreed willingly when she found out it was Stanley‚Äîthe man she had loved all along.

For three years, Stanley remained in a coma. During those years, Wendy devoted herself to caring for him. She stayed by his side, gave up socializing, and focused solely on nursing him back to health, living as a dutiful housewife. In the end, her efforts paid off. Stanley woke up.

Wendy lit the candles on the cake.

The flickering glow illuminated her reflection in the nearby mirror‚Äîa plain housewife in a dull black-and-white dress, devoid of charm or excitement.

Meanwhile, Jessica, now a successful ballerina, was young, vibrant, and beautiful.

Wendy was an ugly duckling, while Jessica was the white swan.

After waking up, Stanley abandoned the ugly duckling and returned to the white swan's side.

Wendy let out a bitter laugh.

This wasn't love; it was self-delusion. Stanley had never loved her, but she had loved him. The first one to fall in love always lost.

Today, Stanley had made her lose completely.

Tears welled in her eyes as she blew out the candles, plunging the villa back into darkness.

Just then, two bright headlights pierced through the night. Stanley's car sped up the driveway and came to a halt on the lawn.

Wendy's eyelashes quivered. He had come back. She had thought he wouldn't return tonight.

The villa door opened and Stanley stepped in, carrying the cool air of the night with him.

Stanley Hawk, the heir of the Hawk family, had been a business prodigy from a very young age. By 16, he had earned dual master's degrees from Harfield. Later, he took Hawk Group public in Hawthorne, making a name for himself internationally before returning home to lead the company as Hovendale's wealthiest man.

Stanley walked in.

""Why didn't you turn on the lights?"" he asked in a deep, magnetic voice as he turned on the wall lamp with a click.

The sudden brightness made Wendy blink. When her eyes adjusted, she looked at him.

Dressed in a custom-tailored black suit, Stanley exuded a cold, aristocratic elegance that left countless socialites dreaming of him at night.

""It's your birthday,"" she said.

Stanley's handsome face remained indifferent as his gaze swept lazily over the dining table. ""Don't waste your time on this again. I don't celebrate such occasions.""

Wendy smiled faintly. ""Is it that you don't celebrate, or you just don't want to celebrate with me?""

Stanley glanced at her, his gaze impassive. ""Think what you like.""

With that, he turned around and started up the stairs.

He had always been like this‚Äîdistant and cold. No matter what she did, she could never warm his heart.

Wendy stood and called after him. ""It's your birthday today. I have a gift for you.""

However, Stanley didn't stop or turn around. ""I don't need it.""

Wendy let out a soft chuckle and said, ""Stanley, let's get a divorce.""

Stanley froze mid-step, one foot already on the staircase. He turned around, his deep black eyes locking onto her.

**Chapter 2**

Wendy was also staring at him. Her tone was light but firm as she repeated, ""Let's get a divorce, Stanley. Do you like your birthday gift?""

Stanley didn't bat an eyelid. ""You're asking for a divorce just because I didn't celebrate my birthday with you?""

""Jessica has returned, hasn't she?""

At the mention of Jessica, Stanley's thin lips curled into a faint, mocking smile. He took a step forward, closing the distance between them. ""Are you bothered by Jessica?""

Stanley, known as the youngest business prodigy alive, exuded an aura of power, wealth, and status. As he approached, Wendy instinctively stepped back, her slender back pressing against the cold wall.

Her vision went dark as Stanley leaned in. He propped one hand against the wall beside her, trapping her between his firm chest and the wall.

Looking down at her with his deep, striking eyes, Stanley sneered.

""Everyone in Hovendale knows Jessica was the one I intended to marry. Weren't you aware when you schemed to replace her and became Mrs. Hawk? You didn‚Äôt mind then, so why act all self-righteous now?""

Wendy's face turned pale.

Yes, Stanley had wanted to marry Jessica. If not for the accident that left him in a coma, how could Wendy have married him?

She would never forget the day he woke up. The disappointment and coldness in his eyes when he saw her was devastating.

Since then, they had lived in separate rooms. He never touched her.

He loved Jessica.

Wendy had always known this, but...

She gazed deeply at Stanley's face, the grown man overlapping in her mind with the young boy from years ago.

'Stanley, do you really not remember me?'

It turned out she had been standing in place all along, waiting for someone that no longer existed.

It was enough.

These three years were just her one-sided effort to cherish him.

Suppressing the ache in her heart, Wendy said softly, ""Stanley, let's end this loveless marriage.""

Stanley's brows arched sharply, and his deep, magnetic voice could be heard. ""Loveless?""

He raised his hand, gripping her delicate chin, his thumb brushing against her crimson lips in a provocative motion. ""Is that why? Are you asking for a divorce because of that? Do you want it that badly?""

Wendy's delicate face flushed red like a ripe berry, vibrant and tempting.

That wasn‚Äôt what she meant!

Yet his thumb lingered on her lips, pressing and toying with them. She hadn't expected such a composed and distinguished man to have such a teasing, roguish side.

Stanley was seeing Wendy up close for the first time. She usually dressed in monotonous black-and-white outfits, paired with oversized black-framed glasses, presenting herself like an old maid.

But up close, he realized her face was barely the size of his palm, and her delicate features exuded a quiet elegance beneath those glasses. Her dark pupils were stunningly beautiful.

Her lips were soft, their plush surface springing back with a subtle elasticity wherever his thumb pressed.

It stirred an unbidden thought.

Stanley‚Äôs gaze darkened. ""I didn‚Äôt expect you to be so eager. You‚Äôre that desperate for a man, aren‚Äôt you?""

Slap!

Wendy raised her hand and slapped him across the face. Stanley‚Äôs handsome face tilted to the side from the impact.

Wendy‚Äôs fingers trembled with anger. She realized that loving someone too humbly only led to her dignity being trampled on. He had actually humiliated her.

Furious, she declared, ""I know you‚Äôve never stopped thinking about Jessica. Fine, I‚Äôll fulfill your wishes and return Mrs. Hawk‚Äôs title to her!""

Stanley‚Äôs face instantly darkened, frosty and sullen. A man of his stature had never been slapped before‚Äînever!

His sharp gaze locked onto her. ""Wendy, you married me when it was convenient for you, and now you want a divorce just because you feel like it. What do you take me for?""

Wendy let out a soft chuckle. ""A plaything.""

""What?""

Stanley‚Äôs expression stiffened.

Wendy forced herself to endure the pain in her heart and said what she knew would hurt him. ""You‚Äôre just a toy I took from Jessica. I‚Äôm done playing, so I‚Äôm tossing you aside.""

Stanley‚Äôs expression turned grim, his mood darkening to the point where it could drip with venom. ""Fine! Wendy, you‚Äôre something else. Let‚Äôs divorce, but don‚Äôt come crying back to me, begging for reconciliation!""

He stormed upstairs, slamming the study door shut with a deafening bang.

Wendy felt as though all the strength had been drained from her body. Slowly, she slid down the wall, crouching on the carpet. Hugging her knees, she whispered to herself, 'Stanley, I won‚Äôt love you anymore.'

\-

The next morning, Mathilda entered the study.

Stanley was seated at his desk, reviewing documents. He was a notorious workaholic.

""Sir,"" Mathilda greeted Stanley cautiously.

Stanley didn‚Äôt even look up. His icy aura hinted at his foul mood. It felt cold being around him.

Mathilda carefully placed a cup of coffee by his hand. ""Sir, this coffee was made by Mrs. Hawk.""

Stanley‚Äôs pen paused mid-air, his cold expression softening slightly.

Was she trying to make amends?

Truth be told, Wendy was an excellent wife. She cooked to his preferences, hand-washed his clothes, and meticulously managed his daily needs.

Stanley picked up the coffee, taking a sip. It was her coffee‚Äîthe taste he liked.

But he was still angry.

She had slapped him last night, and he wasn‚Äôt about to let that go easily. A single cup of coffee wouldn‚Äôt suffice as an apology.

""Did she admit she was wrong?"" Stanley asked.

Mathilda glanced at him hesitantly. ""Sir, Mrs. Hawk has left.""

Stanley froze, looking up at Mathilda.

She handed him a piece of paper. ""Sir, Mrs. Hawk left this with her suitcase and asked me to give this to you before she left.""

Stanley unfolded the paper. The words 'Divorce Agreement' caught his eye.

His expression darkened. He thought she was trying to reconcile.

Mathilda added cautiously, ""Sir, Mrs. Hawk asked you to finish the coffee before signing the divorce papers.""

Stanley glared at the coffee. ""Throw it out! All of it!""

'Sir, you seemed to like the coffee just fine a moment ago. Why don't you anymore?' Mathilda thought to herself.

Without saying another word, she quickly left with the coffee.

Stanley‚Äôs face was a thunderstorm, his mood in turmoil. He skimmed through the divorce agreement. She wasn‚Äôt asking for a penny‚Äîshe intended to leave with nothing.

Stanley scoffed coldly. It was bold of her to act like she didn‚Äôt need his money. How would a country girl like her survive without it?

It was then that his gaze landed on the reason for divorce, handwritten by Wendy herself.

""Due to my husband‚Äôs physical dysfunction, he cannot fulfill his marital obligations.""

Stanley froze, his handsome face turning completely dark.

'That woman!'

He grabbed his phone and dialed Wendy‚Äôs number.

The line connected, and Wendy‚Äôs voice came through clearly. ""Hello?""

**Chapter 3**

Stanley's thin lips curved into a frosty arc. ""Wendy, get back here immediately!""

Wendy chuckled. ""You expect me to come back just because you said so? We're divorced, Stanley. I'm not going to continue indulging you!""

Stanley clenched his jaw. ""I'll give you a chance to rewrite the reason for divorce!""

Wendy's tone grew more playful.

""Did I write anything wrong? Stanley, it's been six months since you woke up, hasn't it? Yet, in these six months, you haven't even held my hand. You were in a coma for three years, and although you're physically healthy now, I have legitimate reasons to believe you've developed functional problems. You're not potent anymore! Better hurry to find an experienced naturopath. As our parting gift, I wish you an early recovery of your manhood!""

Stanley was rendered speechless. The veins on his forehead were visibly twitching.

This woman was out of control.

""Wendy, I'll make you regret this! You'll know what I'm capable of sooner or later!""

""Sorry, but you'll never get the chance!""

""Wendy!""

The call abruptly ended with two cold beeps. He hadn't even had time to explode in anger before hearing the disconnected tone.

'Wendy‚Ä¶!'

\-

Wendy had already arrived at her best friend Cecelia Sunder's apartment. After she hung up the phone, Cecelia burst out laughing and gave her a big thumbs-up.

""Wendy, that was amazing! Stanley must be so furious, he's spitting blood right now.""

Wendy reflected that she had been too humble in the past, which had allowed him to act superior to her for so long.

'Love yourself first. A woman must always prioritize self-love.'

""Three years ago, when Jessica learned Stanley went into a coma after the car accident, she immediately ran away. Now that he's awake, he's crawling back to her? What a joke! You're better off without a man like that,"" Cecelia commented.

Wendy unwrapped a candy and popped it into her mouth. The sweetness seemed to mask the bitterness in her heart. ""That's how you tell if you're loved or not, Cecelia.""

Those who were loved were fearless. Those who weren't lived in constant insecurity.

Cecelia noticed Wendy had already gone through a pile of candies. She pulled Wendy to her feet.

""Wendy, cheer up! When you give up one tree, you'll discover an entire forest waiting for you. Tonight, I'm booking eight male hosts to celebrate you becoming single!""

Wendy covered her forehead and laughed.

Cecelia suddenly snatched Wendy's black-rimmed glasses off her face, tossing them into the trash.

Wendy tried to retrieve them. ""My glasses‚Äî""

Cecelia stopped her. ""Wendy, you've been in academic research for too long, and you've gotten used to wearing these glasses. But you should take a page out of Jessica's book and doll yourself up.""

Wendy thought about how her parents had always told her she was an ugly duckling while Jessica was a swan. It wasn't just her parents‚ÄîStanley must have thought the same. In his eyes, she was just an ugly duckling too.

Cecelia dragged Wendy to the door. ""Come on, we're going shopping! Hair, nails, clothes‚Äîeverything! I want Stanley and everyone else to see how stunning you can be!""

As they walked out, Cecelia suddenly remembered something. ""Oh, Wendy, are you really not taking any money from Stanley after the divorce?""

""I have my own money,"" Wendy replied.

""Letting Jessica spend Stanley's money instead? Jessica says thank you!"" Cecelia teased.

Wendy didn't know what to say to that.

""What about the card Stanley gave you?"" Cecelia pressed.

Stanley was always generous and had given Wendy a premium black card. However, she had never used it.

Wendy pulled the black card out of her purse and winked playfully. ""Today, I'll splurge‚Äîand let Stanley foot the bill.""

\-

That evening, at 1996 Bar.

1996 Bar was Hovendale's playground for the rich, where young heirs and the city's elites spent extravagantly. The music was never-ending, and the dance floor was wild.

In a luxurious and dimly lit booth, Stanley sat in the center of a leather sofa. Tonight, he had on a black shirt paired with black trousers. His sleeves were rolled up to his elbows, revealing his toned forearms and a steel watch worth millions. His aristocratic, striking features made him the center of attention, drawing glances from countless women in the bar.

Beside him was his close friend, Benny Gondale‚Äîthe heir of the Gondale family‚Äîand several other young elites.

Benny laughed. ""Stanley, are you serious? Wendy wants a divorce?""

The others laughed along. ""Everyone knows Wendy loves Stanley to the bone. When he was in a coma, she insisted on marrying him. There's no way she'd actually go through with a divorce.""

""Let's bet on it. How long do you think Wendy can hold out before begging Stanley to take her back?""

Benny smirked. ""I bet she can't even make it through tonight. She's probably already sent Stanley a message.""

Stanley's chiseled features remained cold and sharp, his mood clearly sour. He pulled out his phone and opened WhatsApp to check their chat history.

The last message from Wendy was from last night. She had sent a photo of the broth with the caption, \[Honey, even though your bone density is back to normal, you should still drink this broth regularly. Don't come home too late!\]

As he scrolled up, he saw countless similar messages‚Äîall from Wendy. She messaged him every day.

He had never replied. Not once.

Today, the chat was silent.

Stanley felt a vague sense of irritation.

Ding!

A notification popped up.

""See? I told you‚ÄîWendy messaged you!"" Benny immediately exclaimed.

Ding, ding, ding!

Several more notifications followed in quick succession.

The group burst out laughing. ""We knew it‚ÄîWendy couldn't hold out! But we didn't expect her to cave so fast.""

""Stanley, open them. Let's see how Wendy is begging you to reconcile,"" Benny urged.

Stanley's sharp eyebrows lifted slightly. Did she really send a message? If she regretted it so quickly, why did she make such a fuss this morning?

He tapped on the notifications, only to freeze.

Benny leaned over and read aloud, ""Dear VVIP customer, your card ending in 0975 has been charged 800 at Dazzling Nail Salon.""

The group collectively frowned.

Stanley scrolled further.

2,000.

86,000.

240,000.

There were no messages about reconciliations, only transaction notifications. The group fell silent, feeling like Wendy had slapped them all hard in the face.

Stanley's expression darkened and he slammed his phone onto the table. He didn't care how much money Wendy spent. What bothered him was that she had gone on a shopping spree right after their divorce. This woman was something else!

The once submissive Wendy, who had clung to him for three years, now seemed to have grown fangs.

""Stanley, what's Wendy up to? She's gone to do her nails and hair, and buy clothes. Is she trying to imitate Jessica?"" Benny commented.

""Jessica is Hovendale's Red Rose. Wendy's just a country bumpkin. No matter how hard she tries, she'll only be a pale imitation.""

""A swan is a swan. An ugly duckling will always be an ugly duckling.""

Everyone laughed at Wendy.

Suddenly, there was a commotion in the bar. All eyes turned toward the entrance.

Someone gasped, ""Look‚Äîan angel just walked in!""

**Chapter 4**

Wendy arrived.

After finishing their shopping spree at the mall, Cecelia brought Wendy directly to 1996 Bar. Tonight, she was determined to throw a celebration party for Wendy.

Wendy hadn't expected to run into Stanley and his friends here, but she could hear their mocking remarks.

She recognized Benny and the others in the luxury booth. They were part of Stanley's circle, and Benny was Stanley's close friend. Back when Stanley had a whirlwind romance with Jessica, they were all fans of Jessica, with Benny even regarding her as Stanley's future wife.

Over the past three years, Wendy had never truly integrated into their group. None of them ever accepted her.

The labels they plastered on her were always the same: desperate substitute bride, ugly duckling, country bumpkin, and the like.

When a man didn't love you, his friends wouldn't respect you either.

Cecelia, already fuming, rolled up her sleeves, ready to confront them. ""I'm going to tear their mouths apart!""

Wendy quickly held her back. ""Cecelia, forget it! We're divorced now‚Äîthere's no need to stoop to their level.""

Seeing Wendy's calm and indifferent demeanor, Cecelia reluctantly held back her temper. Then, as more and more people began to notice Wendy and exclaimed, calling her an angel, Cecelia's mood improved. ""Wendy, let's go. Time to party.""

Cecelia dragged Wendy to another luxury booth and waved her hand grandly. ""Bring all the male hosts from 1996 Bar over here!""

Meanwhile, back at Stanley's booth, Benny and the others continued to mock Wendy. That was when they felt an icy and sharp gaze fall upon them.

Looking up, they saw Stanley lazily lifting his cold gaze to glare at them.

His expression was chilling, displeased, and full of warning. The men stopped laughing, and they immediately shut up, not daring to speak ill of Wendy again.

Benny glanced at Stanley. Although Stanley had never paid much attention to Wendy, she had, after all, cared for him diligently for three years. It seemed Stanley still held some regard for that.

At that moment, the commotion around them grew louder.

""Wow, what a stunning angel!""

'An angel? Where?'

Following the direction of the crowd's gaze, Benny looked ahead and was instantly dumbfounded. ""Holy crap, she really is an angel.""

The other rich young men were equally astonished, their eyes glued to her. ""When did such a stunning angel begin existing in Hovendale? How have we never seen her before?""

Benny nudged Stanley. ""Stanley, look! It's an angel.""

Stanley, who had no shortage of women around him, wasn't interested. He had seen all kinds of women‚Äîslim, curvy, and everything in between. He had no intention of looking, but Wendy's booth happened to be right across from theirs.

When Stanley glanced over, he saw Wendy.

Without her black-framed glasses and her usual dull, conservative attire, she revealed a delicate, fair face, her naturally exquisite bone structure, and ethereal beauty shining through. Her long, glossy black hair flowed gracefully over her shoulders, making her look like a true angel.

Stanley paused, staring at her for two full seconds.

Benny was excited. ""Stanley, what do you think of the angel?""

Another rich young man chimed in, ""Mr. Hawk probably doesn't think much of her. Mr. Hawk likes delicate beauties like Jessica, not cold, aloof angels.""

""But look at her legs! Her legs are just as stunning as Jessica's.""

Wendy was wearing a short dress, shedding her usual conservative style and showing her legs for the first time.

Her legs were perfectly proportioned‚Äîslender yet shapely. Those were legs that could make any man's imagination run wild.

She looked just as good as Jessica.

Stanley stared at the 'angel' for a moment and couldn't shake the feeling that she looked familiar, as if he'd seen her somewhere before.

Just then, a line of male hosts walked in, all tall and handsome, forming a row in front of Wendy.

Cecelia grinned. ""Wendy, make your pick of eight.""

Deciding to indulge herself to celebrate her escape from the misery of marriage, Wendy smiled and pointed. ""You, you, you... All of you stay.""

Benny counted aloud. ""One, two, three... Eight! She actually picked eight male hosts at once!""

The other rich young men laughed. ""Why waste money? If the angel just asked, we'd serve her for free.""

Everyone chuckled.

Ding!

Stanley's phone buzzed again with a notification. Picking it up, he glanced at it to see what Wendy had spent on this time.

\[Dear VVIP user, your card ending in 0975 has been charged 500,000 at 1996 Bar for eight male hosts.\]

Stanley froze, staring at the words before raising his eyes toward the so-called angel across the room.

If that wasn't Wendy, who else could it be?

Stanley was speechless.

Eight male hosts surrounded Wendy, pouring drinks into her glass. ""Let's play a drinking game.""

Cecelia clapped happily. ""Yes, let's play!""

In the first round, Wendy lost. One of the male hosts handed her a drink. ""Please drink some.""

Wendy took a sip, but the other male hosts protested. ""Why drink his and not ours? We want to serve you too.""

Surrounded by all the attention, Wendy found it impossible to keep up, overwhelmed by the 'sweet burden' of their pampering.

Stanley's eyes narrowed, his handsome features tensing into a grim expression. Without a word, he stood up and strode out.

Benny was taken aback. ""Stanley? Where are you going?""

Wendy was about to take another drink when a large, strong hand reached over, grabbed her slender wrist, and pulled her up like she was a rag doll. Startled, she looked up to see Stanley's handsome face suddenly looming over her.

She froze for a second, then quickly tried to break free. ""Stanley, let go of me!""

His face darkened and he dragged her away without a word.

Cecelia stood up. ""Stanley, what are you doing? Let Wendy go!""

Benny and the others were completely stunned. They stared, dumbfounded, as if they had just misheard something.

""Wendy?""

""That angel is Wendy?""

""Is this the same ugly duckling Wendy we know?""

""She's actually stunning!""

As they watched Stanley drag Wendy away, her cold, ethereal beauty still lingering in their vision, Benny muttered, ""Wendy, who no longer chases after Stanley, just turned into a full-blown angel!""

\-

Stanley's grip was firm and unrelenting, like an iron shackle. No matter how much Wendy struggled, she couldn't break free.

His strides were long, forcing Wendy to stumble as she tried to keep up. ""Stanley, let go of me!""

Finally, Stanley stopped and flung her backward. Wendy's slender frame collided against the cold wall behind her.

Before she could regain her balance, Stanley's tall figure loomed over her, pressing her against the wall.

His eyes burned with fury. ""Wendy, do you think I'm dead, playing around like this?""

**Chapter 5**

Wendy furrowed her brows. ""What did I do?""

Stanley clenched his jaw. ""Who told you to dress like this?""

'What? Like this?' she wondered. ""What do you mean, Stanley?!""

Stanley glanced at her ultra-short skirt. ""Your legs are almost exposed. Do you really want people to see your legs like this?""

Wendy's skirt was a bit short, but it was Cecelia's choice.

Cecelia's exact words were, ""My dearest Wendy doesn't show her legs, but look at how Jessica flaunts hers. Tonight, let everyone see who has the best legs in Hovendale.""

Wendy raised her finely arched eyebrows. ""Looks like Mr. Hawk noticed my legs.""

Stanley paused.

Wendy leaned back against the wall, appearing languid and graceful. She slowly lifted her right leg, her crystal-high heel brushing against his ankle.

Stanley had on black trousers, showcasing his long, muscular legs, exuding an aura of coldness and restraint.

Wendy's pale foot gently grazed up his ankle, moving along his calf. It was an act of seduction and defiance.

Stanley shot her a cold glance. ""What are you doing?""

Wendy curved her lips into a smile. ""Mr. Hawk, which do you prefer? My legs, or Jessica's?""

Stanley stared at her small, delicate face that glowed with celestial radiance, yet she seduced him with a dazzling smile.

Last night, he had glimpsed the beauty hidden beneath her dark-rimmed glasses, but he hadn't expected her to be this beautiful.

He felt like he had seen this face somewhere before.

Wendy's clear eyes sparkled. ""Mr. Hawk, has Jessica ever wrapped her legs around your waist?""

Stanley's breath hitched. His handsome face moved closer to hers, his gaze softening with a tenderness Wendy had never seen before. ""Wendy, are you really this shameless? All you think about is men. You even hired eight male hosts to satisfy your needs!""

He didn't answer Wendy's question about Jessica. That was perhaps the best kind of protection a man could offer a woman.

Their love had been so passionate, full of youthful excitement. Jessica's legs had definitely wrapped around his waist, or else why would he still remember her so fondly?

Jessica was lucky to have a man like Stanley so deeply attached to her. He would never describe her as 'shameless.'

Though Wendy wore a smile, her eyes remained clear and distant. ""Well, Mr. Hawk, your body isn't up to par and can't satisfy me, so of course I have to go out and find men. Let's get divorced quickly. If the first man doesn't work, the next will be better.""

Did she actually say he was inadequate, and the next man would be better?

This woman was truly asking for it.

Stanley reached out, grabbing Wendy's chin. ""Are you trying to provoke me? Do you really want to know if I'm up to the task?""

'What?' Wendy froze.

Stanley moved closer to her lips, teasing, but with words that carried no warmth. ""Dream on. I won't touch you. The one I love is Jessica.""

He loved Jessica.

He didn't even need to say it‚ÄîWendy already knew. It stung her heart, the sharp pain spreading through her, though the ache wasn't obvious.

At that moment, a sweet voice rang out. ""Stanley.""

Wendy looked up‚ÄîJessica had arrived.

Jessica, the Red Rose of Hovendale, was a beautiful woman with rosy lips and perfect teeth, her body delicate from years of ballet training.

Stanley immediately released Wendy and walked toward Jessica. He lowered his gaze to meet hers, his eyes filled with a tenderness Wendy had never seen. ""You're here.""

Jessica nodded, then turned to Wendy. ""Who's this?""

Jessica didn't recognize Wendy at first.

However, Wendy would never forget Jessica.

Wendy and Jessica were stepsisters, but from completely different parents. Harry, Wendy's father, wasn't her biological father, but her stepfather.

Many years ago, Wendy had a happy family with her real father, Jerry, and her mother Lilian, who were always respectful toward each other.

Her father loved her dearly, always lifting her high. ""Wendy, please be happy always.""

Then, one day, her father suddenly passed away. Harry, Jerry's brother, moved in with his daughter Jessica. Wendy's mother became Jessica's mother as well.

Her mother remarried her second uncle. Her mother loved Jessica and stopped loving her.

When Jessica got an A in a test and Wendy got an A+, her mother hit her hand with a ruler. ""Can't you give your sister a break? Why must you outdo her?""

When Jessica fell ill and had to undergo chemotherapy, her head had to be shaved. She cried, saying she had become ugly.

In response, Wendy's mother immediately shaved Wendy's head. ""You should look the same as your sister so she won't cry.""

Every night, her mother, Jessica, and Harry would sleep together, laughing and playing.

Wendy, holding the doll her late father had bought her, would stand outside their door, crying alone. ""Mommy, I'm scared‚Ä¶""

Eventually, Jessica called her mother ""Mom,"" which made her mother incredibly happy. But then Jessica said, ""A mother can only have one daughter.""

One rainy day, Wendy's mother took her to the countryside and left her there.

Wendy chased after the car, crying uncontrollably.

""Mommy, don't leave me! I'll be good, I'll always put my sister before me‚Ä¶ Mommy, hold me‚Ä¶ I'm scared‚Ä¶!""

Wendy fell heavily into the muddy water while holding her doll, watching helplessly as her mother's car disappeared from view.

Wendy would never forget Jessica.

At that moment, Benny rushed over. ""Jessica, this is‚Ä¶your sister, Wendy!""

Jessica was stunned. ""You're Wendy?""

Wendy knew that Jessica had always looked down on her.

When they were young, Jessica had always been the one to beat her. As Jessica grew up, she excelled in everything. Later, she even dated Stanley, the heir of the Hawk family. She grew up in a world of admiration and love, full of pride and arrogance.

Benny, once again, was stunned by Wendy's ethereal beauty. He whispered, ""I didn't expect Wendy to be this beautiful.""

Jessica's memory of their childhood was fuzzy because she had never truly paid attention to her unloved sister. But wasn't her sister the ugly duckling from the countryside?

Jessica approached Wendy, glancing at her, her brow raised in haughty pride. ""Wendy, I didn't expect you to start dressing like me.""

Wendy remained silent. 'Well, if you say so,' she thought.

Wendy straightened her slender back, smiling but saying nothing. The light from the corridor illuminated her delicate, otherworldly face, making it glow like a precious pearl.

She was no longer the Wendy from before.

Jessica sneered. ""Wendy, I heard you're getting a divorce with Stanley. Can't you live without a man? Coming to a bar to hire male hosts to fulfill your desires? If I were you, I'd get a job.""

As she spoke, Jessica glanced at Stanley. In a tone that seemed almost benevolent, she added, ""Stanley, Wendy took care of you for so long. Even if she was your maid, you should at least find her a job.""

Stanley's gaze landed on Wendy's face.

""Jessica, nowadays, you need a degree to get a job. What's Wendy's education?"" Benny said.

Jessica seemed to recall something amusing. She lifted her chin and laughed.

# I will attempt to make an objective review of the movie. I‚Äôll try to break it down by category with examples.


sudo cat /usr/Content-Story.md
# Harkens back to the original Tron directly while interweaving Legacy visuals and directly calling out post-Legacy events Ares leverages. There are some plot gaps, but overall it works without too many gaps. The movie throws you into the world of Tron without too much back story outside of the beginning. It then fills in the story as it goes. There are a lot, and I mean a lot of throwbacks almost line for line and scene for scene to the previous Tron movies (e.g. security guy with coffee in the datacenter). The one line I didn‚Äôt hear was a euphemism to a ‚Äò big door‚Äô. Example plot gaps: How Eve and her sister were chosen as Encom‚Äôs CEOs and why Sam stepped away especially after the post-Legacy extras of Sam coming back.


sudo cat /bin/Pace-Acting.md
# The casting ties the actors to the characters well. Highly billed actors didn‚Äôt have ample screen time outside of Jared Leto. Jeff Bridges time was a fraction, and, adding a bit to the story above, requires me to go back and try to figure out how he exists as the initial reason was murky (something about a reflection of Ares?). Leto‚Äôs acting style worked here like it did in Blade Runner 2049 that I saw others describe as wooden or stiff because of the nature of the Ares character. The pacing kept the movie balanced between physical action and plot ramping. The pacing tried to mimic the tone and therefore was fast paced. There needed to be more depth to connect the actors to their primary purpose (e.g. Eve and her sister). Athena as the main action antagonist (Dillinger was the main story protagonist) intent was driven by programmed obedience in her Clu-like descent to a murderer where her nature as a program was colder and without emotion like Clu in Legacy, or Sark in the original Tron.


sudo cat /etc/Breakthroughs.md
# Programs killed humans for the first time when Athena killed Dillinger‚Äôs mom. Athena also killed multiple cops in a helicopter with a recognizer. The music was a fit for the pace and tone and connected the soundtrack, though I listened to the soundtrack and it stands alone too. Ares set itself up for a direct sequel between having Quora‚Äôs, what looked like GPS location, and the Sark transformation Dillinger experienced during the end credits. 

# Overall the movie tried to bring together old and new fan bases the best it could while opening a door for a completely new angle on Tron possibly in the future with ISOs and AI.

Subjective quick review: B 


Overall I think It will grow on me. I still fell something was off but can‚Äôt put my finger on it. I describe the feeling as reading the book Ready Player Two where the callbacks for Tron fans felt forced not natural, but weirdly appreciated them. It feels like this movie is targeted at a new generation of Tron fans and threw the OGs some bones but it felt off. Regardless, my favorite little call out  was the crack in Flynn‚Äôs grid light cycle arena wall Ares had to take to follow bit and the OG grid in general was stellar .


Again, as I think about it in an independent light I find myself warming to it, but only after not including previous Tron movies, tones, and motives. Dillinger was by far my favorite character with Seth, Eve‚Äôs‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt even know, her assistant? A close second for this comedic timing. The whole ‚Äòpermanence code‚Äô felt contrived, and the DNA callout felt like it should have connected the ISOs from Legacy to this, especially with Flynn‚Äôs grid still somehow connected to the Arcade even after Sam shut it down. Also, I don‚Äôt understand how neither Encom or Dillinger didn‚Äôt know about being able to send themselves to the grid, especially Encom. That‚Äôs a huge miss, but I get trying to explain that would‚Äôve blown up the storyline.

Hi Reddit. I‚Äôm F25 and I‚Äôm honestly at my breaking point with this one. I need outside perspective because my entire family is acting like I‚Äôm Hitler for standing my ground.

So, I (25F) am a student software developer and a pretty serious PC gamer in my free time. I live alone in a one-bedroom apartment that I‚Äôve spent years making cozy and functional. I saved up for a long time to build my dream PC setup ‚Ä¶ triple monitors, custom mechanical keyboard, ergonomic chair, the works. Altogether, my rig is worth a bit over $2,000, and I take care of it like it‚Äôs a damn child.

Last weekend, my older sister (30F) asked if she could crash at my place for one night because her apartment was being fumigated, and her husband was out of town. She has a 3-year-old son, Max, who‚Äôs‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs say ‚Äúspirited.‚Äù I love him, but he‚Äôs a little chaos goblin. I hesitated, but she swore she‚Äôd keep an eye on him and that it‚Äôd just be for one night.

They show up Saturday afternoon, and immediately it‚Äôs clear she wasn‚Äôt kidding about Max being a handful. Within ten minutes of arriving, he‚Äôd pulled four books off my shelf, thrown my houseplants on the floor, and spilled juice on my area rug. I tried to stay chill, he‚Äôs three, I get it ‚Ä¶ but I asked my sister politely to please keep him out of my office, where my PC setup is.

She rolls her eyes and goes, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs just exploring, he‚Äôs curious, it‚Äôs normal.‚Äù But she closes the office door anyway.

Cut to Sunday morning. I wake up to screaming. Max had apparently woken up before his mom, managed to open the office door, and decided my setup was his new jungle gym.

He pulled down one of my monitors, cracking the screen. He stuck crackers into the PC tower‚Äôs ventilation slots (I‚Äôm not kidding), yanked out my keyboard‚Äôs keycaps, and had colored on my chair with permanent marker. The cherry on top? He poured apple juice INTO the tower. INTO IT.

When I tell you I went silent‚Ä¶ I mean dead silent. My sister comes in, sees the damage, and just says, ‚ÄúOh nooo,‚Äù in this incredibly flat tone, like someone knocked over a cup of coffee. I start freaking out, and she has the AUDACITY to say, ‚ÄúYou should‚Äôve baby-proofed the room if it was that important to you.‚Äù

I lost it. I told her that 1) she KNEW he wasn‚Äôt supposed to be in there, 2) this is my space, not a damn daycare, and 3) baby-proofing a $2,000 gaming setup is not a standard requirement for adults living alone.

She told me to ‚Äúcalm down‚Äù and said that ‚Äúhe‚Äôs just a kid, and stuff is replaceable.‚Äù I told her she could replace it then. She said she didn‚Äôt have the money right now, but maybe in a few months she could give me a few hundred. I told her that wasn‚Äôt acceptable and that she needed to take full responsibility.

She left in a huff and now my whole family is blowing up my phone. My mom says I‚Äôm being ‚Äúmaterialistic‚Äù and should understand that my nephew didn‚Äôt mean it. My dad said I should‚Äôve ‚Äúlocked the door‚Äù if it was that important. My brother actually said, ‚ÄúWhy do you even need three monitors anyway? That‚Äôs kind of overkill.‚Äù

I‚Äôve filed a claim with my insurance but there‚Äôs no guarantee it‚Äôll be covered since it was technically ‚Äúguest damage.‚Äù I also told her that if she does not pay up, I'll take her to court for what happened.

Now I‚Äôm getting texts from my sister demanding an apology for ‚Äúblaming her kid for being curious.‚Äù I told her I‚Äôd drop it if she covered the cost of repairs and replacements ‚Ä¶ or at least met me halfway ‚Ä¶ and she BLOCKED me.

So‚Ä¶ Am I overreacting if I take my sister to court over this?

UPDATE: Wow. Just wow. Four hours later, I wake up from my nap to this. Thank you guys, it'll take a bit for me to read all of this.

My sister still has not unblocked me, but her husband reached out to find out what happened. I'm sorry I don't have more to tell yet, but I'll update again when I do. Seriously, thanks for the insights everyone. My head is a lot clearer now ‚ù§Ô∏è

**Update 2 (Same Post): Another 4 hours later**

UPDATE2: Hey all. My sister‚Äôs husband reached out as mentioned earlier, and we‚Äôre working out a solution if possible. He‚Äôs been really understanding as have all of you.

Also, to clarify the office situation: my one-bedroom apartment is on the smaller side (33m2/355sq ft?), so the landlord converted an old ex-clothes cabinet into a makeshift ‚Äôoffice.‚Äô It‚Äôs weird, but the building is from the 40s, and ig they had to get creative with the space with an old tenant or something. So its living room (sister and her kid slept there) + kitchen (i slept there) + the ‚Äôoffice.‚Äô

Thanks for all the support. And the award. I really don't have the words for how nice people have been in both DMs and the comments. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π

Thank you. ‚ù§Ô∏è

*Going no contact:*

>Yeah, I‚Äôm not ready to go full no contact right now, but I really appreciate your perspective.  
It‚Äôs definitely something I‚Äôll keep in mind if things keep escalating and no one starts showing even a little respect for my boundaries.  
I just want accountability, not drama. But if they keep pushing, I won‚Äôt hesitate to step back. I don't think I want to know my family if they can‚Äôt appreciate the work I put into my hobbies.  
Thanks for the insight. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Commenter (downvoted): Questions -

1. does your office door lock, if so why wasn't it locked?
2. how was this unattended 3 year old able to get his hands on crackers & apple juice in an apartment that he is presumably not familiar with? Why were these items so easy for him to get to?
3. if you knew in advance that he & your sister were coming, why wouldn't you make¬†*any*¬†effort to either secure delicate/important items or move them somewhere he can't reach?

>**OOP:**¬†1. The ‚Äúoffice‚Äù is a converted clothes closet. The apartment‚Äôs from the 40s and has a weird layout. There‚Äôs no lock on the door, the door is just a heavy old one. Tbh I‚Äôve been wondering if my sister might have opened it for him. I just don't get why??? 2. The crackers and juice weren‚Äôt mine, sister brought them. I had no idea he had access to them during the night until after the fact. 3. I didn‚Äôt get much notice. I saw her message around 10AM Saturday, and they arrived around 2PM. My place was a mess, so I spent most of that time cleaning before they came by. In hindsight, yeah, I should‚Äôve been more cautious with my setup, but it didn‚Äôt even cross my mind that anything like this would happen as I thought the office area was inaccessible to him. What he did pull off of the shelves was moved higher up and out of reach and in an area where he could be kept an eye on.

**Update**¬†[Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1k0jehq/update_aio_for_threatening_to_take_my_sister_to/)**: April 16, 2025 (5 days later)**

Hey again.

Just wanted to post a quick update since it‚Äôs been a little under a week and a few people asked what happened next. Things are better, pretty fucking weird, and still ongoing, but here‚Äôs where we're at.

Last Saturday, my brother-in-law (BIL) came over to check out the damage himself. He actually brought Max (toddler) with him, which I was almost livid about at first, but he had a reason. He asked Max to try opening the office/closet door. The kid couldn‚Äôt do it. The door was too heavy for him.

You probably can guess where this is going. :=)

BIL offered to take my PC to the store that originally built it for me, just to see what was fixable. I agreed, but asked for something in writing just so I had some peace of mind. We put together a little agreement that he‚Äôd be responsible for it while it was with him. Yeah, yeah, it was just a formality and would not hold much merit anywhere, but it helped me feel a bit more in control.

On Monday, he dropped it off at the shop and gave them my number so they could keep me updated. He also told me he confronted my sister about how things played out. I sent him my original Reddit post too, he read the comments and apparently showed them to her. She still hasn‚Äôt unblocked me, and from what I‚Äôve heard, was not happy about the fact my BIL is actually listening to me.

I also shared the post and some comments with my parents and brother since no one really believed me before. My parents still don‚Äôt fully get it, but they‚Äôve at least stopped pushing back. My brother is more understanding now, though for some reason he mostly wanted to talk about how many people saw the post. I don't think either of those three still care, really, and I'm fine if they see this. Do better.

Anyway, I went to see the PC today (wednesday here). The shop said it‚Äôs mostly salvageable. It needs a very very careful internal clean and a few fans replaced, and some wiring fixed, but overall the main parts survived somehow. BIL told me he‚Äôll cover the cost of the repair, no hesitation.

When I brought up what my sister said about not being able to pay even $200, he said she‚Äôs lying. He also said he‚Äôs not sure Max actually did all the damage. He thinks the door was left open on purpose, or that my sister might have even done some of it herself. Based on the height of the tower and where the crackers ended up, it didn‚Äôt quite add up to a toddler acting alone.

Apparently, she‚Äôs been telling him I have a ‚Äúgambling addiction‚Äù (I did get a bit hooked on Genshin like 4 years ago I guess?) and that maybe this whole thing will ‚Äúwake me up,‚Äù which is‚Ä¶ new. She used to be supportive or at least indifferent. No idea where that switch came from.

So yeah. That‚Äôs where we‚Äôre at:

* My PC is being cleaned up and fixed, and BIL is covering the cost.
* Sister still has me blocked and won‚Äôt talk to me. Still tempted to start something with her tbh, especially if she actually did all of this on purpose.
* Still not ruling out small claims court depending on how things go.

Thanks again to everyone who responded to the original post. Seeing how many people understood what happened really helped me hold the line with my family when I felt like I was losing my mind.

One thing I‚Äôve been turning over in my head lately is what if my sister¬†*did*¬†do something to my setup on purpose?

I don‚Äôt want to believe that, it feels like a stretch, but the more I think about it, the less so, I guess...? But then I remember how she acted when I asked her to keep Max out of the office. The eye-roll and the ""he's just curious"" comments like she didn‚Äôt take any of it seriously...??? And now hearing from my BIL that she‚Äôs been saying I have a ‚Äúcrippling gambling/gaming/whatever addiction‚Äù and needed to ‚Äúgrow up‚Äù????

It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ weird. She used to be cool about it. Never super into games herself, but she got that it was important to me. If something changed, I don‚Äôt know when or why. And if this was some weird way to make a point or ‚Äúteach me a lesson‚Äù‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs messed up. You're not our mom. How about talking first instead of this? I don‚Äôt want to jump to conclusions, but the more I think about it, the less it makes sense that Max could‚Äôve done all of that alone. It's sick if she blamed her own son for it.

So yeah. Not accusing anyone outright, but that thought is there now.

And if you're my sister reading this‚Ä¶ Which I'm guessing you are, because I bet you'd love to look at the comments that are on your side a lot. :)))

I don‚Äôt know why you blocked me. I don‚Äôt know what shifted in your head about all this. But if you actually had anything to do with damaging my setup whether it was on purpose or just through complete carelessness... Fuck. You. You know I worked hard for that. You know what that rig meant to me, and you know I would never do something like this to your stuff.

And if Max really did all of it on his own‚Ä¶ I hope you‚Äôre paying closer attention now. Not for my sake, but for his. Read the comments on my first post again, from other parents and people with younger siblings who CLEARLY know better than you. That's all.

Thanks for reading, those who did.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: Wait - I thought the whole family was blowing up your phone telling you how mean you were?

>**OOP:**¬†Yes a week ago, before my first post. Is there something I can clarify for you here? My sister was talking incredible smack about me to them, making it seem like I ‚Äùscreamed at her child‚Äù over a ‚Äùminor mistake.‚Äù I do see the people going ‚Äùhaha blowing up her phone‚Äù and I do not understand what is wrong with the wording?

Commenter: I think chatgpt is being used a lot on Reddit lately, especially in AITA type subs and a common indicator that it‚Äôs a fake post is that AI always uses the ‚Äúblowing up my phone‚Äù phrase so that‚Äôs probably why they‚Äôre questioning it

>**OOP:**¬†Ohh‚Ä¶ I see. ü§£ Thank you for clarifying! Beep, boop.

Commenter: I‚Äôm really glad things are turning for the better. But what about the other damages (Gaming chair, keyboard, etc)?

>**OOP:**¬†My chair is okay, the cushion, legs and back are stained with red permanent marker but I‚Äôve learned to live with it. Coworkers and I are trying to find a chemical to fix the situation on the cushions, but an ethanol solution (small amounts, i dont want to ruin the chair further) has slowly been working at cleaning the other parts. (being a janitor does have its perks)  
Keyboard‚Ä¶ ehh. I could not find all of the keycaps that were pulled off. I replaced the missing ones with an old keyboard‚Äôs ones (both mechanical) so it‚Äôs a bit awkward but it works for now. I might get custom ones for it if I find some that fit.  
The cracked monitor on the other hand needs to be replaced. I guess calling it ‚Äùcracked‚Äù was a kindness in itself. Still got the other two left and at least it wasnt the most expensive one‚Ä¶ but yeah. 3:

Commenter: Um, why aren't you just having your bil pay for a new keyboard and monitor? Or professional cleaning for the chair? That's all part of the repairs.

>**OOP:**¬†We are waiting to see if my sister confesses to anything. If so, she will be paying out of her own pocket (and paying back), not my BIL. If she confesses and refuses, then, well‚Ä¶ üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏èüìùüîí  
The computer is essential, but the keyboard works and I still have two monitors. Thats why I am willing to wait for the other damage to be solved.

*The 'addiction':*

>I'll admit, during covid, I did spend $300 on Ganyu when she came out, but that was the ‚Äôworst‚Äô of it. (And it was so worth it)  
I don't play much anymore, (mostly stuck on Marvel Rivals rn) but the overall margin from Genshin release to this day I've spent under $600.  
I get it, even that might look crazy to people who don't play video games, but sheesh. GAMBLING addiction‚Ä¶? Bruh.  
She should be more concerned of what I spend on Pokemon packs in this economy, if she's gotta be concerned over something. ü§£ü§£ü§£

**Update**¬†[Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1kds0zk/my_25f_sister_30f_is_spiraling_but_i_dont_know/)¬†**2: May 3, 2025 (over 2 weeks later, 3 from OG post)**

**Title:**¬†My \[25F\] sister \[30F\] is spiraling but I don‚Äôt know how or if I should help.

A few weeks ago, I made a post (not here) about how my sister‚Äôs toddler \[3M\] almost destroyed my PC setup. Long story short, she and her son were staying with me for one night, he got into my office, and the whole setup got wrecked with juice and cracker bits shoved into the tower. The situation was awful, and when I asked my sister for help covering the damage, she made an excuse and blamed me instead.

It became whole family drama. My sister blocked me and acted like the whole thing was my fault, but her husband (my BIL) reached out on his own. He checked the damage himself, helped take the PC in for repairs, and ended up covering the costs because he was genuinely embarrassed by the way she acted. He even started questioning whether their toddler could have done that much damage on his own, especially after the kid couldn‚Äôt even open the door by himself. My BIL thought maybe my sister left it open or did something herself.

Within a week of that, my BIL confronted her and well, she kicked him out of the house. Like, full-on, told him to get the hell out, packed up his things, dumped them and left them by the curb like he was a stray dog. He told me she screamed that he was ‚Äúbetraying her‚Äù and ‚Äútaking the side of that fucking Reddit bitch,‚Äù meaning me. She also apparently accused him of conspiring and cheating on her with me to ‚Äúhumiliate her publicly,‚Äù which‚Ä¶ What???

She hasn‚Äôt let him see their kid since. No visits. No phone calls. She‚Äôs gone full black hole mode and is completely unreachable, threatening cops if he goes near. She‚Äôs blocked me, my brother, even some extended family, and is only talking to our parents, who are still enabling her but I think its only so they can keep Max at arm‚Äôs lenght.

Meanwhile, I‚Äôm hearing rumors she‚Äôs been telling people I‚Äôm unhinged, psychotic, and that I made the whole thing up. She told one of our cousins that I ‚Äúlured‚Äù her kid into the office like some kind of trap or setup.

I don‚Äôt know if this is postpartum-related, or if something snapped, or if she‚Äôs just always been this vindictive and I didn‚Äôt want to see it. But I‚Äôm scared. Scared for her kid. Scared for her husband. And yeah I‚Äôm also scared for myself, because if she‚Äôs willing to ruin her whole marriage and turn the family against me just to protect a lie‚Ä¶?

My parents want to keep it under wraps, but I know my BIL wants to get her help. I want to get her help too, but I don‚Äôt know where to start or what to do.

What can I start with to possibly push her towards someone who can help her out? Has someone here dealt with a situation like this before? I feel helpless, as I know she is an adult and has free-will but I fear for her safety and my nephew‚Äôs safety as well‚Ä¶

My BIL voiced wanting to divorce her and told my parents he will get his son whether they approve or not. His side of the family is furious with mine and I‚Äôve no idea where I stand because yeah, I guess I started this.

Is this salvageable? If so, how? What can I do? Who can I contact within the states‚Ä¶? Is there anything I can do even? Does anyone know?

***Top Comments:***

**LhasaApsoSmile:**¬†I think your parents need to talk to her because this is crazy. The kid did what 3 yo's do but she failed as a mother by not minding him. Your BIL stepped up to fix it. But her reaction is nuts. There has to be more here. I think your parents are in a better place to figure out what is going on.

**Update**¬†[Post](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok-Jelly-6298/comments/1lk9axs/a_brief_underwhelming_update_aio/) **3: June 25, 2025 (over 1.5 months from previous post, 2.5 from OG)**

Hello everyone,

It‚Äôs been a while, so I didn‚Äôt want to post this on AIO, but for those still interested in my situation, here‚Äôs an update. :)

The good news first:

* My PC is fully functional again. The store was able to recover it!
* My nephew is now in a safe and stable environment with my brother-in-law.

Unfortunately, there have also been some difficult developments:

* My brother-in-law is currently in the process of separating from my sister.
* It seems I‚Äôve essentially been disowned by my mother, and now, it appears, by my father as well. The only one still in contact with me is my brother.

Thank you to those who have checked in or supported me during all this. It truly means a lot.

***OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: Good to hear things are fixed with th pc now, but that's awful that you've been disowned by your parents. Why did they do that? Unless I'm remembering wrong, they were only in contact with her to have access to their grandkid.

Sounds like you're in the middle of a lot right not so I won't push, but I wish you luck. Just know that people are on your side and are praying for you üôè

>**OOP:**¬†Thank you! I am very happy to hear that.  
My parents have unfortunately been swayed by my sister's lies. I guess I can say that she is of the mind that BIL was cheating on her with me and that we want to ""steal her son."" I am still trying to cope with what has happened (poorly, but work and studies keep me busy thankfully...) and to clear the air.  
There is a lot happening as you guessed, but I'll give out more updates after everything settles down. Right now I'm just taking it one day at a time.

Commenter: I'm glad your nephew is safe! Try to keep that connection - he'll appreciate it in the future.

I wish you the best of luck with the rest of the family. It's not your fault & you need to work to accept that. Maybe find a therapist to talk this thru with? You need to protect your mental health. I'm also a younger sister & I took on way too much of trying to fix things when I was your age.

>**OOP:**¬†Thank you for the advice! Therapy hadn't even crossed my mind... I'll look into it for sure!

# New Update

**\*\*\*\*\*Final Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1nw3wjd/final_update_aio_for_threatening_to_take_my/)**: October 2, 2025 (3.5 months later, 6 from OG post)\*\*\*\*\***

Hey everyone. This is the final update to my posts on¬†[r/AmIOverreacting](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/)¬†:

* [AIO for threatening to take my sister to court after her toddler destroyed my $2,000 gaming setup because she said I should‚Äôve ‚Äúbaby-proofed my apartment‚Äù?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1jwo74t/aio_for_threatening_to_take_my_sister_to_court/)
* [\[UPDATE\] AIO for threatening to take my sister to court after her toddler destroyed my $2,000 gaming setup because she said I should‚Äôve ‚Äúbaby-proofed my apartment‚Äù?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1k0jehq/update_aio_for_threatening_to_take_my_sister_to/)

It‚Äôs been a long while since I last posted, and honestly I wasn‚Äôt sure if I wanted to give another update at all. A lot has happened over the past six months, some of it good, some of it really heavy, and some of it that I‚Äôm still struggling to process. But I know a lot of you followed the whole thing from the beginning and my direct messages have been full of so many awesome, supportive people, I feel as if I owe all of you a final update before letting this matter go.

First, the positives: My PC is alive and well and has been for a while. The shop did a miracle job restoring it and it‚Äôs running beautifully again. It almost feels symbolic now, like after everything blew up in my life, at least this one thing that mattered to me is still standing. xd

I‚Äôve also gotten closer to my brother-in-law (well, ex-BIL now, I guess, though it feels weird to call him that since he‚Äôs still family to me). He has full custody of my nephew, and that little kid is thriving. He‚Äôs calmer, happier, and honestly just a joy to be around in ways I didn‚Äôt even realize before. And he turned four¬†*after*¬†all the court stuff ended, so we could have his birthday in peace!!! :)

My BIL has his own family helping him, and I‚Äôve been pitching in too whenever I can. It‚Äôs exhausting at times, but I don‚Äôt regret a second of it. My nephew deserves stability, and my BIL deserves support after everything he‚Äôs had to go through. Watching him step up as a single dad has been inspiring.

Now for the complicated part: my family.

When things first went down, my parents were still on my sister‚Äôs side, and I was basically the black sheep. But something happened during the legal proceedings that made them realize she wasn‚Äôt well and that I hadn‚Äôt been exaggerating about any of it. For the first time in what feels like forever, they stopped defending her blindly. They actually reached out to me, apologized, and admitted they‚Äôd been wrong... well, kind of. But I couldn't be asked to escalate it again. It‚Äôs been slow, but they‚Äôve been trying to rebuild things with me. Part of me resents that it took them¬†*this much*¬†to finally see the truth, but I‚Äôm also relieved not to be completely estranged from my parents anymore. I'm still trying to decide what kind of a relationship they deserve to have with me after all of this.

As for my sister‚Ä¶

I don‚Äôt even know how to start. During the custody battle, she completely broke down. A lot of stuff came out, including the fact that she had broken and damaged other people‚Äôs things in the past (friends, her coworker's stuff), intentionally. She admitted she did it because, in her words, BIL ‚Äúowed her more‚Äù as the mother of their child, and destroying things was her way of ‚Äúmaking him notice her.‚Äù

She also said something else that stuck with me: that when she broke things, she felt powerful. She said people underestimated her, ignored her, treated her like she was just ‚Äúa mom.‚Äù But when she destroyed something, she knew she couldn‚Äôt be ignored. It forced people to react, and it sure did. I know some of the people witnessing this in real time still pity her, which... I don't know how to feel about it.

Still, it explains so much of her behavior, not just with the PC, but with her marriage, with our family and how she‚Äôs spiraled. She wanted to feel like she mattered, but instead of asking for help in a healthy way or seeking support, she turned to control and destruction. And when that wasn‚Äôt enough, she escalated.

Writing that out makes me feel so sad, honestly. It‚Äôs like everything I suspected about the PC wasn‚Äôt just a suspicion. And to think all of this could have been avoided if she sought help or accepted going to couple's therapy properly. Apparently my BIL had suggested it a few times to her, but she declined.

After she lost custody of my nephew, things spiraled fast. She had a complete breakdown, and long story short, she‚Äôs now in jail awaiting transfer to a psychiatric facility. I don‚Äôt want to go into every detail, but it‚Äôs safe to say it‚Äôll be a long time before I see her again. Or want to see her again.

And here‚Äôs the part I can‚Äôt quite make peace with: I feel bad for her.

I know that might sound crazy after everything she put me through, after how she tore our family apart, and after what she did to her own son. But she‚Äôs still my sister. There‚Äôs this ache I can‚Äôt quite get rid of, because I don‚Äôt know if the person she is now is who she always was, or if something in her just snapped along the way. I look back on our childhood and teenage years and wonder if there were signs that I missed, if there was some pattern of behavior I brushed off as moodiness or sibling rivalry that was actually something worse.

What complicates those feelings even more is everything that happened after my posts started spreading. I never expected them to blow up the way they did. I just wanted an outside perspective because my whole family was gaslighting me, making me feel insane for protecting my own belongings. And then, suddenly, it was everywhere. On Twitter, YouTube, Tiktok, even some news article was made about it. Someone tagged me to let me know that Smosh had even featured my story, which was surreal and honestly sort of humiliating in its own way. (Even though being noticed was kind of cool, I guess?)

Strangers were debating my family like it was some kind of reality TV show, and I had no control over it. At first, I was grateful for the validation, but over time, it started to eat away at my conscience. Keeping my posts public turned out to be a mistake.

I know hindsight is 20/20, but I regret not locking them down sooner. By the time BIL‚Äôs lawyer told us it would be best to hide everything, the damage had already been done. My sister had already seen the comments and the full force of the internet turned against her. And she hyperfixated on it.

That is not just me speculating either, one of our cousins told me she would rant constantly about it during the legal proceedings, always bringing it back to the posts and how I had ‚Äúpublicly humiliated her.‚Äù Apparently, she would spend hours scrolling, trying to dig up my posts, looking for new comments, even after I hid them. It was like pouring salt in a wound, and she couldn‚Äôt stop picking at it.

I keep asking myself if I made things worse by letting it all stay up as long as it did. If I gave her more ammunition for her paranoia orr if I pushed her further toward the breakdown that ended with her losing everything. Part of me feels like I failed her, like maybe if I had been more careful, she wouldn‚Äôt have spiraled so badly. But then another part of me reminds myself that it wasn‚Äôt the internet that broke her, it was something already inside her. The posts didn‚Äôt cause her to smash my PC, or to lash out at BIL, or to neglect her own child. Those were choices she made long before Reddit ever came into the picture.

I realize there‚Äôs no point in deleting them. Even if I scrubbed my entire account clean, the internet never forgets. Copies are out there somewhere, archived and dissected on forums I‚Äôll never even see. I can‚Äôt control that, no matter how much I might want to. What I can control is how I move forward, how I take care of myself, my nephew, and the family I still have.

The truth is, moving forward has been a mixed bag. On one hand, my daily life feels lighter without the constant chaos of my sister‚Äôs presence. I‚Äôm not coming home to find something broken, I‚Äôm not waking up to accusatory texts, and I‚Äôm not walking on eggshells waiting for the next outburst. That alone has been a kind of freedom I didn‚Äôt realize how badly I needed. On the other hand, there‚Äôs this strange emptiness where she used to be. Even if her presence was destructive, she was still there, part of the fabric of my family, and now there‚Äôs just this jagged hole.

My nephew asks about her sometimes. He doesn‚Äôt fully understand what happened, of course. He just knows ‚Äúmommy is sick‚Äù and can‚Äôt take care of him right now. BIL and I try to keep our answers simple, but the truth is, I don‚Äôt know what kind of relationship, if any, he‚Äôll be able to have with her in the future. I think about that a lot, because no matter how much I‚Äôve been hurt by her, I can‚Äôt help but imagine what it‚Äôll feel like for him one day when he‚Äôs old enough to learn the truth. How do you explain to a child that their mother did what my sister has done? How can it ever make sense to him? I don't know what to do when the day comes that either BIL or I have to explain what happened.

As for me, I‚Äôve been in therapy since all of this started (recommended by some of the lovely people in the comments and in my direct messages, thank you.) At first, it was just a way to vent, but it‚Äôs become essential, to be honest. My therapist keeps reminding me that none of this is my fault and that my sister‚Äôs choices were her own, that I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúruin her life‚Äù by posting about the PC, and that it‚Äôs not my job to fix her. I hope to one day believe everything that my therapist is telling me.

As for my sister, I don‚Äôt know what the future holds for her, or if she‚Äôll ever get better.

But if anyone else has problems like this, maybe be a bit more careful than I was. I spent the last months worrying I'd get charged with something for causing emotional turmoil over a Reddit post.

On a positive note, the stress caused me to get reconnected with an old hobby, retro electronics! Did you know the 3DS is considered retro now? I didn't! I feel old! I'm the same age as Pokemon Crystal!!!

Anyways, from now on I will be focusing on graduating and working to help my BIL pay off the debt that accumulated during the legal proceedings/investigation. But now that it's over, it's nice to know that at least for the coming months, things should be peaceful for me and those who matter the most to me. :)

Thank you to everyone who followed this from the beginning. Àö ö‚ô°…ûÀö

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: The only thing I can tell you is that you're not wrong for feeling bad for your sister.¬†**This is not advice that you should forgive her**, to be clear. But she was (and is, debatably!) an important part of your life, feeling bad for her is normal empathy for your loved ones. I hope she finds a way to process her mental issues and is able to authentically and meaningfully make amends to you and your family.

Regarding posting everything online: I mean, yeah, with the benefit of hindsight, it probably would have been better to delete the posts as soon as you got the insight you needed, but that seal is already long-since broken. Deleting at this point is no good, given how many times it's been reposted/commentated on.

>**OOP:** Thank you, you really hit the nail on the head. I‚Äôm not ready to forgive, but I can still feel for her. It‚Äôs a weird, heavy mix of emotions. I appreciate your thoughtful words and hope for healing, however long it takes. :)

Commenter: What an update ! \[...\] And did you ever find out if your nephew actually touched your PC, or it was all done by your sister (the crackers, apple juice...) ?

>**OOP:** Yes, I guess Reddit really does love a ""saga"" like this. And yes, all the crackers and juice were 100% my sister. -\_- ...Thank you for your kind words!

Commenter: \[...\] Also, don‚Äôt feel bad about blogging about this. It may have added fuel to your sister‚Äôs struggle‚Ä¶but if you hadn‚Äôt either (a) she would have found something else to be paranoid about/obsess over (as is common in mental health issues) or (b) may have been able to continue sweeping her issues under the rug and never gotten the help she needs.

>**OOP:** That‚Äôs a really thoughtful perspective. You‚Äôre right, if it hadn‚Äôt been the posts, it might‚Äôve been something else. I appreciate the reassurance and your kindness. Thank you!

*Therapy for nephew and forgive yourself:*

>I agree, therapy has already helped me a lot, and I‚Äôm looking into it for my nephew too. (I believe my BIL may have been recommended something after the court case for custody ended?) Thank you for the reminder to forgive myself, that part is a work in progress. I‚Äôll try to update down the road if things shift more, maybe in a few years at least. I'm a bit over the internet right now. xd

Commenter: \[...\]Side Note: Out of curiosity -- what is the PC that you got and the monitors? (Asking as a person who is looking for a gaming PC)

>**OOP:** There‚Äôs something really comforting in what you shared, thank you. Sibling dynamics can be a¬†*lot.*

So when mom met her current boyfriend and he was loving, caring, making an effort I thought they were in it for the long haul. Over the past 3 almost 4 years however, the man has gone from Gomez Addams to Homer Simpson: a lump on the couch or a 3rd kid for mom, by not helping out around the house (he lives with Mom & I) to the point where mom almost DIED at the beginning of September from stress. This past Sunday, mom & I spent ALL DAY cleaning the house for my upcoming birthday party, & not only was he out at the park playing with his RC cars during that time, BUT 80% OF THE MESS WAS HIS!!! That was the last straw for ME as he didn't even help cook dinner & it was 8pm BEFORE WE ATE DINNER cause he hid in their shared bedroom until then. My sister moved out for mental health treatment last year, so now it's just the 3 of us. I'm so embarrassed that his stuff is everywhere, and that we AREN'T ABLE TO USE OUR COFFEE TABLE FOR BOARD GAMES! I don't even want him to be living with us anymore, but mom needs to put things in place to make it so he can move out, like getting him to condence his mess. Is there ANYTHING I can do to help speed the process up without making mom feel rushed? Is the ball in his court? Also both my mom & I are in therapy and are working with the therapists to get thru this. Just wanted some extra advice before my next appointment. Thanks!",1,1759982403.0,Advice,0,0.99,False

So, I just stumbled upon something *mind-blowing* that I can‚Äôt wait to share with you all. Have you ever thought about how to make passive income while living your best life, or perhaps while zoning out on a Netflix binge? Because let‚Äôs be honest, we‚Äôre all about that work-life balance, right? üòè

**Let‚Äôs dive in:** I recently came across a blueprint for scaling faceless channels to **$10K a month** by 2024! üöÄ 

Yeah, you read that right. Just imagine waking up to notifications of income rolling in while you sipped your morning coffee. Sounds dreamy, right? Here's a little sneak peek into what I discovered‚Ä¶

### 1. **Pick Your Niche Wisely**
   - You‚Äôve gotta love it. If you‚Äôre passionate about knitting, cat videos, or even strange fruit combinations, **own it**! Choose something that resonates with you and your audience.
   - Research is key. Check out what others in your niche are doing. Don‚Äôt reinvent the wheel but make sure yours has some cool rims! üòÑ

### 2. **Content is King!**
   - Yes, you need awesome content‚Äîbut what‚Äôs even better? **Repurposing** old content! 
   - Think: blog posts, infographics, and videos; they all have life beyond their initial release. Turn that long article into snappy social posts!

### 3. **Automate Like a Pro ü§ñ**
   - Automation tools can be your BEST friend. Seriously, I‚Äôm talking about scheduling your posts, automating email marketing, and so much more.
   - This way, you‚Äôre working smarter, not harder! It‚Äôs like setting your own little income-generating machine on autopilot. 

### 4. **Engage and Connect**
   - Here‚Äôs the kicker: don‚Äôt be a stranger! Engage with your audience. Start conversations, ask questions, and be relatable. People love a good story. Share your journey‚Äîyour highs and lows.
   - Trust builds loyalty, and loyal followers will share your content like wildfire.

### 5. **Check out the Guide**
   - Want a roadmap to do this without losing your mind? üí• I found this amazing program that could kickstart your journey towards scaling those channels: [Maximize Me](https://www.checkout-ds24.com/redir/540531/maximizeme/). 
   - It‚Äôs like having a mentor on speed dial. 

Now, I can feel the excitement buzzing‚Äîwhat if we made 2024 the year of *huge faceless success*? Think about endless possibilities like traveling whenever you want or finally treating yourself to that fancy coffee every day! 

But hey, I wanna hear your thoughts! Who‚Äôs already dipping their toes into faceless content? What are your wins and struggles? Let‚Äôs brainstorm together! üí¨

This is probably the dumbest post I‚Äôll ever make on Reddit but hear me out because the issue is maybe more nuanced than my title. And I‚Äôm not asking if I‚Äôm an AH for paying for the services of a Dominatrix, but feel free to weigh in I guess. 

I‚Äôm a dude. I‚Äôm of legal age. Everyone referenced in this story is of illegal age. No age gaps that would be commonly be found inappropriate on Reddit exist. 

I‚Äôve had a femdomme kink for basically as long as I have been sexually aware. Finding romantic/sexual partners who want to engage with this activity has been difficult, but has happened on occasion. Finding any romantic or sexual partners in general has been difficult as of late. Wanting to meet my needs, I have visited three separate professional Dominatrices. ‚ÄúO‚Äù I saw on two occasions, but this story does not directly relate to her and she won‚Äôt be referenced again. ‚ÄúB‚Äù I saw on two occasions. And most recently, I saw ‚ÄúG‚Äù once. All were great experiences in their own ways. None of these encounters involved penetrative or oral sex, so from what I understand legal. 

I really liked seeing B and wished for it to continue, but our schedules did not line up well so trying to find times for sessions was difficult. I was also feeling romantically unfilled/like a loser (not in a good way) for paying for the company of a woman. So I got on the dating apps. One of these apps was specifically for kinky life stylists. The app allows for Findommes, but they must disclose that‚Äôs what they are. 

On this app, I matched with G. We struck up a conversation and quickly moved off-app. At first I did not notice that she had the findomme disclaimer and honestly she might not have had it when I first liked her profile, because I believe I had findommes filtered out. I apologized for the misunderstanding, sent her a little money for wasting her time. But I actually enjoyed our conversations. So being a doofus, I continued to send her money, discussed what kinks we were interested in and planned on meeting. One of these kinks that I mentioned, which will be relevant soon, was basically being led on to believe that there was a chance for a relationship extending beyond the crudely transactional nature of this one. Maybe of note, whereas the other pro-Dommes I had seen were incredibly experienced, G was very new.

Day our ‚Äúdate‚Äù arrives. We started off at a nice restaurant. Very vanilla. But it feels like a first date that‚Äôs going well. We hug when we meet, we have good conversation, eye contact, waiter says he saw us before we came in and we looked cute. It feels like there‚Äôs actual chemistry there. This isn‚Äôt something I‚Äôve done before. I met the other pro-Dommes at their ‚Äúdungeons‚Äù and after a brief chat, immediately got into stuff like protocols and limits. This is a girlfriend experience, I guess.

After dinner, we meet at a hotel room. We‚Äôre planning to spend the full night there, including sleeping (in the same bed) together. We engage in some activities before taking a break. She‚Äôs started her period, so we walk to a nearby convenience store and I buy her a box of tampons. We get back to the room and continue activities. After activities we start kissing. I‚Äôve never kissed a pro-Domme before. Usually not an activity they offer. Any expressly stated kink dynamic ceases. We‚Äôre just two people making out on a bed. 

Eventually she wants to go out for a smoke. We talk a lot. Stuff like our childhoods, our future ambitions. She asks me if I‚Äôd ever like to come with her to her friend‚Äôs art show. She tells me how much I‚Äôll like her friends. We‚Äôre holding hands. Consciously I‚Äôm aware that I asked for something approaching a girlfriend experience. But this doesn‚Äôt feel like an act. Usually when there‚Äôs a role play type dynamic going on, the kayfabe is obvious. I ask her ‚Äúis this how you treat all of your subs?‚Äù and her answer was something along the lines of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just me.‚Äù

Eventually we go back to our room and fall asleep cuddling. When we wake up, we check out of the room, grab coffee and spend some more time talking before departing. I tell her that I really like her. She tells me that she likes me too. She tells me if I don‚Äôt hear back from her immediately, it‚Äôs because she‚Äôs working on herself. 

I get home. This is Sunday. My head‚Äôs a bit of a mess. Was that connection real? Or am I just like an idiot who believes the stripper really likes him? I certainly regret asking to be led on, because if that‚Äôs what she was doing she was incredibly convincing about it and I‚Äôm emotionally whiplashed. 

The next day I send her a quick casual text. Here‚Äôs the where the part where I think I‚Äôm an AH starts: B messages me on Fetlife asking if I‚Äôm available this week. She‚Äôs available on a day that I have off. I scheduled a session with her. Later in the day, B posts a photo of herself holding a leash with the caption ‚Äúsit‚Äù. I comment on it ‚Äúme soon‚Äù. G is not on Fetlife as far as I‚Äôm aware, but perhaps has friends who are. G and B do not know each other well but G has gone to a Munch B hosts and a kink event that B attended. 

I‚Äôm already feeling guilty about scheduling with B when maybe (but almost assuredly not) have something real developing with G. I haven‚Äôt received a text message back from G since Monday (it is now Wednesday) but she told me not to expect to hear back immediately right? G calls me tonight while I‚Äôm getting ready for bed. I was listening to music in my AirPods when I answered. My AirPod microphone doesn‚Äôt work, but I always forget this when taking calls. I hear her asking ‚Äúhello‚Äù and I try to respond, but she obviously can‚Äôt hear me. Before I can switch off Bluetooth, she hangs up. Immediately I try to call her back, straight to voicemail. I try a few more times and every time, straight to voicemail. I send her a text. I still haven‚Äôt heard back. I messaged her on Insta as well. She hasn‚Äôt been online since she tried calling me. I‚Äôm guessing that she blocked my number.

Anyways, I assume one way or another, she found out about me scheduling a session with B. She tried to call me to confront me about it and after the failed phone call, she decided to cut contact. I haven‚Äôt heard anything from B, so I would bet that G saw the Fetlife post rather than hearing directly from B.

To me whether or not I‚Äôm an AH hinges on this: if this was purely a transactional relationship for her, I don‚Äôt feel particularly bad. She‚Äôs going to see other guys in the same capacity as she saw me, why would it be wrong for me to see other women in the same capacity as I saw her. But if the chemistry I thought I felt was real, that‚Äôs more complicated. We obviously had no agreement of exclusivity. But if I went out on an actual date with a woman that seemed to go well, I wouldn‚Äôt plan a date with another woman the next day. 

Tl;dr I‚Äôm a gross man and need to sort my life out.

[My journey leading up to the surgery here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ACL/comments/1nrgpdk/revision_acl_surgery_next_week_any_advice/)

And here is my 1-week post-op:

**Day 0: Surgery Day**

My surgery was scheduled for 2pm. To kill time and calm, went to the beach in the morning, enjoyed the weather, and coffee. \~ 11am, took an Uber to Kaiser Otay Mesa. Checked in and waited for about an hour, then started freaking out because I remembered I took a MgGlycinate  that morning probably not a good idea before anesthesia. Checked with an AI - they most likely  cancel my surgery. Panicked more. Once I was escorted to the pre-op room, I told everyone I met about the Mg. Nobody seemed concerned. Finally met the anesthesiologist ‚Äî he also didn't care. g2g!

Went into the OR, got knocked out, and woke up \~5pm feeling pretty dizzy but with no real pain. Had an apple juice and a cracker (I expected more, TBH). Didn‚Äôt see my doctor (guess he‚Äôd already left, like most of the other personnel). Nurse helped me get dressed, into a wheelchair, and then into the car. From wake-up to being in the car was literally 30 minutes ‚Äî felt like they were kicking me out, haha.

Got home and went straight to bed. Felt no pain (thnks to the nerve block) and slept fine until \~3am. Then the pain hit -> oxy -> back to sleep.

**Day 1:**

The first half of the day was okay, managed with some oxy. Did some reading about my surgery and found out I also had a meniscus repair (surprise), a minor one -> no weight-bearing past 90 degrees. They also removed some old hw and a failed artificial graft, though a few screws from the previous surgery were left in.

**Days 2‚Äì3:**

The nerve block wore off completely - the pain was no joke. Oxy, Tylenol, and my Iceman machine were my best friends. The highlight: successfully taking a poop (thanks, Miralax, I guess)

**Day 4:**

A real turning point! Slept through the night without oxy. The sharp pain faded into something manageable. Developed a super itchy rash under my ACE wrap that drove me crazy.

**Day 5:**

First decent day where I felt kinda normal. Went to Kaiser to get my bandages checked. Was surprised to see only one main scar (from the patellar tendon graft) and one really small one. Maybe more? will check later.

**Day 6:**

First PT appointment. Turns out my quad was basically ‚Äúoff‚Äù... I thought it was fine since I could lift my leg after surgery. Nope! They put me on an NMES unit to reactivate it and suggested I get one for home (Got one, but no luck with the quad so far). They gave me some exercises to do, and for the next 6 weeks, I‚Äôll be doing everything at home with weekly in-person check-ins. At 7 weeks, I‚Äôll join an ACL rehab group class.

**Day 7:**

Best sleep yet! No real pain at rest, just stiffness. Tylenol is enough to manage soreness after exercises. I‚Äôm doing flexion/extension  3-4 times a day. Extension is almost there (maybe not), flexion is slow, maybe 10 degrees so far.

**My Takeaways:**

Oxy helps, especially the first few nights. But if you take oxy, take Miralax.

The itchiness under the wrap is crazy. A tube sock as a barrier + cold pads help.

Must-haves: Cold therapy machine, shower stool, and a shower leg sleeve.

Hi, Nag ka bf ako at the age of 18, then yung bf ko is 19 before. May kapatid na babae yung bf ko. Then parents nya minsan ulam nila lunch or dinner is pancit canton or 555 tuna, palagi ganun ulam nila. Parents nya is buong araw tulog lang. Papasok papa nya sa work 7am-11am lang tas buong araw na tulog din. Then bahay nila ang baho kasi amoy tae ng pusaa 22 ba naman na pusa nandon sa kanila huhu. Then, ulam kasi nila di ako sanay kasi di ako sa ganun lumaki, sanay ako nag lluto mama ko talaga ng ulam. Then Nag work ako summerclass so may ipon ako. One time nag chat mama nya sakin then na bigyan ko daw muna bf ko pambaon sa school kasi daw kapos sila sa pera. ( itong time na to tinry ko talag ihelp sila kasi 1st bf ko sya e at mas angat buhay namin kesa sakanila). Then binigyan ko... Fast forward. Pangalawang kapatid ng bf ko babae is 1st yr college na at same kami ng  school nun. Then 2nd yr nako nun tas kapatid nya is gusto bilhin p.e uniform  ko. tas bigla narinig ng mama nya at ang sabi "" DAPAT KO DAW IBIGAY NALANG NG LIBRE P.E UNIFORM KO SA KAPATID NYA DAHIL BF KO NAMAN DAW KUYA NYA"".. ( sa isip isip ko binili ng parents ko yung p.e uniform ko sa halagang 850 pesos, tas gusto nya ibigay ko nalang ng libre?).Then fast forward, pinakilala ng kapatid nya bf nya, then sa kanila nag pa lisensya yung lalaki then after that parents nya, tita, tito nya tapos kapatid nya then bf nya nag coffee sila sa labas ng sila lang. ( SYEMPRE SA LOOB LOOB KO NAKAKASAMA NA DI MANLANG AKO OR KAMI INAYA NG BF KO, NA AKO NAUNA IPAKILALA OHH TAS DON PA SYA CLOSE). Tas fast forward, sa kwarto kami natambay ng bf ko( nandon din kapatid nya ) tapos di nmn kami sinasaway. Then mag 3 yrs na kami ng bf ko na ganun sitwasyon tas ngayon lang umangal mama nya na ""HINDI DAW NAMIN SILA NI RERESPETO"" at dapat daw sa terrace kami tumambay hindi sa kwarto, ( ayaw ng bf ko sa terrace dahil nga amoy tae ng pusa sobra 22 ba naman na pusa sa bahay nila dipa nag llinis ng tae jusko). Kami pa sinabihan na walang respeto, samantalaaa yung BF NG KAPATID NYA ISS, pumupunta nga sa kanila tapos uuwi ng 11:30pm ( sobrang gabi na yun ) then di nya masaway?? ayun nga walang respeto kasi hating gabi na di pa sya nauwi atsaka dapat nag papahinga na sila nun e tas di nya masabihan walang respeto yung lalaki na yun.
Tas bf ko nag oopen up sakin na problema nya sa pamilya ayan nga, mindset ng bf ko is need nya mag work para makaalis sa tirahan nila at mahelp parents nya dahil kapos sa pera, WHILE NAG AARAL SYA NG 4TH YR, nalaman ng mama nya yun then ayaw sya pag workin kesyo, ayaw daw mahirapan nya anak nya,makapag tapps daw muna sya  bago mag work. ganun tapos kapag di nag work bf ko late lagi sya nakakabayad ng tuition fee nya so meaning bumabagsak sya sa subject  dahil sobrang late enrollment nya dahil wala pambayad... Then ayun na nag work, nag kasweldo bf ko, una binigyan nya mama nya 2k( pang tulong sa bahay nila). Tapos nalaman ng bf ko pinang sshoppe lang ng parents nya binibigay.Then makalipas lang ilang araw wala pa next sweldo yung bf ko, nanghihingi mama nya agad sa kanya pambili lang daw ng gas nila binigyan ng bf ko 900 pesos, pero kwento sakin ng nanay nya 700 lang daw binigay at abonado pa daw syaa don. ( di alam ng bf ko  san na  punta pera binigay nya , kasi dapat daw nakakaluwag na sila dahil wala na ginagastos sa knya, wala na syang baon pera, tuition fee, tapos nag aabot pa sya tas may sweldo pa nmn papa nya so pano kakapusin yun ??). Pero pinag bigyan pa rin ng bf ko binigyan. Fast forward, nangutang mama nya sa knya 500 pesos sabi babayaran daw, pero ending hindi na binayaran talaga. Fast forward, nag try ako ipaintidi sa mama nya bakit need mag trabaho ng anak nya, then akala ko naiintindihan nya. after ilang days, pinagalitan nya bf ko about sa inopen up ko nararamdaman ng bf ko sa kanila para maintindihan nila. Tapos sabi daw ng mama nya sakin "" BAKIT DAW BF KO NAG TTIWALA SAKIN EH IBANG TAO DAW AKO AT BALANG ARAW DAW IS MAGBBREAK DIN  DAW KAMI, BAKIT DAW SYA NAG TTIWALA LUBOS SAKIN E DI DAW AKO NAG PAPAKAIN SA BF KO "". ( Uminit ulo ko kasi after all ng pamamalasakit ko sa kanila at paging mabuting tao tas ayan tingin nya pala..

1o1vw1m,https://i.redd.it/urcp1neyb0uf1.jpeg,I Think Someone Has Been Living in My House‚Ä¶ And I Just Found Proof.,"Okay, Reddit‚Ä¶ buckle up. I‚Äôm shaking as I type this. I live alone in a small, old house in the Midwest‚Äînothing fancy, just creaky floors and weird little noises that used to be funny. But lately‚Ä¶ not so much.

It started last Monday. I got back from the grocery store, dropped my keys on the hall table, took a shower. Later, I went to grab my towel from the bathroom hook. It was damp. I thought, okay, maybe I forgot to hang it properly yesterday. No big deal.

Tuesday, I noticed a mug with old coffee on the counter. I always wash my dishes the same day. That wasn‚Äôt mine. That night, while tidying the couch, I found a strand of long, thin brown hair stuck between the cushions. I have short hair. That wasn‚Äôt mine.

Wednesday, I checked the front door camera. No one had come inside. But at 3:02 AM, the hallway light turned on for about 8 seconds. Nothing showed up on the footage. I replayed it over and over. Sat on my living room floor. Trembled. Drank tea. Tried to sleep.

Thursday was worse. I woke up to sounds from the basement‚Äîdragging noises, like someone moving boxes. I pretended to sleep. At 9:30 AM, I went down. The basement door was slightly open. I always lock it. Inside, nothing major. Just footprints in the dust and a clean plate with crumbs‚Ä¶ crumbs I definitely didn‚Äôt put there.

Police came. They found nothing. ‚ÄúNo signs of forced entry,‚Äù they said. ‚ÄúProbably an animal.‚Äù Sure. I laughed, but my gut was screaming otherwise.

Saturday night, I woke at 2:17 AM to a wet, heavy breathing sound coming from the hall. My bedside lamp had a smudge on it. Not mine.

Then Monday‚Ä¶ I woke up feeling like someone had slept in my bed. My pillow was pressed in a way only memory foam could betray. Another strand of long hair. And on top of the blanket: a pencil note, messy, almost unreadable, saying: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt wake the hide.‚Äù My first thought: artistic, unsettling. My second thought: call a friend. My third: where the hell are the cameras?

I started recording obsessively. Placed my phone in the hall with the screen on. At 3:04 AM, a shadow moved across the living room. No face, just a thin outline. Sat on the rug, crossed its legs, gently touched the pillow beside it‚Ä¶ and disappeared into the basement. No exit through the front door.

I bought a cheap indoor camera. That night, sound of footsteps again. The camera caught it: no face, just a thin figure, sitting cross-legged on my rug. A finger traced my pillow gently, then gone.

Yesterday, someone‚Äîor something‚Äîleft a plastic bag outside my front door at 4:02 PM. Inside: three cookies and a note: ‚ÄúYou left the light on.‚Äù No footprints in the wet ground. No explanation.

And tonight‚Ä¶ I just looked at the basement door. A chair had appeared. New. Not mine. I‚Äôm leaving all lights on, cameras running, knife at my bedside. If I disappear‚Ä¶ please share this.

And to whoever‚Äîor whatever‚Äîis here‚Ä¶ be gentle with my coffee maker. I rely on it.",1,1759981284.0,u_BassTop4169,0,0.99,False

Wake up too early, rush through traffic, sit under fluorescent lights all day, then get home too drained to do anything but scroll and sleep.

Since going remote, everything feels different. I wake up rested. I make breakfast, actually taste my coffee, take short walks, even do laundry between meetings. I get more done and still have energy left after work.

But now I‚Äôve got a new problem. I have so much time and energy that I don‚Äôt even know what to do with it. I‚Äôm single, in my late twenties, no kids, so my days are super flexible and kind of all over the place. I feel like I‚Äôve been given a second life and I‚Äôm honestly a bit overwhelmed by it.

1o1vrji,https://www.reddit.com/r/BattleNetwork/comments/1o1vrji/megaman_battle_network_3_black_creepypasta_story/,MegaMan Battle Network 3 BLACK (Creepypasta Story),"Video games‚Ä¶ They‚Äôre great, frustrating, challenging, etc. There‚Äôs different genres as well. Everyone has their preferences, but for me, I prefer whatever catches my eye. Games like Super Mario Bros. Sonic the Hedgehog, the Classic Mega Man Games, hell even Indie games like Undertale, Five Nights at Freddy‚Äôs, the list goes on, and my style just changes at any given time. One series that hasn‚Äôt left me was the Mega Man Battle Network series, and by extension Star Force. I know, it‚Äôs not exactly the best series. BN1 and 2 were alright, 2 a bit better, but 4 was‚Ä¶ utter garbage in my opinion. 5 wasn‚Äôt all that different. 6 was definitely the best of that whole mess and a proper sendoff‚Ä¶ Kind of. Battle Network 3 though, was always my favorite. I liked the story more, not perfect, but it‚Äôs at least the best narrative in the franchise. That‚Äôs alright with me, I prefer the more realistic style that went above and beyond with the limitations they had to take into account. These games came out on the Game Boy Advance, but I also had the Legacy Collection on Steam. After a while, I felt burnt out of Mega Man as a whole. Nothing really happened, I just moved onto other things. I remember being obsessed with the Lan X Mayl, and MegaMan.EXE X Roll.EXE ships. That was a phase during that time, an embarrassing but not untrue phase. This isn‚Äôt what the story is about, but it does hold some relevance for later on. One evening, I was feeling rather bored, and decided to go out for a sweet treat at my local Starbucks. Needing the exercise, I walked to the Starbucks, and ordered a Large Venti Cookie Crumble, No Coffee, and Extra Whip Cream. They asked for my name, ‚ÄúChara‚Äù and I sat outside, looking at YouTube on my phone, watching something to pass the time.

For those curious as to why my name is Chara. No, this isn‚Äôt my real name, I prefer to keep my privacy, so for this story, you may call me ‚ÄúChara‚Äù an abbreviation of the word ‚ÄúCharacter‚Äù and yes it is pronounced like that. It‚Äôs actually funny considering there‚Äôs a character called Chara in Undertale, another series which I‚Äôm also a fan of. I even went as far as to buy the shirt on Fangamer, I felt connected to the character you could say. Regarding my brief background, I got my Game Boy Advance when I was a kid, and played a bunch of Game Boy games, like Super Mario Land 1 & 2, the Mario Advance Series, and even the Legend of Zelda A Link To The Past: Four Swords. It was a game I cried over, but over time, I came to appreciate it more as it was a gift from my grandfather. Unfortunately, I never had any Battle Network cartridges. It‚Äôs not like I needed any, I usually use emulators for games I wasn‚Äôt able to get my hands on. You guessed it, Battle Network was one of them. Since the Legacy Collection, I felt no need to emulate it, and only used emulation for other games. As I finished my drink, I started to walk back home. The sun was setting, and it was almost pitch black outside. On my way back, I noticed someone outside with a table and a bunch of stuff on it. It looked like a garage sale. I was curious as to why there was a garage sale before the sun was setting, but who knows? Maybe this was out earlier and I didn‚Äôt notice it. My neighbors are weird, man. I approached the woman running the stand, she simply greeted me, saying hello and told me to find anything she thought I was interested in. Curious, I looked through the items. They weren‚Äôt really anything of noteworthy. A couple boxes with random halloween masks, and some old bottles, wires, old clothes that looked raggedy, even books that didn‚Äôt really catch my interest. Oh wait, I guess there was a Darth Maul toy lightsaber, that looked like something I wanted to get my hands on. Aside from that, nothing much. One thing did peak my interest though. I saw something black sticking out, I grabbed it to get a closer look. It was a GBA Cartridge, turning it over I saw the game‚Äôs sticker. ‚ÄúMega Man Battle Network 3 BLACK‚Äù. It was a Battle Network game, not that I had been looking for one as I‚Äôve had the Legacy Collection on Steam. I was confused by the name though. Battle Network 3 BLACK? I‚Äôm aware the Japanese Version of BN3 BLUE was Battle Network: Rockman.EXE 3 BLACK in Japan, but then I came to the thought that maybe it was a fan-made English Translation of the Japanese Version. That thought alone made me smile. A real cartridge of one of my favorite games right in the palm of my hand. I was excited to try out the fan translation that could‚Äôve been on this cartridge, and pulled out my wallet to buy it. The woman spoke up and stopped me from taking out my money, saying that I can have it for free. I glanced at the Darth Maul Lightsaber and asked how much that was. She said it was 5 bucks, which was a really good deal. I pulled out a 5 dollar bill and a 1 dollar bill, one for the Saber and one for the game. I left it on the table and told her to keep the change. I know she said I could have the game for free, but I still wanted to leave her an extra dollar for it, just so I‚Äôd feel better about taking it. On top of that, I have a Darth Maul Lightsaber and a new game cartridge! It was a pretty good night, and felt pretty satisfied with my purchases from the garage sale. That night, I looked for my old Game Boy Advance SP I had when I was a kid, and pulled it into a charger and let it charge. To pass the time, I played with my new toy, and left the game on top of my bedside dresser, as well as played Sonic X Shadow Generations on Steam. As soon as it was done charging, it was nearly 11 in the evening, and I was excited to try out my new game I had purchased. Without any further notion, I inserted the game and turned it on.

The title screen appeared like how it did in the Japanese version, except the words were in English. ‚ÄúMega Man Battle Network 3 BLACK‚Äù It was then I realized that this was indeed an English Translation as I hit New Game. The words were in English just like in the Legacy Collection, only it seemed like the grammar was refined as I continued playing. I played through the first chapter, and went on the path of getting the license into the N1 Grand-Prix. I got some nice battle-chips to use, and I made my way through the first Chapter and beat FlashMan. There was something odd however. The Villain sequences that usually play in-between chapters didn‚Äôt play. It‚Äôs like the game just skipped them. Either way, I still had a great time. The game just resumed and I got the GutsMan V2 Battle-Chip. I know I should‚Äôve lost that battle to make Dex seem tough in front of his little brother, but I‚Äôm one of those people who just needs to give those a reality check. Real or fictional, it felt appropriate nonetheless. What took me by surprise is that Dex actually punched Lan in the face, making him fall to the ground, Dex ran off, and the girls, Mayl and Yai rushed to his aide asking if he was alright. Though the face portrait doesn‚Äôt show the sprite‚Ä¶ It looked like it had a tiny few pixels of blood on his face, like some kind of nosebleed. What the hell? This wasn‚Äôt in the original game, I thought to myself. Sure, Dex was a character who wanted to rival Lan, but he never resorted to violence like that before. In fact, none of the Battle Network games had him ever resort to violence after losing to a Net Battle. After that whole ordeal, I went to Sci-Lab and was given a SubPET to put MegaMan in later on. First, I had to get to the next exam on the Net for the next trial of the N1 Grand Prix. I finished it with ease, and I was ready for the next phase where the connection failed between Lan and MegaMan and I had to race out manually from where Lan jacked in. However, after the screen shook, the music stopped, and the textboxes had stopped. I checked the volume just to make sure I didn‚Äôt accidentally turn it down. It was all the way up, so‚Ä¶ What gives? Surprisingly, when I accessed my menu, I heard the sound effect that plays when you open and close it. So, the volume was working, but the music‚Ä¶ stopped. I walked around as MegaMan for a while, and I found no NPCs anywhere. It‚Äôs like they all‚Ä¶ Vanished. I couldn‚Äôt even talk to Lan anymore due to FlashMan‚Äôs Flash Bang that fucked up the PET. This wasn‚Äôt normal, usually you could still find NPCs and fight Viruses in this scenario, but to my dismay, I found no one. The screen turned to white, leading me into a virus battle. However, when the battle screen emerged, the game froze without spawning the viruses I had to fight with just the Buster, as I couldn‚Äôt access my chip folder without Lan present. However, the background was still moving, there were no viruses spawning. After a bit, a text box came up and said ‚ÄúBut Nobody Came. . .‚Äù The battle ended, sending me back to the overworld. That freaked me out as I read those words. It reminded me of Undertale‚Äôs No Mercy Route where if you kill a certain amount of monsters in one area, the next battle would tell you that phrase, but why was it playing here? I heard the soundtrack that would normally play after that message in my head. It didn‚Äôt come from the GBA speakers mind you. I tried to get back to where I initially had Lan Jack-In MegaMan, but to my dismay, that too was disabled. MegaMan‚Äôs text box came up, and had a different expression that I wasn‚Äôt accustomed to. He looked terrified, confused, like he had no idea what was going on. He didn‚Äôt say anything, just ‚Äú. . .‚Äù which I admit, I was confused too. Seeing MegaMan‚Äôs new portrait left me speechless, as that face portrait never originated in any of the Classic Battle Network games. I tried to get out of the text box, unfortunately I wasn‚Äôt able to. I left the area, and went back to the main network. Music finally started up, but it wasn‚Äôt the normal music that played. It was the Network is Spreading theme that usually played, only in reverse and‚Ä¶ Either slowed down or pitched down, I can‚Äôt remember. Then I saw something out of the corner of the pathway. It disappeared as soon as I saw it. Another random encounter occurred‚Ä¶ Music stopped, and the same thing as before happened. ‚ÄúBut Nobody Came. . .‚Äù Music continued after that. I saw that thing again, this time it stayed on screen and didn‚Äôt vanish off screen. It was one of those Heel Navis that are typically bad guys. Before approaching it, I wanted to save my game, just in case. When I tried to save, the game informed me that this was impossible. I was‚Ä¶ for a lack of better words, stunned. I was not able to save my game. I approached the Heel Navi cautiously. As soon as I reached him, he looked at MegaMan and a dialogue box popped up. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs looking for you. Better run while you can.‚Äù ‚Ä¶What? I was‚Ä¶ Confused. Who was looking for me? MegaMan‚Äôs face portrait appeared looking rather confused. The text box saying ‚Äú?‚Äù Like he didn‚Äôt know what the Navi meant. The text box wouldn‚Äôt close, no matter what I pressed. Considering the events that had taken place, I felt it was a sign to stop with this alternative path. I sighed and reset the game, wondering when my last save was.

The title screen booted up and I pressed continue. I was in control of Lan, strangely enough, this wasn‚Äôt all that surprising as I recall saving in the Overworld before Jacking-In, but the strange part was that MegaMan wasn‚Äôt present in my PET. More text as Lan expressed how worried he was for his Navi. A ring tone bursted the speakers as Lan‚Äôs PET rang. Lan answered it in a hurry, a text box of him saying ‚ÄúHello?!‚Äù Before the caller on the other end revealed themselves. It was Mayl. Mayl‚Äôs expression looked horrified, and her words made my blood run cold. ‚ÄúLan! Help! Someone‚Äôs in my house!! Come quick!!‚Äù The call was cut off with a girl screaming, without hesitation, I ran straight for Mayl‚Äôs house. When I got there, the lights were off, in a panic, I ran upstairs and found‚Ä¶ Something that made me disgusted. Mayl was on the ground, what looked like bruised marks on her face. Next to her was Dex, only‚Ä¶ Not exactly. The eyes of his sprite were a bright red, which made me cringe a little, but at the same time made me worried about what was going to happen next. Mayl screamed out ‚ÄúLan! H-He‚Äôs hurting me!‚Äù Before she could say another word, Dex grabbed Mayl and forcibly pulled her hair and screamed, Lan jumped in and shoved Dex off of her. Even going as far as punching him in the face, but in doing so‚Ä¶ A dialogue box with an enraged Dex portrait, said ‚ÄúYou have humiliated me for the last time, Lan Hikari!‚Äù Dex pulled a knife out of his pocket and stabbed Lan in the chest. Mayl screamed in horror, but Lan was still standing, and grabbed a nearby blunt object and hit his skull so hard, I heard a loud cracking sound. That made me jump, but I was more horrified at what the hell I saw. Mayl was up and holding Lan in her arms. In the background, as Mayl was grieving over Lan‚Ä¶ Some sort of black substance came out of Dex, and went onto the floor‚Ä¶ That and a mix of blood came out. I don‚Äôt know what I was looking at, but the black substance actually moved and went out of the room. Mayl was sobbing and shedding tears. The text box appeared, Mayl confessed. ‚ÄúI love you, Lan! Please. Stay with me!‚Äù Lan was in shock, but smiled after hearing that. ‚ÄúI lo-‚Äú Lan couldn‚Äôt finish his sentence, as his body dropped to the ground and he died. Mayl was grieving‚Ä¶ I hate to admit this‚Ä¶ But I actually teared up myself. I was about to shove the game off, when the screen faded to black and switched back to MegaMan. He wasn‚Äôt in the same place I was last time. He was in the Undernet area. I took back control and walked around. I was still processing everything that just went down, before a random encounter appeared‚Ä¶ Same thing as before‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúBut Nobody Came. . .‚Äù It was eerie at that point, because of the substance that came out of Dex. While walking around, I saw GutsMan and Roll together. They were just standing there, but immediately turned to MegaMan as I approached. Roll was the first to speak. ‚ÄúOh, Mega! Thank goodness you‚Äôre okay!‚Äù MegaMan was confused and asked ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù GutsMan answered, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know. All the Navis and even viruses haven't been showing up all day, and we lost contact with our Net OPs.‚Äù Roll said, ‚ÄúThey must be worried sick about us!‚Äù MegaMan recommended, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs stick together. Maybe we‚Äôll find a way back somehow.‚Äù The others nodded in agreement, and just like in‚Ä¶ Let‚Äôs say the Final Fantasy games, Roll and GutsMan walked in front of MegaMan and their sprites disappeared, signifying they‚Äôre part of the party. Now, if you don‚Äôt know, there are no party systems in the Battle Network games, aside from 5, but it‚Äôs complicated to explain right now. But, as I walked through the Undernet, I saw another Heel Navi. I approached it cautiously like before. It said ‚ÄúWhat are you doing here? This is a dangerous place, especially for us! Leave now before you get deleted!‚Äù Roll took offense to that. ‚ÄúHey, watch who you‚Äôre messing with, pal or you‚Äôll be deleted!‚Äù The Heel Navi responded ‚ÄúI‚Äôm being serious! It won‚Äôt be me that deletes you, it‚Äôll be IT.‚Äù ‚Ä¶What the hell was ‚Äúit?‚Äù I questioned myself. ‚ÄúRun for your lives! Find a safe place to hide!‚Äù The Heel Navi ran away, and I continued onwards. I eventually made it to where you first encountered FlameMan in the game. GutsMan commented, ‚ÄúThis is a dead end. Let‚Äôs go somewhere-‚Äú SLASH. The screen went to white, when it came back, MegaMan and Roll looked at GutsMan. He was sliced in half, before he exploded and disappeared. The black substance from before was there, it was frozen‚Ä¶ Roll actually grabbed MegaMan out of fear, terrified that a pile of goop wiped out their friend. The black substance started shapeshifting‚Ä¶ Into‚Ä¶ Hub Hikari! It was black and the eyes were just as red as the ones I saw with Dex. MegaMan started speaking ‚ÄúWho are you?!‚Äù ‚Ä¶No reply. It just stood there, staring. Roll started trembling. I did as well, feeling freaked out at what I was looking at. A dialogue box finally popped up and started to speak. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre here‚Ä¶ You‚Ä¶ I HATE YOU!‚Äù The shapeshifter slashed at MegaMan, Roll jumped in and got in the way. A sword was impaled in her chest. She looked horrified and coughed up what‚Ä¶ I could only assume it would be leaking data, which in a Navi‚Äôs case is basically bleeding out. MegaMan cried out, ‚ÄúROLL!!!‚Äù The shapeshifter spoke with a sinister grin on his face. ‚ÄúWhat a shame‚Ä¶ I would‚Äôve actually spared you.‚Äù MegaMan pointed his Buster at him, ‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶ YOU!!‚Äù The screen went white again, with a sword clash sound, it faded back and MegaMan‚Äôs arm was chopped off. ‚ÄúYou pathetic excuse of a Navi.‚Äù Roll barely could speak, but managed to pull some words out, ‚ÄúM-Mega‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry‚Ä¶ I failed to protect you. Just know in my heart‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve always loved you.‚Äù She exploded and was deleted. MegaMan got to his knees at that point. The screen went white again, and we were in a battle scene. The music playing‚Ä¶ Was a slowed down reverb version of the incident occurrence theme‚Ä¶ MegaMan was on his side of the field, his arm completely cut off, onto his knees. The shapeshifter resembling Hub Hikari, held a red bloodied knife with a sinister smile and stared at the blue boy. He spoke, ‚ÄùWhy? Why are you doing this?‚Äù The shapeshifter responded, ‚ÄúYou took everything from me. You took my life that should‚Äôve been mine. All of your friends, rivals, enemies, everyone you knew and loved‚Ä¶ all of them are now DEAD! You‚Äôll soon join them. This place may as well be your coffin, because you‚Äôre already dead! You hear that? YOU‚ÄôRE DEAD!‚Äù With no hesitation, it broke the rules and went onto MegaMan‚Äôs field, slashed him with his knife and deleted MegaMan right on the spot, killing him. The ‚ÄúMEGAMAN DELETED‚Äù text popped up and sent me to a game over screen like nothing happened. I think I started to understand. This wasn‚Äôt really Hub Hikari. This version of him was a monster, a pure evil, psychopathic, genocidal, murderous, monster. He killed every virus, all of his friends, all for the sake of revenge. So that‚Äôs how I interpreted it anyway. After I was sent back to the title screen, the continue option was gone. I turned off the GBA, and threw the cartridge in a fit of rage. I felt very strongly about the Battle Network series, and after this experience‚Ä¶ I decided to play some baseball. While my parents were asleep, I lit up the fireplace, grabbed my toy lightsaber, and the cartridge, and battered up. I ended up knocking it into the fire. I think I broke the game on the inside when it impacted the concrete. I tried to forget about that whole ordeal when I went to sleep.

Though, my thoughts shifted of Mayl being the only one left that was still alive, while everyone else she knew and loved died. I‚Äôll never know if that Psychotic Shapeshifter came back for her or not. And frankly, I don't know, and I don't care. It‚Äôs not like it matters now. The next day, I went to that house where the garage sale was the previous night. I knocked on the door and a man answered. I asked him about the garage sale the previous night. Though, he seemed perplexed, as if he didn‚Äôt know what I was talking about. I went on to tell him that there was a woman yesterday selling a bunch of stuff out here on his lawn. I described what she looked like, pale white skin, green eyes, a dazzling dress, and a silver necklace from what I recall her wearing. The man‚Äôs expression turned grim, saying that I described what his daughter looked like. She died near a lake and all that was recovered was a GBA cartridge which seems to have gone missing. He still has other things to remember her by, thankfully. I was in disbelief to hear this, as I was the one who burnt the cartridge the previous night. I thanked the man for his time and left as soon as possible. I‚Äôm still horrified at that whole experience seeing my beloved characters die the way they did. I‚Äôm not sure who that woman who sold me this game was, or what exactly her intentions were outside this man‚Äôs house. None of this makes any sense. But honestly? I‚Äôd rather I try not to make sense of it. I just want to forget about it.

I never did see that woman again. To this day, while I still love MegaMan Battle Network, I now just spend my time playing the Classic Sonic games, as well as Minecraft and the new Deltarune chapters. However, the night after that experience, for a few weeks‚Ä¶ Every night. In my dreams, I see red eyes and a red smile, staring right at me‚Ä¶ With a bloodied knife in its hands, waiting for the perfect moment‚Ä¶ To strike me down.",0,1759980839.0,BattleNetwork,0,0.5,False

I donated anonymously to the classroom fund earlier this year ($700).

I‚Äôm just worried that some parents might still bring individual gifts and it will look like I didn‚Äôt get her anything.

1o1vnbc,https://i.redd.it/jp58rul890uf1.png,"Husband Said He's Faithful? Alexa, Play the Cheating Receipts!","The second day of my husband's business trip, I was cleaning at home when I casually said to our smart speaker: ""Alexa, play some music.""

The next second, a strange, coquettish female voice came from the speaker.

""You little moonbeam, Tina, is happy to serve you\~ Kiss kiss Adrian, what song would you like to hear?""

I froze completely. Adrian? That's my husband. Tina? Who was that?

I immediately called my husband: ""Did you mess with the smart speaker at home?""

He paused briefly on the other end, then said nonchalantly: ""Oh, some friends came over a few days ago, probably connected one's account. Why?""

I said it was nothing with a smile, hung up, then hailed a cab straight to the company my husband had been frequenting lately.

Apparently, he wasn't just frequenting the company‚Äîhe might have been frequenting someone else's bed too.

The cab stopped outside ""Stellar Designs.""

I looked up‚Äî

The glass facade gleamed blindingly in the sunlight, just like the company's aggressive rise in the industry over the past two years.

Our main competitor at ""Dream Build"" Design Studio.

The receptionist was totally professional‚Äîdidn't give me attitude even though I was literally the boss of their rival company. Just did her job and made the call.

A few minutes later, this girl in a white dress came hurrying out, looking all clean and innocent.

Tina Morgan.

The second she saw me, her eyes went deer-in-headlights for a split second, but she recovered quick and put on this shy little smile.

""Hi there, can I help you with something?""

""The smart speaker thing,"" I said straight up, keeping my voice level while I studied her face. ""Login records show it was your account.""

""Oh, that speaker!"" She looked like a lightbulb went off, then got all sheepish and scratched her head.

""A few days ago, Mr. Carter hosted a design symposium at home, and I was there. I might have logged in and played some background music then. I'm so sorry for any trouble this caused you!""

Smooth as silk.

Covered her tracks while still playing the sweet, clueless act.

If I didn't know Adrian's personality, I might've actually bought it.

But he's way too controlling and paranoid to let some random woman log into our home devices with her personal account.

My gaze slowly moved from her picture-perfect innocent face down to her delicate wrist.

There was a silver bracelet.

Two irregular circles interlocked, with a tiny letter ""A"" engraved on one of them.

I'd designed it myself last year for our wedding anniversary. Had my jeweler friend craft it as a gift for Adrian.

A, for Adrian.

One of a kind in the entire world.

Tina noticed me staring and instinctively started to hide her hand behind her back.

I smiled and stepped closer, my tone almost gentle. ""That's a gorgeous bracelet. From your boyfriend? He's got great taste.""

Her face went white as a sheet. Her lips trembled, but not a single word came out.

That was all I needed.

I didn't spare her another glance as I turned and walked away.

The second I got in the Uber, I speed-dialed my girl Vivian‚Äîthe best divorce attorney in town.

She picked up with her usual loud-ass voice.





""Well, well, if it isn't the famous designer Savannah! Finally! The busy bee remembers I exist!""





""I need a favor."" My voice scary calm.





""Look into someone for me. Tina Morgan, intern at Stellar Designs. And I want everything on Adrian from the past six months‚Äîevery transaction, every hotel booking, every damn receipt. Don't miss a thing.""





Vivian went quiet for a beat, then dropped the playful tone. ""...We going scorched earth?""





""Worse than that.""





I hung up. The car fell silent.





Within minutes, Adrian was calling me back.





I stared at ""Hubby"" on my screen, feeling sick at how ironic it looked. Took a deep breath before answering.





""Sav, what's wrong?"" His voice was smooth as always, with just the right amount of concern.





""Vivian came by the studio to help you check on some things? Are you running into trouble at work?""





Look at that‚Äîhe'd already planted his spies in the company so early.





I swallowed the rage bubbling up inside and used my most normal voice.





""It's nothing, I couldn't get away, so I had her pick up a contract for me... When are you coming back? I miss you so much.""





He seemed to relax on the other end, then gave that warm laugh I used to love.





""On, my silly girl. I miss you too. Soon as I wrap up this project, I'm flying straight home to you, my little moonbeam.""





My little moonbeam...





Those three words hit my ears like a slap.





My grip on the phone went white-knuckle tight.





Chapter 2





Vivian's crazy efficient.





Half an hour later, my phone buzzed.





A link with her commentary:





\[Year's best two-faced bitch performance, complete with bulletproof evidence chain. Enjoy the show.\]





I clicked through to Tina's Instagram‚Äîpublic profile, of course.





Her latest post was a close-up of her wrist wearing my one-of-a-kind A bracelet, captioned:





\[Moonbeam racing toward you, Mr. A.\]





My ""moonbeam"" pet name, my custom bracelet‚Äînow they were some other woman's trophies.





I kept scrolling, my face stone cold.





One photo showed our home office in the background, Tina making a cutesy face while surrounded by the rare architecture books I'd collected from Italy.





\[Soaking up knowledge in Mr. A's study‚Äîfeeling inspired!\]





Another featured her holding a fountain pen over design sketches‚Äîmy 30th birthday gift to Adrian, limited edition collaboration piece.





\[Mr. A's pen writes like a dream. He says my hands deserve only the finest.\]





And there was our usual date spot, that restaurant we loved, with all my favorite dishes on table.





\[Secret hideaway with Mr. A. He says I'm his only safe harbor.\]





Every photo, every word was a surgical strike on my most precious memories.





Until I got to the post from three days ago.





Tina was holding printed design drafts, looking smug as hell.





Caption read:





\[Mr. A stayed up all night perfecting this for me. He says I'm the most naturally gifted designer he's ever met, totally going to nail the 'Skyline Center' project. Let's do this!\]





Skyline Center?





The project our Dream Build team had poured everything into for six months. The biggest milestone of my career.





I shot up from the couch and grabbed my car keys.





The office was empty at midnight. I used my fingerprint to get in and went straight to Adrian's office.





His computer was still on, showing our wedding photo as the screensaver‚Äîhim smiling all tender and loving.





Made me want to puke.





I tapped the keyboard and got the password prompt.





Tried my birthday‚Äîwrong.





Our anniversary‚Äînope.





I let out a bitter laugh and typed in Tina's birthday.





""Welcome back.""





His desktop was neat and organized. I spotted the encrypted folder right away and opened it to find our complete Skyline Center proposal‚Äîmonths of blood, sweat, and tears from me and my team.





Right next to it sat another folder, labeled with just one letter: T.





I clicked it open. The proposal inside was almost identical to ours, except for subtle tweaks to key structural elements and design highlights. Just enough changes to dodge patent issues while keeping all the brilliant core concepts.





The signature at the bottom: Tina Morgan.





He wasn't just cheating on me.





He was stealing my life's work, my company's future!





All to build his mistress a golden ladder to fucking success!





My stomach lurched violently.





I gripped the cold desk edge to keep from collapsing.





Turns out jealousy and betrayal really can twist a man beyond all recognition.





Chapter 3





The Skyline Center bidding conference was packed.





I found a corner seat where I could watch without being noticed as Stellar Designs' representative took the stage.





Tina, naturally.





She'd traded her innocent white dress for a sharp business suit, hair in a sleek updo, makeup flawless.





Gone was the sweet little lamb act‚Äînow she looked every inch the ambitious executive.





She took a deep breath and launched into her presentation.





""My design concept springs from the idea of 'the city's eye.' We don't want just another cold building, but a living entity that breathes with the city, witnessing its growth and evolution...""





Every single word was something I'd said to Adrian during countless late nights, fueled by coffee and passion, thinking we were sharing the deepest creative connection.





I thought those were our most intimate moments of understanding.





Turns out it was just my solo performance, and he was the world's most patient thief.





The cherry on top?





Adrian was sitting with the panel as a special guest judge.





Perfectly tailored suit, every hair in place‚Äîthe exact polished look I knew so well.





He was listening intently, nodding along, looking at Tina with this light in his eyes I'd never seen before.





Like she was precious treasure he couldn't wait to show off to the world.





He completely ignored me in the corner, like I was just part of the furniture.





My phone suddenly buzzed with a text from Vivian.





\[Want me to show up with a baseball bat?\]





Looking at the screen, my tense expression softened slightly at her humor.





I texted back: \[Stand by.\]





On stage, Tina hit her stride, the PowerPoint showing the final renderings‚Äîstolen directly from my computer.





The audience murmured in appreciation.





When she finished, the applause was thunderous.





The host took the mic. ""Thank you, Miss Morgan, for that incredible presentation. Now let's hear from our special guest judge, Adrian Carter from Dream Build Design Studio, for his expert commentary.""





The microphone passed to Adrian.





He cleared his throat, his gaze landing on Tina with unmistakable warmth.





""Honestly, I'm blown away.""





""Miss Morgan's design perfectly balances artistic vision with practical function, especially those bold structural modifications. Incredibly innovative, incredibly inspired.""





There was that word again. Inspired.





The same word he'd used to describe Tina, the same word meant to cut me down.





He paused, scanning the room.





""This work is, without question, today's clear winner.""





The applause erupted again, even louder than before.





In that moment, my world went dead silent except for my heart hammering against my ribs.





The host beamed. ""Thank you, Mr. Carter! Looks like Stellar Designs has this locked up! Any other guests or judges have questions for Miss Morgan?""





Crickets.





After Adrian's expert seal of approval, there wasn't much left to question.





Tina bowed on stage, practically glowing with triumph.





I pocketed my phone and stood up just as everyone prepared for another round of applause.





Small movement, but it caught every eye in the room.





The host blinked. ""Ma'am, and you are...?""





Adrian looked at me, his smile froze solid.

I awoke to the sound of a concerned wife tapping my shoulder. She said I started to scream and she got worried. I thanked her. I gave her a long embrace and kissed her. She knew I would be gone for at least a day. You see the road through the Beartooth mountains gets shut down during winter. You need special access in order to get through and even then, the trip has to be made with extreme caution. Luckily from the looks of the address John provided on the note, it isn‚Äôt all the way by Cody Wyoming. We can go through Red Lodge and get there in two and a half hours. I told her the combination to the gun safe and told her to be safe. I am not sure why I felt the need but maybe it was the nature of my dream. I won‚Äôt have any service up in those mountains. As soon as I shut the door I wanted to go back in, but I stopped myself. I just wanted this mess to be over. I wanted to go to sleep at night without these dreams. Would I make it down that mountain? Once I find John's kid, I am done with Billings, and I am done with this job. I said a quick prayer in my car, then left to pick up Carson and Red.

The trip was a quiet one. Red for obvious reasons but even Carson looked shaken up. I think we all wanted peace. The only way to do that was to talk to Paco and build some evidence. Despite the horror of my nightmares I will not chalk up these murders to something supernatural. All the horrors I have ever seen came from man, and man alone. It‚Äôs not our job to take life. I catch the bad men, they go to jail for life. That's when God passes his judgment. I am just a man, who catches worse men. It couldn‚Äôt be anything else.

We finally made it to the Cabin. Red led us to the door and knocked. He said something in Crow tongue but I couldn‚Äôt possibly say what. Then an older gentleman from inside the home responded. He opened the door slowly and peaked. Red said,

‚ÄúAre you Paco, sir?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes I am, what is this?‚Äù

‚ÄúSir, my name is detective Ralph Irons. This is my partner Carson. We were hoping to get some answers and information on a murder that took place sixteen years ago. You se‚Äì.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou need to leave now for your own good!‚Äù Paco shouted.

	Then, like clockwork, as if he triggered it with his warning, the most heavy blizzard of the winter hit the Bear Tooths. Begrudgingly Paco told us to get inside. He told us at minimum it would be two days before we could leave based on how heavy this blizzard looked to be. I guess I didn‚Äôt notice it from the outside but entering the warm cabin, all the windows were boarded up. A fire was going and Paco said he would start making dinner for us. Paco was a short man, maybe 5‚Äô7, with a stocky build and a mustache, he was missing an ear.  He looked to be in his late 60‚Äôs and ever since we got to the cabin, he's had a cig in his mouth. It reminded me of how bad I wanted a smoke. I asked Paco if it‚Äôs okay for us to smoke while we waited for dinner and he said bluntly, in a passive tone:

‚ÄúDo what ya like‚Äù

So then I demanded Carson pass me a smoke. Luckily it did crack a smile out of him. I punched him asking if he was okay and that I was worried about him.

‚ÄúYeah I‚Äôm good man, just had a weird dream is all, didn‚Äôt get good sleep.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat was your dream about?‚Äù I asked concerningly.

‚ÄúYou died.‚Äù Carson said quietly.

	Before I could respond, Red walked up and also demanded Carson bummed a cig. Carson groaned and passed him one. Soon the four of us in that cabin hot boxed the place with cig smoke. It was the best buzz of my life. After some small talk and cheap laughs, Paco brought out some whiskey. Paco spoiled us. He cooked up some elk steak with twice baked potatoes. Between the dinner, the whiskey, and the smoke, I for the first time wasn‚Äôt thinking about my job. The four of us started talking about war stories. Worst things we‚Äôve seen. Paco started. I asked Paco about the murder sixteen years ago and he said he would need a lot more whiskey before he retells it. He called this one, a warm up. 

Paco dealt with backlash from friends and even family about becoming tribal police. In some reservations, if you try to leave you are seen as betraying your family. In some reservations, if you work for the government you‚Äôre a ‚Äúsell out‚Äù. There is a significant level of self hatred amongst the reservations. His home was vandalized often. He said it  was his second year as a cop. He recounted the time he and his mentor Trent Fala were investigating human trafficking within the tribe. 

‚ÄúI was new to the job. Despite some of the backlash, I could bear it. We got some calls about more women going missing around the reservation. We subsequently conducted multiple stake outs surveilling different homes. Around that same time, I thought I was in love with a woman named Cheyenne, and went on a couple dates. Massive bosom, shared a bed on multiple occasions.‚Äù Paco said, which got a few chuckles and hollers from the three of us listening closely.

‚ÄúOne night she asked me about my job, what was happening. I told her, the women in the tribe were being hunted and I was gonna put an end to it. I told her where me and Trent were investigating that night. Trent and I went on another stake out for a home we knew moved drugs and suspected, moved women. Around 3 AM Trent woke me up and pointed towards the house. Two white vans pulled in, then before I could process it, the sliding doors opened and bullets sprayed in the air at me and Trent. Trent was riddled right away and I was hit in the upper pectoralis and they blew off this ear. I stumbled out of the car and started firing back and called for backup. I was able to hold out, miraculously. Trent wasn‚Äôt so lucky. When the adrenaline started to wear out, my mind slowed and I processed what just happened. Cheyenne sold us out. She was part of it. Nobody else knew what we were doing besides Trent, myself, and her. Never tried my hand at love again. My friend was dead. The ring was put to rest. The woman I thought belonged to me, locked up.‚Äù Paco ended his tale.

	The room fell silent. He told us not to pity him with a laugh of great gusto and said ‚ÄúNext, Next!‚Äù Carson and I sat and looked at each other.

‚ÄúWell you go ahead, you‚Äôve been in homicide longer than me. Anything I got is what you got too‚Äù Carson said to me.

‚ÄúFine fine, I‚Äôll go next.‚Äù I proclaimed before swigging more whiskey down my gullet. Keenan‚Äôs face popped in my head.

‚ÄúIt was my first year in homicide. I‚Äì‚Äù

	Before I could continue, slow, methodical, hard banging slammed at the cabin door. We all looked around. 

‚ÄúIgnore it, the storm plays tricks. Nobody could navigate themselves out here. Any human would have immediately locked themselves away once they saw the snow.‚Äù Paco assured.

‚ÄúHelp me. I‚Äôm scared. "" A child pleaded from behind the door. A young boy.

	At that instant Red jumped from his chair and with an intensity, headed to the door. Paco yelled at him to stop. All Red said in the return was.

‚ÄúIt's my nephew.‚Äù

	Paco pleaded with Red, that it wasn‚Äôt who was at the door but it was pointless. Red opened the door, the wind from the snow slammed the door inside the cabin and kept it there. There was no child. Nothing was visible besides two thin, wrinkled poles that were longer than the door itself. Large grey blood stained feet were all Red saw then he looked down at what he hoped would be his nephew. Then it happened. The moment I finally knew, some monsters weren't manmade. The root of my nightmares lately. Before we could process, She or it bent down, her saggy tietze dropped down just above her knees and there it was. Her face. An elongated blood stained snout, thinned black hair, and red eyes. Eyes that were darting all around stalking Her prey. It all happened so fast. Red‚Äôs head was enveloped with the same rows of teeth as the tooth at the crime scene. She brought her head back outside and stood straight up. All that was visible of Red was his feet dangling in the air. He was screaming, then She chomped down. Red‚Äôs decapitated corpse fell to the ground and was the first of us to stain the snow blood red.



**PART SIX:**

Paco screeched to shut the door as went for his pistol. He shot three rounds towards Her. only one connected her shin as Carson slammed the door shut. I was frozen. 

‚ÄúWhat the fuck was that? Reds fucking dead!‚Äù Carson yelled.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know? I thought since you came up here to ask me about sixteen years ago you knew what She is?‚Äù Paco replied.

‚ÄúWe thought it was just some sick murder‚Äù I replied, trying to remain calm. The three of us had our pistols out. Waiting.

‚ÄúNo, She torments the crow tribe. The Red Woman. It‚Äôs why I quit my job to move out here. Once I got involved, she never gave me peace. All I have been doing ever since is try to do research on Her.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs there anything we can do? I saw you shot it, can She be killed?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúTo my knowledge, She cannot die. She was given power from dark forces. Story goes she belonged to a rival tribe, Crow fighters ambushed during winter. Killed everyone, including her child. She was revived and has punished us ever since. There are rumors though, if we know her name She will leave us.‚Äù

Just as he said that something hit the roof of the cabin. She was crawling atop us.

‚ÄúDo you have any idea what Her name could be?‚Äù I asked.

Paco grabbed a book and started flipping through the pages before stating:

‚ÄúLisaxp√∫a‚Äì‚Äù

A shot rang. Carson shot Paco. Carson looked terrified. 

‚ÄúWhat the fuck did you do?!‚Äù I yelled.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt move on my own, I didn‚Äôt mean to. Help me!‚Äù Carson replied in horror.

	I started towards Paco then ‚ÄúCRACK‚Äù, everything went dark.

	I woke up walking up to a house that looked all too familiar. My first homicide case. ‚ÄúNo, don't take me back here, I don‚Äôt want to see it again please‚Äù I thought. I had no control over my movement. I couldn‚Äôt close my eyes. In 2017 I was 28 years old. I was with the man I was replacing, Josh Peck. Josh was retiring that summer and was training me on the job. We got called because neighbors on Burlington Street reported screaming and a gun shot. We were informed that the house belonged to an Everette Blanc, his wife Julie Blanc, and their 8 year old autistic son, Keenan. I never forgot their names. I never forget any of the names. I was back there, walking up with Josh. Pistols drawn, we walked in and there it was. Everette shot Julie in the head, and was wailing on his son Keenan with a box cutter. Over and over and over and over. ‚ÄúSTOP, STOP, STOP IT! WHY ARE YOU SHOWING ME THIS AGAIN PLEASE GOD STOP THIS‚Äù I pleaded in my mind. So much noise within my psyche but just silence. Over and over and over and over he kept smashing down on Keenan. 

‚ÄúThe boy wouldn‚Äôt stop screaming, he wouldn‚Äôt stop screaming. Screaming and screaming and screaming! That cunt right there wouldn‚Äôt let me get rid of him once we found out his condition. She brought this on herself.‚Äù Everett said while still calmly bringing the box cutter down on Keenan‚Äôs sunken face.

	Josh noticed Everett had the handgun on the coffee table next to him and Josh dived for it. It happened so fast, Josh grabbed the gun, and shot Everett in the temple. In horror I looked at Josh. Josh wiped the gun and placed it in Everett‚Äôs hand. He looked at me and said:

‚ÄúWe tried to stop him, talk him down. He killed himself to escape justice.‚Äù



	I was new to the job. It was the only job that the suspect was there committing the crime while I was present. I was shaking. Josh grabbed me and punched me.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôre you gonna say boy?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe tried to talk him down, he pulled the trigger when we got here.‚Äù

 I really am a coward. My child will know his father as a coward. I never wanted kids after that. I was always so afraid. Afraid that I‚Äôd fuck the kid up or hurt them. Khalyn changed that in me. She‚Äôs so good. I‚Äôm just afraid I‚Äôm no good, no good for her, for this job, or for my kid. 

I never thought I was going to have to relive that. Then Josh turned blank, letting me go. This wasn‚Äôt what happened next. Then without a moment's hesitation my body started walking to the back door. When I opened the door I took a step and fell. I hit the snow hard. I was back to this never ending nightmare. The infant wasn‚Äôt there this time. This time it was Keenan. His sunken face in my lap. This poor boy. The culmination of my fear was causing the blood to flow in the snow. I looked up and there the Red woman stood still. The choir resumed its cursed melody. More voices than the last time. The three children with the infant, Carson, Kim, John, Red, Riggs, Captain Beck, Khalyn, Paco, Everett, Julie all joined the choir. Covered in blood they sang. They all danced to the melody of this witch and spread the blood throughout the white powder. 



‚ÄúListen, child of the plains and sky‚Äî

When the night turns red, don‚Äôt open your eye.

She walks the edge of the living and dead...

They call her The Red Woman ‚Äî

And her path is blood-red.



Oh, Red Woman, fire-born shade,

Haunter of silence, the forest afraid.

She dances through nightmares, she sings in your ear,

A shriek in the stillness, a hunger for fear.



They say she was mortal, a girl left to die,

Abandoned in snow with a scream to the sky.

Her heart turned to cinders, her soul split in two‚Äî

Now she walks with the wolves... and they howl when she‚Äôs through.



Crow child, run when her red eyes gleam,

She walks without sound, she slips through your dream.

If she calls from the dark of the cottonwood tree,

Your voice will be lost, and your bones will be free.



She whispers your name when the firelight's low,

Her fingers are smoke, her footsteps are snow.

Some say she flays you, some say she feeds‚Äî

But none who have seen her return from the reeds.



Oh, Red Woman, curse and flame,

A shadow etched deep in the Crow tribe‚Äôs name.

She roams through the blizzards, with blood on her breath,

Bringing silence and sorrow and beautiful death.



Hush now, child... don‚Äôt follow the cry.

When the stars go out, and the wind runs dry...

She waits in the cold, where the last light bled.

They call her the Red Woman...

And her path is blood-red.‚Äù

‚ÄúNO NO NO, STOP IT PLEASE. ENOUGH SINGING! IM SORRY. PLEASE IM SORRY.‚Äù I screamed.

	They did not stop. They just kept repeating. My wife walked out to me. Still singing. I turned around and the Red Woman was just walking slowly this time. I turned back to my wife and she arrived where I sat. Still singing. 

‚ÄúHoney what‚Äôs going on?‚Äù I pleaded, hoping for an answer.

She stopped singing momentarily and said softly:

‚ÄúOur path doesn‚Äôt have to be blood red‚Äù 

She turned back and walked away past the choir and into the blizzard out of sight. The choir still singing, still dancing. 

‚ÄúWhat? What does that mean, babe? Don‚Äôt leave me please!‚Äù I begged.

She did not look back. I was left there with Keenan‚Äôs corpse. I looked up and there she was. My first real look at her but things were different. She wasn‚Äôt as tall as I once saw her. She was just a young girl, probably 20ish. Normal. The red blood stained snout, the long skinny limbs, the eyes, gone. Covered in blood. A long slice down her buffalo skinned clothing around the stomach. She appeared pregnant. She looked down at Keenan then back at me. She offered her hand out. She wanted Keenan.

‚ÄúWhat do you want with him? What do you do with the children? ANSWER ME!‚Äù I pleaded.

‚ÄúYou will never know.‚Äù She replied.

No malice, no hatred, just stated as a fact. She grabbed Keenan and turned around. She walked into the blizzard. The choir followed her, opposite of where Khalyn went. The woman's silhouette changed and it looked like she was holding the hand of Keenan. The choir slowly danced into the blizzard out of sight.



Then I woke up.



**PART SEVEN:**

I awoke on the cold hardwood floor of Paco‚Äôs cabin. Carson was sat on the ground shaking and crying. I looked up and Paco was shot in the chest. He was dead. He died with his gun in his hand. A brave man through and through. I walked over to his corpse, maneuvered his hand and shot his pistol five times towards the front door where Carson and I were in relation to his body when I passed out. Carson looked scared and confused. I walked to him, grabbed him by the shirt and punched Carson. 

	‚ÄúPaco killed those women, you hear me. He refused to tell us where the body of those kids went but he admitted to their murder. He knocked me out when we walked in, he tied you up, and he sawed Red‚Äôs head off. We got free and he pulled his gun on us.‚Äù

	‚ÄúWhat, no! I have to own this Ralph. I killed a good man. What about that thing we saw?‚Äù

	‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry Carson. Nobody will understand.‚Äù I said solemnly. I looked outside and the blizzard ended.

	‚ÄúShe let us live. It isn‚Äôt our business to understand why, or what this is all about. I have a child on the way, I am just gonna focus on being a good parent for them.‚Äù

It was another day while we were trapped up that mountain. We brought Paco and Red‚Äôs bodies back and told our fictitious tale. They believed it. I told Kim the tooth was just a keepsake of John‚Äôs family. With no other witnesses around, no suspects, the department found their scapegoat. I am sorry Paco. Truly. Khaylyn and I moved away from Billings. I quit the force. Carson took over. We live in some small town on the outskirts of nowhere. I am officially a father now. While I still get scared that I will fuck the kid up, I know that I will never be like Everett. That kid reminds me that although there are monsters in this world; Manmade or not, there is still good. So I am sorry Carson, I am gonna have to disagree with you. God isn‚Äôt dead. I see proof of his existence every single day.

1o1vmbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1o1vmbt/i_work_in_it_and_practically_play_games_all_day/,I work in IT and practically play games all day.,"Hi all, so I have a real cushy IT job in an incredibly fancy office for a big billion dollar company ( won‚Äôt say what for privacy sakes of course ) i earn quite a lot of money, and I‚Äôm in charge of the ENTIRE office, an office with 100+ people and computers to look after.

I get free lunch with the company, free coffee / tea whenever I want, and free fruit available all day. 

I only do about 1 hour - 2 hours or actual work a day, the rest of the time I spend playing games on my phone / scrolling reddit, sometimes I‚Äôll spend a couple hours drawing pictures, and very rarely, outside contract work ( like getting paid to get paid by another job ‚Ä¶ ) 

One time someone even ‚Äúcaught‚Äù me drawing instead of working, they loved it so much they asked me for a commission for $300 LOL. 

Sometimes if I get over games or reddit, I‚Äôll just go for a walk or take a nap in the server room, I have teams on my phone so if anything does go down I just say ‚ÄúHi I am available now, I can assist‚Äú or I‚Äôll just guide the user to a solution, to which no one has questioned ( apparently I still do things faster then the previous guy ) 

But here‚Äôs is the thing, and I‚Äôm not joking when I say this, 90% of issues people present to me, magically start working as soon as I look at their computer, and never happen again. 

There is a running joke now going through the office that I have a ‚Äúmagic techno aura‚Äù my very presence somehow fixes IT issues. 

The big boss needed a charger ‚ÄúI have meeting soon and I need that charger‚Äù 

‚ÄúNo probs boss !‚Äù Problem is there aren‚Äôt any spares left, but of course, as soon as the boss asks ? Another employee approaches me

‚Äúhi I had this charger at home, but no longer need it, here you go‚Äù 

Sweet, ‚Äúhey boss man, got you that charger!‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks mate, legend, this office wouldn‚Äôt be the same without you‚Äù 

How on earth has no one noticed ? I‚Äôve been doing this for over 10 years. 

I‚Äôm starting to think office work is 90% ‚Äúsmile and wave boys, smile and wave‚Äù 
I‚Äôm pretty good at socialising, quite good looking, i dress well, and say hey / engage in conversation / joke around with everyone, and everyone seems to think I‚Äôm this genius IT man, when the majority of time actually working is plugging shit in cus someone knocked it loose with their foot, or server maintenance every so often. 

If this keeps up I‚Äôm going to start believing I have legit magic computer powers, the issues ‚Äújust fixing themselves in my presence‚Äù thing has happened 4 times in a row today in alone. 

I‚Äôm at work right now, someone even came and asked for help as I am typing this and thought I was doing something important ( I did stop to assist and Lo and behold, the issues ‚Äúmagically‚Äù stopped happening in my presence lol ) 

Who knows maybe they do know I do hardly anything and they just like having me around ?

	After a banana, morning coffee, and a kiss to my wife I was out the door. She tried asking more about baby stuff but I just couldn‚Äôt talk about it, there was a job to be done and in all honesty, I have been avoiding the subject. How could the tooth belong to someone from that long ago? Was the tooth a namesake of John's family? I am unfamiliar with Native American customs when it comes to holding on to something like teeth. Maybe it was a way to honor their ancestors. Too many questions and not enough answers. When I arrived Carson was waiting outside the department for me. We walked in together. He was rubbing his eye.

‚ÄúHow are you able to drink as much as you do and not call out of work?‚Äù Carson asked.

‚ÄúI think my dads side of the family was Scottish or Irish"" I replied with a wink. Which was bullshit because to my knowledge I am mostly Welsh and English. Who cares, same island.

‚ÄúThat would explain your idiocracy, you make your ancestors proud‚Äù Carson giggled with immediate regret as I could tell his head cracked from it.

	When we got to forensics Kim came up to me looking a bit shaken. I asked her to see what was going on but she was inconsolable. Kim was a 66 year old woman who chain smoked. Worked for BPD for 30 years, a true rock in the department. I never thought I would see the day where she was shaken up by a piece of evidence. All she said to us was ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gone.‚Äù

	When we tried to press her as to what she meant she finally clarified. According to Kim the tooth was in more or less good condition. Besides the blood on it, not a single mark or erosion was indicated when we brought it to her the night before. Kim went on to state as soon as she radiocarbon dated the tooth and got the results it dissolved in front of her eyes. She had never seen anything like it before.

	So now we were left with no evidence left. Only knowledge that the tooth existed to begin with and how old it was dated to. Kim stated she would stand under oath and swear to the tooth's existence once we caught the suspect. I thanked her for her work and told Kim to get some rest. Carson and I took our leave.

‚ÄúSo now what?‚Äù Carson asked.

‚ÄúLet's pay John a visit. Maybe he‚Äôs got some ideas.‚Äù I replied.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt even know if the tooth had anything to do with the murder or the kid's disappearance.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe, but remember the way the wounds looked on Natalie? Or Tallulah Birdinground from two weeks ago? We thought a hack saw was the weapon but couldn't it also look like biting? I mean you saw the tooth right? The thing was sharp to the touch and it certainly didn‚Äôt feel like it was 400 years old.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell I guess we got nothing else going for us‚Äù. Carson said in an annoyed tone.

Carson is relatively fresh to homicide. He started about two years ago and has been my partner since his first day. I am three years older than Carson so the partnership has truly been more of a friendship and outside of my wife and immediate family, I am unsure if I consider anyone closer to me than Carson. However, Carson is impatient, and the job has taken a toll on him like it would any sane person. Although Carson is only three years younger than me I started homicide when I was 28, I am 36 now. I have been in this game far longer and after a while, with enough compartmentalization, the job becomes nothing more than that, a job. It can‚Äôt be anything else or you go mad. Right now for Carson, it‚Äôs everything.



I called John and he gave us the address of his brother Red‚Äôs house. When we arrived we were greeted by a scrawny 20 something year old. It was John‚Äôs brother Red. Red told us he would be back in an hour and he was going to take the opportunity to run to the store while we were here. He has been unable to leave John out of his sight in fear John would kill himself. We said we would hang here until he returned and he thanked us.

‚ÄúWas there really nothing other than her torso? Natalie was practically my sister, I never thought something like this could happen to her, someone so good.‚Äù Red asked quietly.

‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm real sorry. We‚Äôll find the bastard that did this.‚Äù I answered

‚ÄúThanks, anyway I‚Äôll try to make it quick, we can talk more when I get back.‚Äù Red left in a hurry.

	When we entered the home the smell of booze stung the nostril. While Red was able to hold John back from killing himself, it was apparent he couldn‚Äôt keep him away from alcohol.  John was laying on the couch with a handle of vodka empty on the coffee table. Still inebriated he tried his best to engage in conversation in a far friendlier manner than last night, I was unsure if he is genuinely more hopeful or if it was the vodka talking.

‚ÄúWhat can I do to assist you, detective?‚Äù John said in slurred speech.

‚ÄúJohn, we found a tooth at the base of the stairs last night. It was covered in blood. We thought it might have belonged to the suspect before we ended up age dating it. Turns out the tooth belonged to someone who lived near 400 years ago. John, did the tooth belong to you or your wife? Maybe a family heirloom?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if I know any Indian who would be weird enough to hold onto a tooth from a potential ancestor so no, and my wife never mentioned anything about a tooth.‚Äù John sarcastically remarked.

‚ÄúWhat about the feather sticking out of her chest‚Äù blurted Carson.

‚ÄúWhat? What feather?‚Äù John stated with a sudden seriousness that caught us off guard.

I darted a glance at Carson as I deliberately withheld that information out of fear that John would further blame himself. Especially since he is higher risk but since John‚Äôs currently being watched closely by Red I guess it's the best we got right now. The tooth came up blank but John‚Äôs curiosity and sobering seriousness led me to believe it was our best shot.

‚ÄúIt was an eagle feather, protruding from her chest. It was, besides the dismemberment, how we were able to connect the murder of Tallulah Birdinground from two weeks ago to this one.‚Äù Carson answered.

‚ÄúYou guys should leave. I don‚Äôt want you guys to get in over your head with this.‚Äù John stated.

‚ÄúThat's ridiculous John. Whether you like it or not this is our case, and it's your kid on the line. Let us help you. Besides, if your withholding something from us that won‚Äôt look fondly on you, who might I remind, if we can‚Äôt find anything else is primary suspect #1‚Äù I stated firmly.

‚Äú Fine ya bastard.‚Äù John snarked.

He continued, ‚ÄúListen, some people from my tribe told stories. Dumb stories, to scare children to make sure they listened to their elders. That if they misbehaved they would be taken and their mothers would be eaten up. I never believed it until someone on the reservation when I was a kid lost his wife and child sixteen years back. The feather was lodged in the wife's chest. If what you tell me is true and you refuse to give up, then me and Red can take you to the old chief of tribal police at our reservation. If he‚Äôs still around anyway. Last I heard he lives in the Bear Tooth pass. Maybe I got the facts wrong but he could tell you what happened.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat's a start.‚Äù I replied.

	Do I believe in supernatural occurrences? Well I do believe in God, so I guess that would mean yes. However, despite being a man of faith I have always tried to keep my job in objective reality, what I could see and what I could control. Was there some monster that took these women's lives and took their children? In my mind no. The only monsters that exist in my line of work are manmade. My mind began to drift to Keenan. However, this was our best shot at catching the culprit and if this story is true maybe the murder at the tribe sixteen years ago is the same man who killed John‚Äôs wife.

Once Red returned we filled him in on the details and agreed to meet with Chief of the tribal police, Paco in two days that Friday. We shook hands and John shared a look with me that I can only describe as mutual respect, a far better start then how we initially met. John is a good man, I can tell. It was a shot in the dark but it was all that we had. The rest of Carson and my day was filled with paperwork on the second phantom murder in the same month. 

The department was starting to put the pressure down on us to find someone to convict, even if that meant John. You have to understand that in a town the size of Billings, serial killers are the talk of the town. That coupled with department politics, and pressures from the press, there is not much room for failure. Wouldn‚Äôt want to make the department look bad. I just hope Paco held onto some evidence from back then. Otherwise I might have to try and convict a grieving father. Is that justice?

That night my wife ordered a pizza (pregnancy cravings). We cuddled and watched our show since I didn‚Äôt have any late night dismemberment calls. Nights like this made me think that it was time for me to transfer to less dangerous and less busy work. When it was just me and her, it was perfect. We called it quits around 9 PM and when I‚Äôm able to catch as many Zzz‚Äôs as I can, I do. Sleep isn‚Äôt guaranteed anymore.

I had another dream. This one longer. The same one, accept this time John was with me. We both fell into the snow. In the distance that same thing was there. This time sprint-crawling at us. I heard the singing again but this time it was different words from the first dream.



‚ÄúCrow child, beware the red-painted face,

She walks between worlds, she leaves not a trace.

If she calls you at night from the cottonwood tree,

Don‚Äôt follow her voice ‚Äî or you‚Äôll never be free.‚Äù



I started looking around to see the voices. When I turned around, I saw three Native children in a shrub about 20 yards away. They were the ones singing. The choir. When I turned to tell John, I saw whatever was crawling at us grab him by the ankle, its face covered by John's lower-body but it had to be over 8 feet tall. It dragged him back where it came from and it was John‚Äôs screams that finally woke me from my dream. When I woke up I was sweating. I checked my phone and saw I got a text from Carson. To my shock and horror. The text said bluntly:

‚ÄúJohn‚Äôs dead. Red called in to report it. Hung himself. He left a message for you. Get down here.‚Äù



**PART FOUR:**

When I got to the department to pick up Carson, Captain Beck of homicide, a total prick if there ever was one; reminded me that if John hung himself that means we‚Äôre down our only suspect.

‚ÄúIrons you better find someone or it's your career. Pressure from the press is becoming too much so figure it out! I refuse to be in the negatives again this year.‚Äù

	See that's the issue with the God damn work. Murder cases aren‚Äôt even about catching the person responsible, only what will help the statistics look more favorable for this jack off‚Äôs boss who is coming up for reelection. 

‚ÄúYes sir, understood.‚Äù I replied. 

Am I a coward? A grieving father killed himself and I don‚Äôt have the guts to stick up for him. Some father I will be. My kid will be raised by a coward. Why did John do it? I promised him I would find his boy. Finally, there was a connection between three murders with one common variable. It wasn't over yet. Guess he left something for me? A message? I think about the dream I had last night. What was that?

Carson loaded up in the car and we went back to Red‚Äôs house. Red looked like he didn‚Äôt sleep or eat anything. He was a mess. He put on a strong face for us though.

‚ÄúHere, it‚Äôs for you. I couldn‚Äôt make any sense of it.‚Äù Red spoke softly while handing me a letter.

Here is what the letter said:

‚ÄúCrow child, beware the red-painted face,

She walks between worlds, she leaves not a trace.

If she calls you at night from the cottonwood tree,

Don‚Äôt follow her voice ‚Äî or you‚Äôll never be free.

Crow child, run when her red eyes gleam,

She walks without sound, she slips through your dream.

If she calls from the dark of the cottonwood tree,

Your voice will be lost, and your bones will be free.

Irons, I saw you there in the snow. Tread carefully or she‚Äôll drag your corpse next.‚Äù



	I was left dumbfounded from the letter. I was familiar with the words in the first part of the letter, the children's voices still echoing in my ear. The second verse I didn‚Äôt hear or recognize. He saw me in the snow? We shared a nightmare? Not likely since when I woke up from his screams in the dream he was already dead. Maybe he learned this toon from the stories back on the tribe.

‚ÄúRed, are you sure you don‚Äôt recognize any of these words? John mentioned stories from the tribe that talked about children getting snatched up?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúJohn was 12 years older than me, I was just 5 years old when the murder Paco investigated took place. I am not familiar with these words. There's more on the back.‚Äù Red said solemnly while pointing at the letter.

He was right, the back of the letter attached an address in the Bear Tooths. This was where Paco lived now. Underneath the address it just said:



		‚ÄúI know you're a good man, Irons. Find my boy.‚Äù

‚ÄúRed are you still up for this? Nobody would fault you for not coming with us‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúTake me up there, Paco might start shooting if he sees two white men sneaking onto his land.‚Äù Red stated with some semblance of a smile.

‚ÄúAlright it‚Äôs decided. We‚Äôll go see Paco tomorrow morning.‚Äù



That night, I had the longest dream yet. Started the same as before. John wasn‚Äôt there this time. I fell, blood spread through the snow, except I finally saw where the blood came from. I saw an infant, looking fresh out of the womb, umbilical cord choking it, shivering in the cold. It sat in my lap oozing blood around where I was in the snow. I looked up and saw the beast. This time it wasn‚Äôt crawling. It just stood there, I couldn‚Äôt make out any specifics on the creature, just its silhouette. Then the singing started again.



‚ÄúOh, Red Woman, legend and flame,

Wrapped in sorrow, carved into our name.

Through mountains she wanders, through fire and snow,

A spirit of balance from long, long ago.



Oh, Red Woman, curse and flame,

A shadow etched deep in Crow tribe‚Äôs name.

She roams through the blizzards, the mountains and more, with blood on her breath,

Bringing silence and sorrow and beautiful death



Hush now, child... don‚Äôt follow the cry.

When the stars go out, and the wind runs dry...

She waits in the cold, where the last light bled.

They call her the Red Woman...

And her path is blood-red.‚Äù



When I turned behind me there were the three native children and the infant being held by one of the children, a young boy. When I looked back at my lap the baby was gone. When I turned back to the creature, it was striding on its hind legs with such viscous speed through the snow causing what I can only describe as what it looks like to be behind a snowplow on the highway. I stood up and started running. For the first time I had full mobility in this dream. Sprinting through the snow I ran, and in the distance I saw a cabin. With the creature on my tail, I kept running and as I got closer to the shelter I saw Carson standing in the doorway on a cross. Pieces of his skin were missing and he was shrieking



‚ÄúRELEASE ME! THERE IS NO GOD OTHER THAN YOU! I SWEAR IT TO BE TRUE. WITCH RELEASE ME AND I WILL SERVE YOU.‚Äù Carson screamed and sang.



‚ÄúGOD IS DEAD‚Äù He repeated over and over.



	Then the children singing came back, so loud I collapsed to the ground. Carson joined the choir.

‚ÄúThey say she was mortal, a girl left to die,

Abandoned in snow with a scream to the sky.

Her heart turned to cinders, her soul split in two‚Äî

Now she walks with the wolves... and they howl when she‚Äôs through.‚Äù



I collapsed to the ground, the noise was too much. Then silence. I heard heavy breathing like an exhausted horse behind my left ear. Warm, dry heaving. Paralyzed by fear I couldn‚Äôt turn to face it. Then long bloody fingers with sharpened nails at least three inches long touched my shoulder in a rhythmic tapping that was the same melody sung by the choir. Tap, tap, tap. The fingers bouncing off my shoulder, the breathing getting softer and softer. Then I woke up.

I contemplated the news. Another woman dead, a Natalie Bodoway, dismembered in the streets of this godforsaken town. No prints, no witnesses, no noise. Her child is missing. I am beginning to not feel anything when I go to the scenes. I take a long drag from my cigarette that I bummed off my partner Carson. He gave me shit since I have been proclaiming ever since I found out my wife was pregnant that ‚ÄúI swear I‚Äôm gonna quit‚Äù; then proceed to smoke at any inconvenience. He was right though, before my kid is even here, I have already let them down. Some father I‚Äôll be.

‚ÄúSo much for quitting ya dick!‚Äù Carson laughed.

‚ÄúOh fuck off, we are gonna be there awhile.‚Äù I replied with an emotionless faint smile.

‚ÄúYeah well, suppose you're right. If it‚Äôs anything like the last one, not much to look forward to.‚Äù Carson stated plainly, but I could see it on his face. It‚Äôs starting to weigh on him.

I should begin by explaining what my job is or was. I worked murders. Homicide for the police department in Billings Montana. Despite our smaller population compared to other cities, we have just as high of a murder rate per capita, up there with the likes of Chicago, Detroit, New York. It also happens to be the most depressed city in America, go ahead, look it up. It's because of the winters. The cold and what lies within the blizzard that can bring anybody down to their lowest point. We have a large Native American population in not only Billings, but all of Montana. Where I live in Billings, we have a large population of the Natives from the Crow tribe. The people in this tribe god bless them, walk around like they're already dead. They add to the suicide rate. Them along with the several drunk drivers. In Montana, if you aren‚Äôt a skier or really good at anything in particular, you drink during the winter. That makes me the most talentless motherfucker around. Comes with the job. Long nights, horrors that nobody should be exposed to, feeling alone. Anyway, enough about my shit, my point is people come to Montana to escape whatever demons that held onto them. Unfortunately for the unknowing, this place is where demons are born. As the years go by, the less good I see and what's in place instead, I‚Äôm afraid of.



Due to the road closures (A frequent occurrence in the winter), it took us even longer to get to the scene of the crime atop the Rim Rocks. The Rims are a plateau of sandstone rock that overlooks the city. Formed millions of years ago, it used to be the shoreline of an ocean. Remember the drunk drivers? Its a suicidal drunks wet dream. People throw themselves off multiple times per year. They also have a few caves that are hard to reach. Usually when troopers get called to the caves it is to break up huddles of homeless people, or if they are lucky and get to have some fun, the occasional cult. When we did arrive at the home, the environment sank everything in its path. The gravity held everyone down by the neck and would not subsist. An officer that went by Riggs met us when we got out of the car. Riggs informed us that the husband, a man named John Bodaway who had been staying at his brother's house called to request a wellness check on his wife because he hadn't heard from her for a week. They were separated for the last month, their six year old son was staying with his wife. Riggs went on to say that the Husband had an alibi everyday for the past two weeks and that he didn't suspect he had anything to do with it. The officer also said that the husband is on his way to the house to confirm the body belongs to his wife. We thanked Riggs but told him to keep the husband out of the house until we got everything we needed. We started towards the house. The door to the home was ripped off laying at the base of the porch. I shot a glance of shock to Carson. We ordered everyone to vacate the home so we could inspect the crime scene thoroughly. The house was clean, no smudges on the windows, dishes put away, not one speck of dust to be seen. The house only had two floors, the base floor where we were as we walked in, and the basement. We hesitantly made our way down the stairs. In the washer/dryer room there she was. A headless, limbless sack of flesh lay before us whose red ooze stained the carpet surrounding it. She had a black crow tattoo on her rib, a common tribe tattoo. Likely the only thing the husband will be able to use to identify the woman. The sack of flesh laid there with an eagle feather stabbed into her chest. The tears of flesh and marks around her neck, arms and legs looked like someone took a saw and slowly ripped into her piece by piece. Stunned, Carson and I both sat there for two minutes without a word, then finally:

 ‚ÄúJust like the last one‚Äù I whispered under my breath.

‚ÄúYep, looks like we got a serial killer and kidnapper on our hands. Two dead, two kids missing, same type of feather too.‚Äù Carson muttered.

‚ÄúWhat in gods na‚Äì‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, God's dead.‚Äù Carson said sharply, cutting me off. I saw he was trying to hold it together as a single, somber tear ran down his cheek.



**PART TWO**:

As we were wrapping up our notes in the basement, we heard shouting above.

‚ÄúHusband, must be.‚Äù Carson stated.

‚ÄúWant me to handle it?‚Äù I asked.

What people won‚Äôt tell ya in the movies is that this is always the hardest part of the job. No matter how desensitized the job becomes, telling innocent civilians they will never see their loved ones again will never become easier. In this case, even worse. The husband won‚Äôt even get to do an open casket at the funeral, and on top of that his son‚Äôs missing. Carson and I agreed to not tell him about the feather. Racism in this state has led to a lot of racially motivated murders and since his wife was a white woman we wouldn‚Äôt want him to blame himself for this crime.

‚ÄúYeah, fuck, could you get this one?‚Äù 

‚ÄúYeah I got you man‚Äù I replied.

As we made our way back upstairs, something caught my eye. A sharp tooth, covered in blood at the base of the stairs. I picked it up, observed it with Carson then put it in a zip lock bag to get analyzed by forensics. Once I placed it in the ziplock I noticed I nicked myself on the thumb and was bleeding. Maybe they have a pet I thought? Regardless it probably wasn‚Äôt going to come up with much. As soon as we turned the corner atop the staircase in the empty door frame was a man, presumably John Bodaway covered in dirt and grime being held back by Riggs and two other officers trying to keep him from entering.



‚ÄúAh shit, this one is gonna be rough.‚Äù I stated plainly. Carson just stared blankly to the ground not looking up to meet me or anybody else in the eye. I made my way over.

The man's bright red face looked as though the grief and anger were going to spill molten lava out of every orifice visible to the naked eye. In his blind rage and pain he began  shouting more once he saw us. 

‚ÄúWhere the fuck is my wife?! I refuse to believe that she's dead, where were you huh where the fuck were you?!‚Äù  The husband hollered.

I gestured to Riggs and his men to let him free and I approached the man. I stood face to face with a grieving husband. No matter what he says or does I can‚Äôt fault him because I‚Äôd want to kill anyone if anything like this happened to me and my family. 

‚ÄúJohn Bodaway? I work homicide. I am Detective Ralph Irons. I can‚Äôt imagine what your going through right now but‚Äì‚Äù. John punched me squarely in the jaw causing some blood to drop on the spotless flooring. 

‚ÄúFuck you pig! Spouting your rehearsed lines, fuck that. Tell me something useful or get the fuck out after I look at the corpse you claim is my wife. And where is my boy?‚Äù He began to cry.

Riggs and his men began to rush towards John and I waved them off. Not wanting to punish this defeated man more than he has already been punished by God and on top of it, they were rehearsed lines. What is this job turning me into? I grabbed him from the top of his shirt below his neck and swore to him. 

‚ÄúJohn, we are going to help you. I am sorry. And I swear to you, I will find your boy. From one father to another I won‚Äôt rest till we bring whoever did this to justice.‚Äù 

	John looked at me, the pain in his eyes were palpable, he nodded at me. Once I let go of him I asked him if his wife had a black crow tattoo on her ribs. As soon as the words left my mouth his anger washed off his face in an instant and only anguish remained. He confirmed that it was his wife. I said right now we didn‚Äôt have any solid leads or much evidence but since this has happened once before, hopefully the department will give us more time and resources will be used towards finding the killer and his son.

‚ÄúCan I see her? Can I please see my wife's face? I want to apologize to my wife for all my mistakes.‚Äù John pleaded. 

I told John he shouldn‚Äôt go down there. I had to tell a father his son was missing and his wife was dismembered in his own home, regardless if they were separated I can only imagine what he‚Äôs going through. After I explained why he couldn't, John collapsed to the ground and started wailing on the hardwood floor till his knuckles were bloodied. Carson was in the corner of the kitchen with his head down. 

When tensions lowered, Police escorted John back to his brother's house, afraid of him driving himself. I made sure to get John‚Äôs contact information before he left and I promised him I will give him a call If Carson and I get any leads. When everyone had left Carson walked up to me.

‚ÄúThanks for taking that punch for me.‚Äù With a light smirk.

‚ÄúYeah no problem, want to go get a drink? I could use something for the pain, that big Indian sure can throw a haymaker‚Äù I laughed as much as someone could laugh at a moment like this. How else could anyone make it through a job like this without trying to laugh instead of actually thinking about all the horror? I lied to Carson, the punch didn‚Äôt hurt that bad. I just wanted to blur the image of John‚Äôs wife, or whatever was left of her out of my mind.

‚ÄúYeah sure, I could use one too.‚Äù Carson replied.

The car ride after the bar was silent. The type of silence that's deafening. No amount of alcohol was gonna permanently erase what we both saw that night. Where did that fucking kid go? Despite driving well beyond the legal limit I made it back to the station where we dropped off the tooth to be processed by Kim at forensics. When I parked the car outside of Carson's car, Carson looked at me and paused before stating,



‚Äú You know you shouldn‚Äôt have lied to him. You promised him you‚Äôd find the boy. We have no leads, and the kid from two weeks ago has no trace either. Remember the only reason we even suspected Tallulah Birdinground of having a kid was the walker next to her corpse at the park. We have jack shit.‚Äù

‚Äú I know, but if I was in John‚Äôs shoes right now, I‚Äôd prefer to be lied to.‚Äù

‚ÄúSee ya tomorrow‚Äù, Carson left.

	Cognitive dissonance can be defined as mental discomfort from two or more conflicting attitudes, beliefs, and feelings. That is what it is like coming home to my wife Khalyn after work. To pretend everything is okay when I haven‚Äôt felt okay for a long time. Being married to a cop isn‚Äôt a walk in the park but she made it seem that way. She loved me despite the late nights, despite the nightmares, despite the alcohol on my breath. I didn‚Äôt deserve her. I came home at 1 in the morning and she had her bed side lamp on and waited for me to come home. Her growing excitement for the baby, and I was emotionally unavailable. I have had so much fear of bringing a child into this world. Ever since Keenan.

‚Äú How was work, my love?‚Äù She asked innocently.

	She was the only person in this whole world I could melt to from just her words. I began to weep. I told her I couldn‚Äôt talk to her about it until I was ready but she understood. She understood me completely. I kissed her goodnight and flipped to my side, tears down my cheek, the stench of black coffee, a cigarette, and five Moscow mules still on my tongue. I passed out. 

I had a dream last night. I have a unique ability to remember my dreams and I make it a habit to write down what I dreamt of as soon as I wake up. It plays like a movie in my head. I was falling, falling off a cliff into snow. When I hit the ground I didn‚Äôt wake up like I normally would in dreams where I fall. I couldn‚Äôt move, what appeared as red blood spread through the snow surrounding me. I felt warm. In the distance I saw someone or something, on all floors slowly crawling toward me. Simultaneously I heard singing, a chant-like rhythm that vibrated my ears. Children's voices sang the toon. Before I could see what was approaching me I woke up. To my knowledge this is what the children sang.



‚ÄúOh, Red Woman, child of the flame,

Cloaked in silence, never speak her name.

In the wind she is dancing, in dreams she is near,

A warning, a whisper, a shadow of fear.‚Äù



The phone rang at 7 AM. It was forensics. They got the lab results back from the tooth.

‚ÄúRalph, The blood on the tooth did belong to Natalie Bodaway. However, we are a bit confused.‚Äù Kim stated.

‚ÄúWhat about?‚Äù I replied

‚ÄúThe tooth you gave us, we tried to age the tooth to get an idea of roughly how old the suspect would be. We weren‚Äôt able to connect it to any DNA in any of our records. So we tried radiocarbon dating. From our estimates, the tooth you gave us came from someone who likely would have died 400 years ago.‚Äù

1o1vdlp,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1o1vdlp/i_dated_coworker_twice_and_it_destroyed_my_mental/,I dated coworker twice and it destroyed my mental health,"So I meet this girl early 2024, thought she was pretty and not much else about it.

Months went by and in december 2024 we had sex in my car after few weeks of talking at work. I remember her jumping at my c**k with no condom. Thought that's a bit wierd, like I don't know you? Also I was afraid of STD's and said we can wait, but we had sex anyway. She also just broke up with a guy, and I did too with my ex. 

At first I was like let's just hook up from time to time and that would be it.

Weeks went by and after talking every day we decided to step into relationship.

I saw red flags earlier when she blamed he ex for everything and talking shit all the time about him. (they broke up and went back together 3 times inside 5 years).

Relationship was going all right for 4 months. I felt loved and we were talking about children names and stuff like that, but the more I spent time with her I realised how hollow she was. She had no goals in life, often joked that she would marry someone rich. She was 21 and I was 26. Her days would mostly contain of working 7hr shift then having a nap, and later having a 3 hour coffees with her girl friends. And no matter how much I liked her looks I just had that on the back of my mind. At that time I was working two jobs, one in company with her and freelenced at home. Always had ambition for money.

I also had an ex of 4 years that was software engineer and she kinda always pushed me and motivated to do something out of my career. 

Anyway, that's why I broke up. She had no goals in life. 

A week went by I stared to miss her and tought I made mistake, but at the same time I saw her being online on Whatsapp 24/7 after a breakup. I remembered she used to talk with her ex there and still had his number. After I challenger her she confessed, they went to see eachother and had a kiss. She said she wanted to see if there is some feelings left. She also said she did not feel anything and was thinking about me.

I said I missed her but that kissing her ex FIVE DAYS after our break up is not normal and we can't be in relationship at the moment.

Anyway, weeks went by and we were seing eachother at work. Had sex few times and I was getting strong feelings for her again.

It was june 2025 when I said to her that we can be together again, but she needs to block that ex. She didn't wan't to, later saying she needs him for w**d bcos his is the best in the city.

Month later, she confessed of seeing him from time to time to get that w**d. Her story also changed few times. Once saying she just had a drink with him few times, other times saying she never had a drink etc.

Also around the same time, I kissed her at work after she was being flerty. Later that day, she's lying down at my sofa NAKED and message comes from her ex saying 'when are we going to see eachoter?'. But that's not all: only day later, she's openly saying shes having a date with another dude. I got so mad texing her all type of shit bcos I found out she was on a date for total of 9 hours.

Bitch said nothing really happened and that they were just talking for 9 hours lmao.

Knowing that she saw 3 guys in matter of few days got a clear picture for me. Finally I realised she's a hoe and not worth my time. It was difficult, but brain saw what heart couldn't. We had a huge verbal fight over text and in the office saying all the worst type of things to each other.

Month later, we somehow reconnected again. She said she dropped those two guys and that we can success together if we forget all the bad things etc.

We started realionship again. 10 days in we already broken half of the rules we set. I mentioned her ex oftenly, she said that no one else called her whore in her life and stuff like that.

After only 30 days we were on the edge of break up, but I saved it. Reason was we wen't on a roadtrip and had a huge fight when coming back home. She was constantly criticising my diving style and at one moment I stopped and just let her drive. Didn't talk for an hour and half in a car.

15 days more wen't by I just saw how she gave up on me. She was acting disrespectful and just looking at me differently. Making all the excuses out of little things that never ever were problem to her. So one night I was just like 'Okay, let's break up, bcos I know you want to.' and she actually did it. 

Days went by and I just couldn't look at her at work, I was mad and everything was pissing me off about her. Ocasionaly I was texting her saying please don't do that etc etc. She was obviosly pissed and we were going and each other on text messages AGAIN.

We somehow made a deal to have a talk in my car to settle things once for forever. She said how she still loves me, but that only love was not enough. We both cried. At the end we made a deal to ingnore eachother at work. No hello, no what would you like to eat, no nothing.

Just 24 hours later she was teasing me and showing me a bracelet I bought her and offering it to me to take it back. I was like 'we had I deal, why are you doing that?'

Anyway, just today I found out my susspicions were true. She already started talking to a new guy. 5 days after our break up and 8 days before we went in a car to clear things up and when she said that she still loves me (I also asked if there is someone new, she said no). I found out bcos that guy is a friend of our other coworker. That coworked didn't know about us tho.

I challenged her again, saying how dare you, she said she was over me even before break up, which I knew, but what hurt me is that she said she still loved me and chooses to talk to the other guy.

We echanged few words, shouting, I called her a whore, got pissed and kicked the table at work breaking two monitors when they fell on the floor. Almost everyone in the company knew about my crashout bcos it was loud and she was crying. Telling I was aggresive. 

She blocked me on everything, I even made a fake account to message her once again and say how bad she is.

So don't get me wrong, I did many bad things to her and called her names, but she was my only one for a year and it was nothing but her, while she was tying with different guys and kept coming back to me.

I let her hurt me twice the same way and I also knew that she never looked me at the way I did to her. I saw it today. 

Many people gave me warnnings about her, but I tought I can fix her.

I also live in small conservative city where dating 4 guys in 10 months is huge and not usual.

I wasted a whole year over someone that was only good for sex and, but somehow I got attached bcos she had pretty nose or sum.

I know that this shit would end up earlier if we didn't work together.

Right now, I am a bit of shock.

I just couldn't believe how can I forgive so much shit to someone and how could I let someone do that to me, just bcos she's got a pretty face or voice. Like I know how empty she is, but everytime I saw her face I feel in love.

I tought I would do better at 27 years old.

I'll keep you guys updated if you found this interesting

1o1vdch,https://i.redd.it/ziu0mdjt60uf1.png,"She Was The Joke, Now She's The Queen","Chapter 1 A Fragile Marriage

Brinley Shaw set her resignation letter on the HR manager's desk, her fingertips smoothing the edge of the paper as though ensuring not a single fold or wrinkle remained. 



The manager parted his lips, a resigned sigh escaping before he spoke. ""It's such a pity to see you leaving, Brinley. Are you absolutely certain about this?""



""Yeah,"" Brinley said with a soft smile, her eyes curving like crescents. ""I'd like to spend more time with my family.""



Stepping out of the company building, she was met by a flood of sunlight. 



She squinted against the glare and pulled a pair of sunglasses from her bag, slipping them on. 



Just then, her phone buzzed. It was a message from Ryland Francis, a real estate agent. 



""Mrs. Palmer, the owner of the villa you like has agreed to lower the price. Could you come view it this afternoon?""



Brinley smiled at the good news. 



That small villa on the outskirts of the city--a place she had admired for a long time--stood far away from the noise and bustle of downtown. 



Its peaceful surroundings might just be the opportunity she needed to strengthen her fragile marriage with Colin Palmer. 



Married for two years, she and Colin had never once been in\*\*mate.



In the beginning, she had convinced herself his hectic work schedule was to blame, but gradually, doubts about her own attractiveness began to creep in. 



Finally admitting that something had to change, she quit her job to spend more time with her husband and salvage their relationship. 



That afternoon, she visited the villa. It turned out to be even more charming in reality than in the photographs. 



The elderly couple who owned it had kept a garden brimming with roses, their sweet perfume lingering heavily in the air. 



Standing in the middle of the sunlit living room, Brinley watched her shadow stretch long across the polished floor. 



""This is the one! How do we proceed?"" she said in a firm voice.



Ryland's face lit up. ""Excellent! I'll prepare the contract immediately. By the way, will Mr. Palmer be joining you to sign?""



Brinley shook her head. ""No, he's tied up with work. I'll take care of it.""



""Alright then. Please bring all necessary documents with you tomorrow for the paperwork.""



On her way home, Brinley sent Colin a quick message. ""I resigned and found a villa I love. I'm planning to buy it.""



His reply came almost instantly. ""So sudden? But if it makes you happy, that's what matters. I'll come home early tonight; we'll celebrate.""



Warmth spread through Brinley's ch\*\*t as she gazed at the screen. 



Colin had always treated her with care and tenderness. He remembered her favorite meals, always had sweet treats ready when she had her period, and never missed an anniversary without a thoughtful gift. 



Apart from his refusal to be in\*\*mate with her--which upset her deeply--he was nearly the perfect husband. 



The following morning, Brinley dressed with special care before leaving for the real estate agency. 



She chose a pink-and-white dress, the very one Colin often praised as suiting her best. 



""Mrs. Palmer, please, have a seat,"" Ryland greeted her warmly. ""I'll bring out the contract.""



Smiling, Brinley passed him a folder. ""Here's a copy of my marriage certificate with Colin. I would like to register the house as a joint marital property.""



Ryland accepted it and tapped away at the computer for a while, but soon he frowned. ""That's odd... The system isn't pulling up your marriage registration record.""



Brinley's smile faltered. ""What do you mean by that?""



""Probably just a system error,"" Ryland said quickly, trying to reassure her. ""You can confirm it directly at city hall. It happens every now and then.""



Brinley's ch\*\*t pounded wildly. A creeping sense of unease overwhelmed her. 



Forcing herself to stay calm, she replied, ""Alright. I'll head there right away.""





Chapter 2 A Substitute

The staff at the City Hall adjusted his spectacles, peering at the copy of the marriage certificate again and again. 



At last, he spoke. ""Ma'am, the document you've presented is counterfeit. Our records show no marriage registration whatsoever between you and Mr. Colin Palmer.""



Brinley stiffened when she heard this. 



She opened her mouth to speak, but no words came; her lips only twitched. 



""This... this can't be,"" she finally muttered, her voice almost inaudible. ""We were married here... two years ago...""



The staff shook his head, looking sympathetic. ""I'm sorry, but this is the truth: I can't find any information about your marriage in our system. If you believe you've been deceived, it's best to report the matter to the authorities.""



Nodding stiffly, Brinley accepted the copy of the marriage certificate as he handed it back to her. 



Her fingers trembled when they brushed its edge. 



The document she had treasured for the past two years turned out to be fake. How preposterous! 



Outside the City Hall, Brinley halted on the steps, her head dizzyingly light. 



She needed time. She needed somewhere quiet to untangle the storm of thoughts threatening to consume her. 



She wandered into a small caf√© nearby and ordered an iced black coffee, strong and bitter. 



The sharp taste filled her mouth, but it could not compare to the bitterness clawing at her heart. 



At that very moment, her phone lit up with a message from Colin. ""Brinley, what would you like for dinner tonight? I'll pick something up after work.""



A surge of nausea rose within her as Brinley stared at the message on her screen. 



Drawing in a shaky breath, she typed, ""Don't worry. I'll cook.""



Almost instantly, Collin replied, ""Alright. I'll be home on time after work.""



Brinley didn't respond. 



Instead, she checked the clock; it was half past three. 



Then she decided to pay a visit to Colin's office without informing him beforehand. 



His tech firm was located in a modern tower on the east side of the city. 



She had delivered him lunch there many times, enough that the receptionist recognized her at once and greeted her with a smile, waving her through. 



The elevator carried her to the 28th floor, and she stepped out, following the familiar path toward Colin's office. 



But as she rounded a corner, the sound of his familiar voice drifted from the break room. ""I'm conflicted, but you know... I just can't let go of Milly.""



Brinley stopped in her tracks, her body stiffening as though the world itself had frozen around her. 



Quietly, she backed up and pressed herself against a column, straining to listen. 



""What do you intend to do, then?"" a man asked. 



Brinley recognized the voice immediately. It belonged to Vance Graham, Colin's close friend. 



""Are you planning to stay with Brinley while marrying Milly Russell? Colin, that's not fair.""



The words struck Brinley like a violent blow. She had to grasp the wall for balance. 



Milly Russell? Who was she? Colin was marrying that woman? 



Each word felt like a bl\*\*e slicing into her ch\*\*t. 



""I know it isn't fair,"" Colin admitted with a weary sigh.



""But when Milly left to pursue her career abroad, I was heartbroken. Then Brinley came along... she reminded me so much of Milly that dating her finally brought healing to my broken heart.""



Brinley bit her lower lip until she tasted the metallic tang of bl\*\*d. She reminded him of Milly? 



So that was what she was? A substitute? 





Chapter 3 Marriage Alliance

""But later on,"" Colin continued in a hesitant voice, ""I came to realize Brinley isn't like Milly at all. She's softer, depends on me more, and... loves me in a way Milly never did.""



Vance chuckled derisively. ""And with that realization, you still justify deceiving her?""



""I don't deceive her!"" Colin's voice rose with sudden intensity before falling again into a whisper. ""I truly do care for her... it's just...""



""Just what?"" Vance asked impatiently. 



""It's just that I can't seem to cut Milly off completely,"" Colin admitted, sounding torn. 



""She was my first love. When she came back from abroad and reached out, I couldn't push her away. But at the same time, I didn't want to give up Brinley.""



""So you went as far as to forge a marriage certificate, letting Brinley believe the two of you were legally bound?"" The disgust was obvious in Vance's voice. ""Colin, that makes you nothing short of a sc\*\*bag.""



Colin fell silent for a few seconds before answering with a bitter, self-mocking laugh, ""Yes, I'm a sc\*\*bag. I want Milly's fire, Brinley's gentleness... I even let myself imagine how perfect it would be to keep them both in my life.""



""You must be delusional!"" Vance snapped. ""If Brinley ever found out about your double life, do you honestly think she'd forgive you?""



""She won't ever know,"" Colin said, interrupting Vance.



""She trusts me completely, never questions a thing. Even when she phoned while Milly and I were in b\*d, she was too oblivious to notice anything unusual.""



Those words smashed Brinley's heart like a ruthless strike. 



Turning, she walked soundlessly toward the elevator. Each step felt unreal, as though she were moving through a heavy fog. 



The man she had loved for two whole years was nothing but a liar. 



... 



Brinley had no idea how she managed to return home. 



Absentmindedly, she unlocked the door, drifted into the kitchen, and began preparing dinner mechanically. 



At half-past six, the sound of a key turning in the lock reached her ears. 



Colin entered with his usual charm, carrying a fresh bouquet of lilies. 



""I'm back."" He leaned in and brushed her forehead with a k\*\*s, smiling warmly. 



Brinley forced her lips into a smile as she accepted the flowers.



Oblivious to her stiffness, Colin shrugged off his suit jacket and sniffed the air. ""Mmm, what did you make? Smells delicious.""



""Your favorite. Grilled meat."" Brinley turned away to place the bouquet into a vase, hiding her cold expression. 



Through the entire meal, Brinley kept her eyes fixed on him, studying every gesture. 



Collin's phone never left the table, lying face down, and every so often he flicked his eyes at it, as though waiting for a message. 



""My head aches a little,"" Brinley muttered after dinner. ""Could you fetch me some medicine from upstairs? It's in the nightstand drawer.""



""Of course,"" Colin said immediately, springing up. ""You just rest here.""



The moment he was upstairs, Brinley snatched his phone. 



The screen came on, requiring a password. 



She tried her own birthday, then their anniversary. Neither unlocked it. 



Just as she was about to attempt again, a message notification flashed across the screen. ""Colin, wonderful news--I'm pr\*\*nant!""



Brinley's fingers froze. The words blazed before her eyes, stabbing her like sharpened steel. 



She stared in shock until Colin's footsteps began descending. Panicking, she dropped the phone back onto the table. 



Colin returned with the pills and a glass of water. ""You don't look well. Do you want to lie down early?""



Brinley accepted the pills, pretended to swallow, then replied, ""I'm fine. By the way... is there something going on at the office? You kept glancing at your phone.""



For a moment, Collin stiffened, but then he quickly composed himself. ""Yes, a project issue. I might need to head back later.""



""Then go,"" Brinley said with a gentle smile, though her heart was breaking inside. ""Work always comes first.""



Colin slipped on his coat, pausing to k\*\*s her cheek. ""Don't wait up for me. Get some rest.""



As the door clicked shut behind him, Brinley's smile crumbled. 



Tears formed in her eyes, but she stubbornly tipped her head back, refusing to let them fall. 



Only after a long struggle did she finally pick up her phone, her hand trembling, and dial a number she hadn't called in two years. 



""Dad, I've decided. I'll return home... and I'll accept the marriage alliance you arranged.""





Chapter 4 Charity Gala

Three months later



A sleek black Maybach rolled to a stop outside the glittering club, its polished surface catching every shard of neon light. 



When Brinley stepped gracefully from the car, her eyes lingered on the grand entrance, ablaze with chandeliers and flashing lights. 



Tonight, the Knight family's annual charity gala was underway, drawing in the wealthiest and most influential figures in Bleron. 



Old memories pressed in, bitter and sharp, tugging a sarcastic curve at Brinley's lips. 



""Ms. Shaw, you've finally arrived."" Ryan Bailey, the Knight family's longtime butler, hurried forward with quick precision, flanked on both sides by two lines of imposing bodyguards. 



Every gesture radiated deference. 



Brinley tilted her chin and gave him a faint, cold nod in acknowledgment. 



Ryan gestured politely. ""This way, please,"" he said, moving ahead while those bodyguards followed, their presence alone drawing stares. 



Because of Brinley's identity, they bypassed the main hall and slipped through a private passage. 



At her quiet request, Ryan waved off the bodyguards, but their absence did little to lessen the attention she attracted. Her arrival still turned heads. 



Draped in a bold crimson gown with her hair swept into a sleek ponytail, Brinley radiated confidence--elegant and arresting in her simplicity. 



Recognition rippled through the crowd. 



""Isn't that Brinley?"" someone whispered, awe and curiosity threading through their tone. 



""Oh my, what is she doing here? Since when did the Knight family's gatherings become open to just anyone?""



""I heard Colin tossed her aside after catching her cheating. It was a whole spectacle. How does she still have the audacity to show up tonight?""



""Shh, keep your voice down. She used to be the apple of the Shaw family's eye, but they've cut her off completely... Look at her, still carrying herself as if she matters.""



The sharp whispers rippled through the hall and drifted to Brinley, yet she remained unfazed. 



Settling elegantly into a quiet corner, she sampled the appetizers with calm detachment. Her serene poise only made the gossipers more irritated. 



At the front of their little pack was Renee Dale, daughter of Dale Group's CEO. 



With a sly smile curving her lips and a glass of w\*\*e poised in her hand, she swept toward Brinley, her companions trailing behind. 



Renee's voice carried deliberately, her smile sharp as glass.



""Well, if it isn't Miss Shaw. All by yourself tonight? Where's Mr. Palmer? Oh, that's right--I heard the two of you split. Hardly shocking. A man like him could not tolerate a partner who was unfaithful.""



Before Brinley could answer, one of Renee's companions leaned in eagerly. 



""Renee's right. No offense, Brinley, but do you really think showing up here will win Mr. Palmer back? That ship has sailed. Milly's the one by his side now--she's carrying his child.""



The sharp exchange only stirred the crowd further, hungry for drama. 



Brinley tilted her head just enough to meet Renee and her entourage with a cold glance. 



""You all seem awfully fascinated with my personal life,"" she said, her tone deceptively gentle but edged with steel. ""My affairs, however, aren't open for your judgment. And as for why I'm here..."" Her lips curved into a wry smile.



""Does the Knight family need your permission before extending an invitation?""



Renee faltered, her face reddening with fury. ""Brinley, get off your high horse! Everyone knows about your scandal. How dare you show your face here? What, are you desperate? No man would ever want you now!""



Brinley's eyes hardened, her voice cool and measured. ""It's none of your business, Miss Dale."" She tilted her chin ever so slightly, her tone laced with irony.



""Instead of wasting your time on me, perhaps you should pay attention to Dale Group's stock. Word is, it's been plummeting thanks to some very poor decisions.""



The color drained from Renee's cheeks. ""What are you talking about? That's complete nonsense!""



Brinley arched a brow, and replied evenly, ""Don't play d\*\*b. You know exactly what I mean.""



She brushed Renee off with effortless grace, lifting a delicate pastry from the tray and taking a slow, unhurried bite as if savoring the sweetness more than the conversation. 



Across the hall, Colin was in conversation with a man, one arm draped possessively around Milly's waist. 



He turned instinctively at the sound of the commotion, his gaze locking on a figure he could never mistake. A jolt ran through him, his ch\*\*t tightening at the sight of Brinley. 



Without sparing Milly a glance, he strode straight toward Brinley despite the surprised onlookers. 



""Colin?"" Milly's voice faltered, her smile freezing. 



Her expression soured as her eyes landed on Brinley not far away, and she hastily hurried after Colin. 





Chapter 5 Painted Brinley As A Desperate Clinger

""Brinley!"" Colin's voice broke through the commotion as he shoved past the curious onlookers, urgency sharpening his stride until he was standing right before her. 



For a moment, his ch\*\*t clenched with dread--afraid she might vanish again, slipping through his fingers the way she had before, leaving him to chase shadows in her absence. 



But when their eyes met, her gaze was icy, stripped of any trace of warmth. 



His breath hitched, the words he'd prepared dissolving on his tongue. The joy that had flared in his ch\*\*t extinguished in an instant, like a bucket of cold water poured over his head. 



His expression hardened, and his tone became chilling.



""What are you doing here? And why did you disappear back then without a single word? Do you know how much time and money I burned trying to find you?"" His voice cracked with anger.



""Tell me you didn't actually throw me away for someone else, like all those whispers claim.""



The sharp demand pulled every head toward Brinley, curious eyes cutting into her like bl\*\*es. 



Milly hurried to Colin's side, clutching his arm with soft urgency. ""Colin, please, calm down and talk it through. Miss Shaw must have had her reasons for vanishing without a word.""



She faced Brinley then, her sympathetic tone laced with gentle reproach. 



""Miss Shaw, I understand if you still carry feelings for Colin, but you should move on. Disappearing and then suddenly showing up again like this--surely you know it only makes things harder for everyone.""



Her words, disguised as soothing counsel, instead painted Brinley as a desperate clinger, a caricature of obsession. 



The judgment weighed heavy in the air, and the whispers around them grew sharper, more merciless. 



""Exactly--what is Brinley after, hanging around here like this when Colin has already moved on?""



""Milly is being awfully generous--if it were me, I would've snapped by now.""



""This is the Knight family's event. They don't just let anyone wander in. Did she slip past security? Where's the organizer? Someone needs to toss her out.""

The silence in the apartment was a living thing. It wasn't the peaceful quiet they usually shared, the kind filled with the soft rustle of turning pages or the comfortable hum of the refrigerator. This was a thick, heavy silence, broken only by the frantic thumping of Leo‚Äôs own heart. He stood in the doorway of their bedroom, a suitcase open on the bed, and watched Sarah fold a sweater with a methodical precision that felt like a weapon.

It had been two years. Two years since she‚Äôd walked into his life at that forgettable art gallery, a splash of vibrant color in a sea of beige. Two years of lazy Sundays, shared coffee, and building a life he‚Äôd only ever dreamed of. He‚Äôd sold his cramped studio apartment. She‚Äôd moved out of her ""efficiency loft."" They‚Äôd found this place together, a sun-drenched corner unit with space for both his writing nook and her easel.

He had asked, of course. In the beginning. ""Any ex-husbands I should know about? A trail of broken hearts?"" He‚Äôd meant it as a joke, a way to acknowledge their pasts without dwelling on them.

She‚Äôd laughed, a sound like wind chimes, and kissed him. ""My past is a boring story, Leo. You‚Äôre the exciting part.""

He‚Äôd believed her. Why wouldn't he? She was Sarah: fiercely independent, wholly present, and seemingly unburdened.

The unraveling started with a piece of official-looking mail, mistakenly delivered to their old address and forwarded by a former neighbor. It was addressed to a ""Mrs. Sarah Chen-Anderson."" Leo, thinking it was a simple error, had left it on the counter for her.

He saw the color drain from her face when she saw it. That was the first crack.

""Leo,"" she began, her voice unnaturally calm. ""We need to talk.""

And so, the story spilled out. Not the boring one she‚Äôd promised, but a tangled, messy one. His name was Mark. They‚Äôd married young. It had been over in everything but paperwork for years before she met Leo. A ""clean break"" had gotten messy with a shared business asset, a final signature that was never obtained. They were technically, legally, still married.

The air left Leo‚Äôs lungs. ""Technically? Legally?"" The words felt foreign. ""For two years, Sarah? You‚Äôve been my‚Ä¶ my everything, and you were someone else‚Äôs wife?""

""It wasn't like that!"" she cried, her composure shattering. ""He wasn't in my life! He wasn't in my heart! It was a piece of paper, a stupid, lingering piece of paper I was too ashamed and scared to finally cut!""

""Scared of what?"" Leo‚Äôs voice was dangerously low.

""Of this!"" she gestured wildly between them. ""Of you looking at me the way you are right now! Like I‚Äôm a stranger. Like our entire life is a lie.""

Now, watching her pack, that feeling hadn't left him. It was a lie. A lie of omission, but a lie nonetheless. The foundation of their home was built on a secret.

""Where will you go?"" he finally asked, the words scraping his throat.

She didn‚Äôt look up from the suitcase. ""A hotel. Then‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll figure it out. I‚Äôve already filed the papers. It‚Äôll be final in a few months.""

Months. The word hung in the air. He thought of the future they‚Äôd planned‚Äîthe trip to Italy booked for next spring, the dog they were going to adopt, the way she‚Äôd started leaving a corner of the closet empty, ""just in case."" All of it was now tainted, shadowed by the ghost of a man he never knew existed.

She zipped the suitcase closed. The sound was final, like a judge‚Äôs gavel. She turned to face him, her eyes red-rimmed but dry. She looked older. He felt older.

""I never meant to hurt you, Leo. You have to believe that. You are the only real thing that has ever happened to me.""

He believed her. That was the cruelest part. He could see the truth of her love for him, even now, shining through the wreckage of her deception. It didn't erase the hurt, but it complicated it, twisting it into something even more painful.

She picked up her suitcase and walked towards the door. He didn't move to stop her. He just stood there, a statue in the home they‚Äôd built, listening to the sound of her footsteps recede down the hall, followed by the soft, definitive click of the front door closing.

He was alone. The silence was no longer just heavy; it was complete. He looked around the room, at the painting she‚Äôd done of the view from their balcony, at the mug she drank her tea from every morning. He had known a version of Sarah that was perfect for him. But he hadn't known her. Not the part that was capable of carrying such a monumental secret. And as he stood there in the devastating quiet, he realized the question wasn't just did he know she was married before. The question that would haunt him for a long, long time was: did he ever really know her at all?",1,1759979422.0,u_simon2020carzelais,6,1.0,False

1o1vaj7,https://www.reddit.com/r/InternetFriends/comments/1o1vaj7/short_story/,Short story,"*The door üö™ that was never closed....* 

The silence in the apartment was a living thing. It wasn't the peaceful quiet they usually shared, the kind filled with the soft rustle of turning pages or the comfortable hum of the refrigerator. This was a thick, heavy silence, broken only by the frantic thumping of Leo‚Äôs own heart. He stood in the doorway of their bedroom, a suitcase open on the bed, and watched Sarah fold a sweater with a methodical precision that felt like a weapon.

It had been two years. Two years since she‚Äôd walked into his life at that forgettable art gallery, a splash of vibrant color in a sea of beige. Two years of lazy Sundays, shared coffee, and building a life he‚Äôd only ever dreamed of. He‚Äôd sold his cramped studio apartment. She‚Äôd moved out of her ""efficiency loft."" They‚Äôd found this place together, a sun-drenched corner unit with space for both his writing nook and her easel.

He had asked, of course. In the beginning. ""Any ex-husbands I should know about? A trail of broken hearts?"" He‚Äôd meant it as a joke, a way to acknowledge their pasts without dwelling on them.

She‚Äôd laughed, a sound like wind chimes, and kissed him. ""My past is a boring story, Leo. You‚Äôre the exciting part.""

He‚Äôd believed her. Why wouldn't he? She was Sarah: fiercely independent, wholly present, and seemingly unburdened.

The unraveling started with a piece of official-looking mail, mistakenly delivered to their old address and forwarded by a former neighbor. It was addressed to a ""Mrs. Sarah Chen-Anderson."" Leo, thinking it was a simple error, had left it on the counter for her.

He saw the color drain from her face when she saw it. That was the first crack.

""Leo,"" she began, her voice unnaturally calm. ""We need to talk.""

And so, the story spilled out. Not the boring one she‚Äôd promised, but a tangled, messy one. His name was Mark. They‚Äôd married young. It had been over in everything but paperwork for years before she met Leo. A ""clean break"" had gotten messy with a shared business asset, a final signature that was never obtained. They were technically, legally, still married.

The air left Leo‚Äôs lungs. ""Technically? Legally?"" The words felt foreign. ""For two years, Sarah? You‚Äôve been my‚Ä¶ my everything, and you were someone else‚Äôs wife?""

""It wasn't like that!"" she cried, her composure shattering. ""He wasn't in my life! He wasn't in my heart! It was a piece of paper, a stupid, lingering piece of paper I was too ashamed and scared to finally cut!""

""Scared of what?"" Leo‚Äôs voice was dangerously low.

""Of this!"" she gestured wildly between them. ""Of you looking at me the way you are right now! Like I‚Äôm a stranger. Like our entire life is a lie.""

Now, watching her pack, that feeling hadn't left him. It was a lie. A lie of omission, but a lie nonetheless. The foundation of their home was built on a secret.

""Where will you go?"" he finally asked, the words scraping his throat.

She didn‚Äôt look up from the suitcase. ""A hotel. Then‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll figure it out. I‚Äôve already filed the papers. It‚Äôll be final in a few months.""

Months. The word hung in the air. He thought of the future they‚Äôd planned‚Äîthe trip to Italy booked for next spring, the dog they were going to adopt, the way she‚Äôd started leaving a corner of the closet empty, ""just in case."" All of it was now tainted, shadowed by the ghost of a man he never knew existed.

She zipped the suitcase closed. The sound was final, like a judge‚Äôs gavel. She turned to face him, her eyes red-rimmed but dry. She looked older. He felt older.

""I never meant to hurt you, Leo. You have to believe that. You are the only real thing that has ever happened to me.""

He believed her. That was the cruelest part. He could see the truth of her love for him, even now, shining through the wreckage of her deception. It didn't erase the hurt, but it complicated it, twisting it into something even more painful.

She picked up her suitcase and walked towards the door. He didn't move to stop her. He just stood there, a statue in the home they‚Äôd built, listening to the sound of her footsteps recede down the hall, followed by the soft, definitive click of the front door closing.

He was alone. The silence was no longer just heavy; it was complete. He looked around the room, at the painting she‚Äôd done of the view from their balcony, at the mug she drank her tea from every morning. He had known a version of Sarah that was perfect for him. But he hadn't known her. Not the part that was capable of carrying such a monumental secret. And as he stood there in the devastating quiet, he realized the question wasn't just did he know she was married before. The question that would haunt him for a long, long time was: did he ever really know her at all?",1,1759979343.0,InternetFriends,0,1.0,False

1o1v87d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1o1v87d/student_flipped_a_desk_during_my_sub_job_i/,Student flipped a desk during my sub job ‚Äî I evacuated the class and got scolded for it,"Yesterday was one of those days that made me question everything about how public schools are being run.

I‚Äôm a substitute teacher, and I got a last-minute call from a school I‚Äôve only worked at once before. Their sub for a 3rd-grade class canceled last minute, and the office begged me to come in. I hadn‚Äôt had coffee, was in sweatpants, still had yesterday‚Äôs makeup on, but they sounded desperate, so I said yes.

When I got there, the para covering the room had 30 kids literally playing Four Square inside the classroom. Chaos. She quickly warned me that one of the students (I‚Äôll call her K) had some behavior challenges and wasn‚Äôt allowed to participate in math centers that day.

About 20 minutes into the math lesson, things went from noisy to scary. K started growling loudly, then began shoving her desk ‚Äî hard ‚Äî and eventually flipped it completely over, nearly hitting two nearby students. I stayed calm, told the class we were evacuating, clapped to get their attention, and led everyone quietly outside.

No one answered my radio. I had to flag down another teacher to call for admin. The principal finally came down, and I explained what happened. She seemed annoyed that I hadn‚Äôt somehow stayed with the student and gotten everyone else out. She checked on the student but never came back to tell me what was happening, so I just kept the rest of the class outside until we were told it was safe to return.

Later, during what should‚Äôve been my break, I got pulled into the psychologist‚Äôs office for a ‚Äúchat‚Äù with the principal and a couple of other staff members. The whole thing felt like I was on trial. They said the student ‚Äúgets overstimulated,‚Äù is on the spectrum, and was embarrassed. I said, ‚ÄúSo are you saying it was wrong to evacuate when she was flipping furniture and putting others at risk?‚Äù The principal said, ‚ÄúNo, it was the right call‚Ä¶ but we don‚Äôt want her to feel bad.‚Äù

They even brought the student in to talk about her feelings while I sat there, still shaking from the whole thing. No one thanked me for keeping 30 kids safe. Then, less than half an hour later, the principal was out on the playground handing out buttons with her own face on them that said ‚ÄúWOW!‚Äù like nothing happened.

The craziest part is that there were two parent volunteers and a sign language interpreter in the room who saw everything. All of them told me afterward that I handled it perfectly. But somehow, I still left feeling like I had done something wrong.

I keep thinking: if a student is capable of flipping desks or acting out aggressively, why don‚Äôt they have proper support or a para? Why are we pretending everything‚Äôs fine in a room full of other kids who deserve to feel safe?

I love teaching, but this day broke me a little. I am not sure I ever want to take a job at that school again. I know I‚Äôm good at what I do but at what cost is it worth my time? ",17,1759979144.0,Teachers,10,1.0,False

I was very pregnant with her sister so decided to wait a few months after the baby was born. Baby is almost 4 months and my toddler is 24 months now.

On Friday we took off her diapers during wake times and the first two days were amazing. We had some accidents but also a lot of wins. On day 4 she started going #2on the floor but I moved her to the potty and she finished. I was so excited!

Day5 (yesterday), I had an appointment and had to leave her with my sister for a bit (who also has toddlers) and said she didn‚Äôt think she‚Äôd be able to handle the potty training, so I put her in a pull-up during that time (she peed twice on the potty at my sisters).

Another win is we‚Äôve had 2 short outings (going to the bank and then another time a coffee shop) where she kept her pants dry and peed in potty at those places.

I always wear smart watch, but usually never ""track"" my sleep, its been an ongoing thing for me to skip GYM ""because you need 9 hours of sleep for that"" or drink a lot of coffee ""because I havent slept enough"". 

Thinking back, I remember bragging to someone that I can ""Will myself"" into sleeping 5 hours almost exactly, but that I considered a feat for rare occasions and never considered any kind of problem that lack of sleep may entail. 

When I was ""LLMing"" about health, I randomly stumbled upon a phrase ""wake up instantly"" and kept going from it, since LLM associated this with health risks. From there it went into rant about sleep. And for first time in my life, I truly thought about how people are expected to sleep and that I sleep very differently for decades.

Hopefully, its an NSS syndrome, with pattern consistent across decades and all the other signs (for ex. lack of: circadian rhythm effect, ""weekend sleep"", irritable mood, dark memories of school).

This made me reconsider empathy for other people, not just emotional and neurological, but physical differences we may all have.",9,1759978528.0,sleep,4,0.91,False
1o1v05a,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1o1v05a/the_red_woman_final/,The Red Woman: Final,"**PART FIVE**:

I awoke to the sound of a concerned wife tapping my shoulder. She said I started to scream and she got worried. I thanked her. I gave her a long embrace and kissed her. She knew I would be gone for at least a day. You see the road through the Beartooth mountains gets shut down during winter. You need special access in order to get through and even then, the trip has to be made with extreme caution. Luckily from the looks of the address John provided on the note, it isn‚Äôt all the way by Cody Wyoming. We can go through Red Lodge and get there in two and a half hours. I told her the combination to the gun safe and told her to be safe. I am not sure why I felt the need but maybe it was the nature of my dream. I won‚Äôt have any service up in those mountains. As soon as I shut the door I wanted to go back in, but I stopped myself. I just wanted this mess to be over. I wanted to go to sleep at night without these dreams. Would I make it down that mountain? Once I find John's kid, I am done with Billings, and I am done with this job. I said a quick prayer in my car, then left to pick up Carson and Red.

The trip was a quiet one. Red for obvious reasons but even Carson looked shaken up. I think we all wanted peace. The only way to do that was to talk to Paco and build some evidence. Despite the horror of my nightmares I will not chalk up these murders to something supernatural. All the horrors I have ever seen came from man, and man alone. It‚Äôs not our job to take life. I catch the bad men, they go to jail for life. That's when God passes his judgment. I am just a man, who catches worse men. It couldn‚Äôt be anything else.

We finally made it to the Cabin. Red led us to the door and knocked. He said something in Crow tongue but I couldn‚Äôt possibly say what. Then an older gentleman from inside the home responded. He opened the door slowly and peaked. Red said,

‚ÄúAre you Paco, sir?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes I am, what is this?‚Äù

‚ÄúSir, my name is detective Ralph Irons. This is my partner Carson. We were hoping to get some answers and information on a murder that took place sixteen years ago. You se‚Äì.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou need to leave now for your own good!‚Äù Paco shouted.

	Then, like clockwork, as if he triggered it with his warning, the most heavy blizzard of the winter hit the Bear Tooths. Begrudgingly Paco told us to get inside. He told us at minimum it would be two days before we could leave based on how heavy this blizzard looked to be. I guess I didn‚Äôt notice it from the outside but entering the warm cabin, all the windows were boarded up. A fire was going and Paco said he would start making dinner for us. Paco was a short man, maybe 5‚Äô7, with a stocky build and a mustache, he was missing an ear.  He looked to be in his late 60‚Äôs and ever since we got to the cabin, he's had a cig in his mouth. It reminded me of how bad I wanted a smoke. I asked Paco if it‚Äôs okay for us to smoke while we waited for dinner and he said bluntly, in a passive tone:

‚ÄúDo what ya like‚Äù

So then I demanded Carson pass me a smoke. Luckily it did crack a smile out of him. I punched him asking if he was okay and that I was worried about him.

‚ÄúYeah I‚Äôm good man, just had a weird dream is all, didn‚Äôt get good sleep.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat was your dream about?‚Äù I asked concerningly.

‚ÄúYou died.‚Äù Carson said quietly.

	Before I could respond, Red walked up and also demanded Carson bummed a cig. Carson groaned and passed him one. Soon the four of us in that cabin hot boxed the place with cig smoke. It was the best buzz of my life. After some small talk and cheap laughs, Paco brought out some whiskey. Paco spoiled us. He cooked up some elk steak with twice baked potatoes. Between the dinner, the whiskey, and the smoke, I for the first time wasn‚Äôt thinking about my job. The four of us started talking about war stories. Worst things we‚Äôve seen. Paco started. I asked Paco about the murder sixteen years ago and he said he would need a lot more whiskey before he retells it. He called this one, a warm up. 

Paco dealt with backlash from friends and even family about becoming tribal police. In some reservations, if you try to leave you are seen as betraying your family. In some reservations, if you work for the government you‚Äôre a ‚Äúsell out‚Äù. There is a significant level of self hatred amongst the reservations. His home was vandalized often. He said it  was his second year as a cop. He recounted the time he and his mentor Trent Fala were investigating human trafficking within the tribe. 

‚ÄúI was new to the job. Despite some of the backlash, I could bear it. We got some calls about more women going missing around the reservation. We subsequently conducted multiple stake outs surveilling different homes. Around that same time, I thought I was in love with a woman named Cheyenne, and went on a couple dates. Massive bosom, shared a bed on multiple occasions.‚Äù Paco said, which got a few chuckles and ‚Äúooos‚Äù from the three of us listening closely.

‚ÄúOne night she asked me about my job, what was happening. I told her, the women in the tribe were being hunted and I was gonna put an end to it. I told her where me and Trent were investigating that night. Trent and I went on another stake out for a home we knew moved drugs and suspected, moved women. Around 3 AM Trent woke me up and pointed towards the house. Two white vans pulled in, then before I could process it, the sliding doors opened and bullets sprayed in the air at me and Trent. Trent was riddled right away and I was hit in the upper pectoralis and they blew off this ear. I stumbled out of the car and started firing back and called for backup. I was able to hold out, miraculously. Trent wasn‚Äôt so lucky. When the adrenaline started to wear out, my mind slowed and I processed what just happened. Cheyenne sold us out. She was part of it. Nobody else knew what we were doing besides Trent, myself, and her. Never tried my hand at love again. My friend was dead. The ring was put to rest. The woman I thought belonged to me, locked up.‚Äù Paco ended his tale.

	The room fell silent. He told us not to pity him with a laugh of great gusto and said ‚ÄúNext, Next!‚Äù Carson and I sat and looked at each other.

‚ÄúWell you go ahead, you‚Äôve been in homicide longer than me. Anything I got is what you got too‚Äù Carson said to me.

‚ÄúFine fine, I‚Äôll go next.‚Äù I proclaimed before swigging more whiskey down my gullet. Keenan‚Äôs face popped in my head.

‚ÄúIt was my first year in homicide. I‚Äì‚Äù

	Before I could continue, slow, methodical, hard banging slammed at the cabin door. We all looked around. 

‚ÄúIgnore it, the storm plays tricks. Nobody could navigate themselves out here. Any human would have immediately locked themselves away once they saw the snow.‚Äù Paco assured.

‚ÄúHelp me. I‚Äôm scared. "" A child pleaded from behind the door. A young boy.

	At that instant Red jumped from his chair and with an intensity, headed to the door. Paco yelled at him to stop. All Red said in the return was.

‚ÄúIt's my nephew.‚Äù

	Paco pleaded with Red, that it wasn‚Äôt who was at the door but it was pointless. Red opened the door, the wind from the snow slammed the door inside the cabin and kept it there. There was no child. Nothing was visible besides two thin, wrinkled poles that were longer than the door itself. Large grey blood stained feet were all Red saw then he looked down at what he hoped would be his nephew. Then it happened. The moment I finally knew, some monsters weren't madmade. The root of my nightmares lately. Before we could process, She or it bent down, her saggy tietze dropped down just above her knees and there it was. Her face. An elongated blood stained snout, thinned black hair, and red eyes. Eyes that were darting all around stalking Her prey. It all happened so fast. Red‚Äôs head was enveloped with the same rows of teeth as the tooth at the crime scene. She brought her head back outside and stood straight up. All that was visible of Red was his feet dangling in the air. He was screaming, then She chomped down. Red‚Äôs decapitated corpse fell to the ground and was the first of us to stain the snow blood red.





























**PART SIX**:

Paco screeched to shut the door as went for his pistol. He shot three rounds towards Her. only one connected her shin as Carson slammed the door shut. I was frozen. 

‚ÄúWhat the fuck was that? Reds fucking dead!‚Äù Carson yelled.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know? I thought since you came up here to ask me about sixteen years ago you knew what She is?‚Äù Paco replied.

‚ÄúWe thought it was just some sick murder‚Äù I replied, trying to remain calm. The three of us had our pistols out. Waiting.

‚ÄúNo, She torments the crow tribe. The Red Woman. It‚Äôs why I quit my job to move out here. Once I got involved, she never gave me peace. All I have been doing ever since is try to do research on Her.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs there anything we can do? I saw you shot it, can She be killed?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúTo my knowledge, She cannot die. She was given power from dark forces. Story goes she belonged to a rival tribe, Crow fighters ambushed during winter. Killed everyone, including her child. She was revived and has punished us ever since. There are rumors though, if we know her name She will leave us.‚Äù

Just as he said that something hit the roof of the cabin. She was crawling atop us.

‚ÄúDo you have any idea what Her name could be?‚Äù I asked.

Paco grabbed a book and started flipping through the pages before stating:

‚ÄúLisaxp√∫a‚Äì‚Äù

A shot rang. Carson shot Paco. Carson looked terrified. 

‚ÄúWhat the fuck did you do?!‚Äù I yelled.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt move on my own, I didn‚Äôt mean to. Help me!‚Äù Carson replied in horror.

	I started towards Paco then ‚ÄúCRACK‚Äù, everything went dark.

	I woke up walking up to a house that looked all too familiar. My first homicide case. ‚ÄúNo, don't take me back here, I don‚Äôt want to see it again please‚Äù I thought. I had no control over my movement. I couldn‚Äôt close my eyes. In 2017 I was 28 years old. I was with the man I was replacing, Josh Peck. Josh was retiring that summer and was training me on the job. We got called because neighbors on Burlington Street reported screaming and a gun shot. We were informed that the house belonged to an Everette Blanc, his wife Julie Blanc, and their 8 year old autistic son, Keenan. I never forgot their names. I never forget any of the names. I was back there, walking up with Josh. Pistols drawn, we walked in and there it was. Everette shot Julie in the head, and was wailing on his son Keenan with a box cutter. Over and over and over and over. ‚ÄúSTOP, STOP, STOP IT! WHY ARE YOU SHOWING ME THIS AGAIN PLEASE GOD STOP THIS‚Äù I pleaded in my mind. So much noise within my psyche but just silence. Over and over and over and over he kept smashing down on Keenan. 

‚ÄúThe boy wouldn‚Äôt stop screaming, he wouldn‚Äôt stop screaming. Screaming and screaming and screaming! That cunt right there wouldn‚Äôt let me get rid of him once we found out his condition. She brought this on herself.‚Äù Everett said while still calmly bringing the box cutter down on Keenan‚Äôs sunken face.

	Josh noticed Everett had the handgun on the coffee table next to him and Josh dived for it. It happened so fast, Josh grabbed the gun, and shot Everett in the temple. In horror I looked at Josh. Josh wiped the gun and placed it in Everett‚Äôs hand. He looked at me and said:

‚ÄúWe tried to stop him, talk him down. He killed himself to escape justice.‚Äù



	I was new to the job. It was the only job that the suspect was there committing the crime while I was present. I was shaking. Josh grabbed me and punched me.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôre you gonna say boy?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe tried to talk him down, he pulled the trigger when we got here.‚Äù

 I really am a coward. My child will know his father as a coward. I never wanted kids after that. I was always so afraid. Afraid that I‚Äôd fuck the kid up or hurt them. Khalyn changed that in me. She‚Äôs so good. I‚Äôm just afraid I‚Äôm no good, no good for her, for this job, or for my kid. 

I never thought I was going to have to relive that. Then Josh turned blank, letting me go. This wasn‚Äôt what happened next. Then without a moment's hesitation my body started walking to the back door. When I opened the door I took a step and fell. I hit the snow hard. I was back to this never ending nightmare. The infant wasn‚Äôt there this time. This time it was Keenan. His sunken face in my lap. This poor boy. The culmination of my fear was causing the blood to flow in the snow. I looked up and there the Red woman stood still. The choir resumed its cursed melody. More voices than the last time. The three children with the infant, Carson, Kim, John, Red, Riggs, Captain Beck, Khalyn, Paco, Everett, Julie all joined the choir. Covered in blood they sang. They all danced to the melody of this witch and spread the blood throughout the white powder. 



‚ÄúListen, child of the plains and sky‚Äî

When the night turns red, don‚Äôt open your eye.

She walks the edge of the living and dead...

They call her The Red Woman ‚Äî

And her path is blood-red.



Oh, Red Woman, fire-born shade,

Haunter of silence, the forest afraid.

She dances through nightmares, she sings in your ear,

A shriek in the stillness, a hunger for fear.



They say she was mortal, a girl left to die,

Abandoned in snow with a scream to the sky.

Her heart turned to cinders, her soul split in two‚Äî

Now she walks with the wolves... and they howl when she‚Äôs through.



Crow child, run when her red eyes gleam,

She walks without sound, she slips through your dream.

If she calls from the dark of the cottonwood tree,

Your voice will be lost, and your bones will be free.



She whispers your name when the firelight's low,

Her fingers are smoke, her footsteps are snow.

Some say she flays you, some say she feeds‚Äî

But none who have seen her return from the reeds.



Oh, Red Woman, curse and flame,

A shadow etched deep in the Crow tribe‚Äôs name.

She roams through the blizzards, with blood on her breath,

Bringing silence and sorrow and beautiful death.



Hush now, child... don‚Äôt follow the cry.

When the stars go out, and the wind runs dry...

She waits in the cold, where the last light bled.

They call her the Red Woman...

And her path is blood-red.‚Äù

‚ÄúNO NO NO, STOP IT PLEASE. ENOUGH SINGING! IM SORRY. PLEASE IM SORRY.‚Äù I screamed.

	They did not stop. They just kept repeating. My wife walked out to me. Still singing. I turned around and the Red Woman was just walking slowly this time. I turned back to my wife and she arrived where I sat. Still singing. 

‚ÄúHoney what‚Äôs going on?‚Äù I pleaded, hoping for an answer.

She stopped singing momentarily and said softly:

‚ÄúOur path doesn‚Äôt have to be blood red‚Äù 

She turned back and walked away past the choir and into the blizzard out of sight. The choir still singing, still dancing. 

‚ÄúWhat? What does that mean, babe? Don‚Äôt leave me please!‚Äù I begged.

She did not look back. I was left there with Keenan‚Äôs corpse. I looked up and there she was. My first real look at her but things were different. She wasn‚Äôt as tall as I once saw her. She was just a young girl, probably 20ish. Normal. The red blood stained snout, the long skinny limbs, the eyes, gone. Covered in blood. A long slice down her buffalo skinned clothing around the stomach. She appeared pregnant. She looked down at Keenan then back at me. She offered her hand out. She wanted Keenan.

‚ÄúWhat do you want with him? What do you do with the children? ANSWER ME!‚Äù I pleaded.

‚ÄúYou will never know.‚Äù She replied.

No malice, no hatred, just stated as a fact. She grabbed Keenan and turned around. She walked into the blizzard. The choir followed her, opposite of where Khalyn went. The woman's silhouette changed and it looked like she was holding the hand of Keenan. The choir slowly danced into the blizzard out of sight.



Then I woke up.























**PART SEVEN**:

I awoke on the cold hardwood floor of Paco‚Äôs cabin. Carson was sat on the ground shaking and crying. I looked up and Paco was shot in the chest. He was dead. He died with his gun in his hand. A brave man through and through. I walked over to his corpse, maneuvered his hand and shot his pistol five times towards the front door where Carson and I were in relation to his body when I passed out. Carson looked scared and confused. I walked to him, grabbed him by the shirt and punched Carson. 

	‚ÄúPaco killed those women, you hear me. He refused to tell us where the body of those kids went but he admitted to their murder. He knocked me out when we walked in, he tied you up, and he sawed Red‚Äôs head off. We got free and he pulled his gun on us.‚Äù

	‚ÄúWhat, no! I have to own this Ralph. I killed a good man. What about that thing we saw?‚Äù

	‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry Carson. Nobody will understand.‚Äù I said solemnly. I looked outside and the blizzard ended.

	‚ÄúShe let us live. It isn‚Äôt our business to understand why, or what this is all about. I have a child on the way, I am just gonna focus on being a good parent for them.‚Äù

It was another day while we were trapped up that mountain. We brought Paco and Red‚Äôs bodies back and told our fictitious tale. They believed it. I told Kim the tooth was just a keepsake of John‚Äôs family. With no other witnesses around, no suspects, the department found their scapegoat. I am sorry Paco. Truly. Khaylyn and I moved away from Billings. I quit the force. Carson took over. We live in some small town on the outskirts of nowhere. I am officially a father now. While I still get scared that I will fuck the kid up, I know that I will never be like Everett. That kid reminds me that although there are monsters in this world; Manmade or not, there is still good. So I am sorry Carson, I am gonna have to disagree with you. God isn‚Äôt dead. I see proof of his existence every single day.

After a banana, morning coffee, and a kiss to my wife I was out the door. She tried asking more about baby stuff but I just couldn‚Äôt talk about it, there was a job to be done and in all honesty, I have been avoiding the subject. How could the tooth belong to someone from that long ago? Was the tooth a namesake of John's family? I am unfamiliar with Native American customs when it comes to holding on to something like teeth. Maybe it was a way to honor their ancestors. Too many questions and not enough answers. When I arrived Carson was waiting outside the department for me. We walked in together. He was rubbing his eye.

‚ÄúHow are you able to drink as much as you do and not call out of work?‚Äù Carson asked.

‚Äú I think my dads side of the family was Scottish or Irish"" I replied with a wink. Which was bullshit because to my knowledge I am mostly Welsh and English. Who cares, same island.

‚ÄúThat would explain your idiocracy, you make your ancestors proud‚Äù Carson giggled with immediate regret as I could tell his head cracked from it.

	When we got to forensics Kim came up to me looking a bit shaken. I asked her to see what was going on but she was inconsolable. Kim was a 66 year old woman who chain smoked. Worked for BPD for 30 years, a true rock in the department. I never thought I would see the day where she was shaken up by a piece of evidence. All she said to us was ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gone.‚Äù

	When we tried to press her as to what she meant she finally clarified. According to Kim the tooth was in more or less good condition. Besides the blood on it, not a single mark or erosion was indicated when we brought it to her the night before. Kim went on to state as soon as she radiocarbon dated the tooth and got the results it dissolved in front of her eyes. She had never seen anything like it before.

	So now we were left with no evidence left. Only knowledge that the tooth existed to begin with and how old it was dated to. Kim stated she would stand under oath and swear to the tooth's existence once we caught the suspect. I thanked her for her work and told Kim to get some rest. Carson and I took our leave.

‚ÄúSo now what?‚Äù Carson asked.

‚ÄúLet's pay John a visit. Maybe he‚Äôs got some ideas.‚Äù I replied.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt even know if the tooth had anything to do with the murder or the kid's disappearance.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe, but remember the way the wounds looked on Natalie? Or Tallulah Birdinground from two weeks ago? We thought a hack saw was the weapon but couldn't it also look like biting? I mean you saw the tooth right? The thing was sharp to the touch and it certainly didn‚Äôt feel like it was 400 years old.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell I guess we got nothing else going for us‚Äù. Carson said in an annoyed tone.

Carson is relatively fresh to homicide. He started about two years ago and has been my partner since his first day. I am three years older than Carson so the partnership has truly been more of a friendship and outside of my wife and immediate family, I am unsure if I consider anyone closer to me than Carson. However, Carson is impatient, and the job has taken a toll on him like it would any sane person. Although Carson is only three years younger than me I started homicide when I was 28, I am 36 now. I have been in this game far longer and after a while, with enough compartmentalization, the job becomes nothing more than that, a job. It can‚Äôt be anything else or you go mad. Right now for Carson, it‚Äôs everything.



I called John and he gave us the address of his brother Red‚Äôs house. When we arrived we were greeted by a scrawny 20 something year old. It was John‚Äôs brother Red. Red told us he would be back in an hour and he was going to take the opportunity to run to the store while we were here. He has been unable to leave John out of his sight in fear John would kill himself. We said we would hang here until he returned and he thanked us.

‚ÄúWas there really nothing other than her torso? Natalie was practically my sister, I never thought something like this could happen to her, someone so good.‚Äù Red asked quietly.

‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm real sorry. We‚Äôll find the bastard that did this.‚Äù I answered

‚ÄúThanks, anyway I‚Äôll try to make it quick, we can talk more when I get back.‚Äù Red left in a hurry.

	When we entered the home the smell of booze stung the nostril. While Red was able to hold John back from killing himself, it was apparent he couldn‚Äôt keep him away from alcohol.  John was laying on the couch with a handle of vodka empty on the coffee table. Still inebriated he tried his best to engage in conversation in a far friendlier manner than last night, I was unsure if he is genuinely more hopeful or if it was the vodka talking.

‚ÄúWhat can I do to assist you, detective?‚Äù John said in slurred speech.

‚ÄúJohn, we found a tooth at the base of the stairs last night. It was covered in blood. We thought it might have belonged to the suspect before we ended up age dating it. Turns out the tooth belonged to someone who lived near 400 years ago. John, did the tooth belong to you or your wife? Maybe a family heirloom?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if I know any Indian who would be weird enough to hold onto a tooth from a potential ancestor so no, and my wife never mentioned anything about a tooth.‚Äù John sarcastically remarked.

‚ÄúWhat about the feather sticking out of her chest‚Äù blurted Carson.

‚ÄúWhat? What feather?‚Äù John stated with a sudden seriousness that caught us off guard.

I darted a glance at Carson as I deliberately withheld that information out of fear that John would further blame himself. Especially since he is higher risk but since John‚Äôs currently being watched closely by Red I guess it's the best we got right now. The tooth came up blank but John‚Äôs curiosity and sobering seriousness led me to believe it was our best shot.

‚ÄúIt was an eagle feather, protruding from her chest. It was, besides the dismemberment, how we were able to connect the murder of Tallulah Birdinground from two weeks ago to this one.‚Äù Carson answered.

‚ÄúYou guys should leave. I don‚Äôt want you guys to get in over your head with this.‚Äù John stated.

‚ÄúThat's ridiculous John. Whether you like it or not this is our case, and it's your kid on the line. Let us help you. Besides, if your withholding something from us that won‚Äôt look fondly on you, who might I remind, if we can‚Äôt find anything else is primary suspect #1‚Äù I stated firmly.

‚Äú Fine ya bastard.‚Äù John snarked.

He continued, ‚ÄúListen, some people from my tribe told stories. Dumb stories, to scare children to make sure they listened to their elders. That if they misbehaved they would be taken and their mothers would be eaten up. I never believed it until someone on the reservation when I was a kid lost his wife and child sixteen years back. The feather was lodged in the wife's chest. If what you tell me is true and you refuse to give up, then me and Red can take you to the old chief of tribal police at our reservation. If he‚Äôs still around anyway. Last I heard he lives in the Bear Tooth pass. Maybe I got the facts wrong but he could tell you what happened.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat's a start.‚Äù I replied.

	Do I believe in supernatural occurrences? Well I do believe in God, so I guess that would mean yes. However, despite being a man of faith I have always tried to keep my job in objective reality, what I could see and what I could control. Was there some monster that took these women's lives and took their children? In my mind no. The only monsters that exist in my line of work are manmade. My mind began to drift to Keenan. However, this was our best shot at catching the culprit and if this story is true maybe the murder at the tribe sixteen years ago is the same man who killed John‚Äôs wife.

Once Red returned we filled him in on the details and agreed to meet with Chief of the tribal police, Paco in two days that Friday. We shook hands and John shared a look with me that I can only describe as mutual respect, a far better start then how we initially met. John is a good man, I can tell. It was a shot in the dark but it was all that we had. The rest of Carson and my day was filled with paperwork on the second phantom murder in the same month. 

The department was starting to put the pressure down on us to find someone to convict, even if that meant John. You have to understand that in a town the size of Billings, serial killers are the talk of the town. That coupled with department politics, and pressures from the press, there is not much room for failure. Wouldn‚Äôt want to make the department look bad. I just hope Paco held onto some evidence from back then. Otherwise I might have to try and convict a grieving father. Is that justice?

That night my wife ordered a pizza (pregnancy cravings). We cuddled and watched our show since I didn‚Äôt have any late night dismemberment calls. Nights like this made me think that it was time for me to transfer to less dangerous and less busy work. When it was just me and her, it was perfect. We called it quits around 9 PM and when I‚Äôm able to catch as many Zzz‚Äôs as I can, I do. Sleep isn‚Äôt guaranteed anymore.

I had another dream. This one longer. The same one, accept this time John was with me. We both fell into the snow. In the distance that same thing was there. This time sprint-crawling at us. I heard the singing again but this time it was different words from the first dream.



‚ÄúCrow child, beware the red-painted face,

She walks between worlds, she leaves not a trace.

If she calls you at night from the cottonwood tree,

Don‚Äôt follow her voice ‚Äî or you‚Äôll never be free.‚Äù



I started looking around to see the voices. When I turned around, I saw three Native children in a shrub about 20 yards away. They were the ones singing. The choir. When I turned to tell John, I saw whatever was crawling at us grab him by the ankle, its face covered by John's lower-body but it had to be over 8 feet tall. It dragged him back where it came from and it was John‚Äôs screams that finally woke me from my dream. When I woke up I was sweating. I checked my phone and saw I got a text from Carson. To my shock and horror. The text said bluntly:

‚ÄúJohn‚Äôs dead. Red called in to report it. Hung himself. He left a message for you. Get down here.‚Äù













**PART FOUR**:

When I got to the department to pick up Carson, Captain Beck of homicide, a total prick if there ever was one; reminded me that if John hung himself that means we‚Äôre down our only suspect.

‚ÄúIrons you better find someone or it's your career. Pressure from the press is becoming too much so figure it out! I refuse to be in the negatives again this year.‚Äù

	See that's the issue with the God damn work. Murder cases aren‚Äôt even about catching the person responsible, only what will help the statistics look more favorable for this jack off‚Äôs boss who is coming up for reelection. 

‚ÄúYes sir, understood.‚Äù I replied. 

Am I a coward? A grieving father killed himself and I don‚Äôt have the guts to stick up for him. Some father I will be. My kid will be raised by a coward. Why did John do it? I promised him I would find his boy. Finally, there was a connection between three murders with one common variable. It wasn't over yet. Guess he left something for me? A message? I think about the dream I had last night. What was that?

Carson loaded up in the car and we went back to Red‚Äôs house. Red looked like he didn‚Äôt sleep or eat anything. He was a mess. He put on a strong face for us though.

‚ÄúHere, it‚Äôs for you. I couldn‚Äôt make any sense of it.‚Äù Red spoke softly while handing me a letter.

Here is what the letter said:

‚ÄúCrow child, beware the red-painted face,

She walks between worlds, she leaves not a trace.

If she calls you at night from the cottonwood tree,

Don‚Äôt follow her voice ‚Äî or you‚Äôll never be free.

Crow child, run when her red eyes gleam,

She walks without sound, she slips through your dream.

If she calls from the dark of the cottonwood tree,

Your voice will be lost, and your bones will be free.

Irons, I saw you there in the snow. Tread carefully or she‚Äôll drag your corpse next.‚Äù



	I was left dumbfounded from the letter. I was familiar with the words in the first part of the letter, the children's voices still echoing in my ear. The second verse I didn‚Äôt hear or recognize. He saw me in the snow? We shared a nightmare? Not likely since when I woke up from his screams in the dream he was already dead. Maybe he learned this toon from the stories back on the tribe.

‚ÄúRed, are you sure you don‚Äôt recognize any of these words? John mentioned stories from the tribe that talked about children getting snatched up?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúJohn was 12 years older than me, I was just 5 years old when the murder Paco investigated took place. I am not familiar with these words. There's more on the back.‚Äù Red said solemnly while pointing at the letter.

He was right, the back of the letter attached an address in the Bear Tooths. This was where Paco lived now. Underneath the address it just said:



		‚ÄúI know you're a good man, Irons. Find my boy.‚Äù

‚ÄúRed are you still up for this? Nobody would fault you for not coming with us‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúTake me up there, Paco might start shooting if he sees two white men sneaking onto his land.‚Äù Red stated with some semblance of a smile.

‚ÄúAlright it‚Äôs decided. We‚Äôll go see Paco tomorrow morning.‚Äù



That night, I had the longest dream yet. Started the same as before. John wasn‚Äôt there this time. I fell, blood spread through the snow, except I finally saw where the blood came from. I saw an infant, looking fresh out of the womb, umbilical cord choking it, shivering in the cold. It sat in my lap oozing blood around where I was in the snow. I looked up and saw the beast. This time it wasn‚Äôt crawling. It just stood there, I couldn‚Äôt make out any specifics on the creature, just its silhouette. Then the singing started again.



‚ÄúOh, Red Woman, legend and flame,

Wrapped in sorrow, carved into our name.

Through mountains she wanders, through fire and snow,

A spirit of balance from long, long ago.



Oh, Red Woman, curse and flame,

A shadow etched deep in Crow tribe‚Äôs name.

She roams through the blizzards, the mountains and more, with blood on her breath,

Bringing silence and sorrow and beautiful death



Hush now, child... don‚Äôt follow the cry.

When the stars go out, and the wind runs dry...

She waits in the cold, where the last light bled.

They call her the Red Woman...

And her path is blood-red.‚Äù



When I turned behind me there were the three native children and the infant being held by one of the children, a young boy. When I looked back at my lap the baby was gone. When I turned back to the creature, it was striding on its hind legs with such viscous speed through the snow causing what I can only describe as what it looks like to be behind a snowplow on the highway. I stood up and started running. For the first time I had full mobility in this dream. Sprinting through the snow I ran, and in the distance I saw a cabin. With the creature on my tail, I kept running and as I got closer to the shelter I saw Carson standing in the doorway on a cross. Pieces of his skin were missing and he was shrieking



‚ÄúRELEASE ME! THERE IS NO GOD OTHER THAN YOU! I SWEAR IT TO BE TRUE. WITCH RELEASE ME AND I WILL SERVE YOU.‚Äù Carson screamed and sang.



‚ÄúGOD IS DEAD‚Äù He repeated over and over.



	Then the children singing came back, so loud I collapsed to the ground. Carson joined the choir.

‚ÄúThey say she was mortal, a girl left to die,

Abandoned in snow with a scream to the sky.

Her heart turned to cinders, her soul split in two‚Äî

Now she walks with the wolves... and they howl when she‚Äôs through.‚Äù



I collapsed to the ground, the noise was too much. Then silence. I heard heavy breathing like an exhausted horse behind my left ear. Warm, dry heaving. Paralyzed by fear I couldn‚Äôt turn to face it. Then long bloody fingers with sharpened nails at least three inches long touched my shoulder in a rhythmic tapping that was the same melody sung by the choir. Tap, tap, tap. The fingers bouncing off my shoulder, the breathing getting softer and softer. Then I woke up.	",2,1759978355.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

I contemplated the news. Another woman dead, a Natalie Bodoway, dismembered in the streets of this godforsaken town. No prints, no witnesses, no noise. Her child is missing. I am beginning to not feel anything when I go to the scenes. I take a long drag from my cigarette that I bummed off my partner Carson. He gave me shit since I have been proclaiming ever since I found out my wife was pregnant that ‚ÄúI swear I‚Äôm gonna quit‚Äù; then proceed to smoke at any inconvenience. He was right though, before my kid is even here, I have already let them down. Some father I‚Äôll be.

‚ÄúSo much for quitting ya dick!‚Äù Carson laughed.

‚ÄúOh fuck off, we are gonna be there awhile.‚Äù I replied with an emotionless faint smile.

‚ÄúYeah well, suppose you're right. If it‚Äôs anything like the last one, not much to look forward to.‚Äù Carson stated plainly, but I could see it on his face. It‚Äôs starting to weigh on him.

I should begin by explaining what my job is or was. I worked murders. Homicide for the police department in Billings Montana. Despite our smaller population compared to other cities, we have just as high of a murder rate per capita, up there with the likes of Chicago, Detroit, New York. It also happens to be the most depressed city in America, go ahead, look it up. It's because of the winters. The cold and what lies within the blizzard that can bring anybody down to their lowest point. We have a large Native American population in not only Billings, but all of Montana. Where I live in Billings, we have a large population of the Natives from the Crow tribe. The people in this tribe god bless them, walk around like they're already dead. They add to the suicide rate. Them along with the several drunk drivers. In Montana, if you aren‚Äôt a skier or really good at anything in particular, you drink during the winter. That makes me the most talentless motherfucker around. Comes with the job. Long nights, horrors that nobody should be exposed to, feeling alone. Anyway, enough about my shit, my point is people come to Montana to escape whatever demons that held onto them. Unfortunately for the unknowing, this place is where demons are born. As the years go by, the less good I see and what's in place instead, I‚Äôm afraid of.



Due to the road closures (A frequent occurrence in the winter), it took us even longer to get to the scene of the crime atop the Rim Rocks. The Rims are a plateau of sandstone rock that overlooks the city. Formed millions of years ago, it used to be the shoreline of an ocean. Remember the drunk drivers? Its a suicidal drunks wet dream. People throw themselves off multiple times per year. They also have a few caves that are hard to reach. Usually when troopers get called to the caves it is to break up huddles of homeless people, or if they are lucky and get to have some fun, the occasional cult. When we did arrive at the home, the environment sank everything in its path. The gravity held everyone down by the neck and would not subsist. An officer that went by Riggs met us when we got out of the car. Riggs informed us that the husband, a man named John Bodaway who had been staying at his brother's house called to request a wellness check on his wife because he hadn't heard from her for a week. They were separated for the last month, their six year old son was staying with his wife. Riggs went on to say that the Husband had an alibi everyday for the past two weeks and that he didn't suspect he had anything to do with it. The officer also said that the husband is on his way to the house to confirm the body belongs to his wife. We thanked Riggs but told him to keep the husband out of the house until we got everything we needed. We started towards the house. The door to the home was ripped off laying at the base of the porch. I shot a glance of shock to Carson. We ordered everyone to vacate the home so we could inspect the crime scene thoroughly. The house was clean, no smudges on the windows, dishes put away, not one speck of dust to be seen. The house only had two floors, the base floor where we were as we walked in, and the basement. We hesitantly made our way down the stairs. In the washer/dryer room there she was. A headless, limbless sack of flesh lay before us whose red ooze stained the carpet surrounding it. She had a black crow tattoo on her rib, a common tribe tattoo. Likely the only thing the husband will be able to use to identify the woman. The sack of flesh laid there with an eagle feather stabbed into her chest. The tears of flesh and marks around her neck, arms and legs looked like someone took a saw and slowly ripped into her piece by piece. Stunned, Carson and I both sat there for two minutes without a word, then finally:

¬†‚ÄúJust like the last one‚Äù I whispered under my breath.

‚ÄúYep, looks like we got a serial killer and kidnapper on our hands. Two dead, two kids missing, same type of feather too.‚Äù Carson muttered.

‚ÄúWhat in gods na‚Äì‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, God's dead.‚Äù Carson said sharply, cutting me off. I saw he was trying to hold it together as a single, somber tear ran down his cheek.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  


***PART TWO****:*

As we were wrapping up our notes in the basement, we heard shouting above.

‚ÄúHusband, must be.‚Äù Carson stated.

‚ÄúWant me to handle it?‚Äù I asked.

What people won‚Äôt tell ya in the movies is that this is always the hardest part of the job. No matter how desensitized the job becomes, telling innocent civilians they will never see their loved ones again will never become easier. In this case, even worse. The husband won‚Äôt even get to do an open casket at the funeral, and on top of that his son‚Äôs missing. Carson and I agreed to not tell him about the feather. Racism in this state has led to a lot of racially motivated murders and since his wife was a white woman we wouldn‚Äôt want him to blame himself for this crime.

‚ÄúYeah, fuck, could you get this one?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYeah I got you man‚Äù I replied.

As we made our way back upstairs, something caught my eye. A sharp tooth, covered in blood at the base of the stairs. I picked it up, observed it with Carson then put it in a zip lock bag to get analyzed by forensics. Once I placed it in the ziplock I noticed I nicked myself on the thumb and was bleeding. Maybe they have a pet I thought? Regardless it probably wasn‚Äôt going to come up with much. As soon as we turned the corner atop the staircase in the empty door frame was a man, presumably John Bodaway covered in dirt and grime being held back by Riggs and two other officers trying to keep him from entering.



‚ÄúAh shit, this one is gonna be rough.‚Äù I stated plainly. Carson just stared blankly to the ground not looking up to meet me or anybody else in the eye. I made my way over.

The man's bright red face looked as though the grief and anger were going to spill molten lava out of every orifice visible to the naked eye. In his blind rage and pain he began¬† shouting more once he saw us.¬†

‚ÄúWhere the fuck is my wife?! I refuse to believe that she's dead, where were you huh where the fuck were you?!‚Äù¬† The husband hollered.

I gestured to Riggs and his men to let him free and I approached the man. I stood face to face with a grieving husband. No matter what he says or does I can‚Äôt fault him because I‚Äôd want to kill anyone if anything like this happened to me and my family.¬†

‚ÄúJohn Bodaway? I work homicide. I am Detective Ralph Irons. I can‚Äôt imagine what your going through right now but‚Äì‚Äù. John punched me squarely in the jaw causing some blood to drop on the spotless flooring.¬†

‚ÄúFuck you pig! Spouting your rehearsed lines, fuck that. Tell me something useful or get the fuck out after I look at the corpse you claim is my wife. And where is my boy?‚Äù He began to cry.

Riggs and his men began to rush towards John and I waved them off. Not wanting to punish this defeated man more than he has already been punished by God and on top of it, they were rehearsed lines. What is this job turning me into? I grabbed him from the top of his shirt below his neck and swore to him.¬†

‚ÄúJohn, we are going to help you. I am sorry. And I swear to you, I will find your boy. From one father to another I won‚Äôt rest till we bring whoever did this to justice.‚Äù¬†

	John looked at me, the pain in his eyes were palpable, he nodded at me. Once I let go of him I asked him if his wife had a black crow tattoo on her ribs. As soon as the words left my mouth his anger washed off his face in an instant and only anguish remained. He confirmed that it was his wife. I said right now we didn‚Äôt have any solid leads or much evidence but since this has happened once before, hopefully the department will give us more time and resources will be used towards finding the killer and his son.

‚ÄúCan I see her? Can I please see my wife's face? I want to apologize to my wife for all my mistakes.‚Äù John pleaded.¬†

I told John he shouldn‚Äôt go down there. I had to tell a father his son was missing and his wife was dismembered in his own home, regardless if they were separated I can only imagine what he‚Äôs going through. After I explained why he couldn't, John collapsed to the ground and started wailing on the hardwood floor till his knuckles were bloodied. Carson was in the corner of the kitchen with his head down.¬†

When tensions lowered, Police escorted John back to his brother's house, afraid of him driving himself. I made sure to get John‚Äôs contact information before he left and I promised him I will give him a call If Carson and I get any leads. When everyone had left Carson walked up to me.

‚ÄúThanks for taking that punch for me.‚Äù With a light smirk.

‚ÄúYeah no problem, want to go get a drink? I could use something for the pain, that big Indian sure can throw a haymaker‚Äù I laughed as much as someone could laugh at a moment like this. How else could anyone make it through a job like this without trying to laugh instead of actually thinking about all the horror? I lied to Carson, the punch didn‚Äôt hurt that bad. I just wanted to blur the image of John‚Äôs wife, or whatever was left of her out of my mind.

‚ÄúYeah sure, I could use one too.‚Äù Carson replied.

The car ride after the bar was silent. The type of silence that's deafening. No amount of alcohol was gonna permanently erase what we both saw that night. Where did that fucking kid go? Despite driving well beyond the legal limit I made it back to the station where we dropped off the tooth to be processed by Kim at forensics. When I parked the car outside of Carson's car, Carson looked at me and paused before stating,



‚Äú You know you shouldn‚Äôt have lied to him. You promised him you‚Äôd find the boy. We have no leads, and the kid from two weeks ago has no trace either. Remember the only reason we even suspected Tallulah Birdinground of having a kid was the walker next to her corpse at the park. We have jack shit.‚Äù

‚Äú I know, but if I was in John‚Äôs shoes right now, I‚Äôd prefer to be lied to.‚Äù

‚ÄúSee ya tomorrow‚Äù, Carson left.

	Cognitive dissonance can be defined as mental discomfort from two or more conflicting attitudes, beliefs, and feelings. That is what it is like coming home to my wife Khalyn after work. To pretend everything is okay when I haven‚Äôt felt okay for a long time. Being married to a cop isn‚Äôt a walk in the park but she made it seem that way. She loved me despite the late nights, despite the nightmares, despite the alcohol on my breath. I didn‚Äôt deserve her. I came home at 1 in the morning and she had her bed side lamp on and waited for me to come home. Her growing excitement for the baby, and I was emotionally unavailable. I have had so much fear of bringing a child into this world. Ever since Keenan.

‚Äú How was work, my love?‚Äù She asked innocently.

	She was the only person in this whole world I could melt to from just her words. I began to weep. I told her I couldn‚Äôt talk to her about it until I was ready but she understood. She understood me completely. I kissed her goodnight and flipped to my side, tears down my cheek, the stench of black coffee, a cigarette, and five Moscow mules still on my tongue. I passed out.¬†

I had a dream last night. I have a unique ability to remember my dreams and I make it a habit to write down what I dreamt of as soon as I wake up. It plays like a movie in my head. I was falling, falling off a cliff into snow. When I hit the ground I didn‚Äôt wake up like I normally would in dreams where I fall. I couldn‚Äôt move, what appeared as red blood spread through the snow surrounding me. I felt warm. In the distance I saw someone or something, on all floors slowly crawling toward me. Simultaneously I heard singing, a chant-like rhythm that vibrated my ears. Children's voices sang the toon. Before I could see what was approaching me I woke up. To my knowledge this is what the children sang.



*‚ÄúOh, Red Woman, child of the flame,*

*Cloaked in silence, never speak her name.*

*In the wind she is dancing, in dreams she is near,*

*A warning, a whisper, a shadow of fear.‚Äù*



The phone rang at 7 AM. It was forensics. They got the lab results back from the tooth.

‚ÄúRalph, The blood on the tooth did belong to Natalie Bodaway. However, we are a bit confused.‚Äù Kim stated.

‚ÄúWhat about?‚Äù I replied

‚ÄúThe tooth you gave us, we tried to age the tooth to get an idea of roughly how old the suspect would be. We weren‚Äôt able to connect it to any DNA in any of our records. So we tried radiocarbon dating. From our estimates, the tooth you gave us came from someone who likely would have died 400 years ago.‚Äù

In a microwave safe jug, add some water, enough to fill your favourite sippy cup/bottle, or reusable coffee cup if your closeted like me. For example, 300ml-300ml and 1/2 is enough to fill mine. (reusable coffee cups make good sippys for closeted littles. Trust me!!) 

Next, add about 1/4 cup powdered milk or more/less depending on how big your sippy cup/bottle is. I use a little scoop and add about 3 and a half scoops. 

Now, mix it all around with a big spoon until the powder has dissolved into all the water. 

Once it's dissolved, add a table spoon of sugar (white, raw or whatever you prefer/have at home. Honey is also a good alternative) then about a capful of Vanilla extract/essence (alcohol free) about a teaspoon or 1/2 teaspoon depending on your preference. 

Mix it all together, then microwave for 30 seconds to a minute or minute and a half depending on your temperature preference. (these are for a 1000w microwaves. If you have more or less, you may need to adjust depending)

Once it's done, mix it around again to make sure the sugar dissolves properly.

The morning sun streamed through our bedroom window, casting golden light across the mahogany dresser where Ricardo had left his briefcase. Ten years. A decade of marriage, of love, of sacrifices I'd made willingly for the man I thought cherished me. I ran my fingers over the leather case, remembering how I'd surprised him with it on our fifth anniversary.

""I'll make coffee,"" I whispered to myself, slipping out of bed. Ricardo had already left for work‚Äîanother early meeting, he'd said. Another late night ahead.

While waiting for the coffee to brew, I noticed his briefcase slightly open. A folder peeked out, marked ""Plaza Manhattan‚ÄîAnniversary Celebration."" My heart skipped. Was this his surprise? The one he'd been hinting at for weeks?

I shouldn't have looked. Some part of me knew that. But ten years deserved trust, didn't it? I slid the folder out, expecting to find reservation confirmations or perhaps a list of musicians for a private concert.

Instead, my hands trembled as I stared at hotel receipts for the Plaza Manhattan's penthouse suite. Not for tonight‚Äîour anniversary‚Äîbut for last night. And the night before. And every night this week.

""Champagne: Dom PÔøΩrignon, 3 bottles @ $750 each...""

""Diamond necklace from Tiffany & Co.: $42,500...""

""Private dinner for two with Executive Chef: $5,200...""

My coffee mug slipped from my fingers, shattering on the tile floor. The brown liquid pooled around my bare feet, hot but not as scalding as the betrayal burning through my chest.

The dates. The extravagant expenses. None of it made sense until I saw the name scrawled on the bottom of one receipt: ""Aisha Robinson.""

My hands shook as I pulled out my phone, searching for images of Aisha Robinson. The search results loaded slowly, each second stretching like an eternity. Then her face appeared‚Äîbeautiful, confident, her hand resting possessively on Ricardo's arm at a charity gala I hadn't attended because Ricardo had insisted I stay home with a headache.

""Aisha Robinson, Ricardo Olson's longtime companion...""

The words blurred as tears filled my eyes. Longtime. How long? One year? Five? Had our entire marriage been a lie?

I called my mother, my voice breaking as I explained. ""I need you to come with me,"" I whispered. ""I can't face this alone.""

Two hours later, we stood in the opulent lobby of the Plaza Manhattan. Mother squeezed my hand, her knuckles white with tension. ""Are you sure about this, Luna?""

""No,"" I admitted. ""But I need to know.""

The hotel buzzed with weekend elegance‚Äîwomen draped in designer dresses, men in tailored suits, champagne flutes clinking at the bar. And then I saw them.

Ricardo stood near the reception desk, his back straight, his dark hair perfectly styled. Beside him, Aisha Robinson laughed, her head thrown back to expose the elegant line of her throat‚Äîadorned with a diamond necklace that caught the light with every movement. At their feet, a boy of about seven or eight fidgeted with an expensive-looking toy.

""Is that‚Äî?"" my mother started.

""Yes,"" I whispered. ""That's Hayes. His son.""

The boy looked up then, his eyes‚Äîso like Ricardo's‚Äîcatching mine across the lobby. His lips curled into a sneer that seemed practiced beyond his years.

""Look, Mommy,"" he said loudly, pointing at me. ""That lady looks like our cleaning lady. The one who smells funny.""

Aisha's eyes followed her son's finger, landing on me with cold recognition. She whispered something to Ricardo, who turned slowly.

For a moment, our eyes met. Ten years of memories flashed between us‚Äîpromises made and, apparently, broken. His expression shifted from shock to calculation in the space of a heartbeat.

""Luna,"" he said, his voice carrying across the lobby. ""What are you doing here?""

""I could ask you the same thing,"" I replied, my voice steadier than I felt. ""On our anniversary, no less.""

Confusion rippled through the nearby guests. Ricardo's jaw tightened, and then he did something I never expected.

""I'm sorry,"" he said loudly, addressing the curious onlookers rather than me. ""This woman is... confused. She's just a cleaning lady who's been stalking me for months.""

The lobby fell silent. Aisha's lips curved into a triumphant smile.

""Ricardo,"" I whispered, disbelief making my voice crack. ""How dare you‚Äî""

""How dare I what?"" he snapped, his public mask slipping. ""You're embarrassing yourself. Go home.""

Hayes stepped forward then, his small face twisted with malice beyond his years. ""You're not allowed here,"" he hissed, and before anyone could react, he shoved my mother hard.

She stumbled backward, her hip connecting with the marble floor with a sickening thud. Her cry of pain echoed through the silent lobby as she lay there, one hand pressed to her side, the other reaching for me.

""Mother!"" I screamed, dropping to my knees beside her.

Hotel security materialized around us, their hands gripping my arms as I tried to reach her. Through tears of rage and grief, I saw Ricardo turn away, Aisha's arm sliding possessively through his as they walked toward the elevators.

""Get them out of here,"" someone ordered, and I felt myself being dragged toward the exit, my mother's whimpers of pain following me like an accusation.

In that moment, something inside me hardened. The Luna who had loved Ricardo Olson died on the cold marble floor of the Plaza Manhattan. In her place rose someone new‚Äîsomeone who would make them all pay for what they'd done today.

Chapter 2

The lobby fell silent as the revolving doors swung open. A tall figure entered, his military dress uniform immaculate, rows of medals gleaming beneath the chandeliers. My brother's presence commanded attention without a single word‚Äîhis posture rigid, his eyes scanning the room with practiced precision. Behind him, two security personnel in dark suits flanked his entrance, their movements synchronized and purposeful.

I was still on my knees beside Mother, whose face had gone pale with pain. The hotel security guards still gripped my arms, but their hold loosened as they noticed the sudden change in atmosphere.

""Sir!"" The hotel manager‚ÄîVictoria Hayes according to her nametag‚Äîrushed forward, her face transforming from contempt to obsequiousness in an instant. ""What an honor‚Äî""

My brother's gaze swept past her, finding me across the lobby. Something in his expression shifted‚Äîa flash of fury quickly masked by cold control.

""Release her,"" he ordered, his voice carrying effortlessly across the marble floor. ""Now.""

The guards holding me exchanged uncertain glances.

""I said, release my sister."" This time, steel edged his tone.

Sister. The word hung in the air like a thunderclap.

Ricardo's face drained of color. He stood frozen, Aisha's arm still looped through his, Hayes half-hiding behind them. I watched as recognition dawned in his eyes‚Äîthe same nose, the same chin, the same proud bearing that had marked our family for generations.

""Colonel King,"" Victoria stammered, her hands trembling as she smoothed her skirt. ""We had no idea‚Äî""

""Clearly."" My brother's gaze swept over Mother's prone form, then to me, taking in my disheveled appearance and tear-stained cheeks. ""My sister and mother were just assaulted in your establishment.""

""Assaulted?"" Victoria's voice rose in panic. ""Sir, there must be some mistake‚Äî""

""No mistake."" My brother's security team had already positioned themselves strategically around us. ""The security footage will confirm everything.""

Ricardo stepped forward, his face a mask of forced calm. ""Colonel King, I assure you this is all a misunderstanding‚Äî""

""Is it?"" My brother turned slowly, studying Ricardo with the same clinical detachment he might give a tactical map. ""I believe you just publicly denied your marriage to my sister. In front of witnesses.""

The lobby had gone completely still. Even the staff pretending to busy themselves at the edges of the room had stopped to watch the unfolding drama.

""Ricardo,"" my brother continued, his voice dropping to a dangerous quiet, ""you have precisely thirty seconds to explain why you've been living off my sister's family connections while treating her like a servant.""

Ricardo's mouth opened and closed. For the first time since I'd known him, he seemed at a loss for words.

""Luna,"" he finally managed, reaching into his pocket. ""This was all a terrible mistake. I was going to surprise you tonight‚Äî""

He pulled out a small velvet box and opened it with trembling fingers. Inside nestled a diamond ring that caught the light in dazzling rainbows. Beside it, he produced a delicate silver bracelet studded with sapphires.

""Ten years,"" he said, his voice taking on that persuasive tone I'd once found so charming. ""We've had our differences, but I never meant‚Äî""

I rose to my feet, ignoring the pain in my knees where they'd pressed against the cold marble. Mother's hand found mine, squeezing gently.

""Take it,"" she whispered. ""And then throw it in his face.""

I took the ring box and the bracelet. For a moment, Ricardo's eyes lit with hope‚Äîthat familiar spark I'd once treasured.

""This,"" I said clearly, so everyone could hear, ""is what you think my dignity is worth.""

I opened my fingers. The ring box fell first, hitting the marble with a sharp crack. The diamond popped free, skittering across the floor like a fallen star. The bracelet followed, silver links scattering.

""Our marriage,"" I continued, my voice steady despite the storm raging inside me, ""is over.""

Ricardo stared at the scattered jewelry, his expression shifting from shock to desperation. Around us, phones were already capturing every moment of his humiliation.

""Luna,"" he pleaded, reaching for my hand. ""Please‚Äî""

I stepped back, positioning myself beside my brother. The message was clear: I was no longer alone.

""Get your things,"" I said. ""And get out of my life.""

As Ricardo's world crumbled around him, I felt something unfamiliar stir within me‚Äînot satisfaction, not yet. But the first fragile seed of what might someday grow into freedom.

Chapter 3

The morning light filtered through the blinds of my home office as I arranged the financial documents on my mahogany desk. Each page represented a piece of the puzzle I'd been quietly assembling for years‚Äîevery transaction, every favor, every connection I'd provided to build Ricardo's empire.

I heard his key in the lock and straightened my spine. The door swung open, revealing my husband of ten years. His confident smile faltered when he saw me waiting.

""Luna,"" he said cautiously, ""I didn't expect you to be here.""

""I've been waiting for you,"" I replied, my voice steady. ""We need to talk.""

Ricardo loosened his tie, his eyes darting to the stack of papers before me. ""About yesterday‚Äî""

""About everything,"" I interrupted. ""Please, sit down.""

He hesitated before taking the chair across from me. I could see the calculation behind his eyes‚Äîassessing, planning, wondering how much I knew.

""I think it's time you understood exactly what you're losing,"" I said, sliding the first document toward him.

Ricardo glanced down at the paper, his brow furrowing slightly. ""What is this?""

""A complete accounting of every marital asset you've diverted to Aisha over the past eight years,"" I said, watching his face carefully. ""Every piece of jewelry, every designer outfit, every vacation. All paid for with our money.""

I pushed another document forward. ""And this is a list of every business deal I helped you secure through my connections.""

His eyes widened slightly. ""Your connections?""

""Yes,"" I said, allowing myself a small smile. ""Did you think those lucrative contracts with defense contractors just fell into your lap? Or that your company's IPO succeeded because of your charm alone?""

I slid forward a third document‚Äîa detailed organizational chart. ""This shows every person in your professional network who owes their position to my family's influence. Every door I opened for you.""

Ricardo's face had gone pale. He stared at the papers, then back at me. ""Luna, I didn't realize‚Äî""

""That I was more than just a supportive wife?"" I finished for him. ""That I've been quietly building your success while you took all the credit?""

He reached for my hand, but I pulled away. ""Don't touch me.""

""I want a divorce,"" I said, my voice cutting through the silence. ""And I want every marital asset returned immediately.""

Ricardo's expression shifted from shock to calculation. ""Luna, be reasonable. We can work through this.""

""Forty-eight hours,"" I said firmly. ""You have forty-eight hours to recover every gift, every piece of jewelry, every cent you've given to Aisha. Or I'll take you to court.""

""You can't‚Äî""

""I can,"" I interrupted. ""And I will.""

A knock at the door interrupted us. My brother entered, his military bearing evident even in casual clothes. He nodded to me before turning his cold gaze to Ricardo.

""Colonel King,"" Ricardo stammered, rising quickly.

""Mr. Olson,"" my brother replied coolly. ""I believe my sister has made her position clear.""

He pulled out his phone, tapping the screen. ""I've just made a few calls to ensure that Luna's legal team receives full cooperation from all relevant parties.""

The threat was clear‚Äîmy family's influence would ensure Ricardo couldn't hide anything.

Ricardo's phone rang suddenly. He glanced at the screen and his face tightened. ""It's Aisha,"" he muttered.

""Answer it,"" I suggested. ""Tell her the truth.""

He did, stepping away from the desk. ""Aisha, we need to talk,"" he began, his voice tense.

I watched as his expression changed from controlled to desperate. ""No, you don't understand. Luna knows everything. She wants everything back.""

My brother stood beside me, his presence a silent reminder of the power I'd never needed to use‚Äîuntil now.

""She's threatening legal action,"" Ricardo continued, pacing the room. ""If you don't return everything, we could both lose everything.""

I could hear Aisha's voice rising from the phone, though I couldn't make out her words.

""No, I'm not choosing her over you,"" Ricardo insisted, his free hand running through his hair. ""Aisha, please‚Äî""

A crash echoed through the phone, followed by a child's scream. ""You promised me!"" Hayes shouted. ""You promised I could have the new gaming system!""

""See what you've done?"" Aisha hissed. ""Our son is upset!""

Ricardo's face contorted with frustration. ""This isn't about gifts anymore! Luna is demanding everything back!""

Another crash, louder this time. ""No!"" Hayes screamed. ""You can't take my stuff! I'll tell Mom about what you did with that woman from your office! And about the money you stole from the company!""

Ricardo's eyes widened in panic. He glanced at me, then quickly away.

""Hayes, stop it!"" Aisha shouted in the background. ""Don't you dare threaten your father!""

But the damage was done. I'd heard enough to know that Ricardo's carefully constructed world was beginning to crumble‚Äîjust as mine had when I discovered his betrayal.

And this was only the beginning of my revenge.",1,1759977886.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

# Espresso Basics

Understanding espresso basics is key to making great iced coffee. Espresso is a strong coffee brewed by forcing hot water through finely-ground coffee beans. This process extracts rich flavors quickly. A good espresso shot is the foundation of delicious iced coffee. Follow simple steps to get the best results.

# Choosing The Right Beans

Start with fresh, high-quality beans. Look for beans labeled ‚Äúespresso roast‚Äù or medium to dark roast. These beans have a bold flavor and good crema. Use beans roasted within the last two weeks. Store them in an airtight container to keep freshness. Fresh beans give your iced coffee a richer taste and aroma.

# Grinding For Espresso

Grind size is crucial for espresso. Use a fine, consistent grind, like table salt texture. Too coarse grind makes weak espresso. Too fine grind causes bitter taste and slow extraction. Use a burr grinder for even grind size. Grind just before brewing to keep flavor fresh.

# Pulling The Perfect Shot

Use about 18-20 grams of coffee for a double shot. Tamp the grounds evenly with firm pressure. Lock the portafilter in the machine. Start the extraction and aim for 25-30 seconds brew time. The espresso should be thick, with golden crema on top. A perfect shot balances bitterness and sweetness, enhancing your iced coffee.

# Preparing Ice And Glassware

Preparing ice and glassware is a key step in making the¬†[best iced coffee](https://gomehedi.com/best-iced-coffee/)¬†with an espresso machine. The right ice keeps your coffee cold without watering it down too fast. Choosing the perfect glass enhances the look and feel of your drink. These simple details make a big difference in your coffee experience.

# Using Ice Cubes Vs Coffee Ice Cubes

Regular ice cubes cool your coffee quickly but melt fast. This can dilute the rich espresso flavor. Coffee ice cubes are made by freezing brewed coffee. They keep your drink cold without losing taste. Using coffee ice cubes is a smart way to keep every sip strong and fresh.

# Selecting The Ideal Glass

Pick a glass that fits your iced coffee style. Tall glasses hold more ice and espresso. They give room for milk or cream too. Clear glass shows off the beautiful layers of your drink. Thick glass keeps your coffee colder longer. Choose a glass that feels good in your hand and suits your serving style.

# Brewing Espresso For Iced Coffee

Brewing espresso for iced coffee requires attention to detail. The espresso shot forms the base of the drink. It must be strong and flavorful to stand up to the ice and milk. Preparing the perfect espresso shot ensures a rich, satisfying iced coffee experience.

# Adjusting Shot Strength

Start by using a slightly stronger espresso shot than usual. This prevents the flavor from becoming weak when poured over ice. Increase the coffee grounds slightly or use a finer grind. Avoid over-extracting, which can cause bitterness. Aim for a balanced, bold shot that complements the cold drink.

# Timing And Temperature Tips

Extract espresso quickly but fully, about 25 to 30 seconds per shot. Use water heated to around 90 to 96 degrees Celsius (194 to 205 degrees Fahrenheit). Avoid using water that is too hot, as it can burn the coffee. Brew espresso immediately before pouring over ice to keep it fresh and hot. This helps preserve aroma and flavor in your iced coffee.

# Combining Ingredients

Combining ingredients is key to making the best iced coffee with an espresso machine. This step controls the flavor, texture, and temperature of your drink. Each ingredient adds a unique touch that makes your iced coffee special and refreshing.

Careful mixing ensures the espresso stays strong and the drink remains cool. The right balance between espresso, ice, milk, and sweeteners creates a smooth and enjoyable coffee experience. Let‚Äôs explore how to combine these ingredients perfectly.

# Pouring Espresso Over Ice

Brew fresh espresso using your machine. Use one or two shots for a strong base. Fill a glass with plenty of ice cubes. Pour the hot espresso slowly over the ice. This cools the espresso fast and locks in the flavor. Avoid stirring immediately to keep the temperature low. The contrast between hot espresso and cold ice gives a rich taste without dilution.

# Choosing Milk And Alternatives

Select cold milk or milk alternatives to add creaminess. Whole milk offers a rich texture and mild sweetness. For lighter options, try skim milk or almond milk. Oat milk works well for a smooth, slightly sweet flavor. Pour the milk gently over the iced espresso. Stir slowly to blend the layers without melting the ice too fast.

# Adding Sweeteners

Add sweeteners to taste for a balanced flavor. Simple syrup dissolves quickly in cold drinks. Honey or agave syrup provide natural sweetness and distinct taste. Use sugar sparingly, as it may not dissolve well in cold coffee. Mix sweeteners into the espresso before pouring over ice for better blending. Adjust the amount to keep your iced coffee smooth and enjoyable.

# Flavor Enhancements

Enhancing the flavor of your iced coffee transforms a simple drink into a delightful experience. Small additions create big changes in taste. Experimenting with different flavor enhancers adds variety and fun. These tweaks let you enjoy your iced coffee exactly how you like it. Below are some easy ways to boost your iced coffee flavor using common ingredients.

# Syrups And Extracts

Syrups add sweetness and unique flavors to your iced coffee. Vanilla, caramel, and hazelnut syrups are popular choices. Add a small amount to your espresso before pouring over ice. Extracts like almond or peppermint provide a subtle taste boost. Use extracts sparingly to avoid overpowering the coffee. These liquid flavorings mix easily and blend well with cold milk or cream.

# Cream And Ice Cream Options

Cream makes iced coffee rich and smooth. Heavy cream or half-and-half work well for a creamy texture. For a treat, add a scoop of vanilla or coffee ice cream. This creates a delicious iced coffee float. Non-dairy creams like coconut or oat cream offer dairy-free alternatives. Whipped cream on top adds extra indulgence and visual appeal.

# Spices And Toppings

Spices bring warmth and depth to iced coffee. Cinnamon, nutmeg, or cocoa powder sprinkle nicely on top. A pinch of sea salt can enhance the coffee‚Äôs sweetness. Crushed nuts or chocolate shavings add crunch and flavor. Fresh mint leaves offer a refreshing twist. These toppings make every sip more exciting and enjoyable.

# Stirring And Serving

Stirring and serving iced coffee made with an espresso machine is a crucial step. It blends flavors and cools the espresso perfectly. Proper stirring ensures a balanced taste without watering down the coffee. Serving it right adds to the overall experience. Let‚Äôs explore effective mixing methods and smart serving ideas.

# Mixing Techniques

Stir gently to avoid breaking ice cubes. Use a long spoon or straw for better reach. Stir until the espresso cools and mixes well with milk or sweetener. Avoid shaking as it can create unwanted foam. For richer flavor, stir in syrup or cream before adding ice. Cold milk or cream helps keep the drink chilled longer.

# Serving Suggestions

Choose a tall glass to hold plenty of ice. Add a straw for easy sipping. Garnish with a small mint leaf or a cinnamon stick for aroma. Serve immediately to enjoy the freshest taste. Use clear glasses to show the beautiful coffee layers. Offer sugar or sweetener on the side for personal taste.

# Portable Iced Coffee Tips

Use an insulated tumbler to keep coffee cold on the go. Freeze coffee cubes to avoid dilution in portable cups. Prepare espresso shots in advance and store in a sealed container. Carry small bottles of milk or creamer separately. Stir well before drinking to mix all flavors evenly. Portable iced coffee stays fresh longer with these simple steps.

# Advanced Tips

Advanced tips help you elevate your iced coffee with an espresso machine. These techniques refine flavor and texture. They bring out the best in every cup.

Try these tricks to customize your iced coffee exactly how you like it. Small changes make big differences.

# Using Ristretto Shots

A ristretto shot uses less water than a regular espresso shot. This makes the coffee richer and more intense. It adds a bold flavor to your iced coffee. Use ristretto shots for a deeper taste without extra bitterness. Perfect for those who prefer strong coffee with a smooth finish.

# Cold Milk Sweetness Adjustments

Cold milk can taste less sweet than warm milk. Adjust sweetness by choosing milk types with natural sugars, like oat or almond milk. Add syrups or simple syrup to the cold milk before pouring. Stir well to mix sweetness evenly. This method keeps your iced coffee balanced and tasty.

# Experimenting With Coffee-to-milk Ratios

The coffee-to-milk ratio changes the strength and creaminess of your drink. Start with equal parts espresso and milk. Adjust to find your perfect balance. More coffee means stronger flavor. More milk creates a smoother, lighter taste. Test different ratios to suit your mood and taste buds.

This isn‚Äôt that serious, and I fear I may just be avoiding necessary conflict.
I(18f) am in my first term of college. My roommate (also 18f) and I were assigned together via random selection. Our room is small. I'm in the room most of the day while she only comes back at night.

I first want to say we made a ‚Äòroommate contract‚Äô where we sated we would keep our respective sides of the dorm clean, taking our trash as needed, etc. I specified taking food trash out immediately and avoiding strong smells as such. she brought a coffee maker, and i had asked her not to make it in the room as the smell upsets me (I am sensitive to strong odors such as food and coffee.)  she had mentioned making it instead in the shared kitchen downstairs, which I said was a good idea and would work best. 
I discussed the issues with her being messy before with my RA and she told me that if it‚Äôs not resolved to come talk to her. 

Over the first few weeks of the term, I have been keeping my side of the dorm clean, taking out the trash, doing laundry, taking care of dishes, and overall keeping my things organized. I clean as I go. My roommate however, cleans once a week. Her laundry piles up on the floor (I have a laundry bin), she leaves dishes sitting for days, and worst of all leaves food trash. Three times so far she has placed a pizza box in the room and let it sit there for a week each. The third time I made sure I reminded her that I do not like having food trash in our room, and it was stinking up the place. 

This week it happened again. I came back from visiting home over the weekend to find her side a mess. Dirty dishes were lying out, empty cans, and a half eaten snack bar in the wrapper on the floor. her trash was overfilled, and a takeaway container was sitting next to it in a bag. I had noticed some of her trash in my bin when I came back as well. Small things like a tag and tooth flossers, but still in my trash can while she has her own.
On Monday morning, (or Sunday, I can‚Äôt remember), she made coffee. That cup, coffee, creamer, and all were left to sit on her desk all the way through today (Wednesday), when she finally tidied up her side of the room. 

This morning she also made coffee, which I noticed way more than I did Monday. It was strong. I had been sleeping in as class had been canceled and I had trouble sleeping the past night. I was rudely awoken to the pungent smell of coffee. I didn‚Äôt say anything as it was early morning, but I struggled to go back to sleep. 

Tonight, when she finally cleaned the room she put more coffee powder into her machine. I don‚Äôt want to have to deal with that smell anymore. I‚Äôve already told her once that the smell bothers me, and twice that the trash bothers me. This is a shared space, and I‚Äôm not feeling respected in it.

Now I knew nothing about propagation and I kind of just snipped off a stem without the node and placed it in this plastic coffee cup.

1o1ukpf,https://instantsalesfunnels.com/ai-sales-script-generator/,My cold email response rate jumped 40% after using an AI sales script generator for cold emails- here‚Äôs what changed!,"I run a small B2B service (web design for local businesses). Cold email is like 60% of how I get clients. But my response rate was terrible - maybe 3-4% on a good day. 

I knew my emails sucked, but I didn‚Äôt know how to fix them. They were too salesy, too long, or too boring. I tried templates from everywhere, but they all felt‚Ä¶ fake. 

What I changed: Started using an AI tool that writes sales scripts using storytelling techniques. Not just ‚ÄúHey, I noticed your website sucks, hire me‚Äù but actual narratives that connect. 

The tool is from InstantSalesFunnels - they have this free AI email generator that‚Äôs based on Gary Hal bert‚Äôs storytelling method. If you don‚Äôt know who that is, he‚Äôs basically the godfather of direct response copywriting. From the Author: I‚Äôve been in affiliate marketing and online sales for 20 years. 

The biggest lesson I‚Äôve learned? People don‚Äôt buy from salespeople - they buy from people they trust. Storytelling builds that trust faster than any feature list ever will. 

Here‚Äôs my new process: 

1. Use the AI tool to generate a story-based email 

2. Customize it with specific details about the prospect

1o1uke3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskParents/comments/1o1uke3/how_do_i_get_through_to_my_mom/,How do I get through to my mom?,"I wasn't sure where to post this so I hope this is okay. I'm very concerned about my mom lately because she seems to be getting more and more obsessed with religion. 

She is 46F while I am 17F. Our family is Hindu but since becoming a teen I've been less and less religious and for the past year I am openly atheist. My mom and dad don't mind at all, but this difference in beliefs has definitely caused some tension with me and my mom because I personally am very strongly against religion while she is a very devout Hindu. (Please do not debate religion in comments I just want advice) 

For the past few months she has been getting more and more into it, and it was frustrating but I just thought this must be normal for religious people and I just don't understand it. She would constantly read religious books and if I ever had a problem, she would give me spiritual or religious advice. I'm very strictly science-based so I would tell her that her advice isn't helpful to me because I don't believe in it (she knows that) and she would try and convince me that religion, god, and supernatural things are real. She completely believes these things are 100% true and that there are no other options, and that this is real science. I'm not saying that there is no possibility of it but I'm saying she refuses to look at scientific ideas and explains everything spiritually. 

For the past few weeks now she has been ONLY reading religious texts. She spent thousands on Hindu books from India, there are about 30 now the size of textbooks that she has been going through. If I ever see her on a device she is reading some sort of spiritual/religious article. She completely stopped watching TV, exercising, or doing anything else. She wakes up at 4 am everyday when she sleeps at 11-12 pm at night and she gets little to no sleep, and even after doing the math with her today and trying to explain it wasn't enough sleep and she could get sick she didn't listen to me and just ignored me, she just started saying something else. She never hosts religious meets but she hosted her first one last weekend and the people who came were extremely weird, it felt like a cult meeting, this couple didn't even call each other by name but rather religious titles of husband and wife. 

She has changed her diet a lot, cutting out onions and lemon/lime which are things in almost every Indian dish and she stopped drinking coffee completely. I just talked to my dad 30 minutes ago and he said he feels like she's getting brainwashed, and now I'm realizing that this isn't in my head. I don't know how to get through to her. 

I'm sorry if I just started rambling at the end, there is so much to say but I couldn't put it all. I keep crying typing this because I never had the best relationship with my mom but now I just feel so scared and she doesn't even feel like my mom anymore. She feels like someone else and I feel so scared.

Please do not start debating whether religion is positive or negative I just want to know how to get through to my mom and show her she's hurting herself.",0,1759977146.0,AskParents,1,0.5,False

1o1uja3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Narcolepsy/comments/1o1uja3/anyone_else_notice_significant_improvement_with/,Anyone else notice significant improvement with unisom?,"
Disclaimer: I believe there is some pretty good research that shows correlation between chronic use of some antihistamines with the development of Alzheimer's later in life. Benadryl (diphenhydramine HCl) is specifically listed  from what I've heard. Personally, I'm assuming that the unisom is in the same class and carries the same risk, though I haven't fact-checked this assumption.

(N2 without cataplexy) recently traveled outside of the US and on my way back I picked up a cold. Then suddenly had the first ""normal feeling"" days since I got diagnosed 4 months ago. I jokingly thought to myself ""dang I need to get a cold more often"". After having several really good days I started thinking back about what besides the cold had been different. The only thing that had changed was I was taking NyQuil. After the cold went away I switched to unisom and started having the good ""almost normal"" days consistently. 

This was obviously very exciting. I talked to my doctor and shared the discovery, expecting that this new information would indicate the proper nighttime medication to get my symptoms fully under control (10 being normal, with unisom I was consistently hitting ~8 everyday). 

This is what my schedule looked like after adding the unisom.

Morning:
    - modafinil (generic, 200mg)
    - creatine (momentous, 5g)
    - coffee (~150mg caffeine)

Noon:
    - modafinil (generic, 200mg)
    - creatine (momentous, 5g)
    - coffee (~150mg caffeine)

Night:
    - Unisom (doxylamine succinate 25mg)
    - Magnesium (magnesium glycinate 210mg)

I had already spoken with the jazz cares pharmacist about xywav and decided for now to explore other options. My doctor basically gave me two options: lumryz (oxybate) and trazodone (antidepressant). I found this kind of surprising since I know there are other types of sleep medication out there and from talking to her it didn't sound like either of these worked the same way that the unisom does. 

Ultimately we decided to start with the trazodone. It hasn't worked well. Immediately upon switching I dropped from having good days ~8 (able to perform) to having ""just days"" ~4-5 (able to safely stay conscious). The trazodone also made it significantly harder to actually get up in the morning and left me groggy for much longer. Very disappointing.

Having recently been fired from my job due to complications from my narcolepsy, I really need to be able to ""perform"" and not just ""stay safely conscious"". I've chosen the phrase ""safely conscious"" because the job I just lost required me to operate company vehicles and the reason they fired me was uncertainty that I could ""stay safely conscious"". Yesterday I switched back to the unisom and today has been significantly better (~7) despite accidentally staying up late last night and not sleeping as long as I usually do. 

Has anyone else has had a similar experience with unisom (or other)? Obviously unisom is not a good long-term solution chronic use is linked to Alzheimer's. If anyone has had an experience like this, specifically with unisom and then found something else (besides oxybates) that gave similar results please let me know :)

1o1uitj,https://i.redd.it/olhhteo4zztf1.png,"Comes Too Late: Sorry Honey, Your Backup Wife is Actually a FAN-FAVE News Anchor","I was this close to landing the primetime anchor chair on The Five when Fox News dropped a bombshell‚Äîsome stunning University ofMunich grad named Sarah Donovan, parachuted in like the golden girl corporate had been waiting for.



Then my boss Dylan threw down the challenge: ""Whoever gets an exclusive interview with New York's kingmaker Thaddius Huston gets the job.""



I smirked.



This was in my bag.



Thaddius wasn't just another untouchable powerbroker‚Äîhe was my husband. My secret, yes. But still mine.



At least, that‚Äôs what I thought.

Because when the news alert hit my phone, it wasn‚Äôt my name on the headline.

‚ÄúHuston Speaks: Exclusive Interview with Sarah Donovan.‚Äù

The kicker?



Sarah Donovan wasn't just some random pretty face.



She was his college sweetheart.



His precious first love.



Game over.



You know what?



Screw this whole mess.



I stormed straight into the Dylan's office and volunteered for the most dangerous assignment we had‚Äîwar correspondent in Eastern Ukraine.



‚ÄúPut me on the next plane to Ukraine,‚Äù I said.



He blinked. ‚ÄúAre you serious? That‚Äôs a war zone.‚Äù



I smiled, fierce and unshaken. ‚ÄúExactly. If I can‚Äôt take primetime here, I‚Äôll carve my name out there.‚Äù



If I can't have the anchor desk, I'll build something bigger. Something that's entirely mine.



Because here‚Äôs the truth: men can betray you, love can humiliate you‚Äîbut your career, your name, your fire? That‚Äôs yours alone to claim.



Thaddius Huston‚Äîthis time, I‚Äôm choosing myself.



Not you.





Chapter 1





The office erupted the moment Sarah Donovan walked in. People swarmed around her like she'd just walked off a magazine cover. Even the Dylan's eyes lit up with obvious admiration.





""Well, that's Munich excellence for you.""





""Congratulations, Sarah. Yesterday's assignment‚Äîexclusive with Thaddius Huston‚Äîlocked down today.""





Everyone in the States knew his rules: Thaddius Huston didn't do interviews. Huston Industries didn't need press coverage‚Äîhe was the brand.





Sarah's lips curved into that perfect, confident smile.





""Just doing what I'm paid for.""





The whole newsroom was losing their minds. Since Thaddius took over his family's empire, he'd shut out every single media outlet.





I forced a smile, but inside? I was seething. Five years at Fox News. Five damn years, and I was one step away from hosting The Five.





Her introduction had been textbook perfect.





""Hey everyone, I'm Sarah Donovan.""





""Fresh off Munich, but I'll be honest, zero experience in broadcasting before.""





""Hope you'll all show me the ropes.""





Sweet. Humble. Everyone bought it completely.





A slight, almost imperceptible smirk curved her lips. Smug. Deliberate.





Dylan called us both into the office.





‚ÄúNatalie,‚Äù he started, ‚Äúwe want an exclusive with Thaddius Huston. So here‚Äôs the challenge.‚Äù





‚ÄúWhoever lands this interview takes the primetime anchor seat.‚Äù





My chest tightened in a thrill. I had this. Thaddius wasn't just some CEO to me. He was my secret husband.





As we stepped out, Sarah extended her hand.





""Good to officially meet you, Natalie.""





""Just call me Sarah.""





I raised an eyebrow. She already knew my name? Her whole arrival felt way too targeted. Like she'd come here specifically for me.





I kept my expression neutral. ""Natalie Collins. Just Natalie's fine.""





We swapped numbers and headed toward the elevators. Right before we stepped outside, she turned to me.





""Natalie.""





""Game on.""





Just an anchor gig, but her eyes were burning with pure hunger.





Like we weren't just fighting over a job.





Like this was war.





Chapter 2





Last night, Thaddius stumbled through our front door reeking of top-shelf whiskey, his cheeks flushed that telltale red. His tailored shirt clung to every muscle, jacket slung carelessly over his arm like some GQ cover shot.





The foyer lighting hit his face just right‚Äîsharp jawline, those impossibly dark eyes under thick brows that made half of Manhattan swoon.





He barely glanced up. ""What?""





No ""hey babe."" No ""how was your day."" Just \*what\*.





I didn't waste time with small talks. ""I need that interview.""





He paused, eyebrows drawing together slightly. After a moment of silence:





""Natalie.""





‚ÄúI don‚Äôt do interviews. Not to anyone. No exceptions.‚Äù





When management handed down that challenge, I thought it was a done deal. Thaddius was my husband‚Äîsecret or not, I thought that meant something.





Wrong.





Sitting there, completely humiliated, I went for gamble.





""Not even for your WIFE?""





He didn't even hesitate. ""Not even for my wife.""





My throat choked, but I forced the words out. ‚ÄúGot it.‚Äù





I tried to convince myself if I couldn‚Äôt land it, then Sarah Donovan didn‚Äôt stand a chance either.





Joke's on me.





The next morning, our news director dropped the bomb: Sarah had locked the Huston exclusive.





The room erupted. Applause, disbelief, cheers.





Meanwhile, I sat frozen, staring at my desk like I‚Äôd forgotten how to breathe.





Miranda leaned close, squeezing my arm.





‚ÄúNat, don‚Äôt you blame yourself up. This was wired from the start. She‚Äôs a plant, and everyone knows it.‚Äù





But my gut twisted, this wasn't just about losing the promotion‚Äîthis was about my own husband choosing some other woman over me.





And when I found out Sarah wasn‚Äôt just anybody‚Äîshe was his first love? That was the knife.





Sarah wasn't just after my anchor chair.





She was after my own HUSBAND.





After her little victory lap, Sarah played the humble card perfectly. The second Dylan left, she smiled brightly.





""Starbucks run, anyone? My treat!""





The office went wild. Landing Thaddius meant quotas smashed, bonuses doubled, job security guaranteed.





Sarah wasn‚Äôt just the new girl anymore.





She was the newsroom‚Äôs golden ticket.





""Holy shit, Sarah,"" Jake from sports gushed, ""you actually tamed the untameable. How the hell‚Äî""





Sarah's smile could've powered Times Square. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve known each other a long time.""





The words were casual, but her eyes locked on mine for one brutal second. That little smirk said LONG TIME.





The room practically vibrated with gossip.





""Wait, wait,"" Amanda from lifestyle leaned in, ""are you two...?""





""Hold up,"" someone else interrupted, ""isn't he married? Like, super secretly married?""





Sarah didn‚Äôt confirm or deny. Just that coy sparkle in her eyes before she waved it off. ""Just text me your orders, guys.""





Within minutes, she was everyone's new best friend. When the dinner invites rolled in, she laughed softly and shook her head.





""Thanks, but I‚Äôve got plans tonight. Just a welcome-back dinner.""





""Old friend's treating me to the full New York experience.""





""Old friend?"" someone echoed, suspicious, ""please tell me it's not Thaddius Huston, right?""





Sarah just blinked those innocent doe eyes, saying absolutely nothing.





That's when my phone lit up. Thaddius: ""Client dinner. Don't wait up.""





Three years of secret marriage.





Three years of him being the perfect husband‚Äîloyal, respectful, always checking in. Never so much as a whisper of scandal.





But every instinct I had was screaming the same thing:





Tonight‚Äôs ""welcome-back dinner""?





It had Thaddius written all over it.





Chapter 3





It's impossible not to be curious about your husband's first love.





Sarah was the kind of gorgeous that should come with a warning label‚Äîintimidating, untouchable, like she'd cut you down with one look. But in person? Total opposite. Warm, bubbly, the girl who'd remember your coffee order after meeting you once.





That kind of contrast? It made everyone think she was an absolute angel.





Her Instagram was a whole different story. Miss Perfect had a chatty side‚Äîposting every random thought, mirror selfies, vacation dumps, the full millennial package.





Then I saw his username in her likes, and my world tilted.





Thaddius\_Huston.





Not just casual likes either. Consistent engagement going back months. His inner circle was all over her comments too‚Äîinside jokes, references that screamed we go way back.





Six months of scrolling painted the whole picture. These people had history.





I was about to close the app when a fresh post appeared. Group dinner at some ridiculously expensive Manhattan spot, Sarah glowing in the center of what looked like New York's power elite.





Thaddius wasn't in the shot.





But there, barely visible in the corner‚Äîa familiar arm wearing a green Rolex Submariner that cost more than most people's cars.





My husband's fucking watch.



""Most incredible welcome-back dinner ever! Love my NYC family! ""



Within minutes, half our Fox News crew was in the comments.



""Sarah!! Living your best life with the 1% now!""



Her reply was sickeningly perfect: ""You're all VIPs in my book! ""



Three days. It took her three goddamn days to worm her way into half my life. She was everywhere.



For three years, I'd been the perfect wife. Left the hallway light on every single time Thaddius worked late. Tonight, I stood there staring at that switch like it held all the answers before killing it.



Screw the light. And screw him.



I was pretending to sleep when the shower started running. Then those familiar footsteps crossing our bedroom. The mattress dipped as he slid in, still radiating heat from the hot water.



His voice sliced through the darkness, smooth as always. ""No light tonight?""



I yanked the bedside lamp off so hard I nearly broke the switch.



""Forgot.""



He moved closer, smelling like that ridiculously expensive body wash and something distinctly him‚Äîthe scent that used to make me melt on contact.



His arm wrapped around my waist from behind, pulling me flush against his chest like he owned me.



For one traitorous second, my body wanted to give in. Then reality slammed back.



Slowly, deliberately, I peeled each of his fingers away and shoved his hand off like it burned.



""I'm exhausted, Thaddius.""



His voice dropped to that low rumble that used to be my kryptonite. ""That's fine.""



""I'll just hold you.""



Hold me. Like I was some fragile thing that needed protecting. Like he hadn't just spent the evening with his ex-girlfriend while lying to my face about it.

""Wonderful! I‚Äôll start preparing your visa right away."" My mother sounded delighted but paused before cautiously asking, ""But if you go to Italy, you and Vincent will have a long-distance relationship. Will he be okay with that?""



Thinking of Vincent, a surge of pain briefly flashed through my eyes before settling into quiet resolve.

""I‚Äôm planning to break up with him. I won‚Äôt ever see him again.""





Love Story1-Chapter 1





""Kaylee, mom and dad have been searching for you for 7,236 days, and we've finally found you!""





In Evergreen Cemetery, a well-dressed, elegant woman clung to my hand, crying her heart out.





""All these years you've been lost, your father and I have been searching for you around the world. Each day was a painful wait. Now that we've finally found you, and since your adoptive parents' affairs have been settled, would you be willing to come to Italy and live with us?""





Hearing the hopeful tone in my mother's voice, I glanced at the tombstone engraved with the kind smiles of my adoptive parents, my eyes red, unable to make a decision.





""I'll think about it.""





For now, I still wasn't ready to adapt to the identity of a billionaire's daughter after living as an ordinary girl for so long.





""No problem. We'll wait for your answer.""





After parting ways with my mother, I returned to my apartment at Seasides.





I opened the door to find the yellow roses in the vase on the entryway cabinet withered and a thick layer of dust coating the table.





Even the clothes on the sofa remained exactly as they were before I left.





I had been away for seven days attending a funeral, and Vincent Garc√≠a had been unreachable for seven days.





I took a deep breath and scrolled through our contact log on my phone.





Thirteen calls, twenty-one WhatsApp voice calls, all with the same response: ""No answer.""





Out of habit, I opened Instagram and saw Vincent's junior colleague, Alina Clark, had just posted an update:





""Watching the sea with the person I love, and he's gentler than the ocean today.""





The picture showed her and Vincent camping by the sea, watching the sunset.





Staring at the image, my swollen eyes felt like something shattered within them.





I recalled my mother asking if I wanted to settle in Italy, and I had actually considered it for Vincent's sake. But now, it just seemed laughable.





Kaylee Anderson, your love life is truly a failure!





‚ÄòDa!'





The door lock clicked.





Vincent returned in casual attire. Seeing me sitting dazed on the sofa, he quickly asked, ""Kaylee, why are your eyes so red?""





I looked at him, his clear gaze reflecting my sorrowful expression.





""I just got something in my eye,"" I replied hoarsely, then asked, ""Where have you been these past few days?""





His expression faltered slightly at my question.





""A new project came up at the lab, and I've been so busy I couldn't come home. I finally wrapped it up today.""





He watched my face, his tone concerned. ""I didn't have my phone with me in the lab, so it was only on my way back that I saw all the calls from you. Was something urgent?""





My tightly clenched fingers pressed hard into my palm as I held back my emotions.





""Nothing urgent‚ÄîI accidentally dialed a few times, that's all.""





I walked over to the entryway, pulling out the wilted yellow roses and tossing them in the trash.





I had given Vincent the chance to tell the truth, but he chose to lie instead.





So, without revealing his poor excuse, I quietly went to my room to rest.





Vincent seemed unsettled, quickly following me. ""You look pale. Is it your period of this month?""





I paused.





He used to know my period date was at the end of the month, and always preparing hot milk and heating pads to soothe my cramps.





But now, it was only the middle of the month.





Watching his concerned face, I felt a coldness spreading through me.





""No, I just didn't sleep well yesterday.""





Unconcerned, Vincent took his pajamas and went to shower. ""Then get some rest early tonight.""





The sound of running water echoed from the bathroom as a dampness crept into my heart.





A notification sounded from my bedside table.





I glanced over to see a message from ""Sailor Moon"" with the flashing profile picture of a crescent moon.





""Vincent, the ocean romance has been received. Don't forget you promised to take me hiking to watch the sunrise next week!""





One glance at that message sent a dull ache through my heart.





He saved Alina's contact as ""Sailor Moon."" They watched the sunset by the ocean, and now they're planning to watch the sunrise in the mountains‚Äîhow romantic!





Clenching my fists, I forced myself to remain calm.





With a quick glance at the closed bathroom door, I walked into the living room and dialed my mother's number.





""Mom, I'll come to Italy with you after I get my diploma at the end of the month.""





""Wonderful! I'll start preparing your visa right away."" My mother sounded delighted but paused before cautiously asking, ""But if you go to Italy, you and Vincent will have a long-distance relationship. Will he be okay with that?""





Thinking of Vincent, a surge of pain briefly flashed through my heart before settling into quiet resolve.





""I'm planning to break up with him. I won't ever see him again.""





Chapter 2





My mother seemed to sense the slight catch in my voice and gently comforted me.





""You've been with him for four years, yet when your adoptive parents both passed away in that car accident, he didn't even go to accompany and care for you. You're better off without a man like that. There are plenty of eligible bachelors in Italy. When the time comes, your father and I can help you find someone‚Äîyou'll have your pick.""





""Alright, I'll pack up over the next couple of weeks. I'll meet you at the airport.""





Just as I ended the call, the bathroom door opened, and Vincent emerged with a towel wrapped around his waist.





""Who are you meeting at the airport?"" he asked.





I paused, looking down slightly. ""My mother.""





As he put on his pajamas, Vincent said, ""If your mom's coming to Seattle, I'll set up a dinner to welcome her.""





He assumed I meant my adoptive mother, and for a moment, I didn't feel the need to clarify everything.





I glanced at the date on my phone: June 15.





Only fifteen days left until I left for Italy.





""Talk about it later,"" I replied vaguely.





Vincent murmured a half-hearted ""hmm"" and returned his gaze to his phone, his face relaxed, occasionally breaking into a soft smile. I looked away, lying down with my eyes closed.





After some time, I heard him set down his phone and felt him slide closer, wrapping his arm around me.





My body stiffened, and I instinctively pulled his hand away.





""Babe, are you mad because I didn't answer your calls? I'll make sure to keep my phone on me from now on so I won't go off the grid again."" Vincent seemed to sense something was off, trying to coax me gently.





""No, I'm not mad. I'm just really tired.""





I kept my tone flat, unwilling to say more.





But inside, I silently told him:





Vincent, there is no ""next time"" for us.





The night was quiet, and his gentle breathing filled the room, but I couldn't sleep. Thoughts of the ""Sailor Moon"" in his phone haunted me, and I made up my mind.





I got up, picked up his phone, unlocked it, and opened WhatsApp.





Originally, I was the only pinned contact, but now it was both me and ""Sailor Moon,"" with her chat sitting at the top. Their latest messages were goodnight texts right before he slept.





My hands trembled as I scrolled through Vincent and Alina's chat history, realizing they'd been messaging daily for an entire year.





He'd spent Valentine's Day with me, yet he'd still sent her pictures of the food we shared.





He'd watched movies with me, only to text her later about whether it was worth seeing, even taking her for a second viewing the next day.





Even after our late nights together, he would share folk music with her as if he were a pure-hearted young man.





Each page of their chat clashed with my memories of our relationship, tearing me apart inside. I didn't understand it.





The man who looked at me with such genuine love‚Äîhow could he share those intimate details with someone else while claiming to love me?





I stayed up all night.





The next morning, as I finished preparing breakfast, I checked the reminder on my phone.





Today marked four years with Vincent.





Six months ago, we had planned a trip to Disneyland to celebrate.





With fourteen days left until I left, I decided to end things there, bringing closure to our four years together.





At the dining table, Vincent was scrolling on his phone as he ate. I couldn't hold back. ""Couldn't that wait until after breakfast? You have a flight to catch, remember?""





He absentmindedly replied, ""Flight? Are you going somewhere today?""





For a moment, I froze, realizing he'd forgotten our Disneyland plans and the significance of today.





I had intended to part on good terms, but now I just felt foolish.





Forcing a smile, I said, ""It's nothing. I'm just seeing off a friend.""





Vincent didn't ask further.





At that moment, his phone screen lit up. I glanced over instinctively and saw a message from ""Sailor Moon"":





""I'm so hungry! Where's my breakfast?""





Vincent quickly grabbed his phone, taking two egg crepes from the table and glancing at me with a guilty look.





""My advisor needs me for something. I'm heading to the lab.""





Watching him leave in a hurry, I let out a silent laugh.





He could barely even lie convincingly. He really couldn't wait.





I picked up my phone and canceled the Disneyland tickets I had booked months ago.





On Instagram, I opened Alina's new post:





""I said I was hungry, and my boyfriend showed up downstairs with a homemade breakfast right away!""





I felt a chill wash over me.





Homemade by him?





How absurd!





I couldn't eat anymore.





I got up and threw the remaining breakfast into the trash, along with the last traces of affection I had for Vincent.





Chapter 3





I never doubted love, but love can change in an instant.





Especially after four years.





This relationship had already soured‚ÄîI should have realized it sooner.





But love makes you blind.





I pulled out a large cardboard box and opened the storage cabinet that filled an entire wall.





Inside, there were remnants of our love‚ÄîKuromi plaster figurines we painted on rainy days, handmade pottery projects, bracelets, and phone cases.





The wall was covered in photos, a visible timeline of our four years together.





From our early days of warm embraces to later photos where we only posed with half-hearted peace signs.





I didn't even know when Vincent's heart had started to change.





I took a deep breath, wiping the redness from the corners of my eyes, then tossed everything from the cabinet, piece by piece, into the box.





I tore down every photo from the wall as well.





The yellowed adhesive left stark marks on the white wall, mirroring my scarred, fractured heart.





As I packed, memories surfaced, and daylight slowly faded.





Once the box was filled, I took it downstairs to the dumpster, then lay on the sofa, exhausted.





After some time, the door opened.





Vincent walked in, turning on the lights in the living room.





Seeing me curled up on the sofa, he hurried over.





""Kaylee, why are you sleeping here? You'll catch a cold!""





His concern seemed genuine, with no trace of pretense.





I stared at him for three seconds before looking away.





""I was cleaning the house and fell asleep accidentally.""





Vincent glanced around the room, noticing the changes.





""Did you throw away a lot of stuff? It feels emptier.""





I nodded lightly.





""Graduation's here; it's time to throw out the old and bring in the new.""





Graduation season is not only a time for decluttering but also for breakups.





Anything tied to the past had to go, along with the traces of a love that no longer held meaning.





""Alright, we can go shopping together later and redecorate our little nest.""





Vincent nodded, not giving it much thought.





Watching his casual demeanor, I felt a slight ache in my chest.





If he'd looked a bit more closely, he'd have noticed that everything missing was part of our couple's collection or love mementos‚Äîthings I'd never discard without a reason.





But he was too busy texting to notice anything.





After all, Alina filled his thoughts now.





A notification pinged on his phone.





Vincent glanced down, and his expression shifted.





""Kaylee, today's our anniversary! Why didn't you remind me? Did you forget too?""





Only then did I realize that his phone's calendar had reminded him of today's date.





Hearing his reproach, I felt a dull weight settle inside me.





""You seemed too busy, so I didn't mention it.""





I had reminded him this morning, but someone preoccupied wouldn't have registered it.





Sensing my indifference, Vincent looked a bit uneasy.





""Babe, that was my fault. Let's make it up another day, like we used to, with all the ceremony and excitement.""





He gently held my hand, trying to appease me with a soft tone.





Just then, his phone rang again.





It was a voice call from ""Sailor Moon.""





He instinctively declined the call, but Alina dialed right back.





Seeing his guilty expression, I gave him an excuse to leave.





""Go ahead and take it; it could be urgent from the lab.""





After all, the lab had always been his go-to excuse whenever he had to step out unexpectedly.





This time, I said it myself to save him the trouble of lying again.





Vincent hesitated, then quickly went to the balcony to answer the call.





When he returned, he gave me a light hug and said softly, ""You really understand me. It was an urgent lab issue. I need to go handle it and wrap up this project.""





""When things settle down, I'll take you out for a proper anniversary celebration. We'll stay in the Disney castle, and I'll make you feel like a princess.""





I turned slightly away from his embrace, lowered my gaze, and nodded.





""Okay.""





It was a simple response, devoid of any expectation.





I had long since stopped believing in his promises.





But when I saw a red notification on Instagram, I instinctively opened it.





Alina had posted a new update‚Äî





The picture showed Vincent sipping coffee in the lab's break room.





""Sharing the same cup of coffee with my boyfriend, more intimate than a kiss.""

At this point I think I might just drink nectar juices diet coke and coffee just say f to eating food what's the point. How about I eat food but never swallow it then I could lose weight still ""eat"" for by taste then drink calories because this is just ridiculous to have. Oh and the polyps that they found were just from having high cholesterol so it's almost like I got my gallbladder removed for nothing. ",1,1759976813.0,gallbladders,0,1.0,False

I guess insomnia is just what you have to expect in my situation. What's weird is that sleep gets worse when I don't drink coffee or when I meditate seriously.  It seems as if my insomnia worsens when I take steps to slow down my nervous system. Why is that? One theory I have is that calming down the mind makes it introspective, which in turn makes it realize what kind of trouble I'm in psychologically. Being stimulated by caffeine, working as hell and going crazy makes me sleep a bit more because it makes me forget myself and the world. But by doing that I hit the wall from time to time and have to take time off work to just survive. And then, when trying to calm down my life and feel safe again, boom - I wake up after two hours every night, brain activated, same old. How do you solve this?",3,1759976631.0,insomnia,4,1.0,False

1o1udo4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Habits/comments/1o1udo4/why_your_life_is_so_boring_and_how_to_fix_it/,Why your life is so boring (and how to fix it),"I used to think my life was boring because nothing exciting was happening to me. I'd scroll through social media watching other people live these amazing lives while I sat on my couch doing the same thing every day.

Then I realized something that changed my perspective. It was that **my life wasn't boring because nothing was happening it was boring because I was avoiding everything that made me uncomfortable.**

Here's what's actually making your life feel empty:

Watching other people live instead of living yourself. YouTube vlogs, Instagram stories, TikTok trends you're consuming everyone else's experiences instead of creating your own. Your brain knows the difference between watching and doing. Vicarious living gives you none of the satisfaction of actual experiences.

Do one thing this week that makes you slightly nervous. Try a new restaurant alone. Talk to a stranger. Take a different route home. Real life happens when you participate.

You've optimized all the friction out of your life

Same coffee, same commute, same lunch spot, same weekend routine. You've eliminated all uncertainty and novelty. Your brain stops encoding memories when nothing changes. That's why time feels like it's flying by you're not creating distinct experiences to remember.

Break one routine this week. Order something different. Take a class. Go somewhere new. Novel experiences make time feel fuller and life feel richer.

You're waiting for permission to do what you want

""I'll travel when I have more money."" ""I'll start that hobby when I have more time."" ""I'll make friends when I'm in a better place."" You're postponing your life until conditions are perfect. They never will be.

You say no to everything that involves effort

Turning down invitations, avoiding plans that require driving somewhere, choosing Netflix over going out.

Comfort is the opposite of interesting. Every time you choose easy over uncertain, you're choosing boring over memorable.

Say yes to the next invitation even if it sounds exhausting. Most memorable experiences start with ""I didn't feel like going, but I'm glad I did.""

You're not learning anything new

Consuming the same type of content, talking to the same people, thinking the same thoughts on repeat.

Growth feels like aliveness. Stagnation feels like death. When you stop learning, you stop living.

Learn one new skill this month. Doesn't matter what cooking, language, instrument, coding. The act of being bad at something new makes you feel alive.

You're addicted to low-effort dopamine

Scrolling, snacking, binging shows activities that require zero effort and give instant gratification.

High-dopamine activities make everything else feel dull by comparison. Real life can't compete with algorithmically optimized content.

Cut one digital dopamine source for a week. When you lower your baseline stimulation, regular life becomes interesting again.

You have no goals worth getting excited about

By far the most important lesson is this. Going through motions without working toward anything specific. No projects, no challenges, no ""I can't wait until...""

Anticipation is what makes life feel full. When you have nothing to look forward to, every day feels the same.

You're avoiding discomfort at all costs

Choosing familiar over unknown, safe over risky, comfortable over challenging.

Stories are born from discomfort. ""Everything went according to plan"" has never been an interesting story.

Do one uncomfortable thing weekly. Have a difficult conversation. Try something you might be bad at. Ask for what you want. Discomfort is where life gets interesting.

I started saying yes to things that scared me a little. I took classes where I was the worst one. I traveled alone. I talked to strangers. I tried hobbies I might suck at.

**My life didn't become perfect.** But it became interesting.

I have stories now. I have experiences. I have things I'm working toward and excited about.

Your life gets interesting the moment you stop waiting for interesting things to happen to you. 

I hope this post motivates you to do the same as well",2,1759976596.0,Habits,0,1.0,False

When I was 8 we were adopted. Nice parents, good home. I never felt a connection with them. There was no talking about things it was always just small talk. As I grew up more and more tension in the family grew. I was an angry and sad teen and my adoptive father was a short fused military man who had picked up heavy drinking. I didn‚Äôt under that I had depression or what it was. I just hated myself. I hated everyone. I was just told these feelings go away as you get older. At some point I was kicked out and joined the army. Im a smalller guy who likes to yap and that (plus some poor decisions) got me a lot of enemies. I made a lot of mistakes but nothing that hurt anyone else. 

Every relationship I had, romantic or not, had problems. People didn‚Äôt make sense to me. Nobody did. The hatred for myself grew deeper. I couldn‚Äôt order a coffee without hating what I said or how I interacted with people. I was always the after thought in any friend group. Never the center. Never missed if I didn‚Äôt show up. 

After the army I went home. Diagnosed with severe depression. Tried to kill myself. Ran into someone who literally talked me off the edge. I went to a hospital where I sat for weeks until I realized nothing was going to happen there and said I was feeling better u til I could leave. The eggshells people stepped on around me were audible. If I thought there was any semblance of self to re acquire than that all was dismissed after just a couple conversations. 

Eventually time moved on. I started working. Things seemed up. I got promoted, bought a big house and moved my friends in during Covid. But this house was expensive. Nothing I couldn‚Äôt afford but still expensive. and‚Ä¶ my company went under. Me and my 3 friends were left unemployed. The mortgage went unpaid. I had a girlfriend but she lived with her parents and really didn‚Äôt understand life with bills and money. She moved in to help with things after a few years but I had struggled finding consistent work and the bills were so far behind. The house foreclosed and sold for a fraction of what I owe. A good house sold for Pennie‚Äôs‚Ä¶ and of course I owe the rest to the bank. The darkness is growing. I see no way out. I feel like I‚Äôm climbing an endless ladder that‚Äôs collapsing into the hole I‚Äôm trying to climb out of.

every single day started with me feeling anxious, overwhelmed, and already behind before i even stood up. my brain was fried before breakfast.

the breaking point came when i realized i couldn't remember the last time i woke up feeling good. like genuinely energized and ready for the day. it had been months, maybe years. i was starting every morning by flooding my brain with other people's problems, news, drama, and comparison.

decided to try something extreme. put my phone charger in the bathroom instead of next to my bed. couldn't check it until after i brushed my teeth and washed my face. that's it. no willpower test every morning, just physically harder to grab. first day was brutal. hand automatically reached for the nightstand. nothing there. felt weird. anxious even. but i got up, did my bathroom routine, and by then the urge had passed.

managed 4 days. then a week. then it just became normal. now it's been 8 months. what actually changed: i started doing things in the morning. like actual things. made coffee slowly instead of rushing. read physical books. went for walks. had real conversations with my partner instead of both of us staring at screens. but here's the weirdest part - when i don't start my day with my phone, i barely want it during the day either. it's like that first scroll session was programming my brain to crave it all day long. break that cycle and suddenly i'm not constantly reaching for it.

my screen time went from 7-8 hours daily to around 2-3 hours. and most of that now is actually useful stuff like maps, music, or texting people i care about. not mindless consumption.

the morning sets the template. if you start reactive and distracted, you stay reactive and distracted. if you start intentional and present, the rest follows. if you're stuck in the morning scroll trap, just try moving your charger across the room for 3 days. that's it. don't try to quit your phone entirely or become some productivity robot. just make it slightly harder to grab first thing. you'll be shocked at how different your days feel.",4,1759976476.0,Procrastinationism,0,0.84,False

What if you could discover Chengdu not by rushing through landmarks, but by walking lazily through its streets‚Äîsoaking in the smells, the colors, and the rhythm of local life?

This is a ‚Äúlazy version‚Äù citywalk: light on your feet, yet rich in atmosphere.

üìç **Route Overview**

*(approx. 2.5 km, 2‚Äì3 hours)*

**Nijiaqiao Exit E ‚û°Ô∏è Yulin Market ‚û°Ô∏è Fanghua Street ‚û°Ô∏è Local Tea Shop**

Start from **Nijiaqiao Station Exit E**, and follow the flow of locals into **Yulin Market**, where Chengdu‚Äôs daily rhythm unfolds in its most authentic form. People chat over vegetables, play cards in the shade, and snack between errands ‚Äî a perfect glimpse into everyday Chengdu life. Here, you can try some of the **local street favorites**: the famous **sweet-skinned duck** with its glossy caramelized skin, warm **corn pancakes** straight off the griddle, and a cup of refreshing **fermented rice drink (laozhaoshui)** that‚Äôs lightly sweet and fragrant. Every bite here feels casual, flavorful, and unmistakably Chengdu.

Continue along **Fanghua Street**, a charming lane filled with dessert caf√©s, vintage shops, and cozy Polaroid studios. The mix of coffee aroma, laughter, and soft afternoon light makes this part of the walk feel effortlessly pleasant.

Our final stop is a **local tea shop** that has been part of the neighborhood for over 20 years. Unlike the teahouses near People‚Äôs Park, where people go mainly to chat, here it‚Äôs all about **the art of tea itself**. The tea master will prepare several types of **top-quality teas** right before us ‚Äî from **Jasmine and Oolong to Pu‚Äôer and beyond** ‚Äî while sharing the stories, aromas, and traditions behind each brew. Some of these teas sell for more than **3000 RMB per 500g**, making this a rare chance to taste some of Chengdu‚Äôs finest flavors.

If you‚Äôd like, this is also a great place to pick up a **souvenir gift** for friends back home. The shop offers a wide range of teas with **flexible prices**, and the master will help you find something that suits your **personal taste and budget**. As the master always says, *there‚Äôs no absolute ‚Äúbetter‚Äù or ‚Äúworse‚Äù tea ‚Äî only what fits your own preference.*

They were college students, lacrosse players in high school, academically excellent in both college and high school, and great friends both. They cared for everyone, and made sure they were always there for others. They were busy, but planned everything well. They were never sad either. They made everyone smile. They were incredible and sweet people.

They died three hours later, after leaving for the trip, and no one knows why.

Signs point to a group of people in the woods, calling themselves ‚ÄúThe Fearful.‚Äù It was a cult that accepted Satan into their hearts, rather than God, as per information gathered from their interviews. They were always a concern. Problem is while they fit well, they had alibis. No one understands now what to do.

‚ÄúCould be a bear?‚Äù I asked.

My partner just kept looking straight at the murder site. They had setup camp it seemed.

It wasn‚Äôt pretty.

‚ÄúPolar bears attack people. Grizzlies and black bears run away.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù said Lewis. I had been with him for ten years. We never promoted ourselves. We prided ourselves on the fact that we didn‚Äôt climb.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not the cult. It might be each other,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúReally?‚Äù That didn‚Äôt make sense to me. ‚ÄúTerry and Jack don‚Äôt seem stupid Lewis. Besides how can both of them be so ripped apart?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey did it at the same time?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat are you on about?‚Äù

‚ÄúI am just entertaining ideas here. Could be a witch at this point.‚Äù

""It‚Äôs not a witch.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know.‚Äù

It was afternoon. Decided to go to a local diner.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ Now a days it's just too common seeing such promising young men and women throw their lives away you know. I don‚Äôt wanna blame the way the world is going-‚Äú

‚ÄúBut you do want to-‚Äú

‚ÄúI do Sam. I really do, and you know why? Because I am getting tired of hearing it in the news. It‚Äôs everywhere. And now it‚Äôs here.‚Äù

‚ÄúYour favorite movie is ‚ÄòNo Country for Old Men.‚Äô‚Äù

‚ÄúI like it for the action, I don‚Äôt care about the themes.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell the theme is things have always been bad, and they always find ways to be uniquely bad, and as we grow older, we can‚Äôt keep up.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay then, but does that address these two boys?‚Äù

I kept quiet for a bit. Lewis spoke again.

‚ÄúExactly. These young men had everything going forwards in their lives. Eventually we will figure out what we always do. Drug addicts on meth and psychedelics or some other crap robbed and killed them thinking that they are demons or something. Except I don‚Äôt ever know if they are making that last crap up for a psych eval. Better to bring religion than to admit they are monsters and finally dumb enough to act and also dumb enough to talk.‚Äù

Lewis starred at his coffee.

‚ÄúWhat do you want bud?‚Äù

‚ÄúI just wanna stop it before it happens instead of catch up. And I want it from all sides. I am not naive Sam, I am not. But society isn‚Äôt a tornado. It‚Äôs us. It is our little mistakes always adding up greater than their sum faster than we thought, because life is just slow enough to make us think where we are is where we will stay now.‚Äù

Lewis closed his eyes.
