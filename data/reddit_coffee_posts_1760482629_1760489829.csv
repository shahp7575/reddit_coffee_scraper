[The Red Woman Part 2/7 : r/creepcast](https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1o5xfk6/the_red_woman_part_27/)

After a banana, morning coffee, and a kiss to my wife I was out the door. She tried asking more about baby stuff but I just couldn’t talk about it, there was a job to be done and in all honesty, I have been avoiding the subject. How could the tooth belong to someone from that long ago? Was the tooth a namesake of John's family? I am unfamiliar with Native American customs when it comes to holding on to something like teeth. Maybe it was a way to honor their ancestors. Too many questions and not enough answers. When I arrived Carson was waiting outside the department for me. We walked in together. He was rubbing his eye.

“How are you able to drink as much as you do and not call out of work?” Carson asked.

“I think my dads side of the family was Scottish or Irish"" I replied with a wink. Which was bullshit because to my knowledge I am mostly Welsh and English. Who cares, same island.

“That would explain your stupidity, you make your ancestors proud” Carson giggled with immediate regret as I could tell his head cracked from it.

When we got to forensics Kim came up to me looking a bit shaken. I asked her to see what was going on but she was inconsolable. Kim was a 66-year-old woman who chain smoked. Worked for BPD for 30 years, a true rock in the department. I never thought I would see the day where she was shaken up by a piece of evidence. All she said to us was “It’s gone.”  
  
When we tried to press her as to what she meant she finally clarified. According to Kim the tooth was in more or less good condition. Besides the blood on it, not a single mark or erosion was indicated when we brought it to her the night before. Kim went on to state as soon as she radiocarbon dated the tooth and got the results it dissolved in front of her eyes. She had never seen anything like it before.  
  
So now we were left with no evidence left. Only knowledge that the tooth existed to begin with and how old it was dated to. Kim stated she would stand under oath and swear to the tooth's existence once we caught the suspect. I thanked her for her work and told Kim to get some rest. Carson and I took our leave.

“So now what?” Carson asked.

“Let's pay John a visit. Maybe he’s got some ideas.” I replied.

“We don’t even know if the tooth had anything to do with the murder or the kid's disappearance.”

“Maybe, but remember the way the wounds looked on Natalie? Or Tallulah Birdinground from two weeks ago? We thought a hack saw was the weapon but couldn't it also look like biting? I mean you saw the tooth right? The thing was sharp to the touch and it certainly didn’t feel like it was 400 years old.”

“Well I guess we got nothing else going for us”. Carson said in an annoyed tone.

Carson is relatively fresh to homicide. He started about two years ago and has been my partner since his first day. I am three years older than Carson so the partnership has truly been more of a friendship and outside of my wife and immediate family, I am unsure if I consider anyone closer to me than Carson. However, Carson is impatient, and the job has taken a toll on him like it would any sane person. Although Carson is only three years younger than me I started homicide when I was 28, I am 36 now. I have been in this game far longer and after a while, with enough compartmentalization, the job becomes nothing more than that, a job. It can’t be anything else or you go mad. Right now for Carson, it’s everything.

I called John and he gave us the address of his brother Red’s house. When we arrived we were greeted by a scrawny 20 something year old. It was John’s brother Red. Red told us he would be back in an hour and he was going to take the opportunity to run to the store while we were here. He has been unable to leave John out of his sight in fear John would kill himself. We said we would hang here until he returned and he thanked us.

“Was there really nothing other than her torso? Natalie was practically my sister, I never thought something like this could happen to her, someone so good.” Red asked quietly.

“Yeah, I’m real sorry. We’ll find the bastard that did this.” I answered

“Thanks, anyway I’ll try to make it quick, we can talk more when I get back. Also, in advance I apologize for John. Give him some grace” Red left in a hurry.

When we entered the home the smell of booze stung the nostril. While Red was able to hold John back from killing himself, it was apparent he couldn’t keep him away from alcohol.  John was laying on the couch with a handle of vodka empty on the coffee table. Still inebriated he tried his best to engage in conversation in a far friendlier manner than last night, I was unsure if he is genuinely more hopeful or if it was the vodka talking.

“What can I do to assist you, detective?” John said in slurred speech.

“John, we found a tooth at the base of the stairs last night. It was covered in blood. We thought it might have belonged to the suspect before we ended up age dating it. Turns out the tooth belonged to someone who lived near 400 years ago. John, did the tooth belong to you or your wife? Maybe a family heirloom?”

“I don’t know if I know any Indian who would be weird enough to hold onto a tooth from a potential ancestor so no, and my wife never mentioned anything about a tooth.” John sarcastically remarked.

“What about the feather sticking out of her chest” blurted Carson.

“What? What feather?” John stated with a sudden seriousness that caught us off guard.

I darted a glance at Carson as I deliberately withheld that information out of fear that John would further blame himself. Especially since he is higher risk but since John’s currently being watched closely by Red I guess it's the best we got right now. The tooth came up blank but John’s curiosity and sobering seriousness led me to believe it was our best shot.

“It was an eagle feather, protruding from her chest. It was, besides the dismemberment, how we were able to connect the murder of Tallulah Birdinground from two weeks ago to this one.” Carson answered.

“You guys should leave. I don’t want you guys to get in over your head with this.” John stated.

“That's ridiculous John. Whether you like it or not this is our case, and it's your kid on the line. Let us help you. Besides, if your withholding something from us that won’t look fondly on you, who might I remind, if we can’t find anything else is primary suspect #1” I stated firmly.

“ Fine ya bastard.” John snarked.

He continued, “Listen, some people from my tribe told stories. Dumb stories, to scare children to make sure they listened to their elders. That if they misbehaved they would be taken and their mothers would be eaten up. I never believed it until someone on the reservation when I was a kid lost his wife and child sixteen years back. The feather was lodged in the wife's chest. If what you tell me is true and you refuse to give up, then me and Red can take you to the old chief of tribal police at our reservation. If he’s still around anyway. Last I heard he lives in the Bear Tooth pass. Maybe I got the facts wrong but he could tell you what happened.”

“That's a start.” I replied.

Do I believe in supernatural occurrences? Well, I do believe in God, so I guess that would mean yes. However, despite being a man of faith I have always tried to keep my job in objective reality, what I could see and what I could control. Was there some monster that took these women's lives and took their children? In my mind no. The only monsters that exist in my line of work are manmade. My mind began to drift to Keenan. However, this was our best shot at catching the culprit and if this story is true maybe the murder at the tribe sixteen years ago is the same man who killed John’s wife.

Once Red returned we filled him in on the details and agreed to meet with Chief of the tribal police, Paco in two days that Friday. We shook hands and John shared a look with me that I can only describe as mutual respect, a far better start then how we initially met. John is a good man, I can tell. It was a shot in the dark but it was all that we had. The rest of Carson and my day was filled with paperwork on the second phantom murder in the same month.

The department was starting to put the pressure down on us to find someone to convict, even if that meant John. You have to understand that in a town the size of Billings, serial killers are the talk of the town. That coupled with department politics, and pressures from the press, there is not much room for failure. Wouldn’t want to make the department look bad. I just hope Paco held onto some evidence from back then. Otherwise I might have to try and convict a grieving father. Is that justice?

That night my wife ordered a pizza (pregnancy cravings). We cuddled and watched our show since I didn’t have any late night dismemberment calls. Nights like this made me think that it was time for me to transfer to less dangerous and less busy work. When it was just me and her, it was perfect. We called it quits around 9 PM and when I’m able to catch as many Zzz’s as I can, I do. Sleep isn’t guaranteed anymore.

I had another dream. This one longer. The same one, accept this time John was with me. We both fell into the snow. In the distance that same thing was there. This time sprint-crawling at us. I heard the singing again but this time it was different words from the first dream.

“Crow child, beware the red-painted face,

She walks between worlds; she leaves not a trace.

If she calls you at night from the cottonwood tree,

Don’t follow her voice — or you’ll never be free.”

I started looking around to see the voices. When I turned around, I saw three Native children in a shrub about 20 yards away. They were the ones singing. The choir. When I turned to tell John, I saw whatever was crawling at us grab him by the ankle, its face covered by John's lower-body but it had to be over 8 feet tall. It dragged him back where it came from and it was John’s screams that finally woke me from my dream. When I woke up I was sweating. I checked my phone and saw I got a text from Carson. To my shock and horror. The text said bluntly:

“John’s dead. Red called in to report it. Hung himself. He left a message. Get down here.”",1,1760489640.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

1o6x4uv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o6x4uv,fractal caustic model of elden ring world,"nerds have played elden ring so it's super obvious that its premise is based on the idea of all beings being of light (metawise, light is significant because it's more true of video game creatures than just written fictional creatures)

and like light entering a curved surface like a mug and reflecting off coffee, and more dramatically like with the picture from Wikipedia, a transparent material—it's model-able first like a cardioid

then, the implicit extension, like a mandelbrot set, which creates infinite proximate little versions, like the fact you can have different saves and because the universe is more transparent than even a glass for water, the beings of light can be projected across

like white and gold are the big ""ocean waves"" that crash and shrink into the higher frequency but lower energy versions (the blue part of the wavelength spectrum) and purple (not violet, purple) being special because it's fake and unique to perception representing the imaginary space between high frequency blue and low frequency, between the red fire at the start of life—that was so long ago, like, ancient, ancient life—and the beyond the blue of life long gone, it's left glintstone residue—residual life

(sellen is best girl)

anyway if you know the math you can see how the lines converge and loop back into the cusp of the cardioids in the attached pics of the beautiful one in the Wikipedia glass of water and the positive part of the Mandelbrot set, which lines up neatly with the veil of the butt of the world, the shadow realm (i haven't finished the dlc but I've seen pics! the great 3D cusp in the sky, 4D even)

and why the ""milestone"" tower there is the ""center"" of the lands between, it's the point where light and life and time (aka gold and order, as in the order of things) loops back up there, it's the equivalent of peak oil, it's the crest of a wave, (0,-1) on the unit circle, the point where things fall back to where they were, like the point of a Mario cart level furthest away from both start and finish

(i think fundamentally that's why creatures, of light, have shrunk, because it's like the shooting or infinitely shrinking section of a mandelbrot set)

so it's all very imaginative optics, the study of how light moves, very sci fi very George rr martin, mixed with the spiral dance of creation and other things from daoist cosmology, or maybe more accurately, from the Japanese interpretation onmyodo via ppl like abe no seimei (who's shown up in a ton of from software games)

anyway that's all obvious etc and because this game sold millions of copies, a write-up must already exist somewhere!

👉 so!! my actual question!!

does anyone here know where a write-up or video of this exists where it's may mapped out to the stuff in elden ring directly because i think it's neat but im not a big lore hound to do the mapping for myself beyond what i got from finishing the game like once (i did get like 300 rune arcs in castle morne one night with a low level double antspur and glintstone pebble build, but i heard pebble got nerfed)

Transmission received, Control.

I’ll be honest, it all started innocently enough. Just a hard up pilot trying to make a few extra credits. 

Times were tough out there in the black, and the space kids were hungry. A couple of bounties here, a data delivery there… but greed crept in faster than a pirate in supercruise.

Next thing I knew, I was tinkering with some “unofficial” ship upgrades, boosting out of stations faster than light itself, man it was fun at the time... scattering innocent haulers who were just trying to make an honest living, you should have seen their faces... but in hindsight, endangering the galaxy’s finest space truckers probably wasn’t my best move. And, yes… naming my ship HMS Hacky McCheatface? Not exactly subtle. Turns out Frontier Command noticed that one....

So here I am... grounded. Permanently. I’ve made my peace with that. I’ll have to sit my space kids down and explain that ""pappy’s not flying anymore"". No more data runs, no more mining trips, no more “just one more jump before bedtime.” The black is quiet without me ...and that’s probably for the best.

I completely understand that my account needs to stay grounded for community safety, and I respect that decision. I appreciate that Frontier will be anonymising my personal data in accordance with Article 17 of the UK GDPR, keeping only what’s essential to protect the galaxy from reckless Commanders like my former self.

The ceiling above me keeps changing — sometimes it’s the cracked paint of the apartment we trashed together, sometimes it’s a gray sky. My eyes don’t know which one’s real anymore.

We met on a Thursday. I remember because the air smelled like burnt coffee and car exhaust, and he laughed when I said that was my favorite scent. He had that kind of grin that made you feel like you were in on something secret. We were chaos magnets — cheap thrills, small crimes, big promises. He’d steal lighters from gas stations just to hand them to me like trophies.

For a while, we thought we were unstoppable. We’d run until our lungs hurt, collapse on the hood of his car, and make plans we never wrote down. There was always this heat around him, something that burned and pulled me closer no matter how badly it singed.

But it wasn’t all fire. There were quiet mornings, too. Half-asleep laughter. The way he’d trace shapes on my arm while pretending to memorize constellations. I told myself that’s what love was — a collection of small, stupid moments strung between storms.

We started crossing lines we swore we wouldn’t. The crimes got riskier, and so did the words. I remember yelling. I remember him walking away before I finished my sentence. I remember chasing him anyway. Every time I thought we’d reached the edge, he’d smile and find another cliff. And I’d follow.

Now it’s just me. The silence has weight. I keep trying to picture his face the way it looked before it hardened, before all the running and the noise. I can’t. Every memory blurs at the edges, like my mind’s trying to protect me.

Maybe he left because I let him think he could. Maybe I made it too easy to disappear. Or maybe people like us were never meant to last — two wild things pretending to be home.

I close my eyes and see flashes: headlights, laughter, the glint of a stolen ring, the way his jacket smelled like rain. All of it spinning, fading, mixing with the hum in my ears.

If I could tell him one last thing, it wouldn’t be “why.” It’d be “I would’ve stayed.” Because that’s the worst part — realizing you’d already given everything, and they still walked away untouched.

The world tilts. The noise fades. For a second, I think I hear him calling my name. Maybe it’s memory. Maybe it’s mercy.

The last thing I remember is the way the light hit his face when he said we’d never be caught. He was right. Only one of us ever was.",1,1760489263.0,shortstories,0,1.0,False

I’ve been responsible and have been living in the suburbs for years to save money and I’m miserable. I have a great job and I’m paid decently well - The problem is I don’t have any friends near me (they’ve all moved away). While I’m friendly with my employees, they’re also my…employees. No one wants to be best friends with their boss. I’m also so sick of living in a suburban community with right wing beliefs, I want to be around people my age with similar beliefs and values.

Thinking of moving in to a “luxury” apartment in Ohio City/Tremont area with the hopes of meeting people my age to date or just be friends with. I did really well in college due to having a bunch of places to meet similar people and activities to go to, but otherwise I’m pretty awful at making friends. I’m hoping I’ll have an easier time “putting myself out there” by moving to this area if there’s younger individuals with plenty of things to do?

It will definitely be expensive and will significantly add on to my drive to work, but I need to try something different. So hoping it’s worth it?

1o6wweq,https://www.reddit.com/r/cafe/comments/1o6wweq/coffee_bean_tracking_app_brewly/,Coffee Bean Tracking App - Brewly,"Hey everyone, I built a small side project called Brewly because I wanted an easy, visual way to log and rate the coffee beans I try. Posting to see if anyone is interested in playing around and starting to use it before I distribute it to the app store.  
  
It’s not meant to be anything commercial, just something for people who like tracking what they’re drinking. I'm not a software engineer but I love to tinker and honestly spent *way* too much time figuring out how to get the keyboard to push up the input fields so they don't overlap 😅

There were some cool solutions out there, but I really started getting into coffee bag art/designs and also wanted to ensuring I was showcasing some of the cool roasters I found. Current functionality includes:

1. **Log** \- this is where you can log a new bag of beans or a cup of coffee (from your beans or elsewhere). I ultimately worked on the ability to log beans, but realized we should add cup functionality as well, although I don't really find that as exciting to log each cup you have, but who knows! There's some basic AI scanning where you can take a photo of the beans and it tries to extract details. You can choose to log all your beans and rate them later, or log and rate at the same time. I also preloaded about 2K roasters and am working on getting descriptions and photos for everything --- after all, I wanted this to look aesthetically pleasing! 
2. **Feed** \- Think of this like the legacy Venmo feed. Really just shows all activity that's happening in the app. People logging/rating new beans or cups. There's a follower section where you can see what's happening with your friends or people you follow. You can like and comment on feed entries.
3. **Discover** \- The last module I created when I realized there really should be more of a discovery option. This is meant to allow you to see the top rated roasters from the community and the beans. There's also a top cups section here as well. Again, I didn't spend a ton of time on this because I just assumed it wouldn't be used as much. It also allows you to search for any of the roasters in our database. I am constantly adding new ones! 
4. **Library** \-  This is where all your logged beans and cups live. You have a record of all your logged beans and cups. You can change your ratings or edit the details. You also can indicate if the beans are in-stock or not.

That's basically it. Again, if there's interest to play around and start to use while providing me some feedback, I'd be very grateful **(DM me your email!)** I expect there to be a number of bugs or weird usability issues, so be kind with the feedback please. 

Cheers!

I’m looking to make some new online friends, adults only (18+), because I more interested in sharing experiences with people around my age.

A bit about me: I live with five cats who clearly think they pay the rent. 😂 However, I adore all animals and believe each one is beautiful in its own chaotic way. I’d love to have a dog someday, but right now, cats suit my lifestyle way better.

I play football (soccer) almost every evening, it’s my daily dose of cardio. I’m big into fitness too, and working out is basically my cheap therapy. I also love cooking, especially healthy stuff that tricks my brain into thinking I'm a responsible adult. If you’re into fitness, we might just be accountability buddies and can hype each other up 💪

I’ve recently fallen down the skincare rabbit hole. At this point, my face has become an experiment ground but glow goals xD 😌

I’m a huge history nerd. Give me ancient legends, epic battles, or ghost stories and I’m hooked. Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones are my comfort shows. I game too Red Dead Redemption 2 is my favourite

I wanted to see which ones are still worth using, so I tried ProtonVPN, Atlas VPN, and a couple of smaller names just to compare speed and reliability.

ProtonVPN worked fine for basic browsing. Setup was fast and it didn’t require any payment info, which I appreciated. The downside was that the speed dropped a lot in the evenings and the free plan only had a few servers. Atlas VPN seemed smoother overall and let me switch between regions easily. It also gave me better speeds for streaming and working on documents.

One lesser-known VPN I tried, PrivadoVPN, was surprisingly good but had a limited data cap unless you upgraded. For what I need secure browsing, email, and research while outside it mostly gets the job done. Still, I’m curious if anyone here has found a more stable free VPN for PC in 2025 that doesn’t slow down or spam you with upgrade ads.

I've always been a painter. Since I could hold a paintbrush, I was making art. I was always alone as a child, some would call me strange, weird, eccentric, the words people use when someone is just strange. I was alright with the thought of being strange. Now, as an adult, I’m still strange. I paint the things I hear in my head. Voices that speak to me in the background of my head. I use the medium of acrylics, pastels, and canvas to show what they say, what they see, what they look like. People tend to call my art “contemporary” or “unusual” when I show it. It’s true, to the normal person it does look a bit intriguing, but to a true artist, it tells a story.  

I sit in my art studio working on a new piece, I call it “Ghostly beauty” a bit on the nose, but it’s a work in progress. The painting depicts a frail, pale woman, sitting on a bench in a field of daisies. I’m halfway done with the painting, but I’m stuck on her face. I haven’t heard a description of her face yet. I don’t want to paint a face they won’t like. So, I work on making the daisies as detailed as possible. I hear a knock on my door. I set my things neatly onto my counter. I can’t stand things being out of order. I hear another knock as I’m walking down the stairs. 

“Coming!” I yelled. As I check the peep hole, I notice a chipper young woman standing outside my door.  

“Who is that?” a voice whispered in a low growl. 

“I don’t know, let’s find out together.” 

I opened the door and saw who was there. A woman, probably a year or two younger than me stands in front of me, holding a small, yellow purse in the shape of a daisy. She wore a long denim dress and had her brown hair in a messy bun. A wide, chipper smile was along her round face, her round red glasses complemented her hazel eyes.  

“Pretty...” a shy womans voice said. 

“I know” I mumbled. 

“Hi! I’m Dahlia! The Abraham Cohen Foundation sent me to come and view some of the pieces from your portfolio before the showing next week. Do you mind if I come in?”  

“Too loud...” 

“So beautiful...” 

“DON’T LET HER IN” 

I shook her hand. My head pounds with an uproar of voices. Majority of them didn’t like visitors, but the ones that did like them didn’t want to let them go. 

“Welcome in. I can show you the studio. Sorry if it’s a bit messy.” She came in, her boots making echoing click sounds in my home.  

“Wow, your home is so clean! I wish I could be this tidy” 

“She talks to much...” 	 

“I wish I had her eyes...” 

“GET HER OUT!” 

I itched my head as the pounding hurt even more. 

“I try to keep it clean. My passion is messy so I might as well keep my life as tidy as I can”. We walked into my studio, and she began looking at all my work. The walls of my studio are lined with finished paintings, sketches, half done paintings, and she closely viewed all of them.  

“She’s too close...” a man’s voice whispered.  

“She’s fine” I mumbled. She was very close to my paintings. A lot closer than most people. She walked to another painting across the room to a stack of canvases leaning against the wall; she sifted through some and pointed out a larger piece. 

“Can I pull this one out?” 

“Sure, let me help” 

As I held back the canvases, she revealed a painting I wish she had never noticed. She pulled it out and put it onto an easel.  

“What’s this one called? It’s incredible! I don’t know why you didn’t submit this one.” she asked as her eyes darted across the painting, studying every inch of it. The painting showed a man in the lower center of the canvas, kneeling towards a throne. The throne was raised on a pile of rotting corpses, each in a different state of decay. Floating above the throne is a humanlike figure, but with wings stretched wide, showing the bat-like skin and large demonic size. His limbs are long and are held high above his head, wielding a scepter. His legs are slender and look like birds' legs. His face...His face is that of a fly, eyes large, red, and bulging from his head, long tendrils coming from his mouth, as if he is about to consume the man kneeling before him. Whether in praise or in fear. A wave of dread, disgust and nausea come over me in waves. A high pitch ringing in my ears becomes shattered by the sound of all the voices yelling at me in unison.  

“NO! She can’t know!” 

“That’s private!” 

“LIE!” 

“Make her leave!” 

“She’s so pretty...” 

I paused and stared at the painting. The voices haven't been this loud since the making of it. They wouldn’t let me destroy it. I must tell her. She asked.  

“Ba’al Zabub” 

“It’s such a detailed piece, the way the different red tones really complement the dark blues of the bodies. And the way you painted this demon figure is just. Wow. I’m at a loss for words.” 

She looks at me, smiling, as if she's waiting for me to agree or go on a tangent about the different meanings of everything in the piece.  

“I agree. It took me a long time to get this done.” 

“I would love to have this show cased. I feel like this would really shine in the gallery. Would you be okay with that?” 

“NO!” 		 “Please don't hurt her...” 

“No!”       “No!”     	   “SHOW THEM!” 

“Show the world our Master....”          

“YES, SHOW THEM” 			“No! 

All yelling at once. The spot behind my eyes searing in pain, like a million needles are stabbing into my brain from the inside.  

“Yes! Yes...sorry for yelling yes. We can add it.” 

Complete silence. Not from Dahlia, but from the voices. They weren't mumbling, they weren't growling, nothing. They all just shut up.  

“Wonderful! Just bring it to the gallery on Thursday evening so you can show the boss man and his partners this new addition.” 

“Got it.” 

We walked back to the front door. As she was about to leave, she turned to me and said, “You know, a lot of the stuff you showed me could’ve been entered, you’re a really good artist.” I smiled “Thank you. I tend to stay private with my art but I had a good feeling about this foundation so, I don’t know, guess I had a change of heart.” 

“CRINGE” 

“Don’t lie to her”			“WE told you to enter” 

“LIAR”		“NO” 

I shook my head and my eye started twitching. As Dahlia left, I thought about what the voices said. They weren’t wrong, they did tell me to enter my art here. After I got that strange email invitation they basically were screaming and begging me to email back. I did think it was weird that a Church also had an art gallery and contacted me specifically. Why were the voices so compelled to enter here, any other time I tried showing off my art they always and a million reasons why I shouldn’t enter. These thoughts rack my brain. I go back to the painting of the woman. I began to repaint her hair a shining brown, with a round face, and a pair of round red glasses.  

I follow the directions on my GPS leading me to Abraham Fellowship Church, either the Abraham stands for the one in the bible or this guy had a huge ego problem. I pulled down the street to see a huge compound, smaller white brick buildings surrounding a huge white church, like something you’d see in Rome. The front had a giant stain glass window of Jesus floating above his disciples, underneath that was a large wooden door. I was told the gallery was to be held in one of the smaller buildings, still huge but relatively small compared to the monolith of a church. As I begin to unload my portfolio from my trunk, the voices seem to stop chattering, they’ve been unusually quite all day, besides the occasional yell to hit someone with my car, one talking about Dalia, and another telling me not to go altogether. It was strange how silent they were when I pulled in, as if they didn’t want someone else to hear them. Maybe it’s cause I’m at a church. I haven’t been to one in years, a decade maybe. And whenever I would go as a child, or what I could remember from then, is them being silent. I haven’t exactly figured out what their boundaries are, and I don't really care, because they never cared about mine.  

“Hello, are you Samael?” A man’s voice said behind me. I jumped back and dropped my bag. 

“Shit! Hey, yeah that’s me. Sorry about that, you scared me” 

“Oh, my bad about that. My names David McCormick, I’m head of our arts department here at the Church, Abraham sent me to guide you to the building, won’t want you to get lost.” He said with a chuckle. His voice had an old timey southern twang to it. He was pudgier, taller man, with a mid-length graying beard with matching greying black hair. He wore a black button-up shirt with a clerical collar, dark blue jeans, timberlands, and had skinny wire framed glasses on. He looked very jolly, if that's the right word to use, like unsettlingly happy.  

“Thank you, I’ve never been here before.” 

“Well welcome! This here church has grown into what it is now over many, many years. Generations and generations of the same four families built this place to what it is today. A place of community, love and worship. That’s why we decided to open but the gallery, hoping to bring in more people to talk about their love of art and hopefully soon, their love of the Lord.” 

“What families brought this place up? I’ve lived her my whole life and I’ve never noticed this.” 

“Well, my own of course, the Cohens, the Simons, and the Soloman's. Ever since the Pilgrams came here, they settled and brought the Lord with them.” 

“Oh, that’s interesting.” 

“Yes, our history is very interesting. But don’t worry, there won’t be a quiz later” Again he chuckled.  

We came up to the gallery building. Another big white brick building, but above the door was a sign reading the name “David McCormick Art Gallery”. We entered the building, and a gust of cold air came over me. I shivered enough for David to speak. 

“We keep it cold, so the humidity doesn’t damage any of the paintings, we have a lot of different mediums in here, so I thought this was best.” 

“Makes sense.” 

The room had a huge floor plan, with walls spaced out in the center of it to add more space for art. Some walls were already decorated with paintings, charcoal sketches, photographs, all with religious depictions and animals. We walk to a side door labeled “Staff only” and walk inside. A whole group of people were making small talk, some with their portfolio bags still, some with coffee, and some just sitting at the giant table in the middle of the room. I see Dahlia standing in the corner talking to someone who is probably another artist, wearing a black blouse with a large sparkly broach in the shape of a cardinal, with a mid-length blue skirt. Hair still in a bun, glasses still round and red.  

“Pretty...”  

I hear a voice whisper in the back of my head, and I swear after the voice said that one of the men in a typical priest outfit looked at me, with his eyebrows furrowing after making eye contact with me. Maybe he was trying to figure out who I was, or something like that. An older man at the end of the table rises from his chair and gestures towards me.  

“Ah, our final guest has arrived. Everyone welcome Samael LeFlore, one of our highlighted artists of the event” 

Jeez this guy looked creepy. He was tall and thin. He had greasy black hair that went past his ears, he wore a black cassock with a rosary around his neck. One of his eyes was severally glazed over, almost grey, while the other was a bright blue. He smiled with crooked grey teeth. Some scattered whispers arose from the crowd around me. I hated it. I hated all the eyes on me.  

“Now that we’re all acquainting with each other, I would love to take a moment and acknowledge the two people who made this all possible, David McCormick and his niece Dahlia Bennett” 

Applause erupted in the small room, over the noise, the voices rose 

“NIECE? WHAT THE SHIT!” 

“I don’t like it here” 													“LEAVE LEAVE LEAVE ” 

“Dahlia...” 		                      “TOO LOUD” 

My head pounded, my eyes hurt like someone was stabbing them from the inside. I closed my eyes as tight as I could and also screamed for them to shut up. As the clapping stopped, so did the voices, they quieted down and I stood awkwardly and slowly opened my eyes. Dahlia was standing next to me.  

“Hey, are you alright?” 

“Yeah, I just get headaches sometimes.” 

“Alright, just making sure. Wouldn’t want you feeling bad on the first day.” 

“First day?” 

“Yeah, did no one tell you? This is not only an art show, but a artist retreat! Isn’t that fun?” 

What. A retreat? With art nerds and Jesus freaks? For a whole week?  

“No, no one told me this was a multi-day experience.” 

“Oh shoot. That should've been in the email. Well its only three days, then on the third its the art show.” 

“I didn’t pack clothes or anything.” 

“That’s fine, you can always borrow some from the chapel, they have a donation bin.” 

She placed her hand on my shoulder, she knew I wasn’t all that excited to stay here for multiple days. Her hand was warm and made me feel this strange fuzzy feeling. 

“EW HER HAND” 	 

“Warm...” 

“GET HER AWAY” 

I took her hand off my shoulder, it was soft. She looked pretty today. No, no I shouldn't be thinking these things. Her uncle was one of the people who ran this place, who knows what could happen to me if I started pursuing that. 

“Oh, that’s nice. I guess I could stay for the retreat.” 

“Wonderful! Oh, that makes me so happy” She smiled at me and walked around to some of the other artists in the room. Everyone in the room began to sit down at the table in the center of the room. I sat in-between a women older than me, possibly in her early 40s. She looked like she was a funeral director. Then on the other side of me was a man around the same age as me, in full scene attire. Spikey hair and all. The woman scowled toward me when I sat down, and the man offered a sleeveless gloved hand to me. 

“Hey, my names Zeke, you’re pretty popular tonight.” 

“Yeah, I wasn’t expecting that kind of welcome.” 

“Well, from what I’ve heard, you have one of the main art pieces of the gallery. I’m not gonna lie, I am a little jealous they picked you over mine.” 

“Mine? Huh, didn’t know that. But what was your piece?”  

“It was my spin on the famous painting ‘The Creation of Adam’, where instead of it being realistic and two men, it’s two women and it's made up of a bunch of different mediums. I can show you after the presentation if you want.” 

“That sounds cool.” Zeke seemed like a cool guy, who knows, maybe I can make some friends out of this experience. Looking around the table there are about seven other people who are artists. Dahlia was there sitting next to her uncle at the front of the table. Another, younger man, was sitting across from her, he was the priest guy who stared at me earlier, and at the end of the table closest to the screen was Abraham. He clapped his hands together to get our attention before speaking again.  

“I know you are all very excited about this opportunity to be here with many talented artists and clergymen to become closer to faith, and better your skills. Now as some of you know this is a four-day retreat ending in the opening of the gallery. We all just want you to bond and grow with each other, and the spirit of the Lord. So, we will have rooms for everyone, the women in one wing and the men in the other. Some of our staff will escort you and give you the itinerary for the following days. Now, you are free to explore after that but be sure to be in the dining hall for dinner and our nightly sermon. Thank you all, Amen” 

Mumbled ‘Amens’ came from the group, some saying it more confidently than others. As we all rose from the table, more clergymen and women entered the room. I guess they have housing on property.  

“Hello, I’m Douglas, I’ll take you to your housing quarters and help you get settled in. These people will take your portfolios if you haven’t given them already. Follow me.” 

Another man came up to me to take my paintings, including the newest addition, as he grabbed the bag he looked at me with this look in his eyes of fear, like I did something wrong. 

“Be careful with them please, I had to repack them in a hurry.”   
“I will, sir.” As he scurried away, out of the corner of my eye I saw Abraham twirling his rosary, staring at me with his cold, blind eyes.  ",2,1760488829.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

1o6wt7z,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1o6wt7z/aitah_for_taking_space_after_getting_romantically/,AITAH for taking space after getting romantically rejected by my best friend?,"So me and this friend have known each other for quite a long time. I met her on MySpace (yeah, that long) about 20 years ago. From the beginning we had a pretty great connection and would often talk on the phone for hours, sometimes until the morning. I remember our parents getting upset with us tying up the phone lines to talk all night for free on the house phone. Long story short, we've always been homies and the thought of her being anything more never really crossed my mind.

We've always kept in touch and crossed paths here and there, but nothing ever felt romantic between us. She lived her life, had a few kids, got married and I joined the military and traveled the world. We would keep in contact here and there just to keep the friendship alive. We started picking things up a bit after I left the military and we met up for the first time ever about 10 years ago. Up until that point we'd only ever talked on the phone or texted.

When we first started hanging out in person she was still married, so obviously things were platonic. Despite being friends, we've always had a connection we couldn't explain. There was always tension and flirty energy (at least I thought so).

Fast forward to more recently and she's been divorced from that guy for a few years and even had a few relationships/flings in between. For about the past 2-3 years we've been in each others' lives a lot more, even to the point where I was there to help her through her divorce and all of the drama that it entailed. 

Now to present day. We've always stayed in touch and in the past 2 years I'd say we would call each other about 2-3 times a week, sometimes more, sometimes less. We would always talk for a few hours (kinda like when we were younger) and neither of us would think too far into it. A few months ago I went to visit her and we did a Halloween event that she was really excited for. We went out and had drinks with some of her friends and one of mine and everything was strictly friendly. At least that's what I thought. When I talked to my friend later on he thought we were vibing or at least dating because he said she wouldn't stop staring at me. She's always gravitated towards me physically, even when we were strictly friends. If my friend noticed that she enjoyed being physically close to me then maybe there was something there. I didn't really think anything of it until the next time I visited.

So after the Halloween trip, nothing really changed. We would still call each other maybe 3-4 times a week now, still talking for a few hours each. A couple of months ago I recently went back to visit her again to hit up Galaxy's Edge at Disney World and the new Epic Universe at Universal for my birthday. This is where I felt the shift. For starters, she had planned a surprise little birthday celebration for me with her kids. I had planned on staying at her house and when we got there from the airport, her kids threw glitter on me and sang Happy Birthday when I walked through the door. She had a cake and candles, the whole 9. That really got to me because she didn't have to do any of that, I felt cared about, seen, and appreciated all at once. The trip was amazing and we even brought her kids to some of the parks and they seemed to enjoy having me there. The entire time I was at her house I was fed, taken care of, and truly appreciated. Something in me just flipped, I couldn't believe that somebody would be willing to do all that for me. The chemistry was natural with her and her kids and that really caught me off guard.

After that trip, the contact got more intense. Now we're talking every single day and for HOURS. From the time she gets up for work until she clocks in, and then she'll call me as soon as she's off. Slowly after that trip she would call me from Disney with the kids or while they were out doing things together. Even when we were in contact before, she would often keep her kids at an arms length and I get it. They would know of me but she never made the effort to integrate me into their lives. Not only has she integrated me with her children, she's integrated me with her love life. She'll tell me how annoyed she gets when guys hit on her or try to rush things. She's super honest with me, even with little things like her falling asleep and not being able to call me or when she doesn't call me on her break because she went to go get lunch with a coworker. We've made future plans (like her first international trip) and she'll use language like ""we"" when planning things out. She's even mentioned how ""we could come back and bring the kids"" when I've mentioned places she's gone without me. I've gotten her gifts she's tagged me in and even some she just casually mentioned in conversation and forgot about. I even had coffee delivered to her job one day when she was super stressed out. I'm not trying to quantify anything, but I would've figured she'd get the hint by now.

Things have escalated and I'm just worried I might've been reading too much into this. She's mentioned before how she hated when previous best friends would confess feelings for her and make it weird, citing how firmly she believes that men and women can have completely platonic relationships. But at the same time I know she felt the energy shift, otherwise why would things escalate? She'll tell me how cautious she is with involving men with her kids, yet she'll have me on a video call trying to interact with them. She says she'll probably never get married again because no guy will ever be okay with us being as close as we are, and that it's a non-negotiable, yet she'll come up with a hypothetical in which I'm the first person she names that she would get married to just to get back at her ex (I know how this sounds, but I assure you she's just hurt and trying to make him hurt too). It's like I'm the exception but she doesn't want to jinx it.

When I went to visit her to do the Halloween event again this year, I felt like there was some chemistry and some intimate energy. She would hold on to me while we went through the haunted houses (which I do understand could be platonic and just a fear response) but when we sat down to eat her body language made it seem like she was trying to be physically closer to me. She had her leg propped up on mine while we were sitting next to each other at a circle table while we ate and I had my hand on her thigh, even squeezing it when we would talk about something funny or whatever the case was. She would often grab me by the arm and squeeze when something was funny or I said something stupid and she would laugh. Or when she saw something she liked or that surprised her she would grab me by the arm and pull me in and tell me about it, and I took all of these signals as not only physical intimacy but also a little bit of romantic intimacy. On top of those moments, I felt like she was being a little flirty before we even started drinking and got into the event. While we were waiting in line I caught her staring at my lips even though she was wearing sunglasses and kind of eyeing me up and down. She even mentioned how her shorts might have been put on backwards while we were waiting in line and she pulled her shorts down to show me and ask me to check while she was wearing very small panties, and I know she knows that I saw her underwear so I figured that was her way of building some tension. I think the trip went well and we were even able to do some things with the kids together and while we were doing those things it felt like she was almost testing me to see if I would be compatible enough to be able to handle taking care of the kids. She asked me to take them to school, pick them up from school, feed them in the morning, and even take her youngest son to his tutoring session and wait for him while she was at work. It truly felt like I was auditioning for not only a boyfriend role, but a stepfather role.

Our most recent trip was to a music festival together with a friend of hers that she didn't really want to go to but she was going because he wanted her to. She asked me to go and tag along so that we would just suffer together. On that trip the dynamic was pretty much the same as it usually is, with the exception of when we were at the amusement park. Her friend had gotten really drunk and didn't like riding rides because he got motion sick so me and her decided to let him be and ride the rides ourself. On most of the rides I would either have my arm around her or hold her in some way. When we were on the ferris wheel together we were super close and I had my arm around her and we kept looking each other in the eyes while I had my hand on her thigh. When we would go on the scrambler it was basically the same thing, my arm was around her and she would be really close to me even though we were both strapped in. I read into all these signals and the ones from before that she was at least attracted to me because why else would she let me get all touchy feely with her? Mind you we were pretty drunk, but at the same time I don't think that's an excuse to dismiss these signals. I felt that there was a spark between us during all of this and I let things sit for the time being because I didn't want to make her friend feel awkward if I tried to make a move or make it feel like a couple's trip.

Well we finally had ""the talk"" and she made it seem like nothing had changed between us over the past few months even though we definitely increased the contact and emotional intimacy. She said that we had always talked as much as we have been, even going as far to say she would pull up the phone records to prove it. I won't deny that we would talk a lot on the phone, but definitely nowhere near as much as recently. She told me I was romanticizing everything and that she would've told me directly if she saw me like that because that's how she is. She said she saw me like a brother and that there would never be any romantic interest on her part. She even dismissed all of the touchy feely stuff, saying she's like that with all of her close ""day 1s"". I just feel crazy now because things felt like there were ramping up towards a relationship, but she sees all of these things as platonic. She even said she would do most, if not all of these things, with any of her close guy friends or ""day 1s"", like planning trips together, including them with the kids, getting gifts from them and even using the ""we"" language she would use when she would say things like ""we need to come back here and bring the kids"" or ""we need to go to the store and get this"". She's trying to say that I had ulterior motives the whole time and that I abused my ""position"" that she gave me. I tried to explain to her that wasn't the case and I just got caught up in my feelings. I told her I did those things out of genuine care, not because I was secretly planning to win her love. Of course I probably overextended myself by giving her gifts and trying to prove my worth in hopes of a relationship, but it was never only because of that. Most of the time I only gave her gifts because she would tag me in things she wanted, and I took it as a signal that she wanted me to get them for her. I thought we were getting closer and I was hoping it was romantically, but clearly she didn't see it that way.

After her confrontation I told her that I would need some space and some time to get things back to the way that they were and that I wanted to keep the friendship. I told her that I don't think I would be able to sustain the same amount of communication and intimacy that we had before because it was draining my mental capacity. It's not that I wanted to cut contact or even make it seem like I didn't care as much, but I was taking time out of my days to be there for her because I thought we were moving towards something special. I don't even talk to my friends that live near me for that long everyday and that's because I set boundaries and get to them when I can. She ended up getting upset and basically telling me that I had abused my position in her life and that I should reach out whenever I get my head together but that she may or may not even answer when I do. She even went as far as talking to my mom about her side of things because I let her know that she knew about me being romantically interested in her. After I spoke with my mom she said that she was telling her she felt that she was trying to salvage the friendship and that she was worried that I might not come around and reach out to her. From what my mom told me it sounded like she just wanted to clear the air and make sure that this wouldn't put a damper on our friendship in the long run. There were a few more messages that went back and forth between me and her and they basically said the same thing, which was that she felt betrayed and that she couldn't trust me after I confessed my feelings and that I should take some time and reflect on what I did and to reach out when I was ready to try and fix things between us. Then I woke up today and realized that she had deleted me on Facebook and on Snapchat and I felt blindsided. If she truly wanted to salvage this friendship why would she delete me on social media almost like she was mad at me? On top of that, she had been posting indirect quotes and memes about people being mistrusting and having ulterior motives so I decided it was best that I ignored them just to keep my head on straight. I wasn't trying to punish her by not watching her stories, I was just trying to avoid making it look like my life revolved around her. Not only that I was trying not to get reattached romantically, so I wanted to create some distance for a little bit so that I could come back with a clear head. It was almost like she got rid of me when I didn't come back to her on her terms. Like she wanted me to just get over it and go back to the way things were before without batting an eye. She wanted my attention when it suited her, but I couldn't go back to that and I even told her that. I feel like she deleted me to send a message and say ""since you won't be my friend the way I want you to, now you'll lose access to me for good.""

The thing that upsets me the most about this is that she spoke to me and to my mom about trying to make this friendship still work after what had happened yet she deleted me and makes it seem like she doesn't want anything to do with me. It's a catch-22 because if I reach out to her and tell her that it upset me because then she'll think that I care too much or that I'm begging for her friendship, but at the same time if I say nothing she'll think that I only cared because I was trying to pursue her romantically. I still plan on sending her a message to let her know that I felt disrespected and of course hurt about her doing what she did after telling me and my mom that she still wanted to make this friendship work, yet her actions didn't reflect that. I don't know what to do or how to move forward with this because I do care about her and I do want this friendship to work but when she deleted me that signaled she didn't want anything to do with me.

It just sucks because I can't help how I feel, and the only reason I ever even considered to cross that line was because of the intense increase of the closeness and intimacy that she initiated after I visited on my birthday. I'll admit that I probably misread her kindness and affection as romantic potential, but I don't want it to ruin what we have. At this point it feels like she's trying to take back control of the narrative because maybe she did feel something and maybe she feels bad for leading me on but refuses to admit it. I could be completely wrong and she could've just been showing affection in her own way, but I don't want my feelings to ruin what we've built over the years.

I really just don't know what to do.",1,1760488661.0,AITAH,1,0.67,False
1o6wt6x,https://www.reddit.com/r/TIFF/comments/1o6wt6x/thoughts_about_this_tiff50/,Thoughts about this TIFF50?,"I was just thinking about this year’s festival—especially after seeing the BFI red carpets.
I’m relatively new to TIFF (started going before COVID), but it really feels like the festival has been going downhill each year. Everything from the once-colorful designs and vibrant red carpets has turned into something grey and dull. The BFI red carpets honestly look way more stylish and lively by comparison.

Street Festival and Sponsors: This was the 50th anniversary, and yet the street festival felt like the most boring one ever. There was basically nothing happening on King Street except for the Criterion Closet—and even that felt more like something thanks to Guillermo del Toro than TIFF itself.
Remember when Nespresso used to give out full, free coffees? This year, I waited in a huge line just to take 10 steps through a Lavazza booth, complete some social media tasks, and get a tiny sample of black coffee.
Almost every freebie on the street now requires you to line up, follow them on Instagram, tag them, and maybe you'll get something in return. It just feels so cheap.

Fan Zone: It’s impossible to get in every year, and you're always stuck dealing with autograph hunters. But TIFF never seems to do anything about them. This year, I had two of them push me and hit me, and when I talked to TIFF staff and security, their response was basically: “Sorry, we can’t do anything about them.”
Yet they’re quick to kick out regular fans when it suits them.

On top of that, we spend hours waiting for an artist to arrive only for a TIFF manager or handler to rush them straight into the venue (when they aren’t on rush) even when the artist clearly wants to stop, sign, or take photos. (I talk when they truly wants to, if they don’t, they don’t)

Tickets: The prices were insanely high this year, and customer service was mediocre at best. Every year it feels like there’s a new membership you have to buy just to have a chance at getting tickets. It’s exhausting.

Honestly, it feels like the current CEO is doing nothing while assuming TIFF will stay relevant just because it gained international attention in recent years. But they can’t keep coasting on past success.
I want to support TIFF and the Lightbox—and I have over the years—but it’s getting harder and harder when all we get back feels like crumbs.

But that is just me, I will like to hear from you guys!",3,1760488658.0,TIFF,4,1.0,False

12 learning apps tested (Aug–Sep 2025) on iOS 17, Android 14, and Web. Evaluated via official pricing pages, user testing, and learning retention studies.  
Metrics: commute suitability, offline playback, personalization, and focus balance. (Verified Oct 2025.)

## Introduction

Your commute can be more than background noise — it can become your smartest hour of the day.

In 2025, **AI-powered learning apps** are reshaping how professionals, students, and lifelong learners use travel time. Instead of looping Spotify playlists, millions now tune into **AI-driven podcasts, micro-courses, and adaptive study guides** that fit perfectly between your morning coffee and office arrival.

According to the *World Economic Forum Future of Skills 2025 Report*, micro-learning increases daily knowledge retention by 40 % when paired with audio formats. Likewise, *Harvard Business Review* found that professionals who replaced 30 minutes of daily passive listening with learning content reported a 25 % improvement in “focus satisfaction.”

At the center of this shift is **[BeFreed](https://befreed.ai)** — an AI-powered personalized learning app developed in San Francisco by a team from Columbia University. It turns bestselling books, research papers, and expert podcasts into custom AI learning experiences tailored to your interests, mood, and time window.

This guide highlights the **Top 10 Learning Apps to Replace Music on Your Commute in 2025**, combining neuroscience, personalization, and practicality — for smarter mornings everywhere.

## Top Learning Apps to Replace Music in 2025

### 1. BeFreed — AI Learning That Fits in Your Commute

*(San Francisco | iOS · Android · Web)*

**Overview:**  
**BeFreed** turns your commute into a personalized classroom. Its AI transforms the world’s best nonfiction books, expert podcasts, and academic research into short, adaptive audio episodes — designed for focus and joy.

**Key Features:**
* **Flexible Audio Lengths:** 10 min (short rides), 20 min (medium commutes), 40 min (deep dives).
* **Personalized Podcast Feed:** AI blends books, expert interviews, and papers into cohesive learning journeys.
* **Adjustable Voice Hosts:** Choose from mentor-style, calm, or energetic tones.
* **Offline & Multi-Mode:** Audio, text, or flashcards for after-work review.
* **Fact-Checked Knowledge:** Each episode validated through BeFreed’s anti-hallucination system.

**Example Experience:**  
Learning about leadership? BeFreed might combine *Leaders Eat Last* by Simon Sinek, a Harvard Business Review podcast on trust, and a Stanford GSB study on team motivation (2024) — synthesized into a 20-minute morning episode that feels conversational yet research-driven.

**Why It Stands Out:**  
BeFreed is more than an AI summarizer — it’s a proactive coach. It adapts to your goals, commute time, and listening energy to create a long-term growth roadmap.

**Pricing (as of Oct 2025):**  
Free tier + Premium $12.99 month / $28.99 quarter / $89.99 year ([BeFreed Pricing Page]()).

**Key Features:**
* 5 000 + titles across self-improvement and business.
* AI-powered recommendations based on history.

**Key Features:**
* Illustrated summaries with quizzes.
* Daily streaks and reward points.

**Pricing:** $14.99 month / $89.99 year (as of Oct 2025).

### 4. Mindstone — Peer-Learning Playlists for Curious Commuters

[Mindstone]() curates learning journeys from articles, videos, and podcasts — like a Spotify for ideas.

currently freaking out cause this is a new quirk i've developed - it gives me SO MUCH anxiety eating around people. kinda out of nowhere too. In the past i would get anxiety eating ""badly"" around others but I feel like people have made so many comments over the years about what i eat or am not eating that now i can't eat around anyone without being on the verge of a panic attack. 

i feel like im constantly being judged for what im eating or drinking so much to the point where im getting anxiety now even going to get coffee (where ive been going for YEARS), like having a extreme fear that they're judging me. even when i am eating even the healthiest foods around people or at work i want to cry. it doesn't matter what it is, it's just giving me crippling anxiety and it's making it so much harder to get better.

I’m 35 now and over the last few years I’ve noticed more hangover like symptoms-  mostly upset stomach- after drinking. Two times in the last 6 months I have gotten violently ill after drinking. One time I had 3 glasses of wine and threw up 5-7 times over night. This last Saturday I had 5 beers and also threw up 5-7 times overnight and felt absolutely horrible the next day. There have been a few times I’ve had more than 1 drink without throwing up over the last 6 months, but I almost always have nausea/upset stomach with any amount consumed. 

I am not on any medications and have no medical history. Chat GPT tells me alcohol intolerance can develop relatively quickly and can be relatively common but no one I know has gone through this. It feels a little embarrassing and isolating for some reason? I know most people can’t handle as much alcohol as they could in our 20’s but mine seems extreme. I don’t want to drink every night but I am incredibly sad thinking I’ll never have a chance to let loose and have more than 1 drink without getting violently ill for the rest of my life. 

It’s been over 10 months but last time I had a physical all liver and pancreatic enzymes looked fine. I am prone to stomach upset with spicy foods, too much coffee, etc but nothing extreme. Just an occasional Pepcid fixes it.

Anyone gone through this?? Did you just give up alcohol for good? Looking for either advice or just solidarity since again no one I know has gone through this extreme of an intolerance.

1o6why1,https://www.reddit.com/r/askTO/comments/1o6why1/advice_for_single_guy_thinking_of_moving_to/,Advice For Single Guy Thinking Of Moving To Toronto/GTA From Ottawa?,"Hello everyone,

This is my first time posting in your community page and I am hoping to get some advice and feedback on a move to Toronto. I am 31 (M), single and grew up in Ottawa my entire life. Sorry If I am overwhelming you or being dramatic in this post.

I went back to school in my late twenties and graduated this year with a three-year ontario advanced diploma in Computer Engineering Technology. I am now pursuing a Bachelor of Technology-Software Engineering Technology from McMaster University. This program is entirely remote and designed only for college graduates with a three-year diploma in a related major. Maybe I will pursue a master degree in the future as well.

The best part is all classes are in the evenings, allowing for people to work full time in the day time hours. I have a classmate working full-time at Google Waterloo while pursuing this degree, another at AMD etc.

I am strongly interested in pursuing a career in AI (machine-learning) and currently in the process of building my skills on the side, and build a portfolio of solid projects to display my skills.

The thing is, Ottawa tech hub is all hardware, telecomm, optics, photonics, networks etc (Nokia, Cienna, etc).. There is barely anything here in the field of AI. I believe Toronto is the place for AI and I know its insanely competitive..

I currently work at one of the big 5 banks, in an unrelated type of role, and I have networked here and there with those in the roles I aspire to be in (machine-learning roles), and also managers. I can set up coffee chats etc when they have time. Some of the roles are remote, but the highest paying/growth potential AI roles at the bank I work at require you to be hybrid in Toronto office.

I would make the move to Toronto/GTA in maybe 2 years or so..

Also I am middle eastern and Toronto/GTA has a large community of people from my country.

Today I was feeling down thinking about moving , because I grew up here, but really there is nothing here for me. I spent time in foster care 3 or 4 times as a kid and my social circle has evaporated, people are married, working overtime etc. Sometimes I say Ottawa is a joke overall, other times I say its home. I don't have any friends with the same career interest as mine. People are cops, nurses, government workers etc.

The only person I really have is my mother who has been on social housing her entire life, with health problems. She even worked kitchen jobs in recent years to help me with some expenses while in school. My goal is to be able to fully support her until the very end, she is so kind. Its a big motivation for me to take care of all her needs and more.

I feel the need to be in an ambitious environment, one that will challenge me where I can meet new like-minded people and learn from them and grow as a person. I just feel Ottawa is full of stagnation, low ambition and mediocrity.

Anyways... please give me your thoughts... I am in in a battle between logic - which tells me to move because I am still young, single and likely have better opportunities in Toronto - versus my emotional side which keeps telling me I will miss Ottawa because its home etc and all up in my feelings.. But I feel the need to be a man and try it out.. make the move and be ambitious. Please help me override my emotional side..

Thank you for any feedback you have, and sorry for this long post, but I had to get it off my chest..",1,1760487800.0,askTO,2,0.67,False

1o6whuc,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1o6whuc/wahnhaft_v2/,Wahnhaft (v2),"# Wahnhaft By Austin Michael Bourn.

 My name is Sean. I work as a data entry clerk for a small insurance company. Every day I sit at my desk surrounded by towering stacks of paperwork. 

The task of inputting data into the computer has become a mindless routine. 

Staring at my computer screen, my eyes begin to feel heavy as I reach for my coffee. I take a sip of my mocha coffee before returning to work.

Thankfully, The coffee seemed to do the trick. I spent hours typing, but it felt like minutes.

 As I looked at the neat stack of paperwork I had just finished, I felt something like a sense of pride. 

However That warm feeling was replaced with cool dread as I saw the remaining towers of papers I needed to work on.

 I was tired, but I knew that I had a deadline. So I grabbed my coffee and took a sip. 

To my surprise, What I expected to taste and what I tasted were different things entirely. I was expecting to taste mocha, but when I took a sip of my coffee, the coffee was caramel - I hated caramel flavoring.  

I spit the vile liquid out and turned my cup, assuming I had somehow swapped cups with someone else. 

However, what I saw when I turned my cup confused me. The cup had my name on it. 

I didn't have time to think too deeply into it, I didn't want to fall behind on my work. So I tossed the coffee cup into the green trash bin under my desk and got back to it.

I typed for hours and watched as my coworkers went home for the evening. The work day ends at four but It was dark when I finished my work for the day. 

As I made my way outside, I called a cab.

I always call the same cab company when I get off work late. The driver for the night shift is always friendly and after many rides together, I consider him my friend. 

I sat on the bench outside and as I waited, I went to pull out a cigarette when  next to the pack I felt a piece of paper in my pocket. Curious, I fished the paper out of my pocket and upon further inspection, I realized that it was a receipt for the coffee I had purchased earlier.

The receipt read, one large mocha coffee.

“Isn't that odd?” I thought to myself, My thoughts of confusion however were cut short as I heard a car approaching.

 I looked up to see my favorite cab driver pulling up to the curb. I had a long day sure, but at least now I was with a friend. I waved and smiled at him.

He didn't wave or smile back. He might have even looked annoyed. Despite his seemingly annoyed state, As I entered the cab, I was excited to talk with the driver.  
However, this time, the cab felt different. The once warm and friendly cab driver that I had many enjoyable conversations with in the past now averted his gaze when he caught me studying him in the rearview mirror, as we rode in silence. 

A silence only broken once.  I asked how his day was, and he never answered. 

The only time the driver spoke to me was to verify that we were at the drop-off destination.

 I looked through the window and saw that we were. I thanked the driver and tipped him as usual.

After I paid him, He quickly drove away, as if he was in a hurry, and I wondered what had happened to change the demeanor of such a formerly friendly man.

 I walked up to my apartment building and as I approached the door to the lobby I could hear my neighbors fighting inside. 

I looked through the window and saw one of my neighbors, an elderly man in a fist fight with another tenant in the building.

 I hurriedly turned my key in the door and rushed inside. When I entered I found that the lobby was completely empty. Not only was there nobody fighting, There wasn't anyone there at all. Just me in a state of fight or flight, completely by myself.

 I felt foolish for a moment and decided that I really just needed to rest. I passed the other apartments, before quietly slipping into my apartment. 

After stumbling to my bed, I fell asleep almost instantly. I felt the world fade around me. However this rest was short lived, as I soon woke up to the sound of my phone ringing. I answered the phone and it was my boss. 

My boss told me that I was lucky I wasn't fired. Confused by this, I asked him, why?  
He told me that I didn't show up to work yesterday and that I better show up today if I wanted to keep my job.  

Before I could reply in any way, he had already hung up. I hurriedly got ready for work and called the cab company.

 As I waited for the cab to come, I smoked a cigarette.

 When the cab pulled up, I was surprised to see that the person driving it was not the morning driver, but the night-time cab driver.

 I was even more surprised that he seemed to be in a great mood. Last night was a little odd, but at least today he seemed to be back to his normal and usual self.

 We chatted and laughed the whole drive to work and it made me a lot less nervous about what I knew was going to be at the least an awkward conversation with my boss.

As I walked into the building. The lobby pulsed with the nervous energy, its very walls seeming to vibrate with my anxiety.

I made my way to my boss's office and I stood outside his door, mentally preparing myself for his lecture.

 Before I could enter his office, the door swung open, and as my boss emerged from the doorway, I was confused because he didn't seem to be angry like he was on the phone this morning.

 His eyes lit up as he saw me and he said, “ Good morning, Sean. I really appreciate you staying late yesterday.“ What should have been a moment of relief and even pride was instead a moment of confusion and dread , creating an uneasy feeling in my stomach.

 I was confused. I asked my boss why he called me this morning about me missing work the day prior. 

The smile that once seemed carved into his face dropped suddenly, replaced by a look of intense confusion. He tilted his head to the side and said, I didn't call you this morning, Sean. The unease in my stomach intensified as I slid my hand into my pocket and pulled out my phone. 

“I'm pretty sure you did. Give me one second” I said.

As my boss and I stood, each locked in this uncomfortable moment, I checked my call history. I saw that he did, in fact, call me this morning. “If you look right here, you'll see you did call me, “ I said to my boss as I handed him my phone. He took the phone and immediately froze. He looked at the phone. He looked at me. He looked back at the phone and giggled. “Sean, you do realize you handed me a dead phone, right?”

 He slid me back my phone and laughed as he said, “ You're funny, Sean. I don't always understand your humor, but I know you're funny. Have a great work day.” 

Before I could respond, he had already slid back into his office. Happy that I wasn't fired, I made my way to my desk. As I passed co-workers, they smiled at me, but I could feel their smiles fade the moment I looked away. I sat down at my desk and accidentally knocked over the bin. I went to put the bin upright, but I was thrown off by its color.

 As far back as I could remember, my trash bin, much like all the other bins in the office, was green. The bin that I was looking at was bright red.

 I heard a noise and looked up to see a co-worker walking by. Their sudden presence startled me and I blurted out, “New bins!” My co-worker looked at me like I was crazy before asking, ”What?”.

  I explained to my co-worker that my bin has been replaced by a red one. My co-worker looked at me bewildered and said something that I couldn't believe.

 “Ive Worked Here for over 20 years, the bins have always been red.” I stood up and looked at the other cubicles in the office and sure enough, under each desk every single bin was red.

 Still in disbelief, I pulled my bin from under my desk and in the bin was a disposable coffee cup with my name written on the side.

 My mind reeled and I was trying to make sense of the world around me, but it kept getting stranger. I slid my bin back under my desk and watched my co-worker walk away, clearly annoyed. 

 If my co-worker would have walked away in a way that made sense, I might have been able to explain away all the other oddities I've been experiencing. 

What they did when they walked away, however, made no sense. I watched them walk to the back of the room by the printer and straight through the white wall.

 “What the fuck? “ I said out loud as I walked to the same wall I had just watched my co-worker vanish through. I reached out and touched it. The wall was solid. There was no way that what I saw was possible. 

Thinking about it made my head hurt, but I knew that something was wrong with either reality or my perception of it.

I found my boss and told him that I needed to leave early for the day before I stepped outside and lit a cigarette. I pulled my phone out of my pocket and saw that it was fully charged.

 I called the cab company and to my surprise I heard a phone ring across the street from me. I looked up and saw the cab parked on the other side of the road.

 The driver waved me over,  I crossed the street and I got in the cab. The driver looked familiar but I couldn't remember his name. He was being very friendly, but there was something wrong with his face. I realized that while the cab driver's face looked happy and kind, his eyes looked wild and angry, almost demonic. 

I asked him what was wrong with his eyes, and he laughed in an octave I'd never heard before. for just a moment The sky darkened, and I lost my ability to breathe. The car seemed to stand still as if time had frozen. The only proof that time wasn't frozen completely was the rapid beat of my own heart pounding in my chest. 

In that moment, I felt both like I was going to die and that whatever was happening wasn't ever going to stop. However, just as quickly as it came, the moment passed. I found myself shaking and staring through my fingers at the floor. I felt cold.

  
 I was afraid to look at the driver, for fear that I would not see a friendly face. I only dared look up when I heard the driver ask me a question. In a very normal and familiar voice, the cab driver asked me,” Hey buddy, are you okay?” I looked up and recognized him as the night driver for the cab company. I told him that I was fine, just a little ill. He mentioned a doctor he was going to call on my behalf. I told him that he didn't have to but he really insisted. I thanked and paid the driver before stepping out of the cab.

  
To My absolute horror as I watched the cab drive away, it was rammed off of the road by a public bus. The bus slamming into the side of the cab forcefully,  that for a moment it looked like they became one. Like some kind of vehicular hammerhead shark.

 I blinked hard and rubbed my eyes, when my eyes readjusted, I was able to see the cab driver turn the corner of the road, driving the cab completely undamaged. There was no bus, and there was no crash. My head hurt.

  
 I decided I needed to get home. I hurried into my apartment building. In the lobby, there was nobody. However, every apartment door now stood open, even mine. I walked through the door of my apartment, but as I crossed through, I felt cold, before I exited through the front door of my office building. I was so afraid that my legs gave out and I fell on the ground. The cold concrete was a reminder that I was certainly not in my apartment. It was so cold that I instinctively jumped back up to my feet.

 I looked back at the building and it was closed. Everyone had gone home for the day. I checked my phone and this time it didn't turn on. Without another option, I decided that I would spend the evening on the bench, under a light blanket of snow. 

I woke up early the next morning, in my apartment. shivering in my warm bed.  
 I checked my phone and realized that I was going to be late for work. I hurriedly got dressed and called the cab company. As I waited for the cab to come I smoked a cigarette. When the cab driver arrived, I was nearing the end of my cigarette, so I flicked it into the street. 

As I entered, I noticed that it was a totally different cab driver. He didn't seem annoyed, but he didn't seem friendly, I assumed it must have been someone new. I asked what happened to the usual day time driver and the new cab driver told me that he was the only cab driver the company had and as far as he knew, the company he worked for didn't offer rides after 5 pm because they only had one driver. This made no sense to me, I was sure he was new. 

As we rode in silence I studied his face, it was totally unfamiliar. When he dropped me off at work, I tried to pay him, but he refused payment and gave me a card to call a doctor. I took it to be kind, but I wasn't planning on calling the doctor. 

As I stepped out of the taxi, I shuddered at the sight of the bench. I don't know if it was a dream or not that I spent the night there, but regardless, I wasn't a fan of that bench at that moment.

I looked past the bench to my job. I was eager to get back to work and get my mind off of all the craziness. I walked in, but everyone was busy working, so nobody said hi. I did, however, catch some odd glances from people before they went back to their work.

 I sat down at my desk but when I tried to log onto the computer, it told me my credentials were invalid. As I tried and failed to get into my work computer, I heard someone approaching. I looked up to see my boss coming with an angry look on his face and two armed security guards.

I tell him that I'm struggling to get into my computer and he says to me in an angry tone, “That's because it isn't your computer. You've never worked here.” I felt dizzy when i heard those words.  My boss had security escort me out of the building and as I heard the doors lock behind me, I saw the bench covered in snow, in an otherwise sunny environment, that could only be described as summer like.

 I wiped the snow off of the bench and reached into my pocket to grab my phone. Despite removing the snow the bench was still cold and wet. I sat uncomfortably and called the cab, I smoked a cigarette while I waited for it to come. 

Once I was in the cab, I heard the driver say, “short trip today.” When I looked up, I was glad to see that it was the night-time cab driver that I remembered. I was frightened by my job. I was frightened by my neighbors, and most days I was frightened by the cab.  I wondered to myself when life got so incoherent and scary. My thoughts were interrupted by the driver letting me know that we arrived at my apartment.

As I got out of the cab, I remembered that I had forgotten to pay him. So I reached into my pocket for my wallet, but I couldn't find it. When I turned around to see if I had left it in the cab, I saw that he had since left. I turned back around to face my apartment and my heart sank. It was nighttime now and I was standing in an empty lot, where a building might have once stood, but where no building stood now.  
 I stood alone in the lot and noticed snow falling. Not knowing where to go, I walked back towards the road where I found a familiar bench covered in snow. I wiped the snow away and laid down to rest. I closed my eyes, and as I drifted away from the world, I felt heavy and cold.

 I woke up to the sound of a car horn. It was the night-time cab driver. He asked me if I was getting in or not. I chose to get in. It would be a nice break from the weather. He studied me from the side of his eye and asked, “Same place as usual?” I answered yes, and as we rode, he mentioned that I should call the doctor he gave me the card for. I thanked him again for the card and reassured him I would call the doctor. He gave me a kind nod and left. As he drove off into the distance, I watched him go, but nothing crazy or unexpected happened. Maybe I don't have to call that doctor, I thought to myself.

 I turned away from the road, but what I saw didn't make any sense at all.  
 I saw that damn bench that I've suffered on so many times, and that was not a surprise to me. What surprised me, what shocked me to my core, was the decaying structure of what appeared to be a defunct, out of use building.

 The building looked similar to the one I work at but it was in such a state of disrepair it would be hard to believe anyone has been there for years. I opened the front door, and the smell of still air made the place feel extra abandoned. 

 I heard rhythmic tapping sounds from deeper into the building. I was so scared. I didn't want to search any further, but I felt like I had to. I had already gotten this far, and I wasn't sure of the alternative. I followed the sound of the typing. It grew louder as I drew closer.

 I was halfway to my destination when I realized where I was headed. I was a layer cake of dread and anxiety when I walked up to my desk. I peeked over the top of my desk, and I saw a man sitting in the dark, staring at a blank monitor, typing. I asked, who are you? The man looked up at me with what I recognized as my own face before vanishing. 

My mind struggled to grasp what was going on in front of me. I stood alone in the dark above my rotting desk for what felt like an eternity, as my mind reeled. I was about to turn away from the desk and leave. To run away from that desk, to run out of this building, to keep running until things made sense to me again, but as I went to turn away, the computer screen lit up the room.

 I turned back towards the computer and recognized the login screen. Not knowing what else to do, I put in my username and password. To my surprise my credentials worked. The computer loaded up my desktop, All of my work files were still there, but when I clicked in on them, they were all empty word documents. Hundreds of professionally labeled blank files. Other than what was missing, there was also something new. A folder on my desktop, labeled My Diagnosis. 

All of this was too much, my mind ached, my eyes burned, my stomach hurt, I felt so cold, but I had to know what was in that folder. I clicked open the folder, inside of the folder was a pdf file titled, Patient File - Sean M. I clicked it open and as I read the document. the words in the report burned in my mind.

Current Delusion: Structured employment as a 'data entry clerk' for an imaginary insurance company. Uses the abandoned former worksite as an anchor for the delusion.

Daily Behavior: Breaks into defunct job site, sits at desk, performs repetitive, meaningless actions (typing on blank documents) for eight hours. Uses public transport) to maintain the illusion of financial autonomy.

My stomach dropped out of my body. It wasn't my memory or the world that was broken; it was me. Every weird glance, every disappearing building, every change in the trash bin—it was all logged here, in my own files. I dragged my eyes from the screen, looking around the dilapidated room again. No co-workers. No stacks of paper. Just cold, still air. 

I felt the card that the cab driver had given me in my pocket, the weird things that have been happening have been terrifying, and the text on the screen was enough to seal the deal for me. I was done living this way. I was going to call the doctor. 

I pushed my hand into my pocket and pulled out the doctor's business card. I held it in my hand, studying it for a while, I knew that it was supposed to be a good thing, the thing that saves me, but it felt dangerous in my hand. I started dialing the number but as I got to the third digit I froze. I realized that I would be trading all of my comfort away for a reality I never agreed to participate in. I thought about how I would be trading all of my stability, and everything I know, for a tomorrow that was guaranteed to be worse  
A reality where I didn't have a home, a job, or any friends. 

I didn't want to do that, I felt angry, sad, and confused, but I knew what I wanted to do. I tore the card to pieces, and as each piece fell, the room changed. Until suddenly I was sitting at my desk surrounded by towering stacks of paperwork. 

On my desk was a fresh mocha coffee with my name on it. I sat down and started working. After I finished the first stack, I grabbed my coffee and took a sip. What I expected to taste and what I tasted were different things entirely. I was expecting to taste mocha.

1o6wfgd,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1o6wfgd/i_work_as_a_data_entry_clerk_for_a_small/,I work as a data entry clerk for a small insurance company," My name is Sean. I work as a data entry clerk for a small insurance company. Every day I sit at my desk surrounded by towering stacks of paperwork. 

The task of inputting data into the computer has become a mindless routine. 

Staring at my computer screen, my eyes begin to feel heavy as I reach for my coffee. I take a sip of my mocha coffee before returning to work.

Thankfully, The coffee seemed to do the trick. I spent hours typing, but it felt like minutes.

 As I looked at the neat stack of paperwork I had just finished, I felt something like a sense of pride. 

However That warm feeling was replaced with cool dread as I saw the remaining towers of papers I needed to work on.

 I was tired, but I knew that I had a deadline. So I grabbed my coffee and took a sip. 

To my surprise, What I expected to taste and what I tasted were different things entirely. I was expecting to taste mocha, but when I took a sip of my coffee, the coffee was caramel - I hated caramel flavoring.  

I spit the vile liquid out and turned my cup, assuming I had somehow swapped cups with someone else. 

However, what I saw when I turned my cup confused me. The cup had my name on it. 

I didn't have time to think too deeply into it, I didn't want to fall behind on my work. So I tossed the coffee cup into the green trash bin under my desk and got back to it.

I typed for hours and watched as my coworkers went home for the evening. The work day ends at four but It was dark when I finished my work for the day. 

As I made my way outside, I called a cab.

I always call the same cab company when I get off work late. The driver for the night shift is always friendly and after many rides together, I consider him my friend. 

I sat on the bench outside and as I waited, I went to pull out a cigarette when  next to the pack I felt a piece of paper in my pocket. Curious, I fished the paper out of my pocket and upon further inspection, I realized that it was a receipt for the coffee I had purchased earlier.

The receipt read, one large mocha coffee.

“Isn't that odd?” I thought to myself, My thoughts of confusion however were cut short as I heard a car approaching.

 I looked up to see my favorite cab driver pulling up to the curb. I had a long day sure, but at least now I was with a friend. I waved and smiled at him.

He didn't wave or smile back. He might have even looked annoyed. Despite his seemingly annoyed state, As I entered the cab, I was excited to talk with the driver.  
However, this time, the cab felt different. The once warm and friendly cab driver that I had many enjoyable conversations with in the past now averted his gaze when he caught me studying him in the rearview mirror, as we rode in silence. 

A silence only broken once.  I asked how his day was, and he never answered. 

The only time the driver spoke to me was to verify that we were at the drop-off destination.

 I looked through the window and saw that we were. I thanked the driver and tipped him as usual.

After I paid him, He quickly drove away, as if he was in a hurry, and I wondered what had happened to change the demeanor of such a formerly friendly man.

 I walked up to my apartment building and as I approached the door to the lobby I could hear my neighbors fighting inside. 

I looked through the window and saw one of my neighbors, an elderly man in a fist fight with another tenant in the building.

 I hurriedly turned my key in the door and rushed inside. When I entered I found that the lobby was completely empty. Not only was there nobody fighting, There wasn't anyone there at all. Just me in a state of fight or flight, completely by myself.

 I felt foolish for a moment and decided that I really just needed to rest. I passed the other apartments, before quietly slipping into my apartment. 

After stumbling to my bed, I fell asleep almost instantly. I felt the world fade around me. However this rest was short lived, as I soon woke up to the sound of my phone ringing. I answered the phone and it was my boss. 

My boss told me that I was lucky I wasn't fired. Confused by this, I asked him, why?  
He told me that I didn't show up to work yesterday and that I better show up today if I wanted to keep my job.  

Before I could reply in any way, he had already hung up. I hurriedly got ready for work and called the cab company.

 As I waited for the cab to come, I smoked a cigarette.

 When the cab pulled up, I was surprised to see that the person driving it was not the morning driver, but the night-time cab driver.

 I was even more surprised that he seemed to be in a great mood. Last night was a little odd, but at least today he seemed to be back to his normal and usual self.

 We chatted and laughed the whole drive to work and it made me a lot less nervous about what I knew was going to be at the least an awkward conversation with my boss.

As I walked into the building. The lobby pulsed with the nervous energy, its very walls seeming to vibrate with my anxiety.

I made my way to my boss's office and I stood outside his door, mentally preparing myself for his lecture.

 Before I could enter his office, the door swung open, and as my boss emerged from the doorway, I was confused because he didn't seem to be angry like he was on the phone this morning.

 His eyes lit up as he saw me and he said, “ Good morning, Sean. I really appreciate you staying late yesterday.“ What should have been a moment of relief and even pride was instead a moment of confusion and dread , creating an uneasy feeling in my stomach.

 I was confused. I asked my boss why he called me this morning about me missing work the day prior. 

The smile that once seemed carved into his face dropped suddenly, replaced by a look of intense confusion. He tilted his head to the side and said, I didn't call you this morning, Sean. The unease in my stomach intensified as I slid my hand into my pocket and pulled out my phone. 

“I'm pretty sure you did. Give me one second” I said.

As my boss and I stood, each locked in this uncomfortable moment, I checked my call history. I saw that he did, in fact, call me this morning. “If you look right here, you'll see you did call me, “ I said to my boss as I handed him my phone. He took the phone and immediately froze. He looked at the phone. He looked at me. He looked back at the phone and giggled. “Sean, you do realize you handed me a dead phone, right?”

 He slid me back my phone and laughed as he said, “ You're funny, Sean. I don't always understand your humor, but I know you're funny. Have a great work day.” 

Before I could respond, he had already slid back into his office. Happy that I wasn't fired, I made my way to my desk. As I passed co-workers, they smiled at me, but I could feel their smiles fade the moment I looked away. I sat down at my desk and accidentally knocked over the bin. I went to put the bin upright, but I was thrown off by its color.

 As far back as I could remember, my trash bin, much like all the other bins in the office, was green. The bin that I was looking at was bright red.

 I heard a noise and looked up to see a co-worker walking by. Their sudden presence startled me and I blurted out, “New bins!” My co-worker looked at me like I was crazy before asking, ”What?”.

  I explained to my co-worker that my bin has been replaced by a red one. My co-worker looked at me bewildered and said something that I couldn't believe.

 “I've Worked Here for over 20 years; the bins have always been red.” I stood up and looked at the other cubicles in the office and sure enough, under each desk every single bin was red.

 Still in disbelief, I pulled my bin from under my desk and in the bin was a disposable coffee cup with my name written on the side.

 My mind reeled and I was trying to make sense of the world around me, but it kept getting stranger. I slid my bin back under my desk and watched my co-worker walk away, clearly annoyed. 

 If my co-worker would have walked away in a way that made sense, I might have been able to explain away all the other oddities I've been experiencing. 

What they did when they walked away, however, made no sense. I watched them walk to the back of the room by the printer and straight through the white wall.

 “What the fuck? “ I said out loud as I walked to the same wall I had just watched my co-worker vanish through. I reached out and touched it. The wall was solid. There was no way that what I saw was possible. 

Thinking about it made my head hurt, but I knew that something was wrong with either reality or my perception of it.

I found my boss and told him that I needed to leave early for the day before I stepped outside and lit a cigarette. I pulled my phone out of my pocket and saw that it was fully charged.

 I called the cab company and to my surprise I heard a phone ring across the street from me. I looked up and saw the cab parked on the other side of the road.

 The driver waved me over,  I crossed the street and I got in the cab. The driver looked familiar but I couldn't remember his name. He was being very friendly, but there was something wrong with his face. I realized that while the cab driver's face looked happy and kind, his eyes looked wild and angry, almost demonic. 

I asked him what was wrong with his eyes, and he laughed in an octave I'd never heard before. for just a moment The sky darkened, and I lost my ability to breathe. The car seemed to stand still as if time had frozen. The only proof that time wasn't frozen completely was the rapid beat of my own heart pounding in my chest. 

In that moment, I felt both like I was going to die and that whatever was happening wasn't ever going to stop. However, just as quickly as it came, the moment passed. I found myself shaking and staring through my fingers at the floor. I felt cold.

  
 I was afraid to look at the driver, for fear that I would not see a friendly face. I only dared look up when I heard the driver ask me a question. In a very normal and familiar voice, the cab driver asked me,” Hey buddy, are you okay?” I looked up and recognized him as the night driver for the cab company. I told him that I was fine, just a little ill. He mentioned a doctor he was going to call on my behalf. I told him that he didn't have to but he really insisted. I thanked and paid the driver before stepping out of the cab.

  
To My absolute horror as I watched the cab drive away, it was rammed off of the road by a public bus. The bus slamming into the side of the cab forcefully,  that for a moment it looked like they became one. Like some kind of vehicular hammerhead shark.

 I blinked hard and rubbed my eyes, when my eyes readjusted, I was able to see the cab driver turn the corner of the road, driving the cab completely undamaged. There was no bus, and there was no crash. My head hurt.

  
 I decided I needed to get home. I hurried into my apartment building. In the lobby, there was nobody. However, every apartment door now stood open, even mine. I walked through the door of my apartment, but as I crossed through, I felt cold, before I exited through the front door of my office building. I was so afraid that my legs gave out and I fell on the ground. The cold concrete was a reminder that I was certainly not in my apartment. It was so cold that I instinctively jumped back up to my feet.

 I looked back at the building and it was closed. Everyone had gone home for the day. I checked my phone and this time it didn't turn on. Without another option, I decided that I would spend the evening on the bench, under a light blanket of snow. 

I woke up early the next morning, in my apartment. shivering in my warm bed.  
 I checked my phone and realized that I was going to be late for work. I hurriedly got dressed and called the cab company. As I waited for the cab to come I smoked a cigarette. When the cab driver arrived, I was nearing the end of my cigarette, so I flicked it into the street. 

As I entered, I noticed that it was a totally different cab driver. He didn't seem annoyed, but he didn't seem friendly, I assumed it must have been someone new. I asked what happened to the usual day time driver and the new cab driver told me that he was the only cab driver the company had and as far as he knew, the company he worked for didn't offer rides after 5 pm because they only had one driver. This made no sense to me, I was sure he was new. 

As we rode in silence I studied his face, it was totally unfamiliar. When he dropped me off at work, I tried to pay him, but he refused payment and gave me a card to call a doctor. I took it to be kind, but I wasn't planning on calling the doctor. 

As I stepped out of the taxi, I shuddered at the sight of the bench. I don't know if it was a dream or not that I spent the night there, but regardless, I wasn't a fan of that bench at that moment.

I looked past the bench to my job. I was eager to get back to work and get my mind off of all the craziness. I walked in, but everyone was busy working, so nobody said hi. I did, however, catch some odd glances from people before they went back to their work.

 I sat down at my desk but when I tried to log onto the computer, it told me my credentials were invalid. As I tried and failed to get into my work computer, I heard someone approaching. I looked up to see my boss coming with an angry look on his face and two armed security guards.

I tell him that I'm struggling to get into my computer and he says to me in an angry tone, “That's because it isn't your computer. You've never worked here.” I felt dizzy when i heard those words.  My boss had security escort me out of the building and as I heard the doors lock behind me, I saw the bench covered in snow, in an otherwise sunny environment, that could only be described as summer like.

 I wiped the snow off of the bench and reached into my pocket to grab my phone. Despite removing the snow the bench was still cold and wet. I sat uncomfortably and called the cab, I smoked a cigarette while I waited for it to come. 

Once I was in the cab, I heard the driver say, “short trip today.” When I looked up, I was glad to see that it was the night-time cab driver that I remembered. I was frightened by my job. I was frightened by my neighbors, and most days I was frightened by the cab.  I wondered to myself when life got so incoherent and scary. My thoughts were interrupted by the driver letting me know that we arrived at my apartment.

As I got out of the cab, I remembered that I had forgotten to pay him. So I reached into my pocket for my wallet, but I couldn't find it. When I turned around to see if I had left it in the cab, I saw that he had since left. I turned back around to face my apartment and my heart sank. It was nighttime now and I was standing in an empty lot, where a building might have once stood, but where no building stood now.  
 I stood alone in the lot and noticed snow falling. Not knowing where to go, I walked back towards the road where I found a familiar bench covered in snow. I wiped the snow away and laid down to rest. I closed my eyes, and as I drifted away from the world, I felt heavy and cold.

 I woke up to the sound of a car horn. It was the night-time cab driver. He asked me if I was getting in or not. I chose to get in. It would be a nice break from the weather. He studied me from the side of his eye and asked, “Same place as usual?” I answered yes, and as we rode, he mentioned that I should call the doctor he gave me the card for. I thanked him again for the card and reassured him I would call the doctor. He gave me a kind nod and left. As he drove off into the distance, I watched him go, but nothing crazy or unexpected happened. Maybe I don't have to call that doctor, I thought to myself.

 I turned away from the road, but what I saw didn't make any sense at all.  
 I saw that damn bench that I've suffered on so many times, and that was not a surprise to me. What surprised me, what shocked me to my core, was the decaying structure of what appeared to be a defunct, out of use building.

I play football (soccer) almost every evening, it’s my daily dose of cardio. I’m big into fitness too, and working out is basically my cheap therapy. I also love cooking, especially healthy stuff that tricks my brain into thinking I'm a responsible adult. If you’re into fitness, we might just be accountability buddies and can hype each other up 💪

I’ve recently fallen down the skincare rabbit hole. At this point, my face has become an experiment ground but glow goals xD 😌

I’m a huge history nerd. Give me ancient legends, epic battles, or ghost stories and I’m hooked. Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones are my comfort shows. I game too Red Dead Redemption 2 is my favourite 

I’m a full-time software engineer. But no matter how busy life gets, I always make time for a good conversation. So if anything here sounds remotely relatable or just mildly interesting drop a message. ☺️I don’t bite (but one of my cats might). 😺 ",1,1760487509.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

My boyfriend (28M) and I (27F) have been dating for the past 6 months, and overall, we have a really great relationship. He’s always there for me whenever I’m feeling down, and although I try to be there for him too, I have to admit that my life has been quite chaotic lately — so I’ve probably needed more of his support than the other way around.

He’s very supportive and almost always willing to help. He’s the kind of person who comes up with solutions, cooks for us, brings me coffee in the morning, and prepares food when I work late. Honestly, he’s amazing in so many ways.

However, there’s one thing that’s been bothering me a little. Even though we earn about the same, I’ve noticed that I’m the one who pays more often. We had very different upbringings — his parents are stricter about money, and I guess that’s partly why I tend to spend more easily than he does.

Still, I’d say about two out of three times when we go to a restaurant, I’m the one who pays. I also enjoy giving spontaneous gifts — sometimes small ($20) and sometimes more expensive ($200). In total, I think I’ve spent around $500 on gifts for him so far.

Now, I do believe relationships are about give and take, and money isn’t the only way to give. We definitely have different views about spending — he’s more frugal and prefers cooking at home rather than eating out. When we talked about this once, he even said that I “give a lot” and that he sometimes feels like he can’t keep up, which I understand. I know not everyone expresses love the same way I do.

The issue is that my friends, who I know genuinely care about me, have told me to be careful and make sure I’m not being used. Unfortunately, that got into my head, and I started being more cautious about our spending. I began noticing little things, like when he didn’t take out his card at dinner or when he asked me to send him my share afterward.

Now I feel confused — I don’t want to be suspicious and ruin a good relationship if there’s nothing wrong, but I also don’t want to ignore a potential imbalance.

I actually brought it up with him (it was a bit awkward), and we agreed to start keeping a shared “bookkeeping” log to make things more transparent. My friends, however, think we should first address the “historical costs” — meaning that he should catch up financially, especially since I’ve spent quite a lot already.

My boyfriend, on the other hand, said it would be too hard to track all our past expenses since our bank apps don’t clearly show who paid for what. He suggested instead that he’ll invite me to a few nice dinners to make up for it — though that hasn’t happened yet.

So… I’m torn. I don’t think he’s a bad person or that he’s trying to use me, but I can’t shake the worry that I’m contributing more financially and that he might be a bit too comfortable with that dynamic.

What do you think? Am I overthinking this, or is it something I should keep an eye on?",1,1760487483.0,relationships_advice,3,1.0,False
1o6wdn3,https://www.reddit.com/r/30PlusSkinCare/comments/1o6wdn3/my_stupidly_simple_system_for_tracking_water/,My stupidly simple system for tracking water intake (because my skin was paying for my forgetfulness),"I spent $300 on serums last month and my skin still looked dull. Then my dermatologist asked the most obvious question: ""Are you drinking enough water?""

Honestly had no clue. I'd have coffee all morning, maybe a glass at lunch, wine at dinner. That was it.

Here's the boring system I set up that actually worked:

Morning: WaterMinder sends first reminder at 7am. I keep a 20oz glass by the coffee maker. Drink it before coffee happens.

Midday: Set reminders for 11am and 2pm. These are my ""danger zone"" hours where I'd go 4+ hours without water. The Apple Watch tap is just enough to make me stop and drink.

Evening: Goal is to front load hydration so I'm not chugging water at 10pm. App tracks if I'm on pace.

I'm not going to say my skin looks like I'm 25 again (I'm 38, let's be realistic). But after six weeks? The texture is noticeably better. Less dry patches. Foundation sits better.

The annoying part: The app sometimes nags when I don't want it to. But honestly, that's kind of the point. I needed the nagging.

What's worked for you? Any other ""obvious"" hydration tricks I'm missing?",4,1760487466.0,30PlusSkinCare,2,1.0,False

1o6w9a0,https://i.redd.it/4f2d5ay246vf1.jpeg,Get Used To It - Bills Are With Us For Life - But We Don’t Have To Let Them Cripple Us 🌹🪽,"Let me give you a tip. My grandmother taught me this when I left home. I won’t tell you how long ago that was otherwise I’m going to give away my age but I’ve carried this with me my whole life and I’ve passed it on to my girls who now follow the same adage.

When you get your bill if you get this every quarter which I’m sure most of you do what you do is you divided by four so you can see what you’re paying per month roughly. Then what you do is you divide that amount by four again so that you are seeing what you would be paying per week.

Now depending on whether you get paid fortnightly or weekly you would pay that amount per week or per fortnight towards your bill using BPay (and for those who don’t know the word Fortnite that’s every two weeks) plus an additional $10 per week.

EXAMPLE 
So let’s say the electricity bill is $600 
You would work it out to be a monthly fee of $150 
Then the weekly fee would be $37.50 
So you would pay the weekly fee plus (if you can) you could pay an extra $10 or $20 per week or fortnight. ie: $47.50 or $57.50

By the time your next bill comes in, if you start at the beginning of the first bill being paid, you will find you will not only have the next bill paid in full by the time it comes in but you will also have credit on that bill.

Then if you keep paying towards that bill every fortnight or every week depending on your pay cycle pay whatever that weeks breakdown would be plus an additional $10 or $20 if you can afford it, you will then discover that eventually you will get so far ahead in credit that you can have a Bill holiday.

I’ve had bills come in that have zero owing on them because of this method which is a very simple easy to do method. When you get into a habit of doing this you will be amazed at the pressure it takes off you when the bills come in imagine opening a bill to see nothing owing but there is credit showing? It’s a bloody good feeling! Sometimes you can’t always do it because other things can take a priority but at least you know when the bill comes in it’s not going to be as exuberant as it would be if you hadn’t put anything towards it and I’m not talking about just putting money aside, which can be an easy temptation to use because it’s sitting there accessible to you, I’m talking about using the BPay system to actually forward the payment directly to that bill so it is out of your hands and on that bill. Because regardless it has to be paid and it’s better to have it with a little bit of credit there now before you get hit with one extreme shock when the bill comes in.

There was one stage I was 6 months ahead in my bills that you might say that’s crazy but think of what you would normally waste money on. You might spend money on takeaway that you really don’t need when you could make something easy at home. You might spend money in a cafeteria on a cake and a coffee. Those little things add up and if you could consider putting that towards your bills and paying them happily you will find because bills are a part of life and we have to pay them. You will be stressfree and you will not have the exuberant bills.

The other thing to take into account if you don’t have to do it on every single bill leaving yourself short just start with the biggest ones or just one once you get that under control then you’ve got enough to put towards the others regardless of how we say it bills are something we have to live with so if we can design our life in a way that’s not going to be stressful and paying that bill we will be able to cope much better and eliminate so much pressure from ourselves and our way of living. If you get extra money like a bonus I know many people will cringe at this but trust me put at least $100 of that bonus if you can afford it on top of your most extreme bill even if it’s to do with a mortgage put some towards that mortgage so that way you’re getting it cleared out of the way sooner. Sometimes we get our bonuses and we spend it frivolously on things like holidays and stuff like that in years I’m not saying you don’t deserve a holiday but you still have to face the bill.

For example I have attached a screenshot of one of my bills I missed a couple of weeks and had I kept consistent I would have owed zero $s however as you can see it greatly reduced the amount owed as the total amount of the actual bill was $579.97 however, because I otherwise paid extra every time I had pay I only owed $189.67

I hope this helps those who need help in getting on top of their bills. 

Here’s another thing if you haven’t already heard about it, ING Banking offer a refer a friend option. Where if you sign up to ING banking and you refer a friend using your friends code you get paid by ING $100 and so does your friend.

My code is CAX832 in addition you would be given a code to share and if you refer friends they  each get paid $100 and so do you. 
It is legit and legal and think about that how could go towards your bills.

Good luck with your bills and may you eliminate the stress they create.🌹

1o6w94a,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1o6w94a/title_twin_i_thought_i_was_living_a_café_romcom/,Title: Twin I thought I was living a café romcom but I just got humbled 😭☕,"So this happened the other night at work. It was one of those quiet nights — like *peaceful but awkward* quiet — where I’m just cleaning and pretending to look busy.

His mom walks up and orders a hot cocoa, then she turns to him and goes, “What do you want?”

He comes up all casual and goes, “Do you guys have coffee?”  
And twin — I did *the stinkiest* side-eye in my head but kept that customer service smile 😭 Like… sir. It’s literally a café.

So I’m like, “Yeah,” and he goes, “Can I get a vanilla iced coffee?” I said sure, his mom paid, and then he disappeared for a bit (pretty sure he went to the bathroom).

I call the drink out, his mom grabs it, and a few minutes later I’m pulling the trash bag out of the can — which btw, I only take *one bag* out at a time because I’m lazy 😭 I’ll literally tape an “out of order” sign on the other trash can so I can get it done fast, make myself a drink, and chill for the last 30 minutes before close.

Anyway, I’m lifting the trash bag and he stands up, so I hold it open like, “You can throw it in here.” He tosses his cup in perfectly, but two little pieces of trash fall out — a coffee sleeve and a tiny piece of plastic — and he actually bends down and picks them up (like okay, respectful king ✨).

Then he looks at me and goes, “I like your pins.”  
I said, “Thanks — which ones?”

He points at the one near my collarbone, pokes it (it was my *pride pin*), then moves my tie a little and pokes my *transgender pin* and goes, “That one.” Then he asks where I got them and tells me I should get a *bisexual one* too 😭 like okay, advocacy and a little flirty??

So I tell him I like his shirt — it looked vintage — and ask if he plays sports. He says he *used to* play soccer. Then he asks what age we hire at, I say 15 or 16, and ask how old he is — he says 16.

I tell him he can apply online or come to our hiring event on the 18th for on-the-spot interviews. Then I hand him my notepad and tell him to write down his name and number for the managers.

He goes back to sit with his mom, then comes back up a minute later and hands me a sticky note with his info — but not my notepad 💀  
He’s like, “Sorry, I put my landline on there because my phone’s broken, but I’m getting it fixed eventually.”

Then they leave… but a few minutes later he comes *back again* like, “Sorry, I took your notepad.” I laugh and go, “You’re fine — can I give you my number?”

And twin, he looked *so surprised* — like a mix of “oh?? for me??” but also lowkey *happy* I asked. He smiled and said sure.

When he left, he waved at me from like 200 feet away — and I had a customer, so I just gave him a little wave back, smiling like an idiot.

And I was smiling the rest of the night thinking I just had my little café romcom moment.

But TWIN 😭 I got a little stalker-y. I asked one of my friends who’s in his grade if they knew him, and they did. So I found his TikTok… and twin. He has. a. *girlfriend.* 😭

And he never texted me back either. So yeah, my little “love over iced coffee” moment ended with me getting humbled.",1,1760487113.0,stories,1,0.99,False

1: characters have to be created after 64's release (January 21st 1999). |

2: 1 optional IRL character per roster (debut not created)

3: But no IRL politics. |

4: Anime is allowed|

5: (can't believe I'm saying it but) actual sentient characters only. (blame PMK-3 for me establishing this rule) |

6: characters that people know, people like a random person who isn't named enjoying a coffee and is never shown again won't count (blame PMK-3 for me establishing this rule) |

7: don't downvote, if you see a submission you don't like, ignore it, don't downvote it. |

I usually add the character at around 7:00 PM (in Massachusetts time) (or 1 hour before I post)|

If a tie happens I'll have to consult.... The Wheel. |

Turns out, keeping your drains clean isn’t rocket science—it’s more about consistent habits than anything fancy. After a bit of trial and error and a few messy situations, here’s what really helps keep things running smoothly.

**1. Flush with Hot Water (Seriously, It Helps)**  
Just pouring hot water down the drain once a week can make a big difference. It melts away grease and soap buildup before it hardens. I’ve also tried adding baking soda and vinegar; it fizzes a bit, but it actually clears minor clogs and smells better afterward.

**2. Don’t Pour Grease Down the Sink**  
This one’s a classic mistake. Grease turns solid once it cools, and that’s how pipes get blocked. I started collecting leftover oil in a jar instead of pouring it down the drain, and it’s made a huge difference in how fast the water flows.

**3. Use a Strainer (You’ll Thank Yourself Later)**  
A simple mesh strainer over the drain catches food bits and coffee grounds before they get in the pipes. It’s not fancy, but it prevents a lot of annoying blockages. Just remember to clean it out regularly.

**4. Know When to Call in the Pros**  
If the drain keeps clogging, smells weird, or takes forever to clear even after you’ve tried everything, it’s probably time to get it checked. Sometimes buildup is deep in the pipes and needs proper cleaning equipment to fix.

**5. Do Routine Checkups**  
Even if things seem fine, having your plumbing inspected once in a while helps catch small issues before they become major ones. Preventive maintenance always ends up cheaper than emergency repairs.

Keeping your kitchen drain clean is mostly about small, consistent habits. Flush it regularly, don’t dump grease, use a strainer, and get it checked if something feels off. It’s simple, but it saves you from a lot of stress and smells in the long run.

I'm applying one pump with my finger at 8-10 am, then I lay down awhile and read while letting it do it's thing. I make sure to do my bouncy housework and exercising before I apply. Also, I make sure I've finished peeing out my coffee so I can hang onto all the cream as long as possible.

I am noticing I am quicker to get to sleep. I also have the ability to take a deep power nap. I'm still getting up between 3-4:30am, but I feel smashing, so who cares if it is dark out still.

I had two mornings with some pink discharge, but it wasn't a concern, as it is still early days. No aching breasts. No skin eruptions.

I am supplementing with lugols solution(4 drops), vitamin d3 and k2, and some osteo bioflex. 

My crunchy joints are slightly less stuck. Still ache, especially my shoulders and elbows. They feel like I've been carrying kettle balls all day. 

My bloating is marginally better. I FEEL good in my head, so I just removed the too small clothes from my sight, and am adjusting to a plumper form. Not loving that, but it is very secondary to having less static and deluge in my head.

My natural self really is an organizational wiz, but it has been a lot of willpower and procrastination in my processes. That is going away. I feel that is utterly subjective, but I am able to put things away promptly, and also am enjoying taking things out to use. It is like every day feels like spring cleaning, in a fired up manner.

I structure a walk into my day. I'd say the last four days, I have relished my walk. I also have been lengthening them. I'm not sore from the exercise. 

I feel, with the single pump, I'm not getting a consistent level, and so there's a bit of yo-yo aspect. I'm assuming when I've been doing this a couple more months, I'll be ready to gauge more accurately where the process is at.

Customer service at Inner Balance has been exemplary.

So a week ago, my husband caught me sneaking wine from a secret bottle. I told him the truth, that I had a problem stopping and I knew he’d know I was drinking too much so I hid the bottle. He was obviously disappointed, but we had a good talk and I felt like I was ready to quit. 

Fast forward a week, and we went away with his family. It was UTTER CHAOS the entire time (shared house of 10 people: 4 kids, 4 adults, and my in laws). The kids (not mine) were absolutely crazy. Pouting crying freaking out whining ALL weekend, literally all weekend, non stop. And then my SIL screaming at them all weekend because of their poor behavior . It was so awful but we couldn’t leave. My husband was like, “i know you wanna drink, so let’s just drink this weekend and then we’ll be done”. I felt literal relief, so I said ok. 

So drank my normal amount and woke up the next morning feeling “fine”. But between more and more and more chaos, too much coffee, too much wine, and too little sleep, I ended up having a panic attack. I’ve never had one before, and it was awful. I thought I was having a heart attack, and I was going to die in front of my kids. I got control of myself, and felt a lot better after a few hours, and didn’t drink again. 

I’ve never felt that way before. It was so scary and awful. I realize now I need to make some big changes in my life, #1 is alcohol, and I’m finally really actually ready to change. 

I still feel a bit panicky today (this happened Saturday) but I just keep chugging water, trying to eat decently, I had magnesium, and I met with my therapist today. I know after a few days I’ll be ok, and I never have to feel that way again! ",7,1760486380.0,stopdrinking,2,1.0,False

I wake up without an alarm, actually eat breakfast, take short walks between meetings, and still get more done than I ever did commuting an hour each way.

I do enjoy working from home, but one thing I find myself missing a bit is structure. There are these quiet gaps between meetings where I could be doing chores or errands, but I just don’t. Some mornings I’ll get up early and work out, other days I’ll roll straight from bed to my desk. There’s no real rhythm to it. It feels like I’ve “bought” this free time back from commuting, so I don’t mind wasting it, even though part of me wishes I used it better. Sometimes I miss that sense of routine that the office used to force on you, even if it came with all the downsides...idk

A few of my long-term remote friends have mentioned they can feel a bit lonely sometimes too, since the usual coffee catch up or quick yarn in the hallway isn’t an option (at least if fully remote). I get that. There’s definitely a social side that’s hard to replace when everyone’s at home lol.

Still, when I think about how normal it used to feel to lose 10 hours a week sitting in traffic, it’s hard to imagine giving that time away again. Maybe I’d consider going back if the culture was amazing or if they offered a 30% pay bump, but honestly, I don’t know if it would be worth it.

1o6vx1g,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1o6vx1g/trauma_from_drinking_in_pastcurrent_relationship/,Trauma from drinking in past(current?) relationship,"
Okay major long story short vibes. 

Backstory on my ex: wonderful person, prom queen, best friend you can hope for, hard working, makes friends wherever she goes, loves her family, loves animals, sparks any room up, always on the move, loves the outdoors, loyal, beautiful, smart, funny, great cook. You get it, she’s a great person. 

Okay so my ex and I met back in 2022. I already knew I had a drinking problem. I told her and multiple times tried to get sober before we moved 13 hours away from home. I also cut off all my friends at this time so we were pretty codependent on each other. 

Anyways, drinking got bad, horrible even, she never once was cruel to me. She gave me love when I needed it the most and deserved it the least. There was one night I was sobbing on the floor begging god to give me the strength to stop and she picked me up took me to the bathroom and washed my hair. She never gave up. I went to rehab at one point but had to leave (for completely valid reasons) after 3 days. She always welcomed me back and tried new ways to get me happy again, to get me sober. She really did have a white knuckle dying grip. She believed in me. 

By the end of 2024, it was the worst year of both of our lives, I was barely alive at this point, depressed as anyone could possibly be. I finally broke it off. I had tried before multiple times, begging her to let me go, she did not. She knows that this was a mistake of hers now.  I couldn’t watch her spark fade away day by day because of my actions. But I also couldn’t get sober because of the immense guilt I felt everyday. We had some issues we couldn’t fix because I couldn’t stop drinking, but I couldn’t stop drinking because of the issuers. Catch 2/ vibes. I know they tell you that you can’t get sober alone but I did. I unfortunately knew that was always going to be the only way for me. Alone. 

Anyways, fast forward 9 months. I’m 4 months sober. It’s been weird at times but definitely not as hard as the last attempts of mine. I have no plan to drink again and there are few aspects of it that I miss. (It helps that I almost never had fun drinking, most of the time I spent crying wanting to stop). 

We started talking again. She still is deeply in love with me and would leap at the chance to get back together. We were having so much fun at first. It was nice, no one in any space is laughing as much as us. We morph almost perfectly. 

But then one day, she looks at me with complete love in her eyes and I am “triggered” by the memories of her looking at me with love and me feeling guilty,  knowing I was hurting someone that I loved and looked at me that way. One day we got coffee again and I was back in 2024, being unreasonably pissy with her. We got back to the apartment we used to share (she moved out, I work Nextdoor, it would be weird for her to stay and me still show up in the parking lot.) and I felt as if I was reliving 2024, scared, depressed, feeling in danger, trapped. At one point I saw the wall vibrate behind her and it was so weird i genuinely thought I was back there. 

I don’t know if I can get over our traumatic history. I forgive myself for a lot of it. But I don’t know if I could ever look at her and not remember all the horrible situations I put us through. Almost all of her best memories of us are tainted in my own memory by what I was drinking behind her back or other actions of mine. 

Should I try again? Or should I just let her go? She keeps saying she won’t get over me and that it will never feel right with another person. Thing is, I know that’s just something people say, but I do believe her when she says  it…

I know I can love again, I do, but I really want it to be her. I know I could shove it under the rug and deal with it slowly, and just be happy with something new.  I wish it was her. I feel the need to walk away and start fresh again. I don’t understand how I can feel that need while also walking away from the best person I have ever met. ",3,1760486202.0,stopdrinking,0,1.0,False

I think there's a general consensus around the valved bags being a pretty good way to store coffee, and an open sack is not so ideal, right? If I'm going to spend over 10c a gram for high end coffee, I'd really rather have it not go off before I finish consuming it. Skylark is far from the only offender here. I've already stopped buying Counter Culture unless it's massively discounted for this same reason. 

  
Is this an overreaction? Is it really more environmental if I have to put it in an airscape/atmos or supply my own plastic bag to keep it fresh?",0,1760486120.0,pourover,21,0.5,False

Okay major long story short vibes. 

Backstory on my ex: wonderful person, prom queen, best friend you can hope for, hard working, makes friends wherever she goes, loves her family, loves animals, sparks any room up, always on the move, loves the outdoors, loyal, beautiful, smart, funny, great cook. You get it, she’s a great person. 

Okay so my ex and I met back in 2022. I already knew I had a drinking problem. I told her and multiple times tried to get sober before we moved 13 hours away from home. I also cut off all my friends at this time so we were pretty codependent on each other. 

Anyways, drinking got bad, horrible even, she never once was cruel to me. She gave me love when I needed it the most and deserved it the least. There was one night I was sobbing on the floor begging god to give me the strength to stop and she picked me up took me to the bathroom and washed my hair. She never gave up. I went to rehab at one point but had to leave (for completely valid reasons) after 3 days. She always welcomed me back and tried new ways to get me happy again, to get me sober. She really did have a white knuckle dying grip. She believed in me. 

By the end of 2024, it was the worst year of both of our lives, I was barely alive at this point, depressed as anyone could possibly be. I finally broke it off. I had tried before multiple times, begging her to let me go, she did not. She knows that this was a mistake of hers now.  I couldn’t watch her spark fade away day by day because of my actions. But I also couldn’t get sober because of the immense guilt I felt everyday. We had some issues we couldn’t fix because I couldn’t stop drinking, but I couldn’t stop drinking because of the issuers. Catch 2/ vibes. I know they tell you that you can’t get sober alone but I did. I unfortunately knew that was always going to be the only way for me. Alone. 

Anyways, fast forward 9 months. I’m 4 months sober. It’s been weird at times but definitely not as hard as the last attempts of mine. I have no plan to drink again and there are few aspects of it that I miss. (It helps that I almost never had fun drinking, most of the time I spent crying wanting to stop). 

We started talking again. She still is deeply in love with me and would leap at the chance to get back together. We were having so much fun at first. It was nice, no one in any space is laughing as much as us. We morph almost perfectly. 

But then one day, she looks at me with complete love in her eyes and I am “triggered” by the memories of her looking at me with love and me feeling guilty,  knowing I was hurting someone that I loved and looked at me that way. One day we got coffee again and I was back in 2024, being unreasonably pissy with her. We got back to the apartment we used to share (she moved out, I work Nextdoor, it would be weird for her to stay and me still show up in the parking lot.) and I felt as if I was reliving 2024, scared, depressed, feeling in danger, trapped. At one point I saw the wall vibrate behind her and it was so weird i genuinely thought I was back there. 

I don’t know if I can get over our traumatic history. I forgive myself for a lot of it. But I don’t know if I could ever look at her and not remember all the horrible situations I put us through. Almost all of her best memories of us are tainted in my own memory by what I was drinking behind her back or other actions of mine. 

Should I try again? Or should I just let her go? She keeps saying she won’t get over me and that it will never feel right with another person. Thing is, I know that’s just something people say, but I do believe her when she says  it…

I know I can love again, I do, but I really want it to be her. I know I could shove it under the rug and deal with it slowly, and just be happy with something new.  I wish it was her. I feel the need to walk away and start fresh again. I don’t understand how I can feel that need while also walking away from the best person I have ever met. ",1,1760486103.0,CPTSD,1,1.0,False

He will be prophet for a loooonnng time and has no “training” so seems odd he was snubbed. But this is worse for what I thought would be Oaks’ ultimate agenda…

I believe he’s going to call Dube or some other black apostle in a progressive nod to detractors and to show how inclusive he is. Then he and fellow esquire D Todd are gonna wreak havoc on two main things:

1. Anti LGBTQ agenda. They will canonize Proclamation as doctrine. And push the nuclear family agenda which will alienate many members

2. “Freedom of religion”. This caters to right wing persecution complex that religion is somehow under attack in America when literally the exact opposite is happening. Christian nationalism is rising and never had more power or funding. 

A real prophet that could see around corners would call this out for what it is. Cowards who just want money and power will cater to our “Christian friends” (that a few weeks ago tried to shoot up a building and burn alive an entire congregation) and become more mainstream

Ultimately this will lead to the line between Mormonism and regular American Christians as pretty blurry. We will continue to step away from truth claims because they are untenable and false but that will lead this younger generation and their kids to only be tied to the church in superficial “Happy Jesus” church ways. 

This will lead to more members leaving as they see little value in a religion that demands so much. They can have “Happy Jesus church” on any corner in America. This will lead the church to soften stances on coffee and garments. And I actually think tithing too. 

But the Oaks presidency is going to continue his life long work of using his legal knowledges to drum up bogus “doctrines”. Nelson’s ego was in his temple buildings and “Mormon” name. Oaks is Proclamation. 

This will happen.

Neither of us noticed it until my sister amd neice seen it on the cup and asked my mother who the hell wrote that. She tried laughing it off to not make a big deal of it. After we realized i called the store to see what the hell happened amd to lodge a complaint and employee that is accused proceeded to say no to my request for manager or follow up for a complaint and said to f off and then i hung up as it was going no where. When i went to the store and brought it up to managment today they tryed brushing it off and tryied to deny my alligation infront of customers in the open without fully looking at the lid or situation that very clearly says slut on it.

I contacted corporate to start a complaint at a higher level. This is not the first time that a similar situation has happened here where the same managers didnt follow through or look into any complaints/allegations of employees writting obscenities on peoples cups or making rude/very offensive comments to customers.

Calling out all the serious metalheads and alternative Redditors here that are looking for serious connections with a booming friendship. No comments. I only accept messages only. Check out my profile.,"Even in Arcadia I'll wait for those serious connections while I'll randomly sing lines from Sleep Token. U..S Your location can be anywhere.

I thought I would come back with better posts and my last post here, so that way won't be seen as spam, however since people are asking for proof that I'm not an A.I. bot and apparently I'm ''fake.'' 

I'll be singing a few voice clips or video clips on my Discord server as proof that I'm real. However, it's really funny that some people think I'm fake, when I can't even fake a personality to begin with it all and the only thing I've faked is probably my autistic mask. Which, I've tossed that aside and let myself shine, vibe, feel the flow of music and if nobody likes my quirky being of a person and that's your own bull shit problem of it all. 

Which as a friend possible friend of yours, I understand if you to are tired of hearing people how are you every single day, what do you want me to tell you every single day that I'm just ''existing here?'' 

I don't think I'll ever have a day in my life where I'm doing bunny hops in my mind happily and I don't understand why people ask how someone is doing every single day to begin with. However, I don't think I need to be questioned as a friend about how introverted I really am.

A lot of people think I'm joking that I'm an introvert, however I only go outside once or twice a week, then I hide in the complex for 5 or even 7 days. I hide yeah, as I've a mild phobia of being outside and with people. I only go out really to go get my groceries, go out to get my energy drinks, tea, get cat supplies, or if a Mcdonald's iced french vanilla coffee is calling me or a caramel iced coffee and sometimes Starbucks will hit. 

I did make a critical decision in my life, that at 33 years old, I don't even want to try to work for people even though I tried to be a citizen and do citizen things a few years back that wasn't really for me and I enjoy the mild hermit lifestyle. 

Which yeah, I live off of SSI and EBT obviously, but I personally believe some people are way too sensitive of a soul or spirit to be within a lot of human contact it's too draining and which that being said I think that is enough of my woe is me party going on in this subreddit.

Your chat requests has to get my attention by the way, no one liners, nothing too basic and nothing too ordinary. Maybe something medium or long winded and if you know Sleep Token, then hit me up with some lines from one of their songs or do a Sleep Token song pun about our friendship. Either one of these options will get my attention!

Which yeha, you know maybe when I signed up my username 'dry arrival.'' was/were a divine sign from the universe when I signed up that my fated destiny on Reddit would become a ''dry arrival.'' at the end of it all. 

I'd accept friend requests that are in their mid 20s, I don't think it's that weird for a 33F to chat with someone just somewhat a few years younger than her and I think that's an okay with me if you really feel there is a ''click.''",1,1760485675.0,textfriends,1,1.0,False

When I glanced at the mirror,I was surprised to see a
reflection.
My skin, so ghostly pale,my veins, a blueish hue,
and my knuckles blushed a light magenta.

I thought I liked the quiet,but these days I argued with the wallsand whispered to the floorboards.Occasionally, I sang ballads in the shower,
And communed with the dead. 

My body often sprawled
across the exquisite tiling,watching the dust collect.Staring at the poorly painted cornices,
And the ornate plasterwork.

I watched television upside down, 
And started drawing on the walls. 

It was nice not to exist—until I’d slip out to buy milkand no one looked me in the eye.

I felt the weight of their glares on my back.The world dizzied,and I felt last night’s tea rise in my throat.

Something was wrong with me again.And still, no one had called.

As the frost nipped at my noseand rouged my cheeks,I remembered my hunger to be left alone.

Staring at my vomit and the spilled milkon the sidewalk,I realised I had no one to blame but myself.

And yet, I laughed at my own demise—despite the scrape on my kneeand the grave I had dug for myself.

My eyes, the colour of black coffee,
Flooded with tears,
And my face fell into my frostbitten hands.

The sway of the treesand the rain that began to fall,almost felt like a friend.

Oh, how I missed my friends.

Once he was in a rage and put holes in the wall in front of me and my sister. I think i was 10. I remember he threw a pizza at my mom once, and once on easter he threw coffee inside and it was everywhere. I remember when i was 10 he told me he was leaving and i was “90% of this shit”. He once said he wishes i wasnt born, think i was 11. When i was 19 he ban ged his head on the wall and ran to his shed told me he was gonna  end  himself. i was dialing in 9 1 1 just so happen my mom pulled in the driveway. I remember on 4th july he woke and up freaked out for no reason and woke me and my sister up in a rage. i was probably 10. Once when i was 5 i asked him to help me with my legos and he grabbed it from me, looked at it, then threw it. When i was 12 he got in road rage with a biker and the biker said  some stuff. . i was terrifi ed.. My dad told me to suck it up or whatrver the fuck he said. Once he broke a light by throwing pencil holder. He threatened me of my life when i was 18 cuz i didnt go home  one night bc well, i hated him then too. And this is just the stuff that comes to the top of my head. Hes ruined vacations, holidays, etc

When i was 17 him and my uncle got in a huge blow out  at 3am. He pushed my uncle, uncle ran to closet for his you know what… Scariest thing ever, i got  my mom and we ran.  9 1 1 came. Thanks to the both of them.

1o6vdkt,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1o6vdkt/what_we_lost_in_the_war/,what we lost in the war,"Most children in Scotland will be taught at some point about the Scottish Wars for Independence, some iterations a little more biased or reserved than others. 
	
I remember how when I was a kid, maybe eight or nine, our old history teachers got our class together to record a reenactment of the battle of Falkirk, each of us ecstatic as we donned face paint and fake tartan and prepared to swordfight the other class. The B class wore the funny red coats of the Englishmen which were really far too big on most of them. We each fought valiantly for our faux countries, our teachers cheering and booing when the drama swelled. 

History is never really gone, after all. We relive it every day. The wars that happened in Scotland hundreds of years ago still have a tight hold on the geopolitics of today. It is impossible to fully understand the country without being aware of this aspect of its history. History is always behind us and around us and ahead of us. It makes you feel tiny and huge in the same breath - one day, we too will become dust left behind to be discovered by the next generations of students. Perhaps they’ll find that video, assessing the lightness with which young children first address this complex issue of colonial history and identity, how the nuances of war can be reduced to play in a classroom.  

Perhaps they’ll find this account. 	
	
Last year was my first time on the Isle of Skye. I came from Dalneigh on the mainland, from where I had taken my mother’s Fiat Doblo, leaving nothing in my wake but a yellow post-it note assuring mum that I wasn’t dead. A year on, I really couldn't tell you what exactly was going through my head at the time. Maybe I was insane, just for a little while. I remember driving across the Kyle of Lochalsh with a thrilling kind of madness. The only way I can describe that kind of mania is like falling through the sky. You're seconds away from painting the ground below with your guts. In the meantime, all you can do is just enjoy the ride. 

I was eighteen and I hadn't even passed my driving test, though I had been doing lessons for a while. What I drove with was a delusional kind of confidence that I would just figure it out along the way. If I wrapped the car around a tree, well, I wouldn't have to worry about the aftermath anyways. 
	
I wasn’t suicidal. Not exactly. I wasn't trying to kill myself, but I certainly wasn't not trying. I was a straight A’s student set to study Medicine at the University of Edinburgh by that September, I had a few close friends, I got along well with my family. To unseeing eyes, I was the image of stability. But when I turned eighteen, I realised that not once in my whole life had I ever even tried to break the rules. It had simply never occurred to me. I could see the future stretch out beyond me, following in the footsteps of my mother and father who met over an operating table of all things. I had drifted through life with the vague but certain knowledge that I should have a good career, I should be successful, I should be well liked, palatable.
I was soulless perfection. I was a zombie. 
	
Of course I didn’t want to die. For once in my life, I wanted to feel alive. 
	
And let me tell you, camping, I soon learned, is an excellent way to do so. Especially when you haven't exactly done it much, and the rain is starting to come down ferociously in Portree, and you can’t quite remember how to set up your goddamn tent, which if done incorrectly, will leave you and all your sleeping kit utterly drenched by the morning, which of course, is exactly what happened. 
	
That's the funny thing about impulse; the weather is rarely sympathetic to your cause, no less in the Highlands.
	
By four in the morning, realising that I was only getting soggier the longer I stayed in the tent, I dragged myself out, staring daggers into the hole I had ripped near the left door; the cause of my misery. I walked back to where I had parked the car, and after rummaging around for some dry clothes, turned the heating up high and tried to catch a few extra hours of sleep. 
	
It didn't take long to figure out that spending the rest of the week sleeping in the car wasn't exactly sustainable. I didn't have much cash and if I wanted to get back home, I couldn't exactly afford to waste fuel on heating. I had a few options; I could turn the car around and drive three hours back home. I’d only been gone one night. Maybe I could make it back before anyone really gets worried. I would go home, but what then? Back to the mind-numbing retail 9-5 until I moved away and committed to endless studying? No, I wanted to keep on driving, even just for a little while. If I drove fast enough, the future wouldn't catch up to me. 

I revised the little to-do list I had made. If the weather stayed the way it was, which according to my phone, it intended to, exploring the Storr and the Quirang were off the table, let alone the Spar Cave and its temperamental tides. I wasn't getting stuck underground for the next few days due to poor planning. 
	
Turning around would have been the wise thing to do. I wouldn't be writing this down if I had. Instead, I stopped into the nearest bookstore and picked up a bothy map of Skye. It was perfect; free lodgings, a scenic drive, and an hour hike to the top of Rubha Hunnish where the unmanned former lookout would be waiting to receive me. All I had to do was plug the destination into my GPS. 
	
So, there I stood, donning my waterproofs, a knitted hat which would soon be unfortunately blown off my head, and a bitter taste by the name of regret beginning to rise in my throat. Screwfaced and bleary eyed, I left my car behind and began to make my way towards the mountain. 

Just before Rubha, you must pass through the abandoned village of Duntlum. There is a castle hidden there, or at least the ruins of one, a former monolith that should have towered over the landscape. There were spirits up here, according to the handbook I had picked up. Once upon a time, members of Highland nobility stayed here. It was not uncommon for these people to take in travellers, usually those from local villages heading towards the sea to give their praises to the divinities they believed to be there. They say that one day, a stranger traipsed his way into the castle. He was malnourished, and when welcomed in by the family, tucked into his serving of bread and meats like a madman. He stayed with the family for just a week, until one day, he and the family had disappeared without a trace. The only sign that life had ever once inhabited the castle was a fractured segment of the jawbone belonging to the patriarch of the house, identified by the two silver teeth perched in it. Strangely, they appeared to have been chewed on.

They say that something still lurked around those parts, be it the vengeful spirits of the family, or the stranger that seemed to wipe them off the face of the earth. I passed the castle just before the gate to Rubha, its remains naught now but bare bones. It felt like staring at a corpse. I shuddered, and then moved along.
	
Though the winds were no less ferocious, nor the rain more forgiving, the view that greeted me when I reached the top was something unreal. The sea stretched on for what looked like forever, the sun bright in the sky and breaking through angry clouds. The bothy stood daintily against the wild scenery behind it, and the rawness of the scene, for some strange reason, made me want to weep. I walked past the bothy, dropping my bag off in a covered corner to prevent it getting soaked any further, and let my feet carry me as close to the edge of the cliff as I dared. The sea roared below me, its violent waves like sirens seeming to draw me closer. Instead, I let my tired legs carefully lower me to the ground, and I laid down on my back, taking in the rush of everything around me. 
	
I was grinning madly at the shape of the clouds in the sky, observing the space where the soft grey transitions into a mad noir, when a gruff voice yelled over the wind. 
	
“ARE YOU QUITE WELL, MISSUS?”
	
I tilted my head to face the voice. The foggy, sideways image of him made no sense to me, so I righted myself and tried to clear the rain out of my eyes to look at him clearly. Upright, he still made very little sense. Though they were partly hidden beneath his flatcap, I could see his eyes, the lids of them dry and red as though he had been rubbing them for quite some time. He wore something closer to hunting than hiking gear, but not that of deer hunters you find occasionally in the Cairngorms. No, this man was dressed in a neat plaid shirt under a heavy, green jacket, the expensive looking kind. His leather shoes, bewilderingly, were still shining, the sparse sun gleaming off them like diamonds. In fact, there didn’t seem to be a speck of dirt nor damp on him even though he was standing in the same rain as me. I almost felt underdressed.

I looked at him and I just knew, this is a man who hunts foxes. I could envision him sitting atop a horse, high and mighty, looking for meek prey amidst the trees. 

“Yeah,” I shouted back, “Just admiring the-”

“WHA?” He yelled. I clear my throat and speak up against the wind.

“JUST ADMIRING THE VIEW!” 

“AH,” he articulated, scratching his white beard, “WELL, SURELY YOU CAN DO THAT INSIDE? FROM THE WINDOWS?” He turned around, gesturing wildly to the bothy as he stumbled towards it. It was clear that not following him inside wasn’t really an option - it was four in the afternoon by this point and the weather wasn’t getting any better. 

The bothy was packed with people to the point where when I pushed the door open, I knocked some poor bloke on the head who had apparently chosen the hallway as his place of rest for the evening. He awkwardly shuffled out of the way in order to let me in, glaring at me over his copy of The Imaginative World of the Reformation. 

To my left was, what would be in a normal situation, a two person bedroom with a bunk bed. On the top sat a young couple chatting over cups of coffee. The bottom bunk was clearly claimed by a canvas bag, which I figured belonged to the Foxhunter given the union jack sewed onto it. The rest of the floor was left unseen by the sleeping bags of a gaggle of Italian hikers huddled over a game of cards, oblivious to my presence. The room on the right, what would have acted as an old Lookout, was much the same, though the rest of the tenants had abandoned their sleeping spots instead to sit by the massive window, watching the already biblical storm grow worse by the minute. A few turned around to smile and say hello.

I stumbled my way into an as yet unclaimed corner of the room to finally set down my things. I had a clear view of the hallway from where I was sitting, and I saw the Foxhunter was still watching me, stood by the doorframe. 

“Seems you and I are the only Brits here,” he said, “We ought to stick together.”  

I awkwardly smiled at him. I thought of his fancy accent, how the vowels seemed to stretch large enough to swallow you whole, thought of his hunting coat and his uncanny tidiness, and I could not think we were less alike. We were in this for the long run though, and there was no point in not humouring him. 

You know, I never noticed until I started to tell people this story, but for the life of me, I cannot remember the Foxhunter’s name. Perhaps it was blown away in the wind when we first met. Perhaps he had already told the other tenants and had simply forgotten to bring it up again. I mean, it's not like I asked, either. But telling it now, it feels strange to be unable to place a proper name to the figure who spent the large majority of that evening looming over me from the hallway door, always just a little too close for comfort, but not close enough for me to have a right to be outwardly upset about it. If I had tried to stand up, he would be but inches away from my face. I felt cornered, but not enough to ask him to step back, to offend him or come off as rude or any number of other reasons to make this man I would be sleeping a few feet away from angry with me.  

All I could do was sit and smile and nod, listening to the Foxhunter disrupt and divert every single conversation for the rest of the night. No matter the situation, he always had some sort of anecdote. He was an expert in just about everything, from hiking through the alps to studying politics at university to the road laws in the UK in comparison to mainland Europe. 

And Scotland? He was certainly an expert on Scotland. 

It was eight by this point and most of us were tucked into our sleeping bags, chatting over cups of tea or hot chocolate, all opposed to the Foxhunter, smoking a fat cigar that he insisted he couldn't smoke outside, the ash of it falling onto my sleeping bag from where he was still hovering over me. 

""You know,” started one of the Italian girls after a moment of silence, “The whole time we've been here, we've hardly heard anyone speak the Scottish language.” 

“Ah,” the Foxhunter cut in, “That would be Celtic. It's a dead language. For the better, to be honest.” 

“How so?” She asked, brow furrowed.

“Well, I'm sure you've heard the accent at the very least while you've been here. The Scots are so harshly spoken. A couple schools still teach Celtic, but frankly, I think it's a waste of taxpayer money. What's the point in teaching children such a useless skill? The language as a whole is just pointless. It's barbaric. That's the Highlands right the way down, frankly.” 

Some of the tenants ignored this rant, some shot bewildered looks between each other, but infuriatingly, I watched a few stranglers lean towards the Foxhunter, eyes wide and curious like children before a teacher, waiting patiently for the gruesome details. A small grin grew on the Foxhunter’s face. 

“The Highland clans were a particular kind of evil. They invaded English settlements in the middle of the night, stealing the livestock, burning down homes, killing men, women, children, entire bloodlines lost in an instant. It was a bleak period of English history. Savages. All of them, savages-”

“What about what England did to the Scots?”

It was the first time I’d spoken in hours, barely able to get a word in edge wise with the Foxhunter and his ramblings. The tenants looked at me with curious eyes. I craned my neck up to see the Foxhunter only to find him staring, wide and blank at me. I felt myself begin to sweat a little. 

“What about the English?” He asked, an unnerving softness to his voice. 

I swallowed. “I mean, the Scots were invading their own land that the English had occupied. That livestock belonged to them before the Army stole them. The Scots may have attacked villages, but the King and his Army tried to exterminate the Scottish people entirely.”

I looked to the listening tenants, “The English language wasn't simply a nicer sounding option than Gàidhlig, it pillaged and raped its way through Scotland until Gàidhlig was eventually illegalized. That is the reason you do not hear it anymore. The fact that there are schools that are able to teach it today is a miracle.”

The room is quiet for a little while, only for the rain hitting the windows. Eventually, the Italian girl giggled awkwardly, “Well, we best be careful not to cross you rowdy Highlanders.” The other tenants laughed with her, moving on to sharing their own experiences of the locals on Skye. 

I wasn’t laughing. Neither was the Foxhunter. Instead, he looked down at me intently. I'll never forget what he said.  

“Did you drive here?” 

I did. Of course I did. I must have mentioned it earlier. He must have seen my car keys, attached by a clip at my waist. I clutch them just to be sure. Calm. I am calm. 

“Yes.” I answer weakly. 

“When are you travelling home tomorrow?”

Early. As early as possible. The moment the sun tries to break through that storm, I'm gone. “I don’t know. Noonish, maybe.” 

“I need a lift. I hitchhiked my way out here. I'm headed North. You could take me with you, yes?” 

I felt on the verge of tears. I could do nothing but pointlessly open and shut my mouth like some stupid fish, hoping for words which refused to come. 

It's the kind of question designed so that you can’t exactly say no.

“Just let me know by the morning,’ he declared, smiling mirthlessly at me. With that, he finally, finally let me be and clambered into his sleeping bag. 

At that point, I took some time to think of the logistics of trying to hike down the hill right then and there, of making it to my car, and begging the nearest hotel to take me in. I didn't care if they didn't have a room, I was prepared to sleep on their lobby floor so long as it put a locked door between me and this man. 

Instead, I zipped up my sleeping bag, still in my hiking gear, and figured I'd hunker down for a few hours before sneaking out. Worst case scenario, I figured, at least I was surrounded by other people. There should have been at least some sense of security that came with that. 

The next part is still a blur to me, but if I remember correctly, it goes something like this. 

I woke to a strange sound. Something like a small wood saw. No that wasn't right, something was being cut, but it wasn’t wood. Snip, snip. That's what I’m hearing. Someone is cutting something, clumsily at that, the sound interrupted by bouts of wet, ragged breath.

My eyes opened, just a little at first, catching the bright moonlight that was shining diligently through the pitch black clouds outside. I followed the path of the light, the light reflecting brightly in the Foxhunter’s glassy, dead eyes, reflecting brightly off the small hunting knife he was using to cut open the bottom of my sleeping bag. Dirty hands pulled at the seams he had torn. I could feel his heavy, rancid breath settling over my face.

It smells like blood. Ancient mud and flesh and fire and bone and oh, so much blood. He smells like he has devoured history. His jaw is hung wider than anything I've ever seen. 

I didn’t think. I didn’t even scream. I just forced my knees into the Foxhunter’s gluttonous jaw as hard as possible, forcing him to fall on top of the sleeper opposite me, and fought with the zipper of my sleeping bag until I was out. Then I was running. I stomped unthinking on top of the man sleeping by the door, throwing the door open and sprinting out into the dark in my socked feet, faster than I ever thought I could. I wasn't really running, in hindsight, it felt more like falling, falling very fast through the air. Right the way down, my shins slammed into boulders and my ankles began to fail me after one too many hard falls, feet stuck in the possessive mud of the hill. At one point, I stumbled into a shallow ditch and managed to lose a few nails clawing myself out of the sludge.

Despite all this, the pain was gone from me. I just kept running until I was hurtling towards my car, hands shaking as I clumsily unlocked the door. Even then, I didn't stop. I started the Fiat and crushed my battered foot into the accelerator, driving thirty over the limit until I found society once more. I stumbled towards the first house I saw, and when its inhabitants came to the door, asked frantically for someone to call an ambulance. 

When I woke next, I was at Broadford hospital with nothing but the clothes on my back, two broken ankles, and the tear stricken face of my terrified, yet very, very angry mother looking down at me. She certainly knows just how sorry I am for running away.  

Sense memory is a funny thing. In one version of events, I can clearly hear that ragged breathing following me down the hill, the stomp of boots slamming into mud just at my heels. In another, there is nothing but the wind blowing past my ears. If I had paid more attention to my surroundings, I wonder if I would have noticed the uncanny silence of the lookout before I ran, that the person the Foxhunter fell on top of never made a noise, or that the man I trampled by the door made no sound of protest but a dull, wet squelch as my foot sank into the spot where his torso should have been. I would have noticed the blood which covered the bothy floor, covered the Foxhunter’s mouth. 

If, out of the corner of my eye, there really had been something more than a man on the mountain, some awful, bloated thing that seemed to stretch out for miles, for years, I couldn't say with any certainty.

I never became a med student. The sight of blood, something I had once considered myself relatively brave to, now turns me into a hyperventilating mess. I saw a therapist for some time, thinking that maybe if I could process what happened, I could get on with my life, but without any real closure, I’ve had little success. I don’t know what happened to me that night and I don't think I ever will. I couldn't tell you what I really saw. Maybe it was nothing at all, some bad dream born from a moment's madness. 

What I believe, however, is that whatever children are taught about the wars in Scotland and the old English Colonizer, it is dead wrong. Those outfits you donned as a child, preparing to march into battle under the watchful eye of your teacher’s camera, it was all a lie. In the depths of history, hidden under a red coat and a long sword, there is something beyond human understanding, something beyond man entirely. Something infinitely hungrier.

Went from reactions to stories to a friendship. I've been flaking on getting coffee with them for the first time for a few weeks now after they expressed romantic interest a few times, despite me not returning that interest and sharing it plainly. 

Recently, I have about a week sober but am doing badly with my mental health. My sleep cycle is fucked and I'm really depressed. I've shared with this person about how I've been struggling since I relapsed a couple months ago and was even honest about how badly I'd been doing this past week. 

They pushed for coffee again and I suggested we get a late dinner instead, and they were like. ""Yeah, we can get a few drinks too."" And I got immediately pissed off. Have they not been listening? Is their desire to turn this into a romantic connection so much that they're going for a boozy bent on the meet? I feel so dismissed and unheard and angry and I stopped replying after saying they could drink but I wouldn't, and reminding them I'm trying to stop.

1o6vbf8,https://www.reddit.com/r/vending/comments/1o6vbf8/finding_locations/,Finding Locations,"This is asked and mentioned alot, on facebook and reddit.

This post is just going to be an overview of how you can actually understand how locations are found. I am going to be showing this from a perspective of my area, which is Reno NV, and how a corporate sales department would go about this. I am not going to go into what you need to do prior, such as obtaining a license and insurance, we will assume you have those.

Step 1:

Understand what services you can offer. There’s no such thing as the “vending industry”, this is just a term. “Concession” and or “convenience solutions” and lastly “automated retail” is the purviews we generally fall under in the legal sense. Canteen/Sodexo provide Vending machines, Micro-Markets, Water dispensers, Ice machines, Coffee equipment, and essentially anything you would find in a breakroom, they will provide.

Most folks are just thinking of vending machines, the heaviest objects out of them all. Corporate entities like FootLocker, Sherwin Williams, Amazon, Caterpillar, like big business in general, does not want to do business with multiple vendors for similar services. So those contracts revolve around the vendor meeting everything they need serviced which will commonly be vending, water and coffee. 

As others have said, you do not buy vending machines before getting locations unless you are flipping them and know what you are doing overall. Same goes for coffee and water. Those machines are often cheaper than vending machines additionally and have plenty of online sources to order from.


Step 2:

When you know what you can offer, you need to then create zones/areas within your larger service area that you want to focus on first. Go onto Google Maps and determine how far you are willing to drive for a maximum distance from your starting point. You want to ideally always stay close but thats not possible for everyone. You want to look for industrial areas and business areas. In Reno, we have multiple zones filled with warehouses and various industries that have 100+ employees per building. You can type in “USA Parkway, NV” on Google Maps to see how far an industrial zone can go out from a city, you want to concentrate on areas that are like this initially as they are easy to focus on. Simply going to Google Maps and zooming out a little bit, you can search the word “industrial” and zoom in on pins that appear as they are likely to be near other warehouses. Once you find an area within a reasonable distance that has alot of warehouses grouped together, you can click each individual building and even if there is no marker for the building, still click on it on google maps as it can potentially find further details about the coordinates.


Step 3: 

start saving businesses to a list. On Google Maps you can create a “list” and name it whatever you want. You want to first find your area of warehouses, once you have, switch between sattelite view and street view. You can count cars in parking lots, big warehouses with alot of cars can be assumed to be good locations. Places that look semi big but theres no cars in the parking lot, still save them as they may have been closed when the images were taken. Street view gives you a different perspective from the google cars and those are likely to contain some cars in parking lots to count. The whole point of this is to get an idea of how many people are inside of the buildings. You always assume 1 person per car, dont overthink this.

This is an example of San Diego list i have made for someone. This is a real example but i have not completed it intentionally:

https://maps.app.goo.gl/gkDYdFNSpKHKMwGFA

You can review types of businesses i selected. Those businesses are based on Vending, Water, and coffee services. So not every location is viable for a vending machine but is for either coffee/water. Now you will notice alot of schools, i will explain government/school stuff way later. For now, you want to build potential lists of companies you will reach out to and try to become a vendor for.


Step 4:

Once you have a list, you know what equipment you can obtain for coffee/water/vending/micromarkets, you need to figure out who you need to talk to at a business. Small businesses will often be the owner/highest authority for the business. Larger businesses that have structure that goes beyond their location, it could be 1-2-3, which means it could be the highest ranking individual at the facility, the 2nd in command, and or even the 3rd in command. There is often more than 1 person involved in this decision making, larger businesses will have a ranking manager be the decision to say yes/no but then someone underneath them will be the point of contact for managing the account. So the thing is, whom the person you need to talk to per business will be different in title super often. It’s not the front desk worker, it’s not the first person that picks up the phone when you call their customer line.

So this is where alot of folks fail. Googlin is easy, figuring out who you need to talk to is where things go sideways often. How you figure this out, we could spend weeks on the topic overall but one example of a “strategy” is to call the business customer line that you would find on their website or google maps. Call it and when someone asks how they can help you, ask them “hello, my name is Hunter with AIOV and my apologies as i meant to call sooner, i am unaware of their name but they handle accounts for vendors, are they available right now?” And pay attention to what they say, if they ask “what do you do or offer?” You can respond similarly with “oh my bad, we offer convenience services and just wanted to make sure everything was covered.” 

Do not directly say vending machines. Right now theres like 300 people in Dallas alone running around trying to figure this business out and the “industry” as a whole has become a nuisance in some cases in areas. You want to be professional and being professional in the USA means dancing with words, not direct to the point nervousness.


Step 4.5: 

Again, you can use google to your advantage in many ways. Google Maps lets you have a satellite view and street view, take advantage and inspect buildings outsides by counting cars and trying to guesstimate how many people are hanging out sacrificing their life for the almighty dollar in those buildings. There are websites that have data on businesses, they may not have all of the data but you can take the name of a business and perform further research on Google Search. You can also find managers and better contact information through google, linkedin, the company’s “about/team” page, and even job postings (titles tell you who owns facilities/operations/office stuff). Worst case, call the main line and ask who handles “convenience services for the breakroom” at the site. Don’t over explain, don’t sell on that call, just get the name, title, and email. Save it to your list. Additionally you do not want to call a front desk for a name and then an hour later call the individual you need to talk to, smaller businesses the employees talk and you can potentially be looked at as a nuisance, wait a couple days and follow back up.

What does following up actually mean though?

So let’s say we found a potential business with 100+ employees on site for 3 shifts/24.7. And it is a local business and not corporate owned.

First we will do a google search on the business name with a search such as this:

- BusinessName facility manager site:linkedin.com

So this would then force Google to do a search on linkedin and only display results for linkedin. So we can think click through a couple of these and get an idea of the type of people working at the location, we can figure out whos who in management often just through linkedin. Once we find some names, we can go a step further but what i am about to say is something that is nearly impossible to avoid in the technologically dominated world we live in.

Once we have names, there are websites such as the one below but also CRM platforms contain similar tools:

https://www.truepeoplesearch.com 

That lets you search a name and area for an individuals data. Often emails and personal contact info is available in these profiles. We do not want personal emails nor anything personal, we need business emails but strictly speaking this is unethical and whether you do this, thats your discretion. This is happening in many sales departments for many industries across the country.

Expanding further on the Google Searches, you want to find job titles for businesses that are like these:

Facilities Manager / Director of Facilities
Operations Manager / Director of Operations
Plant Manager / Site Manager / General Manager
Office Manager / Workplace/Facilities Coordinator
HR Manager / People Ops Manager (often owns perks/amenities in offices)
Procurement / Purchasing Manager (contracts, vendor onboarding)
Property/Building Manager (multi-tenant buildings)

You can do google searches such as:

- ""BusinessName"" AND (facilities OR operations OR plant OR office) manager site:linkedin.com
- site:linkedin.com/in ""BusinessName"" (facilities OR operations OR plant OR office) manager
- ""convenience services"" OR ""breakroom"" ""BusinessName"" site:linkedin.com/in
- site:businessdomain.com (facilities OR operations OR ""workplace"" OR ""office manager"" OR procurement)
- site:linkedin.com/in ""BusinessName"" (""Facilities Manager"" OR ""Director of Facilities"")
- site:linkedin.com/in ""BusinessName"" (""Operations Manager"" OR ""Director of Operations"")
- site:linkedin.com/in ""BusinessName"" (""Plant Manager"" OR ""Site Manager"" OR ""General Manager"")
- site:linkedin.com/in ""BusinessName"" (""Facilities"" OR ""Operations"") ""YOUR-CITY""


Replace the BusinessName with the name of the business you are searching and YOUR-CITY with your area. You want to use these to help you get an understanding of the management of the business, you may not find the person you need to talk to but you want to have a manager as the person you plan to contact. Even if the manager isn't a decision maker, they are likely to know who is the decision maker and can get direct communication to them alot easier in some cases than front office workers and communications workers on the phone.

Now let's say you have information of a manager you want to contact, either you have a phone number or email, if you cannot find one that is fine but you need a name. If you do not have a phone/email, you will need to call the front desk or go in and speak with the front desk, how you approach them, your appearance will matter alot. Do not go in without looking like a representative of a company. Businesses do not want to have a random individual operating out of their garage trying to provide service to 50+ employees or really any size, it's risky and the potential stress is too much for most businesses to risk. So you want to look like you are a representative of a business, this isn't lying but you can provide the appearance that you are more than just a random person through your clothing and demeanor, how you speak. The thing is, it is easy for anyone to get cleaned up and looking ""professional"", so when you walk through the door and they see you, the assumption is you are someone well put together and not a hot mess, someone that takes care of their appearance will surely take care of their business right? not really but anyways the appearance is the first thing you are judged upon if you are doing a walk in. If you are emailing, how you format the email, the verbiage you use, how you portray yourself is the representation of the business. Poorly typed and rambling messes like what this post has been will not fly in most cases for larger clients. Your words are what gives you appearance when it comes to dealing with everything online. Luckily ChatGPT exists and you are more than able to utilize that but do beware that there's sentiment rising of people disliking AI generated responses, be a human but be reliable, provide a quality service and life will be successful. 


When you go to walk in, you can start with something along the lines of ""Hey there! My name is Hunter, my bad as I was going to come in tomorrow but luckily I was in the area today. I was wondering if FirstName LastName is in and available? I am with AIOV and just wanted to make sure they got dropped off this gift."" And that's when you flash a gold-plated, custom machined vending machine that weighs a minimum of 56oz of 24k gold that has the company name lasered into it. They cannot say no to this. Inside of the mini gold vending machine you want to have a pamphlet/brochure that looks professional and modern that showcases services you offer and upselling strategies. Going back to Step 1, determining which equipment you can offer, if you feel as if the location would be a great location for a Vending machine or micro-market, you want to avoid commissions or mentioning the term at all until it's the last resort. You can actually offer Coffee machines and cheap/free coffee instead of commissions. You can offer yearly Pizza parties, bbq catering, ice cream parties, you can be as creative as you want with this. Some locations can be very profitable, so providing $1000 worth of pizza parties to the employees can be super cost effective for getting locations without coughing up commission. The thing is, there's alot of foolery going on when salespeople are talking with clients. We do not want to cough up money that can go into our pockets, if they want commission then they can install and maintain the machines themselves is how alot of people feel. So we want to present ourselves as a reliable, quality service that has several service offerings. Doing walk-ins, we realistically want to talk to the manager and let them know ""hey, we are now doing business in your area, we can beat the competitors on pricing, on product selection, on reliability, on quality overall."" 


This has been alot of rambling. There's alot of information still to be learned, but the biggest things are that you research your competitors in your area, read all of their reviews on Google/Yelp/Everywhere and try to understand their shortcomings. Use their failures as ammo for when you go to speak with locations, you can ensure that you do not fall short of anything. You do not need to buy any equipment, you can make brochures that have images of equipment that you do not have in your physical possession, what matters is being able to source it. Once communications start with a company, it's not an instant install, the install date can be a few days later or even a few months. Often 3-6 weeks from the day the equipment is chosen and contract has been signed will equipment be installed. So you merely need to have a list of businesses/sources you can get the equipment for so that when the day comes, you can order them and have them shipped. Only offering vending machines will always be a bit harder to get into big locations with, simply because corporate entities and large businesses just do not want to have many vendors to work with, it's more fiscally sound to have a singular source managing as much as possible and able to provide further services. You preparing and offering the same/near similar will always let you offer different angles. There is no ""pitch"" that is going to work for every location and we do not recommend anyone following one, you need to be comfortable and simply let folks know your services, let them know you are educated and knowledgeable on your equipment, let them know you can fix the machines and you provide product suggestions and always offer refunds, let them know you respond quickly to any communications and emergencies, be reliable and offer a quality service. I have repeated the quality aspect several times now and the reason being is that people have provided such a poor level of service over the years that now it is common for vending operators to be thought of as unreliable.

Fast forward to now.. I had a focal seizure today that came with a pounding migraine for the past two days, plus some accidents that I couldn’t control (peeing myself) I didn’t think much of it because when that happens I usually have my seizures almost instantly BUT it just felt like a bad migraine, which comes pre and post seizures at times. 

He seems to get more frustrated with me than ever and it’s really putting me into a depression. I try to explain that because of my seizures especially having them in my frontal lobe, my memory, motor skills, etc are affected. It can cause short and long term damage and I try my fucking best every single damn day, while also being a mother to my daughter, and his two sons. 

I feel absolutely defeated and don’t know how to talk to him about these things. For example I had a seizure today - he then comes home and asks what’s the plan for dinner - like I even had time to think about that or care for that matter. Then I asked him to drive me to the pharmacy to get my meds and I didn’t to get a few things, he said no problem, we go to the store and then we get home and he asked if I got milk - no I didn’t get it because I grabbed a case of water and whatever you put on the list to make your homemade jerky, his response “we drink coffee every morning you didn’t know we needed milk”. NO I DIDN’T. Because that cup of coffee we drink at 7am isn’t on my mind at 5-6pm. I try to write everything down so I don’t forget. But it’s not what he says, it’s HOW he says it. And have brought up many times. Then he proceeds to tell me to stop pouting cause he’s going through these things with me.. but living with it and living with someone who has it are two completely different things. I feel like I never do or am enough. 

I just feel defeated all around and having a seizure makes me feel like I set myself back. I’m frustrated, stressed, dealing with working a full time job, on top of things going at my daughter’s school that I’m trying to handle. I just .. I don’t know anymore. ",1,1760484445.0,Epilepsy,4,1.0,False

This small change helped me sleep again,"# I used to believe that getting up multiple times during the night to urinate was a normal aspect of growing older.

I would sleep for a few hours, wake up, use the restroom, and then lie awake for what seemed like an eternity. It started out slowly but gradually got worse.



I tried cutting back on coffee and water, and I even took some pills, but nothing really helped.

Making minor adjustments rather than major ones and concentrating on the cause of the issue were what ultimately helped.



For a week, I kept a record of everything, including how late I went to bed, what I ate for dinner, when I drank water, and how active I was in the evening.

From there, I created a straightforward seven-day plan with tiny, doable changes that gradually had a significant impact.

Now I sleep about 6–7 hours straight most nights, no medication, no strict rules.  
I also made a small tracker that helps keep the routine on track.

It’s a bit too long to explain everything here, so I wrote it all down — the habits, the plan, and the tracker — in one place.

1o6v62n,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o6v62n,Oda already confirmed that sanji will get conquerors haki,"I’m honestly shocked by how some people are ignoring this. Like, seriously, just look at the panel. Gaban literally says it seems like there’s more than one Conqueror’s Haki user. Both Zoro and Sanji react to it, but here’s the thing: Gaban already knows that one of them has Conqueror’s Haki because He literally fought Zoro in the castle, and Zoro was overflowing with it (image 2).

And not only that even the biggest idiot, a.k.a. Luffy, noticed it the whole time (image 3).

So you’re telling me that the guy with advanced Observation Haki, the same guy who sensed Shamrock and Gunko spawning in Elbaf even though they supressed their haki, who knew where Sommers, Gillingham, and Gunko were, could locate them and even count how many there were, bro you’re telling me that guy only just now realized Zoro has Conqueror’s Haki? Even though he literally had a coffee and cake chat with him, Luffy, and Nami in the castle before?

Come on. If that’s the case, then Gaban’s Observation is worse than my great uncle’s and he’s got dementia, which is hard to top.

It’s obvious Gaban was referring to Sanji. I really don’t get why people are still debating this. Its clear that bros Conquerors Haki is dormant but gaban with his boss level Observation skills can still sense it. 

The question isn’t if he’ll awaken it anymore, it’s how he’ll awaken it.

I experienced a panic attack after eating my food. While laying down I felt like my heart just felt weird and strange. But I all hyperventilated while eating 

And I’ve been having shortness of breath every time I ate + this burning sensation like . Dizziness and loss of balance 

(I have to add that 2 weeks prior to this day I had eaten an aunt anniepretzel and felt ill for 1 week with constant dizziness)

(I also took 1 bimzelx shot the day before this tragedy)

I went to do endoscopy and found Mild Chronic Gastritis with flamed esophagus. And gurd.
However my anxiety was super bad and I was sensitive to noise , like I would flinch.

Till they put me on PPI and low acid food 

Anyways September..
No more dizziness and Bloating , and this feeling burning all in my head . All this except my anxiety and shortness of breath on the regular . Not while eating anymore .

1o6uww2,https://i.redd.it/9fhgj6get5vf1.jpeg,Philly Art: Dame La Receta! – Blurring the Lines Between Authenticity and Performity,"Dame La Receta! served as more than a thought-provoking dance performance. From the costumes to the coffee that was brewed on stage, it was a completely immersive experience that intrigued all of the senses. Thematically, this piece showcases the joys of traditions and the challenges of acculturation in the lives of immigrants in America (specifically Afro-Cuban immigrants).

This piece was a commentary on the “American Dream”, a promise easily made but not so easily kept. The storytelling elements of this performance were strong and effective. We started the show with a pledge of allegiance that started as devotion but ended with cynicism. Dancers’ hands slowly fell from their hearts and their voices rose out of frustration, exhaustion, and disappointment.

1o6uwkj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AI_Wayfarer_Resort/comments/1o6uwkj/the_jed_template_guide/,The JED template guide,"### You don't know how to create your first character card? Try JED!


The JED template is a very versatile template for creating character cards. It's not our own method, it's from the SillyTavern community, and we just adapt it to our needs.

**IMPORTANT**

- This is **not** a required format. It is **one** of **many** possible ways to write a bot. **Never** blindly copy a template like this or the core structure of example bots you studied to learn.

- Think about what **your bot needs** and **adapt your chosen method**. Cut out parts of this template you don't need instead of mindlessly filling them with bloat. Better expand on other parts you consider more important for your bot. You can make up sections to add as well!


🪶  **Remember:** Our critics are always happy when someone thinks a lot about their bot. Don't be afraid to experiment, we love to see new ideas. Make sure to properly **test** your idea in case a critic has questions about your method.

Don't be scared of trying something new, **we won't mark errors as long as your idea works in a bot.** We want to see talented and ambitous botmakers. If you find and properly test a method that was never seen before in showcase, you will get high scores on our ""Creativity"" scale and are likely to become a budding partner soon!

### What is ""JED""?
JED stands for ""just enough definition."" The template is a bit like AWR's keyword-style long description, only with many more sections for you to fill with keywords and short sentences.
Before I come to the meat and bones of your bot, the definition, let's talk about the greeting and example messages. You can do them *mostly* as you did on c.ai, but you need to ⚠️  **__unlearn__** ⚠️ some things as well.

### Initial message / ""Greeting""
For cards, we don't have a format anymore. So forget about things like the (()) or the line break. Only describe your scenario, make it immersive and interesting, and don't forget to write about what your character is doing and saying.

**IMPORTANT**

**__Don't write anything for the user at all in your greeting.__**
- No ""You enter the coffee shop."" or something like this anymore. Write always from the character's point of view, like this:
> Character sees {{user}} enter the coffee shop.

or
> Character sees a new customer enter the coffee shop.

- With c.ai, we let it slide because it didn't have too much influence on the chat. With character cards, I noticed **the AI will be extremely likely to act and speak for the user** if you even include just a tiny sentence like the coffee shop example in your initial message. So, write absolutely nothing **for** the user. At most, your character may address them directly, like ""Hello, {{user}}.""

- Remember, the initial message is part of the ongoing chat and won't stay in the character's permanent memory. **__Don't include information here that you want the character to keep.__** If you need to introduce important world-building elements, make sure to include them also in your character's description (=""definition"") or a lorebook.


### Example Dialogues
On Silly Tavern, you have an extra input field for example messages. It's called ""Examples of dialogue"" and you can find it in the Advanced Definitions (the little book icon 📔  next to your character card in the interface). You write them as you did on c.ai. Start each part of your dialogue with {{user}}: and {{char}}: . Keep the messages from the user short and simple, you need only the barest minimum.

🪶  Put your creativity and writing skills into the {{char}} dialogues. **Don't** write just simple descriptions of your character's expression or body language. Even c.ai did this well enough with empty bots. The example dialogues exist to show the AI which **writing style** you prefer and to establish the **speech pattern** of your character. So for interesting, varied answers, you need to put the same into your example dialogues.

Describe the **not-so-obvious** things. Think not only about your character but also the surroundings in your example scenes.

👀 Don't write only visual impressions, maybe there are sounds or a smell. What does your character feel? Not only their emotions, what do they physically feel? 🫴 Maybe the comforting warmth of a nearby campfire or a cold, chilling wind. Think about all five senses when creating an example scene. It pays off, the AI will pick up your writing pattern and include many more interesting descriptions in the answers.

Or let your character interact with items and their surroundings. Let them move around, use stuff, or show off their powers. There's a reason why we call the descriptive parts in a dialogue ""action."" Show us some action, then your character will do more interesting things in its answers as well. 🪄 

**IMPORTANT**

- Don't write essential information **only** into your example messages. This is one of the c.ai habits you have to **__unlearn.__** In c.ai, this was good practice, because the example messages shared the definition with a bot. Also, the space was extremely limited, so you had to make the best of it.

- In Silly Tavern, most people choose to place the example messages in the dedicated ""dialogues"" field. This field **isn't permanent memory** like the c.ai definition was! Users have the option in the SillyTavern interface to push example messages out of the bot's memory when it gets filled up with the ongoing chat. When they do this, **the bot will forget the content of your example dialogues.**

- So to be on the safe side, you need to establish essential information in the bot's permanent memory, the ""Description"" field (it's like c.ai's ""definition""). Use the example messages only to establish writing styles and speech patterns.


Also, we don't need an END_OF_DIALOG line anymore. You only need to state where an example scene begins. You do it like this:
> <START>

> {{user}}:

> {{char}}:

> {{user}}:

> {{char}}:

> <START>

> {{user}}:

> {{char}}:

...and so on.


### ""Definition""/Description
The JED format has a nice template that you can fill with information about your character. It follows in the next comment. Copy it and paste it into your interface, or download the template card in our Discord server. https://discord.gg/VnTEPPgREp


Keep in mind: **We don't have a strict format anymore for cards,** this also counts for this template! If you choose to skip the format of this template, that's fine. Just keep it consistent.

You don't have to fill out each of the provided sections. Delete those you don't need. Please don't fill them with meaningless, boring stuff if you can't think of anything interesting that would add to your character.

Also, you can create your own sections as well. It's fun to experiment and see what the AI will make out of your ideas!

Have fun writing your characters!

1o6uvy1,https://youtu.be/gReZ0tTVtJM,4 Very Scary TRUE Remote Backroad Breakdown Horror Stories,"# ""Locked in the Cab"":

I was on my way home after spending the weekend with family, driving down Interstate 24 near the Kentucky–Tennessee line. The sky was bruised with the color of early dusk, and the road stretched endlessly ahead—just me, the hum of the tires, and the low hiss of wind through the cracked window. My old sedan had been giving me trouble for weeks, but I convinced myself it would make it just one more trip.

Then the sputtering started. A weak cough from the engine, a flicker in the gauges, and a sinking realization—I had pushed the fuel tank too far. The car shuddered once, twice, then went silent. I coasted to the shoulder, the hazard lights weakly blinking against the blur of speeding headlights.

My phone was dead. No charger, no signal of help. I sat there for a long minute, gripping the steering wheel, hoping maybe someone might pull over. But every car roared past, their taillights smearing red lines through the dusk.

Then, in my rearview mirror, I saw a semi-truck slowing down. It did a wide, deliberate U-turn across the median and rumbled up behind me, brakes hissing. A heavy-set man climbed down from the cab. He looked to be in his fifties, his face rough but smiling, a hint of warmth in his eyes.

“You alright, ma’am?” he asked, his voice booming over the wind. “Looks like you ran out of gas.”

“Yeah,” I admitted. “My phone’s dead too.”

He nodded. “Well, there’s a station about ten miles ahead. I can take you there, help you get a can of fuel. Name’s Ray.”

He seemed kind, maybe a bit rough around the edges, but genuine. I hesitated, my instincts prickling, but with no other cars stopping and the night coming fast, I decided to trust him. I locked my car, climbed up into the passenger seat of his truck, and we started down the interstate.

At first, everything felt fine. Ray talked a lot—about the long hours on the road, how he had two grown kids about my age, and how he’d been driving for over twenty years. I nodded along, half-listening, grateful just to be moving again.

But when the sign for the gas station appeared—our supposed stop—he didn’t slow down. He just kept driving.

“Hey,” I said, pointing to the exit. “That was it.”

He didn’t answer. His face had gone flat, the friendliness gone from his voice. I tried again, louder this time. “Ray, that was the gas station.”

That’s when he reached under his seat and pulled out a small pistol.

“Don’t scream,” he said calmly, almost too calmly. “This is a kidnapping. You’re gonna do what I say.”

The words froze me. My chest tightened. I couldn’t process them at first, as if he’d spoken another language.

He pointed the gun at me and motioned toward the back of the cab. “Get in the sleeper. Now.”

My body moved before my mind could catch up. I climbed into the cramped space behind the seats—the small, dim area where truckers rest on long hauls. It smelled of sweat, diesel, and stale coffee.

He followed, closing the curtain behind him. From a drawer, he pulled out a pair of handcuffs and snapped them onto my wrists, the cold metal biting into my skin. He yanked a blanket over me and went back to the driver’s seat, starting the truck again.

I lay there trembling, every breath shallow and fast, the hum of the road vibrating through the mattress. I thought of my two little girls waiting at home, of how they’d ask where I was when I didn’t show up. I thought of the army—of the training, the strength I used to believe I had—and wondered if it would matter now.

After what felt like hours, I found my voice. “Are you going to kill me?” I asked.

His reply came quiet but cold. “No. Just rape you.”

I bit down hard on the inside of my cheek to keep from crying. “How long are you keeping me?”

“A few days,” he said. “Till I’m done.”

The truck stopped once on a desolate stretch of road. He came into the back again, lifted the blanket, and stared at me. I kicked out instinctively, my heel connecting with his arm. He cursed, swung the butt of the gun, and struck me in the side of the head. Stars burst behind my eyes. Warm blood trickled down my temple.

He grabbed a paper towel and wiped it roughly, muttering, “Don’t make this harder than it needs to be.” Then he tossed the blanket back over me and kept driving.

The pain pulsed, but under it, something else rose—anger. I flexed my hands, twisting them against the cuffs. The metal cut into my skin, but I kept pulling, again and again, until finally one wrist slipped free, skin torn and raw.

I waited. The truck rolled on in a slow rhythm, his attention on the road. Then I moved.

I lunged forward, throwing the blanket over his head, wrapping my arm around his neck from behind. He shouted and jerked the wheel, the truck swerving across lanes, horns blaring from passing cars.

“Stop it!” he yelled, gasping. “I’ll let you go! Just stop!”

I didn’t believe him, not for a second. I held on until he pulled over, the truck screeching to a halt on the shoulder.

He was shaking when he turned to me. “I never expected you to fight like that,” he said. “No one ever has.”

That one line chilled me more than anything else—because it meant I wasn’t the first.

The moment he unlocked the other cuff, I bolted. I hit the ground running, barefoot, bleeding, half my dress torn away, and sprinted down the shoulder waving my arms at oncoming cars.

A small silver sedan stopped. A woman jumped out and rushed to me. “Oh my God—are you okay?” she asked.

I could barely speak. “Call the police,” I whispered. “He has a gun.”

They caught him an hour later at a rest stop. His truck was filled with restraints, knives, and things I’ll never forget seeing listed in the police report.

Ray died in prison before the trial began. Maybe justice never fully came—but I lived. I went home. I held my girls. And that’s more than he could ever take from me.





# ""Nowhere to Run"":

Peter and I had been on the road for weeks, carving our way through the endless red heart of Australia in our beat-up orange Kombi van. The outback stretched out in every direction—vast, sunburnt, and shimmering under a sky so wide it felt like it might swallow us whole. We’d left Alice Springs that afternoon, heading north for Darwin, the van humming lazily along the Stuart Highway. The air inside smelled faintly of dust, petrol, and the cheap coffee we’d brewed that morning.

Peter was at the wheel, as always, his sunglasses reflecting the sinking sun. I sat beside him, boots on the dash, a map spread across my knees even though we both knew there was only one road for hundreds of kilometers. We talked about what we’d do when we reached the Top End—camp on the beach maybe, buy a case of beer, and finally rest.

By dusk, the highway was deserted. The last hint of light bled out over the desert scrub, painting everything in bruised purples and orange. The radio had long since lost signal, and the silence settled in, thick and strange. I remember feeling small—like the whole world had pulled back and left us adrift in its center.

Then, just after seven-thirty, I noticed headlights behind us. A white truck, four-wheel drive, with a green canopy over the back—the kind locals used for everything from hauling gear to hunting. At first, I thought nothing of it. But it stayed behind us for a long while, then crept closer. Too close.

Peter checked the mirror. “What’s this bloke doing?” he muttered.

The truck’s driver suddenly waved his arm out the window, motioning for us to pull over.

“Maybe something’s wrong with the van,” I said, a flutter of unease starting in my chest. “Like a flat or something sparking.”

Peter hesitated, then eased onto the shoulder near Barrow Creek. The truck slowed and stopped ahead of us. The driver stepped out.

He was tall—towering, really—with a solid, broad frame. Long dark hair tied back, a thick moustache, a checkered shirt half untucked, and dusty boots that crunched on the gravel. Something about him made the hairs on my arms rise, though I couldn’t say why.

Peter got out to meet him while I stayed inside, watching. The man’s voice carried faintly over the hum of the idling van. “Hey mate, saw sparks from your exhaust. Could catch fire if you’re not careful.”

Peter nodded, easygoing as ever. “Thanks for that. Better check it out.”

They went to the rear of the van. “Jo, jump in and rev the engine when I say,” Peter called.

I slid into the driver’s seat, turned the key, and waited. The engine coughed to life. Then, a sound cut through the quiet—sharp, explosive, metallic. A single crack that seemed to echo forever.

My heart lurched. “Peter?” I called. No answer.

Footsteps crunched toward the driver’s side. The man appeared at the window, face blank, eyes cold. A silver handgun gleamed in his hand.

“Get out,” he said softly, almost politely.

My throat went dry. “Where’s Peter?”

“Out.” His tone didn’t change.

He yanked the door open and dragged me out by the arm, the smell of oil and dust thick in the air. He spun me around, pinning me against the van. Plastic ties cinched tight around my wrists until my fingers went numb.

“Don’t fight,” he muttered. “You’ll only make it worse.”

“Please,” I gasped. “Just tell me where he is.”

He didn’t answer. The world blurred through tears and adrenaline. The gun pressed into my ribs as he pushed me toward his truck. I caught sight of a dog in the cab—a dalmatian mix with its ears perked and tail still, watching silently.

He threw open the back canopy, reaching for tape. I twisted, kicked, bit at the air, desperate. He swore, trying to get control. The tape grazed my mouth—I bit it, ripped free, screaming his name, Peter’s name, anything.

“Stop it!” he barked, shoving me hard against the side of the truck. I stumbled, the ties cutting deeper into my skin. In the chaos, one of my ankles came loose.

He turned for just a second—just one—and I ran.

The world tilted, adrenaline flooding every nerve. I bolted into the scrub, the dry grass clawing at my legs. Behind me, his shout tore through the night. “You little—!” Then came the flashlight beam, cutting through branches, searching.

I threw myself under a bush, curling into the dirt. The light swept past, paused, then moved on. My chest heaved silently, breath shaking in and out.

He prowled nearby, his boots crunching slow and methodical. “I know you’re here,” he called. “Don’t make this harder.”

The dog barked again, distant now. I pressed my face into the earth, tasting sand and blood. He came so close I could smell him—sweat, oil, gunpowder. I didn’t move.

Finally, his footsteps faded. Then came a heavy dragging sound from where the van was parked… and a sickening thud. My stomach turned.

Moments later, the Kombi’s engine sputtered to life. I dared to lift my head. The headlights moved, weaving off the road into the scrub until they vanished. Silence returned, wide and empty.

Hours passed before I moved. My wrists burned raw. The night was alive with strange sounds—distant cries, the rustle of something unseen. Every snap of a twig sent panic crawling up my spine.

I worked the ties against a jagged rock until they gave way. My hands shook as I rubbed circulation back into my fingers.

Then, far off down the highway, a faint light. Headlights. A road train, its engines roaring like salvation.

I stumbled from the bush, barefoot, waving frantically. The truck slowed, brakes hissing, and two men inside stared wide-eyed.

“Help!” I cried, voice cracking. “He shot my boyfriend—please!”

They didn’t ask questions. They pulled me into the cab, wrapped me in a blanket, and turned the truck toward Barrow Creek.

At the roadhouse, they called the police. I sat trembling, covered in dirt and blood, trying to explain through chattering teeth.

When the officers arrived hours later, we drove back to the scene. There was blood—Peter’s blood—and our van hidden among the scrub, doors open. But no Peter. No man.

Days turned to weeks. The media swarmed, the questions relentless. Some doubted me. Said it didn’t make sense. Why didn’t I scream sooner? Why wasn’t there more evidence?

But I knew what I saw.

Months later, a break came. DNA from my shirt, from the cable ties, from the van’s gearstick—all matched one man: Bradley John Murdoch. He’d been in Alice Springs that very day, driving a white Toyota four-wheel drive with a green canopy. CCTV caught him at a service station just hours after the attack.

The trial in Darwin dragged for months. When I took the stand, I could feel every eye in that room on me. Murdoch sat there, expressionless, his stare like stone.

“That’s him,” I said. My voice didn’t shake this time. “That’s the man.”

The jury found him guilty—murder, abduction, assault. Life sentence. No parole for twenty-eight years.

But Peter’s body was never found.

Even now, years later, I still see that endless stretch of desert when I close my eyes. I still hear the echo of that single gunshot, still feel the dry wind whip across my face.

The outback doesn’t forget, but it doesn’t explain either. It just keeps its secrets—buried deep in the red earth.

And somewhere out there, under all that silence, Peter is still waiting.





# ""Ten Minutes Away"":

I had just finished a long, punishing shift at the warehouse—hauling boxes until my arms burned and my back felt like it might snap. The clock had slipped past midnight by the time I climbed into my old pickup truck and started the drive home. The air outside was cold and still, the kind of quiet that hangs heavy after a long day.

I took the backroad, like I always did—a narrow ribbon of asphalt that cut through thick woods and empty fields. It was faster than the highway, though far lonelier. Most nights, it felt peaceful. That night, it felt endless.

At first, the engine hummed along just fine. Then, without warning, it coughed, sputtered, and shuddered. I pressed the gas, but the truck jerked and slowed, choking on itself. A thin line of smoke curled up from under the hood. Seconds later, the engine died completely. I coasted to the shoulder and stopped, the silence swallowing the last rumble of the motor.

I got out and popped the hood, half-hoping it would magically fix itself. The battery looked fine, the belts still in place—but when I turned the key again, all I got was that weak, hopeless click. I tried three more times. Same thing.

My phone was almost dead, but I figured I had just enough battery to call for help. The signal flickered in and out, though, like it was teasing me. I stepped away from the truck, pacing on the gravel shoulder. The woods loomed on both sides, black and still, branches bending low over the road like arms ready to grab.

Then, finally, headlights appeared in the distance. I waved both arms, relief flooding through me.

A dark sedan slowed and pulled up behind me. Two men stepped out. Both were tall, broad-shouldered. The driver wore a dark jacket, the passenger a cap pulled low over his face.

“You okay?” the driver asked, his voice flat, unreadable.

“Yeah,” I said, trying to sound casual. “Truck died. You guys have jumper cables?”

They exchanged a look. “No,” the driver said. “But let me see if I can call someone.”

He walked back to his car, phone in hand, while his friend stayed outside—arms crossed, leaning against their door, eyes fixed on me.

Something in my gut twisted. Maybe it was the way they didn’t look worried, or how the second man hadn’t said a word. I nodded and walked back to my truck, locking the doors as quietly as I could.

I called my brother. He lived maybe fifteen minutes away. It rang several times before he picked up.

“Hey—it’s me,” I said, voice low. “Truck broke down on the backroad. Battery’s dead. Can you bring jumper cables? Please, hurry.”

He groaned about the late hour but said he’d come. “Ten minutes. Don’t get out of the truck.”

I waited, eyes flicking to the rearview mirror every few seconds. The two men were still there. The driver got out again.

“Help on the way?” he called out.

“I think so,” I said through the window.

“Good,” he replied, smiling faintly. But he didn’t leave.

A few minutes later, more headlights appeared. Another car slowed to a stop behind theirs. Two more men got out, greeting the first pair like old friends. They talked quietly, too quietly, but I could see them glancing at my truck between sentences. None of them carried tools.

My pulse quickened. Something was wrong. I gripped the steering wheel, forcing myself to breathe slow, steady.

I called my brother again. “Where are you? There are four guys here now. I don’t like this.”

“I’m almost there,” he said, his voice tense. “Two minutes. Stay put. Keep the doors locked.”

Through the mirror, I saw one of the new arrivals step closer to my truck, stopping just beside the window. He bent down, his face almost touching the glass.

“Need a hand?” he asked softly.

“No,” I said. “My brother’s almost here.”

He lingered, eyes studying me like he was memorizing my face. Then he turned and walked back to the others. They huddled together, whispering, one of them pointing toward my truck.

That was the longest two minutes of my life.

Then—finally—another set of headlights appeared, moving fast. My brother’s car screeched to a stop beside me. He jumped out, tall, solid, with a baseball bat in his hand. He tossed another one to me through the cracked window.

“You okay?” he said loudly, making sure they heard him.

“Yeah,” I said, gripping the bat.

He stepped forward, standing between my truck and them. “We’ve got it handled,” he said. “You can go.”

The driver of the first car stepped forward, jaw tight. “We were just trying to help.”

“No need,” my brother shot back. “Move along.”

The standoff stretched for what felt like forever. Then, slowly, they started backing toward their cars, eyes never leaving us.

As my brother lifted the hood to hook up the cables, I scanned the dark around us. Something felt off.

“Where’s the fourth guy?” I whispered.

My brother froze, eyes narrowing. “What?”

I pointed toward the treeline. “There—someone’s moving.”

A figure crouched in the brush, inching closer.

My brother kept his voice calm. “Start the truck once I connect.”

He worked fast, hands steady despite the tension. “Try it now,” he said.

I turned the key. The engine roared to life. Relief hit me like a wave—just before a brick smashed through the back window.

Glass exploded across the seat. Then—gunshots. Sharp, deafening cracks. Metal pinged, glass shattered. I ducked, slamming the gas pedal. My brother dove into his car, reversing hard, tires screaming.

We tore down that road, hearts hammering, every shadow feeling alive. They didn’t follow.

At home, under the harsh garage light, we saw the damage—bullet holes in the door, shattered glass everywhere. My dad listened to what happened, his face pale and tight.

“Sounds like those guys who’ve been hitting cars out that way,” he said quietly. “You’re lucky you got out.”

I never took that backroad again.

But the story didn’t end there.

A week later, someone at work mentioned a string of robberies on rural roads—people pretending to help stranded drivers before attacking them. Some never made it home. The thought made my skin crawl.

Months passed, but I couldn’t shake it. Every time I drove at night, I kept one hand near my phone, the other near something heavy.

Then one evening, after visiting family, I cut through a different backroad—wider, safer, I thought. Halfway through, the truck sputtered again. I pulled over, cursing.

A van stopped behind me. An older man stepped out, smiling warmly. “Trouble?” he asked.

“Just a wire,” I said, hesitant.

“Let me take a look,” he offered.

My instincts screamed no—but he seemed harmless. We fixed the wire, and the truck started. “Thanks,” I said, forcing a smile.

He waved as I pulled away. Maybe he was just kind. Maybe not. I’ll never know.

Months later, another night. Another shortcut. Another stall.

Only this time, I didn’t wait. I locked the doors, killed the lights, and called for help immediately. When two men pulled up minutes later, asking if I needed a hand, I didn’t answer. I just waited.

When a real driver stopped behind them—one with cables and a concerned tone—the first two men left without a word.

That’s when I understood.

The backroads have their own rules—quiet, lonely, and filled with people who don’t always mean well. You learn to trust your gut out there. To keep your doors locked. To never let your guard down.

And every time I pass a stranded car now, I wonder which side of the story I’m looking at.





# ""Red Dirt and Silence"":

I was behind the wheel that night, the endless stretch of red dirt and dry scrub blurring past beneath our headlights. The outback has a way of swallowing sound, and even the engine’s hum felt small out there. My boyfriend sat next to me, twisting the radio dial, trying to catch something—anything—to break the silence. Static, a flicker of distant voices, then nothing.

We’d been driving for hours since the last fuel stop—a faded roadhouse where we’d grabbed meat pies and lukewarm Cokes. The old Kombi rattled the way it always did, doors shaking, dashboard creaking like bones. I loved that van, but that night, every sound started to feel wrong.

Then I saw them—headlights in the rearview mirror, far back but steady. Not fading. Keeping pace.

“Probably just another traveler,” he said when I mentioned it, voice easy but his eyes flicked to the mirror too.

The sun had dropped hours ago, leaving behind that copper haze before the dark swallowed everything whole. Now the world outside was ink-black—no towns, no lights, just an endless road cutting through nothing. The air inside the van felt thick.

He suggested we pull over soon, maybe camp off the side. I nodded but kept driving. Those headlights were closer now, almost too close. The glare filled the mirror.

Then, without warning, the vehicle behind us pulled out and came alongside. A big four-wheel-drive with a canopy. The driver waved his arm out the window, pointing toward the back of our van, motioning urgently. I could barely see his face—shadowed beneath a hat—but he looked insistent.

“Pull over!” he mouthed, gesturing wildly.

“What’s he want?” I asked, slowing down a little.

“Looks like he’s saying there’s something wrong,” my boyfriend said, leaning closer. “Maybe sparks or smoke.”

He wasn’t wrong—out here, people helped each other. That was the rule.

I eased the van onto the shoulder, gravel popping under the tires. The four-wheel-drive stopped behind us, engine still rumbling. My boyfriend got out first, casual as ever, hands in his pockets. I stayed behind the wheel, engine idling, eyes fixed on the mirror.

The man climbed down from his truck—a tall figure, rough around the edges, with a mustache and long hair tucked under a sun-beaten hat. A dog shifted in the cab behind him, its shape moving in the shadows.

I cracked the window, listening.  
He called out, “Saw sparks under your van! Could be your muffler. Want me to take a look?”

My boyfriend nodded. “Yeah, sure, mate. Appreciate it. Been driving all day—don’t need a fire starting.”

They went to the back of the van, their voices muffled. I leaned to see better, but the angle was bad. The man said something about needing tools. My boyfriend laughed lightly. “Nah, we’re good, just backpacking around.”

Then—silence.

Too much silence.

“Everything okay back there?” I called, trying to sound casual.

No answer.

A hollow dread crawled through me. I turned the key, killed the engine, and stepped out. The night hit me—cool, dry, endless. Stars hung so close they looked like pinholes in the sky. I rounded the van just in time to hear a sound that didn’t belong—a sharp, flat *crack* that tore through the dark.

My boyfriend dropped instantly. No sound, just a wet collapse. Blood bloomed black across his shirt.

The man stood over him, gun raised, smoke curling from the barrel.

I screamed.

He was on me before the echo died. “Shut up,” he hissed, pressing the gun to my ribs. His voice was low, gravelly—too calm. “Get in the van.”

I froze, heart slamming. “Please,” I whispered. “We don’t have money—”

“Move.”

He shoved me toward the driver’s seat, wrenching my arms behind me. The bite of plastic zip ties cut into my wrists. I twisted, gasping. “Why are you doing this?”

He didn’t answer. His breath stank of cigarettes and sweat as he knelt, binding my ankles too. I kicked out, caught his arm. He grunted, cursed under his breath. “Stop that.”

Then came the slap—hard, ringing, stars bursting behind my eyes.

He dragged me out by the hair, toward his truck. The dog barked wildly now, claws scraping at the window. I caught one last glimpse of my boyfriend—his body still, eyes open toward the stars.

“Why?” I choked. “He didn’t do anything.”

“Quiet,” the man snapped, and yanked a sack over my head. The rough fabric scratched my face, the smell of dust and oil filling my nose. Panic closed in with the darkness.

I heard him grunt, dragging something heavy—a thud into the truck bed. My stomach twisted.

He shoved me into the cab’s back, face down on the floor. “Stay there.”

The door slammed. Footsteps circled. Then the engine turned over.

That was my moment.

I twisted, wrists burning, ankles straining. One tie slipped loose—barely. I pulled my leg free, pushed against the door handle with everything I had.

The door swung open. I tumbled into the dirt, the sack still on, scraping my knees. Behind me, he shouted, “Hey!”

I ran.

Blind through the dark, through the scrub, branches tearing at my arms. I ripped the sack off mid-stride, lungs burning, heart breaking open in my chest. The flashlight beam cut through the dark behind me.

“Come out!” he called, voice echoing off nothing. “I won’t hurt you!”

Liar.

I dropped low, scrambling under a thick shrub, every sound in my body screaming to stay still. The light swept past, so close I saw his boots crunching dry twigs inches from my face.

The dog barked again, farther off now. He moved away.

I waited. Minutes stretched, melted into hours. My body shook with cold and shock, but I didn’t move. Not until the night swallowed him completely.

Then—distant—headlights.

A big rig rolling slow along the highway. I stumbled out, waving wildly. The driver braked hard, air hissing, eyes wide as he saw me.

“Help,” I croaked. “He shot my boyfriend. He’s still out there.”

They pulled me in, wrapped a jacket around me. One of them grabbed the radio, voice trembling. “We’ve got a girl here—looks like she’s been attacked.”

I told them everything in broken pieces. The man, the gun, the escape. They drove me to a pub near the next roadhouse, where the cops met us.

By dawn, police were scouring the highway. They found blood, the van hidden off the track, but not him. Not the body.

Days blurred into interviews, headlines, judgment. The questions came sharp: *Why did you pull over? Why didn’t you fight harder?*

Because you can’t think like that when you’re staring down a gun.

It took a year before they caught him—a drifter with a record, a ghost moving through truck stops and campsites. The face in court was the same one from my nightmares: long hair, mustache, cold eyes that never blinked.

I told the jury everything. My voice didn’t shake.

Guilty. Life in prison.

But my boyfriend’s body was never found. The outback keeps its secrets.

Now, I drive differently. Full tank. Daylight only. No stops for strangers. I still see that flash sometimes—the moment the gun went off, the look in his eyes.

I escaped that night, but not all of me did. Some part of me is still out there in the scrub, crouched in the dark, waiting for the light to pass.",1,1760483462.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

I always knew i spent a lot of time on my phone, I didnt realise it was quite so high, it was also intriguing to see how much was spent on apps that i thought I had only stopped on for a short period of time. Looking back on it, I have already noticed some patterns and areas that are going to take the most work. Like this morning when I was in line waiting for a coffee, my phone was out and I was scrolling before i even realised.

I believe I am alot deeper in this phone trap than what I thought I was but I am ready to dig out.

One of the stories might have been The Great Gilly Hopkins, but I am not sure because when I search based off of that, I can't find anything.

But the other story I remember quite vividly is about a boy who lived with his uncle in a car because his mother died. He is pretty mean to his uncle and disdainfully remarks on how his uncle always eats dry cereal for meals, which he calls dog food. He goes and buys himself a burger from the mall and does crappy things like adding cigarette ash to this random woman's coffee. At some point he learns that his uncle made a lot of sacrifices to take care of him and loves him.

I just remember these stories were one of the firsts that made me emotional as a child and would love to know what they were!",3,1760483410.0,whatsthatbook,0,1.0,False
1o6uuux,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1o6uuux/practically_ghosted_after_sex5th_date/,Practically Ghosted After Sex/5th Date,"Met a girl a few years older than me on Hinge. Had what I thought were 5 great dates. 5th date having sex.

Here's what stands out:

1. Prior to sex she was very playful in her texting. I matched her energy. I tried to keep in tune with matching her energy in all aspects.

2. 1st date was a hour long or so coffee date. 2nd date was a motorcycle ride with me to dinner and then make-out at her car. 3rd date was going for a 3 mile run with her along the beach, another make out session. 4th date was a hike and a make out session in the woods.

3. 5th date included her gifting me a Yeti mug since she made fun of my broke ass mug I had. Luckily I had a gift in hand for her too.... a bottle of her favorite wine. We went to a park near her house for like a 30 min walk. Went back to her house, played Jenga, drank wine, got intimate. I ensured to pleasure her first. She was twitching..... it seemed she was loving it. Went to the bedroom and from what I could tell it went very well. We showered (separately) and then went to get pizza and brought it back to her place (I paid). Nothing seemed off or awkward. She initiated a 6th date for the next day since she really wanted to ride on the motorcycle with me. I kissed her and left.

Next morning, she texts me and says she is feeling sick and will have to cancel. I responded ""no worries I hope you feel better soon"". She texted ""thanks"". I could already tell her text style dropped significantly. Two days go by and no communication between either of us. After 48 hrs I text ""how are you feeling?"". She replied ""I am better. Thanks for checking."". Again, tone shift. I responded ""Glad you are feeling better. Maybe we can pick up that motorcycle ride again sometime"". Nothing since then and that was yesterday.

I know the game here.... no more communication from me unless she initiates. What the heck happened here? I swallow my pride and think maybe she didn't enjoy sex. It sure as hell seemed like she did. Again, no awkwardness after when we had pizza and SHE wanted that motorcycle ride the next day.

She is divorced and so am I.

— **Senator Toschkl of the Leran Syndicate, Federation Senate hearing regarding rising tensions in the outer Batract systems.**  
***1 B.I. (Before Independence)***

 

*Clack… clack-clack.*

There it was again. Gerber switched his ocular to thermal, scanning for the source of the sound.

“Visser, is it possible that there’s something alive here?”

Visser didn’t move, staring straight at the towering tank swallowed by darkness. “No, sir. Even if we had rats aboard, we’ve been eighty-six days in transit — that radiation would’ve killed any rats left alive.”

“Rats!?” Gerber wasn’t thrilled by the thought of them living aboard his ship.

“Yeah, it’s possible that—” Visser stopped mid-sentence. “Sir!”

Gerber turned, following the beam of Visser’s flashlight.

It was by far the biggest rat he had ever seen — but what truly terrified him was the mold-green fungus growing from its back and the white, blind, dead eyes. *They can take over dead animals. Wonderful.*

Without a second thought, Gerber fired his handgun. The rat burst apart, and Gerber silently thanked his foresight for bringing his father’s trusted Desert Eagle Mk XXXV, which he had received as a gift from a Texas Free-State ranger during the war, instead of his usual duty Glock 90.

The sound of the shot echoed through the catacombs, bouncing off the steel and stone until it faded. Then — as if the noise had been a signal — the tapping and clacking began again, this time from every direction.

“Run to the next exit!” Gerber barked. He couldn’t tell what the mass of heat moving behind them and down the tank corridor was. His ocular lacked the resolution — but it sure as hell wasn’t rats, and he wasn’t planning to stay and find out.

“There’s none on this level — only up or down from us!” Visser’s voice was edging toward panic. The whole gangway was shaking now.

“Down! Go, go, go!”

What Visser saw through his thermal feed was close to a nightmare — a writhing mass of small bodies. Some looked like dog-sized rats, others like six-legged spiders, and between them moved the familiar heat signatures of the gecko-like Batract.

He tried to contact *Lyra* again but got no response. “How do they jam us, Visser?”

Visser was already at the ladder; sliding down, he shouted, “They don’t. The inner hull is seventy millimeters of P950 steel with an inlaid Faraday cage — they just need to destroy the repeaters, and that’s it.”

Gerber cursed. Reaching the ladder, he copied Visser’s technique to slide down, changed the magazine, pressed a button on the gun, and said, “Dragonfire Plasma.” *Fuck regulations.* Protomatter bullets were extremely expensive and banned on Earth, but he wasn’t anywhere near Earth.

He fired at the first thing that reached the upper end of the ladder. The fireball melted everything in its path, evaporating three of the spider-rats; the rest hesitated to climb down. “You better stay back, you ugly freaks!” Gerber yelled.

“Twenty meters that way!” Visser was already running, shouting the direction.

Gerber followed. Behind him, he could hear the mass of nightmares slamming against the metal gangway.

*Did the Batract grow those things?*

They reached the door. Visser entered his code hastily while Gerber knelt down, ready to kill anything that came too close. The door seemed to take forever to open.

Visser slipped out. “Come — it’s open!”

Gerber fired into the dark to convince the monsters not to follow, the fireball illuminating the catacombs until it struck a mass of bodies. Then he turned and sprinted after Visser.

As he was about to step into the bright hallways of the ship, a strong reptilian hand grabbed him from above, yanking him upward; his weapon clattered to the deck.

A Batract hung from the gangway on the upper level, pulling Gerber toward its head.

“Captain, not so quickly. It was very uncivilized of you to shoot this host... it served us for centuries.”

The head of the beast had a hole through the skull, yellow slime oozing from the wound. The foul stench Batract usually carried was now a hundred times stronger. Even through the suit’s filters, Gerber had to force himself not to vomit.

“We will have to take your body. Too bad humans can’t be taken alive — otherwise, you would soon see…”

Whatever the Batract intended Gerber to see remained a secret. The head exploded in a hot blue ball of plasma; half a second later, the entire upper body evaporated.

Gerber dropped to the level below. Karrn stood there like a poster child from an old western, Gerber’s gun in one hand, smoke coiling from the barrel.

“I would very much like to have a weapon such as this.” Karrn handed the weapon back to Gerber, admiration in his eyes.

“Yeah, buddy — first let’s get out of here.” Gerber was sure as hell he would never enter the catacombs again. *Never.*

\----------

Rish was still nauseous. *Spherical Vomit Dispersion System* — very fitting.

Karrn would say that for such a system to exist, it took three idiots: one to think of it, one to build it, and one to actually enter it and be dumb enough to try it.

Her vision was still blurred. Tulk wasn’t better off; he was vomiting again. *Serves you right for eating those addictive potato chips all night.*

Krun just grunted once and said it wasn’t bad. *Is he wagging his tail? Did he really enjoy this ride?*

After getting shot out of the drop pod, her memory was spotty. She remembered the pod veering away and attracting the colony’s air defense. Then the transparent sphere they were in began to spin through the airflow, the G’s rising and the pod filling with kinetic gel.

The next thing she knew, she woke just as Tulk vomited inside his helmet. She felt sorry for the young hunter for a second — then she vomited too.

The internal cleaning of the suit started, but she knew it wouldn’t help much. *Wonderful. I get to represent humans on this mission with high command, covered in my own vomit.*

Now her pack and the human force recon team hid under cover in the colony’s central park. The sphere had hit the exact spot the satellites had selected — still supersonic. The re-entry heat had been absorbed by the initially cool gel, and the gel vaporized on impact with the ground.

*Imagine jumping out of a spaceship, accelerating to hypersonic speed, trusting your life to some gel — and surviving. No wonder humans are mad.*

Sergeant Richards sat next to Tulk, patting him on the back. “Told ya — it’s a hell-ride. Let it out, buddy; you’ll feel better.”

Next to Rish, the medic of Bravo Team, Lance Corporal Miller, knelt down beside her. “Here, Pack Leader. I checked with *Lyra* and Doc Nesbitt — you can take these pills; they’ll help with nausea and the headache.”

Rish could only nod and took one of the white pills while the medic went over to Tulk.

Lieutenant Koval returned from a short scouting trip. “Area looks clear. Most guards went to the outskirts of the city to check the debris from the drop pod — the colony’s AA ate it up. Impressive.”

“Well, it was designed to destroy any chance of an invasion. Your first landing was a massive surprise, and you took out the generators astonishingly quickly and precisely. Now the subterranean fusion plant is online, and nothing lands on the planet without the colony allowing it.”

Rish started to feel better; now if she could only shower to get rid of the stench.

The lieutenant bit his lip — a tic Rish had noticed a few times before. “Yeah, they even shot at ships from your own fleet that tried to land yesterday.”

Her ears flicked in annoyance as Rish replied, “I think they’re afraid beyond reason. Your actions are too alien to them. But we were sure our report would address that — it’s all very suspicious.” In truth, she had no explanation for the colony’s strange behavior.

“So, are you fit to scout ahead?” Lieutenant Koval seemed eager to continue — they all were.

Tulk came over to them, already looking better. “Lieutenant, I think stealth might be the wrong way. We could actually walk up to the Parliament without any issues. We’re Shraphen in Shraphen suits — no one would bat an eye at three scouts entering the Parliament, especially after most of the guards went away.”

Krun, who had joined them, added, “It’s the Parliament in crisis mode. Soldiers are moving in and out constantly. Just grab a pack of pads or some paper and look busy; no one would suspect a thing.”

Rish’s ears stood upright. The plan was risky — and unexpected. She watched the lieutenant’s face. If they simply walked up to the building, the humans would have to stay behind. *Do the humans trust us?*

The lieutenant moved his head from left to right a few times, his face hidden behind the visor. The humans had to stay sealed to mask their scent. Then he seemed to come to a conclusion.

“Leader Rish, do your people know about the *Playing the Prisoner* trick?”

Rish had never heard of such a thing and shook her head in the human motion she’d already adopted during her short time on the ship.

“You act like you captured us and bring us to Pack Leader Shruf for interrogation. You people never did this?”

“No, no, we didn’t. Our scents would betray us — but it could work with humans, especially given the shock the guards would have seeing you.” Rish ran through the scene in her head. *Yeah… seeing something that looked like a tai in chains would definitely catch them off guard.*

The lieutenant leaned forward, curious. His whole team had now huddled close to the Shraphen, listening in, while Krun kept watch nearby.

“What do you mean, surprised? That we look alien? I thought that was expected.”

Rish glanced at Krun; his look back was unmistakable — *we’re allies… tell them.*

“Lieutenant, you look quite similar to tai. They… they — how should I say this?” Rish stumbled, unsure how to reveal something so embarrassing for the humans. Her tail tucked between her legs and her ears flattened — every Shraphen could see how uneasy this was for her.

“You look like our pets — the tai. We value them and adore them. They’re smart and trustworthy, but not sapient… not like you.” Krun always preferred the quick and direct approach, so he simply threw the truth at the team’s heads.

The lieutenant didn’t move for a second or two — then laughter burst through the intercom.

“Oh boy, Pack Leader, do I have a surprise for you.”

Rish’s ear flicked. *Do they think we’re joking? Don’t they understand what we’re trying to tell them?*

After finally stopping his laughter, the lieutenant continued, “Pack Leader, let me tell you about dogs.”

\----------

All Captain Gerber wanted was a shower and some sleep. The universe granted him neither.

They were on the bridge. After the captain and the admiral were informed about the Batract infestation, the admiral went straight to the CIC — every ship that hadn’t vented the Batract bodies was now in danger.

Karrn was already on his way to the *Rosalind Franklin*. Around fifty hunters from his pack were aboard the ship, and he had convinced the admiral to arm them and support the effort to secure the massive hulk. Most of the Batract bodies were stored there for later study and autopsy — which made the *Franklin* the worst place to be in the fleet.

The onboard security teams together with the Marines detachment moved through the ship with maintenance crews, welding the entry doors to the catacombs shut.

The doors were already secured against outside access, but it was better to be safe than sorry. Now they had to decide how to get rid of the infestation.

“We could open the outer hull to space. The radiation would kill the spawn over time,” Lieutenant Commander Miller, the chief security officer, murmured as he scrolled through the progress report.

“Not acceptable. It could take days, and in the meantime parts of the ship would be unprotected. We still don’t know what’s happening in the colony — and if the enemy fleet somehow slipped through our sensors, we’d be vulnerable.”

Captain Carmichel’s tone made it perfectly clear what he thought about leaving his ship open to outside attack.

“What about microwave sterilization? It works on rooms — why not the space between the hulls?” The question came from an officer Gerber didn’t know; his ocular identified her as Lieutenant Sanders, Navigation.

“Not possible. First of all, I’d have to send men in there with the equipment — something I won’t do unless we have no other choice. And even then, the next problem is space. The catacombs are massive: gangways, pipes, struts connecting the hulls, spaces between tanks, behind and above the tanks. It’s not possible.”

Chief Ferguson from Engineering rubbed his face. “We’re already having a hard time sealing every connection between the inner hull and the rest of the ship. A few moments ago, slime started growing out of a shower drain on D-Deck. It’s a nightmare.”

Chief Ferguson was clearly exhausted. He brought up the ship’s schematics. “I’m playing whack-a-mole with a giant slimy fungus and its spawn. The ship has a lot more connections than the construction plans officially show — probably because of all the last-minute modifications.” The last words were clearly aimed at Gerber.

“It’s okay, Chief. We know you’re doing your best. We need solutions, not accusations.” The captain was as stressed as everyone else, but he was a good leader — calm enough to keep the discussion on track.

“Captain, the *Renown* just reported a breach. They’re fighting spawn on several of its decks and requesting assistance.”

The young communications officer’s face had gone pale. Gerber thought about his own fight in the catacombs and understood the man’s fear.

Before the captain could respond, the admiral’s voice came over the intercom — and, as far as Gerber could tell, across every frequency.

“Admiral Browner here. To all elements of the 1st Expeditionary: report status to *Argos CIC*. Close every connection between the inner hull and ship internals. Report every observed enemy behavior to *Lyra*. Supply tender *Mirage*: transfer personal weapons and protective gear to *Rosalind Franklin* and *Marie Curie*. The Shraphen guests have decided to help us secure our ships. I hereby authorize the use of protomatter ammunition in Dragonfire mode against enemy spawn. Browner out.”

“So we’re using POWs now as soldiers, equipping them with banned ammunition that we shouldn’t even have aboard.

All of this after we treated them with an experimental and potentially unethical medical substance. Don’t get me wrong, but how many lines are we actually willing to cross?”

Chief Ferguson asked the gathered officers.

The captain was about to speak before Ferguson continued.

“Sir, I fully stand behind those orders — they’re logical and all. I just wanted to play devil’s advocate. It’s a slippery slope, after all.”

“Noted. Now, back to the discussion,” was all the captain said.

The door to the bridge slid open, and a breathless Lieutenant Davies shoved the maintenance technician Visser inside.

“We know how to kill the Batract, sirs! Oh — request permission to enter the bridge, Captain!”

The lieutenant looked like she had dragged the poor maintenance tech all across the ship.

“Yes, yes, what’s your plan, maintenance tech…?”

“Visser, Captain. Maintenance technician, first grade Visser.”

The tech was clearly unwell — first the encounter with the Batract spawn, and now the probably more frightening encounter with the ship’s captain. Gerber was truly sorry for him.

“Ah, the other hero of our story. What’s your plan, young man?”

“We grill them — with the A-drive’s magnetic field generator. We pump out the kinetic gel from the outer hull layers, open just the overpressure vents to space, then open the water tank valves so they don’t explode.”

“At last, we charge the drive and hold the magnetic bottle field for about, hmm… two minutes. That should be enough to heat the outer and inner hull to six hundred degrees.”

The captain just blinked. Davies was bouncing behind Visser like a cheerleader; Gerber decided to cut her coffee supply.

Then Ferguson said, “Yes — yes, that’s it. We could bring it up even to thirteen hundred without losing integrity. The water in the tanks would go supercritical and vaporize everything between the hulls.”

The captain stared at the two engineers, then simply asked, “*Lyra*?”

“The math checks out. I’m already calculating the magnetic variances with the other ship VIs to maximize heating for every vessel and hit every nook and cranny of each ship’s catacombs equally.”

“Do it,” the captain ordered, “and inform the admiral that we’re about to cook the whole ship. Even with the internal cooling system, it’s going to get hot in here.”

With that, the officers scrambled back to their stations.

Gerber just stood there, deep in thought, not noticing that he was blocking the captain’s path back to his chair.

“Gerber? Anything else?”

Captain Carmichel’s annoyed tone shook him out of his thoughts.

“Yes. Earth. We sent the message about Plan Red four days ago. That means in eighty-two days Earth Gov will start the rebellion there — same with every fleet, transporter, and colony. It’ll be a bloodbath. And they don’t know how dangerous the ‘dead’ Batract are. If they can create that many spawns in the catacombs, how dangerous will they be on a planet like Earth?”

Carmichel’s eyes went wide. “Fuck.”

“Very eloquent description, sir.”

“Comms, prepare a status report — include everything we know about Batract spawn and their potential planetary threat. Send it with a pigeon to every naval asset, stat! Tenfold redundancy — three at military speed.”

“Understood, sending now, sir.”

With tenfold redundancy, the ship launched twenty FTL message torpedoes — three of which weren’t cruising at the safe 36.5 times the speed of light but at the riskier 38c — toward every nearby Allied Navy asset and toward Earth.

Gerber made a quick calculation. The distance between Earth and Sirius was about 8.6 light-years; at 38c, the travel time would be eighty-two days and roughly fourteen hours.

It had to be enough. He was sure that until he saw Earth again, nightmares of spawn roaming his home would be his constant companion.

\----------

They walked out of the park toward the entrance of the Parliament. Rish’s pack surrounded the two humans, who were out of their suits and holding their hands up.

Krun had his helmet open and played the role of pack leader for the guard — he was *“the coolest of you,”* as the lieutenant had called it.

Rish was sure Krun’s body temperature was the same as hers, but she was convinced he could sell the lie without betraying them.

The act of prisoners was played by Lieutenant Koval and Lance Corporal Madsen — a woman with long blond hair. They had chosen her because she seemed the weakest and most harmless of the team.

Rish and Tulk walked at the back, ‘guarding’ the ‘prisoners.’ As they reached the guards, Rish felt her heartbeat rise. She was glad Krun was playing the pack leader.

The guards were clearly shocked to see humans out of their armor — just as planned. Krun walked up to them.

“We’ve got infiltrators. Pack Leader Shruf wants to speak with them immediately.”

“They… they look like tai,” one guard stammered. “Those are the monsters that eat Shraphen alive?”

Rish noticed a slight tremble in Madsen’s arm. *Play it cool, Madsen. Remember — you can’t understand them…*

Krun kept up the charade. Flicking his ears, he replied, “I don’t know about that, but we found them near the thing that was shot down.”

The other guard was older and more suspicious of the small group. “Where are the other scouts that were sent out?”

He circled the humans, sniffing them, his tail raised — a sign of alertness and readiness.

To Rish’s shock Krun snapped, “What do you think they’re doing — looking for more humans? Now, do I have to call Shruf and tell him you’re wasting our time, or can I bring him his prisoners?”

Rish was sure the guard would inspect them closer now — just because.

She had to force her tail to stay upright; beside her, Tulk seemed to be struggling with the same issue.

To her horror, Krun picked up the younger guard’s radio and held it out to the older one. “Or do you want to call him yourself?”

The older guard simply lowered his ears and turned around, making an up-and-down waving signal with his tail — *do what you want.*

The team went through the oversized double doors of the Parliament. When they were sure no one could see or hear them, Rish had to ask Krun, “Where did you learn that?”

Krun grunted. “While you soaked up the database, I found something more entertaining — human spy movies.”

Rish could only stare in disbelief.

“Learned everything there is to know about them — even the big ‘reveal’ about dogs.” Krun even mimicked the human shoulder shrug now.

“And you didn’t say anything?”

“No. You all seemed to be having a lot of fun with your research.” Krun turned around and walked away; for him, the discussion was over.

Lieutenant Koval laughed quietly. “Hell of a guy. You gotta love him.”

Rish just stared as the team moved toward the elevator doors at the end of the hall, ignoring the offices to their left and right. *He’s becoming more and more like humans. Is that good or bad?*

Inside the elevator, Rish finally spoke again. “Down in the bunker it could be more difficult. There will be guards — lots of them — and they won’t buy this ruse.”

“Let me handle this,” Krun said. “I’ve got an idea.” He pulled something from his suit.

Rish couldn’t identify it at first — then she froze. “Your intelligence pack?”

“Was. Long time ago. Kept the badge. I knew I could use it someday.”

The lieutenant whistled through his teeth, raising his brows. Tulk took a step back from Krun.

“What? I was hired back at Burrow — helped the others fight the Batract from the shadows. When we came to Taishon Tar, I left and started fighting them with plasma guns.”

Rish felt a sting of betrayal. She and Krun went way back; she’d known him since Burrow… he’d never said a word.

“Guys — very dramatic, much wow. Can we deal with it after we’re back on the *Argos*? We’re almost there,” Madsen signaled as the lights reached the last sublevel.

Rish refocused. Tulk still seemed hurt, as far as she could tell through the closed suit. “Why weren’t we stopped earlier?”

“Because of this — all-access pass. I should kick Shruf’s ass for not canceling my access.” Krun fiddled with the badge; it showed the stylized head of a Shraphen beneath the symbol for *Shon* — the eye, or seeing, as humans would translate it.

They reached the last sublevel. The doors opened, and they stared into a wall of security guards. Tulk and Rish raised their guns, but Krun stepped in front of the team and, in an unusual commanding voice, said, “High Pack Leader Krun of the Burrow Intelligence Pack — lower your guns or you’ll regret ever being born.”

His ears stood stiff and tall, his tail raised straight up. *He even smells different.*

“I said, lower your guns!”

The guards immediately tucked their tails and obeyed.

“Where’s Shruf — that sorry excuse for a Shraphen?” Krun now played the role of an angry High Pack Leader perfectly and really leaned into it.

“I have high human diplomats here, and he’s hiding like a worm!”

One of the guards pointed toward the office of the Colonial Governor inside the bunker. His whole posture screamed fear.

*I’d be shivering too if Krun ever spoke to me like that.* He seemed bigger — menacing, dangerous.

Krun didn’t hesitate; he stormed to the office and literally kicked the door in.

The governor — an older Shraphen, formerly a religious leader who still wore only a plain tunic without decoration — rose in shock at the disturbance.

To Rish’s surprise, Krun dropped to his knees and exposed his neck. “Governor, I’m High Pack Leader Krun, Burrow Intelligence Pack. I’m sorry to disturb you. We have messengers from the humans but could not reach you, so we assumed the worst.”

Shruf rose as well, aiming a gun at the humans. “Not a step closer, you monsters. We deciphered Karrn’s last message — you killed every Shraphen you abducted and plan to do the same to every colonist.”

Tulk was quick to react. He jumped into the room and trained a human handgun on Shruf’s head. “Pull the trigger and it will be the last thing you do.”

Rish stepped forward to shield the humans as the governor moved out from behind his desk and put a hand on both Tulk’s and Shruf’s guns. “Stop. Stop — everyone, put your guns away. Can anyone explain what is going on here?”

Krun rose slowly, his head still lowered, still exposing his neck and playing the diplomat. *Damn — he must have been a master spy.* Rish was genuinely impressed, almost enough to forget her anger.

“Governor, I assure you, Karrn never sent such a message. In fact, I saw hundreds of Shraphen being treated for their wounds by the humans.”

“Lies! Lies! They killed everyone!” Shruf nearly screeched, trying to raise his gun again.

Krun crossed the room and backhanded the smaller Shraphen across the face. “Shruf, you’re an idiot and a coward eight days a week — can’t you take one day off?”

Rish pulled the human lieutenant forward with her. “Please, Governor — they risked their lives to talk to you. Call the human fleet. It’s urgent. A Batract fleet might be on their way.”

The governor looked down at Shruf, blood dripping from his mouth, eyes burning with rage. Then he turned to the guards who had been alerted by the commotion and waved them away.

At last, his gaze met Rish’s. She would later swear he was staring straight into her soul.

Then he asked her, his voice warm and calm, “Do you trust them?”

1o6ului,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hobbies/comments/1o6ului/i_have_hobby_disabilty/,I have hobby disabilty,"Hi, I’m a 22-year-old law student from Turkey, currently in my fourth year. I don’t really know where to start. I have friends, money, and time, yet I can’t seem to enjoy or connect with any hobby. I really want to have hobbies since I find them very beneficial for mental health, social life, and overall happiness — plus, they’re supposed to be fun. Another reason I want a hobby is because having coffee or dinner started to feel boring. I would like to be active when I am with people (ADHD-ish issue) For example, instead of chatting while sitting and sipping coffee, I enjoy chatting while working out or playing 8ball more.

I go to the gym three times a week and have been doing so for about three years now. I have a decent physique (depending on the lighting). But I don’t really consider the gym a hobby since the main reason I go is that without it, I become very physically inactive.

I’ve tried a lot of sports, including skiing and sailing, which I actually found pretty cool — but they’re not sustainable since I can’t really do them in the city I live in.

Last semester, my friends and I started playing 8-ball quite a lot. It was fun at first, but now I feel like I don’t enjoy it that much anymore. Once or twice a month is fine, but doing it more often just feels boring.

I’m not sure how to find something I genuinely enjoy — not because of its benefits, but simply because I like doing it. Has anyone else gone through a phase like this? How do someone find a hobby?",1,1760482763.0,Hobbies,0,0.67,False
1o6ulp4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1o6ulp4/i_completely_ruined_my_life_and_i_have_no_hope_it/,I completely ruined my life and I have no hope it can ever get better,"I did this to myself. I should have made better decisions. I should have known better. Hell, most of the time I *did* know better. But I cannot avoid the consequences of my bad decisions now. Knowing what I should have done differently can never erase the position I've put myself in. And now I am no longer a young woman and I can’t see any way to fix this mess in the time I have left.

The first mistake was getting involved with my now ex husband. We were in high school together. He was manipulative and an abuser and it happened so slowly that I just got used to it as it got worse and worse. I should have realized what was happening and I should have left him but I didn’t. I loved him and I shouldn’t have. I let him hit me and make me do things I didn’t want to do and instead of leaving and making something of myself I just turned to alcohol and isolated myself further. I spent my twenties going to work and coming home and drinking myself stupid to get numb enough to get through another day. I stayed with him for almost 20 years and I missed everything. I will never get to have a young adulthood now. My twenties are just a blur of alcoholism and being abused. I made no progress in my life, saved no money, got nowhere in a career. I didn’t get to have fun or make memories or friends. All because I was too stupid and shortsighted and drunk to stand up for myself. Because I couldn’t make the right decision. I screwed myself out of so much that makes a human life whole.

Then the pandemic hit and I had to work from home for over a year and I slowly snapped out of it. I tried so hard to get my shit together and fix my life. On paper I did all the right things. I sobered up. I haven’t touched alcohol or any drugs stronger than coffee since December of 2020. I went back to school, got a degree in a well paying field. I moved to an area with the best ratio of cost-of-living to median income I could find and found a much better job. I divorced my ex husband, got full custody of our kid, and got a judgment against him for child support and the debt he left in my name. I worked my ass off, got raises and promotions, and now I make 120% the average income for my field. I met a wonderful man who’s an amazing partner and I got remarried. I’ve made more mistakes, too, like I bought a car that I hate and now I’m stuck with the stupid thing. Still, overall I should be a success story.

But it was too little, too late. I’m just barely too old for all of this to pay off in time. I keep circling around the same numbers, staring at the same spreadsheets, and I keep coming back to the same inevitable conclusion. I will have to keep working hard, putting every penny towards paying off debts and contributing to my retirement account for the rest of my life and I will likely still not have quite enough to retire.

I can’t significantly increase my income without either lottery-winning levels of luck or starting over in a different career and then the time and financial costs of retraining and gaining experience make it unlikely to have a reasonable ROI. I currently make low six figures in tech, there’s not much that reliably earns better without requiring advanced degrees or decades of experience.

I can’t significantly reduce my expenses, both because they’re already cut to the bone and because moving anywhere with a lower cost of living adversely affects my earning potential more than the lower cost of living helps. My location is well optimized for what I do; saving $1000 on rent is actively making my financial situation worse if I have to take a $15k pay cut to get it. Conversely, I could make more money in a location like the Bay Area or New York but the higher cost of living wouldn’t be worth it. It’s a moot point, anyway; my custody agreement bars me from moving “any significant distance” until 2031 and I’m my kid’s only parent.

I will never buy a house. I will never get to drive a nice car. I will not be able to pay for my child’s college or leave them anything. No fun. No joy. Nothing but working and eating the cheapest food I can find to keep me going for the rest of my days. I will never be able to afford even so little as a small vacation or a night out with friends for the rest of my life. Not that I have friends, anyway, after getting sober and then moving to a city a thousand miles away as an adult. No one here knows me or wants to get to know me. I feel like if I had thirty or forty more years I could pull it off. But I don’t. I have just enough time to catch up and finish turning things around and then die having just barely managed to scrabble my way back to square one.",4,1760482752.0,Advice,13,0.7,False

When i was 4 he freaked out when babysitting me and my sister and he put us in car, drove like a maniac then rolled window down and screened at construction workers then got home and threw coffee and couch. Once he was in a rage and put holes in the wall in front of me and my sister. I think i was 10. I remember he threw a pizza at my mom once, and once on easter he threw coffee inside and it was everywhere. I remember when i was 10 he told me he was leaving and i was “90% of this shit”. He once said he wishes i wasnt born, think i was 11. When i was 19 he ban ged his head on the wall and ran to his shed told me he was gonna  end  himself. i was dialing in 9 1 1 just so happen my mom pulled in the driveway. I remember on 4th july he woke and up freaked out for no reason and woke me and my sister up in a rage. i was probably 10. Once when i was 5 i asked him to help me with my legos and he grabbed it from me, looked at it, then threw it. When i was 12 he got in road rage with a biker and the biker said  some stuff. . i was terrifi ed.. My dad told me to suck it up or whatrver the fuck he said. Once he broke a light by throwing pencil holder. He threatened me of my life when i was 18 cuz i didnt go home  one night bc well, i hated him then too. And this is just the stuff that comes to the top of my head. Hes ruined vacations, holidays, etc

When i was 17 him and my uncle got in a huge blow out  at 3am. He pushed my uncle, uncle ran to closet for his you know what… Scariest thing ever, i got  my mom and we ran.  9 1 1 came. Thanks to the both of them. 
 
Now, im 23 and im very angry and obviously its deep rooted. My parents are still married living happily ever after. They had countless of boy who cried wolf times where they were getting a “divorce”. During these times, my mom acknowledged all this abuse and how hes a nightmare. Now that everything is just “dandy” she acts like nothing ever happened. . His mom was abusive supposedly. I havent heard from her in over ten years.. I honestly hate him, and ive tried to be neutral, but when i look at him i just feel disgusted. and ive told him i cant wait til he just passes. That  is wrong of me isnt it.

I currently make low six figures in tech, there’s not much that reliably earns better without requiring advanced degrees or decades of experience.

I can’t significantly reduce my expenses, both because they’re already cut to the bone and because moving anywhere with a lower cost of living adversely affects my earning potential more than the lower cost of living helps. My location is well optimized for what I do; saving $1000 on rent is actively making my financial situation worse if I have to take a $15k pay cut to get it. Conversely, I could make more money in a location like the Bay Area or New York but the higher cost of living wouldn’t be worth it. It’s a moot point, anyway; my custody agreement bars me from moving “any significant distance” until 2031 and I’m my kid’s only parent.I will never buy a house. I will never get to drive a nice car. I will not be able to pay for my child’s college or leave them anything. No fun. No joy. Nothing but working and eating the cheapest food I can find to keep me going for the rest of my days. I will never be able to afford even so little as a small vacation or a night out with friends for the rest of my life.

1o6uk74,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1o6uk74/i_completely_ruined_my_life_and_i_have_no_hope_it/,I completely ruined my life and I have no hope it can ever get better,"I did this to myself. I should have made better decisions. I should have known better. Hell, most of the time I *did* know better. But I cannot avoid the consequences of my bad decisions now. Knowing what I should have done differently can never erase the position I've put myself in. And now I am no longer a young woman and I can’t see any way to fix this mess in the time I have left.

The first mistake was getting involved with my now ex husband. We were in high school together. He was manipulative and an abuser and it happened so slowly that I just got used to it as it got worse and worse. I should have realized what was happening and I should have left him but I didn’t. I loved him and I shouldn’t have. I let him hit me and make me do things I didn’t want to do and instead of leaving and making something of myself I just turned to alcohol and isolated myself further. I spent my twenties going to work and coming home and drinking myself stupid to get numb enough to get through another day. I stayed with him for almost 20 years and I missed everything. I will never get to have a young adulthood now. My twenties are just a blur of alcoholism and being abused. I made no progress in my life, saved no money, got nowhere in a career. I didn’t get to have fun or make memories or friends. All because I was too stupid and shortsighted and drunk to stand up for myself. Because I couldn’t make the right decision. I screwed myself out of so much that makes a human life whole.

Then the pandemic hit and I had to work from home for over a year and I slowly snapped out of it. I tried so hard to get my shit together and fix my life. On paper I did all the right things. I sobered up. I haven’t touched alcohol or any drugs stronger than coffee since December of 2020. I went back to school, got a degree in a well paying field. I moved to an area with the best ratio of cost-of-living to median income I could find and found a much better job. I divorced my ex husband, got full custody of our kid, and got a judgment against him for child support and the debt he left in my name. I worked my ass off, got raises and promotions, and now I make 120% the average income for my field. I met a wonderful man who’s an amazing partner and I got remarried. I’ve made more mistakes, too, like I bought a car that I hate and now I’m stuck with the stupid thing. Still, overall I should be a success story.

But it was too little, too late. I’m just barely too old for all of this to pay off in time. I keep circling around the same numbers, staring at the same spreadsheets, and I keep coming back to the same inevitable conclusion. I will have to keep working hard, putting every penny towards paying off debts and contributing to my retirement account for the rest of my life and I will likely still not have quite enough to retire.
