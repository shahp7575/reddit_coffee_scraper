3 years? I had it for 10 years and i recovered within 30 days. Its your fault that its been 3 years. Sorry but its true. Cut cigarettes, cut coffee, cut snything thats stresses you, cut your job if you have to, cut relationship if you have to(if it stresses you), go gym, hardcore cardio+muscle, meditate every day, stop social media, go to bed same time and sleep same amount, stop reddit, stop youtube, stop video games. Let your brain take a big rest. The main goal here is dopamine detox…its all about optimizinh at first. Buy the necessary suplemments, live a healthy diet…from there all healing with a little introspection will happen automatically. If you dont do those things i would not be surprised that u feel this way until you die. If you have ANY excuse for even one of those things it means you havent suffered enough. And you coming here going on reddit to get a virtual hug from random people instead of actually breaking the loop and moving your ass it shows me that you havent suffered enough. Wait until its been 10 years and see how it will make you a vegetable. So let me tell you this: you either dont know what to do (i just told you now) or you are too weak right now, which i okay i was weak for 10 years and the i had to completely destroy myself until i woke up. Dont do the same mistake as me. My words are harsh but you need to finally snap out of it. And snapping out is a harsh brutal process. It wont happen by sombeody comforting you. I say this because i experienced this 10years and this message is what i woulf personally liked to hear myself 10 years ago…..""",2,1746684897.0,dpdr,1,1.0,False

I'm 27m, turning 28 next week, and the world around me worries me. I've never had a knack for making friends, and what few I did have abandoned me when I left Christianity about 4 years ago. 

Since then, I have lived every single day of my life completely alone. My days off are spent in total isolation, despite my best efforts. I walk every day, I go to coffee shops and bars, and I like to think I'm very active and social at work, but ids been to no avail. For further context, I moved out of state seven months ago, seeking like-minded people, but I am still entirely friendless. I truly believe now that there's just something wrong with me, something repugnant and awful that has damned me to a life of isolation,

1khj6oh,https://i.redd.it/3xanmdlu2ize1.jpeg,What makes a portfolio stand out in motion design?,"
(Spoiler: It’s not just sparkles and sound effects)


You ever see a motion design portfolio so good, you question your entire career?

Like, “Wow, I didn’t know After Effects could do THAT,” and also, “Why does my reel look like a PowerPoint got into a car accident?”

Let’s fix that.

Because in the world of motion design, a standout portfolio isn’t about having the most effects—it’s about telling the best story (and not giving your viewers a seizure in the process).


---

Heading 1: “Clarity is the New Cool”

Or: Why your portfolio shouldn’t need a decoder ring

Let’s be real. If your reel starts with 17 glitch transitions, 3 lens flares, and one random CGI goat… clients aren’t impressed—they’re confused.

They don’t want to feel like they just watched a trailer for an indie horror film.

Tip: Open strong. Show what you do and why it matters. Give each piece space to breathe. You're not editing a TikTok for a sugar-rushed raccoon.


---

Heading 2: “Your Reel Is Not a Dumping Ground”

This isn’t Storage Wars: Motion Design Edition

Here’s a fun game: go watch your own reel and count how many clips you added just because you were “proud of the lighting.”

Now cut half of them.

Great portfolios are curated, not crammed. It’s not a buffet—it's a chef’s tasting menu. Serve only your finest, not the cold spaghetti you made during that tutorial binge in 2020.


---

Heading 3: “Show Your Role—Don’t Roll Credits”

You did what on that animation? Be specific.

Too many reels just slap the logo on and hope the client assumes you did everything but invent the software.

Clients aren’t psychic. Be clear:

“I did the animation”

“I storyboarded this”

“I drank 5 coffees and stayed up ‘til 4 AM keyframing this scene”


Own your part. Transparency = Trust. Trust = Booked Projects.
Simple math.


---

Heading 4: “Make It Feel Like You”

Are you a human or a plugin pack?

Everyone’s got smooth transitions. Everyone’s got liquid blobs.
What they don’t have… is your weird humor, your unique vibe, your voice.

If your reel feels like it could’ve been made by AI with a Red Bull addiction, it’s time to human it up.

Show personality. Tell mini-stories. Add titles that aren’t just “Client Work 2023.” Try “How I Made This Ad Look 10x Cooler Than It Should’ve.”


---

Heading 5: “Keep It Tight. No, Tighter.”

This ain’t a Netflix series—it’s a pitch

Your reel shouldn’t last longer than a microwave burrito.
60–90 seconds is the sweet spot. After that, people start scrolling, emailing, or questioning their life choices.

End with your best work. Not that “experimental flaming emoji thing” you made during your abstract phase.


---

Mic Drop Conclusion:

Your portfolio should say:
“I know what I’m doing. I know who I am. And yes—I can make your brand look sexier than it deserves.”

Remember, in motion design, style attracts attention—but clarity, personality, and purpose are what get you hired.


---

Call to Action:

Think your portfolio stands out? Drop it in the comments—I’ll send you a gif reaction.
Or better yet, post your biggest portfolio regret so we can laugh and learn together.

Let’s keep those reels spinning, not spiraling.

I’m currently using the Timemore C3 ESP which does a good job with the pressurised portafilter and the Aeropress.

Three years. One thousand and ninety-five days of trying to be the perfect wife, and this was my reward divorce papers on our anniversary.

I stared at Stefan's perfect signature on the last page, the ink still fresh. He must have signed them this morning, probably right after I'd left that stupid handmade card on his desk. The one I'd spent hours making, like a fool who still believed in fairy tales.

The anniversary card I made for my husband Stefan still sat on the kitchen counter, untouched. Three years of marriage summed up in a handmade gesture he couldn't even bother to open. I'd spent hours on it last night, writing words I thought mattered.

My coffee had gone cold. Funny how you notice small things when your world is falling apart.

""Sign here. And here."" Stefan's voice was distant, businesslike. He'd laid out the divorce papers like contracts at one of his meetings, sticky tabs marking each signature line. ""The highlighted sections need initials.""

My hands wouldn't stop shaking. ""You're doing this today? On our anniversary?""

""Camille."" He sighed, that familiar sound of disappointment I'd heard so many times before. ""There's no point dragging this out.""

The morning sun streamed through our kitchen windows, catching the diamond on my finger. Three carats, princess cut, picked out by his mother. ""Not your style, dear, but it's what a Rodriguez wife should wear,"" she'd said at the time. Like everything else in my life, it had never really been mine.

""Is there someone else?""

The question hung in the air between us. Stefan straightened his tie, Italian silk, the blue one I'd given him for Christmas. ""Yes.""

One word. That's all it took to erase three years of trying to be perfect.

""How long?""

""Two months."" He wouldn't meet my eyes. ""She came back to town and...""

""Two months,"" I repeated. All those late nights at the office. The missed dinners. The way he'd stopped kissing me goodbye in the mornings. ""Were you ever going to tell me? Or just keep lying until the papers were ready?""

""I didn't want to hurt you.""

A laugh bubbled up, harsh, unfamiliar. ""That's thoughtful of you.""

My hand knocked against my coffee mug, sending it crashing to the floor. Dark liquid spread across the pristine tiles, staining the grout I'd scrubbed on hands and knees last week because his mother was coming to visit.

""Let me get that..."" Stefan reached for the paper towels.

""Don't."" My voice cracked. ""Just... don't pretend to care now.""

I bent to pick up the broken pieces. A photo slipped from between the divorce papers, landing face-up in the spilled coffee.

The world stopped.

I knew that smile. Those eyes. That perfectly poised expression that had haunted every family photo since I was twelve.

""Rose?"" My sister's name tasted like poison. ""Your first love was Rose?""

Stefan's silence said everything.

Memories hit like punches to the gut. Rose helping me pick out my wedding dress. Rose giving toasts at our engagement party. Rose calling every week to check on my marriage, to give advice about keeping Stefan happy.

My adopted sister. My parents' golden child. The one they'd chosen to love.

""She never left town, did she?"" The pieces were falling into place. ""She's been here the whole time, waiting. Playing the supportive sister while you both laughed at stupid, naive Camille.""

""It wasn't like that."" Stefan ran his hands through his hair, that gesture I used to find endearing. ""We tried to fight it. But some people are just meant to...""

""If you say 'meant to be' I swear I'll throw this mug at your head."" My fingers tightened around the broken ceramic. ""How long were you together before? Before me?""

He shifted uncomfortably. ""Four years. Until she got the job offer in London.""

Four years. The same time I'd started dating Stefan. The same time Rose had suddenly become my biggest cheerleader, pushing me toward him.

""She set this up,"" I whispered. ""All of it. And I fell for every piece.""

""Camille, you're being dramatic. Rose cares about you.""

""Like she cared when she told my first boyfriend I was damaged goods? Or when she convinced my parents I was too unstable for college?"" The broken mug cut into my palm, but I barely felt it. ""She's been sabotaging me my whole life, and I kept making excuses because that's what good sisters do, right?""

Blood dripped onto the divorce papers. Stefan reached for my hand but I jerked away.

""Don't touch me."" I grabbed a dish towel, wrapping it around my palm. ""Where is she now? Waiting to comfort me through my divorce? Planning your next wedding?""

""She wanted to be here, but I thought it would be better...""

""Better?"" I laughed again, the sound edged with hysteria. ""Yes, you've both been so concerned with what's better for me. Such caring people.""

I picked up the pen, the Mont Blanc he'd given me on our first anniversary. The one Rose had helped him choose.

""Camille, wait. We should talk about this properly.""

I signed every page, my signature perfectly steady. Let them see I wasn't breaking. Let them think they'd won.

""I'm done talking."" I gathered my purse, the signed papers, Rose's photo. ""Done pretending. Done being the good sister, the perfect wife, the daughter who never complains.""

""Where are you going?""

""Away from you. Away from her. Away from everyone who thinks Camille Lewis is someone they can use and discard.""

My phone buzzed, Rose's smiling face lit up the screen. Right on cue, coming to play her part.

I declined the call and walked to the door. Behind me, Stefan called out, ""You can't just leave. We need to discuss arrangements, the house, the accounts...""

""You can have it all."" I turned to face him one last time. ""The house, the cars, the life you built on lies. I don't want anything that reminds me of either of you.""

""Camille, please...""

""Goodbye, Stefan."" I smiled, and something in my expression made him step back. ""Give Rose my love. Tell her thank you, actually.""

""For what?""

""For finally showing me the truth. About her, about you, about who I need to become.""

I walked out of that house, out of that life, leaving bloody fingerprints on the door handle. Let them try to erase those as easily as they'd erased me.

Three years of pretending to be someone I wasn't. Three years of swallowing pain and making excuses for people who never deserved my loyalty.

My phone buzzed again. Rose. Then my mother. Then Stefan. One by one, I blocked them all.

Every connection to the life I thought I had to live.

In my rearview mirror, I caught a glimpse of my reflection. Tears streaked my makeup, blood stained my dress, my hair had come loose from its perfect twist.

My Story:

I'm still reeling from my deportation to my home country last week. I had completed my Master's from a prestigious university in Chicago and was set to graduate on May 17, 2025. However, my dreams were shattered when my Optional Practical Training (OPT) application was denied due to late submission. I take full responsibility for my mistake, which was partly due to working illegally at a coffee shop to pay tuition fees and support my family.

During that time, my college was transitioning from Microsoft to Google, causing communication delays with my academic advisor. Despite my efforts to reach out, I procrastinated, and by the time I received the denial email from the USCIS about application denied, I had only three days left. My passion to work in the corporate sector in Chicago or New York seemed like a distant dream.

Desperate Measures:

I consulted lawyers and was advised to apply for another Master's program to regain my status. I got admitted to a new program, paid the deposit, and enrolled in classes. And all the information below was given by the new day 1 OPT college that i had applied for… they sent me instructions on my email on how to regain my student status by reentering the border, for your information they were other students who were doing the same thing, the agent of that college suggested me to call few numbers of the students who did the same process in the past successfully, and grab their  insights on how to do it ? However, my student SEVIS was inactive, and I had to cross the border to regain my status. I chose the Mexico border (Matamoros), which seemed like the easiest option. I flew to Texas, crossed into Mexico by the most common bridge used, and re-entered the US, hoping to resolve my situation.

Detention and Deportation:

Unfortunately, I was detained by border patrol, held for 50 days, and eventually deported. The conditions were harsh – no contact with family, inadequate food, and a plastic foil blanket in a cold detention cell for a few days, I was also questioned about working illegally at the coffee shop, and I cooperated fully.

Documents:

Upon release, I received several documents, including:

1. Notice and Order of Expedited Removal (212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) of the Immigration and Nationality Act)
2. Notice to Alien Ordered Removed/Departure Verification
3. Record of Persons Transferred (received in my home country)
4. Record of Sworn Statement in proceedings under section 235(b)(1) if the Act

Lessons Learned:

This experience has taught me the importance of following immigration rules and regulations. I'm sharing my story to help others avoid similar situations, i was looking at the positive sides of the situation and ignoring the negative sides. Keep in mind when you’re doing something this important… you have to take precautions and keep yourself in check. 

Hope:

What do i do to re-enter into the united states as soon as possible? How much time will it take ? And How much money do i have to spend for this process ? How do i apply for it? 

The ICE officers that escorted me from texas to new york said i have to apply for a pardon when i reach my home country…will that help me too ? How much time will it take ? And How much money do i have to spend for this process ? Will i be able to re-enter into the united states as soon as possible? And how do i apply for it ? 

Thank You !!!

While stationed overseas as a military spouse, I became very close friends with someone. We usually get along really well, but things took a turn last week.

About a week and a half ago, we had one of our usual ""girls' days""—something we often do on weekends to get out and have fun. I don’t have many close friends here, so our bond has meant a lot to me. It’s been hard connecting with other spouses on the same level.

During our outing, she mentioned she prefers not to go on girls’ trips with more than just me. She said our mutual friend overwhelms her, partly because both she and I have diagnosed ADD and tend to jump between topics. I always try to include her in conversations, even though she’s usually on her phone when the three of us hang out. I told her I completely understood and would make sure our outings were just the two of us going forward.

A few days later, she invited me over to vent and decompress. I was happy to be there for her. But then, she invited both me and our mutual friend to dinner that weekend, which felt confusing given our previous conversation. I wasn’t angry—just a bit thrown off. I decided to wait a couple of days before bringing it up so I could collect my thoughts.

That same night, she asked if I could help cook for 50 people—with less than 30 hours’ notice. I said I’d try to help, as my schedule was mostly open. The next morning, she texted saying she really needed coffee, so I brought her one. But I was feeling emotionally off that day—I'm diagnosed with ADD, PTSD, Bipolar II, and depression. She knows this. I don’t use it as an excuse, but sometimes I crash hard.

That day, I had one of those crashes. I decided to take a bath to calm down. I used a bath bomb, which triggered an asthma attack that led me to the hospital. My husband was away for work, so I had to handle everything on my own.

I texted her after I got home, explaining that I was having a rough day mentally and needed to stay home. I didn’t mention the asthma attack because I didn’t want to worry her. I apologized and suggested she ask others for help with the cooking. She said she had, but I didn’t see anything posted in the group chat, so I’m not sure.

She got upset and said she needed space to gather her thoughts so she wouldn't be harsh with me. I told her I understood. It's been a week since then. She also uninvited me from the dinner, which hurt.

A few days later, I heard from her husband that she’s upset because she feels I haven’t been there for her—which really stung. I’ve always tried to show up, even on hard days. I care about her deeply, and it hurts that she thinks otherwise.

Now I’m stuck. I want to respect her space, but I don’t know what to do or how to approach her if/when she reaches out.

Three years. One thousand and ninety-five days of trying to be the perfect wife, and this was my reward divorce papers on our anniversary.



I stared at Stefan's perfect signature on the last page, the ink still fresh. He must have signed them this morning, probably right after I'd left that stupid handmade card on his desk. The one I'd spent hours making, like a fool who still believed in fairy tales.



The anniversary card I made for my husband Stefan still sat on the kitchen counter, untouched. Three years of marriage summed up in a handmade gesture he couldn't even bother to open. I'd spent hours on it last night, writing words I thought mattered.



My coffee had gone cold. Funny how you notice small things when your world is falling apart.



""Sign here. And here."" Stefan's voice was distant, businesslike. He'd laid out the divorce papers like contracts at one of his meetings, sticky tabs marking each signature line. ""The highlighted sections need initials.""



My hands wouldn't stop shaking. ""You're doing this today? On our anniversary?""



""Camille."" He sighed, that familiar sound of disappointment I'd heard so many times before. ""There's no point dragging this out.""



The morning sun streamed through our kitchen windows, catching the diamond on my finger. Three carats, princess cut, picked out by his mother. ""Not your style, dear, but it's what a Rodriguez wife should wear,"" she'd said at the time. Like everything else in my life, it had never really been mine.



""Is there someone else?""



The question hung in the air between us. Stefan straightened his tie, Italian silk, the blue one I'd given him for Christmas. ""Yes.""



One word. That's all it took to erase three years of trying to be perfect.



""How long?""



""Two months."" He wouldn't meet my eyes. ""She came back to town and...""



""Two months,"" I repeated. All those late nights at the office. The missed dinners. The way he'd stopped kissing me goodbye in the mornings. ""Were you ever going to tell me? Or just keep lying until the papers were ready?""



""I didn't want to hurt you.""



A laugh bubbled up, harsh, unfamiliar. ""That's thoughtful of you.""



My hand knocked against my coffee mug, sending it crashing to the floor. Dark liquid spread across the pristine tiles, staining the grout I'd scrubbed on hands and knees last week because his mother was coming to visit.



""Let me get that..."" Stefan reached for the paper towels.



""Don't."" My voice cracked. ""Just... don't pretend to care now.""



I bent to pick up the broken pieces. A photo slipped from between the divorce papers, landing face-up in the spilled coffee.



The world stopped.



I knew that smile. Those eyes. That perfectly poised expression that had haunted every family photo since I was twelve.



""Rose?"" My sister's name tasted like poison. ""Your first love was Rose?""



Stefan's silence said everything.



Memories hit like punches to the gut. Rose helping me pick out my wedding dress. Rose giving toasts at our engagement party. Rose calling every week to check on my marriage, to give advice about keeping Stefan happy.



My adopted sister. My parents' golden child. The one they'd chosen to love.



""She never left town, did she?"" The pieces were falling into place. ""She's been here the whole time, waiting. Playing the supportive sister while you both laughed at stupid, naive Camille.""



""It wasn't like that."" Stefan ran his hands through his hair, that gesture I used to find endearing. ""We tried to fight it. But some people are just meant to...""



""If you say 'meant to be' I swear I'll throw this mug at your head."" My fingers tightened around the broken ceramic. ""How long were you together before? Before me?""



He shifted uncomfortably. ""Four years. Until she got the job offer in London.""



Four years. The same time I'd started dating Stefan. The same time Rose had suddenly become my biggest cheerleader, pushing me toward him.



""She set this up,"" I whispered. ""All of it. And I fell for every piece.""



""Camille, you're being dramatic. Rose cares about you.""



""Like she cared when she told my first boyfriend I was damaged goods? Or when she convinced my parents I was too unstable for college?"" The broken mug cut into my palm, but I barely felt it. ""She's been sabotaging me my whole life, and I kept making excuses because that's what good sisters do, right?""



Blood dripped onto the divorce papers. Stefan reached for my hand but I jerked away.



""Don't touch me."" I grabbed a dish towel, wrapping it around my palm. ""Where is she now? Waiting to comfort me through my divorce? Planning your next wedding?""



""She wanted to be here, but I thought it would be better...""



""Better?"" I laughed again, the sound edged with hysteria. ""Yes, you've both been so concerned with what's better for me. Such caring people.""



I picked up the pen, the Mont Blanc he'd given me on our first anniversary. The one Rose had helped him choose.



""Camille, wait. We should talk about this properly.""



I signed every page, my signature perfectly steady. Let them see I wasn't breaking. Let them think they'd won.



""I'm done talking."" I gathered my purse, the signed papers, Rose's photo. ""Done pretending. Done being the good sister, the perfect wife, the daughter who never complains.""



""Where are you going?""



""Away from you. Away from her. Away from everyone who thinks Camille Lewis is someone they can use and discard.""



My phone buzzed, Rose's smiling face lit up the screen. Right on cue, coming to play her part.



I declined the call and walked to the door. Behind me, Stefan called out, ""You can't just leave. We need to discuss arrangements, the house, the accounts...""



""You can have it all."" I turned to face him one last time. ""The house, the cars, the life you built on lies. I don't want anything that reminds me of either of you.""



""Camille, please...""



""Goodbye, Stefan."" I smiled, and something in my expression made him step back. ""Give Rose my love. Tell her thank you, actually.""



""For what?""



""For finally showing me the truth. About her, about you, about who I need to become.""



I walked out of that house, out of that life, leaving bloody fingerprints on the door handle. Let them try to erase those as easily as they'd erased me.



Three years of pretending to be someone I wasn't. Three years of swallowing pain and making excuses for people who never deserved my loyalty.



My phone buzzed again. Rose. Then my mother. Then Stefan. One by one, I blocked them all.



Every connection to the life I thought I had to live.



In my rearview mirror, I caught a glimpse of my reflection. Tears streaked my makeup, blood stained my dress, my hair had come loose from its perfect twist.

How to proceed?","I dated someone in my cohort on a casual basis for approximately 5 months, before coming to the realization that I cannot manage casual with this individual, as she seemingly alternated emotional intensity and aloofness in a way that I found confusing. I also had some reservations as to our compatibility early on, but never firmly acted on them (despite alluding to them regularly). Approximately three months ago, the alternating intimacy and distance culminated in my inquiring as to whether she saw us moving toward anything more solidified in the near future. Her answer was vague and evasive, so I announced a desire to distance myself.

I felt confident in the decision: she was at a place where she wanted to focus on herself and have fun, and I wanted to find commitment in the next couple of years, so our goals were simply incompatible. Plus, she had taken an interest in other people, as she’d gone on at least one other date that she confirmed and appeared to flirt pretty heavily with others, and, disenchanted with her roving eye, I’d pursued a few other possibilities myself (albeit reluctantly: she had my heart, ultimately.) We both seemed fine with it ending. 

However, after inviting me to a sit-down coffee in the aftermath of that “breakup” conversation, she came over to my apartment and we were intimate, the lone difference being some awkward conversation in between bouts of activity during which we both claimed to feel “conflicted.” What I recall her asking was whether I might “be patient.” Because I felt utterly spellbound by her, despite my rational misgivings, I clung to that seeming indication that with a brief interlude in which she attended to her mental health, we might pursue something legitimate in the years to come.

After that evening together, all signs of continued affection seemed to evaporate, with her ignoring me altogether when we saw one another, making passive-aggressive comments toward me in the company of our colleagues, and generally behaving in ways that were strikingly discourteous, which I found confounding, given that we’d apparently agreed to remain friendly. 

I began to give up on the prospect of friendship after her no-showing a couple of events I’d invited her to without so much as a text explaining her inability to make it. The last straw was her agreeing to hangout after a departmental function then bowing out as soon as the event wrapped. She sent what seemed like a rather half-hearted “sorry” text afterwards, but I was tired of trying to keep up some semblance of an amicable connection, so I didn’t acknowledge it for some time. After a couple of weeks, I figured I was being childish, so I sent a simple “no worries,” to which no reply ever arrived (I didn’t expect one.) I just knew she had a history of being ghosted by former intimates, and I couldn’t bear inflicting that upon her, as disappointed as I was in the whole situation.

Days later, I noticed that I’d been added to a group chat by her, as she was organizing a hangout for our cohort. I was surprised to be included, but was touched by the gesture, and took it as a sign that there were no hard feelings and we could be collegial in the future. I woke the next morning to see that she’d removed me overnight, despite my not interacting with the chat in some egregious fashion (or at all). Given that this was on IG, everyone would be able to see that I’d been singled out for removal, so this felt like a particularly aggressive bid to shame me (for what I can only guess) in the eyes of our peers and ostracize me from a small, tight-knit community essential for my professional development over the next several years. I was shocked that she would do something this public and emphatic, and ever since I’ve been wondering not only why she’d do this, but how this might affect my reputation at the university. I deactivated that account in embarrassment, but resisted the urge to block her on other platforms. I don’t know if she deleted or blocked my phone number, and I won’t be reaching out to verify. I now know I can’t assume a neutral reception, and that I didn’t know her as well as I thought, this action eroding much of my remaining goodwill toward her.

I’m rather demoralized, as I’ve seemingly moved in the space of a few months from having a burgeoning partnership (or, maybe, as I eventually came to view it, a dead-end, draining situationship) with someone for whom I cared deeply to having an apparent “adversary” in this very same person, someone interested in interfering with my career and social life, insofar as they intersect.

I guess what I’m looking for is, maybe, some insight into why she’d do something like this, and what, if anything, I ought to do when everyone is back on campus, in the event that this is what I fear it to be (part of a campaign of ostracism, for reasons utterly unknown to me, since I was under the impression she couldn’t care any less about me.)

1khixl1,https://www.reddit.com/r/PreCervicalCancer/comments/1khixl1/long_little_leep_story_positive_experience/,Long little LEEP story (positive experience),"I (35F) have been lurking in this sub since my diagnosis (HPV 18/45 and CIN II) in March. My obgyn suggested a LEEP procedure, which I signed up for 6 weeks after my colposcopy. 

Yesterday was my LEEP appointment. I don't have insurance so I opted for local, which, thankfully, I was cut a deal and it was reasonably priced. 

Like all of us, I rode a rollercoaster of emotions up until my appointment. I was scared and going crazy with the overthinking and questioning and horror stories and I was just beyond ready to get it over with. The way I saw it, once it was done I was one step closer to some real answers, instead of the extreme ones I kept making up in my head.

To my relief, my LEEP experience was exactly what has been described here... And way less intense than I imagined. 

Some notable highlights:

1. Since I opted for local, I was nervous about the numbing needle. I saw it on the table and that sucker was huge, but to my complete surprise I ended up not feeling a damn thing. My heart didn't race at all (which I was also nervous about since I had coffee earlier that morning, and my anxiety causes me to overthink the way things can interact with each other sometimes). In fact, the only reason I knew the shoot even happened was because my legs began to shake, just as everyone here had described. But they only shook for a few minutes, and nothing more jerky than they would from a slight shiver caused by a cool breeze. 

2. Yep. The smell. I've seen a toss up on how many people could actually smell the burning on here, so one of the first things I asked was if it was going to get stinky. The nurses checking me in confirmed that it was. 

Which leads me to a quirky side story.

-- My obgyn had no assistance with this procedure. Idk if that's standard, but I had two people check me in with my weight and blood pressure, and I assumed at least one of them would stay, if even on standby, to help with the LEEP. But yeah, no. Just me and my obgyn. Nothing wrong with that, it's clearly standard at that office. But my obgyn.. couldn't figure out how to turn the LEEP machine on. Like, at all lol. It was kinda presented to me as someone else used it before him and messed with the settings, kind of like when you let someone drive your car, and you have to reset everything when you get back in. 

Except he couldn't get it to reset. 
  
I kid you not, it took 10 min and two other people to come in and help him figure it out. So, while they were all pondering and debating and touching buttons, I had all the time in the world to try not to take this as a sign that maybeee I shouldn't go through with this, and instead involuntarily study these machines that they were working so hard to turn on. That's when I noticed the one closest to me read something along the lines of SUPER TURBO SUPERCHARGED SURGICAL SMOKE VACUUM 5000. 

And. You. All. 

After months of lurking and reading about what to expect from a LEEP,  that's when it really hit me that, oh... wait. My cervix is really about to be thermally *burned* off. Of course there's going to be a smell. And smoke. Because it's fucking burning. How that never truly sunk in before that very moment, I'll never understand. And sure enough, once everything got up and running (the problem with the LEEP machine being the age old 'did you turn it off and turn it back on again' .... Which my obgyn did, but didn't wait long enough before turning it back on. Something I admittedly would probably have done myself lol) he showed me the sound the vacuum would make. I braced myself and thought it was going to sound scary. But, despite the scary name, the machine really only ended up sounding just like a small vacuum. Nothing terrible or loud or big. Just a quieter vaccum noise, akin to a little dirt devil.  

That being said, the hose to that small vaccum wouldn't quite cooperate during the procedure. Remember, my obgyn had no assistants. After a couple slips I ended up gently holding the hose in place across my stomach while he did his thing down there. Teamwork, baby! 

And the smell? For me, it was a pretty strong, even with the vaccum, and closely resembled that of burning hair. So really, nothing that I've absolutely never smelled before. It was by no means pleasant, but also not as jarring as I imagined the smell of a burning organ to be. 

3. Pain. The actual LEEP procedure wasn't painful at all. It just felt really, really warm. He went in 3 times. After the third time it was tip-toeing to eh, this may be starting to get uncomfortable. But right as I was beginning to think that, there was a small pinch and he started patching things up. The pinch wasn't painful either, just a surprise. 

And that was it. 

The whole process lasted maybeeee 5 min? Hell could be as short as 3.

Honestly, it took longer to for him figure out how to turn the machine on than it took for my entire procedure. 

4. After. The heat during the procedure actually turned into a lingering burning sensation that lasted about 4 hours afterwards, but it was totally tolerable. Think discomfort level of a bad yeast infection perhaps? Annoying, but I wouldn't say it was painful per-se. I did nap for 4 hours when I got home after I got a little lunch in me. I called it a night shortly after I woke up from that nap and slept almost another 10 hours straight. 

I'm not even 48 hours post LEEP and I've yet to have any discharge or bleeding or smell. By everything I've read I know that's all coming, but for right now all I am is a little more tired than usual with some very small twinges of cramps here and there. So, not bad at all. Let's hope it stays easy that way!

....

One more thing to note. When I asked what my restrictions were, my OBGYN told me ""None!"" He said to expect some spotting and cramps and colorful discharge, and no sex and not to insert anything into my vagina for 4 weeks, but other than that I was gold. He said I was clear to go drink a margarita with the girls immediately if I wanted to. The same day of the procedure! I found this rather odd, as I've read so many things about no baths, exercise, heavy lifting, hell even walking too much for up to 6 weeks after a LEEP. But he was really nonchalant about the whole recovery. I'm definitely going to err on the side of caution and take it as easy as possible for as long as I can.

I'm not much into gambling but I like the atmosphere. More important are nearby quick bites, dining, coffee, drinks.

Where can I stay for cheap? Any great deals happening to lure people to Vegas right now?",1,1746683839.0,vegas,0,1.0,False

1khitwa,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1khitwa/my_best_friend_hasnt_spoken_to_me_in_a_week/,My best friend hasn't spoken to me in a week...,"While stationed overseas as a military spouse, I became very close friends with someone. We usually get along really well, but things took a turn last week.

About a week and a half ago, we had one of our usual ""girls' days""—something we often do on weekends to get out and have fun. I don’t have many close friends here, so our bond has meant a lot to me. It’s been hard connecting with other spouses on the same level.

During our outing, she mentioned she prefers not to go on girls’ trips with more than just me. She said our mutual friend overwhelms her, partly because both she and I have diagnosed ADD and tend to jump between topics. I always try to include her in conversations, even though she’s usually on her phone when the three of us hang out. I told her I completely understood and would make sure our outings were just the two of us going forward.

A few days later, she invited me over to vent and decompress. I was happy to be there for her. But then, she invited both me and our mutual friend to dinner that weekend, which felt confusing given our previous conversation. I wasn’t angry—just a bit thrown off. I decided to wait a couple of days before bringing it up so I could collect my thoughts.

That same night, she asked if I could help cook for 50 people—with less than 30 hours’ notice. I said I’d try to help, as my schedule was mostly open. The next morning, she texted saying she really needed coffee, so I brought her one. But I was feeling emotionally off that day—I'm diagnosed with ADD, PTSD, Bipolar II, and depression. She knows this. I don’t use it as an excuse, but sometimes I crash hard.

That day, I had one of those crashes. I decided to take a bath to calm down. I used a bath bomb, which triggered an asthma attack that led me to the hospital. My husband was away for work, so I had to handle everything on my own.

I texted her after I got home, explaining that I was having a rough day mentally and needed to stay home. I didn’t mention the asthma attack because I didn’t want to worry her. I apologized and suggested she ask others for help with the cooking. She said she had, but I didn’t see anything posted in the group chat, so I’m not sure.

She got upset and said she needed space to gather her thoughts so she wouldn't be harsh with me. I told her I understood. It's been a week since then. She also uninvited me from the dinner, which hurt.

A few days later, I heard from her husband that she’s upset because she feels I haven’t been there for her—which really stung. I’ve always tried to show up, even on hard days. I care about her deeply, and it hurts that she thinks otherwise.

Now I’m stuck. I want to respect her space, but I don’t know what to do or how to approach her if/when she reaches out. She and our mutual friend are the only people I’m really close to here, far from my family. I’m thinking maybe I should continue giving her space and wait, but I don’t know how to talk to her when the time comes.

## What is TrueNorth Capital?

**TrueNorth Capital** is an online trading platform that combines **automated trading tools** with manual trading capabilities. It’s designed for users who want access to global markets like **cryptocurrencies, forex, commodities, and stocks** — all in one place.

What caught my attention is how it’s marketed as beginner-friendly, yet it still includes features that more experienced traders would appreciate. Think real-time market data, customizable alerts, and a clean interface that doesn’t make you feel like you need a finance degree to use it.

From what I’ve gathered, it’s not just another flashy trading app. There’s some real functionality here, especially if you’re looking to get in and start trading without jumping through hoops.

## Who Created TrueNorth Capital?

Now this is one of those platforms where the creators like to stay in the shadows. There’s **no direct public info about the founders**, which is pretty common in this space. Similar platforms like Bitcoin Code and Immediate Edge also don’t make the development team known.

While that might raise an eyebrow, it’s not always a red flag. Many platforms opt for anonymity to avoid legal or competitive issues. What matters more is how the platform operates and whether it follows through on its promises.

In terms of design and functionality, it feels like it was built by people who understand trading — not just coders trying to make a quick buck. The interface is intuitive, and the tools are practical, which makes me think it’s backed by folks with real market experience.

## How Does TrueNorth Capital Work?

TrueNorth Capital works by connecting users to a **network of brokers** and providing both automated and manual trading options. After signing up and depositing funds, you can either:

- Set up **automated trading** strategies (ideal if you don’t want to monitor markets all day)
- Or trade manually using real-time data and analysis tools

It uses **AI-driven algorithms** to scan the market and identify potential trades. If you choose the auto mode, it can place trades on your behalf based on the parameters you set. If you prefer control, you can use its tools to make informed decisions yourself.

It’s kind of like having a smart assistant that can either take the wheel or sit shotgun and give you tips while you drive.

## TrueNorth Capital Pros and Cons

Let’s cut to the chase — here’s what’s good and what’s not-so-good about TrueNorth Capital.

**Pros:**
- ✅ **Easy to use** for beginners

So yeah, you can literally trade from your couch, your office, or while waiting in line for coffee.

## TrueNorth Capital – Supported Countries

TrueNorth Capital is available in most countries around the world. That said, it does **restrict access in a few regions** due to regulatory reasons. Common restricted countries include:

- The United States
- Canada
- North Korea
- Iran

If you’re unsure whether your country is supported, the safest bet is to try the signup process. If it lets you proceed, you’re probably good to go.

## TrueNorth Capital – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

One of the features I really liked is the **real-time market analysis**. It pulls live data from multiple exchanges and sources to help you make better trading decisions. Whether you’re automating your trades or doing it manually, having accurate and current info is crucial.

The platform gives you access to charts, trends, and indicators that update in real time — which is kind of like having your own Bloomberg terminal, minus the $20k price tag.

### User-Friendly Interface

TrueNorth Capital shines with its **clean and intuitive layout**. Everything is where you expect it to be, and you don’t need a tutorial to figure out how to place a trade or check your balance.

Even if you’ve never traded before, the platform walks you through the basics without overwhelming you. The design is more “modern fintech” and less “Wall Street spreadsheet.”

### Mobile Accessibility

There’s no app, but the **mobile web experience is solid**. I was able to make trades, check alerts, and monitor my portfolio from my phone without any issues.

The interface adapts well to smaller screens and keeps all the core functionality intact. So if you’re someone who likes to trade on the go, this gets a thumbs up.

### Customizable Alerts

You can set up **custom alerts** for price changes, market conditions, or trade execution. This is super helpful if you don’t want to be glued to your screen 24/7.

Alerts can come via email or push notifications, depending on your preferences. It’s a small touch, but it makes a big difference in staying on top of your trades.

### Multiple Asset Trading

Another strong point is the **diversity of trading options**. You’re not just limited to crypto — you can also trade:

- Forex pairs
- Commodities like gold and oil
- Stocks and indices

This makes it easier to diversify your portfolio and try different strategies without jumping between platforms.

## Is TrueNorth Capital a Scam?

This is the big question, right? Based on my experience and research, **TrueNorth Capital doesn’t appear to be a scam**. It functions as advertised, offers real tools, and doesn’t have any shady hidden fees.

That said, it’s **not regulated**, so you should always approach with caution — especially when trading large sums. The lack of transparency about its creators is a minus, but not necessarily a dealbreaker given how many platforms operate similarly.

Use the demo account first. Test everything. And don’t invest more than you’re willing to lose — standard trading rules apply.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on TrueNorth Capital?

The minimum deposit to get started is **$250**. This is pretty standard for trading platforms in this space — it’s the same for Bitcoin Era, Immediate Edge, and similar services.

Once you deposit, those funds are yours to trade with. There are no fees just for opening the account.

### TrueNorth Capital Customer Support

Support is available **24/7**, and you can reach them through:

- **Live chat**
- **Email**
- **Phone**

I tested the live chat and got a response in under two minutes, which is honestly better than I expected. The rep was helpful and didn’t give me canned answers.

## How do you start trading on TrueNorth Capital?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Go to the official TrueNorth Capital site and fill in the basic form — name, email, and phone number. It takes less than 2 minutes.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

Once you're registered, you’ll get connected to a broker. You’ll need to **verify your identity** (standard KYC stuff), then make your first deposit of at least $250.

### Step 3: Start Trading

You can now use the demo mode to explore the platform or jump straight into live trading. Choose between **manual or automated** strategies depending on your comfort level.

## How to Delete a TrueNorth Capital Account?

Want to close your account? You can request deletion by contacting support via email or live chat. They’ll walk you through the steps and make sure your funds are withdrawn before the account is shut down.

It’s not a one-click process, but it’s pretty straightforward and doesn’t involve any sketchy hoops.

## The Verdict

So, is TrueNorth Capital worth trying? **Yeah, I think so.** It offers a solid mix of features for beginners and intermediate traders, with enough automation to make things simple without dumbing it down.

I am a 25 years old athlete whose been a black coffee drinker for the past 10 years (about 3 cups a day) and decided to quit caffeine 3 weeks ago to see if it can improve my overall performance.

In the first 5 days I did have some withdrawal symptoms including headaches and fatigue but I was alright with it. One thing I noticed in the first week was that my dreams got more vivid and intense and my sleep was deeper.

Now I feel like I got used to being off of caffeine and I barely notice any difference from drinking coffee… I feel the same level of tiredness during the day but the only difference is that I can deal with this tiredness better… my sleep feels like it’s back to what it was while drinking coffee.

I am wondering if more people are having the same feeling like me, and whether it would be beneficial for me to continue without consuming caffeine or not…
I don’t really have the urge to drink coffee anymore but I wonder if more benefits should appear if I keep my self from consuming it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When searching for a home that offers both comfort and utility, a barndominium presents a compelling option. This unique structure combines the robust, durable characteristics of a barn with the cozy living quarters of a traditional home. Here’s why choosing a barndominium for sale with living quarters might be the best decision you make for your lifestyle.

### Spacious Interiors

One significant advantage of a barndominium is its generous space. The open floor plans are perfect for families or individuals looking for plenty of room. With fewer walls than conventional homes, barndominiums provide flexibility in room usage. You can design your living and working spaces to flow seamlessly into one another, making it ideal for entertaining guests or enjoying time with family.

### Affordable Construction

Building or buying a barndominium typically offers a cost-effective solution to homeownership. With materials often sourced locally and a straightforward construction process, you can save both time and money. This affordability means that you can invest more in customizing your living quarters to reflect your style and needs.

### Energy Efficiency

Barndominiums are designed with energy efficiency in mind. Their metal siding and insulation help regulate indoor temperature, reducing the need for heating and cooling. This can lead to lower energy bills, making living in a barndominium not only convenient but also budget-friendly. With advancements in building technology, modern barndominiums can also incorporate solar panels, providing sustainable energy solutions.

### Versatile Use

The versatility of a barndominium is unmatched. Many homeowners choose this structure for various purposes, whether it’s a family residence, a hobby farm, or a workspace. If you love crafting, woodworking, or running a small business, the spacious living quarters with combined work areas can be particularly beneficial. The ability to transition between work and leisure without the need for a daily commute can enhance your work-life balance.

### Rural Charm and Modern Comfort

For those seeking a rural lifestyle without sacrificing modern amenities, a barndominium hits the sweet spot. Many feature modern kitchens, comfortable living rooms, and spacious bedrooms while also being surrounded by nature. Imagine waking up to wide-open spaces, fresh air, and the beauty of rural landscapes, all while enjoying the comforts of a contemporary home.

### Customization Opportunities

Personalizing your living quarters in a barndominium is not only easy but also encouraged. With its unique construction, you have the freedom to design your space according to your preferences. This includes selecting materials, colors, and layouts that resonate with your style. Whether you prefer a rustic farmhouse look or a sleek, modern aesthetic, the potential for customization is vast.

### Integrated Outdoor Living

Your barndominium can seamlessly incorporate outdoor spaces, such as decks and patios. This connection to the outdoors allows for enjoyable gatherings with family and friends, whether you’re hosting a summer barbecue or enjoying a quiet evening under the stars. The expansive land often surrounding barndominiums provides ample opportunities for outdoor activities, gardening, or simply relaxing in nature.

### A Great Investment

Buying a barndominium is not just a lifestyle choice; it can also be a smart financial investment. This type of property often retains its value well due to its unique charm and versatility. As more people seek non-traditional housing options, the demand for barndominiums is growing. Therefore, if you decide to sell in the future, you may find that your investment appreciates significantly.

Ultimately, a barndominium for sale with living quarters offers a harmonious blend of comfort and utility. From spacious interiors and affordable construction to energy efficiency and customization opportunities, there’s no doubt that barndominiums can meet various lifestyle needs. With their modern comforts, rural charm, and impressive versatility, barndominiums are worth considering for your next home purchase.

Tips for Designing Your Ideal Barndominium Living Space: Maximizing Comfort and Functionality
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Designing your ideal living space in a barndominium is an exciting endeavor. The charm of a barndominium combines rustic style with modern practicality. Whether you’re looking for a cozy retreat or a functional family home, maximizing comfort and functionality is key to creating a space that you’ll enjoy for years to come. Here are some helpful tips to keep in mind as you embark on this journey.

### Understand Your Space

Before you dive into design choices, take the time to understand the layout and dimensions of your barndominium. Knowing how much space you have will help you make better choices regarding furniture and decor.

- **Measure Each Area:** Accurate measurements can prevent you from buying furniture that doesn't fit.
- **Consider Flow:** Think about how you'll move through the space. The layout should promote easy access between rooms.
- **Natural Light:** Make the most of windows and doors. Positioning living areas near natural light sources can create an inviting atmosphere.

### Choose a Color Palette

Your color palette plays a crucial role in setting the mood of your barndominium. Light colors can make a space feel larger, while darker shades might create a cozier feel. Consider the following when selecting colors:

- **Neutral Tones:** Shades like whites, beiges, and grays can serve as a great base.
- **Accent Colors:** Incorporate deeper hues for furniture or decor to create focal points.
- **Consistency:** Keep a consistent palette throughout the space for a cohesive look.

### Functional Furniture Choices

Furniture in a barndominium should be both stylish and practical. Selecting the right pieces can enhance comfort while maximizing functionality.

- **Multi-Functional Pieces:** Look for sofas that convert to beds or coffee tables with storage. These can save space and serve multiple purposes.
- **Comfort First:** Ensure that chairs and sofas are comfortable enough for relaxation and entertaining.
- **Material Matters:** Invest in durable materials that can withstand wear and tear while maintaining style.

### Incorporate Smart Storage Solutions

Living in a barndominium often means dealing with an open floor plan. Keeping everything organized is essential for maintaining a tidy home.

- **Built-in Furnishings:** Use built-in shelves or cabinets to save space and keep your items neatly stored.
- **Under-Bed Storage:** Utilize the area under beds for storing seasonal items or extra linens.
- **Vertical Space:** Don’t forget to use vertical space for storage. Tall bookshelves can store a lot without occupying much floor area.

### Add Personal Touches

Transform your barndominium into a reflection of your personality by adding personal touches. Art and decor can make your space feel welcoming and uniquely yours.

- **Family Photos:** Hang family pictures in a gallery style to create a warm atmosphere.
- **Local Artwork:** Incorporate pieces from local artists to give your space a community feel.
- **Sentimental Items:** Include items that have special meaning to you and your family, such as heirlooms or travel souvenirs.

### Embrace Outdoor Living

The natural surroundings of a barndominium can be an extension of your living space. Consider designing outdoor areas that enhance your comfort and functionality.

- **Outdoor Seating:** Create a cozy outdoor seating area for relaxation or entertaining.
- **Gardening Space:** If you enjoy gardening, designate a small area for plants and flowers.
- **Defined Areas:** Use outdoor rugs or lighting to demarcate different areas on a patio or deck.

With careful planning and thoughtful design choices, your barndominium can be a perfect blend of comfort and utility. Utilize these tips as a guide, and don’t hesitate to let your creativity shine. Finding the right balance between style and functionality will ultimately lead to a living space you’ll cherish.

### Conclusion

Choosing a barndominium for sale with living quarters truly offers a unique blend of comfort and utility that appeals to modern homeowners. These structures combine the charm of rustic living with the conveniences of contemporary design, making them an ideal choice for families looking to embrace a more functional lifestyle. As you explore the features of a barndominium, consider how elements such as open floor plans, ample storage options, and energy-efficient materials can enhance your living experience.

Designing your ideal barndominium requires thoughtful consideration of both aesthetics and functionality.

## What is RiseETH?

RiseETH is an **automated cryptocurrency trading platform** designed to make crypto trading more accessible to beginners while still being powerful enough for experienced traders. It uses machine learning algorithms and real-time data analysis to help users make better trading decisions—or even automate trades completely.

It’s basically a smart assistant for your crypto journey. You can either let it take the wheel or use it as a supercharged toolkit to stay ahead of the market. And unlike some clunky trading platforms, RiseETH actually looks and feels modern. No confusing dashboards or outdated UI.

## Who Created RiseETH?

The creators of RiseETH are... kind of a mystery.

There’s no Elon Musk-style public figure behind it, which is pretty common for platforms in this niche. From what I could gather, it was developed by a group of **financial tech professionals and crypto enthusiasts** who wanted to make trading easier and more efficient for regular people.

While the lack of a named founder might raise a few eyebrows, it doesn’t automatically mean the platform is shady. Other legit platforms like Bitcoin Era and Immediate Edge operate the same way.

### [🔥 Start Trading with RiseETH Today](https://tinyurl.com/4esh6wc3)
## How Does RiseETH Work?

At its core, RiseETH uses **AI-powered algorithms** to monitor and analyze cryptocurrency markets in real time. It looks for patterns, trends, and potential entry/exit points—then either notifies you or executes trades automatically, depending on your settings.

Here’s a simplified view of how it works:

- **You sign up and deposit funds.**
- **Choose your trading settings** (manual or automated).
- **The algorithm scans the market 24/7** and reacts faster than any human could.
- **You monitor progress, adjust strategies**, or sit back and let it do its thing.

It’s not magic, but it’s definitely helpful—especially for people who don’t have the time or experience to analyze charts all day.

## RiseETH Pros and Cons

Let’s be real, no platform is perfect. But RiseETH does a solid job of checking most boxes.

**Pros:**

- ✅ Easy to use, even for beginners
- ✅ Real-time market analysis
- ✅ Supports multiple cryptocurrencies
- ✅ Works on mobile and desktop
- ✅ Customizable trading alerts
- ✅ Demo account to practice

**Cons:**

- ❌ Not officially regulated
- ❌ Requires a $250 minimum deposit
- ❌ No native mobile app (browser-based only)

Still, compared to some other platforms I’ve tried, RiseETH feels more polished and responsive.

One of the things I like most about RiseETH is the device flexibility. You don’t need a fancy rig or high-end PC to use it.

You can access RiseETH on:

- **Desktop computers** (Windows, macOS)
- **Laptops**
- **Tablets**
- **Smartphones** (iOS and Android browsers)

There’s no standalone app (yet), but the mobile browser version is fast, responsive, and doesn’t feel like a stripped-down version of the desktop site.

## RiseETH – Supported Countries

RiseETH is available in most countries around the world, with a few exceptions due to local regulations.

Supported regions include:

- **United States**

## RiseETH – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

This is where RiseETH shines. It constantly monitors the market using machine learning to identify trends and potential trading opportunities.

You basically get a **mini Wall Street analyst** working for you 24/7. And the best part? You don’t need to stare at charts all day—RiseETH does the heavy lifting.

### User-Friendly Interface

I’ve seen some trading platforms that look like they were built in 2005. RiseETH is not one of them.

The UI is clean, intuitive, and doesn’t overwhelm you with info. Whether you’re a newbie or a veteran trader, you’ll find it easy to navigate.

### Mobile Accessibility

While there’s no app, the mobile browser version works really well. You can check your trades, make adjustments, or monitor alerts right from your phone.

Perfect for those of us who like to trade while waiting in line for coffee.

### Customizable Alerts

You can set up alerts for price movements, trade execution, and more. This is great if you want to stay informed without being glued to your screen.

Alerts can be set via **email or SMS** depending on your preferences.

### Multiple Asset Trading

RiseETH isn’t just for Bitcoin. You can trade:

- **Ethereum**
- **Litecoin**
- **Ripple**
- **Bitcoin Cash**
- And other major cryptocurrencies

This gives you flexibility and diversification, which is always a smart move in crypto.

## Is RiseETH a Scam?

Let’s address the elephant in the room.

From what I’ve seen and experienced, **RiseETH is not a scam**. It works as advertised, has functioning trading tools, and doesn’t make wild promises like “Get rich overnight.”

That said, it’s **not officially regulated**, which is something to keep in mind. Always trade responsibly and don’t dump your life savings into any platform, no matter how legit it seems.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on RiseETH?

The minimum deposit to start trading on RiseETH is **$250**.

This is pretty standard for platforms like this (Bitcoin Code, Immediate Edge, etc.). The funds are used to activate your account and start trading, either manually or through automation.

If you’re new to trading, I recommend starting with the minimum and scaling up as you get more comfortable.

### RiseETH Customer Support

The customer support on RiseETH is surprisingly solid.

You can reach them via:

- **Live chat** (available 24/7)
- **Email support**

I tested both, and response times were fast—within a few minutes on chat, and under 12 hours for email.

## How do you start trading on RiseETH?

Getting started is super simple. You don’t need to be a tech wizard to set it up.

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Go to the RiseETH homepage and fill out the registration form. It only asks for basic info like your name, email, and phone number.

Make sure to use a real number—you’ll need it for verification.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

After registering, you’ll be prompted to verify your identity and **deposit at least $250** to activate your trading account.

You can fund your account using:

- Credit/Debit card
- Wire transfer
- Crypto (in some regions)

### Step 3: Start Trading

Once your account is funded, you can start trading immediately.

You can choose between:

- **Manual trading**
- **Automated trading** (recommended for beginners)

Take some time to explore the dashboard, set alerts, or use the demo account if you want to practice first.

## How to Delete a RiseETH Account?

If you ever want to delete your RiseETH account, it’s pretty straightforward.

- Contact customer support via email or chat.
- Request account deletion.
- They’ll confirm and process it within 24–48 hours.

Just make sure to **withdraw your funds** first (obviously).

Wanted to share a recipe with you today, this is a Chicken Stir Fry, loaded with vegetables and of course, chicken.

I did follow a recipe I found on TT for the sauce, but honestly you could make any type of sauce you wanted. I used a store bought ginger and garlic mix, but won't do that in the future. I find that the paste you can buy in the stores has no taste to it at all. If you want the true ginger and garlic taste in your food, buy real ginger and garlic, and make it yourself.

I had re, green and yellow peppers in here along with white onions, and asparagus. I would probably add peanuts next time as I really enjoy the crunch.

I ultimately paired this with Mi Goreng instant fried noodles as the boys like that versus rice.

The noodles that I buy are from WM and these are the ones - absolutely delicious, but if you have to watch your carbs you probably want to avoid these OR save your calories (and carbs) for this at dinner.

https://preview.redd.it/4fj6ivsishze1.png?width=612&format=png&auto=webp&s=98b12211c951233d4136e5f2d2d543af8949f3f9

For the sauce mixture and chicken marinade, this is what I used:

* 2 tbsp Light soy sauce
* 2 tbsp Dark soy sauce
* Ginger and Garlic paste (to taste - I  LOVE ginger and garlic so used like 2 tbsp of each)
   * Next time, I'll buy fresh ginger and garlic and mince it myself
* 1 tbsp Hoisin sauce (you could also use oyster sauce)
* 1 tsp Cornstarch
* 1 tbsp water

Vegetables:

* 3 cups of sliced red, green and yellow pepper
* 2 cup of sliced white onions
* 3 cups of sliced asparagus

For the actual stir fry, I first marinated the chicken (it was about 2 chicken breast - I don't like chicken thigh but it is supposed to be better for stir fry since you get the fat from the chicken thigh). This was probably about 2lbs of chicken breast thinly sliced.

After allowing the chicken to marinate for about 20-30 minutes, I stir fried this in oil until it was cooked through. Don't over cook it otherwise it will dry out. I used canola oil, maybe 4 or 5 tablespoons.

Once the chicken was done, I carefully removed the chicken leaving behind the marinade that was left and started to cook the onions, peppers and finally the asparagus. Once they were done (maybe 3 - 5 minutes) I added the chicken back in. 

There wasn't enough sauce, so I made another batch of the sauce and added it to the stir fry.

What I like is that you can eat this without rice, or noodles (if you so desire).

According to ChatGPT the nutritional breakdown is:

* 2028 Calories
   * 267g Protein
   * 100g Carbs
   * 60g Fat

I was able to get 4 servings, which made this breakdown:

* 507 Calories
   * 67g Protein (!!!)
   * 25g Carbs
   * 15g Fat

For one meal that's not too bad!

Now if you eat this with rice, or noodles you'll have to calculate those calories and macros in addition to what's in the dish itself but honestly this is a pretty ""responsible"" meal and something you won't get tired of.

What I like about stir fry is that you can add *any vegetables* to it! I usually add broccoli, but didn't have any. I also like baby bok choy.

For dessert, I made [this ](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfaccountable/comments/1jyragz/random_madness_april_14_2024_easy_dessert_recipe/)([https://www.reddit.com/r/selfaccountable/comments/1jyragz/random\_madness\_april\_14\_2024\_easy\_dessert\_recipe/)](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfaccountable/comments/1jyragz/random_madness_april_14_2024_easy_dessert_recipe/) which I had posted about 24 days ago. The one difference is that I added some instant coffee to it and like last time I did not add any sweetener to it - this time, the boys and I really enjoyed it. This desert is super easy to make and you get A LOT of protein (if you use protein powder).

But one challenge is that his lights are huge. They take up like a foot of vertical space.

1khilqf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1khilqf,Selling MRE’s for $6 each,"MRE's are pre-packaged food rations most commonly used by survivalists, campers and those in the military. I am offering these to the general public as inexpensive, filling, no-prep meals that are just as fun to make as they are tasty.

There are a total of 24 different menu items, and upon purchase you will receive one meal of your choosing (based on inventory at time of purchase). The menu list is as follows:

Chili with Beans
Shredded BBQ Beef
Beef Ravioli in Meat Sauce
Spaghetti with Beef and Sauce
Chicken Breast
Beef Taco
Brisket Entrée
Meatballs in Marinara Sauce
Beef Stew
Chili and Macaroni
Taco Pasta (Vegetarian) 
Elbow Macaroni in Tomato Sauce
Cheese Tortellini in Tomato Sauce (Vegetarian)
Creamy Spinach Fettuccine (Vegetarian)
Mexican Style Chicken Stew
Chicken Burrito Bowl
Maple Flavored Pork Sausage Patty
Chicken, Egg Noodles, and Vegetables in Sauce
Jalapeño Pepper Jack Beef Patty
Italian Sausage with Peppers and Onions in Marinara Sauce
Water Packed Light Sodium Tuna
Asian Style Beef Strips with Vegetables
Pepperoni Pizza 
Southwest Style Beef and Black Beans

Every MRE includes a full meal kit: entrée, side, dessert/snack, crackers or bread, a spread (like cheese or peanut butter), beverage powder, flameless heater (FRH), utensils, and an accessory pack (gum, coffee, condiments, matches, napkin, and more).

Preparation is simple, you just add the entrée pouch and some water to the flameless heater, and a chemical reaction with the packet inside heats the water enough to make the entrée as hot as a fresh cooked meal in as little as 10 minutes. 

As your food heats, you're encouraged to enjoy the rest of the contents of the MRE. Or enjoy an MRE on the go, and utilize the various snacks throughout the day until you're ready to heat the entrée! Everything other than the entrée itself is designed for quick, on-the-go enjoyment; some even come packaged with name-brand candy like M&M's or Reese's Pieces. 

Why MRE's?:
Though MRE's are originally meant for soldiers, they helped me fight a different kind of battle. I was depressed, unmotivated to take care of myself, barely eating, and couldn’t bring myself to cook or grocery shop. Takeout felt too expensive, and meal prep services skyrocketed in price after their intro offers expire. Then I remembered watching MRE unboxing videos online and gave them a shot. Their high calorie content helped me regain energy and maintain a healthy weight — and they actually tasted good. Ironically, these ""survival meals"" helped me survive every day life.  Now I'm inspired to help feed my community by providing the same inexpensive nourishment to those who can benefit from it as much as I have.

What Makes MRE's Great:
Ready-to-Eat, No Cooking Required
Long Shelf Life (up to 5 years)
Self-Heating with Flameless Heater
All-in-One Meal Kit
Portable and Compact Packaging
High-Calorie and Nutrient Dense
Variety of Menu Options
Water-Activated Heating System
No Refrigeration Required
Military-Grade Durability
Cost Effective Way To Stay Full

Are MRE's Right For Me?
Are you looking for a cheap yet filling meal?
Are you curious about what it's like to eat like a soldier in the field?
Does the thought of MRE's make you nostalgic of your service days?
Are you an avid camper?
Do you want hot food without needing electricity?
Do you not have enough time to cook?
Do you hate meal prepping for yourself? 
Are you sick and tired of how expensive food is nowadays?
Is being prepared for any kind of emergency or disaster important to you?

Then yes, MRE's are right for you!

How To Get An MRE?
Simply come to my place of residence and purchase as many as you like. I take cash, venmo and cashapp. Message me and ask when we can arrange to meet. Please let me know how many you're interested in so I can manage my inventory properly. I'm afraid I can't offer any kind of bundle discount for multiple purchases since $6 each is the lowest possible price I can offer, but if you want a lot of them I might be able to give you a whole case of 12 for $60.

Message me now to schedule a pickup — inventory moves quickly!

Health & Safety Disclaimer:
MRE meals may contain or be processed in facilities that handle common allergens including soy, wheat, dairy, eggs, tree nuts, and peanuts. Please read individual package labels carefully. Products are shelf-stable and safe to consume up to 5 years from the manufacture date when stored in a cool, dry place; do not use if packaging is swollen, leaking, or compromised. Use caution with flameless ration heaters (FRH): they generate heat and steam, may cause burns if handled improperly, and should never be used in enclosed or poorly ventilated areas. Pouches are not microwave safe. Keep out of reach of children and follow instructions closely. ",1,1746682519.0,kclist,0,1.0,False

Anyone else feel like every week there's a new ""revolutionary"" trading platform popping up? I swear, it's like crypto Tinder out here—swipe left on scams, swipe right on something that might just work. So when I kept seeing **[Gira Doreix](https://tinyurl.com/3dzubp8y)** mentioned in forums, emails, and even in some ads, I figured I should check it out myself.

With platforms like **Bitcoin Code** and **Immediate Edge** becoming more mainstream, Gira Doreix seems to be riding that same wave—but with its own twist. Whether you're a beginner trying not to get wrecked or a seasoned trader looking for smarter tools, this review is for you.

I’ll break down everything you need to know about Gira Doreix—from how it works to what the catch might be. I've tested it, played around with the features, and even made a few trades to see if it lives up to the hype. Let’s get into it.

## What is Gira Doreix?

Gira Doreix is a trading platform that offers both **automated and manual trading options** across multiple asset classes. Think of it like a one-stop-shop where you can trade **cryptocurrencies, stocks, forex, and even commodities**, all from a single dashboard.

What makes it stand out is its focus on **user-friendliness combined with real-time analytics**. Whether you're bullish on Bitcoin or just want to diversify your portfolio, Gira Doreix aims to simplify the process without dumbing it down.

It’s particularly appealing to newer traders who want automation to do the heavy lifting. But even if you’re a pro, the **custom alerts and multi-asset support** give it solid utility.

## Who Created Gira Doreix?

This is where things get a bit vague. Like many platforms in this category (think Immediate Edge or Bitcoin Era), Gira Doreix doesn’t make the creators super public. There’s no Elon Musk-style figurehead or flashy founder video.

That said, it appears to be developed by a group of fintech professionals and algorithmic trading experts who’ve worked behind the scenes on other similar projects. The platform itself is polished enough that it’s clearly not a fly-by-night operation.

Still, I’d love to see more transparency in terms of leadership and development team. It would definitely boost trust.

## How Does Gira Doreix Work?

Gira Doreix works by combining **advanced trading algorithms** with real-time market data to help users make better decisions. You can go full-auto and let the system trade for you, or take the wheel yourself.

Here’s what happens behind the scenes:

- The algorithm scans the market 24/7, looking for profitable opportunities.
- It evaluates historical trends, price movement, and volume in milliseconds.
- When a potential trade is identified, it either executes it automatically or alerts you, depending on your settings.

You get a **dashboard that shows your portfolio**, market trends, and settings you can tweak for risk level, asset focus, and more. The automation isn’t magic—it follows your rules, which is actually how it should be.

## Gira Doreix Pros and Cons

Let’s keep it real. No platform is perfect. Here’s what I found:

**Pros:**

- **User-friendly interface** – Even my cousin who barely uses Excel figured it out.
- **Supports multiple asset types** – Not just crypto.
- **Custom trading alerts** – You can fine-tune what you get notified about.
- **Demo mode** – Test strategies before risking real money.
- **Mobile-optimized** – Works well on your phone browser.

**Cons:**

- **No public info on creators** – A little mystery isn’t always a good thing.
- **Not regulated** – Like most similar platforms, it's not backed by a financial authority.
- **Minimum $250 deposit** – Could be a barrier for some beginners.

- **Desktops and Laptops** (Windows, macOS)
- **Smartphones** (iOS and Android browsers)
- **Tablets** (all major browsers supported)

I tested it on Chrome, Safari, and even Firefox—no issues. It adjusts to screen size well, so you can trade while waiting in line for coffee.

## Gira Doreix – Supported Countries

Gira Doreix is available in most countries, including:

- **United States**
- **Canada**
- **United Kingdom**
- **Australia**
- **Germany**

That said, certain countries with strict crypto or trading laws (like North Korea, Iran, and a few others) are geo-blocked. Always check your local regulations before signing up.

## Gira Doreix – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

Gira Doreix’s algorithm constantly digests market data to spot **real-time trading opportunities**. It’s like having a Wall Street analyst in your pocket—but one that doesn’t need sleep or caffeine.

This feature is especially useful for day traders and swing traders who rely on fast, informed decisions.

### User-Friendly Interface

This is where Gira Doreix really shines. The dashboard is **clean, intuitive, and customizable**. All the essential info—charts, balances, and trade history—is just a click away.

Even if you're not tech-savvy, you’ll feel comfortable navigating the platform within minutes.

### Mobile Accessibility

You don’t need to chain yourself to a desktop. Gira Doreix works perfectly on mobile browsers. It’s **mobile-responsive**, meaning it adjusts to your screen without losing functionality.

You can monitor trades, check alerts, and even execute transactions while on the go.

### Customizable Alerts

You can set alerts based on:

- Price levels

- Market news
- Asset performance

This gives you more control and helps avoid FOMO or panic-selling. Alerts come via email and in-platform notifications.

### Multiple Asset Trading

Gira Doreix supports:

## Is Gira Doreix a Scam?

Short answer: **No, it doesn’t appear to be a scam.**

Longer answer: While it’s not regulated and lacks public info about the creators, it functions as advertised. I deposited money, made trades, and withdrew funds without a hitch.

That said, **always trade responsibly** and don’t invest money you can’t afford to lose. Automation is helpful, but it’s not foolproof.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Gira Doreix?

The minimum deposit is **$250**, which is pretty standard for platforms like this. It’s enough to get a few trades going without being too risky.

I’d recommend starting with the minimum and only increasing it once you’re comfortable.

### Gira Doreix Customer Support

Customer support is available **24/7 via live chat and email**. I tested both; live chat responded within 5 minutes, and email took about 2 hours.

They were helpful and didn’t try to upsell me, which is rare.

## How do you start trading on Gira Doreix?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Head to the official Gira Doreix site and fill out the registration form with your name, email, and phone number.

No payment required at this stage.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

You’ll be asked to verify your ID (standard KYC stuff) and then deposit at least **$250** to begin trading.

Payment methods include:

- Credit/Debit Cards

### Step 3: Start Trading

Once your account is funded, you can choose between:

- **Manual trading** – You decide when to buy/sell.
- **Automated trading** – Let the algorithm handle trades based on your preferences.

Use the **demo mode** first to get a feel for things.

## How to Delete a Gira Doreix Account?

Make sure to withdraw any funds first.

I visited Rameshwaram Café, driven purely by the social media hype. I ordered a plain idly just to ""try it,"" and asked the server to add a bit of ghee for tasting (also saved a few bucks—lol). Unfortunately… I loved it. The chutneys were outstanding, and pairing them with the idly? Game-changer. I finished the entire plate. I loved it, man!

Pero recently (3-4 days ago) medyo dry convo namin saglit lang rin kami mag usap baka dahil busy nga rin siya since namention niya nung wekends may mga aasikasuhin siya this week and this month.

Context: 
I've been single for 2 years na may nireto saakin ka-work ko best friend niya since highschool and around mid March kami nag start mag usap, gandang ganda ako sa kanya to the point na feeling ko love at first sight (corny, i know but yeah ito nafefeel ko). Sa BPO industry ako nag wowork siya naman teacher at a university and namention rin ng friend ko sa kanya baka sa oras di kami magka tugma at baka weekends lang kami makakapag usap talaga since graveyard shift ako. Si girl(23) nbsb pero nay nakalandian dati which was 2 yrs ago pa. First meet was good naman tho di ko siya matatawag na actual date kase saglit lang kami nag sama nun and may event sila sa school sinurprise ko kase siya inentertain niya rin naman ako nung time na yun. After our first meet yung ka-work ko prehas niya kami tinanong if pasado ba. Si girl di pa niya masasabi na pasado pero may good comments naman and titignan niya pa after 3 months. Ako naman sabi ko sa ka-work ko mukhang pasado naman din siya para saakin pero titignan ko pa kako once nag date na talaga kami. So eto na nga first date namin inaya ko siya mag coffee shop then mag dinner sa labas. The date went well nag vibe kami we have a lot in common also namention ko rin sa kanya in the case na liligawan ko na siya ipapaalam ko muna sa parents niya as a sign if respect at to give assurance na seryoso ako sa anak nila.

Everything was doing good nakakapunta rin ako sa bahay nila ayun tatambay sa kanila nakilala ako officially ng parents and family niya also sobrang natutuwa ako sa family niya. Meron rin times na nakikita ko sa notes niya sa messenger na nay cravings binibilhan ko siya at ibiyabiyahe ko sa kanila (around 45mins-1hr drive) and binilhan ko rin ng mga souvenirs nung nag travel ako. Minsan pag may time ako hatid sundo rin ginagawa ko. Lagi niya iniistory ano man binibigay ko which I appreciate it a lot. Bet rin ako ng friends and girl bff niya na parang comfortable sila saakin. Binigyan rin ako heads up na si girl di nag eentertain basta basta and di niya ako pinapayagan puntahan siya for nothing. 

But like what I've said earlier recently ang dry ng convo all of a sudden and sobrang bihira kami mag chat. Baka nga busy talaga siya. Ang hirap maging overthinker naiisip ko ""bakit di na siya nag rereply agad agad"" ""may nagawa or nasabi ba ako?"" ""Tinetest niya lang ba patience ko?"" Etc a lot is going through my head. Its stressful. Ngayon di ko sure paano ko ihahandle yung ganito ayaw ko lang rin kase masayang lahat ng effort ko.

If you’ve ever used platforms like **Bitcoin Code**, **Immediate Edge**, or **Bitcoin Era**, this might feel familiar…but with some twists.

In this review, I’ll break down exactly what Celturex is, who’s behind it, how it works, and whether it’s worth your time. I’ll be fair and honest—pointing out the good, the great, and the “eh, could be better.” Let’s get into it.

## What is Celturex?

Celturex is an **automated trading platform** designed to help users trade cryptocurrencies and other financial assets with minimal hassle.

Think of it like a smarter, faster assistant that scans markets, spots opportunities, and executes trades for you. While it sounds a lot like other bots out there, what makes Celturex stand out is its **focus on simplicity**. Seriously, the whole thing feels like it was made for people who are new to trading or don’t want to spend hours glued to charts.

It supports a range of assets beyond just crypto—including **Forex, indices, and commodities**—so you're not stuck in one market. Whether you’re looking to dip your toes in or automate your current trading strategies, Celturex feels like a decent entry point.

## Who Created Celturex?

This is where things get a little murky—and pretty typical for platforms like this.

The creators of Celturex haven’t made themselves super public (which always raises my eyebrow a bit). But from what I could gather, it’s developed by a group of fintech pros with backgrounds in **algorithmic trading and blockchain tech**, similar to the teams behind Bitcoin Code and Immediate Edge.

While that lack of transparency might be a red flag for some, it’s not uncommon in automated trading. The key thing is that the **brokers they partner with seem legit and regulated**, which is more important than knowing the devs' LinkedIn pages.

## How Does Celturex Work?

Celturex uses **algorithms and AI-powered trading signals** to analyze market trends and execute trades automatically. You set your preferences—like how much you want to invest, how aggressive or conservative you want to be—and the platform does the rest.

Here’s the basic flow:

- You create an account and deposit funds.
- The system scans real-time market data using historical patterns and indicators.
- Once an opportunity is identified, trades are executed on your behalf.
- You can monitor, pause, or adjust your strategy at any time.

It’s kind of like having a robo-trader that doesn’t sleep. This is especially helpful for those of us who don’t have the time (or patience) to manually track the market 24/7.

## Celturex Pros and Cons

To keep it real, here’s what I liked and didn’t like:

**Pros:**

- **Super beginner-friendly** interface
- Supports **multiple asset types**, not just crypto
- Offers a **demo account** to test before using real money
- **Fast withdrawals** (generally within 24-48 hours)
- **Mobile-friendly design** for trading on the go
- Decent **customer support** via chat & email

**Cons:**

- No info about the **founding team**
- **Not available in all countries**
- Automated systems can still make **bad trades** (no such thing as a guarantee)
- Requires a **minimum deposit** of $250, which may be steep for some

There isn’t a standalone app in the App Store or Google Play (as of now), but the mobile site is responsive and works well. I tested it on both iPhone and Android, and it was smooth. No weird lag or layout issues.

## Celturex – Supported Countries

Celturex is available in most countries, especially across **Europe, Asia, Australia, and South America**. However, it’s **not currently supported in the U.S. or Canada**, likely due to stricter trading regulations.

Here’s a quick breakdown:

- ✅ Supported: UK, Germany, Spain, Australia, South Africa, India, Brazil
- ❌ Not Supported: USA, Canada, North Korea (obviously), and a few Middle Eastern countries

Always double-check this during sign-up. If you’re geo-blocked, the site usually won’t let you proceed to the dashboard.

## Celturex – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

The platform’s AI engine continuously monitors global markets and reacts to shifts in milliseconds. It’s not just about speed—it’s about **accuracy**, and Celturex seems to do a decent job with both.

### User-Friendly Interface

If you’ve ever used clunky trading tools with a million tabs and graphs, you’ll appreciate Celturex’s layout. It’s clean, easy to navigate, and doesn’t overwhelm you with jargon.

### Mobile Accessibility

Even without a dedicated app, Celturex runs great on mobile. You can check trades, adjust settings, and withdraw funds—all from your phone while waiting for your coffee.

### Customizable Alerts

You can set **price alerts, trade limits, and risk preferences**. This gives you more control than some other auto-trading platforms, which just do everything without asking.

### Multiple Asset Trading

Celturex isn’t just for crypto. You can also trade:

- **Forex**
- **Commodities**
- **Indices**

This is a huge plus if you want to diversify your strategy or aren’t totally sold on crypto alone.

## Is Celturex a Scam?

Based on my tests and user feedback, **Celturex is not a scam**. It has functioning features, real broker integrations, and users (myself included) have successfully funded and withdrawn money.

But let’s be honest—**automated trading always carries risk**. No platform, no matter how good the algorithm, can guarantee profits 100% of the time. You can lose money, especially in volatile markets. So don’t treat it like a magic money machine.

That said, Celturex checks enough boxes to be considered **legit** and **safe for cautious users**.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Celturex?

The minimum deposit to start trading with Celturex is **$250**.

This is pretty standard for platforms in this space (Bitcoin Code and others have the same requirement). It’s enough to give the platform room to trade, but not so high that it feels unreachable for regular folks.

### Celturex Customer Support

Customer support is available **24/7 via live chat and email**. I tested both and got a response in under 10 minutes via chat, which is solid.

They also have a basic help center with FAQs and setup guides—nothing groundbreaking, but it covers the essentials.

## How do you start trading on Celturex?

Getting started is super simple and takes less than 10 minutes.

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Go to the Celturex homepage and enter your name, email, and phone number. You’ll get a confirmation email with a verification link.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

After verifying, you’ll be connected to a **partner broker**. Deposit at least $250 using credit card, debit card, or crypto.

### Step 3: Start Trading

Once funded, you can use the **demo mode** to practice or jump straight into live trading. Adjust your settings, and let the platform do its thing.

## How to Delete a Celturex Account?

If you want to delete your Celturex account, here’s how:

1. **Log in** to your account.
2. Go to **Settings > Account Management**.
3. Click **“Delete Account”** and confirm.

Alternatively, you can email customer support with a request. They’ll usually process it within 24 hours.

## The Verdict

If you’re new to trading or just want to automate part of your strategy, **Celturex is a solid choice**. It’s easy to use, supports multiple assets, and has enough safety nets to make it feel less risky than some of its competitors.

Sure, it’s not perfect—lack of transparency about the team and no U.S. support are downsides—but overall, it’s **worth trying out**, especially with the demo mode and relatively low barrier to entry.

Just remember: use money you can afford to lose, experiment in demo mode first, and don’t expect overnight riches.

**A Bright Smile Can Transform Your Look and Confidence**

Thanks to the evolution of cosmetic dentistry, a flawless smile is more accessible than ever. Hollywood Smile transformations are rapidly replacing traditional individual veneer procedures across Dubai. In this guide, we’ll explore everything you need to know about Hollywood Smile—from types and benefits to how to find the best clinic and ensure a confident, radiant smile.

# 💫 What Is a Hollywood Smile?

The Hollywood Smile is a comprehensive cosmetic dental makeover that enhances the overall appearance of your teeth and facial harmony. It often involves multiple procedures customized to your needs, such as veneers, whitening, gum contouring, and aligners—aimed at delivering the symmetrical, dazzling smile associated with Hollywood celebrities.

# 🌟 Types of Hollywood Smile

**1. Classic Hollywood Smile**  
Bright white, naturally aligned teeth in perfect lip relation.

**2. Celebrity Hollywood Smile**  
High-glamour results through veneers, whitening, and sometimes orthodontics.

**3. Veneer Hollywood Smile**  
Uses porcelain veneers or Lumineers to correct flaws like chips, discoloration, or alignment issues.

**4. Whitening Hollywood Smile**  
Focuses on professional teeth whitening techniques for enhanced brightness.

**5. Alignment Hollywood Smile**  
Utilizes braces or clear aligners for perfectly straight teeth.

**6. Gummy Hollywood Smile**  
Achieved through gum contouring to create a balanced tooth-to-gum ratio.

**7. Contoured Hollywood Smile**  
Teeth are reshaped and contoured for a more refined and symmetrical appearance.

# 🔍 Key Components of Hollywood Smile

* **Veneers**: Custom-made shells placed on teeth to improve aesthetics.

# 👩‍⚕️ Who’s an Ideal Candidate?

**Cons:**

# 🦷 Understanding Veneers

Dental veneers are thin, custom-made shells used to cover the front surface of teeth, improving their color, shape, and alignment.

**Types of Veneers:**

* **Porcelain Veneers**: Durable and stain-resistant.
* **Composite Veneers**: Affordable, done in a single visit.
* **Ceramic Veneers**: Natural-looking and long-lasting.
* **E-Max Veneers**: Highly translucent and strong.
* **Zirconia Veneers**: Ideal for heavy chewing and maximum strength.

**Good Candidates for Veneers:**

* Have healthy teeth/gums.
* Minor cosmetic flaws like discoloration or gaps.
* Enough enamel to support the veneer.

1khih9z,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1khih9z/lost/,Lost,"TLDR: Feeling suicidal lately. Don't know if I need therapy, medication, a divorce, or a combination thereof. I love my wife and kids but feel my life is spiraling downward. I wonder AITA b/c I pushed my wife, something I've never done. 

Looking for some advice or someone to tell me I'm just crazy.

I '49M' and my wife '46F' have been married for what will be 27 yrs in a couple weeks. We have four kids, all of whom are grown, with the youngest in the latter years of high school. On paper, our family is pretty damn good. Beneath the surface, it is anything but.

My wife is highly extroverted and needs to be out several nights a week to recharge. I'm the complete opposite. As a highly introverted person, I get exhausted from being around too many people. I don't despise people. It's just that I get drained after a few hours of public activity. I gotta go home and recharge.

This past weekend we got into a fight over my wife's need to go out and my disdain for it. It's less a trust issue and more an issue of I just can't fathom how someone needs to go to wineries and restaurants 3-5 days and/or nights a week. If I were to go to a bar that frequently, I wonder if people would question whether I was an alcoholic. 

She doesn't get trashed, but she gets enough in her to take the edge off and borders on the level of I shouldn't drive. She has an autoimmune disease and claims that it helps. I've told her that alcohol isn't a solid coping mechanism. 

As our argument got more intense, I told her she needed to leave me alone and that the discussion was over. I no longer wanted to talk about it. She kept egging on. I repeatedly said to drop it. In a fit of rage, I lept from the bed and pushed her through the doorway from our bedroom into the dining room. 

She has balance issues b/c of the autoimmune disease. She falls over sometimes from putting her pants on. When I pushed her, she went down to the floor hard, screamed, and burst into tears. Mind you i was angry, but I pushed her with the force one would use on a child to move them out of the way of something or to redirect them.

I immediately felt like a horrible person. She went into ""her room"". We sleep in separate rooms, cuz I'm a super light sleeper, and she stays up/out far later than me. I followed her in and sat at the opposite end of the bed while she collected herself. She worked through the tears, told me she was ok, and it was ok.

I held my head in my hands with tears coming down, telling her that it's not ok. She went in and talked to our son, the high schooler, who didn't directly witness the exchange but walked into the dining room to see his mother laid out on the floor.

I went back to my room and got in bed. She came in, kissed me on the cheek, and wished me goodnight. 

The next day, I felt like crap all day. I was a wreck at work. All I could think about was what had transpired. I've never put my hands on a woman in any fashion. 

That night spiraled even further. I got off work and headed to get a haircut. Finished that and went home to cut the grass. Came in, started doing laundry, folding clothes, and putting them away. Then, I had to start packing. 

Today, I graduated with my master's. I carried a 4.0 GPA while working a full-time and two part-time jobs. I was excited that I was going to walk across the stage with my family there to witness my achievement. 

Instead, while packing for the trip, my wife called to say she and the family would not be accompanying me to my graduation. The university is a few states and about nine hours away. It's a distance learning program. 

When she told me they weren't going, I was emotionless. She asked if I had anything I'd like to say, and I said no. I felt empty.

I spent much of yesterday driving with still no emotion. I stared blankly at the interstate in front of me. For several hours, I was having an out of body experience. My body was present in the rental car, but my mind was elsewhere. Who knows where it was, too?!

I crossed into the state in which the university is. I suddenly burst into tears. The feeling of being a real shitbag had finally come over me. I cried for a few miles and contemplated pulling over on the highway. It was that ugly kind of crying.

I made it to my hotel. Checked in and then went for a walk around the downtown area to try to clear my head. It didn't really help, but it was good exercise from sitting in the rental car all day. Went to bed in hope of getting some restful sleep. Slept like shit and woke up around 4 am. 

I laid around the hotel room for a few hours. Eventually, I got ready and headed to Burger King for some coffee and breakfast. From there, I headed for the university. 

I was early, but eventually, I walked across that stage. Amidst cheers from the crowd, I knew my family wasn't there. I felt like an ass throughout the ceremony. As soon as it ended, I walked out to the car, disrobed from the regalia, and headed back to the hotel. 

Back in the room, I gazed out across the downtown with empty feelings and thoughts of suicide. I went down to the hotel bar, ate a late lunch, and had a few Captain and Cokes. Came back upstairs to my empty room, still thinking about suicide, and turned on the TV. I laid on the bed to be at peace for a few minutes before I did the deed. I fell asleep. 

I leave tomorrow to go visit our daughter who lives a few states away from this one. I'm still struggling, but I'm gonna try to hold on at least until I get home next week.

I love my wife and kids, but I've been a shitty husband and father. I lost a high school friend to suicide a couple of months ago. His death really hit me. With the way the last couple of days have gone. I wonder if I should tell my wife we need to get a divorce. I was raised marriage is till death does you part. But I am beginning to wonder if I am incapable of love. I find little joy in life lately.

My wife told me during a fight last month that I needed to see a therapist. I wonder if I need to be medicated. What kinds of medications would help me? Is divorce  the right route? I cried to God, but my head isn't in the right space. I don't know which path to take.

My wife is far from perfect, but I wonder if she deserves better. AITA?",4,1746682035.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

How long before I follow up and how?","My dream job came open about two months ago. I applied and got an interview. The interview went extremely well. The hiring manager ended the interview by telling me that she wanted to advance me to the next round (of 3) and that someone from talent acquisition would be in contact in the next week. A week went by, and I heard nothing. I reached out to the hiring manager. She responded very quickly and said ""After careful consideration, we've made the difficult decision to put this role on hold for the time being.""

Crushing, but she did follow it up with ""However, I truly enjoyed our conversation and consider you a top candidate to take through the interview process. If you’d like, once we receive approval to continue with the hiring process, I can follow up with you then to see if you’re still interested?"" I put her email into an AI detector. The first part was flagged as an AI response. But the second hopeful bit was not. Maybe I'm reading too much into that, but it made me feel like it was genuine.

I thanked her and said I hoped to hear from her. It's been about a month since that exchange and I haven't heard anything. I've been watching their website and the job has been taken down and hasn't been reposted.

My questions are: How long should I wait before following up? Should I stick to an email? Would it be appropriate to ask if we could meet up for coffee?

Hey all,
So I've got this job offer that's making me feel kinda conflicted, and I could really use some outside perspective.

What I'm really after is deepening my iOS skills - not just frantically adapting to new frameworks every other week, you know?

The pay structure is interesting too - base salary is... ok... but they've got this whole thing with project performance bonuses and quarterly incentives tied to GP%. Feels like they're dangling carrots to make up for what might be a pretty unstable environment.

Part of me is like ""hey, challenge accepted!"" but my gut is screaming ""burnout factory."" Also, if I burn out within the 6 month probation and my performance drops then I’m fired and wasted 6 months I could have been honing my iOS skills.

everything started out ""fine."" it was incrediblu busy and hectic because there's supposed to be 3 people working closing but only 2 were scheduled. whatever, we got through it. well, then my coworker had an emergency and had to leave 3 hours before closing. most of the work gets done in the last hour, so a lot wasn't done.

someone from a different Dunkin came in to help, but he had to leave AT 10. couldn't be later, which you have to stay until at least 10:30 to activate finish everything. the last 2 shifts, we were out between 10:20-10:45. still only 2 people but with people who know what they were doing.

so, after the guy left, I did whatever else I could remember. I ended up leaving at 11:45 and I know I didn't get it all done, I just don't know what the things I didn't do are.

so, I just want to know if this sounds unreasonable. I've been employed here for 3 weeks but this week has been my first time closing. should I already understand all of this? am I learning to slowly? I'm really worried about this. I need this job and I love to excell at my job. I love going above and beyond. I love taking pride in my work. whether it's curing cancer or serving coffee, I want to do my best, and I'm worried I'm not doing that.

should I already know all of this? am I learning at an unreasonably slow pace?",2,1746681310.0,DunkinDonuts,2,1.0,False

Ah, man, this is so boring!”  
  
Raena dropped back in the enormous bed, staring at the baldachin that hung over her head. Thin layers of semi-transparent white fabric hung the four-poster bed from all sides, supposedly to give the loving couple some privacy. Or maybe it was just to create an atmosphere for their first night together since it really didn’t do much in terms of concealing anything.  
  
It had been four hours since they had escorted her to the bridal chamber. She was instructed to wait for her husband in her ceremonial gown since, according to their traditions, he was supposed to be the first person to take her wedding veil off and gaze upon her face. He hadn’t shown up, of course, not that she expected him to.  
  
A knock echoed through the room, and Raena sat up with a sigh. Grabbing the veil lying next to her on the bed, she threw it over her head, no longer caring that it tilted to the side. Every half an hour, they would check on her to make certain she wasn’t asleep, then they would leave her alone again. And every time, they said the same thing:  
  
“Your Highness, please be patient. His Highness will come soon.”   
  
“Yes,” she replied as the palace maid turned to leave. “Wait! Send my maid in.”  
  
The young girl froze for a moment, glancing up and then bowing down immediately as if afraid she’d be punished for doing so.  
  
“Yes, Your Highness,” she murmured before disappearing through the door.  
  
Raena took the veil off again, tossing it on the bed as she slid to the floor. The ceremonial attire included a thin, long underdress of shimmering cream color, covered by a richly embroidered, gem-encrusted gown that seemed to weigh a ton. Being the Prime Minister’s only daughter and all, her family had gone overboard in showing their wealth and status.   
  
Raena started pulling the hairpins out of her long, blonde hair and throwing them on the vanity table in front of her. Staring at the still unfamiliar reflection in the mirror, she had to remind herself that she was no longer Lydia Myles, a university dropout and an overworked waitress at her mother’s restaurant. She was Lady Raena Magrath now, a noblewoman by birth and a princess by marriage, but most important of all — she was currently living in the body of a fictional character in the worst romance book ever.  
  
It was still difficult to believe that this was really happening, so every morning when she woke up, she would rush to the nearest mirror to look at herself, at this new reality that insisted she was there, inside that damn book. And every morning, a pair of baby blue eyes would stare back at her with utter disbelief until acceptance flooded her frail, new body, calming down her racing heart.  
  
A month had passed since she woke up in this world. The last thing she remembered before that was finishing a long shift at her mother’s restaurant and heading home in the early hours of the morning. Drowsy and distracted, she hadn’t seen the blade before it was too late. Then the pain came, the darkness and the voice. She still couldn’t remember what the voice had said.  
  
Waking up here, alive and without so much as a scratch on her stomach, she thought she was dreaming. Perhaps she was in a coma back home and her brain was keeping her occupied while her body fought to repair the damage. It had to be that. What else could it be?  
  
Days passed, then weeks, but she still didn’t wake up back in the real world. So she accepted that she was stuck in this place — maybe forever — and wasting her days in idle chatter and boring walks wasn’t how she wanted to spend this lucid dream or whatever was happening to her.  
  
More shocking than realizing she was no longer in her own body was the fact that this new world was actually familiar. At first, the names sounded strange, and the places she had never been to before looked vaguely familiar, but she couldn’t quite put her finger on it. It was like a word on the tip of her tongue, but she couldn’t remember what it was.   
  
All of that had changed when she learned her own name and her own fate — to become the second wife of the third prince of the Empire, Kassian Etrobia. Then it clicked.  
  
The book. The stupid book that lay abandoned on her nightstand with coffee stains on the cover. The places, the names, the people — everything was like in that book!  
  
The door opened with a quiet creak, and someone strode in, barely making any noise.  
  
“You called?”  
  
Raena turned to look at her personal maid, only to find her standing right behind her. Kara’s dark hair was gathered in a thick braid that brushed past her shoulder and barely reached her collarbone, her bright eyes staring at Raena with what she could only describe as a calculating expression.  
  
“Don’t you have to bow or something?” Raena scoffed.  
  
“Why? There is no one else here,” Kara replied flatly, glancing toward the door. “Don’t worry, I will be perfectly respectful and obedient in front of other people. I won’t taint my mistress’s reputation. After all, you’re officially a princess now. If I were to show any disrespect, I might be beaten to death.”  
  
Raena smiled. Telling Kara her secret — or at least part of it — had been a huge gamble, but it had paid off. No matter how much she knew about this world from that book, she needed someone to help her if she were to succeed in her plan — a plan that was going to allow her to exit the main storyline and live a happy, pleasant life as a rich, single lady. Away from the drama, the fighting, and the death which would soon befall this place.  
  
“I won’t let that happen,” Raena assured her, stretching her arms. Without so much as a word, Kara began loosening up the ties on the back of the gown. The pressure around Raena’s chest decreased as the dress slipped down to her ankles, leaving her in just her thin undergarments. She stepped outside of the circle of cloth and Kara quickly gathered it, setting it carefully on the bed.  
  
“Your position may give you power outside, but within this household, you hold very little of it,” Kara muttered, returning to her side and fumbling with her hair. A few more pins disappeared inside the maid’s pockets and Raena ran her fingers through the thick locks, wondering if she ever had such nice hair in the real world. “So let’s make sure we both survive.”  
  
“Don’t worry, my plan will work.” Raena smiled confidently. It had to work, it must. After all, she had an unfair advantage over everyone here. She just had to be smart about it. “Why is there no food here?”  
  
“The bride should not eat or drink anything throughout the wedding day and night, so she is clean and ready to receive the seed of her husband. It is believed the chances of conception are much higher that way,” Kara explained as she fussed over the ceremonial dress, making sure there was no damage or wrinkles on it.  
  
“What a bunch of nonsense!” Raena murmured, pressing on her rumbling stomach.   
  
“People like traditions. It gives them a sense of stability and assurance. Not everybody likes change.”  
  
“But how does that even make sense? Do people realize how hard it is to sit still for hours at a time? Not to mention that getting dehydrated is a real thing! And to top it all off, if we are to have s\*x, we’d need energy. If I don’t eat or drink all day, how am I supposed to have any strength to do it? Or am I supposed to just lie on my back like a dead fish, spread my legs open, and wait to ‘receive the seed of my husband’?”  
  
Kara closed her eyes, her lips turning into a thin line.  
  
“Really, I never know what will come out of your mouth!” she sighed at the end. “Please be mindful of what you say.”  
  
“Yes, yes. I’m shutting up,” Raena sighed with exasperation. Kara touched her arms, and Raena lifted them, patiently waiting as the maid helped her put on a simpler dress that slid around her legs in several layers of satin and gossamer. The pale blue gown brushed lightly against her skin as the maid adjusted the open sleeves before taking care of the buttons on her back. “Where are we supposed to stay after tonight?”  
  
“The third prince has given you the North Palace. The other servants should be arriving there tomorrow,” Kara replied as she finished with the buttons.  
  
“Tomorrow? That won’t work. We are going there now.”  
  
“What?” Kara exclaimed, stepping in front of her so she could look her in the eyes. “You’re supposed to stay here until morning, even if your husband doesn’t come! What if he comes and finds you gone? We’ll both get in trouble!”  
  
“He won’t come, so I have no intention of waiting any longer,” Raena said confidently.  
  
“How can you be so sure?”  
  
“The stars told me!” Raena grinned.  
  
She had decided not to tell Kara the part where their world was an exact replica of a book she had picked up in a second-hand bookshop a few months ago. Moreover, that same stupid book turned out to be an epic bore where the main characters were one-dimensional while the plot ran away from the author halfway through the story. The writer seemed more interested in describing every single detail of the world, including its history, political struggles and parties, and even social customs and events, instead of focusing on the love story or even the inevitable war she was hinting at from page one. But now all those little details, like the fact that the third prince didn’t visit his second wife’s chambers even once during their marriage, were finally worth something. Raena just wished she had forced herself to read until the end of the book instead of abandoning it halfway.  
  
“The stars, hm?” Kara echoed, pulling Raena back from her reverie.  
  
“You’ll soon find out the stars have a lot to say. Let’s go.”  
  
“I still think we should stay here. If you leave now, all kinds of rumors might start…”  
  
“Well, then,” Raena said as they reached the door. “It’s a good thing everybody already thinks that the Prime Minister’s daughter is just a beautiful girl with the brain capacity of a pumpkin. I can totally play this role! Prepare yourself to be amazed!”  
  
“With everything I’ve seen so far, I am sure you’ll exceed my expectations,” Kara deadpanned, turning the handle. “After you, Mistress.”  
  
She opened the door, bowing down as Raena moved past her. The four guards outside froze, staring at her with surprise, but it was the three maids next to the opposite wall who shook their stupor first. The oldest of them moved to block Raena’s path, bowing down and keeping her eyes on the floor as she spoke.   
  
“Your Highness, please return to the bridal chamber. You must wait for His Highness.” When Raena didn’t reply, she allowed herself a look up, only to catch Raena’s gaze. The maid bowed her head immediately, her back stiffening, and Raena smiled. She might have been a second wife in a place full of much more powerful women, but she was still a princess and these people had to listen to her. They all knew that.  
  
“But it’s so boring!” Raena pouted. “And I want food! I’m so hungry! And cookies!”  
  
“Her Highness mustn’t eat food on her wedding day,” the maid continued, her voice less confident now. She held her hands in front of her and Raena could see her squeezing them together in a mix of helplessness and frustration. “Why don’t you…”  
  
“But I want to eat now!” Raena shouted, stomping her foot. “And I’m not staying in that room, I don’t like it! It’s dark, and it’s boring!” The maid lifted her head, but this time, she held her eyes no higher than Raena’s chin. “Do you know who I am? I’m the daughter of the Prime Minister and the wife of the third prince! If you keep pestering me, I will tell my father and my husband! And then they will scold you and spank you!”  
  
The maid’s eyes widened in confusion until the realization slowly took over. Seeing the opportunity, Kara stepped forward.  
  
“Please excuse my Mistress, Head Maid,” she said in a timid, apologetic voice. “It’s past her bedtime, and she is tired. His Highness seems to be busy with important matters, so please allow us to retire to the North Palace.”  
  
“I want warm milk!” Raena interrupted, turning toward Kara, who just stared at her with an expression that almost made Raena break character and laugh. Kara composed herself, giving her a very believable smile.  
  
“Yes, Mistress,” she replied before turning back to the Head Maid. “Please, excuse us. This way, Mistress.”  
  
Kara led them past the older woman and Raena looked over her shoulder, half-expecting the Head Maid to try to stop her again. Luckily, she didn’t.  
  
They didn’t talk until they cleared the long, heavily decorated corridors of the Main Palace and stepped into the garden that Raena had spotted from the  window. The full moon rose high in the sky, generously showering them with light so they could walk without worrying about their surroundings.   
  
The garden was much grander than the Prime Minister’s, overflowing with ponds, trees, and all kinds of flowers whose fragrance filled the air like a perfume made by the most skilled artisan. It was a bit chaotic, though, as if more than one person was tending to the place and they clearly disagreed on the arrangements of the flowers, the paths, even the decorations.  
  
“My, my, I married well!” Raena chuckled as they passed another fountain that was as big as her apartment back in the real world. The waters reflected the moonlight, disturbed only by the light breeze that rippled through the air.  
  
“Yes, His Highness has been very well off ever since the end of the war. The Emperor bestowed on him many gifts and lands for the role he played in the Empire’s victory,” Kara explained, looking around. Raena knew that already, she knew more than Kara could ever imagine, but she just nodded. She had already used her luck when her new friend agreed to work with her. She didn’t want to push it. “But since you’re only the second wife, you’ll get a fixed monthly allowance. The first wife takes care of the harem and the household expenses.”  
  
“Meaning she controls the money,” Raena said, and Kara nodded. “Doesn’t matter! We’ll manage until our business takes up. I’ll figure out a way to get more money from my sister-wife too.”  
  
“You’re quite optimistic for someone in your position. Didn’t you say the world you came from favors monogamy?” she asked.   
  
“Well, yeah.” Raena shrugged. “But this is fun, and it’s not like I plan to stay married for long. Once the prince divorces me, we’ll focus on the business. Who knows, I may even get married again if I find some guy with a nice face and a fun personality!”  
  
“Fun personality?” Kara grimaced. “Is this what you look for in a husband? How is that going to help you in life?”  
  
“If I’m going to get married, why choose someone with an ugly mug that will bore me to death?” Raena grimaced. “Besides, once our business is up and running, we’ll have enough money to sustain ourselves, so we won’t be getting married to be taken care of. So a fun personality is a must!”  
  
“I don’t know where this confidence is coming from.” Kara shook her head. “You can’t predict the future, can you?”  
  
“Ha, that would have been sweet!” Raena laughed, raising her hand as they moved past a tall bush with big yellow flowers, and she ran her fingers over the smooth petals. The weather was perfect for an evening stroll and the quietness of the place relaxed her. If only she wasn’t so dead tired from the whole wedding ordeal, she would have really enjoyed it. “I just know a thing or two about running a business, so we’ll be fine. And I can read the stars!”   
  
Kara snorted, which made Raena smile.   
  
Finally, the years she spent working in her mother’s restaurant would be of some use. Considering the food she had tasted in this world so far, there was no way her venture was going to fail. It was just a matter of making the right first impression and getting people through the door. And she already had a plan for that.  
  
“Oh, my!” a male voice spoke, and both of them halted. “What do we have here?”  
  


# Chapter 2 - The Crown Prince

Raena’s eyes darted left and right, but apart from the figure half-hidden in the nearby bushes, there was no one else around. She knew that in the book, the third prince never visited his second wife’s chambers during their wedding night, but there was nothing said about meeting her outside of them.  
  
The man stepped forward, tripping and swaying to his left. He steadied himself, barely, and took another two steps in their direction. He was taller than both of them, slim but relatively fit. His hair was dark and straight, falling past his shoulders like a river of black silk. He looked devastatingly handsome, even with a drunken expression and a goofy grin on his lips. His eyes were bleary and unfocused, and even though he was staring at her, she wasn’t sure he was seeing her properly.  
  
“Tell me this is not the third prince,” Raena whispered to Kara, who was watching the man with a mix of hesitation and shock.  
  
“No, that’s…”  
  
“Hey, what a pretty lady!” The man reached the carefully arranged garden path, tripping on his own feet and flying forward. Raena instinctively raised her hands as he ran into her, his weight making her bend backward. Kara helped her steady him, and he staggered to his feet until he found his balance again. “You smell really nice!” He smiled. “Come here, I’ll give you a kiss!”  
  
“No, thank you,” Raena grimaced. “You should go get sober somewhere.”  
  
“My, aren’t you bold talking to me like that?” He leaned his hand on one of the unlit oil lamp posts that were lining the path, striking a pose that he probably thought was seductive, but in his state looked like he was trying to pee only in one of his pants legs. “What’s your name, pretty lady?”  
  
“My name is none of your business,” Raena replied with an annoyed smile.  
  
“What a strange name!”  
  
“Kara, let’s go!”  
  
Raena turned to leave, but before she could take a step, he grabbed her wrist and pulled her toward him. Raena crashed into his chest, wondering if he was wearing armor underneath. His hand wrapped around her waist, stopping her from pulling away.  
  
“I haven’t seen you before,” he murmured, staring down at her with a playful grin. “So pretty!” Picking up a lock of her hair, he brought it to his nose and sniffed it. “Ah, even your hair smells nice! Which house do you belong to? Kiss me and I’ll make you my concubine!”  
  
Without waiting for her response, he leaned down to kiss her. Raena tried to push him back, but it was like trying to move a stone wall with her bare hands. Just before his lips locked with hers, she turned her head so his mouth landed on her cheek. He slid his tongue over her skin and moaned.  
  
“Hey, haven’t you heard of consent? Let go!” she snarled, hitting his chest with her fist, but he barely seem to notice.  
  
“I don’t want to,” he murmured, his mouth continuing its exploration of her neck and shoulders. “You taste nice, too. I like it.”  
  
“Last chance, asshole! Let go!” Raena snarled.  
  
“So feisty!” he chuckled, biting her neck teasingly. “I’m going to make you…”  
  
Raena bent her knee, hitting him in the crotch with all her might. Her new body might not have been used to it and pain might have spread through her knee the moment it connected, but her father’s self-defense lessons still lived rent-free in her mind.  
  
The drunkard grunted, falling sideways on the ground. Panting from the struggle, Raena stared at him with growing frustration while he held his groin with both hands, whimpering quietly.  
  
“God, I hate those kinds of drunks!” Raena murmured, picking up her skirts and stepping away from him as he reached for her with a trembling hand. His face had turned even paler, agony and anger dancing in his eyes, but he didn’t even try to get up. “Next time, ask for permission first! Asshole!”  
  
“Mistress!” Kara hissed, pulling her hand. “Let’s go! Quickly!”   
  
“Such a waste of a handsome face,” Raena sighed, throwing one last glance at the pitiful figure on the ground before allowing Kara to pull her along the path. They half-walked, half-ran for the next ten minutes, and Kara didn’t slow down until they finally left the garden behind. By then, Raena was panting so hard, she couldn’t even ask her to stop.   
  
Raena leaned on the stone wall that ran on one side of the path, resting her hands on her burning thighs. Every breath felt like a knife twisting in her chest and her feet were shaking so hard, she was actually surprised she was still able to stand.  
  
“Why did you… make me… run?” she panted, glaring at Kara. “He won’t be… getting up… anytime… soon!”  
  
“Are you crazy?” the maid snapped, quickly lowering her voice. “Didn’t you recognize him? I even showed you his portrait!”  
  
“It was dark!” Raena winced, trying to recall if she had ever seen his face. Kara had taken the time to describe and even procured portraits of the most important people in Raena’s life — and social circles — but there had been so many that their faces were mostly a blur. “Who was it?”  
  
“That was the crown prince!” Kara said through gritted teeth. A cold chill ran down Raena’s spine that had nothing to do with the evening wind. “Do you know that attacking a member of the Imperial family is punishable by death?” She grabbed Raena’s shoulders, her fingers digging into her skin. “You kicked him in the… What if something happens? What if he can’t have children anymore? We’re dead! We’re so dead!”  
  
“Calm down!” Raena sighed, trying to sound nonchalant. She should have realized it sooner — with such looks and arrogance, of course, he’d be one of the male leads. She ought to pay more attention to their faces. “He was drunk and out of his mind! He won’t remember us or our faces!” Kara didn’t seem comforted by that, her panicked gaze searching the shadows. “Why was he alone? Aren’t royals supposed to have guards with them all the time?”  
  
“How should I know?” the maid snapped. “Maybe there were guards. Maybe they saw us and they are on their way to arrest us! By the gods, I never should have trusted you! How can you be so impulsive and… violent!”  
  
Raena frowned.  
  
“So does that mean that if he’s royalty, he can pick a girl at random, screw her in the bushes, and just go about his day?” she asked coldly.  
  
“He is the crown prince!” Kara said, as if that answered the question, then took a long breath to calm herself.   
  
“What a stupid book,” Raena murmured.  
  
“What?” Kara frowned.  
  
“Nothing. Let’s get to the North Palace. We can’t stay here all night. My legs are going to give out soon.”  
  
Kara hesitated for a moment, then took the lead again, striding alongside the crumbling wall. The path wasn’t nearly as well kept as the ones around the Main Palace, and it had holes that made them trip no matter how careful they were. There were no oil lamps either, not even unlit ones, so they walked in the dark, relying on the moon and the stars to find their way.  
  
“We’re here,” Kara announced a few minutes later and Raena stopped, looking up at the old double-winged gate that seemed a whiff away from falling down. The steps to the door had turned into a single plate of smooth stone that would probably make for a nice winter slide spot. There were holes in the walls on both sides — one of them big enough for her to slide in — and where the facade wasn’t crumbling, ivy had claimed the stone.  
  
“Oh, come on! I’m not even the main character here! Why must I suffer this much?” Raena murmured. And she wasn’t. The book she had woken up in wasn’t about the second wife of the third prince. It wasn’t even about the first wife. It was about a pretty young slave girl called Elene who had a very hard life during the war, only to miraculously end up loved by all three princes. “So unfair!”  
  
Kara gave her a weird look, then pushed one of the doors open. A piercing screech broke the silence of the night, sending a flock of birds flying in panic. The place was empty and unkempt, with weeds and wildflowers claiming most of the front yard. There was a giant willow tree hovering between the wall and the three-story mansion, its branches spreading so tall and wide that she was sure it would cover half of the yard in its shade during the day.  
  
Her eyes stopped on the building itself and she gave it a bitter smile.   
  
“What a dump.” Raena clicked her tongue.  
  
“It’s within our expectations,” Kara noted, her voice betraying nothing. “The first wife is probably trying to show her superiority by sticking you in here. Even the third prince’s concubines have better accommodations.”   
  
“Doesn’t matter.” Raena picked up her skirt and headed toward the front door. “This place is still a few steps up from my apartment back in my world. With a little work, it will do. We’re staying here temporarily, anyway.”  
  
Raena pushed the doors of her new palace open and a flurry of dust rose in the air. Waving a hand in front of her face, she entered the gloomy anteroom, inspecting the peeling paint on the walls and dirt-covered floor. Something cracked underneath her shoe and against her better judgment, she looked down. She let out a sigh of relief as she realized it was just a mouse skeleton that had turned into another pile of rubbish.  
  
“They could have at least cleaned!” Kara growled, stopping next to her. “They knew you’d be coming here. What if you raised a ruckus after seeing the place? Or they thought just because you’re supposed to be stupid, you wouldn’t complain if you were forced to live in this wreck?”  
  
“Bringing attention to ourselves is not something we want right now.” Raena let her smile drop. She didn’t like the idea of letting them bully her, but in this case, it was necessary. Just for a little while. “Besides, once cleaned, the place won't be that bad! Spacious rooms, tall ceilings, and that wood carving — it has great potential. This used to be the most gorgeous of all the palaces.” She remembered a paragraph about it in the book where Prince Kassian was telling Elene that the North Palace was the first building in the residence and the builders spared no effort, using only the best materials and most modern interior decoration. But that was over two hundred years ago, so the current state of the place was a far cry from its former glory. “Once money starts pouring in, we’ll turn this place into something sweet. Although I am torn — if I’d be leaving it soon, I’m not sure how much I should invest in it.”  
  
“Let’s worry about that once we actually have money,” Kara said, her eye twitching as she gave the anteroom another long look. “For now, let’s get some sleep. Starting tomorrow, we’ll have a lot of work to do.",1,1746681091.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

1khi762,https://www.reddit.com/r/complaints/comments/1khi762/i_hate_elementary_teachers/,I hate elementary teachers,"I’m a 20 year old male janitor working at an elementary school since December, and honestly the things I’ve seen already make me question humanity.

In less than six months, I’ve came across willy-nilly sex toys, bottles of lube, all over in random places(places you think you would hide shit in plain sight that no one would see unless they have to move it to clean it), and mystery stains near desks that are clearly not from spilled coffee(it literally smells like pussy or a sweaty armpit and it’s a wet stain on the floor) Some of these classrooms, especially in the teacher’s offices, give off the vibe that professionalism went out the window a long time ago.

And talking to some of these teachers? It always seems to go from small talk to subtle one sided flirting from them to me, to them trauma dumping about their dead end marriages. I’m just here to clean… not to be an emotional support sponge.(I can see some of you hentai weirdos Think I’m trying to say they wanna fuck me. No, I’m just a guy who will sit there and nod their head until someone’s done talking when I’m weirded out)

The teachers bathrooms?(their private bathrooms that some teachers have as a break off section to their room) Sometimes they reek. I get it, people sit all day, they sweat, whatever, but some of the stuff I’ve had to clean off seats, floors, and even walls?(liquids that don’t look like water stains or usual piss stains) . I can tell they were gooning on the toilet(or at least that’s what I would imagine in my mind you would have to do to make the toilet fucking reek, like they were moving around rubbing their stink all over it.) That’s feral. One teacher has a private bathroom with a full-on shower, and I’m not even going to go into the stuff(not crazy over the top fucking sex dungeon dildos all over the walls I mean like shit like they will shit in the shower and leave it or not push it down the drain properly to where you can’t tell someone did this) it’s just too much

The biggest thing I’ve taken away from all this? Loneliness and nastiness don’t discriminate. Man or woman depressed, burnt out, or just plain shameless, anyone can be gross. Gender has nothing to do with it. People are people, and sometimes people are straight up Neanderthals. “all nut💦and no shame” (this isn’t as philosophical as you think I’m trying to be, I’m just saying humans are fucking nasty sometimes and have no respect)


“I edited this and added an information because some of you guys are letting your mind’s roam so much you’re creating a hentai and then blaming me for it”


Proof is on my profile that I work at a school. Some of you guys are taking this and exaggerating it. No one‘s rubbing their pussy on every surface. I’m talking about the toilet seat stinks like pussy and I can tell it’s not just from someone using the toilet properly. This isn’t some crazy hentai saga. Also, obviously not every teacher is doing this. Y’all are like exaggerating shit and then putting my name on it. I’m shocked but also relieved at how much faith you guys have in humanity, but I don’t know what to tell you. If you’re not sure what to believe whatever, but if you’re gonna be rude because you’re a weird ass has never had anything interesting happened to you. You can kiss my ass.🤌 this isn’t something I enjoy or I’m happy about. I’m looking for a new job.

Hello! I’m a 25 year old male from NYC. I’m visiting Philly this summer for a concert and i’d really be the luckiest person ever if i can find a lady out there spend the entire day with! I’m looking for someone i can treat like a girlfriend for the day. Somone i can compliment and be affectionate with too: Holding hands, hugging, hopefully kissing and if we truly connect, maybe even further than that. I’m sure this might sound insane but I’m hoping somone out there might be up for this:) 

My idea/plan:

We can talk for a bit on reddit and see if we click. I’d be happy to move to other socials. as for the concert day, It would be awesome to make it out there and meet you somewhat early on the 28th, which is a monday. We can get coffee/breakfast, talk, and just enjoy each other’s company while getting to know each other, or even just be totally unserious and talk about the most pointless things. Honestly I just love and want to listen to you talk! 

I love collecting records, checking out vintage/antique shops and breweries. I also love trying out new lunch spots, restaurants, and cocktail bars! If there are any great museums, parks, hikes or just your favorite spot to go to on a day off to chill, I want you to take me there! Also if you know of any places and spots that have anything to do with the list above, I’d love to hear your recommendations! 
An early dinner before the show would be cool but we can play it by ear.

So i’ll be getting an air bnb for the night and staying in town. I know that an entire day of doing stuff and a whole night of live music will probably be tiring, However if you’re somone who’d like to go out for drinks and hang after the show then I think we’d have a great night! 

If we feel that we really connect, i’m totally open to seeing where our night takes us. I’m sure we’ll have af pretty good idea of where we’re at by the end of the night so we can totally just feel it out. But I won’t force or pressure anything and ask that of you as well. 

If you feel comfortable and we end up spending the night together, we can definitely stay at my air bnb, unless you’d prefer we go to your place. 

Sorry for the really long post! If anyone is interested i’d love to hear from you and please feel free to ask me any and all questions so we talk about whether or not we should meet and spend the day together. I know there are some details missing from my post too so just reach out and i’ll be transparent about whatever your may be thinking. Last thing is, Though i don’t expect this, i’d be open to a long term relationship if we feel that we truly connect that much. 


Thanks for reading! Please reach out and let’s get to know each other before we meet! I can’t wait to meet the right gal out there, I hope to hear from you:) ",1,1746680701.0,phillymeetups,0,1.0,False

I started thinking about the 'invisible' reasons behind my choice. Maybe it's the familiarity and routine? We all kinda crave that comfort, right? Like, same barista who knows your order or the cozy corner where I can sit and just blend in. Plus, the aesthetics... there's something about the string lights and wooden tables that feels like home, if you get what I mean.

Could it also be that subtle sense of belonging? I notice regulars here, and even if we never speak, there's this unspoken community vibe. And let's not forget about smells—like, I'm pretty sure the aroma of freshly baked pastries is a huge factor! It's not just about caffeine; it seems like I’m coming for a bigger mix of comfort, connection, and that little escape from the everyday grind.

When it comes to home decor, few styles capture the essence of tranquility and relaxation like coastal chic. This design aesthetic brings the beach indoors, evoking images of sandy shores, rolling waves, and airy sea breezes. Whether you live by the sea or just want to escape to a coastal paradise every day, creating a coastal chic living room is a great way to infuse your space with a refreshing vibe. In this article, we will explore 25 stunning coastal chic living room ideas to inspire your next interior design project.

  
1. Soft Color Palette

  
One of the hallmarks of coastal chic decor is a soft color palette. Think sandy beiges, ocean blues, and seafoam greens. This gentle combination of hues creates an atmosphere that feels both soothing and welcoming.

  
How to Achieve the Look

  
: Paint your walls in a light, airy color such as soft white or pale blue. Use throw pillows, area rugs, and curtains in complementary shades.

  
2. Natural Textures

  
Incorporate natural materials like jute, rattan, driftwood, and linen to add texture and depth to your living room.

  
How to Achieve the Look

  
: Opt for jute or sisal area rugs, rattan furniture, and linen throw blankets. Hang driftwood art or decorations for a rustic touch.

  
3. Nautical Accents

  
Nautical themes work beautifully in coastal chic settings. From ropes to anchors, these accents evoke the maritime spirit of the sea.

  
How to Achieve the Look

  
: Integrate small nautical decor items, such as anchor art, rope-wrapped vases, or seashell collections to enhance the theme.

  
4. Light and Airy Fabrics

  
Choose lightweight fabrics that let in light and evoke a breezy feel. Sheer curtains, linen sofas, and cotton cushions add to the coastal charm.

  
How to Achieve the Look

  
: Select sheer or light-filtering window treatments and cover sofas with light-colored, breathable fabrics like cotton or linen.

  
5. Ocean-Inspired Artwork

  
Art pieces inspired by the sea can become stunning focal points in your living room. Consider marine-themed prints, watercolors, or landscape photography.

  
How to Achieve the Look

  
: Hang large-scale ocean landscapes or abstract sea-themed art to instantly draw attention and create a focal point.

  
6. Comfortable Seating

  
Comfort is key in a coastal chic living room. Opt for plush sofas and chairs that invite relaxation and conversation.

  
How to Achieve the Look

  
: Choose oversized, plush sofas in neutral fabrics, complemented by cozy throw pillows and a knitted throw blanket.

  
7. Bright Lighting

  
Well-placed lighting can brighten up your space. Look for fixtures that resemble pebbles, shells, or driftwood.

  
How to Achieve the Look

  
: Use table lamps with natural materials or pendant lights that mimic the shape of seashells to enhance the coastal feel.

  
8. Indoor Plants

  
Bring a touch of nature indoors with lush greenery. Plants can infuse your home with life and create a refreshing air quality.

  
How to Achieve the Look

  
: Choose low-maintenance indoor plants like snake plants, succulents, or palm trees and place them in decorative pots.

  
9. Sky Blue Accents

  
Incorporate different shades of blue to mimic the ocean and sky. Use throw pillows, rugs, and artwork in these colors.

  
How to Achieve the Look

  
: Add various textures and patterns in blue throughout your living room decor to create visual harmony.

  
10. Whitewashed Furniture

  
Whitewashed furniture fits perfectly within a coastal chic aesthetic and lends a relaxed yet sophisticated look to your space.

  
How to Achieve the Look

  
: Look for reclaimed wood coffee tables, bookshelves, or side tables that have a distressed or white-painted finish.

  
11. Beachy Centerpieces

  
A stunning centerpiece can tie together your living room decor. Opt for something that reflects the coastal theme, like a shell collection or driftwood arrangement.

  
How to Achieve the Look

  
: Create a centerpiece using glass jars filled with sand and shells, or a driftwood sculpture, and place it on your coffee table.

  
12. Open Layout

  
An open layout helps recreate the breezy, connected feeling of coastal living. If possible, consider minimizing barriers between spaces.

  
How to Achieve the Look

  
: Rearrange furniture to create a flow between your living room and dining area. Avoid heavy, bulky pieces that obstruct views.

  
13. Layered Lighting

  
Use a variety of lighting sources to create ambiance. Combine floor lamps, table lamps, and wall sconces to offer flexibility.

  
How to Achieve the Look

  
: Incorporate dimmable lights and place them strategically to highlight different areas of the room.

  
14. Coastal-Inspired Pillows

  
Throw pillows are an easy and impactful way to introduce coastal chic styles without significant investments.

  
How to Achieve the Look

  
: Mix and match pillows with various patterns and textures, such as stripes, floral designs, and textiles that resemble the ocean.

  
15. Coastal Gallery Wall

  
Create a gallery wall with photographs, art, and even family memories that reflect your connection to the coast.

  
How to Achieve the Look

  
: Use frames with natural finishes and arrange your art in a cohesive, yet casual manner for a curated but homey feel.

  
16. Focal Point Furniture

  
Consider adding a statement piece, like a vibrant, colored armchair or a patterned ottoman, to become the focal point of your living room.

  
How to Achieve the Look

  
: Find a piece that stands out—perhaps in coral or turquoise—and position it to draw the eye upon entering the room.

  
17. Ocean-Inspired Accessories

  
Small decorative items can bring life and character to your living room. Look for accessories that evoke the ocean.

  
How to Achieve the Look

  
: Incorporate coral sculptures, fish-shaped vases, or lanterns to add charm and character around your space.

  
18. Textured Wallpaper

  
If you’re looking for a bolder statement, consider textured wallpaper that mimics the look of wood, textured sand, or ocean waves.

  
How to Achieve the Look

  
: Choose wallpaper in soft colors and natural patterns, like wave motifs or subtle nautical touches.

  
19. Wood Beams and Ceilings

  
If your space allows, exposed wooden beams can immediately introduce a feeling of warmth and a rustic beach house ambiance.

  
How to Achieve the Look

  
: If structural changes are possible, you can add beams to the ceiling, or use faux beams for a similar effect without heavy remodeling.

  
20. Cozy Fireplaces

  
Incorporate a fireplace to create a warm, inviting atmosphere, perfect for chilly beach nights or cozy evenings at home.

  
How to Achieve the Look

  
: Opt for a shiplap or whitewashed stone finish on the fireplace to maintain the coastal vibe.

  
21. Coastal Themed Rugs

  
Add interest underfoot with area rugs featuring coastal motifs or in sea-inspired colors.

  
How to Achieve the Look

  
: Choose a rug that features watercolors, fish designs, or simply in shades of blue or beige.

  
22. Vintage Finds

  
Thrift stores often carry unique finds that can resonate with the coastal aesthetic. Look for vintage lanterns, maps, or nautical instruments.

  
How to Achieve the Look

  
: Incorporate a few curated vintage pieces to add character and history to your coastal chic living room.

  
23. Blending Old and New

  
Mix modern furnishings with vintage coastal decor to create a layered and eclectic look.

  
How to Achieve the Look

  
: Pair contemporary furniture with vintage accessories to strike a balance between old-world charm and modern aesthetics.

  
24. Beach Comber’s Corner

  
Dedicate a small corner of your living room to display your beach finds, such as shells, driftwood, and beachy decor.

  
How to Achieve the Look

  
: Use a decorative table or shelf to showcase your beach collections, creating a personal touch to your decor.

  
25. Fresh Scents

  
Incorporate fresh scents reminiscent of the seaside to enhance the ambiance of your living room.

  
How to Achieve the Look

  
: Use candles or diffusers with scents like sea breeze, coconut, or ocean waves to evoke the feel of paradise at home.

“Clara, pleeease,” Merry-Beth whined as she pouted perfectly painted red lips and batted thick false lashes at her older sister.  “I leave for Bali in the morning and God knows how long I’ll be there.”  
  
“You’ll be there 8 days,” Clara didn’t look up from her computer as she willed something urgent to jump from the screen and suck her into it so she could avoid this lunch date with her sister. However, Beatrice, her administrative assistant extraordinaire had inadvertently thrown her under the bus by declaring in front of Merry-Beth that her one o’clock had cancelled and now she was free for the rest of the afternoon. Expletives that would make her grandfather roll in his grave reverberated through her brain and she closed her grey eyes and then looked back at the screen. Still, nothing jumped from the calendar to save her. “Where is this place again?”  
  
“Manhattan,” Merry-Beth clapped her hands excitedly and kicked her feet as if she was still five-years old and getting that pony she always wanted. “It’s a brand new restaurant and the chef is a James Beard award winner and I met him the other night at Consuela’s birthday gathering. He was so lovely, and he said any time I wanted a seat at his table to just ring him up and he’d get it for me. His brother is some kind of restaurant mogul. Both are chefs but I only met Raoul. I don’t even know the other guy’s name, but I have Raoul’s number right here and I’ll call him now.”  
  
Clara stared at her sister and wondered when she’d pause for air. The words just coming out of her mouth, and she was sure she hadn’t so much as had an intake of air. As her sister giggled into her cell phone asking for Raoul and identifying herself as Merry-Beth Winchester, “yes, that Merry-Beth Winchester,” Clara rolled her eyes. Having a sister who was a world-famous supermodel took the spotlight off her and she was fine with that. Different fathers had produced different genes and as Jerry, Mother’s fourth husband had once declared, the girls were like chalk and cheese. Merry-Beth had high angular cheekbones, a straight flawless nose, eyes as blue as cornflowers in summer and hair of long golden ringlets that were her trademark in a tough industry. She was a lithe six feet in height with an enviable size zero waistline. She was a head turner. Clara was glad because it meant all eyes were focused on the goddess and not on her.   
  
Merry-Beth was no dummy. She traded on her looks and the flirtatious act she developed was often great camouflage for a hard nose for business and she used that blonde stereotype to her advantage. Sometimes though, she forgot it was an act and the vacuous empty-headed babble that would creep into their conversations would make Clara’s skin crawl. Clara had no time for pretenses and falsehoods. She was who she was and if someone didn’t like it, they could piss off.  
  
She sighed as she bent down and pulled her purse out of the bottom drawer of her desk and then locked her computer screen. Her sister had secured the best seat in the house at Pygmalion. Clara wouldn’t lie, she’d never heard of the place. Being the CEO of her grandfather’s multi-billion-dollar tech company had made her one of the wealthiest women in the world, but it had also taken a lot of her life and the little free time she did have was invested in the activities that only a select few individuals would ever know about. Dining out, clubbing, and traveling to exotic locations were not high on her priority list.   
  
“Oh my God, I’m so excited,” Merry-Beth swung her long legs and got out of the leather back chair with a practiced grace and poise.  “I may end up eating everything on the menu.”  
  
Clara followed her sister silently out of the office shooting her admin a scowl.  Beatrice shrugged and offered an apologetic smile. She had known as soon as she had opened her mouth that she had messed up, but she couldn’t take it back and Clara knew it wasn’t her fault.  She would forgive her but not right now. Right now, she was unable to come up with a valid excuse to avoid spending time with her sister. It wasn’t that she didn’t like spending time with her sister. They were close as two sisters with a ten-year age gap could be. They just lived in very different worlds and had very different ideas of success. They shared little common ground apart from both equally having little, if any, respect for the woman that birthed them.  Their mother and their disdain for her lifestyle was the one thing that caused them both the same anxieties and irritations. One phone call from her could send them both spinning, and Clara knew the trauma that came from sharing their mother is what made them closer.  
  
Merry-Beth was still yammering on about Raoul and his impressive resume of restaurants he’d worked for and the accolades he’d garnered in his career. Something about a thirty under thirty and one of the youngest to ever win the James Beard award was the last thing Clara heard as she tried to focus on breathing as she entered the elevator. She knew her security team was waiting at the bottom floor and would accompany them anywhere they went. It was something her grandfather had insisted upon when she became CEO and truthfully, she didn’t have the heart to tell him it was unnecessary. The less he knew the better.  As the doors opened with a pinging sound and they stepped into the bright sunshine filled lobby of Draxton Enterprises, they were immediately flanked by Ben and Todd, two supersized behemoth men that would accompany them everywhere they went this afternoon. Clara knew size didn’t matter when it came to protecting oneself. She had a team of women who could take these two down without them even knowing they were in the room. But having them close at hand made her grandfather happy and so she tolerated it.  
  
The car was waiting, and the driver averted his eyes as Merry-Beth slid into the seat, her short skirt sliding higher than appropriate, and Clara rolled her eyes as the sound of paparazzi started screaming Merry-Beth’s name trying to get her attention. No doubt, someone just got a great angular shot and Clara would be buying another set of intimate photos of her sister’s privates from some unscrupulous asshole to avoid them being printed.  She looked at Ben, “Find out who got that photo and get me the SIM card.” It wasn’t a request and Ben didn’t pause as he spoke into his cuff and instructed whoever his security underling was to find the paparazzi and get the card. Money was no object when it came to protecting her sister and Clara was pretty sure God himself could be bought with the interest from her bank account.  
  
Merry-Beth had gone quiet as they got into the car. She stared out the window for several minutes before turning apologetic eyes to Clara. “Sorry, as soon as I slid, I knew…”  
  
Clara waved her off. “Ben is on it. The photo will never see the light of day.”  
  
“Sometimes, I think I have it all together and then I do something stupid like that and I worry the acorn didn’t fall far enough from the tree.” Merry-Beth rubbed her forehead as if it throbbed.  
  
Clara took her sisters hand between hers. “You’re nothing like Mother. You are kind and loving and smart as hell. Never, ever compare yourself to her.” Grey eyes bored into blue ones. “What just happened was an accident, ill-timed and unfortunate. Mother would have planned that down to making sure her favorite cameraman was there and ensuring the photo was in every rag by dinner. You’re nothing alike.”  
  
Merry-Beth smiled at her older sister. Clara was always looking out for her, taking care of her, and protecting her. She hoped by the time she was thirty, she would have some of the wisdom her sister had. As her sister smiled reassuringly at her, the scar that ran along her cheekbone lifted high into her temple area and Merry-Beth was reminded yet again that her sister had killed for her, not once but three times. There was nothing Clara wouldn’t do for her. Nothing.   
  


# Chapter 2

Elian growled at his brother, his dark brown eyes almost black with his anger. “You need to stop promising every pretty face a table. What am I supposed to do now, kick out good paying customers?” He ran his fingers through his thick curly hair, frustration causing him to pull it out of it's typical, neat and tidy appearance  
  
Raoul waved his knife nonchalantly in the air. “You’re the hospitality guru, figure it out. She’s a world-famous model. Her face is all over the place. She’s plastered all over Times Square right now! Having her face in our restaurant is good PR. You’re only mad because she called me directly instead of booking a table but if you want to turn that one week wait time for a table into a month long wait with the rich and famous lining out the door, then you need to find a way to squeeze her in.” He paused, “it’s two people. Just her and her sister she said. Surely you can find a table out there.”  
  
It wasn’t that his brother was wrong, it was that his brother had no idea that he had been curating the clientele in this restaurant for months, almost eleven of them. He wanted an exclusive clientele of elite patrons who would enhance the atmosphere of The Pygmalion, not detract from it like B class reality television stars and teenage models who would be on their phones for i\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*: rather than enjoying the experience he had set to provide. “I’ve never heard of her. She can’t be that famous.”  
  
Raoul stopped what he was doing and looked at his brother incredulously. “Do you live under a rock? Merry-Beth Winchester? Blonde, blue-eyed, legs for days? Face is on the huge billboard on Times Square and pretty much every other commercial you see on the television? She’s in line to do a movie with that action star that was a wrestler?”  
  
“You just described every Hollywood starlet in boring detail.” Elian rolled his eyes.   
  
“I don’t care. Find her a table. It can’t be too hard for you to find a table for a guest and potential friend of mine. If it was a friend of yours, the table would already be set, drinks poured, and orders taken.” Raoul went back to inspecting the fish that had arrived earlier that morning. “I’m a busy man and if you want quality food out there for your exclusive clientele,” he said the last part in high-pitched mockery, “then you’ll seat my friend at a nice table.”  
  
Elian slammed his fist against the stainless-steel counter and glowered at his brother who was holding his gaze with his own stubborn will. “I have ten restaurants all over the world, six of them with Michelin stars. Why I ever thought it a smart idea to go into business with my kid brother I’ll never know.” He saw his brother’s raised eyebrows and shook his head. “Fine, I’ll find them a spot, but next time run it by me. You can hide back here in the kitchen and not see the issues that arise from pushing someone’s reservation but at the end of the day, it’s my reputation on the line.”  
  
Raoul knew his brother better than anyone and knew very well that reputation or not, he always had a table ready for a surprise guest. His brother anticipated every move of his patrons, knew them by name, researched their wants, needs and preferences and made sure that nary a napkin was ever out of place.  It was rumoured that he once changed an entire evening’s menu on a chef because one of his elite customers had recently discovered a shellfish allergy. It was that kind of attention that garnered him a reputation in the hospitality business. Once he had a chef quit due to the demands, he put on them and Elian had simply thrown an apron on, prepared the dinner service and had a new chef in line for the next morning. He was hard to work for, but he paid well and if you could make it under Elian Ruiz, then as a chef you could make it anywhere.  
  
He watched his brother shrug his shoulders under his perfectly tailored suit knowing that not a bead of sweat ran underneath. The man was cool, collected and only with his family did he ever show anything other than that façade of perfection. If any of his illustrious clientele had seen Elian yesterday rolling in the mud with his nephews playing football, they would never have believed it.   
  
Raoul walked to the front of the house and motioned to the hostess. “Jillian, my brother has a special fiend joining us for lunch service today. Please ensure they are seated at table sixteen and alert me to their presence when they arrive.” He passed her a small note with the name of the guest and saw the hostess’ eyebrows shoot up in surprise. “Problem?”  
  
“As in the Merry-Beth Winchester?” she hissed at him. The young hostess ran suddenly sweaty palms down her black skirt. “You said we’d be getting the rich and famous in here but I thought you meant like the mayor or something. Not international superstars.” She fanned her face with the note as she almost skipped away.  
  
Maybe he owed Raoul an apology and decided he would have to investigate this young woman and find out more. He watched as the hostess Jillian walked over to the bartender and gave an excited smile before holding out the paper to him. The bartender also looked at him with wide eyes. Maybe he had been living under a rock as Raoul suggested. Whoever this model was, she was apparently a hit with the younger staff in his establishment. For now, however, he had other guests to attend to.  
  
It wasn’t long before Jillian was sending him signals and he nodded to her, taking notice of the woman she preceded to table sixteen. Raoul wasn’t kidding that she had legs for days, as he’d put it. He was sure where Jillian’s armpits were, Merry-Beth’s legs were just ending. She had sharp features, angular and painted with precision in the way only a model with a team of make-up artists would look. It was apparent she was slowing her walk to not bypass the hostess. He did recognize her face now as he took her in, she was most assuredly someone he had seen before just as his brother had described.  
  
He made his way towards the table, inhaling sharply as he grew closer. It was show-time and he was all business now.  “Miss Winchester,” his voice was soft and soothing as he clasped her hands between his, “Welcome to The Pygmalion, where your experience will always exceed your expectations.”  
  
The snort from her companion took him by surprise.   
  
“Is there a problem, Miss?” he smiled politely, his façade not breaking regardless of the surprisingly rude reaction to his warm welcome.  He pulled a seat out for the guest of honor and then lifted his gaze to the companion. He drew a short breath as he took in the woman who had mocked his welcome. Grey eyes that reminded him of thunder clouds on a rainy day were a touch too close together but were sparkling as if touched by lightening. Her nose was slightly crooked as if it had once been broken, and a scar ran from her cheekbone along the fleshy part of the cheek in a thick, ragged line and it was stretched upward as she grinned widely at him. She was tiny compared to her sister, probably not even five-feet-four inches in the heels she wore but what she lacked in stature she made up for in curves; her body a perfect hourglass that caused his groin to tighten involuntarily.   
  
“No, I think your line was perfect!” Clara loved a good pun, and she couldn’t help but laugh at the obvious one. “Merry-Beth, the Pygmalion effect is a psychological phenomenon wherein someone’s ability to succeed is determined by the expectations of others around them.”  
  
Merry-Beth raised an eyebrow at her sister. “So, as an example, your success at running your grandfather’s company because of the expectations he heaped on you?”  
  
Clara groaned and scowled. “Good example but thanks for taking the fun out of the pun.” She looked at the man staring at her and immediately was aware of her scars and broken features. She had forgotten herself for a moment and was suddenly embarrassed. Usually, she let her sister have the spotlight and rarely spoke to anyone when they were out. Merry-Beth commanded an audience and Clara preferred it that way. Something about his delivery had made her forget for just a moment and now he was staring, and she was uncomfortable. A four-letter curse word invaded her thoughts as she quickly sat in the seat, he held out for her.   
  
She gripped the water glass that the hostess filled for her and sipped it quickly lubricating her now parched throat and nodding a quick agreement to whatever he had just suggested for their meals. She looked up at his back as he departed the table and headed towards the kitchen. She groaned and slapped her hands over her face. “I’m such an idiot.” She hissed at her sister  
  
Elian grinned as he overheard the comment as he headed into the kitchen and went to find his brother.  He leaned on the counter, his backside resting against the edge. “You didn’t tell me she had a little sister.”  
  
Raoul grimaced. “She has an older sister, not a younger one.”  
  
“No, I mean little,” he held his hand to his chest. “She’s bite-sized.” He licked his lips and wiggled his eyebrows suggestively.  
  
Raoul stared at his brother incredulously. Elian never behaved like this at work.  “You can’t be serious. Thirty minutes ago, you were ready to tear my head off for inviting her here and now you want to bed her sister?”  
  
Elian slapped his brother on the shoulder. “I’m not going to bed her. I’m going to marry her.” Just saying it out loud had him setting goals that he never knew he wanted.  
  
Raoul dropped his knife on the floor. “What did you just say?”  
  
Elian pushed off the counter and winked at his brother. “I’ve just met the future Mrs. Elian Ruiz and come hell or high water; I’m going to marry that woman and spend the rest of my days making her snort-laugh like she just did. She’s perfect.” He chortled as he remembered the sound of her snorting at him. She was glorious.  
  
“You’re insane. Are you sick?” Raoul wondered if someone had spiked his brother’s coffee.  “Elian,” he called out to his brother, but it was no use, Elian had gone back to the front of the house and Raoul stood there, his knife still on the floor, wondering what the hell had just happened to his stick-in-the-mud brother.",1,1746680338.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

1khhz9x,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1khhz9x/someones_wife_someone_toy/,Someone's wife someone toy,"The business conference crackled in the glass-walled convention center, a swarm of suits and briefcases clogging the air with ambition. The seminar room was jammed, professionals hunched over branded notepads under buzzing fluorescent lights that cast sharp shadows. She sat beside me, a stranger, about 36, her presence like a lit fuse. Her navy pencil skirt gripped her hips, the hem riding high to show smooth, tanned thighs in sheer stockings, the nylon glinting faintly. Her cream silk blouse hugged her curves, one button loose, teasing the edge of a lacy white bra. Her gold wedding ring flashed on her left hand, a blatant mark of her husband. Her jasmine perfume, sharp and intoxicating, clashed with the room’s stale carpet and burnt coffee stench.
The speaker’s voice slogged through revenue charts, a dull buzz beneath clinking mugs, rustling agendas, and murmured side-chats. Laptops whirred, and a projector fan hummed. Across the room, three guys in crisp shirts glanced over—one smirking, another nudging his buddy, their eyes lingering on her legs, her blouse’s open button. They sensed the heat she radiated, their gazes sharp and greedy.
I leaned in, pretending to eye her agenda, her loopy handwriting already smudged with sweat. Her skin’s warmth hit me, sweet and musky under her perfume, her citrus shampoo biting my nose. Before my hand even moved, I whispered, my voice a low growl, barely audible over the speaker’s drone. “Your husband know you’re sitting here, looking like a slut for strangers?” Her pen froze, her breath catching, a tiny gasp swallowed by the room’s chatter. Her eyes stayed on her paper, but a hot flush crept up her neck, pink against her pearl necklace. “Bet he’d hate knowing you’re wet already, with all these guys watching,” I murmured, my lips close to her ear, her diamond stud brushing my cheek. Her ring glinted as her hand shook, her nails clicking on her pen. The three watchers grinned, one tapping his pen, catching the tension in her posture.
Her knee brushed mine under the glossy mahogany table as she shifted, the slick nylon of her stockings rasping against my suit pants. The contact sent a jolt through me, my cock twitching at the thought of her cheating. Her eyes flicked to me, dark with heat, and I pushed further. “You gonna let me touch you, or just tease your husband’s ring like a bad wife?” I whispered, my breath hot on her earlobe. Her flush deepened, her lips parting silently, the watchers’ eyes narrowing as they caught her arm’s subtle shift.
My hand slid under the table, gripping her thigh—silky stockings over taut, warm flesh, the nylon slick but thin enough to feel her pulse hammering. I squeezed hard, my fingers sinking into her softness, kneading slow circles, her skin yielding like warm dough. Her breath hitched again, louder, almost too loud. “Keep writing, or they’ll know you’re cheating,” I growled, my voice rough. My hand pushed under her skirt, the tight fabric scraping my knuckles, rough and binding. Her thighs blazed, heat pouring through her stockings and panties. My fingers found her silk underwear, drenched and clinging to her pussy, the wet fabric cool but her flesh scorching. I pressed the damp spot, feeling her throb, her slick warmth coating my fingertips. She spread her thighs wider, a reckless move that hiked her skirt higher, her stocking tops peeking out. The guys across the room leaned forward, one licking his lips, their eyes locked on her legs, her trembling hand.
Her hand moved fast, bold. Her fingers grazed my thigh, then slid up, cupping the bulge in my suit pants. She squeezed my cock, her palm hot and firm through the fabric, making me harden instantly, the zipper straining. Her touch was confident, her fingers tracing the thick shaft, slow and teasing, the pressure tightening my balls. Her wedding ring felt ice-cold against my thigh, a sharp sting beside her warm hand. She unzipped me halfway, her fingers diving inside, wrapping around my bare cock—smooth, hot, her grip tight and slick with my precum. The ring scraped my shaft, a cold bite that made me throb harder. The three watchers stared, two smirking wider, one whispering to his buddy, their eyes catching her hand’s rhythm under the table, the faint rasp of my zipper barely masked by a chair creak.
I pulled her panties aside, my fingers sliding along her pussy—dripping, soft like hot cream, her slickness thick and musky, sharp in the air. I spread her, my middle finger circling her entrance, her pulse pounding. I pushed inside, her tight walls clutching me, warm and pulsing like a drum. I curled my finger, rubbing the rough, spongy spot that made her hips buck, her skirt creaking loudly. Her hand sped up on my cock, stroking fast, her fingers sticky with precum, the wet sound of her palm risky under the table. My other hand reached over, faking a grab for her conference badge, but I pressed her chest. Her blouse was slick, cool silk, her breast heavy and hot, the nipple stiff as a pebble through her bra. I pinched it hard, rolling it, feeling it pulse under my thumb. She coughed, covering a choked moan, her eyes glassy, nearly wild.
I added a second finger, stretching her pussy, her juices gushing, soaking her panties and stockings, dripping onto the carpet with a faint, treacherous patter. My thumb found her clit, swollen and slick, rubbing tight, frantic circles, her pulse racing. Her thighs quaked, muscles clenching, her stockings rasping against my wrist. “Your husband’s gonna hear how you stroked me while they watched,” I whispered, my breath scorching her ear, her pearl necklace clicking as she trembled. “You’re such a dirty wife, coming for a stranger in public,” I growled, my fingers pumping her pussy, the slick squelch louder, daring the room to notice. Her hand faltered on my cock, shaking, but she kept stroking, her ring glinting with every slick pump. The watchers’ grins vanished, their eyes wide, one gripping his mug too hard, the others frozen, thrilled by the risk.
I kneaded her breast harder, squeezing its soft weight, tugging her nipple until it throbbed. “You’re gonna get us busted, coming like a whore with his ring on,” I hissed, my voice low, the citrus tang of her hair sharp in my nose. I pulled my fingers out, her wetness shining like gloss, and spanked her pussy—my palm smacking her clit with a wet, sharp slap that echoed faintly. She jolted, her hand squeezing my cock so hard I pulsed, her nails biting my shaft. The sound was too loud, drawing a glance from a woman nearby, but it faded into a laptop’s click. The three guys gasped softly, one nudging another, their eyes locked on her twitching hips. “Your husband ever make you this wet, or just leave you for strangers to fuck?” I whispered, spanking her again, her pussy swelling, sticky and blazing, her hips grinding into my hand. Her strokes on my cock turned desperate, her fingers drenched, the zipper grinding louder.
I plunged my fingers back in, deeper, pumping fast, her juices flooding my wrist, soaking her skirt’s hem and pooling under her. My thumb mashed her clit, rubbing in sync. “Come for me, not him, right where they’ll tell everyone,” I growled, lips grazing her earlobe, her diamond stud cold against my skin. Her body locked up, thighs clamping my hand, and she came—her pussy spasming, gripping my fingers like a trap, her hot, wet pulses drenching me. Her hand froze on my cock, nails digging in, her lips pressed tight to choke a whimper. Her agenda ripped under her other hand, her ring flashing like a beacon. The watchers leaned back, one nodding slowly, another adjusting his tie, their eyes alight with the secret, their silence a thin shield.
I eased my fingers out, her slickness dripping, and wiped them on her stocking, leaving a dark, glistening streak. She zipped me up, her fingers lingering on my cock, sticky and hot, before pulling away. I squeezed her breast one last time, feeling its heat mold to my palm, then sat back. She glanced at me, face flushed scarlet, eyes foggy with lust, lips swollen from biting them. The three guys smirked, their pens moving but their eyes still darting to us, whispering faintly. Her wedding ring shone, a stark brand of her betrayal, the thrill of being watched and cheating pulsing like wildfire as the speaker droned on, clueless.

Later in the day, one of their cars crashed out and had a bunch of salvaged parts. The mechanic let me take the wheel tire from the crash as a souvenir, which is pretty sweet and I’ve been thinking of ways to use it. I’ve seen engine blocks and chairs used as furniture so I figured why not turn this wheel and tire into a coffee table! I cleaned it up and got a glass top for it and it looks pretty sick. Thought I’d share with the group.

1khhytf,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1khhytf/how_do_you_recover_faster_after_a_narcissistic/,How do you recover faster after a narcissistic attack?,"Some background: I currently live with my n-mom. I have been coping by picking up more hours at work and saving money. Planning on how I will get out of here for good. My company has been cutting payroll for hourly workers this year, because of various reasons. I've talked with all of my managers, and they just can't accommodate more work hours right now. So I am spending a lot more time at home. My n-mom is retired, so she's always home. 

Things were going better for a few weeks. I live mostly on an opposite schedule from her. I try to be awake while she is asleep. I've even set my room up, so I can prepare some basic meals and not have to go into the kitchen (it sounds sad, but I know some people here will understand how hungry and thirsty you get when they have you afraid to even leave your room). I have spent my time with less work focusing on catching up on projects outside of work, cleaning, getting my car fixed, doctor's appointments, searching for a better career path, because retail in this economy is not going to cut it. I feel like I am doing better despite some set backs. Plus setting physical distance from my mom, even though we are stuck in the same house has de-escalated things for the most part. 

This morning, I usually try to get to my room before she wakes up. I just slacked and didn't make it in time. I was on the couch in the living room reading, and she got in the arm chair to drink her coffee. Started telling me about how much trouble she has had sleeping, how many nightmares she's been having, and how ""worried"" she is for me and my future. And you all know where the, ""I'm worried about you"" with a narcissist goes. I never can pinpoint how it escalates, but it went on for nearly two hours, and ended with her telling me she's done with me, and I need to find a way to get out, which I'm trying to do. I need to plan it time out correctly, and ending the financial abuse means I will have to have a lot of money saved up. I have left before, but ended up back, and it's because of the money, and how hard it is to get into a stable career with a chronic illness. 

Anyway, the whole encounter left me fairly shaken and emotionally raw. I am her scapegoat, her favorite punching bag. It's like she needed to squeeze 3 months of supply out of me all at once, since I've been avoiding her more lately. She really needs to make up for all that lost time. I'm so mad at myself that I stayed downstairs this morning. 

How do you recover from one of their attacks faster? It usually takes days to feel less hurt, shaky, hyper-vigilant, and nervous after one of their emotional assaults. I hear every footstep and door open or close. My adrenaline maxes out until I crash. Then I sleep a lot. I feel like my hours getting cut at work have had not just a financial, but a major drain on my emotional health. Even though I don't really like my job, I am safer there than I am at home. So being there less has been really hard for me. 

My local library is under renovation, I used to love going there. I'm trying hard to save money, so I'm trying to avoid places that require money like going to the movies, and I don't want to spend money I'm trying to save on a motel for a few days of reset. I wanted to get active in some protests or in my union, but I just don't have the physical stamina right now. Plus, she'll want to know why I'm not home, and she wants regular text updates, and when I'll be home. Or she'll text me all of the hell she is going through while she's home alone. I do have her notifications silenced, but I have cats, so I can't completely block her when I'm not home. Sometimes I try just sitting in my car in the driveway, and she finds me. Physical distance from her works pretty well. I do have the self care down pretty good, but it's harder to do after an attack, because I want to stay hidden in my room. I try to watch a movie or show on Netflix, and I feel like every little gesture of love or kindness in a storyline makes me cry. I am so isolated, she's turned my sisters and the whole town against me. I want to feel less vulnerable and like I've metaphorically been ripped to pieces.

I even went in and reprogrammed their brains so that both of them would be into it. Seems like a sure thing, right? 

Of course not. 

The first thing I did was have Izzy go to a local bar near where Johnny lives. I didn't tell him why. I just told him to order a drink, and once he was loosened up, I told him to get out on the dance floor. 

Then I switched my attention to Johnny Zest. I instructed him to go to the same bar, and when he got there, he saw Izzy and immediately walked up to say hello. Unfortunately, Izzy decided he was going to walk home from the bar after one drink. I don't know, maybe it just wasn't his scene. But before I could stop him, he had left. So I had Johnny hit the dance floor after turning on his favorite music, then turned my attention to Izzy again. Send him back to the bar. This time, as he was walking in, Johnny was walking out.

Not to be deterred, I had Izzy visit Johnny at his home. Johnny had recently redecorated with some flirty paintings, so I thought the two of them could finally handle things from there. 

But apparently, I am not omniscient. The flirting became so embarrassing and disastrous that while they became fast friends, their romance level went into the negative. Then, to my horror, the awkward, embarrassing flirting became so bad that their friendship level started to drop. Time for some divine intervention. I strategically placed a potion of forced friendship on the coffee table, and commanded Izzy to drink it. Now, finally, the two are best friends, but it was time for Johnny to go to work.

To escape that life, Charlotte decided to go to university to give herself the education to make it in the world. To raise the funds to do so, she chose to auction herself and her virginity to the highest bidder.  
  
James and Michael:  
  
Charlotte's 'Buyer' was James, long-term Dom, architect-engineer, divorced and stinging from his first marriage. During a madcap week of wild s\*\*\*\*l adventure (See 'Mastering the Virgin' – Box Set One -  FREE Download), James introduced Charlotte to the pleasures of b\*\*m and ménage with his old friend Michael, who 'loves women'. Blond, and unusually handsome, Michael lived the life of the 'Bachelor Free' for many years until he met Charlotte.  
  
Over time, James became Charlotte's Master. Michael became, first her 'Golden Lover', then her fiancée, and finally her husband. The three formed a Triad, now travelling through life in a three-cornered marriage.  
  
Charlotte is now pregnant by James.  
  
Mitch:  
  
Michelle Kimberley - Charlotte/Jenny's mother. Driven to escape from a suffocating childhood, Mitch ran away from home at the age of fifteen. She survived by becoming a high-class courtesan, eventually becoming involved with:  
  
Klempner:  
  
Lawrence (Larry) Klemper: ex-mercenary and human trafficker. During an affair with Mitch, before understanding the kind of man he was, she became pregnant by him. Realising too late that she was involved with a dangerous criminal, she ran, eventually marrying Klempner's friend, Frank Conners, and passing Jennifer off as his child.  
  
Klempner swore revenge, pursuing the couple. When Jennifer was two years old, Klempner captured her, imprisoning her in Blessingmoors. Mitch, believing her daughter was dead, went into hiding for over twenty years.  
  
After events in which many truths were revealed, Klempner came to understand that he had not been betrayed and gave up his revenge. Regretting his past actions, he agreed to walk out of Mitch's life and to allow her to find happiness on her own terms.   
  
Richard and Beth:  
  
Richard Haswell, billionaire property developer and Dom, owner of a significant proportion of 'The City' and first, James' employer then his co-director.  
  
Elizabeth: his wife and sub and related by blood to Charlotte.  
  
Over time, the couple have become close friends with the Triad, and now are part of a developing polyamorous marriage. Richard and James share their pleasures with Charlotte. Michael is Beth's 'second husband'.  
  
Now read on...  
  
Michael - Eleven Weeks  
  
I lie awake, an arm propped behind my head. Lying beside me; Charlotte, eyes closed, her breathing steady and slow. Beyond her, James, the rise and fall of his chest equally regular.   
  
Richard and Beth are in the next room. Perhaps they're sleeping. I'm not sure. It seems to me I sometimes hear a low murmur of words.  
  
But, my mind a-whirl, sleep escapes me.  
  
Should I get up?  
  
Make a coffee? Read perhaps...  
  
But right now, I don't want to leave the bed or my sleeping wife. For her perhaps to wake and find me not here.  
  
So, tossing and turning, I while away the darkness, watching slanted moonbeams make their slow progression across the carpet, then the bed, before finally fading. And now the first grey light of dawn creeps across the windows.  
  
A blackbird chirrups its early arpeggio; a sweet melodic prelude to the full chorus that will follow.  
  
And still my mind wheels and turns.  
  
The sheer enormity of what Richard has offered me takes my breath away.  
  
Beth.  
  
Beautiful, sweet, submissive Beth. So like my own Charlotte physically. But so unlike in her every other way.  
  
Richard's wife. His submissive. So much younger than he is.  
  
And he has... What? Bequeathed her to me?  
  
A second wife?  
  
And Charlotte says she doesn't mind. Even encourages it.  
  
As does James.  
  
Why?  
  
I roll onto my side, settling to watch my sleeping flame-haired beauty.  
  
And gradually, it dawns on me that her breathing is not the slow steady rhythm of the sleeper...  
  
She's not asleep...  
  
Pretending?  
  
""Charlotte?""  
  
Her eyes flick open. Not the gradual flutter of the slowly waking, but the snap of the already conscious. And her gaze settles on me. In the daylight, that gaze would be emerald, but now, in the early dawn, she is a pattern of light and shade; a tracery in grey, her eyes a white gleam.  
  
She shifts, crisp linen sheets rustling in the semi-dark and her hand cups my cheek. ""You okay?"" She leans in, brushing her lips over mine.  
  
""Shouldn't I be asking you that?""  
  
Her body vibrates; quiet laughter. ""I'm fine. Really, I am. Richard asked me before he spoke to you. So..."" She strokes my face. ""... Are you okay?""  
  
""I'm not sure. It's hard to put into words...""  
  
""Overwhelm?"" A glint from her teeth joins that from her eyes.  
  
""That's as good a description as any... Charlotte...""  
  
""You're not changing your mind, are you? About Beth?""  
  
""I'm... I don't know. Charlotte, are you sure you're alright about this? It's not every woman who'd be happy for her husband to have a second wife.""  
  
She chuckles. ""It's not every man who would accept that his wife has two husbands. But you're right. If it were any other woman than Beth, no, I wouldn't have accepted it."" The chuckle turns to a snort. ""I'd have scratched her freakin' eyes out."" Her voice softens. ""But it is Beth...""  
  
I reach for her, sliding an arm around her waist, pulling her, warm and yielding, to me  
  
She snuggles close, contouring herself to my body, nuzzling into the nook of my neck and shoulder. ""You smell good.""  
  
""Charlotte, I promised you on our wedding night that you would never have cause to regret marrying me.""  
  
""Yes, you did. And you never have given me cause.""  
  
""Not even now? A bit of partying with Richard and Beth on special occasions is one thing, but this...""  
  
She pulls away, leaning back so she can look me in the face. ""Have you changed your mind? Yesterday evening you agreed to it, but we were all there. If you said yes to Richard because you were feeling pressured or for the wrong reasons...""  
  
""No, I wasn't pressured. That's not it. It's... you did spring it on me. You obviously all knew about it before. You'd discussed it. I had two minutes' notice.""  
  
She sits up, knees hugging up to the slight swell of her belly, pulling the sheets to her chest. ""If you want to change your mind, you should do it sooner rather than later. Beth and Richard would understand if it happened now. Later...""  
  
""I don't want to change my mind... exactly... But I wanted to talk to you about it. Talk it through. Last night, we didn't discuss anything... There was no opportunity to discuss anything... About how it would work. Are we a... a five-some? Or are we an overlapping couple and our Triad. Who would live where? Or when we might all meet up. Or... anything...""  
  
""That's all detail.""  
  
""I know it's detail. We can work through it. But... but mainly... I have to be certain that you are alright with this.""  
  
""Michael, I've already...""  
  
I cut her off, sitting up to look her in the eye. ""Charlotte, I never expected to meet a woman where not only do I want to be faithful to her, I have no inclination to be otherwise. You never asked me to be faithful to you, but it's something I have always wanted to do for you. My gift to you. The only woman I've touched since you and I met is Beth herself, and you agreed, even encouraged that.""  
  
A finger of sunlight creeps across the carpet, the light turning from grey to golden. Her mouth twitches mischief. ""How many have you had?""  
  
""What? How many what?"" I'm protesting, pretending innocence, but I understand exactly what she's asking. I simply don't want to answer her.  
  
""Women. How many women have you had? Before me.""  
  
""I never counted.""  
  
The mischief dances into her eyes. ""You never counted your conquests?""  
  
""Women aren't conquests. And they're not numbers either.""  
  
She jerks a thumb to the sleeping James at her side. ""Marcie said that the two of you had... what were her words? 'Worked every sub within twenty miles'...""  
  
Fucking Marcie...  
  
""How about your own past?""  
  
Her forehead creases. ""What about my past? You know how we met..."" She colours up. ""The Auction...""  
  
""Yes, James bought you and he invited me in the following day. But after that week, you went to college. What happened there?""  
  
""What do you mean? What happened?""  
  
""You had no boyfriends at college? After that first week? You'd discovered you enjoyed sex.""  
  
""I... there were a couple. I had a date or two. But it never..."" She stutters to a halt.   
  
""I'm guessing it was a bit pale compared to what James and I give you?""  
  
She nods down to her knees, looking forlorn. ""Yes.""  
  
You bastard...  
  
""Babe, I'm sorry if I embarrassed you. The fact is, I have a past. Everyone does.""  
  
""Do you miss it?""  
  
""Miss what? Playing the field?""  
  
""Yes. You had so much freedom when you were single and I wondered, maybe...""  
  
""I think about it sometimes, but if by miss it, you mean, do I want to go back to that? No, I don't. I have you.""  
  
""And now Beth too.""  
  
""And now, Beth."" Framing her face with my hands, ""But that doesn't change in any way how I feel about you, or the fact that you are my wife and I am your husband.""  
  
""I know that."" She smiles, leaning in to meet me half-way and we kiss.   
  
She breaks off. ""Ahh... damn.""  
  
""What?""  
  
She pats her stomach. ""I need to pee.""   
  
I shift to let her past and she climbs out of the bed, supporting her stomach with one hand and clutching at her breasts with the other. ""I'm going to have to wear a bra in bed if these damn things get any bigger.""  
  
""They look pretty good to me. But I suspect they'll getter bigger than that. It's early days yet.""  
  
She gives me a slow look then vanishes off into the bathroom, leaving me with the 'sleeping' James.  
  
""You're not fooling me. I know you're awake.""  
  
His eyes flick open, his mouth quirking with humour. ""And have been for some time. I'll admit, I was enjoying the turn the conversation had taken. I would have liked to hear more.""  
  
""You didn't want to join in?""  
  
""You had things you needed to talk through with Charlotte.""  
  
""You could say that, yes. You shared her with me, arranged that I married her and now you've conspired to give me a second wife. Competition for her affections.""  
  
He stares up for a moment, sucking at his cheeks. ""I don't know that conspired is the right word...""  
  
""Oh, I think it is.""  
  
He sniffs. ""Alright, it is. In the same way that you and Charlotte arranged that her first child would be mine...""   
  
""That's what friends do for each other.""  
  
""And this is what friends do for each other. There's no question between you and me of competition for Charlotte's affection. There's no jealousy between her and Beth. And you're perfectly capable of giving each of them what they need and deserve. We all had good reasons for the things we did.""  
  
He sits up, scraping at a blue haze of stubble. ""No one should have to deal with what Ben did to you, for all that he convinced himself he was doing it on your behalf. Klempner had it right when he talked about betrayal.""  
  
Klempner...  
  
Wonder where he is now?  
  


# Chapter 2: Target, Part 2

Thailand  
  
At 'Arrivals', I wait, card clutched in hand: Strohmayer Party.  
  
The crowds throng by, sweeping past; wives and husbands, lovers, and teenage sweethearts meet and embrace. Men smile, shake hands and slap backs, women hug and kiss cheeks. Children, olive-skinned, dark-haired and almond-eyed run to meet smiling oldsters, arms outstretched, shrieking as they run.  
  
Nothing of this feels familiar.  
  
But then, when did anyone come running to me?  
  
My mother, a smile on her lips, laughter in her eyes, hunkering down, arms outstretched as I toddle to her, as fast as short legs will carry me... ""Larry, Sweetheart...""  
  
And Him in the background; red-faced, scowling, bleary-eyed.  
  
Enough...  
  
...  
  
...  
  
Ah... there they are...  
  
Six in the group, middle-aged, prosperous and coming to 'party'...  
  
... for a given definition of 'party'.  
  
That's got to be them.  
  
I adjust my cap to just the right angle, brush down the jacket and straighten up, making sure the card is prominent.  
  
The leader of the group is scanning the crowd. His eyes settle on the card and he looks back, jerking his chin at me. He struts across...  
  
Rich...  
  
Arrogant...  
  
Jerk...  
  
""Mr Strohmayer?""  
  
""You the chauffeur?"" His voice is a nice mix of accent and condescension.  
  
""I'm here to take you to your lodgings, sir, yes.""  
  
""Great."" He thumbs to the back of the group where one of them pushes a trolley piled with what looks like baggage for the lot of them. ""Cases are back there. You can take us to the car. Limo? As I ordered?""  
  
""Yes, sir. Everything as you ordered. Air conditioning. Drinks in the chiller. Everything for your comfort. If there is anything...""  
  
""Just get us out of this heat."" He runs a finger around his collar. ""f\*\*\*\*\*g humidity's got me already. It'd better be everything we were promised. We've paid a lot for this.""  
  
I duck my head and copy/paste my best tone of ingratiation. ""I think, sir, I can guarantee you the experience of a lifetime.""  
  
""Good. Paid a fuckin' fortune for this. I want my money's worth.""  
  
In the car - a stretch-limo as ordered; ""If there is anything else you want, sirs, or any questions, just...""  
  
""How old are they?"" pipes up one. ""I'm not looking for some sixteen-year-old claiming to be fourteen. I want the real thing.""  
  
""You can choose, sir. Whatever you want. All ages. Both sexes. Local, foreign, Western, Asian, blond, dark. You name it. You'll find it.""  
  
""How young?"" says one of them. He's got that seedy hue that comes from spending too much time indoors bending over a screen.  
  
Probably d\*\*k-less and can't pull an actual woman...  
  
""As young as you want, sir.""  
  
Dickless leans back and sighs. ""Great. I want it really tight when I...""  
  
""Alright,"" snaps Strohmayer. ""We don't want to hear it, Frischmann. Whatever you want's gonna be there. Where are we eating?""  
  
""I'm taking you there now, sir. A banquet for six laid on. A mix of traditional Thai and Western dishes as requested. Is there anything...""  
  
""Shut the f\*\*k up and give us some privacy.""  
  
""Of course, sir.""  
  
That works for me...  
  
I tap the button raising the glass screen behind me, making sure I turn my face from the rear-view so they don't see me smiling.  
  
Ain't the internet wonderful? All those people who, once, would have been so hard to find. Now, in these days of the great and glorious World Wide Web, you locate the right 'social media' on the dark-net and, Hey, Presto...  
  
I turn off the main highway and down the track through the rainforest.  
  
""What kind of hotel is this?"" spouts one. His voice echoes through the intercom, tinny and reedy. I'm not sure how much of the tone is his own voice and how much the connection, but...  
  
""Obviously sirs, even here, we have to be discreet. You understand that technically this is illegal, regardless of the realities and the consent of the children involved.""  
  
""They have consented, have they?"" It's the runt who was pushing the baggage trolley when I met them.  
  
""Or their parents have consented. Often, the children are supporting older members of their families through the work.""  
  
One of them discovers the drinks cabinet, starts splashing gin and tonic, malt and whatever else. It doesn't matter which they choose. There's enough Zolpidem in any of the bottles to incapacitate the drinkers.  
  
As they clink glasses and exchange brags, I knock down the security lock. None of them notices.",1,1746679912.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

Paying for Panera's drink program has been absolutely worth it for me in terms of minor QoL improvements. You can get hot or cold caffeine for brekkie, soda/ coffee pick me up at lunch and dinner. It feels lux/ more normal to have treats like this. I will say, it's only worth it if there are one or more on your normal route or you share an account with someone. I hate the plastic waste, but reuse the cups after washing them, or for growing plants, or for smoothies at home. 

Huge note: they put out a variety of dairy for coffees. Sometimes I just take milk for my cereal/ oatmeal. I can't finish it fast enough on my own, it's gotten mad expensive, and only need like half a cup, so I'll eat my cereal there. Sometimes they push a coupon for $1 bagels, butter is free! Ask nicely for extra, I've never seen someone charge for this! Truly, the access to fresh dairy products makes it worth it.   

Besides drinks, the other things to get: I take their to-go containers to make my life easier. Condiments ofc! Sugar, honey, salt/pepper, hot sauce, mayo... all depends on location but worth peaking at. 

They also almost always have a microwave! Invaluable to me, having a hot meal is a game changer. Use their electricity! Free charging spot where hanging out is acceptable with access to free wifi. Get to know the staff and they don't care about what you're doing as long as you are clean, quiet and polite. 

Anyways that's my very specific tip. But what do YOU pay for that's worth the splurge of money because of perks etc. 

Eta: organized a little bit better. Also, they have free trial. I additionally know someone who games the system for a discount but starting and stopping the program only when there are good promos. ",0,1746679899.0,povertyfinance,4,0.33,False

I’m thinking about picking up a pair of [Polk ES60](https://www.polkaudio.com/en-us/product/home-speakers/floor-standing/signature-elite-es60/300369.html) for my living room. My goal is to invest once in a solid, long-lasting setup, and the ES60s appeal to me because their bass extension means I can skip buying a separate subwoofer (and save some cash).

However here's my room layout:

* Overall room: **6 m × 3 m** (about **20 ft × 10 ft**)
* Usable listening area: roughly **3 m × 3 m** (≈ **10 ft × 10 ft**, \~9 m² / 100 sq ft) — the rest is a hallway that leads to the bedrooms, kitchen, and bathroom.
* Planned furniture: a **1.8 m / 6 ft-wide** media console, with the speakers flanking it and toed-in about **15–25°**. The opposite wall has a simple leather sofa and a glass-top wooden coffee table in  the middle of this space.

Given the modest size of the listening area, do you think I can still get the most out of the speakers?

My first instinct was to go with bookshelf speakers, but then I’d need a subwoofer and two nice-looking stands. Good stands aren’t cheap, and once I add everything up, the ES60s start to look like the better deal in terms of performance, aesthetics, and overall cost.

We all need to remember that we also have an wife/partner/cat/Pokémon that will need to also approve the aesthetics.

So I'm open to some recommendations, especially from anyone running tower speakers in a similarly small space. Also we plan to move to other house in some time, and the living room will probably be bigger, but that will take some years.

If your mom loves to travel, the best gifts are the ones that are both thoughtful and useful on the go. Here are some ideas that have worked well for my travel-loving mom:

* **Travel journal** \- A compact and beautifully designed journal so she can jot down her experiences, itinerary notes, or even travel quotes she loves.
* **Neck pillow and eye mask set** \- Comfort on flights or long train rides is a must, and a cute, plush set makes a great gift.
* **Skincare minis or a travel-sized beauty kit** \- Perfect for keeping her skincare routine intact without taking up much space.
* **Portable coffee mug or bottle** \- If your mom needs her chai or coffee fix wherever she goes, a high-quality, spill-proof mug is a winner.
* **Photo memory gifts** \- A personalized photo frame or scrapbook featuring snapshots from her past trips can be a sweet reminder of her adventures.
* **Organizers** \- Think cable organizers, travel pouches, or packing cubes to keep everything neat in her suitcase.
* **Gift hampers** \- A curated box with snacks, candles, beauty products, and a travel-themed item or two is always appreciated.

If you’re looking for pre-curated and aesthetic gifting options, especially for Mother’s Day, you can check out **Confetti Gifts**. They have a special collection of thoughtful gift boxes that can suit travel-loving moms - from self-care goodies to personalized items.",1,1746679377.0,u_FitDot5742,0,1.0,False

I'm so pissed off rn and it's embarrassing looking through my LinkedIn messages seeing all the fucking networking convos I've had which have been all for nothing and have made me seem like a desperate bitch. 

I bet many of them are laughing at how much effort I've put in to still get rejected. I've recently sent cold insulting replies to one place that rejected me and in the heat of the moment I told one manager to fuck off even though she liked me and was networking with me for 7 months because in the end they passed over me for the internship. 

Should I just block them or would that confirm my insecurity? 

I'm so frustrated looking at all of that wasted effort spending so many hours for those applications and interviews smh. When I've spent so much time and have been rejected after all that effort from the elite internships I've applied for it just makes me feel so angry tbh. 

Needed to vent because I'm struggling to accept I'll be inferior to my peers who went to elite undergrads and got elite jobs immediately after then went to harvard or Stanford and are working at elite PE /VC firms ffs. 

Knowing that I'll forever be be beneath them and will never be able to catch up makes me want to pick up a fucking crowbar and go on a fucking rampage man. I have nothing to lose at this point since I'll forever be in a less prestigious inferior position since I'll never get elite VC/PE like them. I don't care if I end up in prison for the rest of my life at this rate I've already ruined my fucking life by not getting into an elite career.

I don't think I ever be able to get over not getting into an elite industry and already ruining my career due to being locked out of elite careers so I have nothing to fucking lose at this point.

1khhm5w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gifts/comments/1khhm5w/help_with_mil/,Help With MIL,"My MIL is a tough person to pick a gift for and every year I struggle and am always looking for something that isn't a waste of money or junk. 

We live on opposite sides of the country so nothing in person ala ""family event to make a memory"". 

She does not garden or spend much time outside, too hot and she has bad allergies.  I have gotten bird feeders, chimes, decorations in the past 

She likes to read but uses an e-reader and typically reads from free sources. She has never indicated interest in a ""pay to read"" option. *I am thinking of the wearable ring blue tooth page flipper thing*

She doesn't do any cosmetics. None. 

She doesn't do ANYTHING scented due to preference and FIL medical issues. 

She doesn't color her hair or tie her hair back. 

She hates shoes and things on her feet. She also doesn't like bracelets or watches. Things on her wrists, even a hair tie, makes her feel strangled. 

She follows a low fod/map plus some other food rules. Ie no corn, no soy, no honey, no gluten, no tomato products, little to no dairy, no onion/garlic, etc. Prior to the diet change she was a picky eater to begin with. 

She doesnt cook much and when she does it's basic stuff due to dad's breathing issues being exacerbated by cooking smells. They have 3 seasoning in the house which are sal, pepper, and cinnamon. She also has a small ass jar of light olive oil. 

She doesn't drink coffee or tea. She only drinks water and the very  occasional soda. She has 125,000,000 water bottles and cups. 

She doesn't drink alcohol. 

She has never had a manicure, pedicure, or massage. She thinks it's weird to pay people to touch you. 

She believes gift cards are impersonal. 

She isn't a neat freak who would enjoy cleaning/organizational tools.

I never get a very enthusiastic thank you, she says thanks but it's never an excited one that tells me I knocked it out of the park. 

She loves thrift and clearance shopping so I stopped taking off the lowest price tags on whatever I get her. She gets more excited about ""the deal"" I got than the thing itself. So that is nice, most people would be embarrassed to give someone something clearly from a yard sale but she thinks those are great gifts. 

She does art, painting mostly. She is self taught and has a craft room. She also collects glass (Fenton, carnival, etc) I have gotten her an antique glass reference manual one year. 

I am sure I could list off objections all day long. She is a tough nut to crack and I pride myself on being a great gift giver. She has a giant chip on her shoulder stemming from childhood feelings of being the neglected and afterthought child (she was 1 of 4). I don't want her to feel like I just got whatever was close by or the first thing I saw on Amazon. ",2,1746678697.0,Gifts,16,0.75,False

1khhlvv,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatdoIdo/comments/1khhlvv/i_experienced_a_messy_breakup_with_someone_at/,"I experienced a messy breakup with someone at work, and suspect she’s trying to isolate me from colleagues. How to proceed?","I dated someone in my PhD cohort on a casual basis for approximately 5 months, before coming to the realization that I cannot manage casual with this individual, as she alternated emotional intensity and aloofness in a way that I found confusing and conducive to inner disarray. I also had some reservations as to our compatibility early on, but never firmly acted on them (despite alluding to them regularly) because I felt the potential for a rare bond, and was under the impression, based on deeds that appeared to contradict nonchalant language, that she valued me in a unique manner. Approximately three months ago, the alternating intimacy and distance, coupled with my accumulated resentments, culminated in my inquiring as to whether she saw us moving toward anything more solidified in the near future. Her answer was vague and evasive, so I announced a desire to distance myself, as I found casual unbearable (I left out that I came to care less and less for, and felt more and more hurt by, some of her habits the more I got to observe her behavioural patterns, as this seemed unnecessary and potentially inflammatory.) 

I felt confident in the decision: she was at a place where she wanted to focus on herself and be hedonistic, and I wanted to find commitment in the next couple of years, so our goals were simply incompatible. Plus, she had taken an interest in other people, as she’d gone on at least one other date that she confirmed and flirted pretty openly with others, and, disenchanted with her roving eye, I’d pursued a few other possibilities myself (albeit reluctantly: she had my heart, ultimately.) We both seemed fine with it ending. 

However, after inviting me to a sit-down coffee in the aftermath of that “breakup” conversation, she came over to my apartment and we were intimate, the lone difference being some awkward conversation in between bouts of activity during which we both claimed to feel “conflicted.” What I recall her asking was whether I might “be patient.” Because I felt utterly spellbound by her, despite my rational misgivings, I clung to that seeming indication that with a brief interlude in which she attended to her mental health, we might pursue something legitimate in the years to come (I now see my hope as naive, and more than a little pathetic.)

After that evening together, all signs of continued affection seemed to evaporate, with her ignoring me altogether when we saw one another, making passive-aggressive comments toward me in the company of our colleagues, and generally behaving in ways that were strikingly discourteous, which I found confounding, given that we’d apparently agreed to remain friendly. I began to give up on the prospect of friendship after her no-showing a couple of events I’d invited her to without so much as a text explaining her inability to make it. The last straw was her agreeing to hangout after a departmental function then bowing out as soon as the event wrapped. She sent what seemed like a rather half-hearted “sorry” text afterwards, but I was tired of trying to keep up some semblance of an amicable connection, so I didn’t acknowledge it for some time. After a couple of weeks, I figured I was being childish, so I sent a simple “no worries,” to which no reply ever arrived (I didn’t expect one.) I just knew she had a history of being ghosted by former intimates, and I couldn’t bear inflicting that upon her, as disappointed as I was in the whole situation.

Days later, I noticed that I’d been added to a group chat by her, as she was organizing a hangout for our PhD cohort. I was surprised to be included, but was touched by the gesture, and took it as a sign that there were no hard feelings and we could be collegial in the future. Anyway, I woke the next morning to see that she’d removed me overnight, despite my not interacting with the chat in some egregious fashion (or at all). Given that this was on IG, everyone would be able to see that I’d been singled out for removal, so this felt like a particularly aggressive bid to shame me (for what I can only guess) in the eyes of our peers and ostracize me from a small, tight-knit community essential for my professional development over the next several years. I was shocked that she would do something this public and emphatic, and ever since I’ve been wondering not only why she’d do this, but how this - and whatever else she might be saying, since I’m no longer privy to communications - might affect my reputation at the university. I deactivated that account in embarrassment, but resisted the urge to block her on other platforms. I don’t know if she deleted or blocked my phone number, and I won’t be reaching out to verify. I now know I can’t assume a neutral reception, and that I didn’t know her as well as I thought, this stunt eroding much of my remaining goodwill toward her.

I’m rather demoralized, as I’ve seemingly moved in the space of a few months from having a burgeoning partnership (or, maybe, as I eventually came to view it, a dead-end, draining situationship) with someone for whom I cared deeply to having an apparent “adversary” in this very same person, someone interested in interfering with my career and social life, insofar as they intersect.

I guess what I’m looking for is, maybe, some insight into why she’d do something like this (she was never overly public about the fact that we were seeing one another, so to do something that’d presumably invite questions as to why she’d second-guess including someone whom she was frequently seen alongside strikes me as unusual), and what, if anything, I ought to do when everyone is back on campus, in the event that this is what I fear it to be (part of a smear campaign, for reasons utterly unknown to me, since I was under the impression she couldn’t care any less about me.)

For context, I have major anxiety which I take Zoloft for. It’s health anxiety / general anxiety as well as panic disorder. My mother has cardiomyopathy (idiopathic in nature), and after years of having a pacemaker she got a heart transplant. (This was years ago). I’ve been evaluated as a child and actually more recently a few months ago I was evaluated by multiple cardiologists who performed every test in the book (ekg, echo, holter monitor, blood work, etc). I have been told by all of them that it’s anxiety. I just get very worried about my heart for the obvious reasons. Every heart beat I can feel and if I feel it pound, skip a beat, or race it scares me. My psychiatrist prescribed me Zoloft and beta blockers to address this. It seemed to be a decent approach, as I felt a bit better.

When I took Qelbree for the first time I felt very weird. Mind you, I did have a cup of coffee with my breakfast and I took the medicine beforehand. After my coffee I went to study and noticed my heart was pounding and beating at a slightly elevated rate (maybe 90-100). I got very sweaty too. I noticed if I stood up fast I would get a bit dizzy. My brain also felt kind of weird like foggy/buzzy, I’m not sure how to describe the sensation. But even now this evening I feel some effects that I assume are from it because it’s XR.

1khhffa,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1khhffa/i_almost_died_today/,I almost died today,"I ride a bike to work. An e-bike I bought off the internet for 4 monthly payments of $300 because my car broke down and it would have been more than it’s worth (or I have) to fix it. I was riding my bike to work this morning for my 6:30am shift (I work at a coffee shop) and passed through a small “one lane each way” intersection with a 2 way stop on the street that runs perpendicular to the one I was riding on. Hope that makes sense. I had the right of way, no stop sign. A semi was waiting at the stop sign and I thought they saw me. I could swear I made eye contact with the driver. And as I passed through the intersection he did too, and for a split second I was looking up at a 10 foot tall grill coming at me. I swerved hard and made it, and he carried along on his route. I screeched to a halt at the other side of the intersection and looked back, on the verge of a panic attack because wtf and he just kept driving. No eye contact. Nothing. Like he never saw me at all, even when I was 3 feet away from being plastered on the front of his truck. And I went to work, opened the shop, smiled and chatted with customers like I wasn’t just almost run down. And I just keep thinking of the alternate universe where I didn’t survive. Just needed to share, thanks for reading. ",9,1746678025.0,TrueOffMyChest,2,0.92,False
1khheyd,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1khheyd/i_had_to_prove_myself_innocent_after_being/,I had to prove myself innocent after being falsely accused for sexual harassment!,"When I was a first year medical student, I used to have a regular study spot near a smoothie shop affiliated with the school that I visited daily. One day, before leaving, I asked a girl who worked there if she wanted to grab coffee sometime. At the time, I had no idea you should never try to date someone who works at a place you frequent. I must of been labeled a creep in her eyes. She hated seeing me study there or something bc of the one incident.

2 months later she ended up making up several false claims about me and told her management, who knew I was a medical student. Management then contacted my school. She alleged that I repeatedly asked for her number and offered to walk her to her car at night, none of which was true. The only time I asked for a coffee was 2 months before that. I spoke with the school’s Title IX office, and they told me to ensure something like that didn’t happen again. I said, “Okay. I will be extra careful and won't try to get anymore dates with anyone affiliated with the school."" I was allowed to go back to the smoothie shop I was not trespassed or anything, but they warned me to be careful. I never went back.

Two years later, while I was at the hospital heading to didactics (our teaching sessions outside of rotations), I walked into a room the didactic room that was still empty and thought, “Oh ,weird no one’s here yet.” Suddenly, security approached me and said I was being trespassed. I asked why, and they said they didn’t know but that I was no longer allowed on the property. They walked me to my car, and I turned in my badge.

I emailed my school, and a few hours later, they called me. They said a female student had accused me of staring at her breasts. I had no idea what was going on. I asked who had made the accusation, and they wouldn’t tell me.

I eventually appeared before a panel of doctors at my school. I told them the truth: I had no idea what this was about, and I hadn’t done anything. I suspected I was being misinterpreted because I’m slightly on the autism spectrum, but I hadn’t stared at anyone, and I didn’t even know who was accusing me or when it supposedly happened. All I did was go to the hospital and was trespassed. I walked through every interaction I had with someone on the day I was trespassed.

They brought up the previous incident, and again I told the truth. I said I didn't stare at anyone. They asked how I thought she felt and said they didn’t believe I acted with intent. They issued a six-month Title IX suspension. I was also required to undergo therapy and see a doctor to assess whether I was mentally fit to return to the program. This would of also ruined my chances of getting into a good residency.

I confided in a friend another medical student who happened to know some students at the hospital I worked at. He reached out and found out that the accuser before didactics apparently said I was staring at her breasts to about nine students and the didactic lecturer. The doctor then reported it to the hospital, and everyone moved to another room. That was when I was trespassed.

While I was getting trespassed and they were in the other room with the 9 other students my friend said the girl ended up crying in tears. She said “He doesn’t deserve this,” but also claimed to have been a prostitute before medical school. She made up additional lies about me, said I had been in front of the school board multiple times(which was not true), and even referenced the earlier incident something I had never told anyone about, which was unsettling and weird. I have no idea how she knew about it.

I appealed to the school and requested a Title IX investigation. They agreed and interviewed the other students, who apparently supported my version of events.

I eventually spoke with a Title IX investigator, who told me the incident supposedly occurred during lunch on a day different from when I had assumed and wrote up my defense about. After speaking with me, the investigator apologized for how I had been treated and said they would resolve the matter quickly.

The Title IX suspension was ultimately removed due to insufficient evidence.

The worst part? The date and time they said the incident occurred I wasn’t even at the hospital. I was at a nearby Mr. Jim’s. I also was rarely in the same room as the girl and barely spoke to her out side of how are you doing today.

This caused me to delay graduation for a year(the investigation took 3 months) and I have a gap on my resume that I have to explain. All bc of nonsense.",2,1746677982.0,offmychest,2,1.0,False
1khhexo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1khhexo,Touched up paint in three locations. One looks drastically different,"Here’s the history. Painted a room. A few months later I removed two sconces on one wall and a light on another in favor of recessed lighting

I touched up all three spots with the same sample can of paint. And also noticed a slight streak above one so I touched that up too.

Two of the spots matched great but one of the sconce spots and the streak are unbelievably lighter. Why! Color is “Swiss coffee” and it looks white 

I attached a picture of the wall, the main can of paint I used for the room (empty), and the sample

Why did this happen and what do I need to do to fix it short of repainting the entire room. ",1,1746677980.0,paint,6,0.67,False

It’s me your future friend calling from the future. You need to dm me rn so we can fulfill the prophecy (of us becoming friends) or else the world will literally blow up (oh my god!! The horror!!) 

In all seriousness I’m searching for some friends on this fine evening. I like playing guitar and writing bad songs that I post on YouTube, drinking coffee with lots of cream and sugar, and studying (fun!!!). I’m a biochem major which means I’m super intelligent and can hack into the matrix with only my mind and control whatever I want. In fact I hacked into the United States government last night just to get a live feed on vice president JD Vance’s house. And yes he does really do it with couches. 

Uhm back on topic. I love talking to people daily about wherever life takes us. Tell me about ur crappy day at work or maybe even the time you found an egg with two yolks. Or maybe we could talk about something more serious it’s up to you:) 

I try to be a happy guy I do struggle sometimes which can make me a little mopey but I always recover. If u could use some support or a friend or just somebody to yap about your affinity for rare plants and fungi with.. I’m your guy. Nerds welcome. Queer people double welcome! Let’s go!!
