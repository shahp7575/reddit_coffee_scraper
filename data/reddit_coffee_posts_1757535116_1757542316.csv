1ndrtec,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1ndrtec/giving_up_the_dream/,Giving up the dream.,"My wife and I, now in our 40s, have decided to give up the dream of owning a mobile coffee cart. It is something we have dreamed of doing for over 10 years.

Back in 2012 we watched a show called ‚Äúdangerous grounds‚Äù, that pushed our love of coffee to obsession. Trying every coffee shop and brew method we could. Then life happened.

Our daughter was born in 2012, we already had a 12 year old son, and would go on to have 2 more sons. We worked multiple jobs to survive and grow, eventually buying our first home in 2020. As both our careers grew, so did our finances.

In 2024, my wife bought a Breville and started testing the waters on a small scale. Some fold out tables, a canopy, a couple of ice chests and a bag of klatch (our favorite roaster). She did 2 pop ups, , each time profiting roughly about $500. Nothing crazy, just iced lattes and americanos, fair priced. She makes a great cup of coffee and I‚Äôm the type of person who would be painfully honest to tell her if it wasn‚Äôt as I have in the past with some experimental flavors lol. So we decided to save, and we got up to about 10k to start our cart. We‚Äôve been pricing out machines, grinders, custom carts, and then it hit us as we go through our social media.

This is the trend, mobile coffee carts. In southern California, it seems that everyone has one or is starting one. The market is already saturated, and it feels like there is no end in sight. ¬†So today we officially decided to give up. We have great lives, financially stable, great family, even grandkids. I appreciate all that God has given us, but it made me terribly sad to hear her say ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs probably best if we just don‚Äôt do it.‚Äù 

Now what do we do, the dream is over.",1,1757542193.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

Employees now grab espresso, cappuccino, or hot chocolate without leaving the building, and it has become the new spot where people chat during breaks.

**What we‚Äôve learned so far:**

* [Coffee machines with grinders](https://vmfsusa.com/product-category/coffee-vending-machines/) taste much better than pods
* Consistency matters, water temperature and cleaning schedule affect every cup
* Even in small offices, 40 to 50 cups a day is normal if the machine is good
* Cashless payment is a must since almost no one uses coins

**Challenges we faced:**

* Keeping it stocked during busy mornings
* Finding a bean blend everyone likes
* Maintenance, daily cleaning is important to keep drinks consistent

Has anyone here tried coffee vending machines for offices? Did it make a difference for your team‚Äôs morale or productivity?

I have been using a Breville Bambino plus for about a year now, but have been using pre-ground beans while sporadically researching grinders. Last week I bit the bullet and bought a Baratza ESP Pro.

The Pro has stepless grind adjustment, but the readout indicates that 1-40 are espresso settings, with settings above for pour over and drip etc.

I tried my first shot at 20 on the grinder. WAY too fine. I pulled a couple more...the last one being set at 40...it took 1 minute to run and only dribbled out a bit of very bitter esspresso at the end.

Am I doing something wrong? Shouldn't my Bambino be able to handle espresso ground at the coarsest setting from the Baratza? I am grinding Dawn Patrol Espresso Blend from Beach City Coffee. It's a dark roast.

1ndrl5h,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ndrl5h/i_tried_to_prove_an_urban_legend_was_fake_now_i/,I tried to prove an urban legend was fake. Now I deeply regret it.,"Two weeks ago I was sitting at my PC doing my work, as soon as I finished everything I could calmly relax and sit in silence with a cup of coffee.

Wandering the internet I came across an announcement about __4 missing teenagers__ in the old town district.

I got interested and decided to check information about this place on maps and the city forum on Facebook and Twitter.

After a couple of hours and 5 drunk cups of coffee I didn't find much information, only the names of the missing children and the urban legend about the cursed Darrowood Estate.

**The legend sounded something like this: In 1975,millionaire Arthur Darrowood, known for his cruelty and greed, disappeared without a trace along with his wife and two children. He built his fortune on a network of huge animal slaughter farms for meat processing plants. His wealth and influence skyrocketed after some deal made at an old Indian market. The locals are sure that he brutally scammed the traders there, and in retaliation they cursed him and his entire family.**

But there were other, more creepy rumors. In whispers on forums, people wrote that the real reason for his wealth was not the deal. They said that Arthur Darrowood worshiped something ancient and dark in the basement of his estate. That he sacrificed not only animals from his slaughterhouses, but also something more, so that this ""entity"" would grant him power.

Since then, the estate has stood abandoned. And every few years it demands a new sacrifice, luring inside those overcome by curiosity. Those who disappear seem to be erased from the city's memory, and only the most meticulous, like me, can find mentions of them.

The residents are sure that the teenagers disappeared for the same reason as the Darrowood family.

The local police brush off these answers and say that these are just urban legends and that the owner of the estate simply left the country.

After digging around on the internet some more, I looked up lists of missing people in my state, county, city, and specifically in that area. All the disappearances occurred at 7-year intervals on the fourth Saturday of the month. How many people have actually disappeared there is unknown.

Since I had no work ahead of me and had three days off, I decided to go there and find out the secret of the disappearances in this district. It could help me with my work and for writing various articles for clients.

Besides, debunking such a strong and long-standing urban legend would be an achievement for me. I packed the necessary things into a backpack and went to the car. It wasn't a long drive for me. About 1.5 hours and knowing the routes that could shorten the path I would get there even faster.

Almost reaching my destination by cutting through my shortcut, the car stalled 2km from the estate and there wasn't much gas left so I left it in place and walked on along the old country road which was clearly part of the Darrowood Estate.

After 30 minutes I was there, I saw a huge, rotten, horrifying four-story building. In front of me stood a half-meter black metal fence, on the roof of the estate there were stone sculptures resembling gargoyles, on the walls of the building there were mysterious runes. This whole atmosphere brought ideas into my head. And these ideas were only about one thing - to get away from this place and forget that it even exists.

I was too scared but I decided to at least inspect the yard.

‚Äì **Not for nothing I came here, right? I asked myself.**

A sudden, deafening screech made me flinch. Goosebumps ran down my spine, and icy sweat broke out all over my body. My heart beat so loudly that I was afraid the echo would spread throughout the entire area.

‚Äì **Phew.. Just the gate creaking I muttered aloud**

I began to study the yard. After about forty minutes, when my nerves had calmed down a bit, I didn't find anything special - just a couple of empty beer bottles and a rusty shovel lying by the fence. Deciding that all the most interesting things were hidden inside, I headed towards the door of the house.

Step by step I approached along the old, creaky porch. Every sound under my feet echoed in the silence like a shot. And now I am in front of a massive, cracked door. My hand reached for the handle...

And at that moment I tripped.

Something hard and angular lay right under the floorboard, covered with fresh leaves and a layer of light dust. I moved away and brushing away the leaves and dirt with my hand...

I saw HER

A camera, an old 2015 model, an expensive model, somewhat similar to a Sony HDR-XR550E camera. It had a worn body. That didn't make me freeze. Its strap was tightly wrapped around a broken board, as if someone had broken free and it was torn out by force.

Taking a knife out of my backpack, I cut the strap and wiped the camera, turning it on I was surprised to see a little charge. Putting the camera in my backpack, I was about to go inside the house when I saw some stains on the door and on the floor.. No-it wasn't dirt

Rusty-brown with characteristically dull brown spots and imprints of hands..

My throat went dry. This was not just a lost camera. This was evidence.

In those same seconds, my heart began to beat so fast as if it was tearing out of my chest. The pain in my temples was unbearable. Yielding to animal instinct, I without thinking started to run back, I ran very fast so fast not noticing the roots and bumps under me which were just begging to tangle and leave me longer in this terrifying place. In less than a couple of minutes I was at the car.

My hands were shaking, on the 4th try I inserted the key into the car. Every little rustle of leaves and branches made me flinch. As soon as I opened the door, I tumbled into the cabin. The click of the door closing was now the sweetest sound to me. Only here, in relative safety, did I allow myself to catch my breath.

My heart was still beating wildly, ready to jump out. I looked at my pale, frightened face in the rearview mirror, then turned to the backpack on the passenger seat.

Inside lay it. The proof. That very piece of nightmare that I had brought out of the cursed place.

I started the car and hit the gas, without turning on the headlights, as if afraid to attract someone's attention. I was leaving there. But along with me rode that chilling horror, firmly frozen to my back. And a quiet, obsessive understanding that I had touched something that was better never to touch.

Already at home, having locked all the locks, I was able to exhale with relief. I felt relatively safe.

Catching my breath, gathering all my remaining strength into a fist, I decided to take the camera out of the backpack.When I took it out it was very cold. It felt like it came straight from the snowy Alps and not from a warm backpack.

I was dying to know what was on that camera. I connected it to the pc there was only one file. The filename is just a date.That same 4th Saturday of the month. Overcoming fear,with a trembling hand, barely collecting my thoughts and calming down, I made up my mind.

I opened it.

*[00:00:01]* Camera shaking in a small van.Filmed in first person. 4 teenagers are laughing and noisily discussing something. Those same 4 missing teenagers.

*[00:01:07]* They were driving down the same road as me,in the background you can hear voices and discussions of that same urban legend, a phrase is clearly audible:

¬∑ These legends are nonsense, I don't believe it, this building is just ordinary bums and drug addicts.

*[00:01:15]* The camera is shaking badly,heavy breathing is heard. The estate comes into the camera lens. Approximate conversation in the video

**Voice 1 - Are we really going in? maybe we shouldn't..?**
 
**Voice 2- Don't be afraid, Amanda, everything will be fine.**

**Voice 3- What exactly are you worried about? I'm telling you, there are only bums there.**

**Voice 4- We will all die there! a phrase came from the teenager's lips and then only his laughter and some conversations are heard.**

The video cut off abruptly.

*[00:02:30]* screams are clearly heard the camera is shaking a teenager descended from the 3rd floor to the 2nd dropping the camera it falls it looks at the ceiling of the 4th floor from which some burgundy liquid is dripping.Down after him runs another teenager screaming.

(Hearing these voices, screams and seeing the further picture, I almost vomited, I barely restrained myself from turning off the PC and hiding in a corner in fear.)

**Voice 3 - I WAS WRONG I WAS WRONG IT'S NOT BUMS RUN LUCA RUN The video cuts off.**

*[00:03:30]* Very heavy breathing near the camera.Darkness.Running and footsteps are very clearly heard, literally after a couple of minutes screams. Very strong desperate screams of pain. The camera swayed,crying could be heard. voice 4 whispers- I knew I shouldn't have come here I knew... if you find this video never come here. Most likely my friends are dead. I'm sitting in this nook in the basement.. I'll turn on night mode.

The video shows a huge damp old basement. All the walls are in the same runes as outside the building. In the middle is a strange pentagram. Around it are bones and sticky traces. Most likely from blood. Very heavy footsteps are heard towards the camera. The video turns off.

*[00:04:10]* The camera is lying on the porch right where I picked it up.Sounds of struggle, crying and screams are heard, a horrifying laugh as if the person or creature making it had its vocal cords torn out and it was screaming these rasps through pain.The camera turns and you can see a teenager clearly no longer alive being dragged deep into the building. The door slammed shut by itself with such force that it almost broke out from the other side.

At that point I thought that was it. Fear and adrenaline were overwhelming me. I wanted to take a knife and lock myself in a bunker so that I could see from all sides what was happening. But then the camera suddenly turned on,there was one last fragment.

*[00:07:45]* You can see something in a sloppy,dirty butcher's apron stained with fresh blood, takes the camera and for a couple of seconds just looks into the camera and laughs, no face is visible, no eyes or pupils either. The most terrifying thing I saw at that moment was not its nasty laugh. But what made me break into a hot sweat and gave me goosebumps from fear. On its head it had stretched the skin from each teenager's face. A kind of mask hiding its true face. Only a couple of barely audible phrases came from its mouth, it felt like its mouth was glued or sewn shut, in a very quiet hoarse voice it said

- *Don't come to my estate. You are next*

And a very strong loud laugh. He looked into the camera right in the center. As if he was looking right into my eyes with his darkness.The video cut off at that moment. Apparently he threw the camera on the porch as bait. This was clearly not a human.

Running his words through my head, I felt an icy cold in my stomach. As if someone had stuck a fork in me and twisted it. I was scared to death but the metallic taste and adrenaline made me delete all the files from the computer without thinking. I wasn't thinking about evidence or calling the police or anything else. At that moment I just wanted to get rid of it. I took the camera, went out into the backyard of my house, I stomped on the hard drive and the camera. Then I wrapped it all in a rag soaked in gasoline and went over it well with a hammer. I took a match, lit this bundle with the remains of the camera and poured gasoline until only the body remained.

I don't know what to do now. I destroyed everything, but I feel like it changed nothing. He said you are next. This means he knows not only about me. He knows about everyone who can read this and see.

I am writing here because I had to warn you. Because I could no longer keep it to myself. If you ever hear about the Darrowood Estate- run. If you feel curiosity pulling you there - turn around and leave. This is not a joke. It is not a legend.

He is real. And he is looking for new guests, he is waiting. Every 7 years. 4th Saturday of the month.

He was looking right at me through the camera. And I know he saw my face. I hear footsteps in my house every night. My apartment smells of copper and old meat. I can't sleep. I am writing this because I am tired of enduring. I can't do anything about it anymore.

Don't look for this place. Don't repeat my mistakes. He does not forgive. Never try to debunk urban legends if you value your life. If you want a quiet life,don't mess with this. Never. **I REPEAT NEVER MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES AS I DID.**

I think I'm slowly going crazy.

P.S. If I stop responding to comments, you can be sure I have disappeared like all these people. It's all the work of **Arthur Darrowood**.",1,1757541614.0,nosleep,3,1.0,False

This time the random wheel spin brought me to menu 4. This is another of the ones I was actually kind of looking forward to, as I'm going in expecting it to basically be like Chef Boyardee (but probably a bit blander).

Interesting to find no coffee in this one, but that's fine since I wouldn't have drank it anyway. The lemonade mix was nice, as lemonade is one of my favorite cold drinks. The chocolate protein drink smelled like the strongest chocolate milk ever, but almost has a taste like mocha. Not bad, but not anything I'd go out of the way to have again. 

Sure enough, the main was basically Chef Boyardee spaghetti. Decent flavor, but I hit it with the trusty parmesan anyway. The Italian breadsticks... didn't really taste Italian to me. They almost had more of a sage sort of taste, like Thanksgiving stuffing. Not bad, and I definitely used them to clean up the bowl. But, not quite what I was expecting. 

The patriotic sugar cookies were pretty broken, but there were still quite a few solid stars, bells, flags, and eagles. Not sweet, but really good. They struck me more as butter cookies than sugar cookies, but I'd totally eat them again.

And the raisins were... raisins. The same as any little box of Sunmaid that my mom packed in my lunch in elementary school back in the 80s. So not only were they sweet and delicious, but also nostalgic. 

I didn't open the jalapeno cheese spread both because I had nothing to put it on and because I already knew it wasn't going to be up my alley after having experienced the bacon cheese spread. Definitely a little surprised that the accessory pack has matches in it. Like... you don't need them to heat the ration, so what the hell are they for?

Overall, this one is getting a 6.5/10. Would have been a 7, but the slightly off-putting taste of the chocolate protein drink lowered the score a tad. If it was just straight chocolate - it probably would have been gas.",1,1757541444.0,MRE,0,1.0,False

This will be a bit long due to everything that has happened and is still happening.

After almost four years with my old De‚ÄôLonghi Dedica EC680, I decided to upgrade to a dual-boiler machine due to its limited capabilities. I work from home, drink at least three espresso-based coffees a day (sometimes more), and, in addition to my own consumption, I make one or two drinks for my wife every day.

In March, I was planning to get a Profitec Pro 600 from another store, but I discovered the Magister Stella Dual machine with a rotary pump, E61 group head, dual boiler, and digital PID for each boiler. After watching the video on iDrinkCoffee‚Äôs YouTube channel, I decided to order it while they had a sale. I paid **$2,399.00 + tax** for the machine on March 4 and received it on March 8.

For the first couple of days, everything was perfect, the machine was very capable, and I was extremely happy with my purchase. However, less than a month into using it, I noticed a leak on the steam wand, specifically where it connects to the body. I contacted support on April 1 and was advised to open the machine and try tightening the wand from the inside. Unfortunately, there wasn‚Äôt enough space for me to do this safely. On April 4, I was sent a return label to send the machine in for service. I shipped it on April 16, and it was delivered to their service department on April 22. That‚Äôs when everything started falling apart.

A few days later, I was informed that there was damage to the body of the machine, likely caused during shipping. I should mention that I used the original box for the return and purchased an additional double-wall box and packing peanuts to place the original box inside for added protection. Despite these precautions, damage still occurred.

They ordered a replacement case and offered me two options:

* Receive the repaired machine in the meantime and send it back later to have everything transferred into the new body once it arrives.
* Leave the machine with their service team until the new case arrives, which could take over a month.

Since I work from home and drink multiple coffees a day, I opted for the first option to minimize disruption. I cannot imagine opting for the second option and waiting until early August without the machine. The machine was returned to me and delivered on Friday, May 9. After unboxing, I confirmed the visible damage with them before proceeding.

When I plugged the machine in, it immediately gave an error to fill the tank. I contacted support again, and they told me the water sensor cable might have become disconnected during transit. They provided instructions and photos to help check and reconnect it. When I opened the machine, I found that the sensor cable was not connected to anything. However, **I also discovered a broken wire** coming from one of the boilers. After a phone conversation with them, they ordered a replacement gauge capillary for me, which arrived on May 20.

If the water sensor had worked correctly and filled the boiler, the broken wire could have caused significant internal damage due to water leakage, leaving me with a 50-pound metal paperweight.

After receiving the part, I replaced the gauge capillary myself, and the machine started working again, though it still had visible damage to the body, both the steam and hot water wands, and the original leak persisted. By this point, I had been without a coffee machine for more than a month.

Later in the summer, I finally received an email from them about the replacement chassis on July 16. I had a trip scheduled for July 25, so I sent the machine back to them on July 23. They confirmed receiving it on July 25. Again, I shipped it with the extra outer box for added protection.

On August 1, I received an update that they had started working on my machine, but the technician would be going on vacation the next week and would return on August 11 to continue. That was fine, everyone needs a vacation, although I thought another tech could have continued the work. I also told them I would be travelling from August 15 to September 8, and no one would be available to receive deliveries during that time. I asked if they could send it back before I left, or else hold onto it and ship it out on September 5.

On August 14, they told me that the new chassis didn‚Äôt come with the boiler support bracket, so they were waiting for a special tool to transfer it from the old chassis. Then on August 15, I received another message that the chassis replacement was complete and they were doing final tests to make sure everything was working properly, with no leaks or other issues. If all went well, they would have the machine boxed up and shipped by the end of the day.

While I was on vacation, I sent them a reminder on September 4 to send the machine on September 5. Thankfully, they held it for me and shipped it after I returned.

I finally received my machine yesterday. After unboxing, I immediately noticed:

* The replacement chassis is bent
* Black silicone was applied in a way that looks very messy and ugly
* The front legs don‚Äôt sit flat (they only touch at the sides)
* There are several huge scratches on the replaced part

And on top of all that, the original issue, the steam wand leak, still exists. This was the whole reason I sent the machine in the first place.

Btw, after receiving the machine with a broken gauge capillary earlier, I sent them a detailed message explaining every step and asking why they didn‚Äôt just replace the machine instead of this constant back-and-forth. The summary of my email was: this is not sustainable. Sending a 50-pound box multiple times, not fixing it properly, mailing a single gauge across the country, and wasting my time and energy, how is that sustainable?

It‚Äôs now been six months since I purchased this machine, and I‚Äôve been without it for nearly two months involuntarily and another 21 days voluntarily (when I asked them to hold it during my vacation). Despite this minimal usage, the machine now looks beaten up, and the original problem hasn‚Äôt been fixed.

I‚Äôm feeling extremely tired and discouraged by how things have turned out. I‚Äôve been patient, kind, and calm throughout this process, but every attempt at resolution has just been a waste of time. I‚Äôm also exhausted from repeatedly packing the machine, hauling it to UPS, and hoping it comes back in proper condition.

Last night, I asked them for either a brand-new replacement or a full refund, even though I‚Äôd rather not get another machine from them at this point. I just want to end this business relationship and move on. While I understand that shipping damage can happen, after all this time and effort, I cannot accept the machine in this state. I haven‚Äôt heard back yet, and I‚Äôm left with a damaged, leaking machine. They'll probably get back to me in a couple of days.

They‚Äôre fast at shipping orders when you buy something, but I have zero confidence in their support beyond the point of sale. They don‚Äôt feel like a customer-focused company, just another profit-focused one.

I‚Äôm sharing this because I haven‚Äôt seen many negative experiences posted about them before, but this has been mine so far. I‚Äôll keep this thread updated. My next step is either getting a brand-new replacement (reluctantly) or a full refund. If they refuse to acknowledge what‚Äôs happened over these past six months, I‚Äôll proceed with small claims court in BC. I‚Äôve documented everything, including all conversations, pictures, and videos.

**Short Description:**

**Don and Kit, two troubled teens working as clerks at a failing pawn shop in rural Georgia, make a living off side hustles. After burning down a house for $1,000, stealing a cherry-red ‚Äô71 Chevelle, and roughing up a loan shark‚Äôs debtor, they get sucked into a darker deal: a $5,000 hit-job on the poster‚Äôs ex-wife. The plan? Kill her, stage it as a robbery, and frame her new boyfriend. But things go sideways fast. A misfire, a bloody massacre, and a trail of bodies turn their simple heist into a full-blown nightmare. Now on the run, Don and Kit hop freight trains, crash nightclubs, steal cars, and try to stay one step ahead of the law. Loyalty, desperation, and loss pull them deeper into chaos, but their bond may be the only thing left that can keep them alive. The road ahead is a blur, but it's only a matter of time before the past catches up with them.**

**---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

**FULL PLOT OUTLINE:**

**Origins**

Donovan Larrick, sixteen, lost his father overseas before he could walk. Kit Ketrey, seventeen, lost his mother to a heroin overdose. They work the counter at a failing pawn shop in small-town Georgia, keeping the lights on with side hustles: fake jewelry, skimmed cash, and unregistered pistols.

Donovan spends his nights on Luna‚Äôs porch. She's his girlfriend, first love and the center of his world trapped in an abusive home. He is saving every dollar he can to get her out and move out of town with her.

Don and Kit are glued together like brothers. They work dead-end shifts at the pawn shop, scamming where they can, and killing long nights with cigarettes, old kung fu movies, and each other‚Äôs company.

**Segment I: Easy Money**

One night in the pawn shop‚Äôs back office, Kit stumbles on a job post that feels both stupid and serious: $1,000 cash to torch a suburban home. The request is posted under a throwaway handle by a man named Clay Holloway.

Clay‚Äôs father, Walter Holloway, had been a local real estate baron‚Äîowned half the strip malls in the county. When Walter died, his will divided everything between Clay‚Äôs two older sisters and his younger brother. Clay got nothing. ‚ÄúIncompetent, unfit to manage finances,‚Äù it reads. Clay fought it in court. The siblings lawyered up. After six months of bitter probate hearings, Clay was slapped with legal fees he couldn‚Äôt pay and barred from appealing again. His sisters sold off Walter‚Äôs boat and vacation property, cashed in a hefty life insurance policy, and put the suburban house--the family‚Äôs original home--on the market.

Donovan leans over Kit‚Äôs shoulder, reading every line. ‚ÄúA grand for one night‚Äôs work. That‚Äôs more than we‚Äôll make in a month here.‚Äù

They reach out to the poster, Clay Holloway, and strike a deal: one thousand dollars in cash for burning the house to the ground, and payment after the job is finished, They decide on a date for tomorrow night, around 3-4AM.

3:00 A.M.

The sedan creeps down the street, headlights off. They cut the engine and let it die. The car ticks as it cools, metal settling into silence.

Donovan steps out first. Baggy black cargos stuffed into boots, suspenders hanging over a plain shirt. A rifle slung across his back, heavy. Beretta M9 on his hip, flashlight fixed under the barrel. Military posture in a quiet suburb.

Kit slips out the passenger side, wearing all black.

He looks like the dark itself. He opens the trunk, hauls out the duffel, the zipper rattling like a warning. Gas cans, chemicals, oily rags, a handful of firecrackers.

The house waits at the end of the driveway. Dark. Hollow. For Sale sign tilted in the grass, sun-bleached No Trespassing nailed to the fence. The kind of place that feels emptied of air.

They cut across the ditch, boots crunching leaves. Kit notices the breaker box. It has a pad-lock.

The carport stretches along the cement drive. They notice the sliding glass door that leads into the living room. Locked.

Donovan pulls the Beretta. Clicks the light on. Pops one round. Glass shatters, raining over the concrete in sharp little teeth.

They step inside. Careful steps over broken glass. Flashlights sweeping, guns drawn.

The house smells stale, like carpet and dust. Big mirrors reflect their beams back at them. Wide rooms. Vaulted ceilings. Built in the 80s, still carrying that weird family comfort.

Their flash lights cutting through the darkness.

Kit kneels, drops the duffel. Starts pulling gear. Gas cans. Matches. Firecrackers. He lines them up like tools on a workbench.

Don shines his light down the hallway. Checks each corner. Empty. Just beige walls, carpet, old wallpaper peeling in the dining room. The house has been stripped, but the bones are still here.

Kit twists a gas can open, the fumes spilling out sharp.

They pour, gasoline soaking deep into the carpet, dark stains spreading. Kit shoves firecrackers in the corner, sticks a rag like a fuse.

Don glances at a cracked wall mirror. His flashlight catches his reflection.

The house breathes gasoline.

Kit lights a test fuse. Smoke curls up. His voice is low. ‚ÄúOne thousand bucks feels cheap for something this big.‚Äù

The fire begins to spread, and Don and Kit run out.

**Segment II: The Repo Job.**

After torching the house, Don and Kit get tipped off to another job on the forum. This one‚Äôs from a man who just lost everything in a bitter divorce. His ex-wife kept the car he loved, a cherry-red ‚Äô71 Chevelle, and then bragged about her new boyfriend driving it around town. For $800, He wants it gone. No questions asked.

The boys take him up on his offer.

3:15AM.

The street‚Äôs quiet. No cars, no lights on, just the two of them pulling up to the driveway. Don cuts the engine and kills the headlights. The car ticks as it cools.

Kit crouches behind some bushes near the garage. Don is right behind him, rifle on his back, Beretta at his side. They move slow, careful, knowing every sound carries.

The garage has a simple padlock. Kit pulls out a set of picks from his pocket and starts working it. A couple of clicks, some pressure, and the lock pops. He motions Don over. No words. Just a nod.

Inside, the garage smells like oil, dust, and old tires. The ‚Äô71 Chevelle sits tight against the shelves, the paint dull in the weak light from a single bulb overhead. Kit moves along the side, checking corners, workbenches, and boxes. Don crouches behind the car, flashlight sweeping rims, tires, windows.

‚ÄúKeys?‚Äù Don asks, voice low.

Kit slides the center console open, grabs a small envelope with the registration, and tucks it into his jacket. ‚ÄúAll clear.""

They slide the Chevelle out carefully, inch by inch, along the driveway so the engine won‚Äôt start inside the garage and wake anyone up. Kit kneels beside the ignition, signaling Don.

‚ÄúStay inside. Keep an eye on the house. Any movement, any sound, you signal me.‚Äù

Don nods, moves back into the garage and gently opens the door that leads inside. He steps quietly, boots whispering over the wood floors. The house is normal‚Äîfurniture, TV, books, nothing flashy. No alarms, no surprises.

He notices a slice of bread on the counter. Shrugs. Pops it in the toaster.

Cut to Kit outside, crouched at the wheel, patiently trying the ignition without revving it. Sparks, clicks, nothing.

Cut back to Don, nibbling toast, chewing slow, alert. Silence except for the faint ticking of the toaster and the subtle sound of his boots on the floor.

Curiosity wins. He creeps upstairs on tiptoe, scanning the hallway, hands brushing the railing.

Then a sound. From the bedroom.

A low, unmistakable moan. Female. Followed by rhythmic pounding.

Don freezes, grimaces, disgusted, then carefully retreats down the stairs as quietly as he can. Boots soft on the wood, body tense.

Outside, he meets Kit, who hasn‚Äôt moved a muscle.

Kit finally gets the ignition to catch. The engine hums low, no revving, no sudden noise. Don slides behind the wheel, shifting smoothly. Kit rides shotgun, scanning the backroads, eyes sharp.

They take the Chevelle off the driveway, careful not to hit gravel or make a sound, hugging the shadows. The night smells of mud and wet leaves.

Minutes later, they reach a remote swamp, thick with reeds and soft mud, a place nobody would ever think to check. Don guides the car slowly, inch by inch, until the tires sink, then the hubcaps, then the body, swallowing it whole. Water and mud cover the chrome. The Chevelle is gone, lost to the black swamp.

They climb out, boots muddy, chest heaving from adrenaline, but grinning. Don lights a cigarette.

‚ÄúClean,‚Äù he says.

Kit wipes his hands on his cargos, smirking. ‚ÄúToo easy.‚Äù

**Segment III: The Warning**

The fourth forum job isn‚Äôt fire or theft like the last -- it‚Äôs intimidation. Denny Rogers, a greasy loan shark who runs his racket out of a billiards hall, posts the job. Randall Corbin owes him a pile, and Denny wants the reminder delivered loud enough that Randall pisses himself but quiet enough the cops don‚Äôt get wind.

Don and Kit take it. They track Randall to a neon-soaked nightclub, bass rattling the walls. The crowd is a mess of perfume, sweat, and cheap vodka.

They push through until Kit spots Randall and some random woman slipping into the bathroom. Don pounds on the last stall door.

RANDALL (muffled, grunting): ‚ÄúOccupied, asshole!‚Äù

Don slams his boot through the lock. The door flies open, revealing Randall, shirt untucked, pants tangled at his knees, a girl crouched in front of him on the filthy tile. Her lipstick is smeared, her eyes wide. Randall curses, trying to cover himself.

Don intimidates him and tells him the clock is ticking.

After leaving Randall trembling in the bathroom stall, Don and Kit head to the bar inside the club. The bass rattles their chests, neon lights reflecting off spilled drinks. They slide onto bar stools, order beers with their fake IDs, and let themselves relax a little. Kit sips cautiously, scanning the crowd for trouble. Don downs half his beer in one gulp, laughing, shaking his head at the absurdity of what just happened.

Finally, they leave through the main entrance, stepping out into the empty streets. The chilly night air hits them.

Don notices a young, buxom woman being sexually harassed by an older, sleazy man. He steps in gently at first, politely telling the man to back off. When the man pushes and mocks him, Don‚Äôs soft-hearted patience snaps -- he beats the guy mercilessly, leaving him bleeding and humiliated. The woman escapes safely, and Kit smirks at Don‚Äôs brutal efficiency. The encounter shows Don‚Äôs moral code: he‚Äôs compassionate but will not tolerate injustice, even on the streets.

Don strolls into the diner late at night, the neon sign flickering outside painting the empty booths in pink and blue. Luna‚Äôs behind the counter, effortlessly juggling orders, and he can‚Äôt resist tossing her a sarcastic joke. She fires back, sharp and playful, and just like that, the night hums with easy laughter. He lingers, helping her refill coffee, swapping stories with regulars, leaning on the counter, and Don eats a killer omelette, and for a few hours, the weight of their pasts feels a little lighter.

**Segment IV: The Collective**

Don and Kit respond to a forum post offering $3,000 for protection. The client is Eve, an 18-year-old goth girl working for a local syndicate, The Collective. She is transporting sensitive items, money, or documents, and the syndicate fears she might be intercepted by police or rival gangs. Don and Kit are hired as low-level muscle, tasked with standing watch and keeping her safe during a high-risk night.

Eve presents herself as aloof and dangerously playful.¬†

She leads the boys through the neon-soaked streets and into tense situations that escalate rapidly, including minor confrontations, suspicious drivers, and moments where the threat of law enforcement feels immediate. Don and Kit take the job seriously, anticipating danger, unaware that Eve has her own agenda.

Once Eve completes her task and Don and Kit‚Äôs protection ensures nothing goes wrong, they climb back into the car, adrenaline still high. Suddenly, Eve draws a gun and presses it to Don‚Äôs head. She demands $3,500 and the car, forcing them to drive up a lone dirt road nearby. Once there, she makes them drop their weapons and gear. Kit dashes out of the car to the side. Eve fires but misses as Kit ducks behind the car.

Eve‚Äôs attention is on Kit as she advances. Don lunges, grabbing her from behind and holding her still. Kit returns with a large glass bottle from the back seat, smashing it against her in a frantic, cinematic flurry. Eve goes down hard, bleeding, dead.

Panicked but methodical, Don and Kit immediately begin planning how to deal with the situation, cracking jokes and bickering as they work, the dark humor of the absurd moment cutting through the tension.

Don and Kit decide to remove all of Eve‚Äôs clothes, convinced it will erase all trace evidence. Blood and bodily fluids are obvious evidence. Fibers and hair can betray the scene. They peel off jackets and pants, shake out coats, and wipe down the car, imagining every stray hair linking them to the crime. Shoes and dirt transfer is a factor; they scrub mud off the tarp and rocks, thinking detectives will trace footprints. Gloves and handling are carefully managed; by stripping and handling her with care, they minimize fingerprints and skin cells, as if they‚Äôve memorized every procedural ever written.

With Eve restrained and the immediate threat neutralized, they drive around town in a mix of panic and grim amusement, meticulously plotting their next moves while laughing at their own ridiculous luck and incompetence. The scene emphasizes both their resourcefulness and the darkly comic absurdity of spiraling out-of-control criminal situations.

Don and Kit wade into the Georgia bayou, water up to their thighs, Don‚Äôs headlamp cutting through the darkness. They carry Eve‚Äôs body wrapped in a tarp, wedging her behind thick reeds and cypress roots. Piling moss and mud on top to disguise and weigh down the tarp, they ensure it will sink, not a proud moment of the boys, but it needs to be done.

By the time they drag themselves out, their clothes are ruined, coated in mud and swamp water. Half-panicked, half-amused, they toss the soaked garments aside and wipe down the tarp and their boots, leaving the bayou eerily silent.

**Segment V: The Contract**

Kit spends hours in the pawn shop‚Äôs back office, scrolling shady forums. He finds a post by Nico Riggs offering five thousand dollars to kill Vicki Ramirez, Nico Riggs wants his ex-wife dead to collect a life insurance payout and recoup losses from recent divorce settlements and court costs. The post is sloppy, bitter, and chillingly real.

The terms are simple. A small amount of crypto sits in escrow. The rest releases only after proof of death. The client wants Vicki‚Äôs phone and a photo of a playing card laid on her body.

Kit is hesitant at first. Donovan sees five thousand dollars and a way to rescue Luna. Vicki had a life insurance policy. Nico believes her death is the only way to recover the money she took in the divorce.

The Plan

They stage it as a burglary. They steal a car, wear gloves, take a .38 revolver for noise control, and a 9mm as backup. Tuesday night is chosen because Vicki usually returns from the salon late.

The plan is to cut power to lights and cameras, take the phone, drop the card, and leave without being seen.

What Goes Wrong

Vicki is not alone. Her boyfriend has two friends over watching a game.

The doorbell camera still works on battery and records their faces in partial profile. A fragment of the stolen car‚Äôs plate is captured. A neighbor hears a struggle and calls 911. Patrol cars arrive early.

Inside, the boyfriend rushes Donovan. The .38 misfires on a bad round. Donovan switches to the 9mm. Kit is tackled. A second shot ricochets and kills one of the friends.

Vicki grabs a knife and slashes Donovan‚Äôs arm. Kit shoots her. Donovan places the playing card on her body and takes her phone to satisfy the forum‚Äôs proof requirements.

They flee but drop a glove in the yard. DNA is left behind. The doorbell camera has recorded everything.

Vicki is dead, but the scene is far from clean. Three additional deaths occur. The news calls it a massacre. The forum freezes the escrow. Nico deletes his account. There is no payout, only a manhunt.

Escape

Traffic cameras and the doorbell footage catch the stolen Civic. Gas-station footage shows Donovan buying gauze and hydrogen peroxide twenty minutes after the murders.

The 9mm casings match ammo Kit recently resold from the pawn shop. Detectives begin canvassing the strip mall. Witnesses recognize Donovan and Kit.

If they stay, they will be caught. They take cash from the pawn shop, ditch the Civic, and hop a freight train heading west.

The Road

They travel through Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana, changing cars often. They lift wallets at truck stops. They sleep wherever they can, hitchhike, crash nightclubs and bars frequently, steal cars, hop freight trains, and avoid law enforcement at every turn, they first hop a freight town to escape and ditch their car.

Hitchhiking

Donovan and Kit leap from a slow-moving freight train onto a gravel shoulder. Their legs burn, arms are scraped, and hearts hammer.

A beat-up Honda pulls over. Morgan leans out the window. She sees the cuts and fear but does not ask questions. She lets them in.

Inside the car, they whisper jokes and share a smoke, trying to calm down. For a moment, the world feels normal. By dawn, Morgan drops them at a roadside motel. She leaves a map marked with backroads and a small trace of human kindness before disappearing.

Billy

On the streets next to a casino, Billy Tran is running with a duffel bag. He has ripped a rigged dice game and owes dangerous people.

Donovan and Kit corner him, expecting an easy score. Billy offers the car, cash, and himself. By midnight, the three of them are driving down empty streets, reckless but feeling free.

Town-to-Town

By the time they reach Lafayette, fear and tension weigh heavily on them. They juggle fake IDs, crowded clubs, and the constant fear of recognition.

‚ÄúWhat is Love‚Äù blares on a club speaker, a cruel reminder of the carefree life they no longer have. A stripper‚Äôs keys provide the next getaway. News updates flash on phones and TVs: four dead in Georgia, two juveniles wanted, police warn they are armed and dangerous.

Who is on Their Trail

Eldrick Birch, a private investigator hired by Vicki‚Äôs sister, tracks the boys through eyewitness reports, gas-station surveillance, and pawn shop records. He shadows their movements quietly, piecing together their trail from what people say and what they leave behind.

Loris Delmar, a bounty hunter, is after Billy for skipping bond on the casino scam. Loris does not care about the murders, only bringing Billy in.

Local and state police coordinate once the doorbell footage circulates. The manhunt intensifies. The case is no longer a whodunit. It is a dragnet.

Themes

The story explores love, loyalty, and loss. It shows teens forced into crime by circumstance and desperation. Consequences are immediate, brutal, and often unfair.

1ndr9yj,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDPartners/comments/1ndr9yj/i_had_a_chance_meeting_with_my_expartners_fp_from/,I had a chance meeting with my ex-partner‚Äôs FP from 2 years ago‚Ä¶ we get along so well.,"So I (F31) got out of a 7 month relationship with a pwBPD (F29) about 2 months ago. Let‚Äôs call her Lina. As the story goes, it started as a whirlwind romance quickly followed by the most tumultuous rollercoaster ride I have ever experienced. The relationship finally ended when I refused to give in to her perceptions of me during an episode. I was really struggling emotionally in the aftermath, but Ive thankfully had consistent access to therapy, have very supportive friends, and have made a commitment to understanding the caretaking tendencies and schemas that had me holding on to a relationship that was terrible for me.

Recently, I took to Bumble BFF to make more connections. Not long after, I matched with someone (28F) who shared my name on the app (the short form of both our names). I will call her Mo. The name coincidence was the first thing she remarked on when she messaged me. Aside from the name, we also had so many more things in common between our interests and hobbies. Eventually, I suggested we meet up. It turned out that we even live within walking distance of each other. 

Just before meeting, we added each other on social media and I noticed that one of the few mutuals she was following was Lina‚Äôs closest friend. When we finally met at a neighborhood cafe, we connected dots in relation to this mutual friend and learned that we also had traumatic experiences with Lina in common... 

It turns out that Lina met Mo on a dating app in 2023. Mo insisted that they remain friends since their relationship desires did not align. As friends, they spent a lot of time together. However, over time, Lina would consistently try to push Mo‚Äôs boundaries. Whether that was pushing for physical intimacy, needing to call her everyday, or inviting herself to family events. As is also typical, Lina was emotionally volatile and Mo felt she was walking on eggshells. Maybe about a year in, Mo reached her boiling point and cut ties. It even caused a riff within Mo‚Äôs friend and family bubble, as Lina formed relationships with the people closest to Mo. 

We sat in this coffee shop for 4 hours hearing and validating each other‚Äôs stories. It was finally after this chance encounter that any lingering feelings of guilt and doubt surrounding the emotional abuse I endured were wiped away. 

Mo, Lina and I enjoy the same music and have engaged a lot in a local scene. Mo expressed that since detaching from Lina over a year and a half ago, she has felt fear around re-entering the same spaces as Lina. I have felt the same hesitation for the past couple months. We are both aware of attempts Lina has made to speak ill of us to other people within the scene. I suggested to Mo that we take our power back and not let Lina get in the way of us being able to engage with things we enjoy. We have arranged to go to an event this weekend that I am 80% sure Lina will also attend.

When we were together, Lina told me bits and pieces of her relationship with Mo and seemed to feel hurt and confused about why she was abruptly cut out of her life. Now I have a fuller picture and know Lina‚Äôs role in it all.

I‚Äôm not sure what will happen if Lina sees us together at this event. Me and Mo don‚Äôt have a lot of social overlap so Lina would have no idea how we came to know each other. Would she rage? Would she keep to herself and spiral quietly? Me and Mo will definitely have to prepare for the chance of the former. 

Part of me feels concern about what the sight of us might illicit in Lina. But I‚Äôm done with caretaking her feelings‚Ä¶",2,1757540818.0,BPDPartners,0,1.0,False

I realized that despite shopping and enjoying that downtown for 10+ years I had no idea what kind of church it was. I‚Äôm a curious person so I pulled up my maps to just see what kind it was. I was shocked to see that there was actually a whole cluster of churches on that street(5 or 6). I only noticed one whenever I drove by. 

With my curiosity peaked and desperate for any excuse to stop studying, I decided to take a little stroll and check them out.

I wanted to reach out and see what you wish was cheaper or higher quality (for non-wild/cultivated mushrooms - ie not truffles and morels). Frankly, in a general sense I tend to think most gourmet mushrooms are highly overrated. They're extremely expensive and most of them taste worse than a portobello or shiitake, which are cheap, delicious and hard to compete on. I'm in the process of restarting a mushroom business, previously I was growing a wide variety for farmers market types (the usual blend), doing mostly retail sales with a few wholesale customers (mostly other farms that would include them in their CSA package) but this time around would rather focus on using my available space for fewer varieties, focusing more on volume and B2B sales.

The only real exception of the bunch IMO is the king oyster. The whole thing is edible (better value than other oysters), it looks great when plated as scallops or sliced down the middle as a steak, has a good shelf life, doesn't break apart when handling so much and a lot of smaller farms struggle with them while I excelled. My intent is to limit my fresh produce offering to king oysters only going forward, but I wanted to reach out to this community and see what you want or struggle to find at a good price/quality first - I simply want to fill any demand with supply and work backwards from there. 

\*\*We're actually pivoting to focus on mushroom coffee only (cordyceps, lions mane, reishi, etc) but I will miss doing fresh produce sales. So I'd like to keep at least one fresh produce product offering. It's fun keeping in touch with so many business owners. ",1,1757540235.0,Chefit,3,0.67,False

The ex-producers were either petty and exaggerating at best or outright lying at worst.,"I feel like this needs to be addressed before the Sards make the episode covering the three films and say something like ""the movies were made by controversial Channel Awesome company"".

  
Disclaimer: I am not a die hard Nostalgia Critic fanboy, nor am I defending Channel Awesome. I feel that criticisms of the Channel Awesome videos and Nostalgia Critic as a character are valid. I certainly don't have any love for that terrible review of Pink Floyd's The Wall. I just think that if something is going to be applied to fair and analytical criticism, then honesty should matter above all else.

  
If you are curious for criticisms of the document, I would highly recommend that you check out videos by a guy named Nettles (https://www.youtube.com/@nettles5517). He does an excellent rundown of all of them, going over legality, how common these practises are in workplaces and filmmaking industry, and just how these people were whining about nothing. (No I am not Nettles.) He has not covered the Justin Carmical controversy or the stuff with Holly Brown yet, but that is his next video as of the time of this post.

  
A Rushed Rundown of the most bullshit ones:



There was water on the anniversary movies. Doug, Rob and co. did pay for some food, as well as their travel and accomodation. Anybody who sees the Behind the Scenes videos on the movies can confirm this. Lindsay Ellis said in one of those BtS videos that she wanted coffee... when they were filming in the Nevada desert, even when they were advising they drink water. They were also upset that they had to pay for their own meals.

  
They never signed contracts, but they still chose to be on the website and do the movies without pay anyway. They appeared in three anniversary films of their own volition. Some of them, like Linkara and Blockbuster Buster, even used footage or made reference to the anniversary movies in their videos. So did they hate making them or not?

  
The actress fainting after being tied up was a lie. The lady in question, Elisa Hansen, was even upset that details were made up about her without her ever being consulted.

  
A woman claimed she was groomed because she may have been 18 years old, but she had the mind of a 16 year old. What?

  
There was no evidence of $90,000 being stolen from the people who invested in the Indiegogo campaign. In fact, an investigation would find that they did everything they said they would with the money. They were just bad at budgeting and planning when it came to making the promised shows. That's not malice, that's incompetence.

  
Holly Brown seemed to be complaining about Doug and Rob trying to save her life because they were armed with a baseball bat and a sword. They were concerned a guy was going to come after her and she HAD to detail that in a very critical document?

  
Allison Pregler's complaints were very petty and one-sided. She said that Mike Michaud cornered her to criticise her. When from the way she describes it, he could have just as easily been giving her hard but constructive criticism. She also says that he hated women, when men are complaining in this very document about grievances they had with him, was he sexist or not?

  
Also, Allison admits to not posting videos out of spite. Did she want to get kicked off? This reason and others (like not responding to Skype messages or agreeing to meetings, as is evidenced in the chat logs provided) were why she was kicked off.

  
Some other producers are jealous that a site has rules and that they are enforced. Like, having to post a minimum of two videos a month and failure to meet this without consulting higher ups will result in removal.

  
The producers hated working on the site, but also they were shocked that the Nostalgia Critic, the face of the website, was going to die in To Boldly Flee and that they were not told ahead of time. They seemed worried that the website would become worthless and their viewership would go down if he were to stop. I.e. they admit to leeching off of his fame and not wanting Doug to go down his own path when he doesn't want to be Nostalgia Critic anymore. Yes, maybe your income would be affected, but maybe that's a sign you weren't cut out to be video reviewers in the first place?

  
Speaking of Doug being the face of Channel Awesome / ThatGuyWithTheGlasses, some of them complain about Doug being the face of Channel Awesome / ThatGuyWithTheGlasses. Well, yes, Nostalgia Critic is the name is that draws the most clicks out of all of you. He is one of the founders of the site. It's called ThatGuyWithTheGlasses for a reason.

  
They are even as petty as to complain that Doug didn't watch his videos, wasn't knowledgeable of anime and didn't want them to deliver lines in a way that he, the director, didn't like on his movies. Surely, you can see this all as a little self-centred?



There are many other issues I have with it as well.  


There might be something I am missing, but surely grievances as petty as these would get dismissed in any courtroom? Why are these included along with allegations of rape and grooming, when the rape and grooming could just stand on their own? It's just to pad a document out, isn't it?

  
As for the Justin Carmical stuff, I don't know alot about the guy, but if I wanted to form an opinion of him, I would probably use material that's not based on what this document has to say about him (though he is never referred by name in it, these were all deductions that the Internet made after the fact).

Two days ago, I went to a coffee shop after school with my best friends to treat ourselves for various achievements together. This coffee shop is right in front of my school, and it has a wall made of glass, so everything is exposed for people drinking to see. I was taking a sip of my coffee when I saw my brother and my ex walking and laughing together. I almost choked on my drink. I asked my friends if that was really my brother and my ex together, and they confirmed it.

This bothered me for various reasons:

1. IT'S MY EX AND MY BROTHER TOGETHER.
2. My brother and I have a two-year age gap, and my ex and I had a one-and-a-half-year age gap. This might be more acceptable if we were older, but I'm 15, so you can do the math and see how wrong this is for me.
3. My ex and I did not end on good terms; in fact, we ended on bad terms, and he tends to manipulate people.
4. My ex doesn‚Äôt have any friends his own age; they are all younger than him, which is a serious red flag in my opinion.

I decided to call my brother right away to see if he would lie to me or be honest. He lied. I asked him where he was and if he was with anyone, and he said he was walking home by himself. This annoyed me, so when I got home, I confronted him. He said it wasn't that big of a deal and that I was overreacting, which my parents also agreed with when I asked my brother to stop hanging out with him.

For extra background information, my brother and I have a good relationship; we're close. My brother met my ex after we broke up, and they were not friends previously. My ex tends to lie about how we broke up, and of course, he did it with my brother, which momentarily made my brother believe him. Thankfully, I knocked some sense into him, and he believed me in the end.

(EDIT: I'm a girl, and my ex is a guy. Sorry I didn't make it clearer, lol.)

When we were together, Lina told me bits and pieces of her relationship with Mo and seemed to feel hurt and confused about why she was abruptly cut out of her life. Now I have a fuller picture and Lina‚Äôs role in it all.

I‚Äôm not sure what will happen if Lina sees us together at this event. Me and Mo don‚Äôt have a lot of social overlap so Lina would have no idea how we came to know each other. Would she rage? Would she keep to herself and spiral quietly? Me and Mo will definitely have to prepare for the chance of the former. 

Part of me feels concern about what the sight of us might illicit in Lina. But I‚Äôm done with caretaking her feelings‚Ä¶",1,1757539652.0,BPD,1,0.67,False

It‚Äôs been three weeks since you let go, and I remember calling you because that‚Äôs my first reaction to anything. And yes, I stalk. Sometimes I look at everything around me and think of you. But the more I see it, the more grateful I am that I let you leave, because I know you were tired of being disrespected and tired of being the last resort. I promise I‚Äôm aware of my actions. I know what I did was wrong, and nonetheless, I did them.

There‚Äôs no apology or anything I can say to undo or fix what we had. Sometimes I imagine saying so much to you, but it all comes from a hurt place. I try to tell myself what I did was justified, but it‚Äôs not‚Äîand it will never be justifiable. Should I give myself some slack? Maybe. But either way, when I close my eyes, I think of the scar under your chin, the scars on your hand from when you were a kid, the calm and smoothness of your voice. Even your name is beautiful, just like your brown eyes and coconut-scented skin.

When I say all of this, I know a part of me wants to fly to Georgia and find you, but I also know I‚Äôll sleep a little better seeing you treated right‚Äîto get ‚Äújust because‚Äù flowers, to be a princess passenger, to play your favorite R&B songs, and to see you do your little grind dance, the one I love so much. Wow. I‚Äôm tearing up just writing this. I was always so good at this.

For so long, I based my life around you, and maybe that was my error‚Äîbasing my life on women instead of myself. This is my story, and you‚Äôre just a chapter, but you will always be my favorite chapter. You‚Äôll forever be my morning coffee, and like your TikTok says, I will never forget you.

My father came back with this baby pink bag with inside the gift: a barbie pink trousse with a heart print. It's not even expensive it honestly looks really cheap.

Now, i don't mean to sound ungrateful, but i was baffled to say the least. There wasn't even a receipt to exchange it, and i have really no use for this bag. I would have been much happier with the 10 dollars he probably spent on it and would have gotten a burger or sum. And also i refuse to believe this was something i could have liked or even used. So when my parents told me to call him and thank him, i didn't under the guise of bad memory.

I thought after hearing about my diagnosis, my family would back off a little with the horse stuff. Nope. My ‚Äúwife‚Äù would call me names and guilt me into helping out. I tried echoing that my physical therapist said not to lift anything over 15 lbs until she thought I was ready. Wife just called me a b-word or a$$hole, whichever rolled off her tongue easier. I ended up going against the PT‚Äôs recommendations and just slapped a back brace on and did shit anyways. Ended up not being able to walk or fully extend my back again a week later, and my left leg started going numb. She eventually apologized after adding the p-word to that list of names, and my Dr telling us I‚Äôd need surgery if I kept up what I was doing. I thought for sure at that point my wife finally understood to f*k off about the damn horses. Nope. It didn‚Äôt even take three days. Started asking me to do stuff again. Then one night her mom called me a ‚Äúsorry ass husband‚Äù because I wouldn‚Äôt move some bags of grain. That was the final straw for me. I rarely came out of my room after that. Spent sun up to sun down either working on my novel or trying to learn programming, just something that would allow me to change careers. Bc there‚Äôs no way I could do my ACTUAL day job with this injury. Yeah, this meant I didn‚Äôt see our son as much. Yeah, my wife obviously started complaining that she was unhappy in our marriage. Did I gaf tho? No, not really. Truth be told I wanted out of the marriage at that point, but didn‚Äôt know how. Thoughts of getting out of the marriage by suicide started creeping in. Yes, I am still seeing a therapist for that last part. But either way, the day finally came when I was getting fussed at about not leaving the room, and I finally let it rip. Mind you, I use vulgar language on here, but I did still love my wife. So letting it rip consisted of me pointing out calmly why I was upset, and informing her I was unhappy in the marriage. That‚Äôs when she said it. ‚ÄúDivorce.‚Äù The thought was already in my head, but hearing HER say it tore me to pieces. I begged, begged, and begged for her to stay like an idiot. Told her I would do anything she wanted & that everything was my fault. She agreed to stay with me, but this was the last chance I get. Sooooo‚Ä¶ yeah. I sucked up my pain during PT. Said I suddenly feel fine. My PT gave me a side eye about it but eventually cleared me. Doctor didn‚Äôt believe me either, especially when I asked for a refill of muscle relaxers ‚Äújust in case.‚Äù I ate them things like candy. Started my mornings with a cup of coffee and a handful of ibuprofen. On bad days I‚Äôd pop a leftover oxycodone I had from all the times I‚Äôve had kidney stones. Sometimes I‚Äôd find myself just gnawing on my thumb pad to get through either a tough shift at work or helping around the house. But eventually, the drugs ran out and I crashed. Obviously couldn‚Äôt do as much. I tried to make up for what I couldn‚Äôt do in labor with affection. It was forced at that point & I couldn‚Äôt even get hard during sex bc I was just so stressed and over everything at that point. I couldn‚Äôt quit my job either bc this chick has 1,000,000 bills that never can get paid off & she just kept adding more to it. But I had to bite my tongue to prevent a divorce, until one day I didn‚Äôt. An argument started one day bc a.) I didn‚Äôt go to her uncle‚Äôs Memorial Day lake party b.) I didn‚Äôt want to give her the sheets from my side of the bed to wash (we had a 2 Twin XL King bed thing). She mostly was upset I spent Memorial Day alone. I was depressed. My head spun with thoughts of vets that gave kts & why. Or soldiers, airmen, marines, and seamen (lol), who died in combat, and what they‚Äôd think about my sorry ass moping over my back. I finally just exploded. I said ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre in my f*king way.‚Äù She broke down in tears and asked how she could not be, offering to sell a horse we don‚Äôt use to pay off bills, or telling her b-word ass dad to kick the bucket on his horse selling business idea. I cried too bc I finally thought we were getting somewhere. So I went to work thinking things were looking up. I was so hopeful, only for her to tell me on my lunch break that we were getting divorced. I begged and begged again, but she was firm this time. She also said she wanted to be amicable in our divorce, but apparently ‚Äúamicable‚Äù means ‚Äúlet me steam roll you and you just take it without a fight.‚Äù Not my style, so obviously things are getting nasty.

I've been enjoying the cooler mornings and evenings that come with fall, not to mention the leaves beginning to change from green to all those shades of yellow, orange, and red.

I don‚Äôt make as much time for it as I should, but just sitting outside with a cup of coffee breathing in some fresh air, or having a drink in the evening after work... it just feels good. I really should make that a priority more often, at least for the evening drink. The morning coffee is a bit of a logistical challenge, though I imagine someone would get a kick out of watching me roll my office chair out the front door just to enjoy it for 15 minutes. Taking a walk is nice too, but that feels like it has a purpose. It's just not the same as taking a moment to sit and think about absolutely nothing.

On a completely different note, has anyone else noticed how flimsy coffee cups have become? I get it, Styrofoam isn't good for the environment, but feeling like the bottom is about to fall out or burning my hand through the cup isn't a great trade-off.

Make my heart skip a beat like it does when I accidentally walk up/down a curb that I did not know was there. You get the gist of it‚Ä¶ 

I lost my eyesight seven years ago, so it‚Äôs still relatively new. But I don‚Äôt let it stop me from enjoying this beautiful thing called life. That‚Äôs a big reason why I want to find something real , because sharing life with someone would be pretty rad. What‚Äôs the point of happiness if you can‚Äôt share it with someone else?

I‚Äôm in a really good place in my life. After losing my sight, I went back to school and pursued a new career path that has been very fulfilling. Now, I help people every day and run my own small business. That shit is pretty exciting lol.

I stay busy with work, hobbies, and the tribe of people I care about. You can often find me listening to music or podcasts, taking audiobook suggestions (that I probably won‚Äôt follow through on), getting out in nature ‚Ä¶ especially near the ocean, which is my favorite place , or playing the drums, because I‚Äôve come to believe the guitar is a lie and no one can actually play it.

Family and friends are incredibly important to me, and I hope they‚Äôre a priority for you, too. I‚Äôll never get jealous of you making time for the people who matter to you. These days, the only kind of jealousy I feel is toward people born on January 1st, 2000  because of how easy it is for them to do the math when someone asks their age.

Yes, physical attraction is important to some, but I seek more of a spiritual connection. I‚Äôm happy to send a photo if you‚Äôre interested. For reference, I‚Äôm a 6‚Äô2‚Äù white male with a shaved head, an amazing beard, and I fit into the chubby athletic/dad bod category. So what am I looking for? 
Monogamy is very important to me. I‚Äôm a loyal, caring, emotionally intelligent man who thrives on balance. I‚Äôm looking for a relationship built on communication, reciprocation, and a mutual desire to grow together‚Ä¶ the kind where both people keep pouring into each other. Intentionality is a big part of my daily life, and I hope it is for you too.

If your life wouldn‚Äôt allow us to meet in person sometime in the near future, this might not be the right fit. I‚Äôm not looking for a purely online connection. Fortunately, my career gives me plenty of flexibility , even for relocation if the connection is right.

If you‚Äôve got your life together and are looking for someone to complement it, we might get along really well. Bonus points if you prioritize your mental and physical health. I‚Äôm not looking for a fitness fanatic, but if you walk, run, go to the gym, or do anything that helps keep your mind and body healthy, that‚Äôs a great match. It‚Äôs even better if it‚Äôs something we can do together.

Perks of dating me include: ‚Ä¢	Pre-boarding when traveling
	‚Ä¢	Excellent concert seats
	‚Ä¢	I will never look at another woman (literally)
	‚Ä¢	People being randomly super nice to us

1ndq8jh,https://v.redd.it/nqp1sky9jeof1,Working for the last 2 years solo on my little SaaS which helps retail investors to analyze every US stock company,"Hey everyone,

For the past two years, this project has been my obsession. It‚Äôs been countless late nights, endless cups of coffee, and me basically living and breathing code.

My name is Muslem Rahimi. By training, I‚Äôm a PhD physicist. I‚Äôm wired to analyze complex systems and data. But when I started investing about ten years ago, I was shocked. The system for retail investors is fundamentally broken. It felt rigged.

Why are hedge funds paying $25,000/year for a Bloomberg Terminal with instant, powerful data, while we‚Äôre stuck with 15-minute delays, ad-riddled websites, and surface-level info?

Instead of just complaining, I decided to apply my background to build a solution. I wanted to create the tool I wish I had on day one. I call it Stocknear.

My goal is not some ""get rich quick"" gimmick. It‚Äôs to level the playing field by giving you access to the same high-quality data the pros use, without the insane price tag. I‚Äôve focused on the things that give you a real edge:

1. ‚úÖ A Truly Real-Time Data Feed: Stop seeing the price move after the fact. This is tick-by-tick data straight from the source, so you can act on information, not history.
2. ‚úÖ Follow the ""Smart Money"": I was always fascinated by institutional moves, so I built trackers for unusual options activity and dark pool prints. See the massive bets happening behind the scenes, often before the story hits the news.
3. ‚úÖ No-BS Financials: Forget digging through clunky SEC filings for hours. I've aggregated and cleaned up a decade of financial statements for thousands of companies so you can do deep research in minutes.
4. ‚úÖ Your Personal AI Analyst (with a Live Pulse): This is my proudest feature. I‚Äôve fine-tuned an AI agent that has direct, real-time access to all the data powering Stocknear. You can ask it complex questions in plain English like:

My ""secret"" is that there's no fat to trim. It's just me in my apartment, building this from the ground up to be lean and powerful. There are no VCs or sales teams. It's a passion project I hope can sustain itself by helping us.

If this resonates, try it free for 7 days and see if it earns a permanent spot in your trading toolkit.

This project means the world to me. Thank you for reading this far. Any feedback is much appreciated. Please, don‚Äôt hold back.

TL;DR: I'm a physicist who got fed up with retail investors getting crappy, delayed data. I spent 2 years building Stocknear, a powerful platform with a unique AI analyst that has a live market feed.

Have you ever had one of those everyday situations where you‚Äôre just sitting around, thinking casually about someone, and out of nowhere, that exact person calls or texts you? Or maybe you casually say to a friend, ‚ÄúI feel like eating this specific dish,‚Äù and right after, they tell you they were already thinking of eating the exact same thing? Most people brush these off as simple coincidences, but if you look at it logically and with attention, you‚Äôll see they are not coincidences at all. These examples are not random; they are consistent demonstrations of how thoughts directly influence reality. Every thought you have carries information that immediately affects your surroundings. Your mind is always transmitting signals, and the results show up constantly, whether you notice them or not. Even tiny, casual thoughts trigger this effect. It‚Äôs happening all the time, every day and second, without exceptions.

Most people get it wrong because they‚Äôve been conditioned to think that results take time, effort, and external factors to occur. We are taught to associate outcomes with waiting, struggle, or complicated planning. We‚Äôre told that if something is valuable, it cannot happen instantly. But the reality we experience daily already contradicts this belief. If you pay attention, you‚Äôll notice that instant responses happen all the time. A friend messages you the exact thing you were thinking, a parking spot appears when you suddenly need one, or the perfect item is available the moment you decide to get it. These instances are subtle but consistent. They prove that timing and external conditions are not necessary for instant results. The moment your mind sends a clear signal, the corresponding outcome occurs. The only difference between noticing it and missing it is your attention and understanding.

Let‚Äôs examine why small desires appear so fast. When you think of something small, like a friend sending a message or wanting a snack, there is almost no mental resistance involved. You don‚Äôt overanalyze. You don‚Äôt calculate whether it will happen. You don‚Äôt weigh pros and cons or imagine obstacles. You simply think it, and your mind is not burdened with doubt, fear, or complexity. That thought is direct, clean, and unrestricted. It sends a signal clearly and consistently. Reality reflects it immediately because there is nothing in your mental state to block or distort it. Small desires are like signals sent without interference, which is why they manifest effortlessly. The simplicity of the thought allows it to pass through without delay, producing instant results.

Children provide a perfect example of how this works naturally. When a child wants something, they ask for it directly and without doubt. Often, it appears quickly. Why? Because a child‚Äôs mind has not yet been filled with experiences of failure, fear, or logical reasoning about ‚Äúwhat is realistic.‚Äù Their thoughts are pure, unblocked, and consistent. They do not carry the weight of past disappointments or societal conditioning. Adults, on the other hand, accumulate years of mental baggage. We learn patterns of hesitation, doubt, and analysis. These patterns create resistance. Even though the ability to manifest instantly is still present in adults, resistance from overthinking slows the reflection of desires. When adults can clear their minds and focus without clutter, the same instant results occur naturally, just like with children.

Now, let‚Äôs analyze why bigger desires seem slower to appear. It is not that the process itself is slower‚Äîinstant manifestation is always happening. The difference lies entirely in mental handling. When you think of a large desire, such as a substantial amount of money, a new job, or a meaningful relationship, your mind automatically begins to question and analyze. Thoughts like ‚ÄúHow and when will this happen?‚Äù ‚ÄúI am not sure‚Äù ‚ÄúI need another plan‚Äù ‚ÄúIs it realistic?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat if it doesn‚Äôt work out?‚Äù arise spontaneously. Each of these thoughts adds resistance. Resistance does not allow the initial thought to pass through cleanly. The original signal is disrupted and weakened, so the reflection in reality appears delayed or inconsistent. The size of the desire does not matter. What matters is the amount of interference present. The bigger the mental clutter, the slower the outcome appears.

Think about how mentally exhausting it is when you try to force a big desire while carrying resistance. Your mind contradicts itself: one part of you wants the outcome, another doubts it, and yet another questions the logistics. This internal contradiction creates a delay, even though the underlying process is instant. Small desires don‚Äôt carry this weight, so they manifest immediately. A thought about food or a simple text from a friend flows directly because it is free of contradiction. Logically, this demonstrates that manifestation speed is entirely dependent on the clarity of thought and absence of interference, not the size of the desire.

So, how can you bring big desires to the same speed as small ones? The answer is in removing mental interference. The moment you stop seeing big desires as difficult or special, you reduce the resistance they carry. You treat them casually, just like small desires. Don't put them on a pedestal. Instead of obsessing over every step or asking ‚Äúhow‚Äù or ‚Äúwhen,‚Äù you hold the thought simply and directly. Repetition of clear, straightforward thought is crucial. Each time you repeat the thought without adding unnecessary questioning, the clarity of the signal strengthens. A strong, uninterrupted signal flows immediately into reality. Clarity without interference is the key to instant reflection.

Mental habits play a significant role as well. Small desires manifest instantly because the mind does not contradict them. Big desires often carry a habitual pattern of doubt. You need to train your mind deliberately to maintain big desires without contradiction. Every time doubt arises, bring your focus back to the simple, direct thought of the desire. After it, this becomes automatic. The result is that even the largest desires manifest as easily as small ones. Mental discipline in this context is not about effort‚Äîit is about repetition, consistency, and maintaining clean thought without adding resistance.

Consistency is the final crucial element. Small desires manifest quickly because casual thinking naturally repeats throughout the day without stress. Big desires require deliberate repetition. Each repetition strengthens the clarity of the signal, reduces any remaining interference, and accelerates reflection in reality. The more consistently you maintain clear, uninterrupted thought, the faster the outcome appears. This is a natural, logical process. It does not involve waiting, luck, magic, or external alignment. Each thought you hold has an immediate effect. Clear thoughts with no interference produce instant reflection, regardless of size.

‚∏ª

>Imagine waking up on a normal morning. You‚Äôre lying in bed, casually thinking about a cup of your favorite coffee. You don‚Äôt overthink it, you just feel like having it. At the same time, your mind drifts to a bigger desire you want an unexpected extra payment in your account today. You‚Äôve been wanting it for a while, but usually, thinking about it brings doubts and ‚Äúhow will this happen?‚Äù thoughts. Today, however, you consciously decide to keep it simple: you hold the thought, ‚ÄúThis money is already here,‚Äù without asking any questions or imagining obstacles.

>Within minutes, your small desire starts reflecting immediately. You hear a knock at the door or a notification on your phone. Your friend, who knew you were planning to stay home today, texts exactly when you were thinking about coffee, asking if you want them to bring some along. Your mind barely even registered ‚ÄúI want coffee,‚Äù yet reality mirrored it instantly. There was no effort, no planning, no waiting‚Äîjust a clean, pure signal you sent, and the universe reflected it immediately.

>Now look at the bigger desire. You continue holding the thought about the extra money casually. You don‚Äôt obsess, you don‚Äôt calculate, and you don‚Äôt doubt. A few hours later, something unexpected happens. Maybe a client sends an early payment, or a friend unexpectedly gifts you money, or your bank notifies you of a cashback you hadn‚Äôt even remembered. The timing is not magical‚Äîit is purely logical. The mental signal you sent about that desire was consistent and clear, without interference. Reality responded in perfect alignment.

>Throughout the day, these instances keep happening. You casually think about ordering your favorite lunch, and moments later, a friend suggests grabbing it together. You glance at a street corner, thinking, ‚ÄúI wish I could find a parking spot right here,‚Äù and the next moment, a free space opens up exactly where you wanted. These are small desires manifesting instantly because your mental signals for them are simple, clear, and free from interference.

>Meanwhile, bigger desires are happening in the background, quietly responding to the same principle. Your clear, uninterrupted thought about the extra money or the promotion at work continues to transmit throughout the day. Every time a small doubt or question arises, you notice it and return your focus to the simple, direct thought. Each repetition strengthens the signal, gradually clearing any remaining resistance. By evening, your bank balance shows the unexpected bonus, or you receive a message from your boss offering that new opportunity. The manifestation was not delayed because of size‚Äîit was simply slower only as long as your mental interference existed. Once the interference is removed, even the biggest desires appear instantly.

>By the end of the day, you start noticing a pattern: small desires are naturally instant because your mind treats them casually, without complication. Big desires are just as instant once you treat them the same way‚Äîwithout pedestal, without overthinking, without doubt. Every moment, your mind is transmitting, and reality is reflecting. The only variable is how clean and consistent your mental signal is. Size doesn‚Äôt matter. Timing doesn‚Äôt matter. Effort doesn‚Äôt matter. Clarity, repetition, and absence of mental interference matter, and when you master that, instant manifestation becomes the natural rhythm of your life.

‚∏ª

Ultimately, the difference between small and large desires is never in the desire itself. The difference is always the state of your mind while holding it. Every thought matters. Every thought has immediate impact. Removing interference, maintaining clarity, repeating the thought consistently, and training your mind to avoid contradiction are the principles that allow any desire‚Äîsmall or large‚Äîto appear instantly. This is a logical, observable reality, evident in everyday life if you pay attention. Instant manifestation is happening all around you, and the same process that creates instant small results can be applied directly to large desires by controlling mental clarity, repetition, and resistance.

In conclusion, instant reflection is a constant, observable phenomenon. Small desires manifest effortlessly because they carry no resistance. Large desires manifest slowly only because of added mental interference. Every thought you hold has immediate impact. By keeping thoughts clear, direct, repeated, and free of contradiction, you allow even large desires to appear instantly. This is not luck or waiting. It is entirely logical, consistently observable, and practical. Every moment, your mind is broadcasting, and every moment, reality is reflecting what you hold mentally. The difference is never the size of the desire. The difference is always in how you manage your mind while holding the desire.",10,1757538093.0,MasterManifestor,1,1.0,False
1ndq6ym,https://www.reddit.com/r/irishtourism/comments/1ndq6ym/finishing_touches_on_my_october_trip/,Finishing touches on my October trip,"My wife and I (late 40s/early 50s) are visiting Ireland in October. (Attending a wedding first, and then exploring) I've got the main stops and hotels planned out, but need some advice on traveling between cities and some suggestions of things to see & do at each stop. We prefer to visit less tourist filled places, unless they are overwhelming considered ""can't miss"". We love pubs, live music, architecture, & the outdoors. We are not driving, so we will be relying on public transportation. Let me know what you think of our plans. I'd love to hear about local things to see and do at each stop!

Saturday - Arrive in Dublin. Pick up a suit. Stay in Temple Bar area. (I know. But we are with a wedding group)

Sunday - Head to Slane for the wedding. Wedding is on Tuesday. We may have a little time to explore nearby.

Wednesday - Back to Dublin early to return the suit. Travel to Westport via train early afternoon. (seats reserved)

Wednesday & Thursday - Staying in Westport

Friday - Travel from Westport to Ennis (I'm guessing bus travel here?)

Friday & Saturday - Staying in Ennis

Sunday - Travel from Ennis to Killarney (Bus again)

Sunday & Monday - Staying in Killarney

Tuesday - Travel from Killarney to Dublin via train just before noon. (seats reserved)

Tuesday & Wednesday - Staying in Dublin, leave Thursday am.

As you can see, I've got the train tickets locked in, but I'm unsure of the other travel between cities. Is it best to reserve those online ahead of time, or wait until day of? Not really sure how crowded they get. And for busses, do they all take the Leap cards? 

Also, we've got to transfer buses in Galway (for Westport to Ennis) and Limerick (for Ennis to Killarney). Doesn't look like much time in between. Better to stop for a coffee and catch a later bus? Looks like Expressway & Dublin Coach have routes - is one better than the other?

Any recommendations for best way to travel between these cities or things to do and see at each stop are greatly appreciated! Thanks!

Edit: Forgot to mention we will each have a suitcase & backpack while traveling, if that matters.",1,1757538092.0,irishtourism,7,1.0,False
1ndq6l3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ndq6l3,Resort Overview/Review/AMA - Valentin Imperial Riviera Maya,"Hello! Writing this from somewhere over Texas (and finishing it up two days later because wow this turned into a novel) on the way home after an incredible few days in the Riviera Maya touring resorts and meeting with the teams. I‚Äôm always so grateful for my time in destination because it really helps me keep a pulse on what‚Äôs going on at the properties and make sure I‚Äôm giving you and my clients the most up to date intel. Stay tuned for more content from the trip including a Grand Velas review (probably much shorter than this one, but spoiler alert - it‚Äôs a winner too).¬†

Valentin Imperial was my host for most of this trip. I am a big champion of this property on Reddit and to my clients and think they provide an excellent experience. This stay reinforced that, though of course there were a couple things that could have been better. Fair warning, this will be an excessively long review (and also sort of a guide to the resort)‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt help myself from writing. So, I‚Äôll do a quick summary up top and then go into it in excruciating detail. Promise I won‚Äôt be offended if you don‚Äôt read the whole thing. Ask any and all questions in the comments!

**Summary/TLDR**

Rooms: 8/10. Extremely clean and in good shape, though not especially exciting. Newly renovated, but feel a little dated due to the ‚ÄúHacienda‚Äù style. If you love a super modern look this won‚Äôt be a resort for you. I thought the bed/pillows were hard, personally. Would definitely consider upgrading to Golden or Emerald here. No ocean front rooms‚Ä¶ yet. Stay tuned.¬†

Food: 8.75/10. Nothing was bad, many things were excellent. French and Asian restaurants were the highlights.¬†

Drinks: 9/10. Some super sweet cocktails, though that‚Äôs par for the course. House wines were very strong for being included.¬†Great selection of liquor brands and staff didn't skimp on the pours.

Service: 10/10. Everyone was kind, caring, friendly, and went out of their way to make my stay great. Never waited for a drink, dining service was perfectly paced, and housekeeping usually was done with my room by the time I came back from breakfast.¬†

Pools: 10/10. Great variety, great service, and great entertainment. The pools were extremely warm, though that‚Äôs Cancun in September for you. Grand Velas was no better in that regard.

Beach: 8/10. I was surprised at how nice the beach was - a long walking beach with soft white sand. Very swimmable too. Some sargassum, though not too bad. There is audible construction on the north side, though I didn‚Äôt find it bothersome. Psst‚Ä¶ remember what I said above about oceanfront rooms?!

Entertainment/Activities: 9.5/10. Lots of programming, shows and live music every night. If you want a livelier resort in this price point/category, this is where you should go. FYI - spa/gym are small.¬†

Check in/out: Quick and seamless. 10/10.¬†

Timeshare pitch: NONE! The resort does not have a timeshare program. Extra credit for that.¬†

Overall: 9.25/10 = an A-. I‚Äôm a big fan of this one and will continue to advocate for it for the right client. Who is the right client? Someone who wants good food and drinks, a lively atmosphere without a full on party resort, likes the spread out tropical feel/more traditional rooms, is okay with walking a bit (or using golf carts), and doesn‚Äôt need an incredible beach would be right at home here. I elaborate a bit on who isn‚Äôt the right client at the very end of the review.¬†

**Trip Logistics**

Arrived at CUN at 3 PM on a Wednesday and walked directly to the immigration officer with zero line. Was in my Nexus transfer within five minutes of finding them outside and they were easy to find. Driver was safe and pleasant and the van was clean and cold. PSA - you can buy sunscreen for \~$16 USD in the convenience store outside T3 arrivals (not in duty free‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs whacko expensive) if you forget yours on your kitchen counter like I did and don‚Äôt realize until you‚Äôre on the plane.¬†

**Overview**

Valentin Imperial Riviera Maya is located about 30 minutes south of the Cancun Airport and 20 minutes north of Playa del Carmen. It‚Äôs a mid-sized resort by guest count at 539 rooms, however, it feels much larger because of the layout. It‚Äôs spread out into sixteen guest room buildings (each 2-3 stories) on a sprawling tropical campus (note - unless you‚Äôre on the beach, you can‚Äôt see the ocean anywhere on the property). Walking paths flanked by mangroves and jungle (and with lots of wildlife) connect the buildings to the pools, restaurants, and amenities. Generally, the resort is longer than it is wide, with the main lobby, most entertainment, and most dining at the front of the resort (closest to the road/furthest from the beach), the pools in the middle, and the beach at the back. The guest room buildings are scattered all over the place.¬†

I would put this resort in the ‚Äúpremium‚Äù category - not quite a true luxury property, but definitely an elevated experience. I would say it‚Äôs a competitor to Live Aqua, JOIA Paraiso, and El Dorado Maroma as far as quality of property goes (and SLS/Hyatt Ziva/Grand Fiesta Americana if you‚Äôre considering family friendly properties), but is a very different feel from any of them. It‚Äôs a hair below somewhere like Xcaret, Secrets Akumal/Moxche/Playa Blanca, or Atelier.¬†

Rates range from <$500/night in off season to $700-$750 ish per night in peak season (and Christmas is higher of course). This property is fairly routinely priced below a direct booking with wholesalers, and there‚Äôs usually little to no benefit to packaging with air at least on the TA side. There is some benefit to packaging on the ‚Äúdirect‚Äù site, but I put that in quotes because a booking with air on their site is actually a 3rd party and I have no idea who (vs. hotel only is truly direct). Their name isn‚Äôt even on the engine and it‚Äôs sketchy at best‚Ä¶ if you want to package, book it with a TA or some other online source.

**Rooms**

All rooms were renovated between 2018 and 2024, lowest to highest category order. All rooms are sold as tropical/garden view, though some of the 2nd floor Emerald rooms are oceanfront (no way to guarantee you get one). They are a very traditional Mexican style, so if you like sleek and modern, you might not be a big fan. I stayed in a Deluxe Junior Suite (base room) which had two double beds, a living area, and a large closed off bathroom. The room was sparkling clean and the AC was cold and strong. Great blackout curtains - I‚Äôm a light sensitive sleeper and slept until my alarm every morning. Plenty of closet space. There was a Nespresso machine and a minibar with beer, soft drinks, juices, and cold waters. The only snacks in the room were potato chips, which were tucked into the fridge.¬†

Bedding is on request here, and most rooms are Kings. If you want Doubles (only in Deluxe and Golden categories), reach out well ahead of your stay to make sure the request is on file or have your TA do it if you‚Äôre booked with one. If you want a King and book the base category, you should request it with your TA, but you can also book lots of other categories that are guaranteed Kings.

We also saw a Silver Junior Suite (very similar to the Deluxe, but with an open concept bathroom and a much larger soaking tub), a Golden Junior Suite (larger and a bit more updated, around the Golden pool, first floor are swim ups), an Emerald Junior Suite (Beachfront category, notably, not guaranteed ocean view, no elevators in these buildings PSA so request ground floor if that‚Äôs a concern), and an Onyx Suite (with a huge deck and private hot tub). FWIW, category upgrades get expensive fast here - you can very easily end up in Atelier/Moxche/Playa Blanca territory if you go for an Emerald for example. I definitely thought the room quality got nicer as the prices got higher, but when I return I think I‚Äôd be just fine with the Deluxe. If I was going to splurge, it would be for the Golden Swim Up, which is really a walk out to the Golden Pool vs. a separate swim up pool. Exclusive loungers and full food/beverage service to your terrace/swim up/pool spot? Yes please!

One bizarre oddity - there is no conditioner in the bathrooms until you get to the Emerald level. I have no idea why and it‚Äôs a weird cheapness of what is otherwise a premium resort. Bring your own if you need it.¬†

There‚Äôs no club level, but there is the ‚ÄúPrive‚Äù package ($85/person/day) which gives you bottles of liquor in the room, the ability to make dinner reservations, a reserved bali bed at either the pool or the beach, and the ability to order lobster for no extra charge. I only think it‚Äôs worth it if you‚Äôll use the pool/beach bali bed every day, and rarely book it for clients.¬†

**Food**/**Beverage**

Overall, I thought F&B was very strong. Breakfast for me was at Le Marche (the main buffet) each day because I was in building 3 and didn‚Äôt have time to go down to the beach area for alacarte. There was a large buffet with an omelet station (very good) and just about everything else you could want. I think breakfast was the weakest meal (baked goods were meh, I would have liked to see some grapes or berries in addition to the melons/pineapple/etc, and would have liked to see some variety in breakfast meats), but still very satisfying overall. FYI, the main buffet seating area is not air conditioned and was quite warm, but there is a separate air conditioned seating area that‚Äôs much more tolerable. Ask to be seated there.

I had two lunches on property - one at the main buffet and one at the poolside food truck. The main buffet was a lot of ‚Äúgood, not great‚Äù and had a huge variety of dishes from all sorts of cuisines (vs. the buffet I had at JOIA which was Asian themed that day and changes theme each day). Poolside food truck had excellent tostadas (I had shrimp and salmon) and okay tacos el pastor (the meat was overcooked and dry, though some of the folks in our group enjoyed them so maybe I got a bad batch).

Dinners were at La Hacienda (Mexican), L‚ÄôAlcase (French), Il Olivo (Italian), and Taman Sarai (Asian). I also had pre-dinner sushi at the sushi bar at Ginger (Japanese). No reservations at any restaurants (aside from Teppanyaki which you make with your building concierge) unless you‚Äôre Prive. The largest table is 6 at most restaurants, there are a few 8 tops. Expect to split if you‚Äôre a larger group than that. We did not have to wait for any of our dinners, though if we wanted inside for our Italian dinner there would have been a 30 minute wait. We opted for the patio to be seated immediately, which was warm but bearable as the sun went down.¬†

La Hacienda (7.5/10): Ceviche was okay, the caesar salad was excellent, and the mushroom crepes were very good. We ordered a whole spread of tacos/quesadillas/tostadas/etc. as our entree and I would say they were generally okay, but nothing special. This was probably the weakest dinner of the stay.

L‚ÄôAlcase (9.75/10): Beet salad with goat cheese and citrus was fantastic. Onion soup was good, though not in the traditional style - had a baked puff pastry over the whole thing and no cheese.. My filet entree was cooked perfectly and had a delicious sauce, it was clearly a very high quality cut of beef. Creme brulee was traditional and tasty to finish. Service was polished and professional. This would have been a $125-$150 dinner in NYC after wine/tax/tip and I would have thought it was a great restaurant/would go back. Definitely the most elegant feeling of the restaurants too - plan on this one if you‚Äôre celebrating something special.

Il Olivo (8/10): Arancini were overcooked and cold. Biggest miss of a dish on the whole trip. Caesar salad was okay, but the one at La Hacienda was better. The star here though was the carbonara - it was creamy, flavorful, and the pasta was cooked perfectly. I was shocked after the appetizers. Skipped dessert and went to the churro cart which is 1000/10.¬†

Taman Sarai (9/10): Tamarind chicken salad was boring and the chicken was dry. Should have ordered the spring rolls instead‚Ä¶ stole a bite of my friends and they were delicious. The smoked duck entree absolutely made up for it and then some though - cooked perfectly, the sauce was perfectly sweet without being cloying, the rice was tasty, and the veggies were fresh and bright. 10/10 dish, no notes. Tiramisu was perfectly good, though not special.

Sushi bar (7.5/10): A fun novelty to do, but if you‚Äôre a fan of good sushi, you‚Äôll be disappointed here. Lots of cream cheese, rice, fillers and sauces, not a lot of fish. The fish was decent quality (it‚Äôs not going to make you sick or anything), but nothing special. I‚Äôd call it all slightly better than grocery store sushi but my local good sushi spot in SLC is way better. FYI - seating here is very competitive. We got there at opening and got the last couple spots. I don‚Äôt believe they serve the sushi menu at the regular tables either, which is odd to me.¬†

Service was on point at all of the dinner restaurants. Wait staff were friendly and polite and I thought the meals moved along at a good pace. My wine glass was never empty!

My lattes from Cafe Sisal (the coffee shop) were pretty good, though weak. I‚Äôd order double shots next time. A chocolate croissant from there was dry and forgettable (generally, the bakery was not the culinary programs strong suit).

P.S. do not miss the churro cart out in the plaza. They make them hot and fresh to order and fill them with vanilla/caramel and they are absolutely divine. Open every night except Saturday.

**Service**

Universally excellent. Every single employee would go out of their way to be friendly, from a simple ‚Äúbuenos dias‚Äù from folks you passed by to folks offering to show you the way somewhere, recommended cocktails, engage in conversation if you seemed interested, and genuinely show that they cared about your stay. Valentin has a reputation for being a great employer in the region and I think it helps them attract great people. Many of the employees have been at the resort for a long time and it‚Äôs clear that they are proud of the product they put out.

Tipping: Please tip if you can. The staff work very very hard to make your stay great, and don‚Äôt make much. A little bit goes a long way. If you really want to make some people‚Äôs day, make it a point to tip the people who don‚Äôt usually get tipped - the landscapers, maintenance folks, sargassum cleaners on the beach, etc. A ‚Äúmuchas gracias‚Äù along with a couple bucks or a 20 peso bill means so much to them, and their work is just as meaningful to the resort as the servers/bartenders/baristas/housekeepers who are more commonly tipped. Let‚Äôs show them that their jobs are important.¬†

Most people seemed to tip in USD and the staff seemed happy with either. I tipped in Pesos because silly me forgot to go to the ATM before I left home and so I had to get cash at the Cancun airport. The ATM is straight ahead as you exit Customs next to the bathrooms, 34 pesos fee, decline the conversion and let your bank do it. The resort had no issue exchanging 500 peso bills for 20s and 50s at the front desk.¬†

**Pools**

There are two main pool areas - the ‚Äúmain pool‚Äù and the golden pool. The main pool is huge and is unofficially divided into two sections - the ‚Äúparty section‚Äù closer to the restaurants (where the two swim up bars are) and the ‚Äúchill section‚Äù closer to the beach, though it‚Äôs all one pool. There are fountains, bubblers, a cool bridge, and a shallow area with chairs in the pool.¬†

Loungers surround the main pool (plus some in shaded palapa areas just behind), and at 70% occupancy there were many empty chairs even in the early afternoon when I finally made it to the pool. One miss - there are no umbrellas for chairs, so you‚Äôll have to be in the palapa if you want shade. There are also reserved cabanas for Prive guests towards the chill section. Prive is I believe the only way to get a cabana here - as far as I know, you cannot buy them by the day.¬†

The party section is where the entertainment is - things like aquagym, belly dancing, trivia, volleyball, etc. I wouldn‚Äôt mistake it for a party resort pool, but it felt more lively than the pool at comparable resorts like Live Aqua or Atelier. Two large swim up bars are available - the one closer to the chill section was much less busy than the one in the middle of the party section.

The golden pool is the relaxation pool. There is poolside bar and food service, but no entertainment. If you have a golden swim up, you‚Äôll really have a walk out to this pool (15 steps from your room to the pool, with your reserved loungers in that space) vs. a true ‚Äúswim up‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt spend much time by this one aside from taking a couple pics. They call it a lazy river, but it really isn‚Äôt.¬†

There is also the silver pool which is right next to the main pool. It‚Äôs a small lap pool - I didn‚Äôt see anyone in there when I wandered over.¬†

Poolside service was prompt - never waited more than a minute or two for someone to take my order once I sat down in a chair and was checked on frequently for refills. Best drink I had was a frozen mango margarita. They‚Äôll use well spirits by default (at least at the pool) but ask for something nicer (it‚Äôs all on the bar in plain sight) in your drink and they‚Äôll be happy to oblige. Nothing ultra premium, but plenty of high quality recognizable brands - 1800, Cazadores, El Jimador, etc. were all present for tequilas, Makers Mark was back there for bourbon, and Bombay Sapphire for gin. The spirit selection seemed the same at each bar.¬†

There are thick blue foam mats for floating/lounging in all of the pools, and there are many available. No need to bring your own floats if you like that style.

**Beach**

Surprisingly good. Long sand walking beach that stretches on quite a ways in each direction. The water was blue, the sargassum was fairly minimal, and the crew on the beach removing it was doing a good job. Waves were good sized, but not so large to knock you off your feet. It‚Äôs swimmable towards the north end - turn left when you enter the beach and you‚Äôll see the lifeguard/people in the water. There are quite a few Prive cabanas on the beach when you first enter, the ‚Äúgeneral seating‚Äù is up towards the north/left side. I‚Äôve heard complaints that beach chairs can be tough to get when the resort is at full occupancy, but that wasn‚Äôt an issue here.

Sargassum can be nasty here when it‚Äôs really bad, FYI, though the beach is separated from the resort enough that I don‚Äôt think the smell will permeate too badly. I wouldn‚Äôt book this resort if a great beach is an absolute must have, but I enjoyed it as a beach lover and think it‚Äôll be just fine for most people.¬†

There is drink service on the beach, but no food service. The sunset bar at the entrance to the beach is a great spot to hang out, especially as the day slips into evening and it gets a little cooler with the nice breeze off the ocean.

**Entertainment/Activities**

This is an active resort with a lot going on (though you don‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre missing out if you don‚Äôt do any of it). During the daytime, there‚Äôs a pretty consistent program going on on the ‚Äúparty side‚Äù of the main pool. There‚Äôs activities on the beach (volleyball etc.) as well as non-motorized watersports available for rent. There are basketball and pickleball courts available. There are dance classes, cooking classes, tequila tastings, bike tours, fitness classes, and more - the ‚Äúgo team‚Äù does a great job with the daily program. Schedule is on the app (really a web link) - they‚Äôll go over how to access it at check in with you.¬†

There is live music every night in the plaza/courtyard (along with a small open air bar - there are a couple around the main area along with waiter service) and often in other venues as well. Don Miguel is the cocktail bar and usually has live music at ‚Äúhappy hour‚Äù. Some great drinks in there and some misses - I really enjoyed the hibiscus martini but thought the chocolate martini was cloyingly sweet. Service, like everywhere else, was excellent. There is also the ‚ÄúSports and music bar‚Äù which I never stepped foot in but seemed like a good time.¬†

Nightly shows at 9 PM are high quality productions - I caught a bit of the ‚ÄúLatin night‚Äù show and the choreography was impressive! There‚Äôs usually dancing/nightlife after the shows, though I was in bed well before it happened so can‚Äôt speak to the attendance.

The gym is small, but there and very functional for a workout. The spa is also small and mostly offers massages. There‚Äôs a sauna and steam room available to you if you get a treatment, but no hydrotherapy. I would not pick this resort if you‚Äôre a huge spa person.¬†

**Grounds**

Lush and tropical, with lots of wildlife. You‚Äôll see coatis, iguanas, birds, insects, etc. They do a good job keeping things swept and clean, but if a leaf (or an iguana) on the path is going to freak you out, you should go to the Hotel Zone instead. The resort is large - expect 10-15 minutes of walking from the beach to the front dining area/reception. If you‚Äôd rather take a golf cart, you can call one on demand from your room and they‚Äôre roaming around to take you back. There are some sneaky shortcuts through buildings to get to the pool/beach/dining faster - make sure to study the map.

**Overall**

This resort is a winner for a lot of different reasons. Solid dining, a decent beach, amazing pools, excellent entertainment and a variety of activities, many opportunities for peace and quiet, extremely friendly service, and great value at the price point make it a no brainer for a lot of travelers. I will absolutely suggest it for the right client and have yet to have unhappy feedback from folks here.However, it‚Äôs not for everyone (and no resort is). I would not book it if you want something compact, want a guaranteed spectacular beach, don‚Äôt like nature/the tropical feel, want super modern rooms/a modern aesthetic (the whole place feels classic Mexican), want a true party resort, want a true lazy river, want luxury level service/food (for that‚Ä¶ stay tuned for Grand Velas), or want an amazing spa. I would also not book it if you want the oceanfront feel - you can‚Äôt see the ocean from anywhere on property unless you are on the beach.

None of this is the fault of the resort though, more so that there‚Äôs a resort for every style and every guest has their own style. The tricky part is always finding the right match between guest and resort, and I think a lot of rough reviews can come from when the match wasn‚Äôt the right one to begin with. This subreddit is a goldmine to get helpful information on resorts (along with many other places on the internet) but don‚Äôt be shy about reaching out to a good travel advisor to get their thoughts as well. Someone who visits and stays at resorts and has seen many is who you want on your team. The more they‚Äôve stayed at/visited/sold/know, the better a matchmaker they can be between you and your perfect resort for your wants/needs/budget. Chat with the TA you‚Äôre considering working with, and don‚Äôt be afraid to ask them a few questions to make sure they have the right experience for you.¬†

1ndq5o4,https://v.redd.it/7901zoydieof1,Working for the last 2 years solo on my little SaaS which helps retail investors to analyze every US stock company,"Hey everyone,

For the past two years, this project has been my obsession. It‚Äôs been countless late nights, endless cups of coffee, and me basically living and breathing code.

My name is Muslem Rahimi. By training, I‚Äôm a PhD physicist. I‚Äôm wired to analyze complex systems and data. But when I started investing about ten years ago, I was shocked. The system for retail investors is fundamentally broken. It felt rigged.

Why are hedge funds paying $25,000/year for a Bloomberg Terminal with instant, powerful data, while we‚Äôre stuck with 15-minute delays, ad-riddled websites, and surface-level info?

Instead of just complaining, I decided to apply my background to build a solution. I wanted to create the tool I wish I had on day one. I call it Stocknear.

My goal is not some ""get rich quick"" gimmick. It‚Äôs to level the playing field by giving you access to the same high-quality data the pros use, without the insane price tag. I‚Äôve focused on the things that give you a real edge:

1. ‚úÖ A Truly Real-Time Data Feed: Stop seeing the price move after the fact. This is tick-by-tick data straight from the source, so you can act on information, not history.
2. ‚úÖ Follow the ""Smart Money"": I was always fascinated by institutional moves, so I built trackers for unusual options activity and dark pool prints. See the massive bets happening behind the scenes, often before the story hits the news.
3. ‚úÖ No-BS Financials: Forget digging through clunky SEC filings for hours. I've aggregated and cleaned up a decade of financial statements for thousands of companies so you can do deep research in minutes.
4. ‚úÖ Your Personal AI Analyst (with a Live Pulse): This is my proudest feature. I‚Äôve fine-tuned an AI agent that has direct, real-time access to all the data powering Stocknear. You can ask it complex questions in plain English like:



My ""secret"" is that there's no fat to trim. It's just me in my apartment, building this from the ground up to be lean and powerful. There are no VCs or sales teams. It's a passion project I hope can sustain itself by helping us.



If this resonates, try it free for 7 days and see if it earns a permanent spot in your trading toolkit.

This project means the world to me. Thank you for reading this far. Any feedback is much appreciated. Please, don‚Äôt hold back.



TL;DR: I'm a physicist who got fed up with retail investors getting crappy, delayed data. I spent 2 years building Stocknear, a powerful platform with a unique AI analyst that has a live market feed.

My ortho thinks it's possible that I can improve my symptoms enough in PT to not need surgery, at least for many years.  

Most of the studies that have shown this is possible have been on atraumatic tears, and mine was sudden, from lifting a heavy object.  But my Dr has reason to believe that tendon was weak/had micro tears already that made it ready to go under the wrong strain.  That plus the small size is why he believes that I might get relief from just PT.

A few days ago, I had a really bad fall that resulted in my severe pain and weakness in both shoulders approximately where the insertion point for the bicep is.  I can barely lift my arms forward and up, and even lifting a coffee cup causes pain.  It's worse on the left shoulder.  Yesterday, when I was trying to lift my arm, I  felt the ball clearly slip out of and then pop back in to the socket again.

I want to know if it's possible generally for someone to have that level of pain and disability from a sprain, or something else that could heal on its own, or if these symptoms are generally more associated with a tendon or ligament tear that needs surgery.  I've messaged my doctor to see if I should get more imaging and of course, will listen to what he says, but it's going to be a while before I can see him and I'd like to understand what is like likely to be going on so I can prepare for that possibility.",1,1757538010.0,Orthopedics,0,1.0,False

I feed discreetly using BF friendly tops and couldn't cover up more plus DS doesn't like his head covered. Tried mentioning to them that they are welcome to be in the room whilst I feed but both of them didn't really reply just changed the subject rather quickly.


Longer version: I'm temporarily staying with my husband's family, MIL, FIL and BIL. We have finished uni and are finding jobs in our new fields and plan to relocate wherever we can. My husband's family have allowed us to stay at theirs to be closer to my husband's current job as I'm on mat leave until March at the latest but hoping to find new job ASAP (700+ applications sent already). I have EBF and not used bottles the entire time which was known to them prior to moving in however MIL didn't BF so BF is rather a new thing for them all.

I understand they wish to give privacy however I have moved to a city that I know nobody still after being here 6 weeks. I'm trying out different mum and craft groups but not really found anywhere that suits yet. The loneliness has kicked in as my husband and MIL work long hours and the only other people in the house will walk into a room see I'm nursing and walk straight out or go behind the door then talk to me. I understand it can take some getting used to but I don't understand why it's getting worse than better. I also feel like an inconvenience to them already and their reactions are making me even more aware of it and like one that's no longer as welcomed. This evening my FIL came into the lounge with a cup of coffee and a book saw me had a look that read as oh you're doing that negatively and rather than sit in his arm chair left and sat looking awkward in their dining room (which he doesn't usually do).

Whilst nursing I use my BF friendly tops that lift up and to the side so very little is available let alone able to be seen once DS has latched either. I don't use any of my nursing tanks that simply unclipped down unless in our bedroom as I personally don't feel comfortable showing that much in front of them either so I'm literally exposing only what is needed and whilst he's already positioned blocking any sight.

I mentioned it to my husband and he said he'd talk to them but I don't think he has. I made passing comments about them not needing to do so but they tried to ignore the topic and changed the topic quickly without really replying. I really wish that I was reading too into this but my husband sees it too. 

I wish to note my MIL is great. Since mentioning being lonely she takes time to chat a bit after her shifts before going to bed and hasn't mentioned anything bad or acted strange with me feeding at any point ",1,1757538000.0,breastfeeding,0,1.0,False

Chapter One

Tom Hart stepped off the plane into Brooklyn, the city hitting him like a fist to the jaw. It was his first time back since before the war, and he was here for the funeral of his pal Jimmy Grillo.

They‚Äôd grown up together in Bensonhurst, two kids on the corner of 66th and 17th, not bad but not saints either. They raised hell in their own small way‚Äîswiping candy from corner stores, sneaking beers, mouthing off to cops who didn‚Äôt care enough to chase them.

The worst was senior year, when a neighborhood thief named Poopoo slipped them ten bucks each to boost a car for a jewelry store heist. They pulled it off, hearts pounding, but it left a sour taste. 

That was right before graduation, before they enlisted in the Army to fight in WW2‚ÄîNormandy, bullets, and blood they never talked about, not then, not ever.

Now Jimmy was dead, his skull cracked open by a crowbar outside Regina Pacis Church at 11 p.m. Tom‚Äôs gut churned. Some debts you can‚Äôt bury, and he owed Jimmy this much: find the bastard who did it.

The cops called it a mugging gone wrong, a straightforward case. They figured the punk meant to knock Jimmy Grillo out, grab his wallet, and run, but adrenaline turned a crowbar swing into a skull-crushing blow that stole his life.

Jimmy worked the graveyard shift as a security guard at Maimonides Hospital. Wednesday was one of his two nights off, and he‚Äôd taken his shih tzu, Lucy, for a walk. Eleven p.m. was his usual hour, and Bensonhurst‚Äôs quiet streets were supposed to be safe. Murders didn‚Äôt happen here‚Äînot like this.

When the police rolled up to Regina Pacis Church, they found Jimmy sprawled on the pavement, head bashed in, barely clinging to life. Lucy huddled beside him, licking his hand, her small body trembling as if she could will him back.

Ann Grillo‚Äôs voice cracked over the phone, tears choking her words but fighting to stay steady. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs dead, Tom. They smashed his skull with a crowbar. Animals! They took him from me.‚Äù

Tom gripped the receiver, rage boiling under his skin. ‚ÄúDid they get the scumbags who did it?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Ann said, voice raw. ‚ÄúCops call it a mugging gone too far. But I think Carmine‚Äôs mixed up in it. Jimmy was betting, said he owed a grand. That‚Äôs big money for him, Tom. I think Carmine took it out in blood.‚Äù

Tom exhaled, steadying himself. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get through the funeral, Ann. Then I‚Äôll start asking around, sniff out what‚Äôs what. It‚Äôs been over twenty years since I left Brooklyn, but I still know the streets‚Äîand who talks.‚Äù

Tom Hart‚Äôs flight from L.A. touched down at LaGuardia at noon. He rented a sedan, tossed his bag in the trunk, and gunned it toward Ann‚Äôs place in Bensonhurst.

Dark clouds choked the New York sky, promising thunderstorms‚Äîa far cry from the sun-soaked L.A. streets he‚Äôd left behind. The weather mirrored his mood, heavy and brooding. 

Jimmy Grillo had problems, big ones. He drank too much, bet too much, spent too much, and fooled around with nurses on the night shift at Maimonides Hospital.

But he didn‚Äôt deserve a crowbar to the skull outside Regina Pacis Church. Ann should‚Äôve walked out years ago, but she stuck by him, always hoping he‚Äôd clean up. 

Tom and Jimmy had drifted to Christmas cards once a year. After the war, Jimmy came back to Brooklyn; Tom started fresh, joining the LAPD and marrying Elaine, now his ex-wife.

The force wore Tom down, so he retired early, trading his badge for a private investigator‚Äôs license. The divorce gutted him‚Äîpension slashed, alimony bleeding him dry‚Äîleaving no time to reconnect with old pals.

But Jimmy‚Äôs murder hit Tom like a slug to the chest, and he‚Äôd tear Brooklyn apart to find the one‚Äôs who did it.

Tom pulled up to Ann‚Äôs place, a cramped apartment in a four-family house on a worn-out Bensonhurst block. For five years, she and Jimmy had scraped by, always making rent, even if it meant skipping meals now and then.

Ann worked manicures at a beauty parlor a block away on 65th Street, her hands steady despite the life she‚Äôd been dealt. Jimmy‚Äôs insurance policy through Maimonides Hospital would cover the funeral and maybe square his debt with Carmine, the bookie who‚Äôd come sniffing for his grand.

Dead, Jimmy was providing better than he ever did alive. But it was unsustainable, and something had to break. A crowbar to the skull outside Regina Pacis Church, at the cost of his life‚Äîthat was too damn high.

‚ÄúTom, it‚Äôs good to see you,‚Äù Ann said, her voice breaking as she hugged him. ‚ÄúI only wish Jimmy was here.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know, Ann. It‚Äôs hard. The whole damn thing‚Äôs unbelievable,‚Äù Tom replied, his words heavy, like gravel in his throat.

‚ÄúI‚Äôd ask you to stay, but it‚Äôs a one-bedroom, and I‚Äôm afraid of what folks might think.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo problem. Got a room at a hotel in Bay Ridge. You‚Äôve got enough on your mind,‚Äù Tom said, his eyes scanning the cramped apartment, thick with grief.

‚ÄúThe funeral‚Äôs tomorrow at Regina Pacis, then straight to the cemetery for burial. Couldn‚Äôt afford a wake,‚Äù Ann said, her voice small.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre doing the best you can under the circumstances,‚Äù Tom said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll check into my room and see you at the church in the morning.‚Äù

‚ÄúRegina Pacis always brought me peace,‚Äù Ann said, eyes welling up. ‚ÄúNow I‚Äôll only see Jimmy lying there, skull smashed.‚Äù

‚ÄúGet some rest, Ann. I‚Äôll stick around after and find out what I can. I‚Äôll start digging right after the cemetery.‚Äù

Before checking into his Bay Ridge hotel, Tom swung by the old club on the corner of 17th Avenue, the hangout where he and Jimmy raised hell as kids. 

He left his .38 in the glove compartment and stepped inside, the air thick with cigar smoke and suspicion. He nodded at the bartender. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here for Carmine.‚Äù

A burly brute of a bodyguard loomed by a back room door, his gravelly voice like he‚Äôd been breathing cigars since the womb. ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs asking?‚Äù

‚ÄúHart. Tom Hart. Grew up down the block before I left for the war,‚Äù Tom said, holding his ground.

A slick-dressed man, about forty, handsome but sharp as a switchblade, waved Tom over from a corner table. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Carmine. What do you want?‚Äù he asked, his eyes piercing Tom‚Äôs like a blade.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm settling Jimmy Grillo‚Äôs debt. What‚Äôs he owe you?‚Äù

Carmine leaned back, sizing him up. ‚ÄúJimmy owed me a hundred before he got himself killed. Always paid on time, so forget it.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it?‚Äù Tom asked, startled, searching Carmine‚Äôs face for a lie.

‚ÄúYou deaf? It‚Äôs settled. Now get out before I change my mind,‚Äù Carmine snapped.

Tom hustled out, the club‚Äôs haze clinging to his coat. Someone was lying. Ann swore Jimmy owed Carmine a grand, but Carmine claimed a hundred, already forgiven. 

Maybe Jimmy fed Ann a story to pocket cash for his dames and dice. Or maybe Ann was hiding something. 

A random mugging? Tom wasn‚Äôt buying it‚Äînot with a crowbar splitting Jimmy‚Äôs skull outside Regina Pacis Church.

He checked into his hotel, grabbed a greasy diner burger, and chewed over the case. 

He‚Äôd wait until tomorrow‚Äôs funeral to tell Ann about Carmine, face-to-face. He needed to see her eyes when he dropped the news. If Jimmy wasn‚Äôt lying, she was.

And Tom Hart trusted only what he could see with his own eyes.

Chapter Two

Tom Hart was up early the morning of Jimmy Grillo‚Äôs funeral, the weight of the day heavy as a .38 in his hand. Ann had made arrangements at Aievoli Funeral Parlor on 12th Avenue, across from Regina Pacis Church.

The casket was closed; no viewing, but the family, essentially Ann and Tom, could say their goodbyes before it was carried to the church for the funeral mass, then to Greenwood Cemetery for burial.

Monsignor Coffey himself was leading the mass, his jaw tight over the publicity tainting his church. He was pushing to have Regina Pacis named a Basilica, and a murder on its steps wasn‚Äôt helping. 

The papers, hungry for ink, dubbed it ‚ÄúThe Skull Crowbar Murder,‚Äù splashing Jimmy‚Äôs name across headlines. Some yellow journalists even spun tales of a fling between Jimmy and a young nun from the convent, anything to sell copies.

Tom Hart sat in his Bay Ridge hotel room, jotting down names of people tied to Jimmy Grillo‚Äôs murder‚Äînot suspects yet, but players who might know something worth hearing.

First on his list, right after the burial, was Homicide Detective Mike Fox at the 69th Precinct. Mike was a neighborhood guy, a high school acquaintance of Tom and Jimmy‚Äôs, not quite a friend but close enough to share a past on the wrestling team, scrapping in the same sweaty gym.

He also needed to face Ann about Carmine. If Jimmy‚Äôs debt was really a grand, like Ann claimed, Carmine‚Äôs quick dismissal of a hundred bucks could be a dodge to keep the cops off his back. Leaning on a grieving widow for her dead husband‚Äôs gambling debts‚Äîespecially if Carmine swung the crowbar‚Äîwould draw too much heat.

But first, Mike. Tom needed whatever the detective knew, anything to explain why a crowbar cracked Jimmy‚Äôs skull outside Regina Pacis Church.

Tom parked in Aievoli‚Äôs lot at eight sharp, the first to arrive. He took a front-row seat in the viewing room, his eyes locked on Jimmy Grillo‚Äôs closed casket, the weight of the moment heavier than his .38.

He was piecing together what he had. Carmine was the easy suspect, but Tom‚Äôs years on the force taught him the obvious rarely held up. Then there was Ann, the widow. Much as he wanted to believe her clean, he‚Äôd be a lousy PI if he didn‚Äôt consider her. A thousand bucks, she‚Äôd said‚Äîyet Carmine claimed a hundred, already forgiven. Someone was lying.

He‚Äôd need to hit Maimonides Hospital, where Jimmy worked security, to grill his bosses and coworkers. Anything‚Äîa grudge, a debt, a jealous nurse‚Äîcould fit the puzzle of a crowbar splitting Jimmy‚Äôs skull.

Then there were Monsignor Coffey and the priests at Regina Pacis. The murder went down on their doorstep. Did they see something and hold back, protecting their church‚Äôs bid for Basilica status?

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see,‚Äù Tom muttered to Jimmy‚Äôs coffin, a vow to leave no stone unturned.

Ann walked into Aievoli‚Äôs viewing room, dressed in a black top and slacks‚Äîno black dress in her closet, but grief didn‚Äôt care about wardrobe. 

She knelt before Jimmy‚Äôs closed casket, crossing herself, her whispered Hail Mary carrying a promise to Jimmy: she was here with Tom, and everything would be alright.

She sank into the pew beside Tom, and he gave her hand a gentle squeeze, his eyes hard but steady. Four women from the beauty parlor on 65th Street, where Ann worked, slipped in to pay respects before their shift, their heels clicking softly on the floor.

The funeral director stepped in, voice low, directing everyone to say their goodbyes. The casket would soon head across 65th Street to Regina Pacis for the mass, then to Greenwood Cemetery for burial.

Outside, the early fall day was partly cloudy, a cool breeze cutting through Brooklyn‚Äôs heavy air. Tom and Ann crossed toward Regina Pacis, dipping fingers in holy water as they entered, the faint scent of incense lingering from the 7 a.m. mass. They genuflected and took the front pew, the only family there. 

The four beauty parlor women sat five rows back, while seven of Jimmy‚Äôs coworkers from Maimonides Hospital‚Äôs overnight shift scattered across the first three rows‚Äîtwo nurses among them, maybe too ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù with Jimmy.

At nine o‚Äôclock, a bell rang, sharp like a Good Humor cart‚Äôs chime. The congregation rose, and Monsignor Coffey emerged from the sacristy, his face stern. 

Five reporters from the Daily News, New York Post, and local tabloids hovered, snapping photos of Ann as she entered. She ducked her head, dodging their lenses.

Monsignor delivered a stirring mass, his homily painting Jimmy as a devoted husband, friend, and coworker‚Äîa good man, crowbar or not. 

He glared at the press, demanding respect for Ann‚Äôs grief, his voice carrying the weight of a man protecting his church‚Äôs bid for Basilica status.

After communion, the congregation filed out, Monsignor trailing the hearse to Greenwood Cemetery alongside Tom and Ann. The reporters tagged along, relentless. Monsignor, a stout, imposing figure, barked at them to do their jobs but offered no comment, his role strictly pastoral.

Tom shot hard stares at anyone who dared approach Ann, his policeman grit promising trouble. The vultures kept their distance.

Monsignor Coffey stood over the coffin at Greenwood Cemetery, splashing holy water and reciting the funeral liturgy, his voice steady against the fall breeze. The sparse, intimate ceremony was one Jimmy would‚Äôve nodded approval at, simple and honest.

When it ended, the funeral director handed Ann and Tom roses to lay on the casket before they turned away. Tom‚Äôs eyes caught a skinny, wiry kid, about twenty-five, in a white tee with a pack of Marlboros rolled in his sleeve, leaning against a tree a dozen yards off, keeping his distance.

Tom had clocked him earlier, slouched in the last pew by Regina Pacis‚Äôs front door during the mass. At first, he figured the kid was there for a personal prayer, not the funeral. Now it was clear‚Äîhe was watching.

As Tom and Ann headed to the car, he caught the faintest glance and smile flicker between her and the kid. Tom‚Äôs gut tightened. Something was brewing between them, something he needed to unravel.

Tom took Ann to the Americana  Diner on 65th Street for brunch after the burial, settling into a booth in the back room, the one with cracked vinyl seats and no frills. 

He ordered a western omelet with toast and home fries. Ann wasn‚Äôt hungry, her eyes hollow. Tom nudged her to eat, and she settled for a soft-boiled egg, toast, and black coffee.

‚ÄúGlad you‚Äôre eating something,‚Äù Tom said, his voice low. ‚ÄúLast thing you need is to make yourself sick now.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right,‚Äù Ann replied, staring at her plate. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just glad it‚Äôs over. I‚Äôll grab the death certificates from the funeral parlor and head home. It‚Äôs hitting me hard, Tom‚Äîknowing he‚Äôs really gone.‚Äù

Tom leaned forward, his gaze steady. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got good news. You don‚Äôt have to worry about Carmine. I saw him yesterday. He said Jimmy owed him a hundred bucks, not a grand, and he‚Äôs eating it under the circumstances. But here‚Äôs the thing, Ann‚Äîhe said a hundred, you said a thousand. Someone‚Äôs lying.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt me, Tom,‚Äù she shot back, her voice sharp. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd never lie to you, especially not now.‚Äù

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt mean you,‚Äù Tom said, easing back. ‚ÄúJimmy might‚Äôve fed you a story about the money.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh,‚Äù Ann said, her shoulders loosening, but her eyes flickered. ‚ÄúI should‚Äôve known that‚Äôs what you meant. I‚Äôm just wound up, is all.‚Äù

Tom paid the check and dropped her off at Aievoli‚Äôs to finish her business. Her quick defense gnawed at him, like she was hiding more than grief. 

Jimmy was likely the liar, pocketing cash for his dames or dice, but Ann‚Äôs reaction‚Äîand that wiry kid in the white tee at the cemetery‚Äîkept Tom‚Äôs instincts on edge.

He let it go for now. Two weeks, three at most, before he had to head back to L.A. to make a living. That wasn‚Äôt much time to crack a murder case, and he had a long list of people to shake down for answers.

Chapter Three

Tom climbed the steps of the 69th Precinct on 16th Avenue, a memory flickering like a worn-out film reel. 

He and Jimmy, hauled in by Officer Beales for disorderly conduct, kids mouthing off on the corner of 17th Avenue. Beales had barked at them twice to scatter. 

They‚Äôd shuffle off, only to slink back once his patrol car vanished.
The third time, three squad cars screeched up, sirens howling like they were nabbing Al Capone. Beales dragged their crew to the precinct, parents called, lectures delivered. Tom‚Äôs lips twitched with wry nostalgia.

But the past faded fast. This wasn‚Äôt about kids defying a surly cop. Jimmy‚Äôs skull was cracked open outside Regina Pacis Church, and Tom had a murder to unravel.

Stepping into the 69th Precinct on 16th Avenue, Tom felt nostalgia surge. The place was frozen in time: same metal desks and chairs, caked with ten layers of chipped paint; same holding cage with a flimsy lock begging to be busted; same faded ‚ÄúCop of the Month‚Äù photo framed on the wall, mocking the room‚Äôs grit.

At the main desk, centered like a judge‚Äôs bench, Tom blinked, half-convinced he was seeing ghosts. Officer Beales‚Äînow Sergeant Beales‚Äîsat barking orders, chewing out a DWI suspect with the same scowl he‚Äôd worn hauling Tom and Jimmy in as kids.

Tom wasn‚Äôt here to swap old stories. He caught a female officer‚Äôs eye. ‚ÄúDetective Fox?‚Äù She pointed to an office down the hall.

Tom stepped in, leaning against the doorframe. ‚ÄúMike, remember me? Tom Hart. Last time I saw you, I had you in a full nelson.‚Äù

Mike Fox looked up, a grin cracking his weathered face. ‚ÄúTom? Hell, it‚Äôs been twenty-five years. Heard you were on the job in L.A. How‚Äôs it treating you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI left the LAPD five years back,‚Äù Tom said, leaning back in Mike Fox‚Äôs cluttered office. ‚ÄúStarted my own PI shop. Doing alright. L.A.‚Äôs weather beats Brooklyn‚Äôs any day.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre not here to swap stories,‚Äù Fox said, his voice soft, eyes narrowing.

‚ÄúNo, Mike, I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm here for Jimmy. Ann and I buried him today. I made promises‚Äîto her, to him‚Äîand I‚Äôve got three weeks to make good.‚Äù

‚ÄúMake good on what, Tom?‚Äù Fox leaned forward. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got this. A mugging gone bad, crowbar to the skull. Probably a junkie chasing a fix or kids after quick cash. Those cases can take months, years to crack.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on, Mike,‚Äù Tom said, his voice low, edged with cop-like grit. ‚ÄúYou know Jimmy played the horses‚Äîand was a lousy one. Ann swears he owed Carmine a grand. That‚Äôs a fortune to him. I talked to Carmine. He claims it was only a hundred and ate it out of his black heart‚Äôs kindness. One of ‚Äôem‚Äôs lying.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou think we‚Äôre slacking,‚Äù Fox said, bristling. ‚ÄúWe know Jimmy‚Äôs gambling. We‚Äôve got cops moonlighting security at Maimonides who talked. Carmine too. He said Jimmy always paid something. If it was him, he‚Äôd have broken Jimmy‚Äôs arm, not caved in his head.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow about the nurses?‚Äù Tom said, his voice rising, thick with grit. ‚ÄúYou know Jimmy‚ÄîTyrone Power looks, Errol Flynn charm. He was bedding two or three at a time, spinning lies about a future he‚Äôd never deliver. Or maybe a jealous husband. You checking that angle?‚Äù

‚ÄúTom, you‚Äôve got three weeks and a personal stake in this,‚Äù Mike said, leaning back in his chair. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not on your clock. We‚Äôve got other cases, and we‚Äôre professionals. You do it your way, we‚Äôll do it ours. 
Need anything, let me know.‚Äù

They swapped numbers and shook hands, the grip firm but wary. As Tom turned to leave, Mike offered one last tip.

‚ÄúMonsignor Coffey‚Äôs tight with the DA. He‚Äôs pushing us to close this fast‚Äîbad press for Regina Pacis‚Äôs Basilica bid. 
Talk to Father Luongo. He mentioned a woman in the apartment across the street, an eyewitness. We talked to her, but she claimed she was sleeping. Maybe she‚Äôll open up to you.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs her name?‚Äù Tom asked, his voice edged with grit.

‚ÄúLet Luongo tell you,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúAnd if she gives you anything solid, you let me know.‚Äù

Tom walked out with a single lead, thin but heavy. An eyewitness could break the case wide open. He headed back to Regina Pacis to face Monsignor Coffey and Father Luongo, knowing neither would roll over easy.

Tom rang the bell at the Regina Pacis rectory and was buzzed in. Vivian, the office manager, sat at the front desk, a gatekeeper deciding who sees whom, her eyes sharp as a hawk‚Äôs.

‚ÄúTom Hart, private investigator, hired by Jimmy Grillo‚Äôs widow,‚Äù he said, voice steady. ‚ÄúI need to see Father Luongo.‚Äù

‚ÄúFather Luongo‚Äôs off duty today. You can talk to Father Riley,‚Äù Vivian said, her tone stern, protective as a German shepherd.

‚ÄúIs he here?‚Äù Tom pressed, his eyes piercing with earnest grit. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs official business‚Äîa man‚Äôs murder, my friend. I won‚Äôt keep him long.‚Äù

Vivian sized him up. She‚Äôd been a WAC during the war, rigging parachutes in London for the Army Airborne, no patience for phonies. Tom‚Äôs blunt honesty, no bullshit, won her over. She dialed Father Luongo‚Äôs extension.

‚ÄúFather Luongo, someone‚Äôs here to see you. Seems important,‚Äù she said. Hanging up, she nodded. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôll be right down.‚Äù

Tom heard Father Luongo‚Äôs hurried steps descending from the rectory‚Äôs upstairs living quarters. The priest ushered him into a small office used for planning weddings and funerals, its air heavy with old incense and solemn promises.

‚ÄúFather Luongo, I‚Äôm Tom Hart, private investigator,‚Äù Tom said, flashing his PI badge as they shook hands. The priest stood short, about five-foot-five, jet-black hair slicked back, eyes sharp but kind.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking into my friend Jimmy Grillo‚Äôs murder for his widow, Ann,‚Äù Tom continued, his voice thick with grit. ‚ÄúShe and I are all he had left. I‚Äôll admit, it‚Äôs personal.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been talking to Detective Fox,‚Äù Father Luongo said, nodding. ‚ÄúThe woman‚Äôs name is Jenny Miscussa, a seventy-five-year-old spinster. She told me she saw the murder from her apartment window across the street. I urged her to tell the police‚Äîit‚Äôs her duty‚Äîbut she got cold feet, scared the killer might come for her.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a cop anymore,‚Äù Tom said. ‚ÄúIf I promise to keep it quiet, unofficial, she might open up.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think so too, Tom,‚Äù Father Luongo replied. ‚ÄúShe wants to do right, but fear‚Äôs got her tongue.‚Äù

Tom and Father Luongo stepped out of the office, only to find Monsignor Coffey seated beside Vivian at her desk, his eyes fixed on Tom, waiting.

‚ÄúHart, I need you in my office,‚Äù Coffey said, his tone more command than request.

‚ÄúHappy to oblige,‚Äù Tom shot back, his patience thinning at the Monsignor‚Äôs meddling.

Coffey settled behind a massive mahogany desk, every pen and paper in place, not a speck out of order. Tom sat in an armless chair facing him, feeling like a kid summoned to the principal‚Äôs office.

‚ÄúGoing forward, you speak to me, not my priests,‚Äù Coffey said, voice clipped. ‚ÄúUnderstood?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat are you scared of, Monsignor?‚Äù Tom asked, his tone sharp with grit. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm after justice for my friend‚Äôs murder. Thought you‚Äôd be more cooperative.‚Äù

‚ÄúAs a priest, justice matters to me,‚Äù Coffey said. ‚ÄúThe police are handling it. What I don‚Äôt need is a bull-in-a-china-shop PI stirring trouble, trouble that could derail my years-long dream for this parish and Regina Pacis‚Äôs Basilica bid.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy goal‚Äôs not to wreck your plans,‚Äù Tom said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm doing standard police work. Three weeks to crack this case, then I‚Äôm gone. Anything useful you can tell me?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know about Jenny Miscussa,‚Äù Coffey said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all we‚Äôve got. Good luck, Hart. I‚Äôd prefer you don‚Äôt come back unless it‚Äôs for Sunday Mass.‚Äù

Tom thanked him, voice tight, and walked out to his car. Back at his Bay Ridge hotel, he let a hot shower wash away the day‚Äôs weight. Jenny could wait until tomorrow. He‚Äôd done enough for now.

Chapter Four

Tom picked up Ann the next morning to grab breakfast before her shift. Ann was a looker‚Äîhad to be to hook a player like Jimmy into marriage. Medium height, long blonde hair, blue eyes that could stop traffic. Jimmy used to brag she looked like Lizabeth Scott, not a bad comparison for a Brooklyn gal.

At forty, she was a couple years older than Jimmy and at least fifteen years senior to that wiry kid at the funeral. Tom had rattled her yesterday at the diner, pressing about the lie‚Äîher grand versus Carmine‚Äôs hundred. He planned to use the same blunt approach to dig into the kid.

He‚Äôd called Ann the night before, telling her he‚Äôd be outside her place at seven. If Ann was anything, she was punctual, bouncing out of her house right on time.

‚ÄúMorning,‚Äù Tom said, stifling a yawn. ‚ÄúNever have to wait on you. I like that.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, Jimmy was the late one,‚Äù Ann said, settling into the car. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd start prodding him hours early just to show up ten minutes late.‚Äù It drew a laugh from both.

‚ÄúTrue,‚Äù Tom said, a smile tugging his lips. ‚ÄúOur wrestling coach at New Utrecht always put Jimmy‚Äôs matches last to make sure he‚Äôd show.‚Äù

He snagged a prime spot on 18th Avenue. Meters didn‚Äôt start ticking until nine, giving them plenty of time to talk.

Tom and Ann stepped into Roosevelt Restaurant, less a diner than a storefront with soul. The aroma of fresh coffee brewing and bacon sizzling on the grill wrapped you like a fog, clinging to your clothes long after you left.

Donny, the owner, waved them toward the back from behind the counter. ‚ÄúGot a few open seats,‚Äù he called.

They slid into a booth, the busboy wiping down the last crumbs. Two steaming cups of coffee landed first. Both ordered a stack of pancakes topped with scrambled eggs, served five minutes later by a waitress deftly balancing two heaping plates and smaller ones with toast in each hand.

‚ÄúGlad you‚Äôve got your appetite back, Ann,‚Äù Tom said, his voice steady. ‚ÄúEating keeps you grounded.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe pancake breakfast here‚Äôs the best,‚Äù Ann replied, cutting into her stack. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm feeling better today. Funerals wear you down. Sheila says I can take all the time I need at the parlor, but I‚Äôm ready to get back in the swing.‚Äù

‚ÄúToo much time on your hands isn‚Äôt healthy,‚Äù Tom said, sipping his coffee. ‚ÄúI need to stay busy, or I start turning molehills into mountains.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, did you find anything out at the precinct yesterday after dropping me off?‚Äù Ann asked.

‚ÄúMike was friendly enough, but he wasn‚Äôt exactly rolling out the red carpet,‚Äù Tom said. 
‚ÄúTold me they‚Äôre professionals, got it handled, don‚Äôt need my help.‚Äù

‚ÄúI was afraid of that,‚Äù Ann said, her voice soft. ‚ÄúLook, Tom, maybe he‚Äôs right. I feel bad keeping you here, working two weeks for free on a hopeless cause. This is costing you.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about it,‚Äù Tom said, his tone firm. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a big boy. I know what I‚Äôm doing. Got one lead, though. Some skinny kid I noticed in the back pew at Regina Pacis. Thought he was just praying. Then I saw him again at the cemetery, watching from behind a tree. Figured Carmine might‚Äôve sent him.‚Äù

Ann froze, her fork clattering to the plate. She‚Äôd hoped Tom wouldn‚Äôt notice, but she should‚Äôve known better.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not from Carmine,‚Äù she murmured, avoiding his eyes. ‚ÄúHis name‚Äôs Jerry. His father owns Marino‚Äôs Pizzeria next to the beauty parlor. He was there for me.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, anything going on besides an innocent show of support?‚Äù Tom asked, his voice cutting sharp.

Ann‚Äôs head snapped up, her eyes flashing, suddenly confrontational.

‚ÄúStop playing games, Tom. You‚Äôre a top-notch detective. You spotted him at the church and cemetery. You know it‚Äôs not just innocent,‚Äù she said, biting hard on the word.

‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôm sorry, Ann,‚Äù Tom said, softening. ‚ÄúI should‚Äôve been more tactful. I apologize. But you can‚Äôt hide things like this. If I‚Äôm asking, you know Mike will too when he finds out.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat makes you think he will?‚Äù she shot back.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think,‚Äù Tom said. ‚ÄúBut you can‚Äôt take that chance. If he asks, come clean, got me?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, I do,‚Äù Ann said, her voice steadying. ‚ÄúThanks for the advice. I promise, no more secrets.‚Äù

Ann paused, then continued.
‚ÄúTom, you know what it was like being married to Jimmy. Gorgeous man, couldn‚Äôt control himself. I shared him with half a dozen girls from day one. Too many nights alone while he was ‚Äòworking‚Äô at the hospital. I‚Äôm not stupid. I‚Äôve been seeing Jerry for about a year. He‚Äôs young, smitten, pays attention to me‚Äîsomething Jimmy stopped doing years ago. I loved Jimmy, but he took me for granted. You know what I mean.‚Äù

‚ÄúI do,‚Äù Tom said, his voice low. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I pushed you to spill that. But this gives Mike a motive‚Äînot for me, but for him. Just know that. No need to hide anything now; it‚Äôll only make you look suspicious. Wait for Mike to ask. Don‚Äôt volunteer. But if he does, be honest.‚Äù

‚ÄúI will,‚Äù Ann repeated. ‚ÄúReally, thank you, Tom. This isn‚Äôt easy.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs not, Ann. How could it be?‚Äù

Tom signaled for the check, his eyes lingering on her. Even in the dingy back booth of Roosevelt Restaurant, surrounded by the ordinary, Ann‚Äôs beauty stood out like a spotlight in the fog.
She had thirty minutes before her first nail appointment. 

Tom dropped her off at her house and headed back to his Bay Ridge hotel, steeling himself to visit Jenny Miscussa, the spinster with insomnia.

Tom‚Äôs mind drifted back to Ann as he drove from her place. If she had a hand in Jimmy‚Äôs murder, he‚Äôd let the police dig it up. He wouldn‚Äôt press her harder unless it was unavoidable. 

But he‚Äôd have to brace Jerry, the kid from the funeral. Mike would sniff him out soon enough, and Tom needed answers first. Ann and Jerry‚Äôs fling, tangled up with Jimmy‚Äôs wandering ways, was a mess‚Äîa dysfunctional knot that only muddied the case.
And knots like this had a way of strangling the truth.

I asked out my work crush in late July after I sensed that she was into me. In person she is very flirty, complimenting me, making me coffee and sharing her food with me, even more. But over text she is anti social, she said so herself.

Ive double texted before eg when I went to hospital last weekend to tell her that I will be slow at replying. She was very worried to make sure that I was okay


When I asked her out she said ""let's go on 2 dates"". She then canceled cause work and stuff. She said she doesnt want to mess me around but family stuff has come up. She has cancelled work shifts due to it. She didn't tell me specifically what the situation is but she has been very distant to everyone, ie not going to the work party. She specifically said it's not me.

So I'm used to the long wait times between replies but I checked in yesterday cause it was a full week since she texted me back, just to clarify and ask if she is okay, check if the date is still on and just explaining that I get very anxious and stuff. Quiet from her end but i do hope to see her on Saturday 

She reacted to my work message with a laugh, she doesn't do it to anyone else. Small but noticeable 

My friends and cousin told her to give her more space, we are working together on Saturday but based on recent track record she might cancel but I hope she doesn't.

I just feel that I sent her that message but I also want clarity to confirm if she still wants to date me or not. I'm not sure when she will reply but she will eventually.

The family situation plus she doesnt text much is probably a perfect storm. She tells me her work spams and she is really busy but has many times told me not to worry ",3,1757537657.0,AITA_Relationships,1,1.0,False

Chapter One

Tom Hart stepped off the plane into Brooklyn, the city hitting him like a fist to the jaw. It was his first time back since before the war, and he was here for the funeral of his pal Jimmy Grillo.

They‚Äôd grown up together in Bensonhurst, two kids on the corner of 66th and 17th, not bad but not saints either. They raised hell in their own small way‚Äîswiping candy from corner stores, sneaking beers, mouthing off to cops who didn‚Äôt care enough to chase them.

The worst was senior year, when a neighborhood thief named Poopoo slipped them ten bucks each to boost a car for a jewelry store heist. They pulled it off, hearts pounding, but it left a sour taste. 

That was right before graduation, before they enlisted in the Army to fight in WW2‚ÄîNormandy, bullets, and blood they never talked about, not then, not ever.

Now Jimmy was dead, his skull cracked open by a crowbar outside Regina Pacis Church at 11 p.m. Tom‚Äôs gut churned. Some debts you can‚Äôt bury, and he owed Jimmy this much: find the bastard who did it.

The cops called it a mugging gone wrong, a straightforward case. They figured the punk meant to knock Jimmy Grillo out, grab his wallet, and run, but adrenaline turned a crowbar swing into a skull-crushing blow that stole his life.

Jimmy worked the graveyard shift as a security guard at Maimonides Hospital. Wednesday was one of his two nights off, and he‚Äôd taken his shih tzu, Lucy, for a walk. Eleven p.m. was his usual hour, and Bensonhurst‚Äôs quiet streets were supposed to be safe. Murders didn‚Äôt happen here‚Äînot like this.

When the police rolled up to Regina Pacis Church, they found Jimmy sprawled on the pavement, head bashed in, barely clinging to life. Lucy huddled beside him, licking his hand, her small body trembling as if she could will him back.

Ann Grillo‚Äôs voice cracked over the phone, tears choking her words but fighting to stay steady. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs dead, Tom. They smashed his skull with a crowbar. Animals! They took him from me.‚Äù

Tom gripped the receiver, rage boiling under his skin. ‚ÄúDid they get the scumbags who did it?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Ann said, voice raw. ‚ÄúCops call it a mugging gone too far. But I think Carmine‚Äôs mixed up in it. Jimmy was betting, said he owed a grand. That‚Äôs big money for him, Tom. I think Carmine took it out in blood.‚Äù

Tom exhaled, steadying himself. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get through the funeral, Ann. Then I‚Äôll start asking around, sniff out what‚Äôs what. It‚Äôs been over twenty years since I left Brooklyn, but I still know the streets‚Äîand who talks.‚Äù

Tom Hart‚Äôs flight from L.A. touched down at LaGuardia at noon. He rented a sedan, tossed his bag in the trunk, and gunned it toward Ann‚Äôs place in Bensonhurst.

Dark clouds choked the New York sky, promising thunderstorms‚Äîa far cry from the sun-soaked L.A. streets he‚Äôd left behind. The weather mirrored his mood, heavy and brooding. 

Jimmy Grillo had problems, big ones. He drank too much, bet too much, spent too much, and fooled around with nurses on the night shift at Maimonides Hospital.

But he didn‚Äôt deserve a crowbar to the skull outside Regina Pacis Church. Ann should‚Äôve walked out years ago, but she stuck by him, always hoping he‚Äôd clean up. 

Tom and Jimmy had drifted to Christmas cards once a year. After the war, Jimmy came back to Brooklyn; Tom started fresh, joining the LAPD and marrying Elaine, now his ex-wife.

The force wore Tom down, so he retired early, trading his badge for a private investigator‚Äôs license. The divorce gutted him‚Äîpension slashed, alimony bleeding him dry‚Äîleaving no time to reconnect with old pals.

But Jimmy‚Äôs murder hit Tom like a slug to the chest, and he‚Äôd tear Brooklyn apart to find the one‚Äôs who did it.

Tom pulled up to Ann‚Äôs place, a cramped apartment in a four-family house on a worn-out Bensonhurst block. For five years, she and Jimmy had scraped by, always making rent, even if it meant skipping meals now and then.

Ann worked manicures at a beauty parlor a block away on 65th Street, her hands steady despite the life she‚Äôd been dealt. Jimmy‚Äôs insurance policy through Maimonides Hospital would cover the funeral and maybe square his debt with Carmine, the bookie who‚Äôd come sniffing for his grand.

Dead, Jimmy was providing better than he ever did alive. But it was unsustainable, and something had to break. A crowbar to the skull outside Regina Pacis Church, at the cost of his life‚Äîthat was too damn high.

‚ÄúTom, it‚Äôs good to see you,‚Äù Ann said, her voice breaking as she hugged him. ‚ÄúI only wish Jimmy was here.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know, Ann. It‚Äôs hard. The whole damn thing‚Äôs unbelievable,‚Äù Tom replied, his words heavy, like gravel in his throat.

‚ÄúI‚Äôd ask you to stay, but it‚Äôs a one-bedroom, and I‚Äôm afraid of what folks might think.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo problem. Got a room at a hotel in Bay Ridge. You‚Äôve got enough on your mind,‚Äù Tom said, his eyes scanning the cramped apartment, thick with grief.

‚ÄúThe funeral‚Äôs tomorrow at Regina Pacis, then straight to the cemetery for burial. Couldn‚Äôt afford a wake,‚Äù Ann said, her voice small.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre doing the best you can under the circumstances,‚Äù Tom said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll check into my room and see you at the church in the morning.‚Äù

‚ÄúRegina Pacis always brought me peace,‚Äù Ann said, eyes welling up. ‚ÄúNow I‚Äôll only see Jimmy lying there, skull smashed.‚Äù

‚ÄúGet some rest, Ann. I‚Äôll stick around after and find out what I can. I‚Äôll start digging right after the cemetery.‚Äù

Before checking into his Bay Ridge hotel, Tom swung by the old club on the corner of 17th Avenue, the hangout where he and Jimmy raised hell as kids. 

He left his .38 in the glove compartment and stepped inside, the air thick with cigar smoke and suspicion. He nodded at the bartender. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here for Carmine.‚Äù

A burly brute of a bodyguard loomed by a back room door, his gravelly voice like he‚Äôd been breathing cigars since the womb. ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs asking?‚Äù

‚ÄúHart. Tom Hart. Grew up down the block before I left for the war,‚Äù Tom said, holding his ground.

A slick-dressed man, about forty, handsome but sharp as a switchblade, waved Tom over from a corner table. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Carmine. What do you want?‚Äù he asked, his eyes piercing Tom‚Äôs like a blade.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm settling Jimmy Grillo‚Äôs debt. What‚Äôs he owe you?‚Äù

Carmine leaned back, sizing him up. ‚ÄúJimmy owed me a hundred before he got himself killed. Always paid on time, so forget it.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it?‚Äù Tom asked, startled, searching Carmine‚Äôs face for a lie.

‚ÄúYou deaf? It‚Äôs settled. Now get out before I change my mind,‚Äù Carmine snapped.

Tom hustled out, the club‚Äôs haze clinging to his coat. Someone was lying. Ann swore Jimmy owed Carmine a grand, but Carmine claimed a hundred, already forgiven. 

Maybe Jimmy fed Ann a story to pocket cash for his dames and dice. Or maybe Ann was hiding something. 

A random mugging? Tom wasn‚Äôt buying it‚Äînot with a crowbar splitting Jimmy‚Äôs skull outside Regina Pacis Church.

He checked into his hotel, grabbed a greasy diner burger, and chewed over the case. 

He‚Äôd wait until tomorrow‚Äôs funeral to tell Ann about Carmine, face-to-face. He needed to see her eyes when he dropped the news. If Jimmy wasn‚Äôt lying, she was.

And Tom Hart trusted only what he could see with his own eyes.

Chapter Two

Tom Hart was up early the morning of Jimmy Grillo‚Äôs funeral, the weight of the day heavy as a .38 in his hand. Ann had made arrangements at Aievoli Funeral Parlor on 12th Avenue, across from Regina Pacis Church.

The casket was closed; no viewing, but the family, essentially Ann and Tom, could say their goodbyes before it was carried to the church for the funeral mass, then to Greenwood Cemetery for burial.

Monsignor Coffey himself was leading the mass, his jaw tight over the publicity tainting his church. He was pushing to have Regina Pacis named a Basilica, and a murder on its steps wasn‚Äôt helping. 

The papers, hungry for ink, dubbed it ‚ÄúThe Skull Crowbar Murder,‚Äù splashing Jimmy‚Äôs name across headlines. Some yellow journalists even spun tales of a fling between Jimmy and a young nun from the convent, anything to sell copies.

Tom Hart sat in his Bay Ridge hotel room, jotting down names of people tied to Jimmy Grillo‚Äôs murder‚Äînot suspects yet, but players who might know something worth hearing.

First on his list, right after the burial, was Homicide Detective Mike Fox at the 69th Precinct. Mike was a neighborhood guy, a high school acquaintance of Tom and Jimmy‚Äôs, not quite a friend but close enough to share a past on the wrestling team, scrapping in the same sweaty gym.

He also needed to face Ann about Carmine. If Jimmy‚Äôs debt was really a grand, like Ann claimed, Carmine‚Äôs quick dismissal of a hundred bucks could be a dodge to keep the cops off his back. Leaning on a grieving widow for her dead husband‚Äôs gambling debts‚Äîespecially if Carmine swung the crowbar‚Äîwould draw too much heat.

But first, Mike. Tom needed whatever the detective knew, anything to explain why a crowbar cracked Jimmy‚Äôs skull outside Regina Pacis Church.

Tom parked in Aievoli‚Äôs lot at eight sharp, the first to arrive. He took a front-row seat in the viewing room, his eyes locked on Jimmy Grillo‚Äôs closed casket, the weight of the moment heavier than his .38.

He was piecing together what he had. Carmine was the easy suspect, but Tom‚Äôs years on the force taught him the obvious rarely held up. Then there was Ann, the widow. Much as he wanted to believe her clean, he‚Äôd be a lousy PI if he didn‚Äôt consider her. A thousand bucks, she‚Äôd said‚Äîyet Carmine claimed a hundred, already forgiven. Someone was lying.

He‚Äôd need to hit Maimonides Hospital, where Jimmy worked security, to grill his bosses and coworkers. Anything‚Äîa grudge, a debt, a jealous nurse‚Äîcould fit the puzzle of a crowbar splitting Jimmy‚Äôs skull.

Then there were Monsignor Coffey and the priests at Regina Pacis. The murder went down on their doorstep. Did they see something and hold back, protecting their church‚Äôs bid for Basilica status?

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see,‚Äù Tom muttered to Jimmy‚Äôs coffin, a vow to leave no stone unturned.

Ann walked into Aievoli‚Äôs viewing room, dressed in a black top and slacks‚Äîno black dress in her closet, but grief didn‚Äôt care about wardrobe. 

She knelt before Jimmy‚Äôs closed casket, crossing herself, her whispered Hail Mary carrying a promise to Jimmy: she was here with Tom, and everything would be alright.

She sank into the pew beside Tom, and he gave her hand a gentle squeeze, his eyes hard but steady. Four women from the beauty parlor on 65th Street, where Ann worked, slipped in to pay respects before their shift, their heels clicking softly on the floor.

The funeral director stepped in, voice low, directing everyone to say their goodbyes. The casket would soon head across 65th Street to Regina Pacis for the mass, then to Greenwood Cemetery for burial.

Outside, the early fall day was partly cloudy, a cool breeze cutting through Brooklyn‚Äôs heavy air. Tom and Ann crossed toward Regina Pacis, dipping fingers in holy water as they entered, the faint scent of incense lingering from the 7 a.m. mass. They genuflected and took the front pew, the only family there. 

The four beauty parlor women sat five rows back, while seven of Jimmy‚Äôs coworkers from Maimonides Hospital‚Äôs overnight shift scattered across the first three rows‚Äîtwo nurses among them, maybe too ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù with Jimmy.

At nine o‚Äôclock, a bell rang, sharp like a Good Humor cart‚Äôs chime. The congregation rose, and Monsignor Coffey emerged from the sacristy, his face stern. 

Five reporters from the Daily News, New York Post, and local tabloids hovered, snapping photos of Ann as she entered. She ducked her head, dodging their lenses.

Monsignor delivered a stirring mass, his homily painting Jimmy as a devoted husband, friend, and coworker‚Äîa good man, crowbar or not. 

He glared at the press, demanding respect for Ann‚Äôs grief, his voice carrying the weight of a man protecting his church‚Äôs bid for Basilica status.

After communion, the congregation filed out, Monsignor trailing the hearse to Greenwood Cemetery alongside Tom and Ann. The reporters tagged along, relentless. Monsignor, a stout, imposing figure, barked at them to do their jobs but offered no comment, his role strictly pastoral.

Tom shot hard stares at anyone who dared approach Ann, his policeman grit promising trouble. The vultures kept their distance.

Monsignor Coffey stood over the coffin at Greenwood Cemetery, splashing holy water and reciting the funeral liturgy, his voice steady against the fall breeze. The sparse, intimate ceremony was one Jimmy would‚Äôve nodded approval at, simple and honest.

When it ended, the funeral director handed Ann and Tom roses to lay on the casket before they turned away. Tom‚Äôs eyes caught a skinny, wiry kid, about twenty-five, in a white tee with a pack of Marlboros rolled in his sleeve, leaning against a tree a dozen yards off, keeping his distance.

Tom had clocked him earlier, slouched in the last pew by Regina Pacis‚Äôs front door during the mass. At first, he figured the kid was there for a personal prayer, not the funeral. Now it was clear‚Äîhe was watching.

As Tom and Ann headed to the car, he caught the faintest glance and smile flicker between her and the kid. Tom‚Äôs gut tightened. Something was brewing between them, something he needed to unravel.

Tom took Ann to the Americana  Diner on 65th Street for brunch after the burial, settling into a booth in the back room, the one with cracked vinyl seats and no frills. 

He ordered a western omelet with toast and home fries. Ann wasn‚Äôt hungry, her eyes hollow. Tom nudged her to eat, and she settled for a soft-boiled egg, toast, and black coffee.

‚ÄúGlad you‚Äôre eating something,‚Äù Tom said, his voice low. ‚ÄúLast thing you need is to make yourself sick now.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right,‚Äù Ann replied, staring at her plate. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just glad it‚Äôs over. I‚Äôll grab the death certificates from the funeral parlor and head home. It‚Äôs hitting me hard, Tom‚Äîknowing he‚Äôs really gone.‚Äù

Tom leaned forward, his gaze steady. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got good news. You don‚Äôt have to worry about Carmine. I saw him yesterday. He said Jimmy owed him a hundred bucks, not a grand, and he‚Äôs eating it under the circumstances. But here‚Äôs the thing, Ann‚Äîhe said a hundred, you said a thousand. Someone‚Äôs lying.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt me, Tom,‚Äù she shot back, her voice sharp. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd never lie to you, especially not now.‚Äù

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt mean you,‚Äù Tom said, easing back. ‚ÄúJimmy might‚Äôve fed you a story about the money.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh,‚Äù Ann said, her shoulders loosening, but her eyes flickered. ‚ÄúI should‚Äôve known that‚Äôs what you meant. I‚Äôm just wound up, is all.‚Äù

Tom paid the check and dropped her off at Aievoli‚Äôs to finish her business. Her quick defense gnawed at him, like she was hiding more than grief. 

Jimmy was likely the liar, pocketing cash for his dames or dice, but Ann‚Äôs reaction‚Äîand that wiry kid in the white tee at the cemetery‚Äîkept Tom‚Äôs instincts on edge.

He let it go for now. Two weeks, three at most, before he had to head back to L.A. to make a living. That wasn‚Äôt much time to crack a murder case, and he had a long list of people to shake down for answers.

Chapter Three

Tom climbed the steps of the 69th Precinct on 16th Avenue, a memory flickering like a worn-out film reel. 

He and Jimmy, hauled in by Officer Beales for disorderly conduct, kids mouthing off on the corner of 17th Avenue. Beales had barked at them twice to scatter. 

They‚Äôd shuffle off, only to slink back once his patrol car vanished.
The third time, three squad cars screeched up, sirens howling like they were nabbing Al Capone. Beales dragged their crew to the precinct, parents called, lectures delivered. Tom‚Äôs lips twitched with wry nostalgia.

But the past faded fast. This wasn‚Äôt about kids defying a surly cop. Jimmy‚Äôs skull was cracked open outside Regina Pacis Church, and Tom had a murder to unravel.

Stepping into the 69th Precinct on 16th Avenue, Tom felt nostalgia surge. The place was frozen in time: same metal desks and chairs, caked with ten layers of chipped paint; same holding cage with a flimsy lock begging to be busted; same faded ‚ÄúCop of the Month‚Äù photo framed on the wall, mocking the room‚Äôs grit.

At the main desk, centered like a judge‚Äôs bench, Tom blinked, half-convinced he was seeing ghosts. Officer Beales‚Äînow Sergeant Beales‚Äîsat barking orders, chewing out a DWI suspect with the same scowl he‚Äôd worn hauling Tom and Jimmy in as kids.

Tom wasn‚Äôt here to swap old stories. He caught a female officer‚Äôs eye. ‚ÄúDetective Fox?‚Äù She pointed to an office down the hall.

Tom stepped in, leaning against the doorframe. ‚ÄúMike, remember me? Tom Hart. Last time I saw you, I had you in a full nelson.‚Äù

Mike Fox looked up, a grin cracking his weathered face. ‚ÄúTom? Hell, it‚Äôs been twenty-five years. Heard you were on the job in L.A. How‚Äôs it treating you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI left the LAPD five years back,‚Äù Tom said, leaning back in Mike Fox‚Äôs cluttered office. ‚ÄúStarted my own PI shop. Doing alright. L.A.‚Äôs weather beats Brooklyn‚Äôs any day.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre not here to swap stories,‚Äù Fox said, his voice soft, eyes narrowing.

‚ÄúNo, Mike, I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm here for Jimmy. Ann and I buried him today. I made promises‚Äîto her, to him‚Äîand I‚Äôve got three weeks to make good.‚Äù

‚ÄúMake good on what, Tom?‚Äù Fox leaned forward. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got this. A mugging gone bad, crowbar to the skull. Probably a junkie chasing a fix or kids after quick cash. Those cases can take months, years to crack.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on, Mike,‚Äù Tom said, his voice low, edged with cop-like grit. ‚ÄúYou know Jimmy played the horses‚Äîand was a lousy one. Ann swears he owed Carmine a grand. That‚Äôs a fortune to him. I talked to Carmine. He claims it was only a hundred and ate it out of his black heart‚Äôs kindness. One of ‚Äôem‚Äôs lying.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou think we‚Äôre slacking,‚Äù Fox said, bristling. ‚ÄúWe know Jimmy‚Äôs gambling. We‚Äôve got cops moonlighting security at Maimonides who talked. Carmine too. He said Jimmy always paid something. If it was him, he‚Äôd have broken Jimmy‚Äôs arm, not caved in his head.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow about the nurses?‚Äù Tom said, his voice rising, thick with grit. ‚ÄúYou know Jimmy‚ÄîTyrone Power looks, Errol Flynn charm. He was bedding two or three at a time, spinning lies about a future he‚Äôd never deliver. Or maybe a jealous husband. You checking that angle?‚Äù

‚ÄúTom, you‚Äôve got three weeks and a personal stake in this,‚Äù Mike said, leaning back in his chair. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not on your clock. We‚Äôve got other cases, and we‚Äôre professionals. You do it your way, we‚Äôll do it ours. 
Need anything, let me know.‚Äù

They swapped numbers and shook hands, the grip firm but wary. As Tom turned to leave, Mike offered one last tip.

‚ÄúMonsignor Coffey‚Äôs tight with the DA. He‚Äôs pushing us to close this fast‚Äîbad press for Regina Pacis‚Äôs Basilica bid. 
Talk to Father Luongo. He mentioned a woman in the apartment across the street, an eyewitness. We talked to her, but she claimed she was sleeping. Maybe she‚Äôll open up to you.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs her name?‚Äù Tom asked, his voice edged with grit.

‚ÄúLet Luongo tell you,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúAnd if she gives you anything solid, you let me know.‚Äù

Tom walked out with a single lead, thin but heavy. An eyewitness could break the case wide open. He headed back to Regina Pacis to face Monsignor Coffey and Father Luongo, knowing neither would roll over easy.

Tom rang the bell at the Regina Pacis rectory and was buzzed in. Vivian, the office manager, sat at the front desk, a gatekeeper deciding who sees whom, her eyes sharp as a hawk‚Äôs.

‚ÄúTom Hart, private investigator, hired by Jimmy Grillo‚Äôs widow,‚Äù he said, voice steady. ‚ÄúI need to see Father Luongo.‚Äù

‚ÄúFather Luongo‚Äôs off duty today. You can talk to Father Riley,‚Äù Vivian said, her tone stern, protective as a German shepherd.

‚ÄúIs he here?‚Äù Tom pressed, his eyes piercing with earnest grit. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs official business‚Äîa man‚Äôs murder, my friend. I won‚Äôt keep him long.‚Äù

Vivian sized him up. She‚Äôd been a WAC during the war, rigging parachutes in London for the Army Airborne, no patience for phonies. Tom‚Äôs blunt honesty, no bullshit, won her over. She dialed Father Luongo‚Äôs extension.

‚ÄúFather Luongo, someone‚Äôs here to see you. Seems important,‚Äù she said. Hanging up, she nodded. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôll be right down.‚Äù

Tom heard Father Luongo‚Äôs hurried steps descending from the rectory‚Äôs upstairs living quarters. The priest ushered him into a small office used for planning weddings and funerals, its air heavy with old incense and solemn promises.

‚ÄúFather Luongo, I‚Äôm Tom Hart, private investigator,‚Äù Tom said, flashing his PI badge as they shook hands. The priest stood short, about five-foot-five, jet-black hair slicked back, eyes sharp but kind.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking into my friend Jimmy Grillo‚Äôs murder for his widow, Ann,‚Äù Tom continued, his voice thick with grit. ‚ÄúShe and I are all he had left. I‚Äôll admit, it‚Äôs personal.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been talking to Detective Fox,‚Äù Father Luongo said, nodding. ‚ÄúThe woman‚Äôs name is Jenny Miscussa, a seventy-five-year-old spinster. She told me she saw the murder from her apartment window across the street. I urged her to tell the police‚Äîit‚Äôs her duty‚Äîbut she got cold feet, scared the killer might come for her.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a cop anymore,‚Äù Tom said. ‚ÄúIf I promise to keep it quiet, unofficial, she might open up.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think so too, Tom,‚Äù Father Luongo replied. ‚ÄúShe wants to do right, but fear‚Äôs got her tongue.‚Äù

Tom and Father Luongo stepped out of the office, only to find Monsignor Coffey seated beside Vivian at her desk, his eyes fixed on Tom, waiting.

‚ÄúHart, I need you in my office,‚Äù Coffey said, his tone more command than request.

‚ÄúHappy to oblige,‚Äù Tom shot back, his patience thinning at the Monsignor‚Äôs meddling.

Coffey settled behind a massive mahogany desk, every pen and paper in place, not a speck out of order. Tom sat in an armless chair facing him, feeling like a kid summoned to the principal‚Äôs office.

‚ÄúGoing forward, you speak to me, not my priests,‚Äù Coffey said, voice clipped. ‚ÄúUnderstood?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat are you scared of, Monsignor?‚Äù Tom asked, his tone sharp with grit. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm after justice for my friend‚Äôs murder. Thought you‚Äôd be more cooperative.‚Äù

‚ÄúAs a priest, justice matters to me,‚Äù Coffey said. ‚ÄúThe police are handling it. What I don‚Äôt need is a bull-in-a-china-shop PI stirring trouble, trouble that could derail my years-long dream for this parish and Regina Pacis‚Äôs Basilica bid.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy goal‚Äôs not to wreck your plans,‚Äù Tom said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm doing standard police work. Three weeks to crack this case, then I‚Äôm gone. Anything useful you can tell me?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know about Jenny Miscussa,‚Äù Coffey said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all we‚Äôve got. Good luck, Hart. I‚Äôd prefer you don‚Äôt come back unless it‚Äôs for Sunday Mass.‚Äù

Tom thanked him, voice tight, and walked out to his car. Back at his Bay Ridge hotel, he let a hot shower wash away the day‚Äôs weight. Jenny could wait until tomorrow. He‚Äôd done enough for now.

Chapter Four

Tom picked up Ann the next morning to grab breakfast before her shift. Ann was a looker‚Äîhad to be to hook a player like Jimmy into marriage. Medium height, long blonde hair, blue eyes that could stop traffic. Jimmy used to brag she looked like Lizabeth Scott, not a bad comparison for a Brooklyn gal.

At forty, she was a couple years older than Jimmy and at least fifteen years senior to that wiry kid at the funeral. Tom had rattled her yesterday at the diner, pressing about the lie‚Äîher grand versus Carmine‚Äôs hundred. He planned to use the same blunt approach to dig into the kid.

He‚Äôd called Ann the night before, telling her he‚Äôd be outside her place at seven. If Ann was anything, she was punctual, bouncing out of her house right on time.

‚ÄúMorning,‚Äù Tom said, stifling a yawn. ‚ÄúNever have to wait on you. I like that.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, Jimmy was the late one,‚Äù Ann said, settling into the car. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd start prodding him hours early just to show up ten minutes late.‚Äù It drew a laugh from both.

‚ÄúTrue,‚Äù Tom said, a smile tugging his lips. ‚ÄúOur wrestling coach at New Utrecht always put Jimmy‚Äôs matches last to make sure he‚Äôd show.‚Äù

He snagged a prime spot on 18th Avenue. Meters didn‚Äôt start ticking until nine, giving them plenty of time to talk.

Tom and Ann stepped into Roosevelt Restaurant, less a diner than a storefront with soul. The aroma of fresh coffee brewing and bacon sizzling on the grill wrapped you like a fog, clinging to your clothes long after you left.

Donny, the owner, waved them toward the back from behind the counter. ‚ÄúGot a few open seats,‚Äù he called.

They slid into a booth, the busboy wiping down the last crumbs. Two steaming cups of coffee landed first. Both ordered a stack of pancakes topped with scrambled eggs, served five minutes later by a waitress deftly balancing two heaping plates and smaller ones with toast in each hand.

‚ÄúGlad you‚Äôve got your appetite back, Ann,‚Äù Tom said, his voice steady. ‚ÄúEating keeps you grounded.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe pancake breakfast here‚Äôs the best,‚Äù Ann replied, cutting into her stack. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm feeling better today. Funerals wear you down. Sheila says I can take all the time I need at the parlor, but I‚Äôm ready to get back in the swing.‚Äù

‚ÄúToo much time on your hands isn‚Äôt healthy,‚Äù Tom said, sipping his coffee. ‚ÄúI need to stay busy, or I start turning molehills into mountains.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, did you find anything out at the precinct yesterday after dropping me off?‚Äù Ann asked.

‚ÄúMike was friendly enough, but he wasn‚Äôt exactly rolling out the red carpet,‚Äù Tom said. 
‚ÄúTold me they‚Äôre professionals, got it handled, don‚Äôt need my help.‚Äù

‚ÄúI was afraid of that,‚Äù Ann said, her voice soft. ‚ÄúLook, Tom, maybe he‚Äôs right. I feel bad keeping you here, working two weeks for free on a hopeless cause. This is costing you.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about it,‚Äù Tom said, his tone firm. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a big boy. I know what I‚Äôm doing. Got one lead, though. Some skinny kid I noticed in the back pew at Regina Pacis. Thought he was just praying. Then I saw him again at the cemetery, watching from behind a tree. Figured Carmine might‚Äôve sent him.‚Äù

Ann froze, her fork clattering to the plate. She‚Äôd hoped Tom wouldn‚Äôt notice, but she should‚Äôve known better.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not from Carmine,‚Äù she murmured, avoiding his eyes. ‚ÄúHis name‚Äôs Jerry. His father owns Marino‚Äôs Pizzeria next to the beauty parlor. He was there for me.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, anything going on besides an innocent show of support?‚Äù Tom asked, his voice cutting sharp.

Ann‚Äôs head snapped up, her eyes flashing, suddenly confrontational.

‚ÄúStop playing games, Tom. You‚Äôre a top-notch detective. You spotted him at the church and cemetery. You know it‚Äôs not just innocent,‚Äù she said, biting hard on the word.

‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôm sorry, Ann,‚Äù Tom said, softening. ‚ÄúI should‚Äôve been more tactful. I apologize. But you can‚Äôt hide things like this. If I‚Äôm asking, you know Mike will too when he finds out.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat makes you think he will?‚Äù she shot back.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think,‚Äù Tom said. ‚ÄúBut you can‚Äôt take that chance. If he asks, come clean, got me?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, I do,‚Äù Ann said, her voice steadying. ‚ÄúThanks for the advice. I promise, no more secrets.‚Äù

Ann paused, then continued.
‚ÄúTom, you know what it was like being married to Jimmy. Gorgeous man, couldn‚Äôt control himself. I shared him with half a dozen girls from day one. Too many nights alone while he was ‚Äòworking‚Äô at the hospital. I‚Äôm not stupid. I‚Äôve been seeing Jerry for about a year. He‚Äôs young, smitten, pays attention to me‚Äîsomething Jimmy stopped doing years ago. I loved Jimmy, but he took me for granted. You know what I mean.‚Äù

‚ÄúI do,‚Äù Tom said, his voice low. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I pushed you to spill that. But this gives Mike a motive‚Äînot for me, but for him. Just know that. No need to hide anything now; it‚Äôll only make you look suspicious. Wait for Mike to ask. Don‚Äôt volunteer. But if he does, be honest.‚Äù

‚ÄúI will,‚Äù Ann repeated. ‚ÄúReally, thank you, Tom. This isn‚Äôt easy.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs not, Ann. How could it be?‚Äù

Tom signaled for the check, his eyes lingering on her. Even in the dingy back booth of Roosevelt Restaurant, surrounded by the ordinary, Ann‚Äôs beauty stood out like a spotlight in the fog.
She had thirty minutes before her first nail appointment. 

Tom dropped her off at her house and headed back to his Bay Ridge hotel, steeling himself to visit Jenny Miscussa, the spinster with insomnia.

Tom‚Äôs mind drifted back to Ann as he drove from her place. If she had a hand in Jimmy‚Äôs murder, he‚Äôd let the police dig it up. He wouldn‚Äôt press her harder unless it was unavoidable. 

But he‚Äôd have to brace Jerry, the kid from the funeral. Mike would sniff him out soon enough, and Tom needed answers first. Ann and Jerry‚Äôs fling, tangled up with Jimmy‚Äôs wandering ways, was a mess‚Äîa dysfunctional knot that only muddied the case.
And knots like this had a way of strangling the truth.

Example, various sources say lavender is bad for cats but essential oils for it are safe. So I'm just???

I wanted to know which scents are okay for cats. Because my mom and my aunt started putting out the diffuser out now that the weather is all over the place (scorching heat + storms left and right, making the smell around the house smell either like sewage from the drains outside or whatever smell that crops up from the terrible humidity) and even if my litter is good even has a strong coffee smell, daily changes, has baking soda to stop the smell etc., it's still smells a bit because my cats love drinking water so it gets used up fast and the other one is still bit dumb on how to properly bury his poo and makes his brother do it instead.

I wanted to know which scents are okay for cats. I know scents are strong for them and often can become irritating, that's a given but I have to compromise with my family since the smell is getting a bit much for them. They had turned the diffuser open one time and my cats didn't care but I didn't know what scent they used and I want to be extra sure and want them to be safe at least even if it makes me sound like a helicopter parent to my family.

I'm terrible at telling personal experiences, but to get where i'm coming from i'll try my best. I'll have to get detailed about it tho, sorry in advance for the long story.

I've worked at a thrift store as a cashier for 1,5-2 yrs now and was fired a few months ago; due to a personal medical reason which made it hard to do my job.

When i worked there for only a few months i had to deal with shitty customers every now and then, but the one that i'm gonna talk about was smth else! It's the type where you could tell straight from the bat that something wasn't right in the head.

The first time i had to help him out he immediately tried to strike up conversation. Asking me about my hobbies which in itself is pretty innocent, but it was the way he was smiling at me at times which made it obvious he was a creep. 

He also ordered a cup of coffee with toast. Once it was ready the toast should be cut in half and stacked on top of eachother so it'll look more neat, but due to the weight of the sandwich maker it was flat which made it looks like just one sandwich.

I served it to him and he asked me where the other half is, i explained to him that both halves were on the plate and went back to the cash register. The whole time that customers were coming up to me to pay for whatever they thrifted, you could hear him get louder and louder. Asking where the other half was and complaining about it. He got so worked up that he pulled another customer into his little riot! 

He eventually came up to me together with the other customer and they were both steaming mad about ""the other half""! 
Saying that it wasn't customer service and that he's been waiting forever, he got so mad that other colleagues got pulled from the back just to see what's going on. Just for him to pull the two pieces apart and act surprised about it, are you kidding me?!!

After he was done eating he apologized and said  i was a cute girl and wanted to ""make it up to me"". He even used my hobbies to flirt with me, saying he knows a place where i can play the drums. He couldn't get further than that tho, since i acted ditzy and dumb about his intentions. He eventually left.

The next time i ran into him was in the city.
I happened to pass him by, but didn't notice him calling out to me since i had headphones on. You'd think that'd be the end of it, but NO THIS MAN FOLLOWED ME DOWN THE STREET JUST TO TALK TO ME!
He disguised it as an innocent convo at first, but it didn't sit right with me. Eventually he brought up that the girl he was at the thrift store with was just a friend and that he ""isn't  really into relationships"" followed by him trying to ask me out and trying to invite himself to walk with me.

I made up some lie to get him off my back which worked.

Yesterday was the 2nd time i've ran into him. I tend to ignore everyone and everything around me so i didn't even notice it was him in the first place.
Only when he started following me down the street i took notice of him and he tried to strike up a conversation again.
I would've easily kept walking if i didn't know this man is mentally unstable so i felt i had to keep talking to him to appease him.

He asked why he didn't see me at work anymore and asked where i lived as well, so i made up some lies mentioning i lived with a (girl)friend. Just for him to ask if i was gay, why would that even matter to him? 
Furthermore, he noticed my wrist braces and said that a nice girl like me shouldn't wear anything like that and he kept staring at me and basically holding me hostage by talking to me.

I eventually cut him off, telling him i was in a rush and i bolted out of there.

Anyone that has been in the same situation, please tell me how you talked yourself out of it; cuz this is just getting weird to me.
I felt so uncomfortable and paranoid afterwards too.",3,1757537348.0,TwoXChromosomes,2,0.8,False

1ndpt7x,https://i.redd.it/nhb4gv8dgeof1.jpeg,Katy should be dropped from Trend Management,"At first, I thought Katy had a cubby here, but realized it was actually Katy Harrell who seems to be much better at her job.

Katy still being managed by Trend is mind blowing to me since they manage SO many influencers who are literally a million times better than Katy. She should be so lucky to even be invited to LTKCon this year (if she even was invited). I travel a lot for work and to many conferences and the thought and detail LTK puts into their events is like nothing I have ever seen. It is very reminiscent of celebrity gifting suites. I mean, I guess influencers are the new celebrities, but they are absolutely treated like royalty. Free designer clothing, jewelry, perfume, shoes, and I‚Äôve seen Trend and Bloomingdale‚Äôs delivering customized coffee and skin care to everyone‚Äôs rooms. I mean, how lucky are these people?!? 

To purposely miss out on something like this, the networking, and the education (that Katy very badly needs) is 100% psychotic. Most of these women have multiple children and they still attend these work events. They should not be optional, just like it isn‚Äôt optional for me to travel for work. Katy needs to be dropped from Trend ASAP since she is not representative of their culture or the goals of influencers. You can‚Äôt even call Katy an influencer because nothing she does or shows is influential in any way. She is simply a shiller of clothing with a seemingly 5th grade education.",7,1757537174.0,LivingMyBestSnark,1,1.0,False
1ndpt3z,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegas/comments/1ndpt3z/3_days_in_vegas_september_2025/,3 days in Vegas September 2025,"(If you hate trip reports, just move along.)

Spouse and I (both 50-something) spent a long weekend in Vegas September 5-8. It was our first visit in many years -- me in about 10 years (for a conference), spouse in about 30. Needless to say, the Strip is a completely different place than it was last time he visited. This was a quick getaway to celebrate an anniversary. We like good food and drink, but are not really gamblers, so the restaurants and bars were the big draw for us. We also saw a couple of shows.

Things we loved (not in chronological order):

* Our stay at the Palazzo. Beautiful, comfortable room, decent view (we were about halfway up the tower directly across the Strip from TI, could look south toward Caesars Palace, and had a great view of the mountains to the west). We arrived about 10 AM Friday morning, and after using mobile check-in, got a text during the cab ride from the airport to say our room was ready. We got our keys at the kiosk, no wait, and went directly to our room to settle in and take a short nap (after rising at 5:30 to get to the airport). Perfect.
* Dita Von Teese's show. Gorgeous, artful, funny, sexy -- just a glorious entertainment from start to finish. The dancers (women, men, and of course Dita herself) were beautiful, expressive, and obviously wildly talented. The Art Deco-ish Voltaire theater was also a perfect jewel box of a venue. Probably our favorite single activity during the trip.
* The tasting menu at Jaleo. We left stuffed to the gills after a bunch of delicious courses paired with really interesting wines, and were sent on our way with walking G&T's. Service was fabulous. This was a raging bargain for the price ($200/person). Highly recommended if you like Spanish food, tasting menus, or both.
* Cocktails at Hard Shake in the Waldorf Astoria. A classy, beautiful space with spectacular strip views to the north and south, with excellent cocktails and snacks. I mentioned our anniversary when I made the reservation, and we were served surprise bonus champagne.
* The Verbena at the Chandelier Bar. Wow wow wow. We both loved this drink (and the whole Cosmo vibe). If/when we return, we may well stay at the Cosmo.
* Sunday brunch at Bouchon. Amazing pastries (including a fig and goat cheese danish that was to die for) and perfectly mixed Corpse Reviver #2 cocktails.
* Sunday evening cocktails and snacks at the Petrossian Bar in the Bellagio. Probably the best Old Fashioned I've ever had, surrounded by the controlled chaos of the Bellagio lobby and casino. A++ people watching, A++ service.

Things we liked very much:

* Absinthe. The comedy was funny, the acrobatics were jaw-dropping. We really enjoyed it. We saw this on Sunday evening, and we'd probably have loved it more if we hadn't just seen DVT the night before (the shows aren't really directly comparable, but DVT was so good and still in our heads). 
* Pink Jeep Hoover Dam tour. Despite the fact that we had to get up early on Saturday morning to do this after an overindulgent Friday night, it was worth it, especially since we didn't have to drive ourselves. Neither of us had ever been to Hoover Dam before, so this was a very enjoyable morning.
* Hanging by the Bellagio fountain on Friday night after dinner at Jaleo with our walking G&T's in hand. A classic Vegas Strip experience shared with a group of cheerful strangers obviously from diverse walks of life, but all in party mode. Not a lot of places in this world to do that.
* The casino floor vibes at both Venetian and Palazzo. Most of the time we were there, both casinos were jumping, but especially Friday-Saturday night. We gambled a little bit here and there and came out a couple hundred bucks ahead between slots and video poker.
* Peking duck at Mott 32. This was our ""official"" anniversary dinner, and the food was excellent. The rest of the experience was not as good as it might have been because our server was pretty disorganized and didn't really help our meal flow smoothly. 
* All of our other food/drink experiences at V/P, including Brera Osteria, Scarr's Pizza, All'Antico Vinaio, Donutique, and the Close Company speakeasy. Great food all around. Shout out to the bartender at Close Company, who made some of the more memorable drinks on a trip that was full of great cocktails. 

Other stuff:

* The smoking in the casinos really feels like an unwelcome throwback. As nonsmokers, we found it mostly tolerable (clearly the ventilation systems are great), but it left my throat a little raw and my clothes a little smoky. Not my favorite. Also, the weed smoke on the Strip itself is no joke. I expected that from reading this sub, but whew, contact highs abound.
* Staying at V/P while the Eagles were playing the Sphere meant there were so many boomers in Eagles t-shirts. There were also a lot of Wizard of Oz fans about, which made for an interesting mix. Almost everyone seemed in high spirits and having a good time, though.
* We brought a collapsible electric kettle and coffee packets/tea bags so we could get morning caffeine without leaving our room. This was ideal, and I wouldn't have thought to do it without reading this sub to prep for the trip. (Yes, it would be nice if there was a coffeemaker in the room, but honestly, my instant coffee was better coffee than I've ever gotten out of most hotel room coffeemakers, so no real complaint.)
* Service overall was just impeccable, with the only exception being our distracted/disorganized server at Mott 32. We felt really well taken care of literally everywhere else. Great job, Vegas.
* As mostly non-gamblers with no comps, we didn't expect this to be a cheap trip, and we clearly weren't trying to do Vegas on the cheap. And for sure, food/drink prices are pretty high, but prices are similar in lots of big cities and tourist destinations. It didn't seem ridiculously out of line, especially considering that inflation in food prices from the last few years is hitting restaurants, too. Our total trip expenses were about 5K, including flights, hotel, meals, drinks, shows, and gambling.
* We'll be back. We had a lot of fun, and enjoyed the whole vibe of the place a lot more than we thought we might. There's something pretty special about the way Vegas just throws everyone together. Most people are friendly and really determined to have a good time. You can't feel out of place. We've done a lot of traveling, so we know that doesn't happen most places. It's pretty great.",6,1757537168.0,vegas,1,1.0,False

1ndprs0,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ndprs0/eternal_sunshine_of_the_spotless_mind_is/,Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is strangely a comfort movie for me,"There's something about this movie I find so comforting and I can't put my finger on it.

I know everyone analyzes the meaning behind the story but for me, my fixation is more on the mood and the characters.

The way it portrays the main character as this shy, dopey guy who's kind of listless and depressed, wandering around with the new england aesthetic and the sunny cold winter morning. It's something I can wrap myself up in like a blanket.

Growing up I was always really shy and lost and this was the first movie I saw that almost romanticized this personality (I was very young when I watched it - I know it's not unique), but I think it was so comforting to me and made me almost feel like I can romanticize my own life without having to turn into some superhero. I can just be the shy artsy dopey guy.

Again, I know this is a common trope in films but I was very young when I first watched it and I think that's partially why I built this connection to it.

The score is also amazing. Everytime I listen to the main theme it instantly brings back the entire mood that I can wrap myself up inside.

The way I would describe this movie is it's like waking up in an old creeky wooden new england house full of blankets, on a cold Sunday winter morning where the sun is shining through windows, making a coffee and thinking about a girl that you are crushing on and your stomach has a slight pain from the chronic low level anxiety you always feel, and it's this mixture of anxiety, peace, depression, sleepiness, and whimsy.",21,1757537082.0,movies,10,0.75,False

Gonna be super honest. If we don‚Äôt share similar hobbies I really will lose interest. Sorry about that.

I've been having trouble finding a song for a specific part and so I came here.

for context my main character which is a girl works at a coffee shop and she sees an old friend of hers (the friend is a dude) who she hasn't seen for 6 years. She walks up to him, he doesn't recognize her until she says a couple things to confirm and he believes her. She couldn't visit with him because she had to continue working, they exchanged numbers and agree to meet at the park and continue to catch up.

The song can be very vague as long as it somewhat matches the description. I have to be able to stand listening to it so he's my preference: any Alternative music, rock, pop, electric, and anything soft. I do not wish to have any country music or hip-hop, and no Taylor Swift unless you can't find literally anything else.

Don‚Äôt have the motivation to even go to college . Have been missing college classes and have a hard time focusing on lecture . 3 months since breakup , I was healing since trying to move on . But I feel a lot uneasy every ones n then . I was dating a senior in college who I met during my first year and it was one of the most beautiful experiences for me because he was my first kiss and my first boyfriend. We met on ethnic day where I was approached by him. Even if  I had turned down  his initial coffee date request at first but we still kept on talking on Instagram. While being unaware that we lived just one building apart (lived in college hostel ) and decided to meet one day .  we met for the first time near the side walk of our neighbourhood . He came down to meet me outside my block and went for a walk . We both were scared but tried to start random conversation. Though the date lasted only for 20 mins it was then my feelings for him started blossoming . We started going on walks before the curfew time in both our hostels ( we never met in college because of different timings ) .. going out felt like an escape from all the stress in the world just to spend these moments with him ( my ponnu) .. kept gifting each other stuffs here and there .. and I started catching feelings . I was scared that this will all come to an end as he will leave after his college is done . I knew what I was getting into but I couldn‚Äôt resist him and professed my love for him . I wanted us to get together ( within 12 days of us meeting ) and  he proposed me immediately on the night of World Cup ü§ß. As everyone was celebrating the win that night , we both sat near the lake gazing the sky full of fireworks. Everything was going good but I always felt the sadness after he leaves . He was one of the pillars of my strength , someone I felt the life was worth fighting for . Someone who I would like to share a future with . I am a very emotional person , he showed me warmth and my heart had melted . The day I didn‚Äôt anticipate had knocked on my door . He was done with his final exams and was going home far from Bangalore . He left the hostel and came to meet me for the last time here . We were both emotional and I felt pretty bad . Though we went long distance after that , we still kept texting and calling even with huge time differences. Well , he was supposed to come back to Bangalore since he was recently placed here in a company . Long distance was fine too . He said he missed me a lot and wanted to hug me when we meet . He landed the night and came straight away to meet me near my pg where I had recently shifted . We walked for a while and then I asked ‚Äú so what we going to do now that we will be separated?‚Äù .. I was still in college and he is joining workforce now . Living in different location and being in different dynamic. He answered that he will come meet me .  I asked him if we both see a future with each other hoping he‚Äôll say yes but he said the most heartbreaking sentences one would not like to hear . He was like I love you a lot but we don‚Äôt have a  future together I mean he was an NRI so he doesn‚Äôt want to stay here for long so he will just complete few years and leave for masters . I was like then what shall I do till  wait for you to dump me ? I will be heartbroken and I want to be with you .. he was like yeah so be with me till then .. but we don‚Äôt have a future .. I thought he loved me a lot but it was heartbreaking . I ended up breaking it off to him . He was fine by it too but my crazy ass couldn‚Äôt process the heartbreak that well and ended up crawling back to him . But he was done so he left . Still can‚Äôt get over him .. I don‚Äôt understand and still can‚Äôt why can‚Äôt people chose me .. am I just a passing phase ? .. Fell for someone first who said the same but had the guts to walk out . Took me years and was finally walking free . He was the one who loved me first but how could he create such scenario of letting  me go so easily ?? Kept on questioning because I was girl from a different culture ( I was from Assam and he Malayali native ) .. but nothing matters as he is long gone . I know I got issues but what makes me less worthy to beg for someone to choose me ? Everyone says I am a good person but what makes me something so easy to discard ? He is here in Bangalore living his best life but I still haven‚Äôt moved on from it . We live so near yet so far . Failing in class when I was doing so good . Look frail and lost all my self confidence. Barely a smile on my face . Was ambitious but this relationship ( my first one ) went .. unfortunately , ended on a sad notes . Will have to walk this path alone . I feel like I also dodged a bullet by not getting intimate with him ( though he insisted and later was fine by my rejection ) as what happens after he leaves ??

Zuretha Roos draws on the memories of the abundant farm kitchens of her Hex River Valley childhood, happy Stellenbosch student days and the, sometimes challenging, world of marriage and young motherhood in seventies' Johannesburg to become an accomplished cook and magazine food editor. In amongst the pots and pans, busy city life is pleasantly interrupted by holidays in Hermanus, idyllic sojourns at Keurboomstrand and weekends on an isolated farm in the Waterberg. All is blissful, if not a little chaotic, until immense tragedy strikes and her once happy family has to come to terms with a brutal twist of fate... Woven together with trusted family recipes, these tales bring to mind a time when history was shaped over strong cups of coffee and food came from the earth, the ocean and a mother's heart.)

1ndpkum,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundChecked/comments/1ndpkum/does_the_best_singleserve_coffee_maker_from/,Does the best single-serve coffee maker from Cuisinart live up to the hype?,"Testing out the Cuisinart Coffee Center SS-4N1NAS has been a delightful and mildly caffeinated adventure in my kitchen. This all-in-one coffee maker claims to combine the powers of a drip coffee machine, single-serve brewer, and milk frother‚Äîmaking the perfect caffeine companion for any home. As someone who thrives on multiple coffee doses and occasionally likes to pretend they‚Äôre a barista, I had to give this a try. Initially, I wasn‚Äôt sure if it would live up to its promises, but there are some standout features worth sharing, along with a few quirks I stumbled upon.

**Design and Build Quality**

The sleek black exterior looks modern and fits well on my kitchen counter without sticking out like a sore thumb. Although it does take up some counter space, the machine conveniently combines multiple features into one unit, saving me from having to invest in a separate espresso maker or milk frother. The build feels sturdy, though at an item weight of 14 pounds, it's not something you‚Äôll want to move around often. Even the buttons on the front are thoughtfully laid out, making the user interface straightforward. 

[Check Cuisinart SS-4N1NAS price on Amazon.](https://ultimodule.com/p/b0bwsmv57f/)  

**Performance and Functionality**

Using the coffee maker has been surprisingly simple. With the ability to brew up to 12 cups with drip coffee or switch to single-serve options‚Äîlike 6, 8, or 10 ounces‚Äîit‚Äôs suited for both social events and solo coffee binges. On top of that, the brew strength control lets me adjust the coffee‚Äôs intensity based on how much sleep I didn‚Äôt get. This customization is a nice touch that satisfied my picky palate, though it‚Äôs worth noting that the machine is slightly noisier during operation than I expected. Thankfully, it turns off automatically, avoiding the headache of forgetting to shut it down.

**Upsides**

- Offers versatile brewing options: drip coffee, single-serve pods, and Nespresso OriginalLine-style capsules.  
- Built-in steam wand delivers consistent foam for cappuccinos and lattes.  
- Features like 24-hour programmability and Brew Pause make mornings a breeze.  

**Milk Frothing Abilities**

The steam wand deserves its own praise, as it introduces frothing and steaming capabilities that rival some standalone milk frothers. It worked beautifully with both dairy and plant-based milk varieties, creating thick foam that added a professional touch to my drinks. In fact, I had a lot of fun experimenting with latte art‚Äîthough I‚Äôm still far from Picasso-level designs. Not just for coffee lovers, the hot water function allowed me to make tea, instant oatmeal, and even warm up soup on a lazy evening. It‚Äôs these little conveniences that make the product stand out.

**Drawbacks**

- Noisier than expected while brewing.  
- Cleaning the drip tray and steam wand requires regular attention.  
- The single-serve section occasionally splashes, especially with larger cups.  

**Other Options**

When comparing this coffee maker to competitors in the same price range, there are a few notable challengers. For example, the Keurig K-Duo also offers a combination of drip coffee and single-serve pods, but it lacks the milk frother, leaving latte aficionados out in the cold. On the other hand, the Nespresso Vertuo Line excels in espresso brewing, yet its pod-only system feels limiting. Where the Cuisinart model edges forward is its versatility; being compatible with both reusable filters and capsules gives it an edge.

**Price Worthiness**

Given the range of features‚Äîprogrammable brew, multiple cup sizes, and built-in frother‚Äîthe machine offers great value for money. It's a bit pricier than basic drip coffee makers but makes up for it by delivering barista-style drinks at home. I considered whether investing in separate devices would bring better results, but this 4-in-1 machine made my life simpler by blending all functionalities seamlessly. For coffee enthusiasts on a budget, this could be a worthwhile investment.

1ndpisx,https://i.redd.it/pundj7o9eeof1.jpeg,How do you get over this ?,"I have really been not doing well with loads of pressure with no one to express to . Don‚Äôt have the motivation to even go to college . Have been missing college classes and have a hard time focusing on lecture . 
3 months since breakup , I was healing since trying to move on . But I feel a lot uneasy every ones n then .
I was dating a senior in college who I met during my first year and it was one of the most beautiful experiences for me because he was my first kiss and my first boyfriend. 
We met on ethnic day where I was approached by him. Even if  I had turned down  his initial coffee date request at first but we still kept on talking on Instagram. 
While being unaware that we lived just one building apart (lived in college hostel ) and decided to meet one day .  we met for the first time near the side walk of our neighbourhood . He came down to meet me outside my block and went for a walk . We both were scared but tried to start random conversation. Though the date lasted only for 20 mins it was then my feelings for him started blossoming . 
We started going on walks before the curfew time in both our hostels ( we never met in college because of different timings ) .. going out felt like an escape from all the stress in the world just to spend these moments with him ( my ponnu) .. kept gifting each other stuffs here and there .. and I started catching feelings . I was scared that this will all come to an end as he will leave after his college is done . I knew what I was getting into but I couldn‚Äôt resist him and professed my love for him . I wanted us to get together ( within 12 days of us meeting ) and  he proposed me immediately on the night of World Cup ü§ß. As everyone was celebrating the win that night , we both sat near the lake gazing the sky full of fireworks. 
Everything was going good but I always felt the sadness after he leaves . He was one of the pillars of my strength , someone I felt the life was worth fighting for . Someone who I would like to share a future with . I am a very emotional person , he showed me warmth and my heart had melted . 
The day I didn‚Äôt anticipate had knocked on my door . He was done with his final exams and was going home far from Bangalore . He left the hostel and came to meet me for the last time here . We were both emotional and I felt pretty bad . Though we went long distance after that , we still kept texting and calling even with huge time differences. Well , he was supposed to come back to Bangalore since he was recently placed here in a company . Long distance was fine too . He said he missed me a lot and wanted to hug me when we meet . He landed the night and came straight away to meet me near my pg where I had recently shifted . We walked for a while and then I asked ‚Äú so what we going to do now that we will be separated?‚Äù .. I was still in college and he is joining workforce now . Living in different location and being in different dynamic. He answered that he will come meet me .  I asked him if we both see a future with each other hoping he‚Äôll say yes but he said the most heartbreaking sentences one would not like to hear . He was like I love you a lot but we don‚Äôt have a  future together I mean he was an NRI so he doesn‚Äôt want to stay here for long so he will just complete few years and leave for masters . I was like then what shall I do till  wait for you to dump me ? I will be heartbroken and I want to be with you .. he was like yeah so be with me till then .. but we don‚Äôt have a future .. I thought he loved me a lot but it was heartbreaking . I ended up breaking it off to him . He was fine by it too but my crazy ass couldn‚Äôt process the heartbreak that well and ended up crawling back to him . But he was done so he left . 
Still can‚Äôt get over him .. I don‚Äôt understand and still can‚Äôt why can‚Äôt people chose me .. am I just a passing phase ? .. Fell for someone first who said the same but had the guts to walk out . Took me years and was finally walking free . He was the one who loved me first but how could he create such scenario of letting  me go so easily ?? 
Kept on questioning because I was girl from a different culture ( I was from Assam and he Malayali native ) .. but nothing matters as he is long gone . 
I know I got issues but what makes me less worthy to beg for someone to choose me ? Everyone says I am a good person but what makes me something so easy to discard ? 
He is here in Bangalore living his best life but I still haven‚Äôt moved on from it . We live so near yet so far . 
Failing in class when I was doing so good . 
Look frail and lost all my self confidence. Barely a smile on my face . 
Was ambitious but this relationship ( my first one ) went .. unfortunately , ended on a sad notes . Will have to walk this path alone . I feel like I also dodged a bullet by not getting intimate with him ( though he insisted and later was fine by my rejection ) as what happens after he leaves ?? But still felt as if it was my fault I was immature, or I was not good enough .. ( more to the story wouldn‚Äôt mind if you would like to ask )

Remote App Testing Gigs Are *Exploding* in 2025‚ÄîGet Paid From Your Couch (No Pants Required!),"Wait‚Ä¶ Did *everyone* know about this new wave of **remote app testing jobs**?! Because I just checked, and it feels like I walked straight into an alternate timeline where app-testing gigs are not only legit‚Ä¶ but literally everywhere.

I thought remote work was getting more competitive, but seeing companies *fight* to hire app testers in 2025? Y‚Äôall, some of these listings pay more than my ENTIRE last internship. Not even joking!

Here are **10 companies** you can apply to RIGHT NOW from anywhere (lounging in sweatpants encouraged):

- **GoodNovel** (yes, this is real): Test their reading app, give hot takes, and work flexibly. I found out here: **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**
- **UserTesting:** Apparently, they want fresh eyes from all devices. Their tests take minutes, and pay is surprisingly decent! 
- **Applause:** These folks have an entire TESTER community. Join up, get paid for every bug you find. Wild.
- **Testlio:** Perfect if you‚Äôre picky and want assignments that fit *your* schedule.
- **uTest:** Seriously, anyone can sign up, and they offer quickstart guides for total beginners.
- **PlaytestCloud:** Gamers get paid for ‚Äújust trying out games.‚Äù Who knew?!
- **Crossover:** Mix of freelance/contract; mobile app testers especially in demand this year.
- **Rainforest QA:** Crazy how many remote gigs these guys still offer post-pandemic.
- **BetaFamily:** Literally, all you need is a phone or tablet to get started.
- **Userfeel:** Review, record, and talk about app experience from anywhere‚Äînot joking, lying in bed is totally acceptable.

But I am genuinely confused‚Äîwhy is nobody shouting about this from the rooftops? 2025 and companies basically *competing* for testers who just need a decent smartphone, honest feedback, and some curiosity!?! 

Did I miss the memo or are tech teams finally realizing how tough it is to find regular people who obsess over notifications, screens, bugs, and the *worst* onboarding pages? You don‚Äôt even have to put on pants for most of these. 

But honestly, scroll through **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** for five minutes and tell me I‚Äôm overreacting. (Spoiler: YOU WILL BE JUST AS BAFFLED.)

If someone 5 years ago told me I‚Äôd get paid to click around on apps at 1 AM while sipping cold coffee, I would have called them a lunatic. Now it‚Äôs practically a side hustle *EPIDEMIC*. 

Want to know the twist? Some of these jobs even give you beta access to unreleased apps. Which, like, hello, APP HIPSTER STATUS UNLOCKED.

But seriously, between student loans, rent, AND the price of oatmilk lattes, why out here are we NOT applying to every listing on **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**? 

Testers of Reddit‚Ä¶ is this the start of something huge, or am I just losing my mind? Sound off if you‚Äôve landed *anything* good so far (or if my algorithm‚Äôs trolling me).

I'll have to get detailed about it tho, so sorry in advance for the long story.

I've worked at a thrift store as a cashier for 1,5-2 yrs now and was fired a few months ago; due to a personal medical reason which made it hard to do my job.

When i worked there for only a few months i had to deal with shitty customers every now and then, but the one that i'm gonna talk about was smth else! It's the type where you could tell straight from the bat that something wasn't right in the head.

The first time i had to help him out he immediately tried to strike up conversation. Asking me about my hobbies which in itself is pretty innocent, but it was the way he was looking at me which made it obvious he was a creep. 

He also ordered a cup of coffee with toast. Once it was ready the toast should be cut in half and stacked on top of eachother so it'll look more neat, but due to the weight of the sandwich maker it was flat which made it looks like just one sandwich.

I served it to him and he asked me where the other half is, i explained to him that both halves were on the plate and went back to the cash register. The whole time that customers were coming up to me to pay for whatever they thrifted, you could hear him get louder and louder. Asking where the other half was and complaining about it. He got so worked up that he pulled another customer into his little riot! 

He eventually came up to me together with the other customer and they were both steaming mad about ""the other half""! 
Saying that it wasn't customer service and that he's been waiting forever, he got so mad that other colleagues got pulled from the back just to see what's going on. Just for him to pull the two pieces apart and act surprised about it, are you kidding me?!!

After he was done eating he apologized and said  i was a cute girl and wanted to ""make it up to me"". He even used my hobbies to flirt with me, saying he knows a place where i can play the drums. He couldn't get further than that tho, since i acted ditzy and dumb about his intentions. He eventually left.

The next time i ran into him was in the city.
I happened to pass him by, but didn't notice him calling out to me since i had headphones on. You'd think that'd be the end of it, but NO THIS MAN FOLLOWED ME DOWN THE STREET JUST TO TALK TO ME!
He disguised it as an innocent convo at first, but it didn't sit right with me. Eventually he brought up that the girl he was at the thrift store with was just a friend and that he ""isn't  really into relationships"" followed by him trying to ask me out and trying to invite himself to walk with me.

I made up some lie to get him off my back which worked.

Yesterday was the 2nd time i've ran into him. I tend to ignore everyone and everything around me so i didn't even notice it was him in the first place.
Only when he started following me down the street i took notice of him and he tried to strike up a conversation again.
I would've easily kept walking if i didn't know this man is mentally unstable so i felt i had to keep talking to him to appease him.

He asked why he didn't see me at work anymore and asked where i lived as well, so i made up some lies mentioning i lived with a (girl)friend. Just for him to ask if i was gay, why would that even matter to him? 
Furthermore, he noticed my wrist braces and said that a nice girl like me shouldn't wear anything like that and he kept staring at me and basically holding me hostage by talking to me.

I eventually cut him off, telling him i was in a rush and i bolted out of there.

Anyone that has been in the same situation, please tell me how you talked yourself out of it; cuz this is just getting weird to me.
I felt so uncomfortable and paranoid afterwards too.",2,1757535930.0,NoStupidQuestions,1,1.0,False

so I built a system that does exactly that like drops the query in slack, hits multiple sources (think GMB, Crunchbase, BuiltWith, Latka, Agency Vista, Clutch, Store Leads, GoodFirms, Yellow Pages, Better Business Bureau and Trustpilot the whole lineup) and spits back a clean csv‚ÄÇand the beauty about this is that its unlimited which means you can get as many lead lists as you want like 100k data, 1m, 2m, 10m literally any number and it can track anything like tech stacks, funding companies and covers almost any industry

my cold email response rates have improved too because I am finally sending to real businesses I have verified by source, not just scraped from one unreliable place

1ndp6dt,https://i.redd.it/auohmzlsbeof1.jpeg,John remembered by Brown University classmates and professors.,"Photo taken during the fall of 1979 at Brown University.

Source: Brown Alumni Magazine (1999)

He dressed in silly hats. He played ball with fraternity brothers. He handed in papers at the last possible moment. When he failed to pay parking tickets, his car was towed. When he was short of change, he scrounged for coffee money.

On the campus that Kennedy remembered fondly even as he went about the business of editing his magazine, George, those who had known him recalled someone not altogether different from many of his peers: an intellectually curious American history concentrator, a socially conscious citizen, a natural actor, a thoughtful friend, a fun-loving athlete who played rugby for two seasons and regularly joined pick-up Frisbee games on the Green, and a son hosting visits from his mother, who just happened to be the wife of a martyred President of the United States.

""His own sense of grace, sense of ease, and social poise allowed him to project an air of naturalness,"" says a former teacher, associate professor of history Mary Gluck. When meeting someone for the first time, he always introduced himself, seeming never to take for granted that everyone already knew who he was.

But the celebrity he tried to keep in check was unavoidable. Strangers sought directions to his dorm room. Photographers descended onto campus to cover his Commencement. ""He was America's prince, and he was treated as such,"" says fraternity brother and housemate John Hare '83, remembering the time the entire audience turned to look when he and Kennedy walked into a Providence movie theater. Through it all, Kennedy retained his sense of humor. ""He had a way about him that was grace personified,"" remembers James Barn-hill, professor emeritus of theatre arts.

As an amateur actor, Kennedy landed parts in campus productions of such plays as The Tempest, Short Eyes, and Playboy of the Western World. ""He took direction well,"" says Barnhill, ""and he improvised well."" In Playboy, Kennedy won the lead, a role that cast him as a meek underdog. Starring opposite him was Maura Murphy '82, who shortly after his death recalled the last lines of the play, when her character howls, ""I've lost him! The only playboy of the Western world!"" ""Now that we've all lost him,"" she says, ""memories of our self-conscious young selves struggling to put on a play and avoid feeling like jerks around John Kennedy become more painful and more precious.

To succeed at either challenge, we had to learn to trust John. And he showed us we could."" Professor of Theatre, Speech, and Dance Don Wilmeth, who directed Playboy, says that, although Kennedy had the right charisma for acting, he never seriously considered it as a career. ""I think he knew,"" Wilmeth says, ""that his persona would be too difficult to overcome.""

Kennedy was also committed to social issues at Brown, particularly to pressuring U.S. companies into divesting themselves of South African holdings until that country abolished apartheid. After visiting South Africa during the summer after his freshman year, he created a student organization around the issue with his friend Randall Poster '84. Aided by Kennedy's political connections, the group brought notable speakers to campus, including Helen Suzman, a South African parliamentarian, and Andrew Young, who had recently left his post as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations but had not yet been elected mayor of Atlanta.

At last month's U.N. tribute to Kennedy, Young spoke of seeing him at Brown: ""He wore his father's sport coat,"" he said. ""Here was this tall, skinny, nineteen-year-old preparing himself to fill his father's shoes."" Despite his campus activism, Kennedy resisted a political future. When political science professor Ed Beiser asked if he wanted to run for office, he replied, ""My mother would kill me!""

After a rocky start, Kennedy became a ""solid, competent"" student, in Beiser's words. His first college paper, written for Beiser's freshman seminar, earned a failing grade. ""He was really shaken,"" Beiser remembers. ""He said, 'What am I going to tell my mother?'""

It was a much more academically confident Kennedy whom Mary Gluck remembers walking into her office dressed in cut-off shorts to hand in his final college paper, which focused on Wordsworth. ""He said, 'Just hot off the press,' "" Gluck recalls. ""I'll never forget the enormous pleasure."" She awarded him a B-plus; he wondered what he could have done to earn an A.

After living in a dorm and then his fraternity house, Phi Kappa Psi, Kennedy moved his junior year to a house on Benefit Street with four roommates, who, over the next two years would at various times include Hare and Christiane Amanpour, who later became CNN's senior international correspondent. ""You're growing up together and no one's putting on airs,"" recalls Hare, who remained a close friend. ""With old friends you establish in college, there's almost nothing you have to say to each other or do over an extended period of time to remain friends. That's incredibly hard to replace.""

""If you really wish to honor John,"" says Richard Wiese '81, one of Kennedy's fraternity brothers, ""think of some of the things he stood for,"" such as humility and humanity. ""John was human just like everyone else, with his hopes, fears, anxieties, passions, and disappointments. It would be a mistake to make him into something he was not. And it would probably dishonor him.""

At the time of his death, Kennedy was preparing to return to Brown; he had agreed to serve on the University's advisory committee on communications and public relations and was due to attend his first meeting later this year. ",19,1757535636.0,JohnAndCarolyn,0,1.0,False

What's happening to me?","Hi again, I appeared here a while ago reporting a situation with my husband and how I felt bad about hurting him so much, but this time I think I crossed the line, there were two situations in which, due to anger, I hurt him in a new way: wanting to be authoritarian. I'm F(24) and he's M(54)

There were two episodes:
FIRST: He woke me up at the end of the afternoon, we were going to have coffee to start working at night and there was only one cigarette and he was with me, I woke him up and sat down to drink coffee and when he appeared in the kitchen wanting the cigarette I told him that I had finished smoking and he thought it was absurd that I was smoking that cigarette because I was supposed to have thought about him first and that I was selfish and self-centered which proved that I was only interested in my own things, he took the cigarette and threw it away, he also took the mug in which I I drank and threw it away and it broke, I panicked at the time, he says I'm going to go to my mother's house (who is largely responsible for my having BPD today and he knows) and I start to freak out saying that the rented house we live in has my name on the contract and that's why I'm not leaving, and from there everything escalated until he said he was leaving and I freaked out, locking the door and holding the key, wanting explanations as to why he was doing that to me and he was anxious. and feeling claustrophobic, having to hold back so as not to hit me and forcefully take the key from me, I open the door and after 3 days of long conversations we resolved it, but that remains: I shouted at him, I locked the door and stopped him from leaving the house and I used the power of having the key to do so. I was authoritarian and it affected me and him deeply too.

Last night, he had been without smoking for 8 hours and during a research process he was doing he freaked out due to withdrawal and argued with me wanting me to move away and I moved away, but him saying that I was disturbing him, bothering him and preventing him from making progress offended me and irritated me so I went to take a shower and he argued with me again and I became even more upset and even though I knew it was because of nicotine withdrawal I couldn't let it go, I kept the pack of cigarettes and 5 minutes later he appeared asking me for a cigarette, I didn't give him one, I didn't even tell him where he was and when he got stressed, he hit our trunk at the foot of the bed, put his hand close to my face and finally, *spit in my face* and called me a psychopath and once again said he was going to leave and then left the house and went to buy cigarettes... I feel dead, worthless, apathetic and completely shaken until now, but not because the fight continued when he came back and until now It was decided that he would leave, but because he SPIT IN MY FACE.... I had never experienced that. And today whenever I look at him I remember that he spat in my face. I think this even made me ""split""

He tried to talk to me today during the day at various times and everything turns into a monologue of him talking about my behavior of hiding the cigarette and not giving it and that being authoritarian because I am choosing for him whether or not he will smoke, about me not knowing how to deal with power, about me being mean to the only person who has stayed with me to this day (which is true, I was abandoned by my family and he did stay even when we didn't know my diagnosis), but I can't say anything, I can't forgive myself even though I know he's right about my horrible behavior, yeah That's new, I've been on medicinal treatment for 4 months, I've never had crises where I acted authoritarianly trying to hurt him or anyone else that I remember, but now I've done it twice. And this Monday I can't apologize to him and say that I regret it like the first time when I locked the door because he spat in my face, does anyone here know what happened to me regarding these outbursts? Why act with authority in this way? And this split that I had, at some point will I be able to go back and regret having acted the way I did? I don't want him to leave, but I can't make a fake apology because I think it would be even worse and very unfair to both him and myself.... I don't know what's happening to me....",1,1757535532.0,BorderlinePDisorder,4,1.0,False

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt scientist Stephen Hawking argue that science made the concept of God unnecessary‚Äîthat science could explain the universe without the need for a creator?‚Äù

She nodded and continued: ‚ÄúAnyway, starting in 1571, the Inquisition had the authority of the Church and Spanish crown to prosecute any kind of religious heresy, including accusations of witchcraft and sorcery. Punishment included torture and then being burned alive, slowly. And, over 80 percent of those, alleged to have practiced witchcraft, have been women.‚Äù

Wesson read from her phone: ‚ÄúThe persecution of women as ‚Äòwitches‚Äô during historical witch hunts was significantly tied to controlling women and their roles in society. These hunts served to reinforce patriarchal structures by targeting women who deviated from expected norms or held positions of power or influence within their communities.‚Äù

‚ÄúTrue enough. Accusations of witchcraft were driven by male insecurities and from their anxieties about women's reproductive capabilities and their ability to control fertility and childbirth. Look at that case, Roe vs Wade today and the battle over women‚Äôs reproductive rights.‚Äù

Wesson suggested, ‚ÄúMeet the new boss, same as the old boss.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou got that right, Agent,‚Äù said Dr. Shea who fist-bumped Wesson. 

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your own personal take, Doc, on wronged women taking justice into their own hands?‚Äù

‚ÄúIf there really are more things in heaven and earth‚Ä¶hypothetically, so where does something like the Lechuza fit in?‚Äù Off the investigators‚Äô joint nod. ‚ÄúThe core idea of individuals or groups acting outside formal legal structures to enforce their own kind of justice or maintain social order has a long history across different cultures and time periods. If someone close to you had been assaulted or raped, and the law couldn‚Äôt or wouldn‚Äôt do anything to redress that imbalance, don‚Äôt say you wouldn‚Äôt want justice. Isn‚Äôt that what comic book superheroes and all those Marvel movies, are all about‚Äîlike The Avengers, and Justice League? The stories are all about defending the weak or fighting back, right?‚Äù 

She pointed to some delicate but wondrous statues of females. Picked up one who held a sword in one hand and the scales of justice in the other: ‚ÄúNemesis‚Äîthe Greek goddess of divine retribution, often depicted with wings and a sword of retribution.‚Äù She handed it to Leo to hold, and continued as she picked up another statue with a cat‚Äôs head. ‚ÄúSekhmet is an ancient Egyptian goddess known for her dual nature‚Äîboth a fierce warrior and a powerful healer. She symbolizes destructive anger and the protection of justice.‚Äù She handed it to Agent Wesson. 

Leo handed back Nemesis, then pointed at a solid lead raptor, very stern-looking. ‚ÄúDoes that owl also symbolize vengeance?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not an owl. It‚Äôs actually a copy of a movie prop from The Maltese Falcon, that private detective Sam Spade story.‚Äù She picked up the falcon and caressed it. ‚ÄúBut an owl-woman looking out to avenge other wronged women doesn‚Äôt sound so bad. I see all these symbols of avengers in a positive light. Not as some negative force.‚Äù She smiled, ‚ÄúIn fact, if I'm out at night and I hear or spot an owl, I'm like, ‚ÄòHey sister, how are you doing tonight?‚Äô Kind of show some respect in a sense.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe think we saw one in the flesh, possibly in the guise of a trans man.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, they are thought to be shapeshifters‚Ä¶Didn‚Äôt Medi-man talk about them?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe did, as well as wormholes and stuff. Which was all Greek to us.‚Äù

‚ÄúWormholes, hmmm. Perhaps, another time. I have a class to prepare for.‚Äù

That hairless cat nonchalantly appeared and lapped at the milk in the bowl. Then glanced at the two investigators with a look that said‚ÄîYeah, so what?

1ndp0ds,https://www.reddit.com/r/robloxjailbreak/comments/1ndp0ds/ideas_for_future_robberies/,Ideas for future robberies,"Here are some ideas i thought of if they were to make new robberies in the future. I think the best place to put a new building is a bit below the casino, near the canyon desert. Here are some of my ideas:

\- A third small shop, like a hardware store where you can get a key or other one-use item that breaks you out of handcuffs once, but only outside of robberies. Also, a different idea is a cafe or something that gives you coffee that increases your jump height for a while or lets you climb walls.

\- Science Lab - Heres an idea for a robbery: A bioscience lab where you rob it by mixing a bunch of different vials of colored chemicals into different combinations, and some combinations are worth more money than others. The twist is, it is random each time which combination is worth the most money, but there are hints throughout the lab similar to the random hints at the casino code.

\- Car dealership - A car dealership where you steal a rare car and drive it across the map to an NPC on the other side of the map. But when you complete the robbery,  one of the bonus rewards you can get is  a discount off of that car when you go to buy it.

\- Hospital - Not in the canyon desert, but the hospital building could be repurposed as a robbery where you have to steal medical equipment, but the equipment will break if you arent very slow and careful when walking with it. You are able to drive with it, though.

\- Aquarium  - A robbery where you steal exotic fish. When you get in the building and steal the fish, you have to go underwater to get the fish and bring them to a collector at the pet store in the Town. the challenge comes from going quickly so you don't drown.

\- Cruise ship - A cruise ship where you have to put on a fancy disguise to steal things, and you arent allowed to take out any guns, bombs, or healing items during the robbery, or you get kicked out.

Which one do you think would be the best?",3,1757535227.0,robloxjailbreak,2,1.0,False
1ndoztp,https://www.reddit.com/r/pop_os/comments/1ndoztp/update_on_my_microsoft_todo_app_for_cosmic_1009/,"Update on ""my"" Microsoft TODO App for cosmic 10-09","Shortly - there is not much to say I guess ;)  
Privately - I've been great ;) Spent a weekend in Hungary Hajduszoboszlo - not that anyone cares, but i had limited time to work on a project.

So whats new?  
Virtual lists are coming!

other than that progressbar is comming:

Also limit of 50 task is gone now. Although..... I have to think about it - it is quite slow when you have thousands of finished tasks in one list like I do :)

I've spent literary 3 days working on flatpak and I can say two things now:

1. i know much more bout flatpak
2. i hate it ;)
3. still it does not work for me ;)

i wanted to release flatpak version 0.1 ,but it seems to have a rendering issue I could not solve.  
And..... I do not follow Why flatpak is so hyped. If you trust the author (you should if you can read the code ;) ) then what kind of issue are we trying to solve with this sandboxing and all ?

anyway.  
i'm kinda getting close to an end . I love this project. I want to finish it before I will switch back to my OneDrive client. UI is a part I have to completely rewrite. I have learned a lot In here.  
What is a status that project?  
Well I'm using it on daily basis and I find 2 files getting conflicted whole the time- other than that it it perfect! When I will finish here I'm going back there.  
I use obsidian on a daily basis and it works! So not so bad :)

Oh and MS TODO  has been updated to latest libcosmic.

It was ""some"" pain  to do it, but not much. I find it funny that we are about to release cosmic DE Beta based on...... libcosmic ""WIP"" , based on iced 0.14 :)  anyway I love it  ;)

Disclaimer:  
I'm not system76 member and not really a member of cosmic-utils (maybe someday?). This is third party contribution based on ""tasks"" project from cosmic-utils (fork! thanks to the author Eduardo!) .
