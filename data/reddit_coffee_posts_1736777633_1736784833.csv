I know what feeling hopeless can do to a young mind, and its killing me to see so many smart young people be so lost on here. How could they not be though? We all are, but I would be remiss to say that it isn't harder on anyone under 25. 

I know everything seems incredibly bleak kiddos, but if you want to be able to do something about how you feel, **you must act.** The best thing for you to do is to **find or MAKE community.** The only thing in life that makes it worth living are the connections we have with other living beings. I'm telling you, there are people your age nearby that feel the same way you do. They just might take a bit of time to find, but that effort is worth it. **You might be the one who saves that other young person from blinding despair. That is meaningful, that makes real change. That is WORTH doing.** 

Being on this forum is one form of community, but nothing really compares to being with those who can relate to you in more ways than just being on here. 

How does one do this? 

\-Look up mutual aid groups in your area. **If there isn't one, start one.** This may seem like it is a daunting task, but really, all organizing can start by grabbing a coffee and having those important conversations. Here's a[ link](https://afsc.org/news/how-create-mutual-aid-network?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAkJO8BhCGARIsAMkswyhyJ_wXwYf-GZu_CQQLTjDOtgJTTzVYksGn3HHe2KTn5bitoSJeS-MaAs2BEALw_wcB) to help start. 

\-Volunteer at a group that is already established and start talking to people about these issues. A lot of inspiration can be sparked by knowing someone else might benefit from your help or company.

Lastly, you're not dead yet. There are still so many things you can do to make this hell ride an easier one for yourself and others. You can make a difference, even if it seems hopelessly small. It is something.

For the past few years, I've had worsening symptoms and have had to cut so much from my diet that I'm surprised I'm able to eat varied meals anymore. It started with cutting out coffee due to getting crazy acid reflux, then cutting out most processed sugars, and had progressed to cutting out all tomatoes, milk, anything greasy or fatty, gluten, and avoiding high fructan foods like apricots, garlic, onions, and pistachios. 

Symptoms at this point include: Dizziness, nausea, ataxia, LUQ pain, sometimes RUQ pain, loose bowels if I eat something I shouldn't have, heart arrhythmia that flares up with certain foods, fatigue, shortness of breath at times, lots of mucous after eating certain foods and sometimes a stuffy nose, and a globus sensation with certain foods. I also get chest pain that we think is esophageal because EKG's showed nothing happening while I had those pains. This usually all happens 2-3 hours after eating food. The worst symptoms are usually alleviated after having a bowel movement, but I'm usually off feeling for a good 24-48 hours after eating triggering foods. 

I sleep elevated at night on a wedge pillow because I'm otherwise waking up with acid in my throat, which is causing me a sore throat and enamel erosion on my teeth. I also wake up feeling sick sometimes if I don't sleep with the wedge. 

I've had so many tests run on me, and on paper, I should be perfectly healthy. CT scans of all the organs in my abdomen show no issues, no masses, and no lymphatic swelling. EKG, echo, and Holter monitor shows low burden (0.1%) PVC's that flare after I eat food, but I'm otherwise perfectly fine. My blood tests all show I'm perfectly fine but a little on the anemic side (has been this way for almost a decade but is getting better with time), but ferritin and iron are fine. Upper endoscopy came back perfectly fine, no evidence of any damage, and pathology shows no issues with the four different samples they took - no h. pylori, no celiac sprue, no intestinal metaplasia or dysplasia, and no eosinophilic esophagitis. Barium swallow test showed that I have moderate gastric reflux, especially if I lay down, but nothing else was seen.

My primary sent for allergen testing to two different facilities but both rejected the referral, saying my symptoms don't line up with allergies, but she still wants them to look me over and is fighting them on that. She also is sending me to another gastro for a second opinion and to get hydrogen breath testing done. I'm sure a colonoscopy is next as well.

I'm just so lost... I wish I felt as good as all the tests indicate I should feel... I just want to be able to eat without fearing that I'm going to be out of it for the next 24-48 hours... I'm tired of constantly fearing that I'm missing something serious, like if every chest/back pain is my heart giving up... 

I just want answers... I want my life back...",1,1736784572.0,GERD,0,1.0,False
1i0hdvr,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1i0hdvr/struggling_making_sense_of_a_messy_relationship/,Struggling making sense of a messy relationship and how to move forward,"I'm a 35m that dated this 40f on and off for about 3 years and I am having trouble understanding what happened in the end. I'm looking for insight or advice, or maybe a shared similar experience to help me make sense of all of this, and properly move on. Finding myself overthinking, lacking sleep and it's also getting in the way of my work and my parenting responsibilities. 

I'd really like to just get this off my chest and seek some validation that I am not a crazy person. I feel like none of my friends and family really understand just how to difficult this relationship was and how hard I tried, and why I am so upset in the end. 

\-We matched on Tinder. She messaged me first. We went on a date, spoke a ton about our goals, values and what we wanted, and there was alignment. After about a month of dating she told me she had feelings and wanted to be exclusive. I accepted. First time someone ever asked me to be their gf.

\-She is a super busy mom of 3 kids and works two jobs. Our schedules conflicted often but when we hung out we would always have a great time, and the sex was incredibly passionate. I made sure she was always pleased. Over time I fell in love with her hard. I did everything I could to meet her love language of acts of services and words of affirmation. 

\-After about 2 months she said she needed space and was feeling stressed and wanted to be alone. She still had feelings for her ex-husband.

\-After granting space a couple weeks later she would message me seeing how I am doing and ask to come over for a coffee. She came over, we would open up about our feelings, told me she slept with her ex-husband, somehow I forgave her, we ended up making love, and then we were back together.

\-Cycle repeated over and over. Every single time she was stressed she would totally disengage from the relationship. Every stress was different, sometimes it was money, sometimes it was because her car, sometimes it was family, sometimes it was because of her kids. Discovered attachment theory, found out she totally fits the description for someone with avoidant attachment. At the time I fit the bill for anxious attachment, and took a ton of therapy since then to become secured. I suppose that was a blessing in a way.

\-After a few times I said f this. Some of the times I got mad and told her off and blocked her everywhere, followed by unblocking and apologizing after I cooled down. Most of the time I just lovingly let her go, following dating advice from Corey Wayne to just love freely and let go, and focus on my purpose, and avoid difficult women. Not easy to do as I felt like my feelings were unexpressed and suppressed but ok.

\-Everyday I would think about her. Heck, I'd think her about almost every minute of every day.

\-Same thing happened again and again after each ""break"". She'd reach out, see how I am doing. She'd apologize, slowly start talking again, and then we'd get back together yet nothing really changed, just empty promises on her end. Over time I realized I did nothing wrong, this pattern and stress response was on her end and had nothing to do with me...but in the process I discovered something important about myself:  Communication is the most important thing for me in a relationship. Whenever communication lacked, and she hid her feelings or thoughts, I suffered.

\-For the next while I gave it absolutely everything. I loved her with all my heart. Love notes, gifts, flowers, dates, accommodating her needs as best as I could...even when we had our struggles we had no doubts that the love was real. We jammed with a band together. We really did have some great times, although they weren't often due to scheduling constraints. 

\-She was always tired. Constantly exhausted from work and her kids. Felt like whenever we were together she would just give me breadcrumbs, all we ever started doing was chilling at her place and Netflix and chill. Soon her coparent scheduled changed from 1 week on to 2 weeks with kids at a time. She always wanted to spend quality times with her kids, which I respect and understand as I am a single dad too. I started to feel like I was missing out on life. In my opinion she never really had time or energy for a serious relationship and was kidding herself. 

\-She took therapy because apparently the relationship was hard on her too. She expressed she didn't know what she wanted or needed, and her expectations of me. It was really hard on me because I consider myself a great communicator. I even tried to help her make a list of her wants/needs expectations for her future relationship, but over and over just kept hitting a stone wall with her. Sex was the strongest thing about our relationship but that was about it. 

\-Over time it just felt like she was not interested in anything to do with my life, or my thoughts and opinions. She would routinely disengage. I tried to not make much of it, but deep down it really hurt. We would go on dates and have nothing to talk about. All she ever talked about is her problems or her family, or gossip, and I am a nerdy intellectual who loves to talk about anything other than that stuff. The last time I stayed at her place was exactly like this. I thought were both just tired, but no. I asked her if everything was okay. She said yes. As soon as I got home though she opened up by text. It really frustrated me because I had told her many times how important it was for me to have these convos in person, but I guess not. 

I lovingly said ok all the best, you have my friendship but from here on out I am going to date someone else and have not heard from her since. 

I have no doubts that in the next few days or week my ex will text my ""how are you doing"", or ""have a good week"", and I got to be honest here, I don't know what the heck to do. In the past I have just matched and mirror her behavior (i.e. ""good thx, hbu, ok, blahblah, take care!"" But it always reboots the cycle. I hate ignoring people. I think blocking is immature. I'm upset and sad, and in a lot of pain, and don't want to lie about my feelings to her, but I also don't want to make her feel guilty either and I also don't want to give her the satisfaction that this was the right thing. She has no idea what she lost. There are not many guys that will give someone so many chances, and make so many compromises. I do wish her the best, but am struggle finding the balance between feeling righteous about putting myself first, without being a total dick in the process. I offered my friendship and to part ways lovingly, but I am bitter. I don't really want to be friends. What is the point? We couldn't connect as lovers, how could we connect as friends? 

I think I have been through enough. I think just peacefully ignoring her completely is the best thing to do. I have already gotten rid of all the photos of us together and deleted all texts. Now I just need to train myself to stop thinking about her when I catch myself reminiscing. I just feel so dumb. This relationship was far from logical and I don't know why I kept taking her back. All I know is she made me feel a certain way and I am going to miss her very much. 

Thanks for listening. 

TLDR: Struggling moving forward from a messy relationship with an avoidant and looking for any advice you might have to help me stay positive. If she reaches out and asks how I am doing should I lie and hide my feelings and tell her everything is fine or be honest?

1i0hdh6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i0hdh6,"Baja Divide: a rugged route through cactii, coastline and mountains","I just finished riding the grueling Baja Divide, one of my all time favourites. Zigzagging down the peninsula of Baja Mexico on some really challenging trails at times, it takes you through some of the best desert landscapes I've seen. Camping on remote wild beaches, watching the birds that migrated here for the winter, finding that small source of water that's left from years of drought. It's also an ideal winter destination for those in the northern hemisphere, with temps often around 25C this time of year. The one thing I found it deeply lacking was a cultural experience, which I look forward to as I take the ferry to mainland Mexico and continue south.

Just be prepared for a grueling ride with lose rocks, washboarded roads and a bit of soft sand. Don't attempt without plus tyres. You could take the highway, but it often lacks a shoulder. Drivers are super courteous though, and most will move over more than I've seen in any other country.

If there's one suggestion I leave future riders, it's to learn even some basic Spanish and download the Spanish language on Google translate so you can communicate in remote areas. That's how you have truly memorable experiences, like the time I asked for water and was asked to sit. Some locals get curious about what you're doing in their country, and if you engage with them in their language you can learn a lot about them.

Also. Don't ever skip Mexico because of safety. If you're really worried, start here in Baja. It's absolutely safe, with the only real issues being as always in the bigger cities, but this is especially true near the border. I've heard stories of some cyclists flying over Mexico, while I think it's one of the best countries to tour in.

I'm in La Paz for the next week before I catch the ferry to mainland and continue as far as I make it till it gets too hot or rainy. Then I'm looking at heading back north for the summer, and returning in the next dry season to continue through the rest of Latin America.

But yeah, at the start of December my cat (who I was extremely close to) had to be put down unexpectedly and it was the worst thing that's ever happened to me. Then the week after, university broke up for winter holidays so I'm off til February. Then I got a sick note from the doctors as I was deemed not fit for work (retail job lol) until the new year due to grief and anxiety. Then when I returned to work a few days after the new year, they immediately said that they didn't think I was cut out for retail so I quit my job. Then my best friend got ill so I couldn't see them, resulting in me not really leaving the house cus there wasn't really anything to leave for, no job, no university, no friends. Then my psychiatrist gave me 3 new medications to try, one meaning I can't drink alcohol (I enjoyed going to the pub at the weekend) another meaning I can't drink caffeine (no coffee for me 🥲). Plus, two of the medications sent my blood pressure so low that it was a bit dangerous so I don't know what's happening with that and my psychiatrist won't listen to me when I say it's definitely 1000% the medication that did it. 

So yes, here's a summary of my life changes, please help me, thanks 👍🥲 
- my cat was put down unexpectedly 
- my university is still on winter break 
- quit my job 
- best friend (only friend) is ill and so I can't see them 
- 3 new psychiatric medications that are causing me trouble 
- can't go pub or drink coffee anymore 😭

1i0hbwr,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Gloomy_Music_7907/comments/1i0hbwr/morning/,Morning,"I feel cranky. I started my period last night. I knew intellectually that I have been pmsing but I haven’t had time to feel the physical changes within my body because I have been so busy. 
I did notice swollen, achy breasts at some point over the weekend but I didn’t have time to let it stop me. My appetite has been larger but I thought that had to do with all of the physical activity and long days. I also wasn’t able to just like, sit around and eat so I contributed a lot of my hunger to just being a fat ass.

I was reading about espresso last night; evidently, bitter or sour espresso is not a good thing lol. It’s supposed to have a mousse like texture. Who knew? I’ve been drinking bad espresso my whole life lol. Which is funny because my espresso has been pretty mild. We didn’t buy espresso beans because we were exhausted and just needed coffee. Anyway, my shots just tasted like coffee. No bitterness, no sourness, no acidity. I thought I was making the espresso shots wrong. I do have a mousse-like texture. Tamping down the grounds seems like an unimportant thing that impacts the product a great deal. I think I tamped down my grounds too hard yesterday because when I cleaned the thing, it was all watery… as if there was a clog. 
I was reading that some of the tamping down can cause the sour and bitter flavors. 

I am starting to realize that a lot of shit was left at the studio apartment. I suspect what happened was mister got overwhelmed and told them just to take the boxes. I suspect he disassociated. Due to several factors. On one hand I am frustrated. I needed him to manage that situation while I made room for them here at the new house. But, I also understand that this situation has been really hard on him and he did the best he could. We will hopefully make a visit to the old house to get the rest of the belongings tonight. We have furniture to dump and cleaning to do. I feel so exhausted. My body is at its limit. 

He’s been leaving wrappers and different things around the kitchen. I know he wants to keep this place tidy. Everyone functions better in a tidy space though it occurs to me that my tidy and his tidy may be a little different. I have made a complete transition into my grandmother who would stop a whole operation to pick a hair off the floor. Balance. I just keep reminding myself that extremes serve no one and messes are cleanable. There’s no sense in hurting my relationship over this. Though, sometimes I feel more like a caregiver than a partner. Sometimes I think this impacts our intimacy as well. It’s difficult to have a romantic relationship when I feel like a caregiver. But …he provides care for me too. Last night he used the massage gun on my super sore back, he’s been carrying the financial spill over, he drives, he set up the utilities. So. I’m not a one man show. Even though we both feel that way at times. 

I washed my “liberation blanket”. (It’s pink and has a raised, puffy flower motif. I bought it when I first moved to the PNW because when I lived in Ohio, all I wanted was a pink bedspread. I wasn’t even into pink then. I just liked the softness of pink bedspreads and I desperately wanted softness in my life. The first thing I did when I was financially stable was buy a pink bedspread). I slept with my pink velvet blanket last night. I missed it. I won’t be able to sleep with it long if I want to preserve it. The cats have taken an understandable liking to my soft belongings which is killer on my allergies. I want to keep this dumb blanket for a long time. I feel sentimental about it. 

I feel sentimental about clothing too. As I was unpacking my clothing I noticed that I could recall a special memory (or bad memory) attached to each piece of clothing. “Comedy club with d to see bill burr”, “the glass museum walk with j”, “first time visiting my job”, “job interview at Aetna”, “climbing beach rocks at the coast”, “my aunt bought this for me in New Zealand”. I have found a few Ohio belongings and I have gotten rid of most of them. That was 5 years ago. I don’t think I need to hold on to those memories anymore. As I face going through my office, i will maintain this mindset. 

Well. It’s time for another coffee and I forgot to take my vitamins. Whoops. I did a really bad job of following through with my routine goals. I’m going to give myself a pass because it was a rough night and I have been busting my ass lately.

I would’ve expected my cravings and dependance to increase with the years, but that doesn’t seem to be the case for me. On the contrary, the last few months my body seems to reject cigarettes. Now, when I don’t drink (I smoke a lot when drinking), I very rarely have the urge to smoke and I even find it annoying when people smoke near me. 

Because of this, I decided to try quitting cigarettes as well as alcohol for a month. So far so good. Apart from associating coffee with a cigarette, I’ve had no cravings whatsoever.

Long story short: I’ve had zero issues quitting these past two weeks. Does anybody else have this too? I get a bit suspicious of myself knowing the struggles people face when quitting.

Backstory: I'm a part-time volunteer for a charity, theres another volunteer there who I've only actually met twice and I've never had much of a conversation with him, but he seems pretty chill. Just before christmas he somehow got my phone number and started texting me once a week to ask if I wanted to meet for coffee. I kept putting it off because I don't know what his intentions are. I'm not sure whether to just go for this coffee and assume its innocent (like he just wants to be friends or something) or to assume theres a deeper, darker intention behind it. The last time I blindly trusted a guy and became friends with him, he literally ruined my entire life so I dont know if my reluctance is my intuition trying to tell me something or if its just my anxiety over what happened last time. Is there a polite way to ask someone what their intentions are?? I feel like I can't just be like ""why do you want to meet for coffee?"" cos I'd sound rude😅thanks for making it this far if you did.

1i0h2pb,https://www.reddit.com/r/penpals/comments/1i0h2pb/back_to_bothering_paper_again/,Back to bothering paper again.,"I’m Anik , a writer, poet, and playwright (basically a professional daydreamer who occasionally puts words together in a way that sounds smart). My life revolves around literature, theology, and philosophy because apparently, I thought, Why not overthink everything while also sounding pretentious? Spoiler alert: it’s both rewarding and exhausting. My brain is powered by a potent mix of ideas, existential crises, and just enough caffeine to keep me teetering on the edge of enlightenment - or a nervous breakdown, depending on the day.

I’ve been scribbling letters since I was six , mostly to my grandmother, bless her patience, and occasionally attempting to send her postcards… without stamps, naturally. (Turns out, the postal service doesn’t appreciate my creativity.) Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of forging some amazing connections, most of which I’ve had to let go. Not for dramatic reasons, mind you - just your garden-variety “it’s not you, it’s me” scenarios.

Lately, I’ve been toying with the idea of picking up the pen again, but procrastination is my middle name. Today, however, I finally decided to make good on that thought.I’m absolutely thrilled to meet you, well, not “meet” in the literal sense because, you know, letters...but close enough! And if you feel inspired to write back, I’ll be so grateful I might even send you a postcard. Don’t worry, this time I’ll remember the stamp. Probably.

When I’m not passionately arguing with myself about the meaning of life (or why tea will forever outclass coffee), you’ll find me in the kitchen, experimenting like a mad scientist who traded test tubes for spatulas. Sometimes it’s a culinary masterpiece; other times, even my dog looks concerned.

Rainy days are my love language. Give me a cup of tea, a slightly obscure book that makes me question my existence, and the sound of raindrops, and I’m in heaven. Bonus points if I can curl up in a blanket and pretend the outside world doesn’t exist. Bliss. But don’t worry, I’m not just a brooding intellectual; I’m also surprisingly fun. Like, “philosophical debates over pizza and bad puns” kind of fun.

I’m all about connecting with people, especially those who can tolerate my quirky humor and occasional deep dives into why we’re all here (or why pineapple on pizza is a crime against humanity). Fair warning: I laugh way too hard at my own jokes and will absolutely judge your food seasoning skills.

In a nutshell, I’m equal parts thinker and clown, with a dash of culinary chaos. My DMs are open, so slide in like a confident penguin on ice. I promise I won’t bite , unless you offer me unseasoned food or subject me to Dad jokes gone wrong.

Again. 




I was driving along the highway to work. 




Again. 




To my job. 




At the plant factory. 




Ruminating on how sad this world has become. 




We used to grow plants. 




In the wild. 




Now we build them. 




With materials such as lead paint. 




Such as sulfur. 




And such as mulch. 




In the factory, they don't even let me touch the plants.




""Your just a machine supervisor. Just watch the machines in case they start acting up. And stop watering them. Of course, they aren't water dependent. You're just here to fill our humans quota, remember? 




Stop pouring water on the equipment."" 




These are the things my boss, Siri, always tells me. 




And so I watch the machines. 




How can a plant grow without water, I wonder. 




In the factory, the only thing protecting me from the machine debris is a high school football helmet and shoulder pads.




My legs are completely exposed, and during Autumn season, they are shredded by the falling aluminum leaves. 




At least the pay is good - 7 PlantersCoins a month. 




---------------------------------

Funny enough, The Company grows the machines in the same fields we used to grow oranges. 




All my life I wished the tangerine, clementine and orange fields would burn to the ground, taking their sour flavor and nauseating aftertastes with them. 




And now as I drive to work, I find myself reminiscing of the days I hated them. 




And so I drive along this highway as I always do. 




As my Honda Accord sputters, a drunk driver in an 18 wheeler flies by me in the carpool lane. 




As he speeds past, I find myself continuing to watch the driver. 




As if I'm watching him from inside his rearview mirror. 




It's at this moment I remember I lit my Honda Accord on fire six years ago to protest Big Lumbar chopping down the redwoods in Central Park. 




It was two days before easter, and I had forgotten that my trunk was filled with plastic eggs for the hunt I was organizing. 




They said the net effect of the emissions from all the melted plastic was the same as the effect of all the trees being cut down. 




Looks like I did nothing wrong then, I told them. 




------------------------




I remember now I stole this truck from a Wawa parking lot in Tuscaloopha, Montama, the night before. 




The end of another great night with the boys. 




The boys, of course, are my two sons. 




Jepito, Pejito, and Tejipo. 




There's a Poland Spring gallon jug between my legs. 




Filled to the brim with I Can't Believe It's Not Sake. 




I look in the rearview mirror into the truck bed. 




It's my only son - Kiddo Junior. 




His paintbrush jolts with every bump we hit on the highway. 




He's painting a mural on the inside wall on the truck. 




To an outsider, it's another abstract mural bound for the landfill. It's ink thrown against the wall by a male-presenting 11 year old who's never seen the inside of a classroom. 




The circle of life often feels like a straight line, Jepito tells me as he paints. 




I take his comment with a grain of salt. 




He never took geometry. 




In fact, he's never even seen the inside of a classroom. 




As his father, I've always known he was an outdoor cat. 




Trapped inside the body of a boy named Jepito. 




-------------------------------------




I used to love Eggs Benedict. 




I had it every day. 




I even ordered it during lunch meetings with Prime Ministers, fighter jet pilots, and bank tellers from around the world.  




I broke yolk with some of the most powerful people on Earth. 




With my network, we could pass laws, fly wherever we wanted, and withdraw money from whomever's bank accounts we desired. 




Until I betrayed the entree that started it all. Haven't had it in years. 




Eggs. Benedict. Arnold. 




A lover of eggs, now a shell of my old self. 




Working for companies like Shell, Exxon Mobile, and PlantBuilders Corp. 




Companies that build plants that ingest air and release carbon dioxide. 




It's why I named my only son Photosynthesis. 




So people wouldn't forget. 




Until he had an accident as a child laborer in the factory. 




He ate a berry from a mechanical plant. 




Most of his body burned as he laid in agony on the bed of the lava river inside of the plant. 




And when Plantbuilders Corp revived him, he was more machine than man. 




More evil than good. 




I guess the whole reason I'm writing to you, Duke, is to warn you. 




You can be A New Hope. 




Our Duke Skywalker to Photosynthesis' Anakin. 




But Photosynthesis, if your listening, don't forget: you can still become a Miti-Chondrian. 




A powerhouse of the cell. 




And so I drive to work. 




-----------------------------




Recently I decided I'd get up early to watch the sunrise. 




But my phone died in the middle of the night so it never shouted at me to wake up because it was out of power. 




I slept until 7 pm. 




But I wasn't going to miss my sunrise. 




Not today. 




So I tied my feet to a neighbor's balcony and hung upside down watching a sunrise, while the others watched a sunset. 




Life is all about perspective, I guess. 




The last thing I remember is my neighbor, Julian, who was out on the balcony, shouting inside to his wife.




""Christine, why does it smell like feet out on the balcony?""




Then I passed out from the blood rushing to my head. 




----------------------------




And so I drive to work. 




Just a normal guy, earning his paycheck. 




-------------

I pull into a Starbucks on exit 77 to pick up a to-go order as I always do. 




I walk up to the pickup counter. 




Shit. 




No ones ordered anything yet. 




Looks like another breakroom coffee is in my future. 




---------------------------




It's 9 am exactly.




I pull into the parking lot and walk into the factory. 




Just on time, Craig, my supervisor says.




Another day, another PlantersCoin.

Banana skins, often discarded without a second thought, could be the unexpected hero in your quest for a brighter, more radiant smile.

The Science Behind Banana Skins and Teeth Whitening

How Banana Peels Work Their Magic

Banana skins are packed with an impressive array of minerals and nutrients that can potentially transform your smile. The peel contains:
- Potassium
- Calcium
- Magnesium
- Manganese

These minerals work together to help remove surface stains and promote overall dental health. The process is surprisingly simple yet scientifically intriguing. The inside of the banana peel contains special compounds that can help break down stubborn tooth stains caused by coffee, tea, and other discoloring substances.

The Mineral Powerhouse of Banana Peels

**Potassium compounds** in banana peels are particularly effective at addressing tooth discoloration. Studies have shown that these minerals can help:
1. Remove surface stains
2. Remineralize tooth enamel
3. Reduce bacterial growth
4. Promote overall oral health

Research suggests that regular use of banana peels could potentially be as effective as some commercial whitening treatments, but without the harsh chemicals typically associated with teeth whitening products.

Implementing this natural teeth whitening technique is surprisingly simple:
- Select a ripe banana with a yellow peel
- Gently rub the inside of the peel on your teeth
- Leave the residue for 10-15 minutes
- Rinse thoroughly with water
- Brush your teeth normally

Expert Tips for Maximum Effectiveness

Professional dental hygienists recommend:
- Use the method 2-3 times per week

- Reduced tooth sensitivity
- Enhanced mineral absorption
- Natural antimicrobial properties
- Cost-effective alternative to expensive treatments

Scientific Perspective

While promising, researchers continue to investigate the full potential of banana peels in dental care. Preliminary studies indicate significant potential, but more comprehensive research is needed to definitively prove long-term effectiveness.

Precautions and Considerations

Important Safety Notes

Before beginning any new dental treatment:

Conclusion

Natural teeth whitening through banana skins represents an exciting frontier in holistic oral care. While not a complete replacement for professional dental treatments, this method offers an accessible, affordable approach to maintaining a bright, healthy smile.

1i0guow,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1i0guow/making_the_most_of_toofine_grounds_breville/,Making the most of too-fine grounds [Breville Bambino Plus],"Just got my first machine, the Bambino Plus, last week and have been having a fun time playing around with it. Unfortunately, I am still waiting on my grinder, it should come in the mail this week. I didn’t want to just sit around so I bought some coffee from my local roaster and have been pulling a few shots a day. The problem that I’ve been having is that my shots are all overextracted and they taste BAD. They take a little too long to start flowing but once they start they seem to flow just fine and they have a pretty decent looking crema. I am pretty confident that the problem is that they are a little bit too fine but there’s nothing I can do about that at the moment. I would like to keep using them while waiting for my grinder to come in. I know it won’t be perfect but I would rather not waste the coffee. Is there anything I can do to make them taste a bit better? 
So far I’ve tried adjusting how much I’m using by about 1 gram in either direction (~15-17g) and tamping less, but that hasn’t seemed to help. I also weighed and timed the shot, and it seems like it’s going too fast. In roughly 27 seconds it is around 36g, and by the time I’ve pressed the button and the machine stops it’s at like 42 grams.

""It’s official - I’m running for Mayor of Hoboken!

I have proudly served our community on city council since 2018 and I’ve seen firsthand the impact good, local governance can have on everyday life. Be it filling annoying potholes and cleaning up trash on your daily commute or tackling big issues like housing affordability and public safety, there truly is no task too big or too small if you’ve got the right attitude. 

Hoboken has come such a long way over the years, but there is still so much work to be done to make this special city an even better place to live, work, and raise a family. And as a mom, you better believe I’ve got a long to-do list with new ideas to continue improving our community.

We’ve got more work to do for better schools, safer neighborhoods, improved constituent services, public transportation that works for all of us, and real transparency and accountability in how decisions get made and taxpayer money gets spent.

I’m looking forward to meeting you in living rooms, coffee shops, and parks across our city in the weeks and months ahead. I hope you’ll join us and be part of our grassroots, community campaign.

I think she is my twin flame. She was adamant about breaking up. At first, I blamed her for her temper and harsh tone as the reasons we fought so much in the end. But then I shifted my focus to myself and started understanding all the unhealthy patterns I brought not only to this relationship but also to my 20 year marriage. Things stemming from childhood that made me feel unheard, which made me overly focused on fairness and feeling heard in adulthood, which was detrimental to my partners feeling heard when I was hurt. 

I've realized I want to be a more generous person and not focus on fairness. And I want to be a forgiving person and let things go instead of holding onto hurts until they're acknowledged. 

And I swear, yesterday just walking around North Park in SD, I felt my whole body feel peace for the first time in my life. Just completely present. Not worried about the future and not regretting the past. My nostrils got so clear and I was breathing so deeply into my belly. I was at a coffee shop later just sitting their alone, totally content. Eyes closed and fell into like a 25 min trance. Like a meditative state. I've never felt so peaceful. 

And it made me realize that peace is even better than euphoric love. And now I know I want to protect my peace. Even though I really miss my ex girlfriend and the love we had. ",3,1736782848.0,spirituality,3,1.0,False

I would notice if a male liked me, and usually if they did they would go out of their way and do nice things for me. 
I wasn’t a flirt, I was not slutty, I did not dress too revealing (sometimes would be extreme baggy clothes and sometimes form fitting outfits), I was friendly and I thought I was treating everyone nicely - but looking back some of these things were not exactly nice of me- because most of these people wanted more from me than I realized at the time. 
I had a friend who got a pager for his bday one year, I didn’t have a pager yet, so I told him I was jealous and he basically gave it to me for a few months until I got my own, I also would not return his pages when he would page me on the pager that was his. 
A classmate who worked at the movie theatre had a crush on me and I would go to the theatre with a friend (boy or girl didn’t matter) and i would ask him for free passes- he would give them to me but I didn’t  talk to him any other time. 
An older guy I met at a job I had, he was probably 19 at the time, I was 16- I went to an Aerosmith concert and he was working security and I asked him to help me meet Aerosmith and he gave me his backstage pass so I could go and meet them. He gave me his number and I never called him. 
A person worked at a local sex shop, he would come into a coffee shop I worked at and would flirt with me, I didn’t have any interest and he knew I had a bf, he invite me to his store for free shopping sprees - I would go in and get outfits and random things. I only spoke with him while I was working and when he finally realized there was nothing going to happen he started to date a coworker and my freebies were cut off lol
If I was ever offered a ride home by a male I always took it, no matter how creeped out I felt, I just didn’t want to take the bus. Nothing bad ever happened, but many times at school or work, if there was any interest shown in me and they had a car, I was very nice to them. But would always have them drop me off a couple blocks from home so they never knew exactly where I lived. 
Someone who would flirt with me at the coffee shop worked at Sam Goodie so I had endless free CDs back then, in exchange I would give them a free drink tho. 
I worked at the Mall of America at a kiosk, so many people would walk by and I would always have people flirting, but one guy would try and try to talk to me and I wasn’t interested. But we would have just normal convos. I told him after work I was going to go buy some shirts from PacSun and this guy would almost daily go around the mall and boost clothes for me, I didn’t realize he was stealing until mall security stopped him and he was arrested. 
There is so many other situations like this that the list is too long. 
I don’t remember most these people’s names but I sure hope they didn’t grow up to be door mats for women, because they kinda were to me at a young age and it wasn’t right how I treated them in the end, I mean like I said I was always nice to them but I was also using them and I have grown to realize that and it wasn’t cool.

The sandwich was good too, masarap. Although I expected it to be bigger (or longer) since baguette sya. But its the same size of a hotdog bun. And hindi gaano karami yung salami.

I'm sorry to post this here but I really needed to share this and I'm genuinely frightened. To be clear, I'm not asking for medical advice.

I'm currently on the waiting list to start a treatment programme with an ED clinic. In the meantime, I've been trying to increase my intake (particularly at weekends). This has been really challenging physically due to my IBS, even with the medication prescribed by the clinic to take before meals. So what I've been doing is increasing my intake but spreading it out during the day.

Yesterday, was a ""normal"" day. I had breakfast, lunch and dinner and snacks in between. I definitely did not binge and stopped eating when I was full each time. I went to bed as normal. The only medication I took was the one I was prescribed.

This morning I woke up as normal and went for a gentle walk. It was after I got home that it happened. All day, I've been unable to keep my eyes open and keep on wanting to sleep. The problem is that each time I fall asleep I have the most terrifying nightmares. They always have the same theme:

>!Someone or something is holding me down and will not let me move. I try to fight them but I don't have the strength. They're literally crushing me and it's like I'm paralysed. I genuinely think I'm going to die and eventually pass out. It's then I wake up.!<

I've never had such terrifying nightmares in my life and don't have any other symptoms. I'm genuinely scared to eat anything and only been drinking water all-day and coffee to try and stay awake. I'm really worried about falling asleep in case the nightmares come back, as no exaggeration, they have each time I've slept today.

I've contacted the ED clinic but my doctor is currently on holiday. I just don't understand why this is happening when I've been doing my best to recover and following the advice of the clinic and my doctor.",2,1736782055.0,EDAnonymous,2,1.0,False

I got my bilateral salpingectomy last Friday, today makes my third complete day of healing. I received a good amount of peace of mind from other people sharing their experience so it's only right I share a bit of mine. 

  
I'm a 27 year old female, I live in western Kentucky. I found my doctor through a few recommendations around town, and I don't believe I saw him listed on the child free reddit list, however if you live in the western KY region I can confirm that Baptist Health in Paducah, KY's OBGYN office was *phenomenal* in helping me receive this procedure. My doctor gave me no pushback, was very pro-my choice. I never could have dreamed for the process to be as smooth as it was, a big part of my putting this off was because of the difficulty I thought I'd face in the attempt to pursue it. I believe with the times and gravity of our situation as women, my voice was heard a little clearer. I went for my initial consultation at the start of December (the 2nd), was scheduled for one pre-op appointment for bloodwork and to ensure I hadn't had a change of heart on the 19th, and my surgery was scheduled for January 10th. Leading up to surgery I decreased my alcohol consumption and marijuana consumption. I've had issues with the interacting with the anesthesia in the past, so I was extra wary of this. Even with being cautious, I smoked up until 48 hours before the surgery. I know that information may not be relevant to some, but for my fellow flower enthusiasts do not worry. I was very honest with my doctor and anesthesiologist about my smoking habits, I will mention that I do not smoke any cigarettes or vapes, strictly weed. Also in leading up to surgery I spent a good amount of time cleaning my house and preparing to recover, it made a world of difference. 

  
The night before surgery I had to wash with a sterilized soap wash, I washed with it again the morning of surgery. Slept on clean sheets and put on clean clothes. The morning of surgery I had to be there at 7:30am; Upon checking in I was given a buzzer to wait for a room which happened relatively fast. The worst part of my surgery was the waiting. After being admitted into a room, I changed into my fancy hospital gown and gave the nurse a pee sample to ensure I wasn't pregnant. They installed my IV and left me to chill until anesthesia was ready for me. I waited for roughly 5 hours before making it upstairs to the next step. From there, everything moved very quickly, I was given something to relax and wheeled into the surgery room. The nurses told me to think of the beach and next thing I know, I was waking up with a new nurse offering me a sip of water. I remember an intense pain in my belly button and she offered me something for the discomfort, then I was wheeled to outpatient once more. They gave me my property to get changed, I changed on my own with a relative ease, and was escorted out in a wheelchair to go home. SO surreal, SO fast. 

My first night home wasn't awful, I was shockingly awake for how exhausted I should have been. Ate some soup, some mashed potatoes, walked around a good bit, probably squatted more than I should have, and eventually went to bed. I propped myself up in sleeping with multiple pillows both behind me and alongside of me because I know of my tendency to toss and turn. Laying down truly *hurts,* so I highly recommend having a sleeping area set up that's comfortable enough for you to sit in a fairly elevated position. Now, day two (Saturday) was rough. A lot more discomfort, I was much more stiff. I woke up in the middle of night one and took one of the prescription pain pills my doctor prescribed. Other than that medicine, I used ibuprofen to mitigate the pain and it was very effective. Ate some soup, drank some coffee, had sushi for dinner a the restaurant which was slightly uncomfortable but perfectly manageable...though I would maybe not recommend as the car is not a comfy place to be. I learned on this day also that laughing is AWFUL. Laughing hurts so bad, so be extra careful of the company you have around hahahaha. The worst pain I have felt in recovery is from laughing so hard that I couldn't stop, it was torturous. Sunday things mostly just feel weird. Less achy, ouchy pain and more just super unnerving weird sensations. I felt/still feel like I could feel my insides folding in on theirselves, or my ribs moving. After some of that gas has exited, I just feel like I can feel some extra space with my insides just jiggling around. Today is Monday, I returned to work because I am a maniac and I can't afford to miss a day on my paycheck. I'd say that today everything still just feels weird, though I am hurting more today than yesterday. It could just be the environment, but also could be discomfort in my chair or clothes. Regardless, I am managing okay so far. I still have some pain medication left, but I do feel I have been managing my pain with my marijuana consumption as well. 

  
Anyways, that's all I can think to share! I'm more than happy to answer any questions about my experience, and I am so stoked to say that I'm a part of the land of infertility. Good luck to all of you in your on pursuit! <3 If you are thinking about having this operation, 10/10 highly recommend. I was very nervous as I had never had surgery before, but everything has been beyond worth the trouble.

Drinks & Snacks, I was truly so thirsty and so hungry but never hungry enough for a full meal. Kept drinks with electrolytes nearby, drank plenty of water, and ate lots of popsicles. I know this seems like something that should just be a given with surgery, but I would hate for it to be forgotten. 

Gas-X & stool softener, the gas pain is real. The constipation is real. I took both of these as soon as I got home and still didn't have a bowel movement for over 24 hours. 

Massage gun. huge deal. Helped a ton with shifting the gas pain around in both my back and shoulders. Also helped with some of the blood flow issues in my legs. ",7,1736781949.0,sterilization,2,1.0,False
1i0gelr,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_azzamina/comments/1i0gelr/best_purchase_ever/,Best purchase ever! ,"I knew that shopping in Taobao was always better than shopping at AliExpress. However, I didn't know how to do that for a long time. About a month ago, I finally found the page CNFans. I know it sounds like a cliché advertisement, but seriously, I recommend this page to everyone!

Cuz not only did it brighten my life with fun toys for my Christmas tree and long-wanted phone cases I didn't dare to purchase on Ali because of either the price or the quality of a thing being ordered. So, all in all, I found this amazing train that goes around the tree. And it is mounted on the tree! I just love the thing, my morning literally starts with making myself coffee and breakfast and sitting near the Christmas tree, watching how this little train goes around and around it.

All the other Christmas decorations, that are the keys that are reflective in the lights, two types of snowflakes, and something that looks like a giant icicle also made it so much better and shinier. Maybe arrived a little late for Christmas(2nd of January) still it makes me feel like I am little again and the real vibe is in here.

The last but not the least are those magnifique phone cases! Just look at them - they are gorgeous!

i work in a college town, but i’m far enough from campus to not suffer the pain of poor tips from students. yes, we get the occasional flood of students who don’t tip, but they’re always pleasant to talk to and serve regardless. most of our customers are locals who love to spark up conversation. everyone in my town has just been so nice to me, and i think i’ve only ever had one rude customer in my time working there. 

our shop is clean, and we have staff that cares about that, which i feel So lucky to have. i’ve never seen anyone neglect a single detail in our shop, or even in the back of house. i have a specific coworker that i Love working with because we both seriously just lock in and do shit. it’s awesome. 

my manager is kind and understanding — a little goofy — but it brings our dynamic together. my coworkers have become some of my closest friends and i cannot imagine working in a shop without them. we all have the same energy and beliefs, and it’s just so comfortable working with them. 

our pay isn’t exactly the best, but the tips we make from our regulars really make up for it. god i am just so thankful. So so thankful. 

oh also every time i need time off, my coworkers are always willing to cover my shifts. Which is huge for me. 

ive never experienced such a blissful service job. it’s wonderful.

What do you guys think, I know bottom line answer is to move on. But based on her current behaviour, does it look like she is more conclusively trying to resurface in my life?

Its very long so if you do read it, I love you!

**17th May**

First date with a girl in May 2024, great date.

**1st June**

She came over 2nd date and we made pizza together and slept together.

After that, she pretty much pursued me and we ended up seeing eachother weekly.

**June - July**

As the weeks went by into approx, things moved along as you'd expect. She kinda love bombed me, making me meet her friends and telling me they keep talking about how much they like me and how good I am for her, she would bake me cakes, message me multiple times and was really sweet to me, i began to fall for her. After which I increased frequency to x2 weekly.

She would often talk about how we had the best sex shes had in so long, literally telling me its the best ever and I genuinely felt it was.

**Late July - 3rd Aug**

First week of Aug, I could tell she was losing interest for example when we would go out she would state that she would want to go home alone and me not sleep over as she needs to work on uni dissertation. Or one time she invited me over and said ""just so you know, no sex as im getting my flora right""

Fair, I never complained or anything.

Also noted her becoming a lil ruder and more dismissive and less willing to commit to plans. After that, i got the slow fade. First few days she apologised for being MIA and said she wanted to check if I'm okay, then we spoke here and there but i could tell she checked out. Was my fault, got too lovey dovey and relationshippy fast, which she actually always reciprocated but whatever, got upset about her talking to an old BF and we had no label, so I can see where i went wrong. She gave me many indications prior that she wanted to be my girl but i never formalised it.

We were very very sexually compatible, spoke about life, had a deep fondness and care for one another but that raw attraction wanting to rip eachothers clothes off wasn't there (I know thats not always gonna be there but we had only been dating for 2.5 months)

**Post Ghosting 3rd Aug**

3rd august last time i ever saw her, and on this day she was taking vids of me sending them to her friends and showing me her friends responses of ""you guys are so cute together"" then next day after Ileft hers, she pulled back completely.

At first sending me memes still and liking my stories, and then nothing. I never reacted or asked her why she was pulling away or anything, but i did become more active on instagram, posting more outings like dinner and bowling. I think she picked up on this and deactivated her insta.

**20th Aug My Birthday**

Got a quick whatsapp at 5pm saying ""happy birthday Hun,"" that was it.

**22nd August - Bday Meal**

I storied on insta a dinner time shot of me at the table and she replied with ""who are you with"" with an eye rolling emoji, which I was just with my brother but found this confusing given shes the one who ghosted me.

**1st Sept**  
I caved while her insta was deactivated and sent her ""hey, hope you are okay"" to which got very lukewarm responses. I asked her to LMK if she ever wants to have a walk or drink coffee to which she just liked the message, and made unrelated small talk.

a few days later she asked me if I wanted to pick up these thank you cards work gave me that I left at hers, as she is moving out in a few days and doesn't know what to do w them. I told her i would try to pick them up before she left, but if not she could just throw them.

We then made small talk and me thinking that her telling me about the leaving cards was code for her wanting to see me, asked her out again. She just left it on read this time (or delivered, idk i deleted the chat) so that was officially the end.  
She jumped back on insta in this period, and unfollowed about 100 people including a lot of past lovers, but she kept me.

**Mid Sept - Oct 27th**

I went kinda NC, still posting on insta and viewing her stories but never reaching out.

in Late October, she put a pic of her empty apartment with the caption ""moving"" i replied saying ""that amazing storage unit we built is no longer there :("" she responded saying

""omg, i was literally pulling it apart today thinking about you""

I responded ""good times"" and asked her where she was moving to

She did not acknowledge the ""good times"" message and just told me what area she was moving to, so I just liked the message and left it.

Again, I thought she is not interested so leave it.

**Her first initiated contact since ghosting/slow fading me in August - 18th November 2024**

She breaks no contact on 18th November, first time shes broken it. She responds to an insta story of my buddy messing around doing a rap freestyle and responds ""omg this is diabolical"" i just react with a laughing emoji.

Then I went on a round the world mega trip, and when I was in Thailand i put a story of me trying mango sticky rice, something that I told her I wanna try when we were dating.

she then replied to it saying ""omg long time coming"" to which i responded ""was kinda underwhelming"" she replied ""yeah i sensed it"" and I replied saying ""you set the bar too high with the lime cheesecake u used to make"" she just liked the message. Again, im not gonna take this as a sign, so I just move on.

**I got excited cause she had been responding to my stories and I tried to initiate contact myself:**

I sent her a pic on my travels like 5 days later of some cartoon she really likes which i saw in tokyo, she just responded with loads of laughing emoji's, okay again not interested it would seem or just breadcrumbing / testing the waters. I know not to initiate any contact anymore.

I then went to Mexico, where my stories became a lot more party centric, taking (group) photos with my arm around bikini clad model looking girls, having so much fun in general.

IDK if this got to her or made her jealous but I noticed, she had then muted my stories and would not watch them at all. I thought okay, she's really done, but who cares anyways, its December and I haven't seen her since august anyways.

So last contact was 5th Dec when I sent her the pic of her tokyo cartoon.

**She starts repeatedly contacting me 10th Jan 2025**

On 10th Jan now, I have virtually moved on. if i post to social media, she is not on my mind as I know she will not view my stories anymore.

Also keep seeing her posting stories lowkey taking digs, like she posted a meme about having no dating highlights for the whole of 2024. Also lots of posts about depression and lonliness.

I posted a selfie with the caption ""feel to shave my beard off"" and she responded saying ""do it""

I responded saying ""why? so u can tell me i look like a predator uncle again!"" (a joke she made last time I shaved)

She responded ""yes <3""

Again, I have low expectation so I just emoji react her message.

Later that day, she then sends me a meme of something to do with a jamaican man which I just liked and responded ""lolol"" and she then responds ""say it plsss"" because she used to always laugh when I did my jamaican accent.

I voice note her back me doing the accent and she responds with loads of laughing emojis and ""top tier""

I am just confused, she wasn't talking to me from Aug - November and now she has slid into my Dm about 4 times in total and she seems to be upping the ante as before she just replied to stories but now shes going out her way to send memes and get me to voice note her.

Again, I know ""why do you want someone who doesn't wan you"" and I get that, I am pretty much over her but now she is applying some pressure I can't help but look back on the times I spend with her.",1,1736781814.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Before the start of the pandemic, I was down to 145 pounds from a high of 400 pounds.  During the pandemic, I stopped walking, stayed home, and baked way too much.  i have done it without drugs or weight loss surgery.  

I should feel great, and I do feel much better physically, but I had an incident at church yesterday that has an emotional tailspin.  I was walking toward the coffee table, and someone stepped in front of me and told me, ""No cookies for you.""  It hurt so much I am not sure I want to go to church anymore.  I don't want to be with people whose hatred for me lies just below the surface.  

At a former church, I had three confrontations about my weight, when I was at my heaviest.  At one of these confrontations, while they professed to ""care"" about me, they told me they were too busy to help me.  I didn't want much, I just wanted them to maybe call me once a week, to see how I was doing.  I felt what they were really asking was for me to leave.  

My final confrontation came with help, ""I'll go to weight loss meetings with you.""  I committed and I did lose a lot of weight.  I hate the messages I get from people that say, we won't love you if you are fat.  

I should be rejoicing by finally losing some of my pandemic weight, but I am filled with grief, over still being that fat person, despite losing more than 200 pounds.  

However, I have learned the only good reason to lose weight is to feel better, and I do.  I am proud of my progress, but I still feel like I will always have to live in fear that I will become the social pariah if I gain weight back.  

I know that in my experience as a fat person, I have experienced a lot of hatred from people.  I really wish I could say that Christians are different, but the only difference is that Christians ask your permission before they hurt your feelings.

1i0ga7b,https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/1i0ga7b/things_ive_learned/,Things I’ve learned ,"So I am not an experienced long faster. I just wanted to give some information that has helped me as a beginner. 

I started IF 2 years ago. At first it was uncomfortable for me to go 12-14 hours. I struggled to sleep. I was a person who would get hangry every 2-4 hours in the day. 

Slowly this became easy. I did use hacks like one tablespoon of MCT or heavy cream in some tea and first but then was able to do it with just water. 

Now I can fast for 24 hour with just water no problem. But I want to take it to multi day fasts. I felt super intimidated. I have realized I rely too heavily on carbs. So I am on day 8 of a lower carb diet, 30-50g per day. At first I was eating a few bars that were ‘keto’ with fake sugar. This was actually making it harder for me to not want carbs and sugar. I would recommend, at least at first avoid things like that. They are also highly processed. 

I am going to do my first 48 hr fast as a ‘dirty fast’ using coffee and tea with one tbs of heavy cream if I need to. 

It is said a lot on here but I want to emphasize, take it slow. My hunger cues and hormones we so out of wack and it’s been a slow journey walking them back to normal. 

I’m not overweight, 5’9” F at 150lb with an athletic build. I do a lot of mountaineering and ultra running. but the way I was eating and how food made me feel there was a problem. I just felt horrible all the time. I had SIBO and other GI issues. I had some irregular blood draws but nothing concrete. My metabolism was getting ‘broken’ after a life of never having to worry about what I ate. IF and OMAD have been amazing tools. 

Some people can just jump right into 3 day fasts. But if you are not one of those people right away, don’t give up. Start slow, there is no shame in doing dirty fasts. For me it’s taken 2 years to set myself up for doing multi day fasts. 

I do not plan on being keto or ‘afraid of carbs’ the rest of my life. The goal is to be able to eat reasonable amounts of high quality whole food carbs. I want to do multi day water fasting a few times a year for the GI reset and the cellular health benefits. I will practice IF for the rest of my life, but with flexibility around social events.

I’m from New Zealand and will be living in Vancouver for 3 months for work. I’m staying by BC Place and I’ll be doing a 9-5 and apparently a lot of overtime (I don’t know what this office’s expectation is of me just yet). I want to make the most out of this trip sooo here I am!

A bit about me:
Other than work taking up most of my time, I’d love to make new friends without having to drink a bunch of alcohol every single week.

I love to eat, cook, play video games (not very good), play board games (favourite is telestrations), explore?, just trying new things, literally anything

I’m a big optimist and a bit quirky. I have some pretty dry, sarcastic and dark humour - I just love to laugh. 

I’ve already booked this upcoming weekend (17th-19th) to go to whistler to ski. I’ve never seen real snow, and I’ve ski’d once on fake snow. 

Anyway, I’d love to hear from you if you’re keen to catch up for coffee or play video games or whatever! Thanks :))",2,1736781483.0,Vancouver4Friends,1,1.0,False

So its difficult for me to understand if I am at fault or if the other person is at fault in social situations. I have had extremely unfair childhood where I was humiliated, shamed and both physically and psychologically abused like many of us in this sub , so I have trust issues , I also when I start trusting people never second guess them ? (takes really long to trust someone but when I am in a situation where I keep meeting them regularly , like at work , or family or my spouse , after a few days I start becoming brainwashed to kind of think and believe their POV and start to believe that they are right and they really want good things for me ) , but when this gets challenged , in an argument or disagreement if the other person comes out and says really mean things about me , it becomes like a wake up call for a dream I have been having . So my spouse and I yesterday had an argument regarding helping around house, he promises to do dishes and even if it takes 3 days I am not supposed to get angry or question why it hasnt been done and when i do question I have to be speaking calmly and if I lose my cool he blames me as a problematic person , so yesterday in middle of an argument I called his mother a evil person for all the things she did to me (She questioned my timeline of pregnancy in front of extended family , when I had placenta previa she demanded I give her my medical reports so that she can get them corroborated , she told my husband he can go and live his life and work peacefully and leave me back with them- FIL and MIL and that she will fix my attitude ) and he in turn indicated that my mother is a whore , he did not use the exact word - he said “Your mother attracts everyone in town “ ,after a few minutes of arguments and me questioning him , he said “She attracted your father “ and for the rest of the next few hours he kept denying it and when I said its not fair that he is simply denying it , he said I am making this up and that I have psychological issues (He knows my trauma , depression all other issues that happen because of my trauma) and now he is forced to agree even though he never said it in first place. He also doesnt use protection even if it means I have to get an MTP , he said and I quote “He thought whats a big deal in carrying child and that I should do it “ , even after I repeatedly said I cant have another child, he also wont even buy anything I want (want not need, he will only cover basics like rent and vegetables not even fruits) if i am not working , so I am forced to work , he is conditioned to believe men shouldnt help around house , so for doing dishes every day - (he is supposed to  but more often than not sink is full and he gets to it whenever he wants to - it could be once in 3 days or 2 days , I am supposed to not question quality of work ) he expects me to parade him . He also never has any conversation with me during coffee or dinner and never has any real conversations with me related to money or anything. Only reason I am staying is for my
Child, but I have a feeling that I am being emotionally abused in this relationship. Could most of this be my trauma responses , he also said yesterday when I told him that there are co workers who showed genuine human interest (I specifically clarified its not romantic interest) , he said they might only want sex and if they ever get to know me they wouldnt want to do anything with me . Part of me feels like I am being abused and part of me feels like I am making up all of this in my head because I have issues. Please help me get a perspective . ",1,1736781390.0,CPTSD,2,1.0,False

What do you guys think, I know bottom line answer is to move on. But based on her current behaviour, does it look like she is more conclusively trying to resurface in my life?

  
Its very long so if you do read it, I love you!

**17th May**

First date with a girl in May 2024, great date.

**1st June**

She came over 2nd date and we made pizza together and slept together.

After that, she pretty much pursued me and we ended up seeing eachother weekly.

**June - July**

As the weeks went by into approx, things moved along as you'd expect. She kinda love bombed me, making me meet her friends and telling me they keep talking about how much they like me and how good I am for her, she would bake me cakes, message me multiple times and was really sweet to me, i began to fall for her. After which I increased frequency to x2 weekly. 

  
She would often talk about how we had the best sex shes had in so long, literally telling me its the best ever and I genuinely felt it was.

**Late July - 3rd Aug**

First week of Aug, I could tell she was losing interest for example when we would go out she would state that she would want to go home alone and me not sleep over as she needs to work on uni dissertation. Or one time she invited me over and said ""just so you know, no sex as im getting my flora right"" 

Fair, I never complained or anything.

  
Also noted her becoming a lil ruder and more dismissive and less willing to commit to plans. After that, i got the slow fade. First few days she apologised for being MIA and said she wanted to check if I'm okay, then we spoke here and there but i could tell she checked out. Was my fault, got too lovey dovey and relationshippy fast, which she actually always reciprocated but whatever, got upset about her talking to an old BF and we had no label, so I can see where i went wrong. She gave me many indications prior that she wanted to be my girl but i never formalised it.

  
We were very very sexually compatible, spoke about life, had a deep fondness and care for one another but that raw attraction wanting to rip eachothers clothes off wasn't there (I know thats not always gonna be there but we had only been dating for 2.5 months)

**Post Ghosting 3rd Aug**

  
3rd august last time i ever saw her, and on this day she was taking vids of me sending them to her friends and showing me her friends responses of ""you guys are so cute together"" then next day after Ileft hers, she pulled back completely. 

At first sending me memes still and liking my stories, and then nothing. I never reacted or asked her why she was pulling away or anything, but i did become more active on instagram, posting more outings like dinner and bowling. I think she picked up on this and deactivated her insta.

**20th Aug My Birthday**

Got a quick whatsapp at 5pm saying ""happy birthday Hun,"" that was it.

  
**22nd August - Bday Meal**

  
I storied on insta a dinner time shot of me at the table and she replied with ""who are you with"" with an eye rolling emoji, which I was just with my brother but found this confusing given shes the one who ghosted me.

**1st Sept**  
I caved while her insta was deactivated  and sent her ""hey, hope you are okay"" to which got very lukewarm responses. I asked her to LMK if she ever wants to have a walk or drink coffee to which she just liked the message, and made unrelated small talk. 

a few days later she asked me if I wanted to pick up these thank you cards work gave me that I left at hers, as she is moving out in a few days and doesn't know what to do w them. I told her i would try to pick them up before she left, but if not she could just throw them. 

We then made small talk and me thinking that her telling me about the leaving cards was code for her wanting to see me, asked her out again. She just left it on read this time (or delivered, idk i deleted the chat) so that was officially the end.  
She jumped back on insta in this period, and unfollowed about 100 people including a lot of past lovers, but she kept me.

**Mid Sept - Oct 27th**

  
I went kinda NC, still posting on insta and viewing her stories but never reaching out. 

in Late October, she put a pic of her empty apartment with the caption ""moving"" i replied saying ""that amazing storage unit we built is no longer there :("" she responded saying 

""omg, i was literally pulling it apart today thinking about you""

I responded ""good times"" and asked her where she was moving to

She did not acknowledge the ""good times"" message and just told me what area she was moving to, so I just liked the message and left it.

Again, I thought she is not interested so leave it.

**Her first initiated contact since ghosting/slow fading me in August - 18th November 2024**

  
She breaks no contact on 18th November, first time shes broken it. She responds to an insta story of my buddy messing around doing a rap freestyle and responds ""omg this is diabolical"" i just react with a laughing emoji.

  
Then I went on a round the world mega trip, and when I was in Thailand i put a story of me trying mango sticky rice, something that I told her I wanna try when we were dating.

she then replied to it saying ""omg long time coming"" to which i responded ""was kinda underwhelming"" she replied ""yeah i sensed it"" and I replied saying ""you set the bar too high with the lime cheesecake u used to make"" she just liked the message. Again, im not gonna take this as a sign, so I just move on.

**I got excited cause she had been responding to my stories and I tried to initiate contact myself:**

  
I sent her a pic on my travels like 5 days later of some cartoon she really likes which i saw in tokyo, she just responded with loads of laughing emoji's, okay again not interested it would seem or just breadcrumbing / testing the waters. I know not to initiate any contact anymore.

  
I then went to Mexico, where my stories became a lot more party centric, taking (group) photos with my arm around bikini clad model looking girls, having so much fun in general. 

IDK if this got to her or made her jealous but I noticed, she had then muted my stories and would not watch them at all. I thought okay, she's really done, but who cares anyways, its December and I haven't seen her since august anyways.

So last contact was 5th Dec when I sent her the pic of her tokyo cartoon. 

**She starts repeatedly contacting me 10th Jan 2025**

On 10th Jan now, I have virtually moved on. if i post to social media, she is not on my mind as I know she will not view my stories anymore.

  
Also keep seeing her posting stories lowkey taking digs, like she posted a meme about having no dating highlights for the whole of 2024. Also lots of posts about depression and lonliness.

I posted a selfie with the caption ""feel to shave my beard off"" and she responded saying ""do it""

  
I responded saying ""why? so u can tell me i look like a predator uncle again!"" (a joke she made last time I shaved)

She responded ""yes <3""

Again, I have low expectation so I just emoji react her message.

  
Later that day, she then sends me a meme of something to do with a jamaican man which I just liked and responded ""lolol"" and she then responds ""say it plsss"" because she used to always laugh when I did my jamaican accent.

I voice note her back me doing the accent and she responds with loads of laughing emojis and ""top tier""

  
I am just confused, she wasn't talking to me from Aug - November and now she has slid into my Dm about 4 times in total and she seems to be upping the ante as before she just replied to stories but now shes going out her way to send memes and get me to voice note her.

  
Again, I know ""why do you want someone who doesn't wan you"" and I get that, I am pretty much over her but now she is applying some pressure I can't help but look back on the times I spend with her.

My dog passed away in March which was sad but we knew for a long time it would happen so I was prepared for it. What wasn't I prepared for? COVID. The first reason why I loved lockdown was because I was getting burnt out of going to school and work straight after school. Online classes were such a huge breath of fresh air. I would wake up in the morning, have a few cups of coffee, boot up zoom, listen to the class in the background and play Call of Duty. I would do that for about 4-5 hours, do a few hours of school work and go to work in the evenings.

Lets talk about my job. My job was classified as an essential business by the state so especially in the early parts of lockdown it was one of the only places that was open and it was super busy which for the most part I really like. Also that whole spring, summer and fall they gave out unlimited double overtime so especially when school let out my paychecks were thick af. We also had a really tight knit crew in our garden department and in lot I work at Home Depot and there was an we are all in this together feeling. Also because of the layoffs in restaurants the seasonal hires we got that spring and summer were really good and some of the ladies were super attractive and fun to work with.

Also, 2020 was when I got into Anime. If I wasn't doing zoom classes, playing Call of Duty or working I was watching Naruto. That show came into my life at the perfect time. Lots of episodes, charming story, action especially in Shippuden and good sound track to boot. I was so enthralled with the storyline of Naruto I would often times find myself thinking about it alot at work and discussing it with my co workers.

Now it is time for the ladies. 2020 I had a close female friend graduate High School. I was 4 years older than her and we both agreed when I graduated High School that we wouldn't talk because of the age gap. Fast forward to December 2019 when she is 17 we kind of start talking again. Fast forward to March-April 2020 during lockdown she is 18 now, all of her classes are online, most nights during and after work I am texting her and she is sending me a ton of spicy noodies of herself and with one of her bff's. She ended up sending me a ton of solo and lesbian amature content with her gf and that stuff put me on cloud 9. Often times I would be at work in the evenings and she would hit me up saying that she was with her gf and if I had any requests for when I got home.

Fast forward to now covid is basically over, I am slightly older than I was then, All except for one of my co workers that I worked with during lockdown have moved on, one passed away in a car accident. I have watched all of the major anime that I loved during covid especially Naruto and One Piece, My girlfriend graduated college, has a career, is engaged, and her father passed away over the summer, her bff moved states and here I am still working the same job I had during covid, slightly different position but I basically feel like I have been standing still. I have been looking at different jobs here and there and I think i have found a few that I would like to apply to but I really miss life during covid lockdown. I feel guilty about missing it because I know it was a really shitty year for a lot of people but for me personally it was one of the best years I have ever had and I doubt I will have another year like it moving forward.",5,1736781229.0,CasualConversation,3,1.0,False

I’m a little confused about how to handle the per diem on my taxes, and everytime I try to google this I get conflicting answers. A few resources have said I don’t have to list per diem, but that can’t be right?

So my question: do I list my per diem as income, and then list the food I purchased while traveling as a business expense to offset the per diem? Also the food I had while away working was more than what I received for per diem - can I only write off to the per diem amount I got or can I go over that? (Also what counts as food I can write off for business expenses - take out? Grocery shopping? Grabbing a cup of coffee?)

\- **7 Days to Die** ***(With server-side Mods)*****:** Since I have so many hours into this zombie survival game, I play using server-sided mods (meaning if you do join me on an experience, you won't have to add the mods to your client.)

\- **Project Zomboid:** More zombies, and bigger hordes! What’s not to love?

\- **ROBLOX:** Where imagination knows no bounds (or physics).

\- **Minecraft:** Let’s build a digital kingdom or just dig a hole straight-down that leads to another lava pit of death!

\- **Phasmophobia:** I promise to scream less and take good photos… maybe!

\- **Nightingale:** A cozy fantasy experience that just screams “let’s live our best lives.”

\- **No Man's Sky:** Space exploration galore! Beam me up, Scotty!

\- **Palworld:** Because who wouldn’t want to collect magical creatures?

\- **Jackbox Party Packs:** The ultimate test of wits and humor with friends (or strangers!)

And so many more! My collection is bigger than your mother's spice cabinet collection! (Yes, I went there. Bite me!) In all seriousness, if we vibe well and click like a well-oiled gaming machine, I’m totally down to try new games, too!

So, if you’re intrigued and think we’d make a fabulous gaming duo, don’t hesitate! Shoot me a message with a little tidbit about yourself, the games you enjoy playing, and, of course, your Discord info! Let's turn this digital introduction into a legendary gaming saga. 🎮✨",4,1736780557.0,GamerPals,0,0.83,False
1i0fw28,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1i0fw28/is_it_normal_to_pull_a_smooth_citrusy_espresso/,"Is it normal to pull a smooth, citrusy espresso?","Possibly silly question but want to ensure I'm on the right track...

If the bean lists a citrus fruit as a flavor, is it normal to pull a smooth shot with a strong citrus flavor (not necessarily exactly what is listed, but _something_ like it) instead of the usual bitter taste? I know taste is subjective, and I found it quite enjoyable, but I’m not sure if this is what we should be aiming for with espresso.

This morning, I brewed two shots from a bean that listed a sweet orange note among its flavors. The first shot was smooth with a mild citrus note, _almost sweet_ but not quite. The second shot had a stronger citrus flavor—more like a nice, balanced sourness, not bitter or acidic. It felt more like I was drinking a flavorful juice rather than espresso. Crema was very high on both shots thanks to WDT.

Both had me going ""wow!"" for slightly different reasons. In both cases it felt very different than drinking ""normal"" espresso. It was a surprisingly refreshing experience, unlike the usual dark, bitter espresso I've had in the past. 

Is this the kind of result I should aim for, or is this more of an occasional surprise?

In previous attempts (a few years ago) when trying to make espresso I always needed some form of sweetener to make it palatable. And when asking for flavorful espresso at coffee shops (including the one that roasts this bean) I've only gotten the dark and bitter cups that require sweetener. As a result I’ve always preferred velvety cappuccinos at coffee shops because espresso was always ""too bitter."" 

By contrast, what I made today (and have been getting closer to recently, but not as _good_ as today) is drinkable straight with no sweetener or cream or anything added to it, and at first felt almost as creamy as a capp due to the large amount of crema.

If this type of smooth, easily drinkable flavor is the norm, I might be a convert to straight espresso! But it may ruin me for coffee shops haha.

Here are the details for anyone interested:

- **Bean**: Medium roast (doesn't say, but looks medium to my eyes) with several flavors including a sweet orange flavor listed on the bag. 
- **Workflow:** Ground 18g of powder using dialed-in Mignon, WDT, rotary distributor then tamped. Pre-flushed group head to heat it up. Used timing scale under cup during shots. Manual double shot. Pre-infusion about 8-10 seconds on each shot.
- **Shot 1**: Focused on time not weight, pulling long (40-42 seconds) which produced about half a cup (5.4oz cup size so nearly 3oz) of liquid. Smooth, citrusy, very drinkable, but almost like a blend somewhere between espresso and drip coffee. Looking at charts online maybe this is a lungo?
- **Shot 2**: Focused on output weight not time, stopping at 40g (34-35 seconds). Stronger citrus flavor, more like a smooth, pleasant sourness. Think sour as in tasty well-balanced cocktail with nice juicy flavors, not sour as in bad or overly acidic or astringent.",1,1736780551.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

1i0ftcf,https://www.reddit.com/r/drarry/comments/1i0ftcf/fic_prompts/,Fic prompts ,"Hey, so I love writing but I’m currently 100% not able to write something because my life is so busy. Sooooo, I thought I might leave some ideas I have in mind and I’d be honored if someone likes it enough to write and post here if you do!!!!

1) Draco owns a potion store and he needs assistance. Harry thinks he could use a hobby since he quit Auror training.

“Well, I don’t care if you’re the savior of the fucking Wizarding World, Potter. Right now you’re the savior of Roses.”

“I didn’t mean to set them on fire.”

“Well, when I fire you I’ll use that excuse as well.”

——

2) Draco works in a coffee shop. Harry Potter married a muggle who seems to love disgusting drinks. Draco hates making them, but (deep inside) loves seeing Harry everyday. When one day Harry Potter alone comes in and orders something different, Draco can’t help but wonder where Ms. Strawberry Frappuccino is.

It’s been 10 years since The War, and Draco still hates muggles. He hates making coffee and latte and bloody strawberry Frappuccino with extra strawberries and extra milk and all that fucking disgusting thing Harry Potter orders every time he walks into the coffee shop. But most of all, he hates that Harry Potter thinks it’s okay to bring his muggle wife with him every single goddamn time. Like Draco couldn’t be a better fucking muggle than her.

When Draco looks up and sees him, he takes a deep breath. “Hello, sir, welcome to Connie’s, what can I get you today?”

“A coffee, please.”

——

3) It’s been 2 years, Draco shouldn’t really be wondering if Harry meant it when he said he’d write him a love song if he was good with words. But when they’re sitting with all their friends in front of a bonfire, and Harry pulls out an acoustic guitar, he can’t shake the thought away.
Because it still stings like a fucking bitch when Harry starts singing, his new boyfriend watching him like he not only said it to him too, but actually wrote it. Like he means more than Draco ever did.

“All I see is red, red all over you
Green reflection of mine on yours
My heart painfully painted blue”

——

4) Harry is jealous of watching Draco Malfoy getting all the men he set eyes to. He’s jealous of Draco. Or is it of all the men who get with him? Merlin.

“Look at him,” Harry mumbles, “all over Draco,” he takes a long sip of his firewhiskey, “it’s bloody ridiculous.”

Hermione raises one of her eyebrows. “Harry, Dylan literally hit on you and you turned him down.” 

“What?”

“Last week.” She stays silent. “Are you sure it isn’t Draco you-“

“They’re going to the fucking loo, Hermione.”

“For Merlin’s sake, Harry.”

now 2 weeks ago, she did give me 2 groups to listen to. the first one had a really small discography so i listened to all their stuff and texted her telling her i liked them (i genuily did). we did have a small talk about them and that’s it. that was last Tuesday. this weekend, one of her friends invited me to sit with them a little bit when my friends and I were in her shop, and she was mostly on her phone, so i just talked to her friend for a little and then got back to mine. then when her friends left, i did try to open a talk with her, it was brief but there was not much time anyways.

now i did check the second band, like one EP that she prob didn’t even hear but whatever, and idk how should i text her. i’m pretty sure she knows i have feelings at this point but i don’t know about her i only get mixed signals.

Yon glared at Eastern. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

“The fuck you don’t” Eastern said. “I knew Siobhan from years ago. You’re not Siobhan. Did you kill her?”

Yon side eyed Eastern. “What do *you* think, Eastern?” She said.

“No way you could have gotten Siobhan, she was too careful, too smart to get taken by you.” She spat. “Where is she?”

“You’ll never know.” Yon said, smirking. “To anyone who *matters*, I am Siobhan. I know everything about her and can pass any test.” Yon looked thoughtful. “Actually, how did you know I wasn’t her?”

Eastern crossed her arms. “Well for one, she wasn’t an AI.”

“That you knew about.”

“Yon, I *fucked* her, I know she wasn’t an AI.” Nick and Selkirk blinked.

“Hmph. That can be emulated.” Yon said. 

“Your whole vibe is off too.” Eastern continued. “It’s a whole-” she gestured, waggling her hand, “-vibe. Subtle things. You’re not her, even if you’re a damn good simulation.”

“Doesn’t matter anyway.” Yon said, crossing her arms. “I’m here and she isn’t.”

“Just tell me if she’s alive.”

“Nah. I think I’ll let you keep wondering.”

“Yon, ṯ̷̲̾̔e̴̢͌́l̵͘͜l̶̟͉̏ ̴̙͚͐̑m̶̦̎̕ȩ̴̎͗.̷̖͗” Eastern said, startled at her own voice. Melody was right, you did just know how to do it once you could.

“She died last year, it was a Hopper crash as near as we can tell.” Yon said. “We had been watching her a while, thinking she might be a good asset to gain access to Jameson’s underground, and when she died Raaden told me to take over her identity. It wasn’t too hard, really. Just a little bit of body modification and some basic research.” Yon was babbling. 

Eastern’s face darkened. “So. She’s gone then.”

“Y-yes, and we didn’t kill her.” Yon said, rattled. She stood. “I’m getting out of here while I still have the ability. Um’reli you should as well. I don’t know what Raaden sees in these three, but I don’t think they’ll last long.” She quickly left the room.

Um’reli’s ears flicked and she smiled wanly. “Now you’ve done it. Helen will know for sure that you’re a threat.” She shook her head and her ears flattened slightly. “Couldn’t let it go, eh? I know the type. A very… human reaction.” She took a sip of her tea.

“Eastern, was Siobhan an ex?” Nick asked.

“Yes. No. I don’t know, not really?” Eastern’s face was pale, and her eyes looked very wet. “It was mostly just a fling, the throes of passion, and so on and so on. Every time we weren’t in bed we argued.” She sniffed. “But still, I didn’t want her *dead.* I knew something was up the first time we met her. She would have greeted me with something much more vicious than she did. I should have listened to my hunch.” 

Eastern slid over to where Nick was sitting and leaned against him while he watched darkness fall over Hyacinth. Selkirk wordlessly joined them. Um’reli cleared her throat. “So uh, look.” She said, “I’m sure this is a whole lot for you to take in today, and I can’t imagine this is how you thought your day was going to end when it began, but really, Helen is… something else. I’ve never seen anyone so driven. She has a goal and every waking moment is spent working towards that goal.” She put her tea down and stood. “But, one thing you need to keep in mind is that any obstacle that comes up to her goal is… removed.” Um’reli walked to the exit and looked back at them. “Sometimes, the best thing for an obstacle is for it to realize what it is and work to… remove itself.” She waved with her tail and walked out of the door. An unseen hand closed it silently behind her, and they heard a lock click. 

Selkirk leaned over slowly and kissed them both and whispered. “We need to get out of here, *now*.” And slowly went back to where she was. 

Eastern took the cue and kissed Selkirk deeply and turned to Nick and mouthed, “Go check the exit.”

Nick kissed them both and stood and stretched and walked towards the bathroom. As he passed the exit, he reached out with his cybernetics. It was a digital lock, and it was activated. Not only that, but he was able to see the cameras in the room and yes, they were being watched. He entered the toilet and sat down. While he was doing his business he tried probing deeper. As he sat and watched the data go by, he was able to catch a glimpse of the feed for outside the hall. There was one human shaped guard in front of their door, but the path to the roof was otherwise empty. He jumped to another camera and saw that the path towards the elevator and deeper into Hyacinth One was much more heavily guarded. Up and out, that was the only way.

Business finished, Nick stood and washed his hands. As he came out he made like he was strutting towards the girls, and they giggled. He stood over them and dramatically thrust his hips, and as he did so, they heard the whine of a camera shutting down. He thrust again and heard the lock click.

Selkirk had to practically bite down on her hand to stop laughing, and Eastern rolled her eyes. Cameras off, Nick gestured for Eastern to go to the door with him, while Selkirk began to methodically ransack the apartment, looking for anything that was worth taking. He heard her sharp intake of breath and hiss when she was startled by something, but knew better than to stop and investigate. 

In front of the door, Nick gestured to Eastern and pantomimed like he was giving a speech. Eastern nodded, and Nick quickly opened the door.

Y̴͇̕ö̴̤́ṵ̸͑ ̷̨̚w̸̠͗ḭ̸̄l̵̬͗l̵̼̈́ ̵̬̑s̵̠̅l̶̂ͅẹ̷͛e̷̚ͅp̵̘͋.̵̠̀

As soon as she said it, the guard yawned widely, and slumped against the wall, sliding slowly towards the floor. Eastern reached over and took the submachine gun that was slung around his shoulder. Nick stuck his head back into the condo and stage whispered. “Sel! We gotta go!”

She came trotting out with her arms full of packages. “Let’s go.” She said.

They made their way back out to the Hopper pad on top of Houndstooth One and stood there. “So, uh, what was your plan from here, Nick hon?” Eastern said with a lopsided smile. “Don’t get me wrong, I’m glad we’re out of there, and we seem to have done it without getting caught-”

“At least until that guard wakes up.” Selkirk said.

“Yes, that, thanks Sel. But, even with Nanites, I doubt I can *jump off a building*.”

“I swear to my Ancestors, if both if you didn’t have me around, you’d have no idea what to do.” Selkirk said as she rummaged in one of the packages she was carrying. She took out a small black plastic clicker and pressed the button. 

Another black Hopper slid out of the sky and touched down neatly next to them. The door opened, waiting.

“Come on then, let’s get out of here. Every minute we’re here I feel my life slipping away.” Selkirk bounded onto the Hopper with her packages. Eastern was right behind her, and as Nick stepped aboard, he risked a look behind him. The door was shut fast, and there seemed to be nobody after them.

Selkirk had set the Hopper down nearby; the risk of Houndstooth taking over the Hopper while in the air was too high. It was safer to travel on foot. Once on the ground, they hustled away from the Hopper and ran down into the nearest Metro station. Nick scammed them some tickets with his reader and they settled into the seat as they were whisked up arm.

They rode up to Orchid square, the second to last square before the end of Hyacinth. Up here the landscape was decidedly suburban, but it was likely that the CSEs wouldn’t pick up here as their first choice. “Hey, I know a place around here,” Selkirk said. “We can be scarce there for a while.”

Selkirk led them through the evening light of Orchid square, past coffee shops and small family grocery stores. Nick looked around, realizing that it looked a lot like Parvati here. There were only a few cities on Parvati and humanity hadn’t really spread beyond the main continent where Naya Chennai was and even so, things were spread out. Other than the main city, there weren’t even buildings with multiple floors. As Nick was gawking, Sel walked them right down the Main Street of Orchid and stopped at an unimpressive building. Over the door was a sign in Colonic - the language of Sol and the human colonies - and the dotted slashes of K’laxi writing: “K’laxi Expat Club”

“Expat Club?” Eastern said and looked at Selkirk, who flattened her ears. 

“It’s a club for K’laxi who want to… be around more of their kind. These kinds of places are all over human space, but usually you have to… be K’laxi to know about them.” She said. “But this one is more than that. Come in, I haven’t been entirely straight with you.” 

As they stepped in, Nick immediately smelled something unusual. It was woodsy and floral and had an unfamiliar undertone. He wondered if it was a smell that was soothing or familiar to K’laxi. It wasn’t unpleasant, just unfamiliar. Eastern sniffed and noticed it too, but neither of them said anything. Selkirk walked in and went to the K’laxi at the front desk and said something quietly in her language and gestured with her tail and ears. The K’laxi at the desk peered around her at Eastern and Nick and then looked back at Sel who said something more insistently. The front desk K’laxi flattened their ears and sighed and Selkirk turned to them. “Come on, I have auth, you can come in and I can explain… some things.”

Eastern and Nick stepped forward, and approached the desk the K’laxi held up his hand. He was dressed casually, but he seemed to be wearing some kind of emblem on his right shoulder and he was *not* pleased to see them.  “Hands out, palms down please.” His Colonic was quite accented and Nick and to concentrate to understand him. They put their hands out and he stamped their hands with a large rubber stamp. The ink tingled and Nick felt a data transfer. “Visitor passes. As long as the ink is legible, you’re allowed to pass. You cannot go anywhere without Selkirk, so be mindful and do not wander.” 

He turned back to his pad, and Selkirk opened the door beyond him. “Come on. I owe you some explanation.”

They walked down an anonymous hall, and at the end was an elevator. Sel palmed the reader next to it, and when it opened there was an armed K’laxi in a full military uniform standing there, eyeing them. “This is highly irregular.” He said.

“Yeah, well humans are highly irregular. I already gave Mi’leni my report.” Selkirk was sullen. Nick wondered how many time she had to explain the same story to get this far.

The guard stepped aside, and the three of them stepped into the elevator. The guard pressed the door button as well as selecting the floor. Nick felt the elevator descend a few floors and the door opened with a cheerful chime. As they stepped out they looked like they were in The Basement, but this one was different. 

For one, instead of an illegal bazaar, it was set up like an office. Cubicles with consoles and people on pads, generic art on the walls, muted diffused light overhead.

For another, it was nothing but K’laxi. Nick had never seen so many at once before. There must have been more than one hundred here, all busily working on… something. As they walked between the cubes, occasionally one would look up and their ear would flick or their eyes would move to Selkirk, but they said nothing, she said nothing and her expression did not warrant further communication. Eastern noticed that the guard was following them, staying a few respectful steps away, but still, following them. 

At the end of the hall was a row of conference rooms. Selkirk selected the largest one and as they entered, another K’laxi was sitting at the head of the table. Nick was terrible at guessing K’laxi age, but she looked to be older than Selkirk, with blue grey fur. One of her ears was notched, maybe from a fight, and the other had shimmering silver earrings that flashed in the light. She stood and saluted Selkirk K’laxi style, arms crossed, shoulder to shoulder. To Nick and Eastern’s amazement, Sel returned the salute and sat down at the table heavily. She gestured for Nick and Eastern to sit. 

“Major, it is highly irregular for you to come here directly, let alone with two humans, even if they’re ones you’re in a relationship with,” the blue K’laxi said. “This must be as important as you indicated.”

“Major?” Eastern said, shocked, and stared at Selkirk, her eyes wide.

Selkirk’s ears flattened, and her shoulders slumped and she nearly winced at Eastern’s exclamation. “I told you, I owed you an explanation.” She said and turned to the blue K’laxi. “Commander Mi’leni, there’s been a development. Helen Raaden is on Hyacinth and is Empress.”

Mi’leni froze and stared at Selkirk hard. “You are *sure* of this?” She said.

“We had the… unfortunate pleasure of meeting her. She used her Voice on the three of us. She is here, and she *is* Empress.”

Mi’leni said something in her native language that Nick guessed was a swear. “You did the right thing by coming here then. Were you followed?”

“What kind of Discoverer would I be if I was,” Selkirk snapped. “You have eyes and ears all over Hyacinth, you know the answer to that.

“Very well. We are going to have to arrange for your passage off Hyacinth. Your male is from Parvati, correct? We can send you three there.”

Nick’s head snapped up. “What? You’d send us to Parvati?”

“Not directly of course,” she said. “We’d have to make it a journey with multiple legs, and one would have to be K’lax.”

“We can’t leave Hyacinth!” Eastern said, nearly wailing. “All we have, all we know is here.”

Me’leni stared at her, her expressive eyes boring into Eastern. “From what I understand, everything you have is here at this table,” She said. “If you actually met the Empress and escaped from her, then you need to get as far away from her as possible right now.” She looked down at her pad and her ear flicked irritatedly. “We can’t risk docking up here, it’s too conspicuous. You’ll have to get a ship down at the base.”

“This is going way too fast,” Eastern said. “Uh, Commander Mi’leni was it? Can you please give us some time to talk things out before you start booking us a ride on a Starjumper?” 

She stared at Eastern again, not saying anything. As Eastern’s mouth opened to use the Voice she heard *Don’t. She doesn’t know you have us. Selkirk did not tell her that part. You will doom yourselves if you reveal us.*

“How do you know that?” She thought. It was like having a conversation with herself, but the other voice wasn’t hers.

*How long have you three been together? You haven’t been apart the entire time you’ve been with us. Not only that, but you have made love and shared body fluids with both of them. We are in them as much as we are in you. We know.*

Was that how the Nanites were transferred? Eastern didn’t know. There was quite a bit about them she didn’t know. “Fine,” She thought, “I’ll keep your existence quiet.”

*Good. All will become clear in time.*

“It’s late,” Mi’leni said. “You three can sleep here tonight, and tomorrow we’ll arrange passage. Major, your room is big enough, and I don’t think they’ll mind sharing a bed,” she said, her tail swishing and her ears flicking. Selkirk glowered but said nothing. Mi’leni stood and walked out of the room without saying anything else. 

After the door shut, Eastern turned to Selkirk and said simply, “Major??”",10,1736779812.0,HFY,4,0.92,False

Now fast forward I moved places, and I decided to whitening my teeth. Afterwards I couldn’t drink coffee for 24 hours but I did went to the local Nespresso to load up a bunch of new different delicious flavours.

But the next day nearing 18-20 hours I was thinking to myself, why continue again? Why not pull through and stop it now.

So I did, this time I didn’t have to deal with the heavy pressure of society pulling me back. And only with after some explaining to my gf who later supported me I could go on with facing this addiction.

Now it’s only been like 3/4 days. 

I was up early at first but slept a lot during the day.
Tired and I felt like I had to catch up with sleep deprivation.

Next I got a bit more assertive, things that I stayed in for to long now I said goodbye too. 

I’ve got a more calm demeanour not upset so fast and am more in control of my life.

Looking to move there in May to start and build a life but feeling pretty confused about the whole thing. The thing is, I love LA because of its proximity to Hollywood culture and the magic of LA. Nowhere else in the world has there been such a high concentration of creatives that make a living being creative combined with the need to actually be in the city to build community and relationships in the industry. I like the magic of moving there, meeting a showrunner in a coffee shop and suddenly becoming his assistant or the assistant to one of his colleagues. I love the fact it's built upon nature (rip to this now) and many Angelenos are highly active with hiking and surfing and love to garden. It's a beautiful pocket of the world where misfits who have been shunned by their communities as well as smart out of the box thinkers can go and build a life. But with the aftermaths of Covid, strikes, changes in tax incentives and lowered production numbers combined with the wildfires it seems like the LA of community and creativity is gone. Will people leave permanently and settle somewhere else after these fires? How badly will wildfires like Palidades continue to happen as climate change increases drought conditions? Is there a way to rebuild where a tragedy like this won't happen? Has Hollywood literally burned down? Or is there hope that the city will restart and rejuvenate and continue to build its ethos?

I wanted to share a few insights I’ve picked up along the way:

1. **Convenience Is King**
   * Turns out if people need to open an app, they won’t. Making it voice-activated (just speak and it listens) was a game-changer for actually using the AI.
2. **Memory Makes It Personal**
   * Storing previous chats helps the AI “remember” your favorites—like your daily coffee habit—so it can offer suggestions that feel more human than machine.
3. **Feelings Matter**
   * Teaching the AI to detect if your voice sounds stressed or sad allows it to respond more kindly. It still won’t replace human friends, but it’s a nice boost when you’re down.

During this conversation, she told me she did not know it was a date until I told her there. I was a little confused saying that coffee is kinda self implied then apologised on mu end for not communicating that in advance.

She then said that she does not date and told me to continue the conversation on text. On text she told me that she does not want to date in the community as she has heard some negative experiences and she does not want to be part of any gossip. I responded saying that it is a subjective take (in general) and I personally know 2 married couples who met in the community and people gossip on othere regardless of what they do here (I know a few). Also iterated that I respect her choice either way.

She probably thought I was trying to persuade her and then said she was not in a headspace to date and thought the interaction was something else since I have a ""nice, friendly and safe vibe"" (Beats me), something that is rare. I have once again clarified that I was only stating an observation and told her that we can continue being friends as usual.

Well, that was that. She seemed like she was fully aware what I meant back when I asked her out and considering how her reason quickly changed to not take this forward, the answer feels a little canned. Felt like another passive ""anybody but you"" statement for some reason. 

What bugs me is the ""nice, friendly and safe vibe"" statement. Did that just become a liability again? I keep getting that comment in different forms to the point it sometimew feels like it is a dealbreaker.

1i0fc5h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1i0fc5h/why_lcitrulline_larginine_is_better_than_just/,"Why L-Citrulline + L-Arginine is better than just L-Citrulline
","All right, guys, I'll try to make this a quick one. A brilliant guy on Discord—who, by the way, should definitely do his own writing—asked me to write a post about the synergy between L-citrulline and L-arginine.

As you may know, there are multiple studies showing that equal parts L-citrulline and L-arginine actually provide a better effect in terms of sports performance and nitric oxide increase when compared to using just L-arginine or just L-citrulline alone. u/Hinkle\_McKringlebry has talked about it many times. 

Now, we already know that L-citrulline is superior to L-arginine because it bypasses the first-pass metabolism. But if L-citrulline is better than L-arginine, how come combining one part L-arginine with one part L-citrulline is better than just using two parts L-citrulline?

Think about it: you have two parts of a superior compound (L-citrulline) compared to a mix of one part superior (L-citrulline) and one part inferior (L-arginine). Yet somehow, the superior plus inferior combination works better.

This is what we're going to explore today—this unique 1+1=3 synergy and how it actually works.

# Why is L-citrulline superior in the first place

L-arginine is converted into L-citrulline during the synthesis of nitric oxide (NO) by nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and L-citrulline serves as a precursor for the regeneration of L-arginine via separate metabolic pathway we won't need to focus on for this post. While L-arginine supplementation has been thought to improve endothelial function, studies have shown that most orally administered L-arginine is metabolized in the gastrointestinal tract and liver by arginases 1 and 2 before it can reach the kidneys. **L-citrulline is more effective at increasing plasma L-arginine concentrations than L-arginine supplementation because it is not metabolized by arginase and can reach the kidneys where it is converted into L-arginine**

# Combination of L-citrulline and L-arginine is superior

**Oral supplementation with a combination of l-citrulline and l-arginine rapidly increases plasma l-arginine concentration and enhances NO bioavailability**

“l-Citrulline plus l-arginine supplementation caused a more rapid increase in plasma l-arginine levels and marked enhancement of NO bioavailability, including plasma cGMP concentrations, than with dosage with the single amino acids”

**The effects on plasma L-arginine levels of combined oral L-citrulline and L-arginine supplementation in healthy males**

“Oral l-citrulline plus l-arginine supplementation more efficiently increased plasma l-arginine levels than 2 g of l-citrulline or l-arginine, suggesting that oral l-citrulline and l-arginine increase plasma l-arginine levels more effectively in humans when combined.”

**The Effects of Consuming Amino Acids L-Arginine, L-Citrulline (and Their Combination) as a Beverage or Powder, on Athletic and Physical Performance: A Systematic Review**

“Four electronic databases (PubMed, Ebscohost, Science Direct, and Google scholar) were used. An acute dose of 0.075 g/kg of L-Arg or 6 g L-Arg had no significant increase in NO biomarkers and physical performance markers (p > 0.05). Consumption of 2.4 to 6 g/day of L-Cit over 7 to 16 days significantly increased NO level and physical performance markers (p < 0.05). Combined L-Arg and L-Cit supplementation significantly increased circulating NO, improved performance, and reduced feelings of exertion (p < 0.05).”

**The effects on plasma L-arginine levels of combined oral L-citrulline and L-arginine supplementation in healthy males** 

“We investigated the effects of combining 1 g of l-citrulline and 1 g of l-arginine as oral supplementation on plasma l-arginine levels in healthy males. Oral l-citrulline plus l-arginine supplementation more efficiently increased plasma l-arginine levels than 2 g of l-citrulline or l-arginine, suggesting that oral l-citrulline and l-arginine increase plasma l-arginine levels more effectively in humans when combined.”

OK, but what is the reason for that? Why would the combination beat plain old L-citrulline? In the beginning I mentioned arginine’s rate limiting enzymes - arginase 1 and 2, which are responsible for its rapid breakdown. Well **L-citrulline suppresses the activity of arginase.** This allows more of the administered L-arginine to bypass first-pass metabolism and reach circulation. It is actually a strong allosteric inhibitor of arginase. 

“L-Cit acts as a strong allosteric inhibitor, as it has an inhibiting effect on arginase, which metabolises L-Arg to urea and L-ornithine”

“L-citrulline, were shown to inhibit MPEC arginase activity under maximal assay conditions.”

So there you go. L-citrulline inhibits arginase, effectively sparing the L-arginine and you get a nitric oxide increase from both L-cit and L-arg, which is bigger than that from the same quantity L-Cit.

L-arginine is not useless at all as long as you inhibit arginase. 

# Other arginase inhibitors 

There are actually better arginase inhibitors than L-cit.

* L-Norvaline - the most practical one. 250-500mg gets the job done as tested and proven by yours truly with a saliva strip test
* Cocoa Extract - flavonoids in cocoa inhibit arginase. You just have to get a decent high polyphenol extract, not munch on chocolate  
* Berberine - yes, the good old Berberine..what is it that it does not do. Well don’t use it for that, it is a moderate one, just wanted to mention it
* Resveratrol, Cinnamon extract, Agmatine -  probably on the weaker side. The data is not sufficient 
* Piceatannol - the most potent one, but not practical to use, hard to source high Piceatannol supplements
* Chlorogenic acid  - found in coffee. If you source a high % green coffee extract you can have the desired effect.

**Or just take Nitrosigine…**

Nitrosigine stabilizes arginine in its inositol-silicate form, making it less susceptible to arginase activity. This means more arginine is preserved and made available for NO production.

So that is it. Have your L-arginine. It is an awesome nitric oxide booster…just have to inhibit its breakdown. Almost everyone takes L-Cit and L-cit + L-Arg beats just L-cit so no reason to ignore L-arg in sport exercise or general health endeavors. 

EDIT: They tested 1:1 ratio for comparison purposes in these studies. In other studies they actually found 2:1 L-Cit:L-Arg to be the optimal ratio

1i0f9f8,https://i.redd.it/bjeq0kf2vrce1.jpeg,Lattafa Khamrah Qahwa ( Honest review),"After all the hype and constant positive attention from both content creators and the community, I finally caved and blind-bought Khamrah Qahwa. I was initially very skeptical about blind-buying it, but I thought it was worth a shot. Here are my thoughts:

(Keep in mind that I’m not an expert, nor do I have 17 bottles of clones in my collection like half this subreddit, but here’s my take.)

Straight out of the box, it was pleasant, but I could tell it needed some maceration.

I followed the usual method: 10 sprays, then stored it in a cool place. After a month and a half, I can gladly say I’m beyond happy with this perfume.

It’s sweet but not overly so, with a perfect balance between the praline sweetness, spices, and the Qahwa coffee note (more on that later).

The performance is amazing. I never go beyond two sprays because while it smells fantastic, I don’t want to overwhelm someone’s nostrils—everyone has different tastes, after all. Two to three sprays are perfect.

This fragrance is definitely suited for going out, date nights, or special occasions. Personally, I wouldn’t use it as a daily perfume, but that’s just my preference.

I’d rate this fragrance a solid 7/10. It’s great, and I’d definitely recommend it to anyone interested in sweet/spicy fragrances.

Now, here are some things to consider if you’re thinking about buying this perfume:

Khamrah Qahwa was mainly marketed as Khamrah with added coffee, but here’s what I think:

Many content creators have described it as smelling like a sweet latte, which is completely incorrect. Qahwa is a type of coffee consumed in the Middle East, which is spiced with cardamom, cloves, and saffron. This explains why some people say they can’t detect the coffee note—it’s not remotely close to the smell of a typical cup of coffee.

That’s all I have to say about this perfume. It’s great, but it didn’t blow my mind. Nonetheless, I’m happy with it, and it’s definitely going to last a long time. If you’re considering it, I’d recommend it—it’s worth a blind buy.

1i0f6sk,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/master-habit-loop-productivity-success-devesh-sharma,The Power of Habit Stacking: How Small Changes Can Lead to Big Results,"**TL;DR:** Habit stacking connects new habits to existing routines, leveraging the brain’s natural tendency for association. This strategy simplifies behavior change, making new habits easier to stick to. In this post, I’ll break down how habit stacking works, provide examples, and share tips for getting started.  

---

When it comes to building new habits, most people rely on sheer willpower or motivation. But those tend to fade quickly when life gets busy. The real secret to sustainable change lies in creating systems that work *with* your brain, not against it—and that’s exactly where habit stacking comes in.  

### What Is Habit Stacking?  
Habit stacking is a method popularized by James Clear in *Atomic Habits*. It’s a simple yet powerful concept: take a habit you already do regularly and anchor a new habit to it. By doing so, you use the existing routine as a “cue” for the new behavior, embedding it seamlessly into your day.  

Here’s why it works: the brain thrives on patterns and associations. By tying a new action to something familiar, you reduce the mental effort needed to adopt the change. Over time, the stack becomes a natural part of your routine.  

---

### How Habit Stacking Works  
Habit stacking leverages the habit loop—a framework in behavioral psychology that describes how habits form. The loop consists of:  

- **Cue:** A trigger that initiates the behavior.  
- **Routine:** The behavior itself.  
- **Reward:** The positive outcome that reinforces the habit.  

When you stack a habit, the existing routine becomes the cue for the new behavior. For example:  

- *After I pour my morning coffee (cue), I’ll write down my top three priorities for the day (routine).*  

This process strengthens neural pathways, making the new habit easier to maintain.  

---

### Examples of Habit Stacking  
Here are some practical ways to use habit stacking in both personal and professional life:  

- *Personal Life:*  
   - After brushing your teeth, drink a glass of water.  
   - After making your morning coffee, practice gratitude by listing one thing you’re thankful for.  
   - Before going to bed, set out your workout clothes for the next day.  

- *Professional Life:*  
   - After logging into your email, review your top three tasks for the day.  
   - After completing a meeting, take five minutes to summarize key takeaways.  
   - Before leaving your workspace, organize your desk for the next day.  

---

### Why Keystone Habits Matter  
A key part of effective habit stacking is focusing on *keystone habits*. These are habits that, once established, lead to a ripple effect of other positive behaviors. For example:  

- Regular exercise often improves sleep, energy levels, and even eating habits.  
- Meal planning reduces decision fatigue and promotes healthier eating.  
- Daily journaling enhances mindfulness and emotional regulation.  

Keystone habits make your stack more impactful by influencing multiple areas of your life.  

---

### Tips for Successful Habit Stacking  
1. **Start Small:** Focus on one new habit at a time to avoid overwhelming yourself.  
2. **Be Specific:** Clearly define when and where the new habit will happen. Use the formula: *After [existing habit], I will [new habit].*  
3. **Choose Logical Pairings:** Align your new habit with an existing routine that naturally fits.  
4. **Track Progress:** Use a journal or app to monitor your habit stacking journey.  
5. **Celebrate Wins:** Reinforce your new habit with small rewards to keep motivation high.  

---

### Common Challenges and How to Overcome Them  
1. **Overambition:** Trying to stack too many habits at once can lead to burnout. Start with one or two simple habits.  
2. **Inconsistency:** Establish a regular time or place for your stack to make it easier to remember.  
3. **Forgetting:** Set reminders or use visual cues to reinforce the habit loop.  

---

### Why Habit Stacking Works for Leaders and Professionals  
For leaders and professionals juggling packed schedules, habit stacking offers a practical way to make meaningful changes without disrupting your day. By anchoring small, intentional actions to existing routines, you can create momentum that drives better decision-making, clearer priorities, and stronger alignment with your goals.  

It’s not about doing more; it’s about doing smarter.

Theme: Fruit of the Spirit: Faithfulness (2)

Scripture: Phill. 4:11-13; 1 Cor.1:8; Matt.6:22 & John 15:8

Message:

 The Link Between Contentment and Faithfulness

Last week, we learned what the fruit of faithfulness looks like. At its core, faithfulness is unwavering reliability, consistency, devotion, and loyalty. Consider the common marriage vows we hear at weddings: “For better or worse, for richer or poorer, in sickness and health, to love and to cherish, till death do us part.” The idea here is fidelity and perseverance in any and everything; it’s faithfulness regardless of what comes our way.

We also learned that walking in faithfulness to God can only be done by the work of God in us. 1 Corinthians 1:8 (NIV) tells us that the Lord Himself will “keep [us] firm to the end.” As the Holy Spirit works in us, He makes us faithful. He gives us His faithfulness, which allows us to endure and persevere through any and everything.

This brings us to today’s passage, where we see faithfulness as the result of contentment. Something interesting to note here is that Paul uses two different Greek words that we translate as content in Philippians 4:11–12.

Autarkēs (v11): to be self-sufficient. It’s an active term, but it’s also an inward term. This means Paul’s not talking about being self-sufficient in his ability to take care of himself, which would be outward. Instead, it’s this inward feeling of satisfaction he actively lives with.

Chortazesthai (v12): to be full, lacking nothing. It’s the same word we see in Mark 8 after Jesus fed the 5,000 (“the people ate and were satisfied”). It’s the type of feeling we get when we throw down an epic meal, finish a 1,000-piece puzzle, or move into a new house and finally unpack everything.

Now, the interesting thing about chortazesthai is unlike autarkēs, it’s a passive verb, which means we’re the receivers of the work, not the doers. Philippians 4:13 (NIV) tells us: “I can do all this through him who gives me strength.”  The literal word-for-word translation from the Greek: “For all things, I have strength in the One strengthening me.”

Basically, like how a phone plugged into a power source never runs out of battery, when we’re connected to Christ through an intimate relationship, He provides us with this inexhaustible supply of power to be content in all things, which empowers us to walk faithfully with Him. The more we know Him, the more we trust and love Him, and the more we trust and love Him, the more we find satisfaction in Him, and the more we find satisfaction in Him, the more ready and able we are to endure, persevere, and remain consistent and unwavering. That’s the secret of contentment AND faithfulness.

So, how do we ensure we remain faithful? How do we keep ourselves from wavering in our faithfulness to Christ and His work? Matthew 6:22 (NIV) says, “The eye is the lamp of the body. If our eyes are healthy, our whole body will be full of light.” A variety of studies in psychology have shown that intentionally looking at someone’s face and making eye contact increases feelings of love and affection for someone. It ignites and deepens relationships and feelings of gratitude and enjoyment.

So, if we want to remain faithful, keep our eyes on Jesus daily and He will become our treasure. When we behold Jesus consistently, like a spouse who has eyes for no one else, we will remain faithful!

Pause: How does self-controlled living make the teaching about God our Savior attractive?

Practice: In John 15:8 (NIV), Jesus says, “This is to my Father’s glory, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples.” God ordained us to be an agent of transformation in our world, in our culture, in this present age. Not in isolation or seclusion away from the world, but in the places and spaces He has us. Not by fighting a war against culture, but by shining the light of Jesus into our culture! So, this season, be intentional in our workplace to let our good fruit fall onto our coworkers and our bosses. In our homes, in our friend circles, in our gyms, on our teams, and at the restaurants and coffee shops we frequent, let our good fruit and our good works be on display.

Pray: Father, teach us and help us to be more like Your Son, to live an upright, self-controlled, and godly life so we may draw people to You and not away from You. Help us step in with the Spirit and display all the fruit of the Spirit, the results of intimacy with You. Present us with opportunities to walk in the fruit of the Spirit and produce good fruit so others may come to truly understand who You are and how much You love them. Amen.
