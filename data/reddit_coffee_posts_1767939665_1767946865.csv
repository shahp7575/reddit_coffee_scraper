I was scrolling through my phone when I stumbled upon a confession post.

""Truth is, when my parents adopted me, I already knew their real daughter was in the same orphanage as I was. But I didn't dare tell them. I was terrified that I'd lose my new home and be left behind—to be molested by the director.

""Now that Mom and Dad favor me and treat her like trash, the guilt is eating me alive. How can I make it up to her?""

In my last life, I realized the poster was Gabriella Marquez—the one who had been living my life. Devastated, I dragged my crippled right leg out the door to confront her.

But that very night, she crumbled under the pressure and jumped to her death.

Mom and Dad blamed me for everything. They lost it, screaming that I should pay with my life. Only my adopted brother, Vincent Marquez, stood by me.

He took me away to live with him.

But he refused to take me to the shrink, torturing me every single day.

""You drove Gabby to her death. You killed a living, breathing human being with your own hands. You're going to spend the rest of your life paying for it,"" he said.

Eventually, I spiraled into a severe depression and jumped off the building, just like Gabriella had years before.

When I opened my eyes again, I found myself back on the day I found that post.

The netizens thought Gabriella was just fishing for attention to build up an account, leaving all sorts of unhinged comments.

She kept updating the thread.

""Mom and Dad raised me for eighteen years. They couldn't bear to send me away, so they let me stay and live as their daughter's sister.

""The girl and I met when we were five, and we became best friends at the orphanage. But I was scared that if her parents recognized her, they wouldn't want me. So when her parents arrived, I tricked her into playing hide-and-seek and told her to hide.

""I tried to find her later, but she'd already been adopted. Her life has been tough. She's crippled now, skin and bones.

""I heard her foster family was trash; they beat her, screamed at her, and neglected her. They even made her drop out of middle school to fend for herself.

""Meanwhile, I grew up in luxury, having everything I needed. If I so much as sneezed, Mom, Dad, and my brother would anxiously call the family doctor. And I went to a top private high school. I really owe her an apology...""

In my past life, reading those words was what made me snap.

How could I not hate her?

On my first day back with the Marquez family, Mom hugged me and cried, while Dad—usually so stern—had tears in his eyes. My adopted brother Vincent gently stroked my hair.

We should have been happy.

But then Gabriella appeared.

She was wearing a beautiful dress and a diamond necklace I had only ever seen in advertisements—delicate and elegant, like a princess.

I instinctively looked down.

My right leg, crippled from a beating by my foster father, could barely support my malnourished body.

My cheap market clothes smelled weird from overuse, and there was black lint stuck under my fingernails.

Why did a thief get to live like royalty while I struggled just to stay alive?

I started to loathe Gabriella.

She had changed so much that I hadn't realized she was Abby from the orphanage.

After I got lost when I was five, a kind stranger had dropped me off there.

We were always hungry and cold. The director, Phillip Hoffman, was mean, but he was always kind to Abby.

Every time Phillip took Abby away to play ""games"" and brought her back, she would have a bag of snacks.

I wanted snacks too, so I asked her how to play.

She told me, ""The game isn't fun at all. It hurts, and it smells bad. I can share whatever you want to eat with you.

""But don't get clean. If you're clean, Mr. Hoffman might force you to go play games.""

I believed her, so I stayed unkempt every day.

Then, six months later, Abby suddenly wanted to play hide-and-seek with me.

By the time I finally came out of the closet, the night had fallen.

She had been adopted by a wealthy family.

Back then, I was happy for my friend.

But it turned out she had told me to hide simply so she could steal my parents.

When that bloody truth was revealed in my past life, I went insane and attacked Gabriella like a madwoman.

The commotion drew Mom, Dad, and Vincent.

When Mom and Dad learned that Gabriella was the reason I had been separated from them for thirteen years, they couldn't believe their sweet daughter could be so malicious.

Gabriella cried and apologized over and over, ""I'm sorry, Cecilia. I ruined your life. I'm so sorry...""

Not long after, Gabriella jumped from the building and died right in front of me.

Mom and Dad, who had been furious at her deception, broke down the moment they saw her body.

Mom grabbed me by the collar.

""Gabby didn't do anything wrong. She was just terrified of what the director might do to her! She just wanted parents to protect her! Why did you have to expose her and drive her to death?

""Give her back to me!""

Then what had I done to deserve all that suffering?

At the best age of my life, I had been turned into a cripple.

To survive, I rummaged through trash bins for food. I wore the same pair of shoes from spring through winter.

Did dying automatically make her innocent?

I forgot how I left the Marquez's house that day. I only remember Vincent hugging me, separating me from Mom and Dad.

His embrace was as warm as his voice.

""Don't be afraid. You've got me.""

But even his existence was something Gabriella had wished for—she had wanted a brother.

Vincent settled me into his apartment and wiped away my tears.

""You'll live with me from now on.""

But Gabriella's death became my nightmare.

When I woke up screaming in the night, Vincent would hold me tight and soothe me softly.

""Don't be scared, I'm right here.

""I'll find a movie for you to watch. Just distract yourself and stop thinking about those things.""

But scenes of falling in movies only terrified me more.

Vincent then switched to opera.

The soaring voices grated on my nerves.

I could only feel a moment of peace when I gripped Vincent's hand.

I relied on him completely, like he was my lifeline.

Love began to grow amidst the despair.

Yet my mental state continued to deteriorate, so I tried to save myself.

""Take me to see a psychiatrist tomorrow.""

Vincent refused.

He leaned close to my ear and asked gently, ""When Gabby died, her head was smashed open. Have you thought about how much pain she was in?

""Do you remember? She was apologizing to you right before she died. Do you forgive her in your dreams every night?

""Cecilia, you are a murderer.

""You drove Gabby to her death. You killed a living person with your own hands. You have to spend your entire life atoning for it.""

It turned out Vincent didn't take me away because he knew I was innocent. He did it to torture me and avenge Gabriella.

So, this time, I closed the post and pretended I hadn't seen it.

I didn't want to be a sinner again.

I would use the Marquez family's influence to climb up.

Then, I would leave this place forever and live the life I actually wanted.

I was the only person I could rely on.

So, I went downstairs and told Mom, ""I want to go back to school.""

Chapter 2

When I first arrived home, Mom had suggested I transfer to Gabriella's high school.

Back then, I hated her, and I was terrified of getting made fun of for my limp, so I flat-out refused.

But now that I was the one bringing it up, Mom was thrilled.

""That's wonderful. Now Gabby will have company at school.

""And Cece, you've missed so much schoolwork—Vince is a freshman in college, so he can tutor you. Just ask him if you need help.""

Vincent was sitting nearby, watching TV.

At the mention of his name, he looked up.

He still had that gentle look I remembered.

But I wanted nothing to do with him, so I shook my head.

""No need to bother Vince. I can just ask the teachers.""

Vincent lowered his gaze, his lashes dipping slightly. ""Suit yourself.

""Let's eat.""

Gabriella came downstairs and sat stiffly across from me.

As Mom set our plates down, beaming about me going back to school, Gabriella's face went slightly pale.

""It's good that Cece is willing to learn. I'll look out for her at school...""

I cut her off quietly.

""Mom, I can't eat celery. I'm allergic.""

I'd discovered that the hard way while working odd jobs. Once, I was so hungry I ate a customer's leftovers, only to break out in a rash and struggle to breathe.

The terrified shop owner had called an ambulance.

Afterward, he docked my pay for disrupting business.

Mom froze, then hurriedly picked the celery out of my plate. ""That's my fault. I'll remember next time.

""Here, Gabby, you eat it. You love celery.""

But instead of giving it to her directly, she set the piece aside and picked a fresh stalk for Gabriella—as if my plate had contaminated it.

Mom picked up a piece of fish, carefully removing the bones, and teased Gabriella.

""You need a bite of meat after that celery, or you won't get a balanced diet.""

The affection that should have been mine landed on Gabriella instead.

Gabriella watched my reaction cautiously.

I just stuffed my mouth with meat.

The imitation beef I used to eat was soft and lacked any real flavor.

It was nothing like this—firm, tender, and savory.

I ate quickly.

Suddenly, a pork rib was sitting on my plate.

Vincent had put it there.

""The ribs are good, too. Don't just stick to the beef.""

I stiffened, not daring to touch it.

My mind immediately jumped to the worst conclusion. Was there something wrong with the rib?

My nose felt hot.

He was quick, reaching out with a tissue to wipe the blood from my nose.

I panicked, standing up and backing away.

The legs of my chair scraped harshly against the floor, drawing Mom's attention.

I stammered, ""I'm full.""

As I ran upstairs, I heard Vincent's low voice talking to the maid.

""Debra, Cece might be feeling unwell. Prepare something light for her so she feels better.""

That was Vincent—always considerate.

Since my return, even without any real bond between us, he was always checking to see if I was adjusting, if I was warm enough.

That was why, in my previous life, I never suspected that his kindness concealed hatred.

But it didn't matter. This time around, Gabriella wouldn't die.

And I wouldn't have a mental breakdown and jump off a building.

Enrollment happened fast.

By Monday morning, I was set to go to school with Gabriella.

She came to my room holding an orange shopping bag with a backpack inside.

I recognized the brand from my food delivery days—customers wore them. Hermès. Very expensive.

""Cece, your bag is a little small. High school has a heavy workload, so your things won't fit. This one is new. You can use it.""

Since the day I returned, Gabriella had found excuses to give me expensive gifts.

I used to think she was showing off, so I always refused coldly.

Now I realized it was compensation—guilt for stealing my life.

This time, I accepted it without hesitation, already calculating its resale value.

After all, money didn't lie.

Gabriella left, her steps noticeably lighter once she saw that I hadn't rejected her.

I carried the bag downstairs, ready for school.

As I passed the living room, Mom stopped me.

""Cece, you like Hermès, too?

""If you like it, Mom can buy you one, but you can't steal...""

She coughed lightly, softening her tone. ""You can't take Gabby's bag.""

I paused. ""Gabriella gave this to me.""

""Impossible. That limited edition is Gabby's treasure. She barely ever uses it. I once teased her about giving it away, and she cried.""

Gabriella came downstairs just then. Hearing Mom, she hurriedly confirmed it.

""I did give it to Cece.""

Mom didn't understand. ""But don't you love that bag?""

""I...""

Gabriella stammered, afraid to speak the truth.

Her hesitation made Mom misunderstand; she thought I'd coerced her. Mom's face darkened.

Then Vincent walked over.

""Gabby really did give it to her. I heard them upstairs just now.""

Gabriella nodded immediately. ""Exactly. Vince can be my witness.""

But Vincent had been downstairs with Mom the whole time.

Mom sighed. ""You two are just too soft-hearted.

""Fine, let's drop it.""

The matter was lightly brushed aside, leaving me branded a thief.

I clenched my fists and didn't argue.

Mom wouldn't believe me anyway.

They were Gabriella's family. Whatever I did was wrong in their eyes, so why bother speaking?

Later, I found a pawn shop and sold the bag for 200 thousand dollars, an amount I couldn't earn in a lifetime of hard labor.

Being treated as a thief was worth it.

Chapter 3

School wasn't the nightmare I'd pictured.

My classmates knew about my leg and went out of their way to look out for me.

As a result, Gabriella steered clear, pretending we were total strangers.

I had no interest in stirring up drama about who the biological daughter was and who wasn't.

She took the front row; I took the corner.

We stayed in our lanes.

It stayed that way until the final bell. I hung back to ask the teacher a question.

By the time I walked out, Gabriella and the driver were gone, but Vincent was waiting at the gate.

""I told them to go ahead.

""Mom found out about you selling the bag. She's furious.

""Dad got back from his business trip and heard about it, too.

""Just admit you messed up when we get home. I'll speak up for you, and they won't be too hard on you.""

I suddenly couldn't get a read on Vincent.

Given his personality, he should have been echoing Mom and Dad, tearing into me for selling Gabriella's bag. Helping me find a way out was completely out of character.

Had he been reborn, too?

Vincent reached for my backpack, but I instinctively dodged him.

""I get it. But I need to pick up some supplies, so you go ahead, Vince. I can take a cab.""

I turned and hurried away, my limp breaking my stride.

It didn't matter if he had lived this life before or not.

This time around, he could protect Gabriella, and I would walk my own path. We would have nothing to do with each other.

When I got home, the air was thick enough to choke on.

Mom and Dad's expressions were grim. The backpack sat on the coffee table like an accusation.

Gabriella sat primly to the side, looking at me with guilt in her eyes.

I hadn't realized her attempt to make amends would trigger such a mess.

Mom was the first to snap.

""Cecilia, Vince and Gabby lied for you today, so I didn't expose you for stealing earlier. But how could you sell it?

""That is Gabby's most prized possession!

""If I hadn't seen it while shopping and bought it back, Gabby would be heartbroken all over again because of you!""

Dad tossed a debit card onto the table, his voice cold.

""The Marquez family hasn't fallen so low that we need to sell bags. If word got out, people would think we were mistreating our own biological daughter.

""From now on, I'll transfer your allowance to this card. Don't let this happen again. But you need to apologize to Gabby.

""You were in the wrong.""

I didn't know how much money was on the card.

My options were clear—apologize, take the money, and keep the peace.

Or lash out, expose Gabriella, and prove my innocence.

It felt like a lose-lose situation.

So, I made my choice.

""I'm sorry, Gabriella. I shouldn't have stolen your bag and sold it.""

I lowered my head, slumping my shoulders in submission, and picked up the card.

Pride and backbone had disappeared long ago, back when I was poor.

What use was innocence?

When I was starving, unable to pay tuition, or terrified of getting sick... those abstract concepts were trash.

Having money, studying hard, and fighting for my future—that was what mattered.

My attitude was sincere enough, and Mom and Dad's expressions softened.

""As long as you know you were wrong.

""Get along with Gabby from now on; don't let this cause a rift.""

Gabriella looked like she was sitting on pins and needles. She couldn't even meet my gaze before she found an excuse to run upstairs.

Mom grabbed the bag and chased after her.

""Gabby, don't be sad. I checked it; it's not dirty or broken. I'll take you to buy a new one tomorrow to make up for it, okay?""

Her voice faded down the hall.

Calmly, I linked the card to my phone and checked the balance. It was more than I would have made selling the bag.

Not a bad deal.

Once I graduated and got into college, I could move out of the Marquez's house and live on my own.

Vincent blocked my way as I headed to my room.

""You clearly weren't in the wrong. Why did you apologize?

""It was your property; you had the right to do whatever you wanted with it.""

I answered softly, ""Vince, you were the one who told me to admit my mistake in the first place.""

Vincent stiffened, pressing his lips into a tight line.

Just as I was closing the door, he suddenly asked.

""Cece, do you hate me?

""You seem to always be avoiding me.""

""No.""

I just wanted to stay as far away from you as possible.

I shut the door.

Vincent's face disappeared from view.

Because of the bag incident, Gabriella felt even more guilty.

I didn't accuse her or make snide remarks; I simply weaponized that guilt to make her tutor me every day.

I had fallen too far behind in my classes.

I preferred Gabriella to Vincent.

At least when I was with her, I wasn't afraid.

I powered through practice questions day and night.

In the blink of an eye, the SATs were just around the corner.

I wasn't sure what result a year of grinding would yield, but I had to try.

After several sleepless nights, I wasn't in good shape. My head felt heavy and dull.

I held on until the final subject.

Suddenly, blood poured from my nose, and a blinding pain hit me.

I tried to raise my hand to call the proctor.

Then, I collapsed onto the desk and lost consciousness.

I woke up in the hospital.

The proctor had been kind enough to call an ambulance.

The doctor looked at me with the most pity I had ever seen on a human face.

""Where are your parents?""

They were at Gabriella's exam site.

We hadn't been assigned to the same location.

After Dad and Vincent picked me up on the first day, I hadn't seen them since.

""They don't have time to come,"" I said. ""You can tell me, Doc. I'm an adult.""

When I was poor, I was terrified of getting sick. Now I had money, so I thought I had nothing to fear.

But when the doctor said the words ""late-stage leukemia,"" a buzzing sound filled my ears, drowning out everything else.

Chapter 4

I thought about the cheap rental I'd been living in to save cash, the clothes with a pungent smell I'd bought to keep me warm...

A wave of dizziness hit me.

I heard myself ask, ""Is there a cure?""

""It's late-stage. We can try, but a bone marrow transplant is your only real shot. You can start chemotherapy for now. Every extra day you live is a victory.""

I'd seen chemo patients before.

Shaved heads, tubes everywhere, hollow eyes.

It was the kind of sickness where money didn't guarantee survival.

I didn't know how I walked out of that hospital. Instinct took over. I called Mom.

But she wouldn't pick up.

I tried Dad's number.

And he wouldn't pick up either.

Finally, I called Gabriella.

She answered fast. The background was chaotic—laughter, someone complaining about how hard the exams were this year.

Through the noise, I heard my parents.

""Our baby girl is finally free! Let's go! Dad's taking you to your favorite spot to celebrate!""

""Look at the graduation gift Mom got you. It's that clover jewelry set you wanted.""

""Hold on, Mom, Dad. It's a classmate on the phone.""

Gabriella lied.

She walked to a quiet corner before speaking.

""What is it?""

""I'm at the hospital. I can't reach Mom and Dad. Can you tell them...""

""Cece,"" Gabriella cut me off.

""For over a year, I've stepped back for you. Food, clothes, jewelry—you pick first, I take the scraps. I even gave up our weekly family days so they would take you out.

""But today isn't just about exams; it's my coming-of-age party. It matters. Can't you let me have our parents for just one day?

""I know you're supposed to be in the exam hall, so don't lie to me.

""Please, I'm begging you.""

The line went dead.

Gabriella was an orphan. She didn't have a birthday of her own, so she hijacked mine.

I called back, but the connection failed.

Mom and Dad never returned my calls.

It was like they had forgotten I existed.

The tears I'd been holding back finally spilled.

I stared blankly at the four contacts in my phone until a notification popped up.

Gabriella had updated her social media.

She was sitting between Mom and Dad, wearing a birthday crown, beaming with joy.

Vincent stood behind them, his arms resting on our parents' shoulders.

The caption was short, ""Happy Birthday.""

Three hours and fifteen minutes had passed.

They hadn't thought of me for a single second.

Why?

I just wanted to live a decent life.

Why was I the one with the limp? Why was I the one who was sick? Why did I have to suffer while the thief who stole my life got to be happy?

I slammed the medical report onto the pavement.

I hailed a cab and went straight to the restaurant.

I was going to expose Gabriella. I wanted Mom and Dad to see that their ""perfect daughter"" was a despicable thief!

If I couldn't be happy, neither could she.

But I was too late.

They were already gone.

I went to call them again, only to realize Mom had sent a text thirty minutes ago.

""Cece, things got crazy today. We forgot to pick you up. We'll celebrate your birthday tomorrow.

""Dad sent you some money.""

It was a transfer notification for 100 thousand dollars.

Then I saw Vincent's texts.

""Where are you?""

""The proctor said you went to the hospital. Are you sick?""

""Mom and Dad took Gabby to the movies. They probably won't be home tonight. I bought a cake. I'll celebrate with you.""

I switched back to Mom's chat.

I stared at the messages and suddenly started laughing.

They took Gabriella out to have fun and lied to my face about it. Why couldn't they just tell the truth?

They just didn't love me.

The anger that had been building inside me dissolved.

""Forget it,"" I told myself.

I never got what I wanted anyway.

I decided to spend the rest of my life doing exactly what I wanted.

I blocked everyone.

I didn't go back to the villa.

I bought a ticket home.

The family that adopted me years ago lived in a small town.

My adoptive father, Jacob Baldwin, couldn't have children, so he adopted me to save face.

But he was an alcoholic, a gambler, and an abuser.

Whenever things went south, he took it out on me and his wife, Luella Baldwin.

""You eat my food, you drink my water! I'll beat you if I want! You take it!

""Why is a useless thing like you in high school? Get out and earn money! I've fed you for ten years! Pay me back!""

Luella was timid. She swallowed her pride in front of him but acted tough with me.

""Why do you eat so much? Do you know how expensive meat is?

""Go wash the clothes! We adopted you to work, not to be a princess!""

Until one day, Jacob looked at me and said, ""You've grown up to be quite pretty, you wretched girl. Hodge's wife just died, and he needs a new one. He'll take you for 4,000 dollars.""

Hodge was a filthy old man.

I refused to marry him.

That day, Jacob broke my leg. He screamed that even if I was a cripple, I was going to marry Hodge.

Luella grabbed him and held on tight.

""Cece, run!""

I ran.

I lived on the streets for three years before the Marquez family found me.

Relying on memory, I walked through the darkness toward that single-story house.

Jacob was drunk and getting ready to go out and gamble.

Luella was trying to stop him.

From across the yard, I could hear her pathetic pleading. ""That money is for the rent. The landlord comes tomorrow. Can't you wait a few days?""

""Get lost! I earned this money!

""I'll spend it however I want! Stop me again, and I'll beat you to death!""

I heard the sounds of a struggle, followed by Luella's quiet sobbing. Jacob stumbled out of the house.

I followed him silently.

Jacob played cards in an abandoned workshop in town.

To get there, you had to cross the dam.

The further we walked, the quieter it got. My footsteps sounded loud in the silence. Jacob seemed to sense something and turned his head.

I lunged forward and shoved him.

In the blink of an eye, he vanished into the water.

My chest felt tight, but I had never felt such relief.

I had avenged myself for two lifetimes.

I used to be so afraid of consequences. But now that I was dying, I had nothing to fear.

I pulled my hat down low and turned to leave, but a pair of shoes stepped into my vision.

I looked up.

Vincent was standing there.

I understand the risks and am willing to take them to break from the stagnation and damage a dead end job has done to my brain. I did not get into my field but have worked dead end jobs since graduating. Partially circumstances, partially a competitive field, definitely partially my fault for not doing more to prepare for a professional workforce, but that's not what I want to talk about.

First point I am going to make is probably the least objective, but I'll make it anyway. Education should not be solely about employability. Historically it wasn't about employability. Yes, it was for the upper classes, but did anyone ever stop to think why they have this inherent belief that it's morally wrong for poor people to seek education for the sake of betterment or passion? Like it's genuinely backwards and extremely classist, lets start there. 

Second point is that it's uninformed at best and at worst completely out of touch. We do not need a society of computer engineers, or even nurses. The world doesn't run on money, money is the limiting factor that allows us access to resources that would be there regardless. 

The world DOES run on community. We do need electricians, we also need doctors, we also need writers and artists, the lists goes on. The same people who don't believe art is necessary are rotting their brains out watching the fruits of an underfunded, undernourished arts sector and replacing it with morally repugnant political trashtalk and slime videos. We are not machines. We need more than the very basics to thrive, and we are currently seeing society degrade because this is not the view of our politicians.

Third point is that most people who say this are utterly delusional about the job market. Why are we surpised that when we tell everyone to prioritise money over passion and go into the magical high demand fields of the decade, those fields become over saturated to the point of being no more employable than your average arts degree? Was this not the obvious outcome?

And not everyone can become a doctor, electrician, teacher, accountant. That's not how society works. The problem is not your degree, it's the idea that the only positive end goal of that degree is a full time job, when that'd no longer even possible for many supposedly demand fields. And those that are actually in demand are usually abused, overworked and underpaid. 

I'm sick of hearing it. A degree tells an employer that you are more than just a husk of a person and that you can work towards things you put your mind to. You can organise yourself, meet deadlines, and do work that's objectively more difficult than most minimum wage jobs. If you can get a degree you can operate a coffee machine for Christ's sake. At least it's actual worldly experience.

* Secure - email pass authentication is managed by supabase (I never see this info!)
* Data collection - your saved maps, your OpenTopography API key - that's literally it.
* **(Almost) Real time model viewer and editor!**
* Great results - I used a lot of interesting techniques to get the models high quality without the immense size that comes along with terrain data models

Im 22F, healthy weight, healthy diet, and go to the gym regularly! I get my blood tested regularly, no deficiencies. I have one cup of coffee in the morning, sometimes.

For as long as I can remember, Ive been experiencing significant weakness in limbs and sleepiness when my heart rate raises to the point it can be disruptive. This occurs when I'm doing Cardio and when I'm anxious, particularly when I'm driving!!!

I will be riding the exercise bike with a heart rate of 140 and can barely keep my eyes open, along with weakness that affects the rest of my workout, once my heartrate goes to resting I feel normal and normal amount of energy, I am sleepier on the bike than the rest of the day! Actually, sleepier then than I am when I wake up in the morning or go to bed!

More importantly, if I get scared or anxious while driving (I live in Houston 😫) I will start experiencing the same symptoms. I refuse to drive alone to stressful areas for this reason, I don't think I will fall asleep at the wheel (I continue to do Cardio for my full 30 minutes even if i get sleepy) but I am concerned it could affect my response/reaction time! In other heartrate raising situations, even just like interviews, I experience these weakness and exhaustion symptoms. 

All my tests seem to say that I'm healthy, but it really concerns me, especially when I'm driving. I am not entirely sure if its cardiology related, but my raised heartrate seems to be the only link.

If you’re in the **UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, or Bahrain**, this review also highlights regional compatibility, build quality, and what to expect from your espresso *cup profile* with this machine.

[Gaggia Classic E24 UAE Variant with MDF 55 Grinder](https://preview.redd.it/4fdcgy214acg1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=c22764bcff424ffe06e44acfe72b1b2d75426205)

# 🧠 What “Better Espresso” Really Means

Before we dig into the Classic Pro E24, let’s clarify what we mean by **high‑quality espresso**:

* **Sweetness with balance** — not just bitter or sour
* **Dense, long‑lasting crema**
* **Full body with clarity of flavor**
* **Consistency from shot to shot**
* **Ability to extract nuance from different roast profiles**

We’re not talking about fast run‑of‑the‑mill shots; we mean espresso that highlights the complexity of your beans.

[Authentic Italian Espresso](https://preview.redd.it/2p1687h74acg1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=818fb06d4c6f0fb448ccfa09f212b06ecf3729be)

# 🔥 How the Gaggia Classic Pro E24 Achieves It

# 1. Brass Boiler + Brass Brew Group = Stable Shots

The **big differentiator** here is the **lead‑free brass boiler and group head**. Traditional thermoblock machines heat on demand but lack thermal mass, leading to:

* Undershot (sour) espresso when too cool
* Overshot (bitter) espresso when too hot
* Inconsistent flavor between extractions

The Classic Pro E24’s brass system stores and maintains heat more effectively, so when water passes through coffee:

* **Temperature fluctuation is minimized**
* **Extraction stays consistent**
* **Shot sweetness and depth are enhanced**

This is especially noticeable when playing with **medium to lighter roasts**—where temperature precision really matters.

# 2. 58mm Commercial‑Standard Portafilter

This isn’t just about size. The **58mm stainless‑steel portafilter** actually helps quality in two ways:

* **Heat retention:** Keeps temperature steady from the group to the coffee
* **Puck stability:** Supports even water flow and saturation

This leads to:

✔ Reduced channeling  
✔ More even extraction  
✔ More predictable flavor profiles

This is one reason café owners prefer 58mm—Gaggia brought that standard to home brewing here.

# 3. Pump Pressure & Extraction Control

The machine uses a **15‑bar pump** with proper internal regulation. In real‑world results, this translates to:

* True espresso pressure range (close to 9–10 bar during extraction)
* Consistent crema development
* Even extraction across the puck

With proper grind and tamp, you’ll get:

🔹 Viscous, syrupy shots  
🔹 Sweetness up front  
🔹 Balanced brightness and body  
🔹 A clean finish

Instrumentation like pre‑infusion (manual on this machine) further softens puck shock and improves extraction uniformity.

# ☕ Espresso Taste Profile You Can Expect

With fresh coffee and a grinder that can hit **fine espresso dial‑ins**, the Classic Pro E24 consistently produces:

👉 **Sweet and nuanced cups**  
👉 **Aromatic expression from specialty beans**  
👉 **Dense, lasting crema that doesn’t dissipate quickly**  
👉 **Balanced acidity and body—no sharp sourness**

Compared to thermoblock machines, you’ll notice smoother mouthfeel and less bitterness due to more stable juice temperatures during extraction.

https://preview.redd.it/kem53obl4acg1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=2199fad86b7332fd603ec277c524f6e274ca4948

# 🧪 Real‑World Espresso Performance

If you’re switching from capsule or appliance‑grade machines common in the GCC market:

* **Crema:** noticeably thicker and more stable
* **Sweetness:** more defined
* **Balance:** sourness and bitterness heavily reduced
* **Repeatability:** shots are more consistent day to day

Even without PID control, the E24’s thermal mass and group heat retention compensate extremely well—especially with a few warm‑up cycles and temperature surfing.

# 👨‍🔬 Steam Wand Bonus

While this review is about espresso quality, it’s worth noting the **professional two‑hole steam wand** makes milk drinks taste better because:

* Microfoam is finer and more consistent
* Espresso integrates with milk sweetness, not overpowers it
* Cappuccinos and lattes feel richer

# 📍 GCC Considerations: UAE, KSA, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain

* **Voltage:** Models supplied by **Gaggia Arabia** are 230V / 50Hz—perfect for GCC households
* **No adapters/transformers needed**
* **Warranty and support locally backed**

This avoids common pitfalls when importing machines not configured for regional power standards.

# 🧾 Quick Specs (Espresso‑Relevant)

* **Pump:** 15 Bar
* **Boiler:** Lead‑free brass
* **Group:** Brass, commercial heat mass
* **Portafilter:** 58mm stainless steel
* **Beverages:** Espresso, hot water, steam
* **Capacity:** 2.1L removable tank
* **Dimensions:** 23 × 38 × 24 cm
* **Power:** 230V / 50Hz (GCC)

Price starts from **2199 AED** in the GCC.

# 🏁 Final Verdict — Espresso Quality Focused

The **Gaggia Classic Pro E24** is **not a gimmick machine**. It’s a traditional, well‑engineered espresso maker that focuses on:

✅ Stable temperature  
✅ Controlled pressure  
✅ Real extraction physics  
✅ Café‑level flavor expression

If what you care about is **better espresso—not just espresso‑like drinks—this machine delivers.** Especially here in the GCC, with correct voltage and local support, it’s one of the best choices for serious home espresso in **2026**.",1,1767945275.0,GaggiaArabiaCommunity,0,1.0,False

1q820bx,https://www.reddit.com/r/JamieHBrown/comments/1q820bx/what_happens_immediately_upon_entering_a_cold_bath/,🧊 What Happens Immediately Upon Entering A Cold Bath,"When you enter a cold bath in the UK during winter (typically 6°C to 10°C), your body undergoes a ""cold shock response."" 

This is a rapid, survival-based cascade of biochemical and physiological changes that peak within the first 30 to 60 seconds. 

Immediate Biochemical Changes

Catecholamine Surge: The shock triggers the sympathetic nervous system, causing a massive release of norepinephrine (up to 530%) and epinephrine (adrenaline). These prepare your body for ""fight or flight,"" spiking your heart rate and narrowing blood vessels (vasoconstriction).

Dopamine Release: Cold water immersion can increase dopamine levels by up to 250%. Unlike the quick spikes from sugar or caffeine, this rise is gradual and can stay elevated for several hours.

β-Endorphins: Your body releases these natural painkillers to manage the intense thermal stress, which helps alleviate physical pain and improve mood.

Cold Shock Proteins: At a cellular level, proteins like RBM3 are produced to protect cells from damage and may even support brain health. 

Will you feel ""high""?

Yes, many practitioners experience a ""post-plunge high"" or a state of ""alert-calm"". This is not a hallucinogenic high, but a powerful neurochemical shift characterized by: 

Euphoria and Vigor: The combination of elevated dopamine and endorphins often results in an immediate mood lift and a sense of intense well-being.

Heightened Alertness: The surge in norepinephrine creates a state of sharp focus and mental clarity that many describe as feeling more ""alive"" or focused than after drinking coffee.

Stress Resilience: Over time, this ""controlled stress"" trains your brain to remain calm under pressure, which can lead to a more stable, positive mood throughout the day. 

Safety Warning: In winter, UK tap water is cold enough to cause involuntary gasping and hyperventilation. To stay safe, enter slowly, never submerge your head immediately, and always have a ""spotter"" nearby. ",1,1767944002.0,JamieHBrown,1,1.0,False
1q8209b,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q8209b/why_your_laziness_might_actually_be_biological/,"Why your ""laziness"" might actually be biological (and how to fix it)","I used to think discipline was 100% mental. You know, just ""wanting it enough."" If I burnt out at 2 PM or couldn't wake up at 6 AM, I labeled myself lazy. I thought I just needed to push harder. But after tracking my data for the last year, I realized that fighting your own biology is a losing battle. No amount of ""mindset"" can fix a nervous system that is screaming for recovery. I found that ""laziness"" is often just mismanagement of energy, not lack of willpower.

Here is what I learned about the tailored ""biology of discipline"":

1. Your ""Battery"" isn't a metaphor

We often treat our energy like a gas tank that we just refill with coffee. But your body has a ""Recovery State"" (measured by HRV - Heart Rate Variability).

High HRV: Your nervous system is ready for stress. This is when you should schedule deep work, hard workouts, or difficult conversations.

Low HRV: Your body is in ""fight or flight"" or ""repair"" mode. Pushing hard here doesn't build discipline; it builds burnout.

The Fix: Check your resting heart rate and HRV first thing in the morning. If you're in the red, focus on active recovery (walking, breathwork, early sleep) instead of forcing grind. You'll bounce back faster.

2. The Circadian ""Power Window""

Most of us have a specific 3-4 hour window where our focus is biologically peaked. For me, it's 8:00 AM - 11:00 AM. For others (night owls), it might be 8:00 PM. Attempting high-discipline tasks outside your biological window costs 2x the willpower for 0.5x the result.

The Fix: Stop trying to be a ""5 AM person"" if your biology says you're not. Find your peak window and protect it like gold. Do your hardest task then.

3. ""Energy Debt"" is real

If you slept 5 hours, your ""discipline budget"" is cut in half. That's just biology. I used to ignore this. Now, if I have a bad night, I adjust my expectations. I don't try to PR in the gym or write a novel. I aim for maintenance. Consistency > Intensity.

How I track this (and stop guessing) I realized I couldn't ""feel"" these metrics accurately (caffeine masks fatigue). I started using my Apple Watch data to actually see these states.

Sorry for the plug, but I think for most it would be very useful - I built an app called Body Insights to interpret this specific data because the native Health app didn't explain what to do with the numbers. It basically looks at your sleep/HRV and tells you: ""Hey, you're at 40% battery today, maybe skip the HIIT workout"" or ""You're peaked, go do that hard task now."" 

It made me realize that discipline isn't about ignoring your body, it's about listening to it so you can play the long game.

TL;DR: You might not be lazy. You might just be trying to drive a car with no gas. Check your HRV/Recovery, find your circadian peak, and work with your biology, not against it.

What about you guys? Do you notice a specific time of day where your ""willpower"" naturally crashes?",0,1767943995.0,getdisciplined,0,0.33,False

1q81z69,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1q81z69/advice_please_especially_from_women/,"Advice, please, especially from women","Advice Needed:

I matched with a 29-year-old woman who shares many of my interests and is in a similar career field. After exchanging photos, we planned a date. I suggested a fun activity, but she opted for coffee instead. NOT my preferred date, but I acquiesced. I chose a charming café and let her pick the day and time, even adjusting my own prior commitment to accommodate. (I didn’t tell her that though. I just did it.)

Anyway, just today she cancels our date, stating she was invited to do something with a friend (so she’s opting to do that) and suggested we have a FaceTime call instead. This feels dismissive to me, especially since we had two days of back-and-forth texts confirming our plans. 😳  If she were genuinely interested, wouldn't she want to reschedule our in-person meeting, even if she had plans with her friend?

I'm feeling disappointed and hesitant about the FaceTime call, as they don’t feel as engaging. In fact, I’ve done them, and it never works out well. I am a much better human in person. I never used FaceTime even for work or any other reason so it’s not second nature to me. It’s just very 2-dimensional. I have no clue how to even frame myself in the best light… so really not gung-ho on this and debating how to respond.

Advice?? (Not that concerned about physical appearance because I shared about 10 photos with her, all recent, and she still matched with me).

Should I ignore the request (for a FT) and move on, & in the circumstance, would ghosting be perfectly acceptable, or if I respond, how could I word my response? Tbh, I’m a person who believes in commitment, and if I say I’m going to do something and be somewhere, I wouldn’t change it on a whim, even if I had a slightly better offer. So that kind of bugs me as well that apparently this is not the same type of person. Or am I overreacting?

If she genuinely likes me, (or I mean, was mutually interested to see what I was about), shouldn’t she prioritize meeting in person? Like, I would have felt better about it if she had canceled and then expressed asking if we could just move the date to another day or time but canceling and then shifting to just a FaceTime seems like a step down to me. Ladies, especially, am I misreading this situation, or am I spot on? my first instinct was to just be congenial and say fine. Let’s do a FaceTime. But friends and family have advised me not to do that. That she’s changing the terms, calling all the shots, and actually moving me down to peg from an in person date to a simple FaceTime. Even though I was fully prepared to pay for the entire date and it’s not about that. And I was traveling to meet her halfway. It’s not about that either. Just doesn’t feel good. I was generally excited to meet this person because we truly do have a zillion interest in common… But now I’m second-guessing it.

I’d appreciate any insights, especially from women: What does it really mean when someone switches from an in-person date to a FaceTime call? She mentioned being excited to meet me, but her actions seem to suggest otherwise. Am I overthinking this?",2,1767943878.0,dating,10,1.0,False
1q81z40,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepyPastas/comments/1q81z40/look_in_the_box_under_my_bed/,Look in the box under my bed.,"The GPS showed four more hours. I slowly drove up the winding mountain road. Driving my tour bus isn't easy. On some bends, I have to lean forward just to be able to guess whether I'll make it around and if anyone is coming the other way.


I've been driving buses for 45 years, 25 of them tour buses. This was supposed to be my last trip before I could retire.

We set off from Chemnitz at 4 a.m. on Sunday morning. Together with the tour guide, I loaded the passengers and took care of their luggage. We don't need to discuss the average age on these kinds of trips: it's rare to find anyone under 30.


The oldest passenger that day was 95 years old. He was quite fit for his age. We started driving, and I put on a German pop music CD. The passengers always particularly enjoyed that. It wasn't my taste, but thankfully, tastes vary. What's always interesting about a trip like this is when people tell each other their stories. That's how I learned that a hobby hunter and gun enthusiast was sitting right behind me.

The destination was Rome. The trip was supposed to last from Sunday to the following Sunday, so seven days. The plan was to visit various cities in Italy. The youngest passenger on this tour was a 13-year-old boy named Paul, who was on vacation with his grandmother. He was very curious and wanted to know everything: how to open the doors, how to turn on the windshield wipers—he was completely fascinated by everything.

The first eight hours went really well. A stopover with an overnight stay was planned in Verona, after the Alps. But we didn't get that far. It was a rainy April day. I was driving up the Alps when I started having problems with the GPS—probably due to poor reception. It sent me in circles twice, and at some point, I decided to find my own way.

That's when I made a huge mistake. Why did I do that? I drove down a road that turned out to be a dead end.

We were somewhere in the middle of nowhere in the Alps at an altitude of about 1800 meters. We could see a small village kilometers away, but it seemed unreachable. Above this village, we saw a building complex illuminated by a blue light.

We found this strange, but didn't pay much attention to it. I tried to call for help on my cell phone, but of course, I had no signal. I couldn't get a signal with the two-way radio on the bus either. We were about eight kilometers from a normal road.

It was pouring rain, and the passengers were starting to get uncomfortable. I made an announcement with all the information about our current situation, but the discontent only grew. The tour guide was very young and completely unsure of what to do.

It was her first time driving alone. I then said that all the drinks and food were on me until we were out of this situation, and the passengers wouldn't have to pay a cent. Then things calmed down.

Luckily, I had 200 frankfurters, 100 pairs of Vienna sausages, 50 instant noodle cups, and several six-packs of water and orange juice with me, as well as tea and coffee. On such a long trip, I always prefer to pack more rather than less. Of course, there was also beer on board.

I coordinated with the tour guide, and we decided that one of us would head out to the road to get help as soon as it stopped raining.

Night fell, and after I had provided the passengers with food and drinks, I got some suitcases from the luggage compartment so people could put on warm clothes for the night.

It wouldn't be comfortable, but we couldn't find another way to handle it. I kept having the feeling I saw something in the dark. But I thought it was just my imagination. Around 11 p.m., the rain stopped, and the tour guide decided to head towards the road. She got off the bus and set off on the long walk.

We estimated it would take her about two hours to reach the road. However, it could take even longer if she didn't find anyone. I turned off the light to save power so the bus would start in an emergency and the battery wouldn't be dead.

Nothing exciting happened for the next hour, except for the recurring argument about the toilet. I was already dreading having to clean it after the mess.

Every now and then, I had the feeling I saw a figure in the dark. But I forced myself to stay calm. Time passed, and a colorful chorus of various sleeping sounds could be heard. Suddenly, I was startled. Something had run along the windshield. So close that it touched it, leaving a trail of mud.


I thought about what it could be, but couldn't find an answer. I dismissed it as my imagination or guessed that maybe a branch had broken off and grazed the windshield. Or perhaps an animal.

But it was something else. I would never have thought such a thing possible. About half an hour passed without anything else happening. I was just about to close my eyes when the bus was struck by a violent impact from the right side. It threatened to tip over, but just barely managed to right itself.

Panic immediately broke out on the bus. People screamed bloody murder. Everyone looked to the side, but apart from shattered windows, there was nothing to see. After about a minute, there was a second impact. This caused the bus to tip over, slide down the slope about 20 meters, and roll over before coming to rest against a large rock.

Luckily, it was back on its wheels. Screams echoed through the bus; you could hear people crashing against windows, which then shattered.

After the bus came to a stop, I noticed I had a cut on my left arm, but otherwise, I'd gotten off lightly.

Others weren't so lucky. For a second, there was a deafening silence. As if the world had frozen. I turned on the interior light. I saw twisted arms and legs, and people who weren't moving at all.

Fear and despair were palpable. People were panicking, screaming, and desperately trying to escape. I was just about to check how I could help people when I heard a bloodcurdling scream—unlike anything I'd ever heard before.

I looked back when I suddenly saw something black reach through the window. It looked like a crab's claw, only enormous and hairy. The claw grabbed an elderly woman who was lying unconscious across the seats and dragged her outside. For a few seconds, there was a loud cracking sound.

I was shaking all over. My breathing was shallow and rattling as adrenaline surged through my veins like liquid ice. Of the 43 passengers, ten had minor injuries. The rest were either dead, seriously injured, or unconscious. I considered what we should do and called everyone to the front, since the window there was cracked but still closed.

We had to watch as, person by person, they were dragged from the bus and something devoured them. At least that's what we thought, based on the cracking sounds and the pauses afterward. The bus was being crushed from the back like a tube of toothpaste. The shears sliced ​​through the steel as if it were paper. The metal kept squeaking and creaking.

We were desperately trying to figure out what to do when Paul said, ""We have to get out of here! It's going to crush and eat us alive."" Damn it, he was right. We hatched a plan to find a spot on the mountain where we wouldn't be so exposed and would be more protected.

As the last of the seriously injured were dragged from the bus and lost their lives with panicked screams, we seized the opportunity and pried the windshield from its frame. Before we ran out, I remembered I had a flare for air ambulances under the seat. I grabbed it to distract the creature.

We took off running. I lit the flare and threw it toward the creature. The sight made our blood run cold.

It was about ten meters tall and looked like a giant crab on testosterone. It had four arms with claws and six enormous legs. It resembled a tank, designed solely to destroy all life. It had long eyes that protruded from its head.

A stench almost like decay hung in the air. But by the light of the flare, we could see that there was a small cave nearby, about 200 meters away. We ran in that direction.

The creature decided to catch us and ran after us at breakneck speed. Twenty meters from safety, it grabbed us and caught six people.

The older ones couldn't keep up with that pace. We heard screams and then the cracking of bones, which made our blood run cold. We just barely made it into the cave. It wasn't big, but luckily it had a corner, so we were safe from the claws.

Paul took out his backpack and asked if anyone needed bandages. He'd picked up a first-aid kit on the way to the front of the bus. I praised him, and he smiled.

I joked about whether he'd also packed water and sausages. I patted him on the head, and he was pleased. All four of us talked to each other to try and calm our fears. It didn't help much, but it was still more comfortable than the silence. Paul told me that he'd grown up with his grandmother since he'd lost his parents in an accident when he was young. I felt really sorry for him.

He asked if he'd have to go into a children's home if we survived, since his grandmother was now dead and he had no family left. I was just about to offer him some encouragement and tell him I would help him find a loving family when he interrupted me and asked if he could come to me. I said that would be difficult, since I was also alone, without a wife or children, and the authorities didn't like that sort of thing. Suddenly, one of the women with us exclaimed, ""This thing is tearing the cave open!""

And indeed, we could hear the rocks cracking from the unnatural force of its pincers. We started to cry. When the creature was right in front of us, all we could think about was escape. I grabbed Paul, and we ran for our lives. The woman next to us was sliced ​​in two by a pair of pincers. The man who was still in the cave was simply impaled by a foot.

Paul pointed to the bus, and we ran back to him. We started rummaging through the scattered suitcases, some of which were open, looking for anything useful. I didn't find anything worthwhile, just clothes, bathroom supplies, and other junk. Then Paul found a pistol and magazines in one of the suitcases. This gave us both a glimmer of hope. I took it from him and started firing at the beast.

Actually, I wasn't that bad and managed to hit the monster right in the eye. It flinched briefly, but then became more aggressive. It started wildly grabbing at me with its pincers. I barely managed to dodge. I reloaded the pistol and tried to hit it again. But no shot penetrated its hard armor.

I reloaded the weapon once more. However, this was the last magazine. Suddenly, a pincer caught me from the side and sent me flying. I landed on the ground, unable to move. I also lost the pistol during the flight.

This unnatural, murderous figure approached me. I had the impression it was looking forward to devouring me after I had caused it pain. I began to tremble all over. Tears streamed down my face. The creature slowly raised its pincers toward me, intending to grab me. Then suddenly… suddenly, several shots rang out, hitting the creature in the eye.

I looked in the direction of the shots and saw Paul standing there. He had the gun in his hand and shot at this monster. The creature then fled, screaming uncontrollably. I was stunned.

Paul had saved me. Now this 13-year-old boy stood before me, his body trembling, and I could see in his eyes how much he was struggling with the situation. He was still clutching the pistol with both hands. You'd think his childhood was over. After that moment when we were both unable to move, we walked towards each other. Paul hugged me, and neither of us could hold back the tears.

We heard another loud scream, but it sounded far away. I took the gun from Paul and thanked him several times. As we sat there in the cold night, we suddenly heard a helicopter take off from the building complex. Its red flashing lights were also on.

About two hours later, the tour guide arrived, beaming, and shouted that help was on the way. When she saw the scene of the destruction and our condition, she gasped and burst into tears.

She asked what had happened, but the words caught in my throat. She hadn't noticed anything that had happened. After another two hours, as it got light, a police patrol and a tow truck arrived.

Paul and I were questioned for hours. No one believed our story, but no one had the slightest idea what else could have happened. I was treated like a hardened criminal. Luckily, I had put the gun back in the suitcase. Otherwise, I would have been in even more trouble.

I spent days in pretrial detention. Ultimately, all investigations were dropped, and the case was kept secret from the public. Paul and I had to sign a document stating that we were never allowed to talk about that night. If we did, we would have been locked up for years.

The families were told that the bus had plunged down a slope and burned out. That's why there were no bodies. Paul was placed with a family where, thank God, he found happiness. I was also fortunate enough to be able to visit him regularly. We share more than just a friendship. He's my lifesaver.


I wanted to share my story with you because I have a terminal illness and my time is running out. For the past few months, I've tried to find out everything about this incident, but it's been shrouded in secrecy. The only thing I discovered was that there was a research station near this mountain, which was closed shortly after the incident. Apparently, the small village we saw was buried by an avalanche the day after the accident. This station was also destroyed in the avalanche. I realized that this was the building complex we saw that night.

To this day, that night haunts my dreams. Look, if you don't believe me, look in the box under my bed. The combination for the lock is 3974. I've written down everything I've been able to find out inside.



And also, there's a small piece of the monster's claw that broke off when she destroyed the cave. It's as hard as steel, but doesn't seem to be of any artificial origin. I hid it from the police back then because they wouldn't have believed me anyway. Whatever happened that day, I hope the truth comes out someday.",1,1767943871.0,CreepyPastas,0,1.0,False

I was driving up the Alps when I started having problems with the GPS—probably due to poor reception. It sent me in circles twice, and at some point, I decided to find my own way.

That's when I made a huge mistake. Why did I do that? I drove down a road that turned out to be a dead end.

We were somewhere in the middle of nowhere in the Alps at an altitude of about 1800 meters. We could see a small village kilometers away, but it seemed unreachable. Above this village, we saw a building complex illuminated by a blue light.

We found this strange, but didn't pay much attention to it. I tried to call for help on my cell phone, but of course, I had no signal. I couldn't get a signal with the two-way radio on the bus either. We were about eight kilometers from a normal road.

It was pouring rain, and the passengers were starting to get uncomfortable. I made an announcement with all the information about our current situation, but the discontent only grew. The tour guide was very young and completely unsure of what to do.

It was her first time driving alone. I then said that all the drinks and food were on me until we were out of this situation, and the passengers wouldn't have to pay a cent. Then things calmed down.

Luckily, I had 200 frankfurters, 100 pairs of Vienna sausages, 50 instant noodle cups, and several six-packs of water and orange juice with me, as well as tea and coffee. On such a long trip, I always prefer to pack more rather than less. Of course, there was also beer on board.

I coordinated with the tour guide, and we decided that one of us would head out to the road to get help as soon as it stopped raining.

Night fell, and after I had provided the passengers with food and drinks, I got some suitcases from the luggage compartment so people could put on warm clothes for the night.

It wouldn't be comfortable, but we couldn't find another way to handle it. I kept having the feeling I saw something in the dark. But I thought it was just my imagination. Around 11 p.m., the rain stopped, and the tour guide decided to head towards the road. She got off the bus and set off on the long walk.

We estimated it would take her about two hours to reach the road. However, it could take even longer if she didn't find anyone. I turned off the light to save power so the bus would start in an emergency and the battery wouldn't be dead.

Nothing exciting happened for the next hour, except for the recurring argument about the toilet. I was already dreading having to clean it after the mess.

Every now and then, I had the feeling I saw a figure in the dark. But I forced myself to stay calm. Time passed, and a colorful chorus of various sleeping sounds could be heard. Suddenly, I was startled. Something had run along the windshield. So close that it touched it, leaving a trail of mud.


I thought about what it could be, but couldn't find an answer. I dismissed it as my imagination or guessed that maybe a branch had broken off and grazed the windshield. Or perhaps an animal.

But it was something else. I would never have thought such a thing possible. About half an hour passed without anything else happening. I was just about to close my eyes when the bus was struck by a violent impact from the right side. It threatened to tip over, but just barely managed to right itself.

Panic immediately broke out on the bus. People screamed bloody murder. Everyone looked to the side, but apart from shattered windows, there was nothing to see. After about a minute, there was a second impact. This caused the bus to tip over, slide down the slope about 20 meters, and roll over before coming to rest against a large rock.

Luckily, it was back on its wheels. Screams echoed through the bus; you could hear people crashing against windows, which then shattered.

After the bus came to a stop, I noticed I had a cut on my left arm, but otherwise, I'd gotten off lightly.

Others weren't so lucky. For a second, there was a deafening silence. As if the world had frozen. I turned on the interior light. I saw twisted arms and legs, and people who weren't moving at all.

Fear and despair were palpable. People were panicking, screaming, and desperately trying to escape. I was just about to check how I could help people when I heard a bloodcurdling scream—unlike anything I'd ever heard before.

I looked back when I suddenly saw something black reach through the window. It looked like a crab's claw, only enormous and hairy. The claw grabbed an elderly woman who was lying unconscious across the seats and dragged her outside. For a few seconds, there was a loud cracking sound.

I was shaking all over. My breathing was shallow and rattling as adrenaline surged through my veins like liquid ice. Of the 43 passengers, ten had minor injuries. The rest were either dead, seriously injured, or unconscious. I considered what we should do and called everyone to the front, since the window there was cracked but still closed.

We had to watch as, person by person, they were dragged from the bus and something devoured them. At least that's what we thought, based on the cracking sounds and the pauses afterward. The bus was being crushed from the back like a tube of toothpaste. The shears sliced ​​through the steel as if it were paper. The metal kept squeaking and creaking.

We were desperately trying to figure out what to do when Paul said, ""We have to get out of here! It's going to crush and eat us alive."" Damn it, he was right. We hatched a plan to find a spot on the mountain where we wouldn't be so exposed and would be more protected.

As the last of the seriously injured were dragged from the bus and lost their lives with panicked screams, we seized the opportunity and pried the windshield from its frame. Before we ran out, I remembered I had a flare for air ambulances under the seat. I grabbed it to distract the creature.

We took off running. I lit the flare and threw it toward the creature. The sight made our blood run cold.

It was about ten meters tall and looked like a giant crab on testosterone. It had four arms with claws and six enormous legs. It resembled a tank, designed solely to destroy all life. It had long eyes that protruded from its head.

A stench almost like decay hung in the air. But by the light of the flare, we could see that there was a small cave nearby, about 200 meters away. We ran in that direction.

The creature decided to catch us and ran after us at breakneck speed. Twenty meters from safety, it grabbed us and caught six people.

The older ones couldn't keep up with that pace. We heard screams and then the cracking of bones, which made our blood run cold. We just barely made it into the cave. It wasn't big, but luckily it had a corner, so we were safe from the claws.

Paul took out his backpack and asked if anyone needed bandages. He'd picked up a first-aid kit on the way to the front of the bus. I praised him, and he smiled.

I joked about whether he'd also packed water and sausages. I patted him on the head, and he was pleased. All four of us talked to each other to try and calm our fears. It didn't help much, but it was still more comfortable than the silence. Paul told me that he'd grown up with his grandmother since he'd lost his parents in an accident when he was young. I felt really sorry for him.

He asked if he'd have to go into a children's home if we survived, since his grandmother was now dead and he had no family left. I was just about to offer him some encouragement and tell him I would help him find a loving family when he interrupted me and asked if he could come to me. I said that would be difficult, since I was also alone, without a wife or children, and the authorities didn't like that sort of thing. Suddenly, one of the women with us exclaimed, ""This thing is tearing the cave open!""

And indeed, we could hear the rocks cracking from the unnatural force of its pincers. We started to cry. When the creature was right in front of us, all we could think about was escape. I grabbed Paul, and we ran for our lives. The woman next to us was sliced ​​in two by a pair of pincers. The man who was still in the cave was simply impaled by a foot.

Paul pointed to the bus, and we ran back to him. We started rummaging through the scattered suitcases, some of which were open, looking for anything useful. I didn't find anything worthwhile, just clothes, bathroom supplies, and other junk. Then Paul found a pistol and magazines in one of the suitcases. This gave us both a glimmer of hope. I took it from him and started firing at the beast.

Actually, I wasn't that bad and managed to hit the monster right in the eye. It flinched briefly, but then became more aggressive. It started wildly grabbing at me with its pincers. I barely managed to dodge. I reloaded the pistol and tried to hit it again. But no shot penetrated its hard armor.

I reloaded the weapon once more. However, this was the last magazine. Suddenly, a pincer caught me from the side and sent me flying. I landed on the ground, unable to move. I also lost the pistol during the flight.

This unnatural, murderous figure approached me. I had the impression it was looking forward to devouring me after I had caused it pain. I began to tremble all over. Tears streamed down my face. The creature slowly raised its pincers toward me, intending to grab me. Then suddenly… suddenly, several shots rang out, hitting the creature in the eye.

I looked in the direction of the shots and saw Paul standing there. He had the gun in his hand and shot at this monster. The creature then fled, screaming uncontrollably. I was stunned.

Paul had saved me. Now this 13-year-old boy stood before me, his body trembling, and I could see in his eyes how much he was struggling with the situation. He was still clutching the pistol with both hands. You'd think his childhood was over. After that moment when we were both unable to move, we walked towards each other. Paul hugged me, and neither of us could hold back the tears.

We heard another loud scream, but it sounded far away. I took the gun from Paul and thanked him several times. As we sat there in the cold night, we suddenly heard a helicopter take off from the building complex. Its red flashing lights were also on.

About two hours later, the tour guide arrived, beaming, and shouted that help was on the way. When she saw the scene of the destruction and our condition, she gasped and burst into tears.

She asked what had happened, but the words caught in my throat. She hadn't noticed anything that had happened. After another two hours, as it got light, a police patrol and a tow truck arrived.

Paul and I were questioned for hours. No one believed our story, but no one had the slightest idea what else could have happened. I was treated like a hardened criminal. Luckily, I had put the gun back in the suitcase. Otherwise, I would have been in even more trouble.

I spent days in pretrial detention. Ultimately, all investigations were dropped, and the case was kept secret from the public. Paul and I had to sign a document stating that we were never allowed to talk about that night. If we did, we would have been locked up for years.

The families were told that the bus had plunged down a slope and burned out. That's why there were no bodies. Paul was placed with a family where, thank God, he found happiness. I was also fortunate enough to be able to visit him regularly. We share more than just a friendship. He's my lifesaver.


I wanted to share my story with you because I have a terminal illness and my time is running out. For the past few months, I've tried to find out everything about this incident, but it's been shrouded in secrecy. The only thing I discovered was that there was a research station near this mountain, which was closed shortly after the incident. Apparently, the small village we saw was buried by an avalanche the day after the accident. This station was also destroyed in the avalanche. I realized that this was the building complex we saw that night.

To this day, that night haunts my dreams. Look, if you don't believe me, look in the box under my bed. The combination for the lock is 3974. I've written down everything I've been able to find out inside.



And also, there's a small piece of the monster's claw that broke off when she destroyed the cave. It's as hard as steel, but doesn't seem to be of any artificial origin. I hid it from the police back then because they wouldn't have believed me anyway. Whatever happened that day, I hope the truth comes out someday.",1,1767943830.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

Reality vs Expectations,"The following is an article written by Zaluzhny of Ukraine that I thought was very interesting especially coming from someone who is intimately involved in fighting a war at the current moment. It’s a little long but definitely worth a read. 

https://www.liga.net/en/politics/opinion/politics-and-war-reality-vs-expectations?brid=MHyiEpb9646wvTy1xUCZ_A

It was a tough year. We still didn't understand why it was getting harder and harder every day, despite being in a completely different position compared to 2022. Something was wrong. Something had to be seen and foreseen in the future. Something that could change everything, or at least somehow keep things in a situation where anything was still possible.

War in 2023 has changed dramatically. And while its physical nature was completely clear to us, which allowed us to even influence its further development, for example, with a comprehensive approach to UAVs and space reconnaissance, it did not yet seem possible to form a full-fledged strategy for our future behavior.

The dependence and use of economic opportunities and their increasing involvement in the war process as a whole became even more obvious.
Finally, we also realized that it is impossible to constantly be dependent on weapons supplies from Western partners. And not even because sooner or later they will run out of such weapons, but primarily because the weapons themselves will change over time and our partners will no longer have them. Something fundamental was missing in the approach to building a quality strategy.

Finally, after the consequences of the decisions made in the field of mobilization began to cause their disproportionate damage, everything fell into place.

Academic lessons immediately came to mind. Because according to Clausewitz, speaking of war as a continuation of politics by other means, it is implied that strategy cannot have a rational basis until the goals that need to be achieved are clearly defined.

Political goal of the war

The political goal of the war is what answers all questions. And if, according to the same Clausewitz, war is a ""trinity"": the population, the armed forces, and the state administration, then these aspects are three different codes of law, and among these parties, it is the population that is the most sensitive party in terms of supporting war.

Without public support, it is impossible to wage war successfully. Then perhaps the main form of such public support is society's attitude, first of all, to mobilization, which quickly began to fail.
Clausewitz also emphasized: in order to have the support of the population, it is important that the public is well informed, able to distinguish ""right"" from ""wrong"", ""one's own"" from ""others"". Naturally, the support of the population is strongest and most tangible for ""their own"" and ""the right"", that is, national – in practice, it becomes unconditional when they are directly exposed to danger. A danger can be any threat that is perceived as a direct threat to the independence of a state.

So, it is obvious that no matter how much the military command tries to form a military strategy for a certain period, all this will not bring any results without political will, which is precisely formed through a political goal.

Returning to Clausewitz, the basis of his theory is that wars are usually fought for political, not military, goals, and are driven not so much by physical, but primarily by ideological forces.

One evening, I gave the order to pull up all the directive documents that were coming to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, in order to find out what the political goal of the war was. Or, perhaps, we missed something. Because only with the formation of a political goal all subjects of the state will try to reach the outlined line on the horizon. Which can then claim victory. Unfortunately, then we did not miss anything…

It is this term that ultimately makes it possible to see not only what the enemy is doing, but also how to move forward ourselves. It was then that I tried to formulate a political goal for our war, to outline the necessary strategy for achieving it.

Then I prepared a long article that remained on the top shelf of my desk. It was called ""On the political purpose of the war for Ukraine at the end of 2023.""

One of Carl von Clausewitz's most important postulates is true. It is that war is subject to change, and these changes occur in accordance with changes in politics. And indeed, it should be so. Because the changes that occur in the war also require changes on the political and economic fronts.

But the degree of political tension at that time did not allow my conscience to give this article a boost. The internal political situation was already too fragile. But some of its provisions nevertheless formed the basis for the plan of our actions for 2024. Which, unfortunately, remained on paper. Later, another team developed its idea and brought it to life.

Today, as of the end of 2025, the war in Ukraine has been going on for twelfth year. And with absolute certainty, we can say that it is increasingly bearing the hallmarks of a global war. Yes, in terms of the number of its victims, it has not yet reached the global scale, but in terms of the level of global impact and consequences, it is about ready to start its dangerous account.

Confirmation of this, for example, can be an episode from our history, when supposedly strong personalities of the modern world claimed about possible quick solutions and the long-awaited peace.

A peace that has not yet come.

Number one target for Russia

This confirms that Ukraine is in an extremely difficult situation, where a quick peace will definitely only lead to a devastating defeat and loss of independence. However, as time has shown, it was not possible to achieve it.

Now it is interesting isn't this a consequence of Russia's appetites, which may extend beyond Ukraine. Obviously, it is. All, again, due to a misunderstanding of Russia's political goal and the lack of its own political vision, which was presumably based on the possible political goals of global players. But even then, even if such an understanding comes, following the same theory of wars, any delay in war is to the detriment of the one who is attacking. The Russians cannot allow this – then the expected peace in Ukraine without building a new security architecture, at least in Eastern Europe, is simply impossible.

At a time when Western politicians were captive to their own illusions, drawing pink scenarios or playing along with each other, thinking about the reconstruction of Ukraine, and their experts, in unison with their Ukrainian colleagues, were drawing the future elections in Ukraine, the line of combat contact was confidently moving towards Dnipro, and today – towards Zaporizhzhia and Kharkiv. Not many people pay attention to this anymore. Sometimes it seems that even at the front, like a hundred years ago, they are no longer waiting for victory, but for the long-awaited peace. However, the Russian classic of the theory of military art, Svechin, did not think so a hundred years ago. There is something more complicated behind this.

His own story is also interesting. As a tsarist general and hoping to be useful to the communist regime, in 1927 he published the book ""Strategy"", in which he outlined his view of the system of preparing for and waging war by the state. His story can be instructive in our difficult times. Alexander Svechin was arrested and shot in 1938 by the same communists he decided to serve. But now it's not about him, but about the strategy itself and its connection with politics, first of all.

So, trying to find a definition of the political goal of war, we find a rather interesting definition in the aforementioned author: ""Any struggle for one's own interests can only be waged consciously and systematically if its goals are understood.""

This is the first step towards understanding the essence of Russia's actions. The entire subsequent description of events, of course, confirms that, using, first of all, the weakness of the collective West and international institutions, the Russian leadership has formed a goal that is quite understandable not only for the military leadership, and does not concern the resolving of individual territorial claims or the protection of Russian-speaking citizens of Ukraine. Russia is not interested in the Donetsk or Luhansk regions, except for their mobilization potential. Thousands of ""svechinists"" have already joined the ranks of fighters for ""the Russian peace"" and joined him.

Russia's number one target is Ukraine. It is Ukraine, with its subjectivity and independence and all its potential, that should become the gateway to Europe. Is that why it is so difficult today to find an understanding about stopping the war. Of course, following the same author's logic, such goals are not publicly announced, or are fundamentally distorted and announced publicly in order to attract as many supporters as possible.

Therefore, historians will be able to find out in what form the deprivation of Ukraine's sovereignty and the restoration of imperial ambitions were intended when it becomes possible. But the nature of events since the fall of 2021, throughout 2022 and to this day, especially the spread of distrust towards the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the revealed corruption ties of individual members of the National Security and Defense Council, as well as the rhetoric and behavior of the Russian leadership, leave no doubt about Russia's goal: Ukraine must cease to exist as an independent state.

This conclusion is something we, Ukrainians, must remember. Understanding of this conclusion should form the basis for building our own strategy for preserving the state. This strategy should be built on a political goal, which will be determined by the state's top military-political leadership.

Everything, again, lies in the foundations of the science of war. And it says: ""The task of the high military command is to destroy the enemy's fighting forces. The purpose of war is to win a peace that meets the conditions of the policy supported by the state.""

So war is not a goal in itself, waged only by the military, but is waged in order to conclude peace under certain favorable conditions.

A politician, when determining the political goal of war, must take into account positions on the military, social, and economic fronts of the struggle, the capture of which will create favorable conditions for peace negotiations. So, obviously, not only defense on all these fronts is important, but targeted attacks on each such segment of the enemy must bring success, especially in a war of attrition. This needs to be remembered.

Thus, in determining the political goal of the war, it is actually necessary to define the tasks and unite the leadership on the fronts of political, economic, and armed struggle.

Preparations for the invasion

What was Russia doing?

Already having a clearly defined goal of the war, taking into account its own capabilities and the state of our country, under the slogans of ending the war that began in 2014, grossly violating international law, Russia, presumably from mid-2019, is beginning unprecedented preparations for an invasion in Ukraine, deploying troops along our borders and beginning their training.

Strategy is the art of combining preparation for war and conducting operations to achieve its goal. Strategy solves issues related to the use of both the armed forces and all the resources of the country to achieve the ultimate goal. This, by the way, is the first stone that Ukraine's defense is breaking. The strategy must use all the necessary resources. However, can it fully own them?

According to the same Svechin's logic, there are only two types of strategy to achieve this political goal: defeat and/or exhaustion. Humanity has not come up with anything else.

It would seem, why do we need to remember a Russian theorist who has long been forgotten in Ukraine? It is in the context of these two strategies that it is possible to consider the course of our war and, most importantly, to find the only correct strategy for our actions, built on a correctly defined political goal.

So the Russian leadership, which set a political goal for military action, was clearly aware of what was possible for the strategy with the available means and how their policy could influence the change of the situation for better or worse. Presumably, everything was foreseen.

In August 2021, when I became Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Russia's war against Ukraine had been going on for seven years. Although the Armed Forces of Ukraine were undergoing transformation and gaining combat experience, they still had a large number of problems in various areas. The Russian army was rapidly increasing its forces and supplies. The analytical resource Global Firepower Index published a rating in the fall of 2021, according to which the Russian Armed Forces ranked second among the strongest armies in the world after the United States, while the Armed Forces of Ukraine ranked 25th.

Russia increased its military budget year after year, invested resources in the defense-industrial complex, and purchased more and more weapons and equipment. They significantly outnumbered us both in numbers and equipment. Starting in 2019 and for the next three years, Russia's military spending only increased. At the same time, in Ukraine, everything happened the other way around – in 2021, the army was allocated even less money than in the previous year. And although politicians loudly declared that more than 5% of GDP was allocated to the security and defense sector, this is not only about the Armed Forces, it is also about the National Police, the Security Service of Ukraine, the National Guard, and border guards.

Of the 260 billion hryvnias, less than half was for the Ministry of Defense. Funding for the development and procurement of weapons and equipment was not increased; the bulk of the money traditionally went to providing financial support for the military. Because of this, the Armed Forces of Ukraine were in a state of stagnation – there was a lack of finances for development and increasing combat readiness, there was a problem of personnel outflow and understaffing of military units.

The budget of 2022 was adopted by parliament in the conditions of an escalation of the situation and the build-up of Russian troops near the Ukrainian borders. As a result, it grew by only 10% and reached 133 billion hryvnias.

But this is nothing compared to the challenges that awaited Ukraine and the Armed Forces of Ukraine in connection with Russia's full-scale aggression. The future will show that the persistent underfunding of the army has led to the accumulation of a whole series of problems.

As of the end of 2021, the Russian army was 5 times larger than the Ukrainian one, with 4 times more tanks and armored combat vehicles, 3.4 times more artillery, and 4.5 times more attack helicopters. The situation in the Ukrainian Navy was even sadder – we had no aircraft carriers, destroyers, corvettes, or submarines.

As of August 2021, the Armed Forces of Ukraine numbered 250,000 people, of which about 204,000 were military personnel. The size of the Russian army increased from year to year and by that time already amounted to over a million military personnel.

There were only 24 combat brigades in the Armed Forces of Ukraine at the time of my appointment. It's about combined-arms brigades of the Ground Forces, Air Assault Forces, and Marines, which are the basis of the groups for conducting ground operations. From their number, as of August 2021, 12 brigades were already performing combat missions in the East and South of Ukraine. So we had only 12 combat brigades left, which were at training grounds, at permanent deployment points, and which could be sent to fight the enemy during a full-scale aggression.

All this gave Russia every opportunity to use the strategy of defeat to achieve its established political goal. Therefore, in 2021, Russia began to significantly increase the number of troops along the border with Ukraine. And already by August, the configuration of possible invasion directions was emerging. According to intelligence estimates, the existing number of Russian troops near the Ukrainian borders allowed the enemy to create up to six operational groups of troops that could be involved in the invasion. In addition, troops were also accumulating in temporarily occupied Crimea for an offensive in the Tavria and Azov directions.

In general, before the invasion, the Russian offensive group was estimated to consist of at least 102 battalion tactical groups – up to 135 thousand servicemen, 48 operational-tactical missile systems, up to 2 thousand tanks, 5319 armored vehicles, 2 thousand artillery systems, and up to 700 units of MLRS.

Russia had an absolute advantage in the number of air attack and air defense weapons; before the war, it updated its aviation combat equipment and re-equipped it with more modern technology. Intelligence estimates suggest that the enemy could deploy up to 342 operational-tactical aircraft and 187 helicopters for the invasion. In addition, the Russians have created naval groups to conduct operations in the Black and Azov Seas.

This is what the situation looked like at the end of 2021. We were significantly inferior to the enemy in the number of weapons and military equipment, ammunition, and personnel. We, unlike the Russians, had very little modern weapons. At the beginning of 2022, the General Staff conducted calculations that showed that the total need for funds to repel aggression, including for the restoration and replenishment of missile and ammunition stocks, was estimated at hundreds of billions of hryvnias. Which the Armed Forces of Ukraine did not have. It is difficult to say what political goal this state of the most important institution in the country served.

Therefore, the Russian strategy of defeat envisaged clear and definitive military actions that had enough potential to achieve the political goal both by a quick strike on the capital and by strikes in other directions, but in a limited time. At the same time, such potential was only enough to carry out such actions if they were to be successful. A characteristic feature of such a strategy, in addition to the high, but limited allocated potential, is the enemy's lack of strategic reserves, which are not intended to be created and used in the strategy of defeat.

Operational reserves, typical for the military, are part of the groups and remain an allocated potential. Thus, the achievement of the political goal was carried out mainly by military methods, of course, in combination with classic informational and psychological campaigns and actions, and, presumably, special actions aimed at agents and the fifth column were carried out, which were supposed to precede military actions.

However, the situation turned out differently.

Changing the strategy of defeat to a strategy of attrition

Ukraine, which found itself under attack from an enemy that is several times larger in size, economy, population, military budget, and army size, has survived. First of all, thanks to the heroism of Ukrainians, innovations, and parity achieved with the help of allies.

Of course, such a reaction of ours should be part of a political goal. Because it was the unprecedented heroism of the citizens of Ukraine that became the key to victory and should be the result of a stable position on the political front.

Preventing an opponent from implementing their strategy to achieve a political goal is an absolute victory. A victory that, although costs Ukraine the lives of its best citizens and part of its territory, preserved the state and gave it, most importantly, a chance to fight and make peace on its own terms. A chance that we use to this day.

However, from that moment it is necessary to turn to military science. And it once again reminds us that to achieve the same political goal, when the calculation on the strategy of defeat does not come true, the strategy changes to attrition.

As will later become clear, this in no way refutes the determination of the ultimate goals. The whole world, not just us, has already been convinced of this today.

Since April 17, 2022, while the agents and the 5th column in Ukraine were preparing the ground for a new strategy, Russian troops focused their efforts on conducting military operations in the northeastern, eastern, and southern regions, where they were supposed to create conditions for preparing to carry out tasks within the framework of the attrition strategy.

From a military point of view, everything seemed clear. Russian troops, using the remnants of their saved potential, tried not to lose the initiative by delivering increasingly concentrated strikes, and in some areas, for example on the right bank of the Dnipro and in the South, went on the defensive, creating conditions for a protracted war. Wars of attrition. By the end of 2022, such actions continued almost along the entire front line, without significant operational successes, except for the liberation of the Kharkiv region and the right-bank Ukraine.

These actions were mainly the result of our use of the remaining operational stocks and stocks that were received dosed from partners, as well as Russia's partial use of its own limited strategic stocks. The result was our loss of most of the Luhansk region, and the left-bank part of the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions. Objectively, the strategy of defeat has exhausted itself due to the lack of forces and means, as well as strategic reserves on both sides. This, by the way, is another reason for the emergence of positionality in the war. When there are insufficient material reserves and insufficient preparation on both sides, such a war is likely to become a positional one. However, later, under the force of other factors, this is what happened.

Presumably, examining these two theories, it is necessary to conclude that the strategy of attrition, according to military theory, can be used to create the conditions for defeat. Therefore, since the fall of 2022, Ukraine has been trying to create conditions for implementing the strategy of defeat in the following year, 2023.

However, due to the lack of a political goal, preparation continues only in the military direction and covers only strategic deployment and building capacity to solve tasks in 2023. Our reserves are limited by Western aid, the economy does not meet the needs of the front, society is focused on a quick victory in 2023 and is full of inflated expectations and hopes.

It doesn't seem surprising now that Russia's efforts in 2023 to focus on creating a powerful defense, which on the one hand was logical, supposedly serving to repel our probable offensive, and on the other hand, distracted our attention from the main thing, from forming the necessary material reserve for waging a war of attrition. While we were preparing for coffee in Crimea, the end of the war in 2023, and were watching the attempt to capture Bakhmut, Russia was putting the economy on military rails, launching propaganda and changing legislation, building strategic reserves, and dragging us into a war for which, just like in 2022, we were not ready. A war of attrition.

It was in September 2022, when the first drones flew into the territory of Ukraine, and Russian-influenced groups launched a discrediting campaign against the military leadership of Ukraine, that a new era of wars in the history of mankind began. Wars of attrition. By the end of 2023, this strategy was completely honed and perfected. The events of 2024, and especially 2025, despite minor achievements at the front, indicate the absolute effectiveness of such a strategy for Russia in its efforts to achieve its political goal.

What is this strategy of attrition? The definitions given by theorists of military art are very complex. And to understand it, historical analogies are needed. Because the tools and forms of implementation have changed, but the essence has not changed.

""A weak... enemy can be defeated by destroying its armed forces. But the line of least resistance to victory may pass through a certain prolongation of the war, which may lead to the political disintegration of the enemy. A strong and significant state can hardly be overthrown by methods of defeat without exhaustion,"" so say military classics.

They also add: ""A war of attrition is waged mainly at the expense of reserves accumulated in peacetime; foreign orders for urgent replenishment before war can be extremely appropriate. A great power can organize a struggle for attrition solely on the labor of its industry during the war itself. The military industry can develop exclusively at the expense of military orders.""

""Preparations for a war of attrition should focus primarily on the general, proportionate development and improvement of the state's economy, because a weak economy, of course, cannot withstand the severe tests of attrition.""

It is almost impossible to understand these quotes, dated 1927, without drawing an analogy with these days. But it is absolutely true. The too expensive and devastating war must end quickly. This is the main postulate of NATO doctrine: there is no point in fighting a long war, because you have resources and opportunities to inflict more damage.

The main thing to remember is that attrition strategy operations are not so much direct stages of achieving the ultimate military goal as stages of deploying material advantage, which will ultimately deprive the enemy of the prerequisites for successful resistance.

That's the answer to the question of how much it would cost to shoot down the 9000 air targets that Ukraine receives every month. This is precisely the implementation of the strategy of attrition.

However, a war of attrition is also being waged on the political front. Where, as I have already said, the main thing is the people of Ukraine and their ability to resist, through mobilization. And therefore, the path to political disintegration is becoming increasingly obvious.

The decisive blow that Russia may be preparing

As for military actions in a strategy of attrition. Military actions still play an important role in achieving political goals, but are not the main and final phase.

Or imagine the entry of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to the borders in 1991. Will this mean the end of the war? It is certain that this will change the configuration of the front line, which will run along the state border. However, will this end the war when both the economy and the population of Russia are ready to continue it?

And vice versa – with a healthy economy and the right domestic and foreign policies, it is possible to change the configuration of the front, of course, affecting the economy and population of Russia. Therefore, the goal of military actions in the strategy of attrition is not to carry out balanced and coordinated operations aimed at achieving a final goal, but to create conditions under which it is possible to deliver a decisive blow aimed at the collapse of the country on the economic and political fronts simultaneously.

Simply put, the enemy is trying to create social tension, losses in manpower, and excessive expenditure of financial resources by conducting military operations today. Fighting for symbolic geographical and cultural objects, rather than for tracts of land, is most advantageous in such a case. Turning such objects into fortresses only confirms and supports the enemy's strategy.

Perhaps the last thing to add about the strategy of attrition. Indeed, within the framework of the strategy of attrition, all operations are characterized primarily by having a limited purpose. War is not a decisive blow, but a struggle for positions on the military, political, and economic fronts from which, ultimately, this blow could be delivered.

Yes, the strategy of attrition has its own decisive blow. And if the overall strategy of attrition for the enemy is to bring the country to disintegration through military action, political and economic situation, then what is a decisive blow in this situation? If we look back at history, the answer is obvious.

It is a civil war. Yes, this is exactly the decisive blow that Russia systematically achieves by implementing a strategy of attrition.

This war, by the way, in the absence of a unified vision of security at least on the European continent, is possible not only as a result of achieving the political goal, which is implemented by the strategy of attrition, but also, oddly enough, through a ""just peace"", which, without security guarantees and real financial programs, will certainly lead the war with Russia to the next stage – a civil war.

Therefore, it is precisely the future threats and risks that indicate that defining a clear political goal is not only a task for the activities of the armed forces, but also a directive for political preparation the war, which broadly covers issues of economics, domestic and foreign policy. The assessment of the prospects of war should form a single goal that will unite the military, political, and economic fronts.

For example, if we consider the main stages of the development of the military-political and military-strategic situation around Ukraine, we can consider the following options for the political goal:

1. The period from February 2015 to February 2022. The stage of avoiding and preventing war. The political goal of this period should be: avoiding war by preparing armed forces, population, and economy, and taking foreign policy measures to limit Russia's military capabilities.

Among the main practical measures would have been preparing the country for war in all areas. The final practical phase could have been the introduction of martial law and the early deployment of armed forces in threatening areas.

2. The period from February 24, 2022 to December 2023. The stage of using the destruction strategy. The political goal could be: ensuring sustainable peace and preventing the war from spreading to the rest of Ukraine. If that is not possible, prepare for a war of attrition.

3. The period from February 2024 to January 2025. Strategic defense and alliance formation for active action in a strategy of attrition to seek a just peace.

4. The period from January 2025 to August 2025. Strategic defense with the task of preventing Russia from using its military achievements in shaping peace negotiations.

5. From August 2025. Preservation of the state through the maintenance of military, political and economic fronts. Formation of alliances and coalitions around depriving Russia of war capabilities.

What could be the end of the war?

It is a very strange situation when the issue of the end of the war, under the pressure of the next informational pretext, becomes a topic for the another forecasters in Ukraine.

Informational reasons alone are clearly not enough to form an expiration date of the end of the war. The end or cessation of a war, especially a war of attrition, will depend on the totality of achievements or, conversely, losses on the military, economic, and political fronts. Of course, a collapse on one of them can only cause the emergence of prerequisites for its end. However, the stability of the entire structure is completely dependent on the stability and potential of others. For example, so fast predicted peace in Ukraine will raise quite tough questions in Russia about the number of human losses suffered – it will be as difficult to explain as it is to explain corruption in Ukraine today. And it is natural that the situation on the political front in Russia will not allow this without significant concessions or complete defeat on our part. Today it is difficult to say whether the mediators who are trying to draw up scenarios for Ukraine understand this. But the fact that conditions do not get better for Ukraine every time is obvious.

When forming the political goal of war, it is important to remember that war does not always end with the victory of one side and the defeat of the other. This was the case of World War II, but it is a rare exception, because it has almost never happened in human history. The vast majority of wars end with mutual defeat, or with everyone being sure that they have won, or other options.",11,1767943380.0,CredibleDefense,1,0.87,False

A spinning sausage.
A star named me, biting off its middle finger and staring at it.
Glitter, and a murmur.
Dripping spatter, and the maid uniform a woman I don't know left behind.
White and black and yellow and red, soaked in spray.
The blues accelerate.

I line up hot chocolate and a clear broth that tastes like tears; they cool to room temperature—my dignity and my pet doctrine, too.
I hang a damp towel from above, make a circle, and slip my finger-short arm through.

""Why are you tucked inside a parallelogram?""
I can feel how I'm ashamed of my dull daily life,
and the scale tips to one side; ash settles there.
When I walk outside, I feel someone watching.

""Make space.""
From that person's head down to their spine, cracks are sounding.
""Detour and run.""
A house is burning a few centimeters above their skin.

With that heat, I reheat the cooled hot chocolate.
When it reaches a hard simmer, I temper it with cold tears.
I offer it to the spinning sausage,
and even if no one says, ""You're just lukewarm,"" you can tell, right?

I hurried on.
I sing the blues of aging and dump ash over my head. I choke.
I wear asymmetrical clothes, cut into people’s talk mid-sentence, wanting them to hold me in wary regard.
""That's all you can think of, isn't it?""
You know without me saying.

Inside me, the sound of a day ending rang, every day.
The paki kind, and the poki kind.
What remains is different.
Before I can call it change, words die first.

Coffee grounds at the bottom of a cup get pulled into the star and turn gritty.
A version of me, seen from the grounds’ point of view, takes a fighting stance
and tries to set up a box.

Pretending to buy peace, I clench my chipped hand.
""A man who hasn't finished his cleansing is unforgivable.""
Each time I grip, I replay that line.

I raise a middle finger that isn't there, and turn the Marunouchi Building in front of Tokyo Station into a middle finger.
Bound to both defiance and obedience, still not loosened.
I felt a longing for the elevator shaft.
Back when the child I made in play still revered me.
As if back when the blank in my hand wasn’t yet a number, when my breathing still matched,
I support a box that stands upright and moves.
There is no lie there.

Step outside, and everything grows harsh.
I inhale and it rots; the back of my nose hurts.
Walk the road and you get run over.
Even so, it keeps stretching out.

In a wind around ten meters a second, not quite a gale,
my body heat drops to room temperature,
and I crash into a stranger’s towel and mix into its fibers.

I crash into a wind turbine’s blades
and spin until I twist the shaft off.
I make them stop generating first.

Then I come back,
dress an aunt with a well-kept nose in the maid uniform that was left behind,
and listen in silence as she tells me, ""Feel all kinds of love, too,""
while I sink a skin-warm towel into soapy water and make a circle.
The place where fingers are missing rises.
Even though I'm standing.
That day, I was made to stand for three hours, until it went poki.

Commentary


A scale does not tilt by itself. An instruction arrives first: move your weight to the side where ash collects. Reheat cold hot chocolate; stir in tears just before it boils, and the heat settles. The more the heat is regulated, the vaguer what was lost becomes. Dignity and doctrine cool to room temperature. Body heat falls there too. Room temperature is treated as neutral, but it cools at a pace that suits surveillance.

Make a loop with a towel and slide the arm with missing fingers through. The circle is a mold that hides the missing parts, and it makes you notice how ""en"" can mean both a circle and a bond. The voice that says ""Make space"" pretends to measure distance while confirming rank. It follows with ""Detour and run"" while burning a house a few centimeters above the skin. When the crack in the spine is audible, what is being crushed is less the other person than your own place.

Three hours while standing. Wait until poki sounds. Waiting becomes the goal, a drill that teaches posture. For an ending notice, the sound of a bone is enough. Like a spinning sausage, repeating the same rotation, the angles of defiance and obedience both dull. The moment you raise the Marunouchi Building in front of Tokyo Station as a substitute for the missing middle finger, both become borrowed. The difference between paki and poki appears before the break—in the time you are made to wait.

I throw myself into a turbine and twist the shaft off. Even when I move to the side that makes others stop, I choke on ash, my nose aches, my breath rots. So whose room temperature am I protecting by stopping it?
The answer can only be touched outside the circle, outside the bond. The moment I touch it, the place of the missing finger rises again.

1q81t8d,https://i.redd.it/b8rbb3f0z9cg1.jpeg,Is this a roommate power trip? Roommate uses the extra room as her office and controls me or so it feels like.,"Long post, I appreciate you for reading in advance.

I (28F) live in a 3-bedroom, 2-bath apartment in NYC with my roommate (31F). We both wfh. She travels occasionally for work. We split rent and utilities 50/50. She handles most of the utility accounts (electricity, wifi, etc.) because she had already been living in NYC and it was easier for her to transfer them from her previous apartment. I always pay immediately, usually within seconds of a Venmo request, even when she sends multiple bills at once, with no particular monthly pattern (to be fair she seems flexible in how quick I pay her but also I never tried differently so I am not sure if she would actually be understanding if I were ever late lol).

A bit about me: I have severe late-stage keratoconus (eye condition), which limits my vision heavily, and I have a history of trauma from a break-in. I am new to the US, from Africa, don’t really know anyone here. Safety and privacy are very important to me. I am also an extremely laid back person and peace, especially in my home means so much to me. Its why I crossed continents.

How we got the apartment:

We were originally looking for a 2-bedroom, 2-bath, but she found a 3-bedroom that was still within our budget. She wanted the third bedroom for an office/gym/storage and insisted we didn’t need a third roommate. She had more specific location preferences because she lived in NYC already, and wanted to be near a certain train line and closer to her community. I was moving from out of state and more flexible in my requirements besides the stuff that we already matched on so I did not mind at all, so she handled most of the apartment search and moved in about a week before me. I was involved remotely as much as she needed me and agreed throughout, but she did the legwork because she is more rooted in the city and more specific needs.

When I moved in, she already had her office set up in the third bedroom. The first week went well, she was warm and accommodating, letting me use her office temporarily until my desk arrived, offering blankets, and generally being welcoming.

First major incident:

Shortly after I moved in, she left town for about three weeks. Our apartment is new construction, and we were the first tenants. One day, construction workers came into the apartment while I was getting out of the shower because the building staff didn’t know we had moved in. I was alone, and given my trauma history and limited vision, I panicked. Also all the rooms are the same sizes but she had picked the non street facing bedroom. Mine faces the street full on with no shades. Could be PTSD but I fear someone could catch a pattern of the household dynamic from the window. Her traveling for work, me staying by myself etc…

I texted her explaining what happened with the construction workers and that I felt uncomfortable with the barge in and that I was gonna latch the door from inside and would open it for her as soon as she was back if she lets me know. She did not respond. So weeks passed and I kept it latched.

When she came back a couple of weeks later, I opened the door immediately after she texted me. She was furious and yelled at me for locking it. I panicked and said “omg so sorry Didn’t you see my text?” Her response was a dismissive, “Yeah, whatever,” and she rolled her eyes before going back into the her room while I was so asking if she had a good trip. She often reacts this way, shutting down communication without giving me a chance to explain.

Second incident

About a week later, she briefly stepped out for trash disposal i think and the door apparently “locked” behind her. I was in my room during a meeting and heard heavy knocking. I rushed to open it. She accused me of locking her out intentionally and yelled, even though I genuinely had no idea what happened. After this, I decided to withdraw emotionally bc she just didnt seem like a reasonable person to me and mostly communicate via text. I still respond politely to her questions and maintain household cooperation, but I avoid confrontation because she rarely engages in resolution. Its like she makes a declaration and is not interested in anything further.

Day-to-day life

She uses the third bedroom as her permanent office, which shares a wall with my bedroom. I whisper the entire day. Meaning she has a full functional bedroom with a queen sized bed and dresser and also a separate office that she closes the door when she is in. I have a twin sized bed and an office in my tiny bedroom.

I store some of my belongings in the third bedroom (shoes, small items) (she stores even more stuff there) and initially even in the living room. I always text and give it a sec before going in there to grab something and wait until she finishes a meeting if I hear she is in one. Sometimes this makes me late to engagements.

I whisper, and generally minimize my presence in shared spaces so I don’t feel constantly observed. She is always watching me or so it feels like it. The only time she almost sounds friendly is when I dress up to go out. She stares very uncomfortably and asks where i am going. I engage in the nicest way possible but if I ask her back she keeps it vague.

She enforces strict household rules for me (cleaning used coffee cups and tuna cans before recycling, not eating on the couch (that is the only furniture she has in the main space), which means I have to eat in my room too while she eats on her couch watching my TV. notifying about guests) while not always following similar standards herself. For example, she once commented on my bananas catching fruit flies while I was in surgery, but handled hers without issue.

She has off responses to good mornings and hi’s. Sometimes its warm most times its off. It gives me anxiety. She is a clean person I will say although we do not have a strict cleaning program.

I will say I am not as clean as I usually am. i am extremely overcrowded and somehow on autopilot. Sometimes I cook and dont even eat it the next day because I have anxiety to reheat it so i order out. I have done that since moving in. She also is in her bedroom to sleep only. This one time I went to my bathroom to pee and I saw her working from the living room. So she works from the office and also the living room where I have to get a glare when i go to the bathroom too. I buy groceries and dont use them until they go bad because she completely uses the space and I literally dissociate. I have anxiety from when she accused me of shutting the door when she took out the trash so its my way of staying as far as possible. Not people pleasing I promise. Just keeping the peace. My mental health is recovering from extreme grief the past couple of years so I am super careful with my energy. I am also an immigrant and do not have amy reliable social circle. My poor eye sight might make me miss crumbs but never a huge mess.

The thing that set me off is, for the new year I made it a point to reorganize my space. I put some stuff in the living room in order to prepare and rearrange my living room. I have been doing a progressive deep clean and yesterday I finally finished. Removed everything out from the living room and wiped everything down. It finally is a liveable space again. She saw me cleaning too: Today she texts me the attached. The timing is sooo off. Like why are you texting me AFTER i tidied up. Yes I left things in the living room, it was an eyesore but also it was clear what I was doing plus I have less space than her in an apartment I pay the exact same amount for!! Am I crazy?

Apartment context: 

•	The apartment itself is great. My own bathroom, washer/dryer, close to train, fair NYC rent.

	•	Most furniture is mine except for the couch, which she picked, her friends sleep on there when they come.

I don’t want conflict. I just want stability and safety in my own apartment. But the combination of her permanent office, strict rules, dismissive reactions, and constant observation has made daily life tense and uncomfortable.",1,1767943263.0,badroommates,6,1.0,False

Welcome to The Café Apartment - the iconic nine-storey building on Nguyễn Huệ Street in Ho Chi Minh City, the cultural capital of Vietnam. Built in the 1960s, it could have grown old quietly, like hundreds of others.  
  
But one day its fate changed, and it transformed into a vertical ecosystem where every door opens into a small, self-contained world. What makes this house so remarkable?  
  
1. A weathered façade that became its superpower  
  
It doesn’t hide its age. And in an era obsessed with glossy perfection, people are drawn to what feels real. Authenticity became its identity and you can see it in every photograph.  
  
2. Each floor tells its own story, with its own mood  
  
Climbing the stairs feels like turning the pages of a book:  
  
☕ Pờ Coffee - warm quiet, post-war aesthetics and their famous salted coffee.  
🍵 Partea - a tiny English teatime room where time slows down.  
🍜 Madam Quyên - the comforting aroma of Vietnamese home cooking.  
🍩 Dosh - doughnuts that look more like art pieces than desserts.  
  
Between the cafés are workshops, studios, ceramic corners and peaceful creative spaces. Each floor breathes differently, yet together they form a complete atmosphere - a house where you naturally want to linger.  
  
3. An atmosphere that cannot be copied  
  
The corridors lean slightly, the light falls unevenly…You sit down with a cup of coffee and hear: the laughter of students, the rustle of pages, soft music drifting from a neighbouring café.  
  
The Café Apartment isn’t about interior design. It’s about a feeling. And that feeling is what made it iconic.  
  
4. A place where content creates itself  
  
Every wall feels like a postcard. Word of mouth spreads faster than any advertisement: people take photos, return, and bring their friends.  
  
This place became its own media channel long before the term became fashionable.  
  
👉 A Purring Insight from Your Chief Purr-ologist:  transforming an old residential building into a vertical marketplace shows how authenticity can generate more traffic than any modern shopping centre: low rents for small businesses + creative individuality = a tourist magnet without massive investment.

1q81q3z,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhR4Dating/comments/1q81q3z/30_m4f_running_hiking_dates_quezon_city/,30 [M4F] Running & Hiking Dates - Quezon City,"I’ll give this one last shot.

Posting one last time in the hopes to find the right match and not ghosted. I’ve connected with some great people through here, but the timing or connection hasn’t always worked out. 

If you haven’t read this entire post, you’re not emotionally ready for what I’m looking for, or you’re just moving on to the next profile, please don’t waste my time. 

I’m hoping to meet someone who stays active, has self-assurance, maintains a healthy weight, and lives substance-free. I’d also like to avoid situations where someone is still recovering from a recent relationship/situationships, as I’m beyond the age where I want to be a transitional person for someone. 

It would be helpful if we could share pictures right away to gauge whether there’s physical chemistry before spending a lot of time getting to know each other. 

Anyways, here’s my story:

Once upon a time, there was a tall, nerd, and not-much attractive guy *pero pwede na* who woke up one morning, looked at the sky, and thought, ""Well, this sucks."" He knew there was only one solution - to turn to the all-knowing oracle of modern dating: T̶i̶n̶d̶e̶r̶ Reddit lol.

With his trusty cup of sea salt coffee in hand, he set out to find someone who shared his thirst for knowledge, someone who could keep up with his quirks, and someone who he could eventually take on 'friendly' and ‘wholesome’ dates (whatever that means). He wasn't in a rush to jump into anything too serious too soon, but he knew that someday, he wanted to find someone he could build a meaningful and caring partnership.

So if you’re into third wave coffee, perpetual curiosity, and the full spectrum of nerdy pursuits, this particular vertical human might be worth your time. Dating really does feel like job hunting sometimes, doesn’t it? LOL! You either get guys who hasn’t moved on with their exes, who sends nsfw stuff right away or you get a friendly one so I figured why not lean into the absurdity and write this like a bloody resume. The joke entertained me, at least.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

##About me

An old soul as older people I spoke with would say, into small business and investments, 2nd year law student (took a LOA atm), can drive a fucking 10 wheeler truck lol (/s towards people looking for someone with wheels), no ex-cheating issues or sabit, can provide a certificate of no jowa (kahit wala naman talagang ganon haha). Last relationship (6 years) was 3 years ago and dated someone last year but didn’t worked out.

- I'm 5'9"", physically fit and active, resides in QC. I would say that average level attractive yet clean and very hygienic

- I'm an INTJ-T Arch, Aries, if you’re into MBTI and believes in that people only have 12 personalities.

- Loves to read history, finance and self-help books not because I’m smart rich but I believe about continous learning and motivate myself along the way.

-  I'm the kind of person who doesn't follow the herd blindly, even if it means standing alone in a field of conformity. My principles are like a compass, always pointing me in the right direction, even if it's not the most popular route. In short, I'm not afraid to swim against the current, as long as it's in line with my beliefs.

-  You could say that my communication style is like a triple-layered cake: serious, meaningful, and sprinkled with a healthy dose of humor. Sure, I may come off as really awkward at times, but that's just my way of keeping things interesting. After all, who wants a bland and flavorless conversation when you can have a deliciously complex one? So, if you're looking for someone who can engage in a thoughtful discussion, crack a few jokes, and still leave you with something to ponder, then look no further.

- I'm what you might call a clean freak with a creative streak. As someone who's a bit OC (okay, maybe more than a bit), I can't stand to see a messy or cluttered home. But don't worry, I'm not the type to wait around for someone else to do the dirty work. I take pride in noticing when something needs to be done and taking care of it without being asked - it's like a satisfying little victory every time. And when it comes to interior design and home decor, I'm practically a pro. I'm always on the hunt for the latest and greatest tools and gadgets to keep things looking fresh and stylish. So if you're looking for someone to spruce up your space and keep things sparkling clean, I'm your go-to guy.

- I'm not in the business of putting people down - unless we're talking about the volume on the stereo (badum-tss!). But seriously, I believe in treating others with kindness and respect, even when it's not the easiest thing to do. After all, life is hard enough without having to deal with someone else's negativity. So let's lift each other up instead of tearing each other down, shall we?

- I set long-term feasible goals and actively pursue them.

##Here's a list of my favorites:
Movies/Series | Music | Places | Activities | Books
:--|:--:|:--:|:--:|--:
Godfather | Radiohead | Paris | Cycling | The Daily Stoic by Ryan Holiday
Sherlock | Eraserheads | Coffee Shops | Painting | How to Win Friends & Influence People
Castaway | Nirvana  | Cebu | Muay Thai | Meditation s by Marcus Aurelius
Forrest Gump | Ebe Dancel | Japan | Scuba/Freediving | Start with Why by Simon Sinek
Homeland | Urbandub | Rome | Piano | Atomic Habits by James Clear
Before Sunset | Frederic Chopin | Canada | Running | How to think like a Roman Emperor
The Office | Eminem | New York | Cooking | Letters from Stoic
Big Bang Theory | John Mayer | Maldives | Film & Photography | 48 Laws of Power
Breaking Bad | Elton John | Marrakesh | Badminton | The Intelligent Investor

##Pros:

- Respoņsible (Good credit score, no debts, no criminal records, and self-reliant)

- Curious type of person, who's ready to listen and craves to learn a lot of things

- Doesn't do drugs and is not a heavy drinker/alcoholic.

- Respects your views and accept healthy criticism. Respects personal space and time

- Actually appreciating the things you'll do for me, and showing it. If you cooked a big dinner, saying thank you is nice. Doing the dishes and cleaning the kitchen is even nicer, and in my opinion, should be the norm. The cook doesn't clean. If someone does something for me, I'll show them that their effort was appreciated instead of just accepting their generosity and then running off back to whatever I'm doing.

- Accepts respònsibility or has accountability for one's own action and does not try to blame everything or everyone else. 

- No addiction/s, drugs, tattoos and not into online games

##My preference:

- Someone who has a strong passion for accurate and comprehensive learning, maintains a normal BMI, physically active and is beautiful and easy on the eyes - I believe that beauty comes in all shapes and sizes (no offense intended towards plus-size women!).

- High standards for what she wants and is not afraid to communicate it.

- Craves knowledge too. Love and isn't afraid to try new things

- Passionate and proud about something they've been working on/have done/are planning to do

- Confident about what they want but isn't in-your-face about it.

—and ideally, someone who enjoys staying active too, so we can share more than just deep conversations—maybe runs, hikes, or muay thai sessions together. Shared passions make connections even stronger.

Let's take a break from stressing over the mundane and focus on the important stuff - like what will make us happy for the rest of our lives! Share your thoughtys on how we can achieve that and let's get this happiness train moving! Send me your pic and I'll send mine to get started.",4,1767942942.0,PhR4Dating,5,0.83,False
1q81q2x,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1q81q2x/my_sister_left_me_the_night_my_partner_died_aitah/,"My sister left me the night my partner died, AITAH?","Okay, here it goes.My partner had cancer, and was in the hospice unit at the hospital. I live quite far from my family, but my sister took a plane up and visited. Even though he was in the hospice unit, he was still up and walking around and drinking coffee and ordering takeout, so its not like we thought he was going to die while she was here. She arrived on a Thursday, and left on the Wednesday.

Sunday he woke up, texted me he was feeling great. We actually had his celebration of life planned for that day because he wanted to be able to attend, but by the time I got to the hospital he went downhill. In my brain, there was so many downhills but they always went back to a uphill after so I didnt even feel that worried. I wasn't staying with him at the hospital because I had a toddler around 2 at the time, so I rented a small short-term apartment only a 5 minute walk away. 

Well that day, my sister who also has a little one around 3 was there, and we decided to go on a long drive so the kids will sleep. They ended up sleeping for 3 hours. Ill forever regret leaving the hospital this day for that nap, and not getting her to nap in the hospital room like I usually do. 

As we were heading back, my sister in law called me that I needed to be there. An hour after I got back (I think, its all blurry), he died. For me my heart just broke. My sister obviously wasn't expecting this, so I assume she was in shock from it all. She was in the hallway when it happened. I didnt stay very long at the hospital after this. We honestly took our kids for a quick walk around the block because they were cooped up all morning, then had a 3 hour nap so we needed to get energy out so they would go to sleep. I just remember barely being able to talk, and just staring straight and to me it felt like I could barely move. 

On our way back to the apartment, I told my sister that all I want is to go home. My actual home is an hour drive from where I was staying. She said no she was to tired to drive, she could take us tomorrow. I dont have my license. We got to the place I was renting, and my sister made some macaroni that I had bought, and i just remember her coming in to the room so many times asking me simple questions like, where is the pot, I dont know how to turn the oven on, I dont know where the dishes are kept. These are definitely simple questions to answer, but from my perspective I was just sitting on the floor with my toddler staring straight and could barely move, and was just thinking why cant she just figure this out herself. 

So I think at this moment we both started getting annoyed with each other. My sister made the macaroni, then got her kid ready for bed. I was still on the floor staring straight and couldn't move. Once she got her kid ready she came back in the room and told me shes going to turn off the light and put her to sleep. We were all sleeping in this one room, I gave her the bed and I was sleeping on the floor. I told my sister that I need 10 minutes before we turn the light out to get my toddler ready for bed. 

My sister was getting frustrated at this, and I told her that this is the place I rented, if she cant wait 10 minutes she can go stay somewhere else. My sister flipped the light out anyways. I flipped it back on. She asked me why I was such a bitch. In this time my sister went to the bed and layed down, as we were in that argument. After she called me a bitch, I whispered under my breath I wish it was her. 

I do not want my sister to die, I said this in the heat of the moment when I already was in a state of not being able to handle emotions, and I later texted her I said things I didnt mean. But this is horrible to admit but I dont feel that bad about it, because how I really feel inside is a wish it was anyone else but him. After the loss of a loved one, everyone goes and hugs there family or there partner. He was my family and my partner to go and hug. And he just wasn't there.

So after I whispered that. I went to the bathroom with my toddler and brushed her teeth and I came back to the room, and my sister had got out of bed and packed her things. She did the silent treatment from then on. 

I said things like I cant believe you are going to leave me in a moment like this. My heart just broke and your just going to leave me. If you walk out, you are not my sister anymore. She didnt say anything, she packed her bags, and she left (with her kid).The only thing in this scenerio i wish I didnt say, was I wish it was her. Everything else I feel like I had a right to be angry and to be upset.

This argument was on Sunday night, she didnt have her flight to go home until Wednesday. I moved away with my partner, so I have no family where I am, she was the only person I had. And she left. She didnt message me until she was back home. But since returning home, she has told my other family members that I forced her to leave. So I just feel she doesnt understand what has actually happened, so obviously has no remorse for her actions that night.

Okay, I know she was in shock probably, but in my head I wish she could've looked into my shoes and put her feelings aside for the night. I just wish she never made the trip down in the first place that weekend, and then our relationship would have still been amazing and she would have been the person I needed by my side. 

I understand I said a terrible thing, but in my head in the months that have followed this, I just have flashbacks of us when we were a kid (we are very close in age). Sleeping together every night. Sharing clothes. Annoying each other. All of the sibling things. And before this happened, even just a few days prior I always told people that she was my person. I thought my sister would always be my person, but with the flashbacks in my head to when we were younger, i just can't even in my head believe that she would just abandon me in this moment. In my head, I feel like this is something that is never forgivable. This might be one of the hardest moments in my life, and she just walked away from me. 

In my head I feel, why would I want to be around someone in my happy moments, when they have already shown and proven what they will do in my worst moment.Okay, I think thats it. Sorry for this long rant but this whole situation torments me. AITAH or was she being completely reasonable and protecting her own sanity, and this is just something I will have to get over it. Thanks to anyone who read this all. 

Also Ill add he died at the end of September. After she arrived back at home, in the weeks that followed she would text me about random things not related to what happened or my partner dieing. I sent her a message that I am not ready to continue the same relationship with her. We have since communicated a few times over text sharing pictures of our children, and we talked about Christmas ideas for our parents we could collaborate on. My sister and I use to call for probably an hour almost every day, but havent had one phone call since. 

Edit to add: another small detail i forgot to mention is before this argument, we had talked about her pushing back her flight by a week and helping me get some things sorted (her idea). Obviously this didn't happen.",0,1767942938.0,AITAH,5,0.5,False

It’s my first time properly posting on reddit, so I’m a bit nervous here, but I’ve seen others shooting their shots so I figured I should too. And truly, isolation becomes overwhelming sometimes. So, this is going to be a bit lengthy, and I apologise for that in advance. 

I’m a non-binary afab person, based in North Brisbane (Moreton Bay Region) who is looking for friends. I’m 25, and honestly, I’ve never been good at the ‘making friends’ thing. I usually would put it down to being neurodivergent, plus sized, and otherwise a little dysfunctional, but I have a lot of love and joy to share too.

For a bit of context on me, I’m kind of your regular ADHD hobby hopper, but I love a good diy or craft. Anything artsy, really. 
Music recommendations? Hit me with them. Baking nights and board/video games? Love it. Dungeons and Dragons? Absolutely. A movie marathon of truly awful B and C grade shark films? You’re my person.

I’m an empathetic, witchy, hippy, non conforming but fairly femme enjoyer of life. I wanna hear about your hyper fixations, fun facts, and biggest pet peeves. Connection and communication is a must for me in friendships; let’s maybe 💨garden💨 and have ‘Deep and Meaningful’s about everything and absolutely nothing? 

Other fun facts about me: 
- coffee is one of my favourite things 
- I have two cats and a dog 
- I can give you rune readings if you’re down for the emotions lol

1q81oh8,https://www.reddit.com/r/DigtalDDTcommunity/comments/1q81oh8/the_not_for_sale_boundary/,🎨 THE NOT FOR SALE BOUNDARY,"I love the creativity in this community, but we need to talk about where Fan Art ends and Identity Theft begins. To keep my brand clean and my face off of random products, here are the Identity Laws:

• The No Merch Zone: I want to be 100% clear I do not sell merch. I have no plans to sell merch. If you see a T-shirt, a hoodie, or a coffee mug with my face or name on it, I didn't make it. Someone is trying to use my brand to line their own pockets with your hard-earned cash. Don’t buy it.

• Fan Art vs. Fakes: I love seeing your art and edits! Please keep making them. But if you're making a Fan Page, you must state FAN ACCOUNT clearly in the bio. If your page looks like it’s trying to be my official backup or an ""official shop,"" we’re going to have a problem.

• The No Endorsement Rule: You do not have permission to use my face, voice, or name to sell anything. If you see me in an ad for a supplement, a game, or a get rich quick scheme, it’s a fake. If I’m not talking about it on this main channel, I don't endorse it.

TL;DR: I don’t sell merch and I don't do random ads. If you see my face on a product, it’s a scam. Protect your wallet!

Мяу, всем «владельцам заводов, газет, пароходов»! Сегодня я, кот Баюн - главный мурлыкетолог WebSEOMarket  уселся в мягкое кресло, хлопнул подушку, налил себе чашечку жасминового чая… и решил рассказать Вам одну историю.



Историю о доме. Не простом, а таком, что живёт собственной жизнью, дышит ароматом кофе и гудит разговорами молодых мечтателей. Добро пожаловать в The Café Apartment - знаменитый 9-этажный дом на Nguyễn Huệ Street в Хошимине - столице Вьетнама. Построенный в 1960-х, он мог бы тихо стареть, как сотни других. 



Но однажды его судьба изменилась и дом превратился в вертикальную экосистему, где каждая дверь ведёт в свой маленький мир. Что делает этот дом особенным?



1. Ветхий фасад, который стал суперсилой. Он не скрывает возраст. В эпоху глянца люди тянутся именно к подлинности. Аутентичность стала его брендом и это видно на каждом фото.



2. На каждом этаже своя история и своё настроение. Идёшь по лестнице  и будто листаешь книгу:



☕️ Pờ Coffee - тёплая тишина, поствоенная эстетика и солёный кофе.

🍵 Partea - комната английского чаепития, где время течёт медленнее.

🍜 Madam Quyên - тепло домашней вьетнамской кухни.

🍩 Dosh - пончики, похожие на арт-объекты, а не десерты.



Между кафе - мастерские, студии, уголки с керамикой, тихие творческие пространства. Каждый этаж дышит собой, но вместе они создают цельную атмосферу дома, где хочется задержаться.



3. Атмосфера, которую невозможно скопировать. Коридоры немного покосившиеся. Ты садишься с чашкой кофе и слышишь: смех студентов, шелест страниц, музыку из соседнего кафе…The Café Apartment - это не интерьер. Это настроение. И именно настроение делает его культовым.



4. Место, где контент создаётся сам собой. Каждая стена - как открытка. Сарафанное радио здесь работает быстрее любой рекламы: люди фотографируют, возвращаются  и приводят друзей. Место стало медиа-каналом ещё до того, как это слово вошло в тренды.



👉 Мурлычий совет от кота Баюна: Преобразование жилого пространства в ""вертикальный маркетплейс"" показывает, как аутентичность старого здания генерирует больше трафика, чем современные ТЦ: низкие аренды для малого бизнеса + креативная идентичность = туристический магнит без больших вложений.

**EXCERPT FROM: MY LIFE AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT** by Amina Noor Baloch, Published by Moon River Publisher, Collection: Heroes of Our Times Date: c. 211X

It did not take me three days. Honestly? It barely took five hours. Five hours of this total adrenaline-dump tour where my brain was basically vibrating in my skull. Every single lab I walked into felt like stepping into a dream where the laws of physics were just... suggestions. Everything was filled with this crazy sense of wonder, and the people there were actually super chill. They were doing their absolute best to explain the literal magic they were working with in a way that didn't make me feel like a total idiot.

I think they were used to talking to geniuses, not a girl who still remembers the smell of the goat market. There were these two guys, probably not much older than me, and this one woman with really cool glowing tech-implants who kept hitting on me—gently, you know? Like, testing the waters. I’ve lived enough life to know how to play the 'clueless' card perfectly without making things awkward or insulting anyone. I just kept my eyes on the tech and my heart in my throat. By the time the tour was over, I didn't need any more time. I was already home.

I lay in my bed that night, staring up at the ceiling and pretending to actually weigh the pros and cons, but it was just a performance for an audience of one. The choice had been made in my gut five hours ago, probably the second I saw the holographic schematics for the heavy-lift drives. I was going to the Far Side. I was going to the Shipyard.

People back on the ground—the ones with their grey suits and their endless, soul-crushing spreadsheets—they talk about the Moon like it’s just a rock. They use words like ‘logistics’ and ‘feasibility’ and ‘budgetary constraints.’ To them, it’s all just numbers on a screen, a way to say ‘no’ to anything that doesn't fit in a box. That’s their weapon: incredulity. They can’t imagine a chariot of Ra because they’re too busy calculating the cost of the gold leaf. They think the void is a problem to be solved, not a kingdom to be claimed.

But out there, in the shadow of the craters where the Earth can't see us, we will be building something that’s going to make the sun look like a candle. We will take on Apophis—that great serpent of the old world’s chaos and its boring, stagnant doubt. I want to be the one holding the torch. I want to be the one who turns the 'impossible' into a flight plan. The Far Side isn't just a place; it's the only place where the spreadsheets finally stop making noise and the stars start to talk back.

The following morning, the breakfast was already waiting outside my door—something that smelled like real cinnamon and expensive coffee, way too fancy for a girl who used to be happy with a handful of dates. But I didn't even look at the tray. I walked straight to the wall terminal, my palm itching. The second I put my hand on the sensor plate, it felt warm, like the building itself was checking my pulse to see if I was lying.

“Amina Noor Baloch, did you make your choice?”

The words on the screen were small, but they felt like they were screaming. I didn't whisper. I didn't mumble. I stood up straight and said it like I was already standing on the Lunar regolith: “I choose the shipyard. I'm going to the Moon.”

The screen blinked once, turned a deep, satisfied blue, and then went dark. A second later, my pad on the nightstand started vibrating like it was trying to burrow through the wood. I grabbed it, my fingers shaking just a little.

***Amina Noor Baloch, you have been provisionally assigned to the Moon Project Excalibur.*** I blinked at the word “provisional assignment.”

Then the rest appears:

***Confirmation upon obtaining a Deep Space Working Certificate.***

That one was new.

1. ***Radiation protection treatment—in the medical department of this facility***
2. ***Zero-G movements, work, and sex certification—a two-week course in the orbital training center***
3. ***Initiation to Zero-G craft piloting—same facility as above—objective: discouraging any impulse of manual piloting in space.***

I yelled at the pad, “No way I’m having sex in public in a classroom! Or ever!”

The pad had no mic, but the wall terminal must have picked it up:

***Zero-G sex training consists of watching a mandatory video. Engaging in such activity with a chosen partner is totally optional. Most students find that activity the best part of the certification.***

You bet! So, let’s go to Number One. I’d heard that everybody was given an injection before going up there to protect against the nasty effects of space radiation above the Van Allen belt, which shields Earth from the solar wind. I finished my breakfast as fast as I could, only to find the same LEDs waiting for me, guiding me back to that underground elevator. This time, we didn't just go to the bottom; we went through the bottom. For a split second, I saw what looked like a subterranean harbor—a massive, echoing vault with a submarine so gigantic it looked like a sleeping whale made of steel. Then I landed in a hospital.

The LEDs led me into an examination room that looked more like a VIP lounge than a doctor’s office. It had this super plush armchair, a holographic communicator, and a strange-looking transparent coffin sitting in the corner that gave me the chills.

Suddenly, the communicator flickered to life, and a representation of a Sibil appeared.

“Hi Amina, I’m Esculape Sibil, Chief Doctor of the SLAM Corporation. How are you today? I heard that you are an adult who has made her first real choice in life?”

Even though I knew 'he' was probably talking to hundreds of people at the same time while monitoring thousands of life parameters, I actually liked him. He sounded sympathetic and buoyant, like he was genuinely happy I was there.

“I’m great,” I said, trying to look way more confident than I actually felt. I didn't want him seeing the part of me that was still a terrified kid from the street. “But seriously, why do I need the Chief Doctor for a simple shot? Did I accidentally sign up for a heart transplant or something?”

He gave me this dramatic wink, leaning into the whole 'old-timey movie star' vibe he had going on. “My, my, not inducted into the holiest procedure of the corporation yet, are you?” He chuckled, and it sounded like real, warm human laughter. “Injections are for the workers, Amina. They have to get poked every three months. But you? You’re special. You’re getting the upgrade. A tiny device—consisting of a long-life power cell and a nanoparticle generator. You’ll be shielded for the next century.”

My brain did a literal record-scratch. “Whoa, hold on. No way. I am not having a mini Helios generator shoved inside me. I’m not trying to end up like a piece of fried chicken, cooked from the inside out!”

Esculape let out a light laugh. “Nothing that dramatic, I promise. It’s just a tiny nuclear battery.”

“A WHAT?!)” I practically jumped out of the chair.

He just smirked. “Relax, kid. I’m joking. But the nanoparticle generator? That’s the mandatory part. Reid has one, Clarissa and Brenda have them, so don’t even bother fighting it. It’s just the cost of doing business in the stars.”

He leaned in closer to me, his expression getting a little more serious. “However, there are two optional upgrades I strongly recommend you take. One is an integrated safeguard in case of... well, let’s call it a major biological failure. Say a micro-meteorite decides to turn your heart and lungs into Swiss cheese. This little beauty keeps your brain fed and oxygenated, even after your body has technically checked out, so we have enough time to bring you to a repair shop and fix you properly.”

The air in the room suddenly felt like it was made of lead. My stomach did a slow, nauseating roll. “That... that’s what happened to Reid, isn't it? In the submarine?”

Esculape nodded slowly. “Exactly. We had three months to rebuild his body from the ground up before the final reboot.”

*Reboot.* The word echoed in my head, cold and metallic. My heart was thumping against my ribs. *Reboot.* Like he’s a fucking laptop. Just hit 'Control-Alt-Delete' and hope the OS isn't corrupted. God, these people are absolutely insane. These people? My people.

I could feel my hands starting to shake a little in my lap. I tried to steady my voice. ""And the other one? The second 'upgrade'?""

Esculape waved a hand like he was swatting a fly. ""Oh, that? Barely worth mentioning, really. Just a direct link between your grey matter and the Sibil network. High-speed, brain-to-WiFi interface. Don't worry, it’s got a firewall like a fortress—nothing gets in or out unless you explicitly ask for it. No random thoughts leaking into the cloud. But it’s a total game-changer. You can request calculations, simulations, order equipment… Also, it’ll open doors, call elevators, and let you pilot a ship just by *thinking* about it. Standard stuff, really.""

I gripped the arms of that plush chair so hard my knuckles turned white. *Now* I get why the chair is so soft. It’s to catch you before you hit the floor. One more 'standard' insane detail and I’m going to need that fucking death-safeguard just to survive this conversation.

""Okay, just for kicks,"" I said, trying to make my voice sound steady even though my pulse was doing a drum solo in my neck. ""How many people have actually gone through with this? How many are ‘safeguarded and integrated’?""

Esculape didn't even have to look it up. ""Out of our million-plus employees? Exactly one thousand four hundred and fifty-three. And before you start worrying about your schedule, you won’t spend more than forty-eight hours in this medical bay.""

Fourteen hundred. Out of a freaking million. That’s a tiny-ass number. It’s the kind of statistic that tells you you’re either joining the gods or the most expensive suicide cult in history. It’s the kind of decision that makes your stomach do backflips, the kind you shouldn't think about for more than a second or you'll never do it.

""Fine,"" I said, standing up. ""But if this fails and I wake up as some digital vegetable, I am going to haunt you for all eternity. I'm talking serious poltergeist shit. Where do I sign?""

The transparent coffin—the 'bay'—slid open with a soft, clinical hiss. I looked back at the screen to see if Esculape was impressed by my bravado, but the communicator was dark. He was already gone.

I woke up in my own bed, upstairs. Another breakfast was already waiting, the same as usual. It felt like I’d spent my entire life on this strange island just eating breakfast and talking to ghosts. I looked around for my pad—nothing. I must have left it down in that creepy medical basement. I dragged myself over to the wall terminal, but before I could even touch the sensor, a line of text just... appeared. Not on the wall. Not on a screen. It was just floating there in the air, right in front of my face like a ghost.

***Sub-vocalize: 'get directions'.***

My heart skipped a beat. I didn't even open my mouth; I just thought the words, moving my throat muscles like I was whispering a secret to myself. *Get directions.*

Immediately, a tiny, glowing line of text popped up in the corner of my eye, tracking with my vision: ***Take pod to STO-Slam Training Orbital. Send acknowledgement.***

“ACK,” I whispered, or thought, or whatever the hell I was doing with my brain-wi-fi.

***Use the same procedure for whatever you need.***

My Fiancé of Ten Years
Chapter 1
It took Lorena Johansen a full decade to make her way, step by step, to Raymond Rothman's side.
From an obscure admirer to the woman he finally acknowledged as his fiancée.
Yet, just two weeks before the wedding, she decided to walk away.
""I volunteer to transfer to the Southwest Field Station. Please add my name to the list.""
Lorena placed the signed application on the desk, her voice steady.
The supervisor behind the computer looked up, stunned. ""Lori, aren't you supposed to marry Raymond next month?
""Everyone knows you came to this institute for Raymond. Now, just as you're about to get what you wanted, you're transferring to the Southwest?""
Lorena forced down the sour ache in her throat and interrupted the well-meaning advice. ""Please, just approve it.""
Everyone around her knew how hard she'd worked over the years to get close to Raymond.
She'd given up a promotion to become his assistant. Raymond avoided any close contact, yet she showed a patience that seemed superhuman.
For ten years, she made herself indispensable—handling every detail of his life, sparing him from trivial worries, and turning away all unnecessary social obligations.
To outsiders, it looked like Raymond treated her differently.
The reclusive genius remembered her birthday and even let her stay overnight in the lounge when she wasn't feeling well.
But only Lorena knew—the birthday gift was a hefty bank transfer, because he couldn't be bothered to pick something out.
And the night she stayed over, he worked straight through, leaving her coughing and feverish in the next room, never asking once if she was okay.
No one knew that Raymond's proposal wasn't because she'd finally won his heart, but because of the kidnapping two months earlier.
Raymond was abducted; Lorena went alone to that abandoned factory.
To protect him, she became the new target.
They knocked her to the ground, clubs thudding against her back with a dull, heavy sound.
She never cried out in pain, which only enraged the attackers further. They slammed her head against the cold concrete floor.
She managed to buy enough time for the police to arrive, but her injuries nearly killed her.
When she finally woke up, Raymond—who rarely left his lab unless necessary—was sitting by her hospital bed.
His eyes were bloodshot, his voice hoarse. ""Let's find a time to meet our parents and settle on a wedding date.""
After years together, Lorena could see the guilt in Raymond's eyes.
He was marrying her out of remorse, nothing more.
And yet, she accepted that moral coercion—shamefully—just to earn the right to stay by his side.
If Paulina Massey had never appeared, maybe Lorena could have lied to herself forever.
Lorena left her senior's office. As she stepped out of the administration building, the giant screen outside was broadcasting the international summit live.
A group of people stood clustered beneath it, excitedly pointing and whispering, ""Look! It's Professor Rothman and Paulina!""
""They look great together... I heard Paulina's paper was personally supervised by Professor Rothman.""
""Professor Rothman is famously aloof—he actually agreed to supervise her? Even an iceberg melts when someone like Paulina comes along.""
The chatter made Lorena's head spin. All over the institute, people praised how well Paulina and Raymond matched.
She'd been by Raymond's side for years, yet almost no one knew she was his actual fiancée.
Lorena fought off the dizziness and looked up.
On the close-up screen, Paulina leaned in to whisper to Raymond, and he bent his head to listen.
They were close—so close—but he showed no discomfort.
This was the man who insisted on a three-meter safety buffer whenever Lorena reported to him, now letting someone else's breath brush his ear.
She'd thought his boundaries were impenetrable.
But Paulina's presence showed her a different Raymond.
Lorena remembered the first time she heard Raymond mention Paulina's name.
He was staring at a mess of data, but there was a faint smile on his lips. ""Paulina mixed up the sample order again.""
There was no blame in his tone—just resignation and indulgence.
Paulina, the mentor's daughter, had been foisted onto Raymond's team because of her connections.
She was like the sun in June—radiant, fearless, and free.
She'd snatch the pencil from Raymond's hand to scribble equations, offer him her half-finished milkshake, even slap his shoulder and laugh out loud while he was deep in thought.
At first, Raymond stiffened whenever Paulina got close. But soon, he let her scatter his papers, accepted drinks he'd never touch, and even smiled at her jokes.
If Lorena hadn't seen it herself—Paulina standing on tiptoe to kiss Raymond's cheek in the lab, and Raymond, who always flinched from Lorena's accidental touch, simply freezing, his ears turning red, but didn't pull away.
She would never have known that when Raymond truly liked someone, he became just as clumsy as any other boy—his heartbeat spiraling, his principles crumbling.
Lorena returned to their house—a place Raymond had never set foot in since it was furnished.
Calmly, she opened the closet and began folding her clothes, one by one.
All those carefully chosen household items, the cozy life she'd imagined sharing with him, now felt like a silent mockery.
She found some boxes and packed away every trace of herself, scheduling a courier to pick them up.
When she finished, her phone screen lit up.
Her transfer to the Southwest Field Station had been officially approved.
Almost simultaneously, a message from Raymond appeared. ""Flight arrives in New York at 8 tomorrow night. Pick me up.""
Lorena stared at the message for a long time.
Then she picked up her phone and calmly replied.
""Not available.""
Chapter 2
Lorena moved quickly.
Within a single day, every trace of her presence in the house was wiped clean.
When the realtor brought clients to view the place, it was almost impossible to tell anyone had ever lived there.
Just like her—after all these years, she hadn't managed to leave a mark on Raymond's life.
""Ms. Johansen, are you sure you want to sell so urgently? With this location and these renovations, you're really underpricing it.""
""I'm sure,"" Lorena said, signing the listing agreement, her voice calm. ""The sooner, the better.""
She'd bought this house filled with hope for the future, but now that she was leaving, it no longer mattered.
The research institute required her to finish handing off her duties before she could leave, so she had to stay at headquarters for another two weeks.
The day Raymond and Paulina returned, a steady rain fell over New York.
Lorena was in the lab, organizing data, when her phone lit up with a message from Raymond. ""Landed.""
In the past, no matter how late it was or how bad the weather, those texts would send her rushing out the door. Even with a severe cold and fever, she'd force herself to drive to pick him up—only to faint while waiting, and Raymond would end up taking a cab back to the lab himself.
When he found out later, he simply said, ""Next time, if you're not feeling well, don't come.""
No concern, just a statement.
She'd been upset by that ""don't come"" for a long time, convinced she'd messed up.
Lorena turned off her screen and kept checking the data.
The institute hosted a small welcome dinner for Raymond and Paulina after their celebrated return.
Lorena hadn't wanted to go, but the deputy director personally invited her, and she couldn't find a reason to refuse.
She arrived late and chose a seat in the corner.
By then, the dinner was well underway. The guests of honor—Raymond and Paulina—sat at the head of the table.
Paulina animatedly recounted stories from the summit, keeping everyone laughing.
Even Raymond, usually so withdrawn, sat quietly, showing no sign of impatience.
Whenever Paulina, swept up in excitement, grabbed his arm and shook it, he only frowned slightly—never pulling away.
""Oh, yesterday was such a mess,"" Paulina said, suddenly glancing at Lorena in the corner.
""Our flight was delayed, and then it was pouring when we got out. Ray and I waited forever and couldn't get a cab. Our suitcases got soaked.
""Lori, I remember you always handled airport pickups. Why didn't you come this time?""
Instantly, every eye at the table turned toward Lorena, curiosity in their gaze.
Lorena set down her fork, dabbed her mouth with a napkin, and met Paulina's seemingly innocent look. ""Arranging transportation from the airport isn't part of my job description.""
Paulina's smile faltered.
Raymond, seated at the head, finally looked her way.
His face was unreadable, but Lorena caught a brief flicker of surprise in his eyes.
Of course—he was used to it.
Used to her handling every little detail, used to her always being there when needed.
Like air—unnoticed until it's gone, when its absence leaves a faint discomfort.
The dinner ended under a subtle, uneasy cloud.
As the crowd dispersed, Raymond stopped Lorena at the end of the hallway.
""What's going on with you?""
His voice was as calm as ever.
Lorena paused, looking at him.
The hallway light cast soft shadows across his sharply defined features. She'd once thought that just being able to look at him like this for a lifetime would be a blessing.
""What do you mean?""
""Paulina was just asking, nothing more.""
Raymond hesitated, searching for words to explain.
""At this summit, her expertise was a real asset. You're my personal assistant, so these kinds of details should—""
Lorena knew he thought she was acting out, making a scene because of Paulina.
""Raymond Rothman.""
It was the first time she'd ever called him by his full name. Her voice was quiet, but it cut him off mid-sentence.
He stared at her, clearly not expecting the interruption.
""I'm not throwing a tantrum.
""And it's not because of who you went to the summit with.""
Lorena met his gaze, her heart aching dully.
She took a deep breath and finally spoke the words she'd rehearsed countless times in her mind. ""Let's call off the engagement.""
Chapter 3
Raymond's brow furrowed slightly. ""What did you just say?""
He was still stunned when Paulina came running down the hall. ""Ray! There's a problem with sample three!""
Raymond immediately turned to her. ""What's wrong?""
""The threshold's off the charts—you need to come see!"" Paulina tugged at his sleeve.
He glanced back at Lorena, his tone even. ""The data's urgent. We'll talk after I handle this.""
With that, he didn't give Lorena a chance to respond and hurried off with Paulina, leaving her standing in the hallway.
Lorena watched them disappear, her face expressionless.
She wasn't surprised. To him, everything else always took precedence over her.
And his ""we'll talk later"" almost certainly meant there'd be no follow-up.
He never bothered with the details of the wedding anyway—just paid the bills.
Now that he'd been notified, her obligations were done.
She'd listed the house for sale with a realtor, but she'd already given up her old apartment. Only now did Lorena realize she didn't have anywhere to go.
Half an hour later, Lorena stood outside the door of a modest apartment.
Her mother, Sharon Holcomb, answered, her face lighting up with a welcoming smile. ""Lori? What brings you home all of a sudden? Where's Ray? Didn't he come up with you?""
Lorena squeezed past her into the entryway, her voice flat. ""He's not here.""
In the living room, her father, Martin Johansen, and her younger brother, Nathan Johansen, were sprawled on the couch watching TV, feet propped on the coffee table.
Hearing the commotion, Martin twisted around, peering past Lorena as if expecting someone else. ""Where's Professor Rothman? Is he parking downstairs?""
""We broke up.""
The air froze for a moment.
""What did you say?"" Martin's smile vanished. He shot to his feet, voice rising.
""Broke up? What do you mean, broke up!""
""I've called off the engagement. We're done.""
Lorena repeated herself, her tone steady.
Bang!
Martin kicked the glass coffee table, sending the fruit plate and teacups crashing to the floor.
Scalding tea splashed onto Lorena's shin, stinging sharply.
""You useless girl!"" Martin's veins bulged at his temples as he jabbed a finger at her face and started shouting.
""I raised you for nothing! Do you know what kind of man Raymond is? People would kill for a chance with him! And you—you just throw it away?""
Nathan, legs crossed, chimed in with a sneer.
""Lori, let's be real. Who is Professor Rothman? Look at the people around him—every one of them is top-tier talent.
""I heard about Paulina, at his lab—his mentor's daughter. Now that's a good match.""
He snorted, giving Lorena a once-over. ""What do you have besides a pretty face? Landing Professor Rothman was pure luck. If you had any sense, you'd just suck it up and let it pass.
""Men fool around, it's normal. Now you're breaking up, where am I supposed to get the money to get married? You're ruining things for your own brother.""
Lorena stared at the three faces twisted by disappointment and greed, listening to words that cut deeper than any wound. The burn on her leg throbbed, but it couldn't compare to the chill in her chest.
This was her family.
She'd once longed for a little warmth from them, even if it was fake.
Most of every dollar she earned went into this bottomless pit.
Nathan's tuition for a second-rate college, her parents' endless demands for ""retirement money,"" the down payment on a new house...
She'd given until she was numb, still holding onto a fragile hope.
When Raymond proposed, everything changed—more phone calls, friendlier voices.
They even asked if she was tired sometimes.
She'd naively thought it was belated affection, that her parents had finally seen her worth.
Now, the illusion was shattered, the truth laid bare.
They'd only ever cared about what Lorena could wring out of Raymond—not about her.
Lorena didn't say another word, didn't even bother with the burn on her leg.
She dragged her suitcase from against the wall and headed straight for the door.
""Where do you think you're going? Just a few words and you storm out?
""If you're so tough, don't come back! See if anyone cares about you then!""
Lorena slammed the door behind her, shutting out the noise.
In the dim, flickering hallway, she leaned against the wall and took a deep breath.
The world was vast, but she had nowhere to go.
Chapter 4
Dragging her suitcase behind her, Lorena picked up the key to a temporary dorm room from the institute's administration office.
The room was tucked into a corner on the top floor, just big enough for her to make do for the next two weeks.
She cradled a heavy cardboard box filled with odds and ends, mostly books.
As she started up the stairs, she nearly collided with Raymond and Paulina coming down.
Paulina held a folder, her head turned toward Raymond, laughing at something he'd said. She almost bumped into Lorena.
""Oh! Sorry!"" Paulina steadied the box that was slipping from Lorena's arms.
""Lori, what are you moving? It looks heavy—let me help you carry it upstairs!""
Her smile was bright, her voice cheerfully insistent.
Lorena instinctively tightened her grip, sidestepping Paulina's touch. ""No, thank you.""
""It's fine, really! I'm stronger than I look!"" Paulina reached out again.
But this time, Raymond, who'd been silent, stepped forward and took the box from Lorena himself.
Paulina laughed. ""Ray! Those hands are supposed to be doing precision work—they're national treasures! You shouldn't be lugging boxes.""
Raymond glanced at Paulina, and for a moment, the usual chill in his eyes softened into a faint, teasing smile—a tone Lorena had never heard from him, indulgent and playful. ""You're the precious one here.""
The words were light, but they pierced Lorena's heart like a needle.
She remembered when she'd first become his assistant, struggling to carry a pile of heavy research papers. They'd slipped from her arms and scattered across the floor.
Flustered and embarrassed, she'd scrambled to pick them up, afraid he'd think she was clumsy.
He'd only paused, glanced at her, and walked on—never stooping to help, never offering a word. Later, he'd simply had the admin assign her a wheeled cart.
He'd never said, ""I'll do it."" Never joked with her, never called her precious.
Paulina blushed at his words, laughing. ""Ray, you're teasing me again!""
Raymond didn't reply, just asked, ""Which floor?""
""Fourth,"" Lorena heard herself answer, her voice dry.
They carried the box upstairs, chatting easily as they went.
Paulina rambled about some amusing lab data from earlier, Raymond responding now and then, the atmosphere light and natural.
Lorena trailed behind, keeping a few steps' distance.
This scene was familiar.
For most of the past ten years, she'd followed behind him just like this.
Watching his solitary figure drift further away, and then, eventually, watching Paulina join him.
She was always the extra shadow, struggling to keep up, never really part of his world.
At the door to Unit 402, Lorena fished out her key.
The dorm was simple—a bed, a desk, a closet, and a private bathroom, but it was clean.
Raymond set the box down just inside the door, his movements casual.
Only then did he seem to remember something, glancing around the cramped room before his gaze landed back on Lorena.
""What made you decide to stay in the dorm?""
Lorena dragged her suitcase inside, her voice steady. ""I sold the house.""
She paused, waiting—maybe for a question, maybe for a hint of surprise—but all she got was a brief silence.
Then Raymond spoke, his tone unchanged. ""If you don't like it, get another place. No need to make yourself uncomfortable.""
Lorena slowly straightened and looked at him.
He didn't care. Not about the house, not about why she'd moved out.
He probably hadn't even taken her words about calling off the engagement seriously.
Paulina stood behind Raymond, watching, a faint smile on her lips. ""Lori, go ahead and get settled in. Ray and I need to stop by the data center.""
Raymond nodded at Lorena in farewell, then turned and left with Paulina.
Lorena stood in the doorway, staring at the empty hall. She looked down at her hand, red and sore from gripping the box.
Make herself uncomfortable?
The real issue was that her years of effort had been ignored.
Was passion reduced to a wire transfer, risking her life, rewarded only with a guilty engagement, and never being enough for the one person who could smile, who could call someone precious?
The bitterness hit her all at once, flooding her heart and choking her throat.
Chapter 5
The next few days passed quietly. Lorena had just finished a round of data simulations and was packing up her things.
Suddenly, the lab door slammed open. Renee Danforth burst in, pale-faced. ""Lori! Hurry! Your mom and brother are causing a huge scene at the entrance—the security guards can't hold them back!""
Lorena's heart sank. Ever since she'd stopped sending money home after leaving that day, she'd expected trouble—but not this soon.
Even from a distance, she could hear Nathan's arrogant yelling mixed with Sharon's wails.
The entrance was packed with onlookers. Sharon sat on the ground, slapping her thighs and crying, ""How is this fair? My daughter makes it big and then abandons her own parents!""
Nathan was shouting at a security guard, finger in his face. ""Get out of my way! I have every right to ask my sister for money!""
Lorena pushed through the crowd. ""Mom, Nathan, what are you doing?""
""What are we doing?"" Nathan shoved past the guard and got right in her face.
""Lorena, you think you're something now? I still need 35,000 dollars for my wedding—you're giving it to me today!""
""I already send enough every month to cover the family's expenses. Your wedding? I won't give you a cent!"" Lorena's voice was icy.
""Bullshit! You were throwing money around when you were with Raymond! Now he dumped you, and you can't play big shot anymore, huh?"" Nathan suddenly shoved her hard.
""You're just asking for it!""
Lorena, caught off guard, crashed to the floor.
Her elbow and knee slammed into the cold marble, blood oozing from the scrapes.
The crowd went dead silent, everyone stunned.
Lorena tried to push herself up, but pain shot through her knee, keeping her down.
The sting of the wounds was sharp, but nothing compared to the humiliation of being shoved to the ground by her own brother in front of everyone.
She looked up at the family she'd supported for over a decade, her voice cold and hard. ""I said I don't have the money.""
""Bitch! I'll shut you up!"" Nathan snapped, grabbing a metal sculpture from a nearby planter and swinging it at Lorena.
People screamed. In that split second, a figure darted in front of Lorena.
Bang!
The sculpture struck the newcomer's back with a heavy thud.
It was Raymond.
No one saw him arrive, but he shielded Lorena completely, taking the blow square on his back.
He grunted, brow furrowed in pain, but didn't move from his protective stance.
Lorena stared, stunned. Nathan's legs buckled, and he nearly collapsed.
Sharon's face went ghostly pale, her whole body shaking.
Nathan had actually struck Raymond. Forget asking for money—now the whole family was finished.
""Call the police,"" Raymond's voice rang out, clear and commanding.
""Someone assaulted a research scientist, endangering public safety. Pull the security footage and preserve the evidence.""
Police sirens wailed, growing louder. Nathan and Sharon looked ashen.
As they were led away, Sharon kept sobbing, ""Lori! I'm your mother! You can't do this to us!""
Lorena watched as Sharon and Nathan were loaded into the squad car.
The crowd dispersed, but the sting of their stares lingered.
She struggled to her feet, stumbling.
Raymond reached out to steady her, noticing her injuries.
""Let's get you to the infirmary.""
Lorena looked up at him, catching the lowered angle of his eyes.
That expression suddenly took her back to their high school days.
Raymond had always been the genius—winning every competition, his name always at the top of the honor roll.
Even with his distant nature, he had been the crush of half the school.
Lorena's grades were average, her parents indifferent—she was invisible.
Their lives should never have crossed.
Until one day, her period caught her off guard, leaving her stuck to her chair in shame, unable to move until everyone else had left. Just as she was about to give up hope, she heard footsteps returning.
It was Raymond. He quietly placed a pack of pads and a school jacket on her desk.
""They're all gone,"" he said, voice calm, eyes politely averted from the mess. ""It's pouring outside; no one will see you.""
Outside, rain hammered the windows. She saw his hair and shoulders drenched.
In that moment, her heart thundered louder than the storm.
Chapter 6
At home, she was an afterthought; at school, she was invisible.
And yet it was this boy she barely dared to admire who, in her most humiliating moment, salvaged the last shred of her dignity.
Raymond had given her a glimmer of light, and she'd flown toward it like a moth to a flame.
After that, she studied desperately, just barely managing to get into the same college as him.
He remained the golden boy and, after graduation, became the youngest lead researcher at the institute.
She sent in her application, turning down every chance for advancement, just to stand by Raymond's side.

* How much longer does it actually take to make a cup of coffee with a semi‑automatic in daily use? I know it’s “more work,” but is it a lot more when you just want a quick morning espresso or cappuccino?
* •And on the other side: is cleaning a fully automatic machine (like the DeLonghi) really as much of a hassle as some reviews say? Things like cleaning the brew group, milk system, descaling, etc.

You know that feeling when you're deep in a codebase, jumping between 15 different files, and you lose track of where that one critical function lives? I've been there too many times. That's why I built Group Code in the first place.

But here's what I learned after talking to developers actually using it: organization isn't just about grouping code. It's about remembering what matters to YOU, right now, in this moment of your project.

So v1.5.0 brings something I should have built from day one: a Favorites System.

Star the code groups you're actively working on. They float to the top. When you favorite a parent group, all the children come along. And when you close VS Code and come back tomorrow morning with your coffee, everything's exactly where you left it.

The other thing that kept bugging me was Git conflicts. You'd organize your workspace, commit, and then boom, your teammate's preferences would clash with yours. It felt wrong. Your personal workflow shouldn't mess with version control.

Now all your preferences live in your OS user profile. My favorites stay mine. Your favorites stay yours. The code groups we share stay in the repo where they belong. Clean separation.

I also added tree view state persistence because I got tired of re-expanding the same nodes every single time. Small thing, but it adds up when you're doing it 50 times a day.

For me, this update represents something bigger than features. It's about respecting how developers actually work. We don't all navigate code the same way. We don't all focus on the same things at the same time. And our tools should honor that instead of fighting it.

Group Code helps you organize code by what it does, not just where it lives in folders. It works with GitHub Copilot for AI-powered organization, supports 40+ languages, and now, it remembers what matters to you.

Available on VS Code Marketplace and Open VSX Registry (for the VSCodium users out there, I see you).

If you've been using Group Code, I'd genuinely love to hear what's working and what's not. This tool exists because of real frustrations from real developers, including me.",1,1767941848.0,u_Logical_Employ_2950,0,1.0,False
1q81eyf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Letters_Unsent/comments/1q81eyf/i_never_should_have_let_you_in/,I never should have let you in.,"I never should have let you into my world. I never should have believed you would love me as unconditionally as i loved you. I never should have let you convince me to let you provide for me because now you twisted it into ""i funded YOUR dream"". It was OUR dream. We worked on it together every single day. You said you LOVED it. You said you were happy. And now, i caught you cheating and everything is MY FAULT. I had a few bad moments when i was younger because of my neurodivergence. You pointed it out and said that was cause. And it was. But i wanted to get my behavior in check. I NEVER EVER insulted you or talked down to you. I NEVER EVER physically harmed you or any of your possessions or our shared living area. I made it a point not to cross those lines. I had a handful of those moments that gradually phased out with age. The moments were ALL caused by the same thing; your families relentless bullying of me, talking down on my family (so you told me), and butting into our relationship CONSTANTLY. YOU never stood up for me. I FOUGHT for the relationship all the time. I was constantly put into a situation where i had to fight and i had to do it so often i developed severe separation anxiety from you. And again that phased with age. You HAVE physically abused me. You HAVE talked down to me and gaslit me, minimized my feelings, my traumas, and my sense of self worth. 

You CHEATED ON ME when i set forth the path for us to be with him (with boundaries) because he liked you and you liked him. He was my friend and you liked him. I wanted to be open minded and allow you both to have freedom to persue each other. I liked him too. BUT i set boundaries (our old poly boundaries) and you BROKE THEM. You went behind my back, stopped spending time with me, revoked sexual privileges and talked to me about giving them to HIM.  And why did you do this? Because i stopped paying attention to you because of what was going on in the country because i was scared our family was going to be devastated by wartime and depression. You called me crazy in so many words. You said ""that cant happen"". It is happening now. I live at the bottom now and i SEE the damage first hand now. You talk about your social justice points but you NEVER have EVER offered to help someone in need. In fact you always kept me from helping others. You treated me weird for wanting to homestead. I think you thought it was a phase that would pass. I wanted it because i wanted to keep you safe. I was your partner and you were my love. It was my only obligation. I TRUELY cared about you. I was ready to die for you. I would've taken care of you if you had cancer. I wouldve given you my organs. You couldnt stay by side after recovering from grief and our first major hardship. You are a coward and liar because now you tell everyone i am the liar and you try to shut me up every time i talk about things. 

And the worst part. I STILL LOVE YOU. Stupid me. You literally betrayed 11 years of trust and i still love you. And im fucking stupid for it and i know i am because you either have no remorse or you are so ashamed you cant admit guilt. I never abused you. And most days of ours were mundane. We watched tv together and laughed together. We created amazing things together. And thats another thing im pissed about. You tried to take full credit for MY WORKS. Works ive been planning since long before i met you. Characters that i created to survive loneliness in a turbulent alcoholic home. Yes you created PARTS in the premise over time. We were writing PARTNERS. And you created a couple main premises i haven't touched since the split and don't plan to. I brought those to life FOR YOU. I edited things because YOU SAID YOU LOVED what i made for you. and now youre saying i edited it out of malice. I wish i NEVER would have taken interest to help you because now you turned that memory of love into fucking poison. All the art i made of your characters. Time i SPENT bringing your creations, turned OUR creations because you said you wanted it to life. And now it's worthless garbage. I asked you when i was done ""What do you think? Do you like it?"" and you acted like you loved it. So i made more for you. Im sorry for ever believing you. Im sorry for ever trusting you with the most amazing and beautiful part of myself. Im sorry for showing you my tears that you WATCHED my parents demonize me for showing. 

You weaponized every bad thing you witnessed against me, including my sexual assaults as a kid. Trying to paint me as predatory towards young adults. FUCK YOU. I would NEVER harm anyone and to even SAY that is fucking abysmal. And i know who you were talking about and they were 19-20 and became a good friend of ours. My neurodivergence makes love and attachment fucking weird for me and it makes societal norms blurry. But when concise boundaries are laid i understand. Sorry im stupid like that. Im sorry im such a slow dumbass. Genuinely i hate that about myself. And now because of all of this i cant even open up affectionately AT ALL. Thank you for that. You know how affectionate i was. I would wrestle and play and sometimes nibble (neurodivergence). Now im scared to even reach out a hand to people. You have destroyed the way i connect with people. But that what you wanted right? You couldn't fucking stand me because you were so fucking jealous. And now i see what you were doing. You provided for ""my dream"" because you were living vicariously THROUGH me. You told me TO MY FACE. ""im jealous of your art"" ""im jealous of how you werent raised with technology because i feel different in how i react to things"" ""im jealous of how you handle people"" and theres more. I never cared about what people thought of me until YOUUUUU. Until your family broke my confidence for YEARS and you never stood up for me. Not once until i finally had to set my boundary of i will not stay with you unless you re-enforce boundaries with your parents and stand up for me. And yes because of all the times of; bullying, not respecting our space as an ADULT couple, not respecting our time and PROVOKING ME TO GET A RISE OUT OF ME then going ""oh shes mentally unstable"" (reactive abuse by the way). You caused over 50%. of every. fucking. issue. i have with my mental health. You even told me to my face you did. You always said ""why do you love me?"" and made me explain why i loved you. and what did i tell you? "" i love you because i love you. I just love you. All of you. Even if im upset it doesnt go away. You are smart, creative, fun, funny, loyal, and comforting."" all things i value personally in my relationship. You accused me of stalking you in highschool when you ""tried to get away the first time"". I didnt stalk you. I was in your class as an aid and yes i did ask to be there to talk to you because we got into a friendship fight and i kept trying to resolve it and your INSANE ASS mother cornered me (a minor) with YOUR FATHER AT. MY. HOUSE! and you mattered so much to me i STILL tried to fix our friendship. I cried over you every day when that happened. And what eventually happened? YOU. APPROACHED. ME. you little liar. we became friends again. then what happened next? months later you came to me when i had a BOYFRIEND and in sobbing tears fucking told me you had a crush on me. And what did i do? You said you were scared that i was gonna be mad. I told you it was ok but i wasn't sure what i could do because of my relationship.  And i talked to my boyfriend to tell him the truth and ask if we could date 3 ways. I ASKED PERMISSION. he said yes and we started dating. 

How did you repay me? BY PLUNGING ME into a 3 year lie that would go on to destroy my life and the lives of others involved because you were a coward and wouldn't tell the truth. I wanted to tell the truth but you wouldn't let me then let your family vilify me for nearly 4 years afterwards. When you knew a dream of mine was to have a loving in law family because of how screwed up my own family was. You ruined that for me. As i started to deteriorate from the feud, you convinced me i was mentally disabled and i had autism (i do.) But you started to convince me i was incompetent in certain things. And i know you'll try to say i did that same thing when the truth was i caught you doing several things that kept plunging us into financial debt. You kept insisting to be the bread winner and said it made you happy so i backed off. Same with driving. You didn't want to drive because you said you were scared. (You froze up in the middle of the road and i got upset because our financial situation. i didn't want us to get hurt, land in the hospital, or our only free car to get totaled. After that you just stopped and when i encouraged you to try you got upset and didnt want to. So eventually i stopped because i dodnt want to make you upset) I developed bad habbits because i was stressed mostly in the form of mild animal hoarding. I stopped after some stressors disappeared. But when my dad died i started getting bad again. I didnt realize it. For that i am sorry. My meltdowns got bad again and my depression spiraled too as a result of the ADHD part of my AuDHD due to having to quit caffeine intake suddenly due to a violent panic attack and tachycardia that nearly hospitalized me. This happened before that last time i stopped eating chocolate and drinking coffee and we made a note of it. Anyway. I am sorry for the regression on that front. But your actions to treat me the way you did during a time of insane vulnerability was unacceptable. You left me abruptly after saying a month before ""lets finally get married. i want to get married this year."" addressing the fact that i proposed to you 2 years after we were moved out and you said you weren't ready so i backed off. You said it. Not me. then what happened? 

You left me on my birthday over a mistake YOU MADE. The mistake? Because you were providing for me i was nervous about the financials. I asked you and our friend to write me up a budget detailing the bills and debts SO I COULD HELP YOU BOTH 2 months prior. Yall never did it and when the money that was supposed to be used on my birthday was them allocated to taking care of a fuck up i got angry. I didn't even yell but i did get stern. Then you guys tried to weaponize our other friends reactions of being sad that i got upset about OUR financial situation, when it was not about her at all. You used her to guilt trip me. Then when i confronted you about everything like the cheating (happened a month prior. i told you that we had to break it off with him. I never said we couldnt still be friends. He chose to do that. So you told me. But i think youre still cheating on me with him.) you just said you were done. Then you packed your shit. Destroyed our lives. Killed our pet indirectly through the stress of the move. You caused me to lose my dead father's belongings. You left me to clean the ENTIRE HOUSE. And when i couldnt and i asked you you said ""youre not on the lease. itll be fine."" when i told you the landlord was gonna be pissed and would come after us. You lied and he came after me for a third of the money. You took a car that i trusted to put in your name that you said ""Do you like your new car?"" and i said yes. It was OUR car. The 3 of us. Thats what i intended. For us to have a reliable multi-usr vehicle for snow travel, another income source for labor, and a way for me to provide for you both. Lost my only vehicle when you both ran away back to your parents houses. And you both didnt even need a car. Both of you had your parents cars. You didnt even include me in the discussion. Whats next? Oh yeah you TEAMED UP with our past enemies, turned me into the scape goat, and FUCKED with me online. Accused me of stalking you and YOU are the one looking for my posts or following me on social media cause its pretty fucking easy NOT to see it if you dont care. 

To address the couple incidents i am not proud of during my meltdown moments. 1. The time i threw the shell at the ground expecting it to shatter and it bounced up instead. That was the day your mother said in OUR HOME; ""you know what, i dont think you know how to love properly"" I lost it. That was the peak of the bullying. You didnt stand up for me in that moment. I gave you ultimatum.   2. the time i got upset at you for smoking out our apartment. You were trying to do me a kindness and make eggs. But you burned them and smoked out our apartment. We had pet birds and the smoke could kill them. I got upset. I feel bad about this still and i apologized afterward and a couple times after that acknowledging i overlooked your kindness in the moment. And im doing it again now. 3. the time i freaked our on your birthday and threw a small pepsi at the wall. i had plans with you that were important to me and your dad brought you home late again. While i did meltdown and overreact, the repeated ignoring of boundaries is what prompted it. that was when i was 24. i never ddi anything like that again and tried to start controlling my temper. That was also when we were living at the shop and those fights kept happening so i stayed awake until 8 am to make sure there was no break in when we were asleep. I have a small temper because of my autism there is no denying that. It is part of what makes me myself. But i try to improve it and grow wiser. I always have. Its hard sometimes because i get easily overwhelmed. It did get worse after my dad died. 

Addressing our friends and me not being a good friend. I bend over backwards for people. I did it for C. I acted as a meat shield for all of her bfs. I was there for her during her cats death and even handled the body and packaged the cat. The one her ex bf drowned. I called the police when her other ex bf broke into our condo. I did it for Y/B. When he was gonna walk to a dangerous city shelter i offered him protection and was honest about our situation. His mom came and disrupted my moms life and i GOT yelled at for it. I let M being her rabbits in because they mattered to her and i she didnt take care of them. I got yelled at for that too. Ns family threatened me for helping him move out. I spent money on my credit card for him to get clothes because he said his family neglected him. C OFFERED to buy me a car for the ""trouble she put me through"". I was stupid and accepted. I will never be so naive again. I said id return the favor and sign on for a car for her. I didnt eventually because she kept telling me she was falling asleep at the wheel and was seeming like an irresponsible driver. I didn't want to risk it after hearing that information. BUT i kept trying to find other avenues. I was also Cs personal therapist and YOU pointed that out. I supported all of you in whatever it was you wanted to do all the time. The only thing i was nervous about was Y/B doing the motorcycle thing because my step dads son had just died in a gorey motorcylce accident and i didn't want him to be disabled for life. I also did aknowledge that we all relied on each other and whatever someone did affected everyone. And we were living in order to minimize expenses for everyone and mitigate risk. (we struggled as inflation got very bad, very suddenly hence why i was trying to go back to work)I also told him if it was a dream he truly wanted to persue he was free to leave and persue it and we could still be friends. In hindsight i can see how it can come off as bad, but logic dictated that decision process in the moment. I supported when he wanted to do tattooing. I supported the warrior cat's thing with you. I bought you books when i saw them and when i had my own money. Or other trinkets of your interest like cows or dinosaurs. You loved both. I try to look out and support my friends. And usually when they leave is when i point out something stupid. With C it was the facebook bf she wouldnt stop talking about when my dad was dying. With N it was when i pointed out his video-game addiction. With you it was when i pointed out you cheated on me and was about to find out we were 10 grand in the hole. Y/B just left cause i think they were just overloaded with all the bull. I feel bad because S helped us but didnt disclose how much she was spending and how she was spending it (on her parents cards and had accumulated 7 grand without disclosure of any kind until it got to 7 grand). I feel terrible i cant pat it back because i am now teetering on financial ruin. I also WAS NOT employed and the pay back was supposed to be from you not me because you were providing and she was helping with our shared pets that 5 of us signed up for and i got stuck with %100 grief, cost, care and all. Two of you also got annoyed with me when i tried to tell you NOT to max out our cards and when i tried to instill good financial habits. And you both gaslit me and got anoyed with me so bad i questioned me own judgement. I racked up debt on my cards as a result. A stupid judgement on my part. You guys all did the same thing with the tornado. When it came in you all got mad at me for making you go to basement, for protecting you all. You guys tried to convince me a tornado warning didnt mean a tornado was on the ground when i knew otherwise. So im not a bad friend. Im a bad yes man. Because all goes well UNTIL i try to HELP. And i wont ever try to help again. Ill just nod and smile this time. I dont care anymore. Maybe that callous but what do i care? When i try to be good everyone calls me bad. When i tell the truth everyone calls me a liar. So i give up. Congratulations you managed to turn a genuinely good person into an apathetic husk and call them the bad friend. The only one who isnt at fault is S. She just got caught up. 


And i still care about you. I care about all of you still. You were my family. I still think about if shit hits the fan, will i come help you? You said you dont want me so probably not. Funny aint it? You used to tell me all the time when we were in the shower ""i wanna eat a piece of you when you die."" ""i wanna make bracelet out of your hair."" ""Im obsessed with you. (micky mouse voice)"" ""If you left me i would find you."" ""If we ever broke up would you boombox careless whisper outside my window?"" And the truth was, yeah i would until you said you hated me. You hate me? For what? For making mistakes in my teens and very early twenties? The same mistakes you made and NEVER took accountability for. I grew and though i was never perfect i still tried every day. I felt wrong for even being alive. I felt like a mistake every day. I felt like i had no purpose. You changed that because i thought i finally mattered to someone who saw me. And i thought i had someone i could see. Now its nothing. My deepest wish is maybe it will change but given the damage i doubt it. I forgive easily because i try to see the nuance in people. You don't forgive at all because you're either too scared or just dont care. I want to talk and resolve this like adults one day. But you always run back to the past. All of you do it. You yourself has done it twice already and i dont trust you anymore after all the lying and the secrets. I never had secrets. I never lied to you. I never acted in a way that wasn't coming from deep love and caring. When i tried to point out you could have BPD it was from reflection on years of your behavior and the current situation. It wasnt a jab or an insult. And i said it because you said point blank ""There is something wrong with me. I do X Y and Z"" You talked about banging you head against walls and about your eating disorder. I dont care if you dont believe me. I believe me and i will never doubt me again. I cared about all of you deeply but i will never care about anyone else or trust that deep again. 

And the craziest thing. If you just apologized. Any of you. I would try to mend things. I would apologize for any wrong doings and now that i know of things that bothered i wouldn't repeat it thats for sure. Already wont repeat it. I have already clammed back up and am having a hard time voicing needs again for fear of abandonment or punishment.

PS. i still have your crystals. I found them. i had packed them away in our moving boxes in bubble wrap so they didn't get damaged cause i knew they were important to you.

You're at a party, networking event, or just grabbing coffee with someone new. The conversation starts fine, but then... nothing. Dead air. Awkward silences. You can see their eyes glazing over like they're mentally planning their grocery list. Sound familiar?

I dove deep into this because honestly, I used to be that person who killed conversations without even knowing it. Studied communication research, binged psychology podcasts, read books by actual conversation experts, and here's what I found: Being boring isn't about lacking interesting stories. It's about missing the invisible rules of human connection that no one teaches you.

The wild part? Most of us are accidentally programmed to be boring. Social media trained us to broadcast instead of connect. School taught us to recite facts instead of spark curiosity. And our brains are literally wired to play it safe in social situations. But once you understand the game, you can flip the script.

## Step 1: Stop Being a Conversation Vampire

Here's the uncomfortable truth. Most ""boring"" people aren't boring because they're dull. They're boring because they suck the energy out of conversations. They either talk endlessly about themselves or turn every topic back to their own experiences.

You know the type. Someone mentions they went hiking, and this person immediately jumps in with ""Oh I went hiking too, let me tell you about MY hike for the next 10 minutes."" That's conversation vampirism, and it's killing your interactions.

**The fix**: Use the spotlight technique. When someone shares something, shine the spotlight on THEM, not yourself. Ask follow up questions that go deeper. They mention hiking? Don't share your hiking story. Instead: ""What made you pick that trail?"" or ""Did anything unexpected happen?""

Dr. Charles Duhigg covers this brilliantly in his book **Supercommunicators**. He's a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist who spent years researching what separates magnetic communicators from boring ones. The book breaks down actual conversations and shows you exactly where people go wrong. One insight that blew my mind: great conversationalists match the type of conversation the other person wants. Sometimes people want practical advice, sometimes emotional connection, sometimes just to vent. Reading the room is everything.

## Step 2: Develop Conversational Range (Get Weird With It)

Boring people have one mode. They talk about work, weather, traffic, Netflix shows everyone's seen. Safe topics, zero depth. You need range.

Build a mental library of conversation seeds across different territories. Read weird articles. Listen to podcasts outside your bubble. Learn random facts that make people go ""wait, what?""

But here's the key: **it's not about showing off knowledge**. It's about having ammunition to take conversations somewhere unexpected. Someone mentions they're tired? Instead of ""yeah me too,"" you could say ""I read this thing about how some cultures have different relationships with sleep, like in Spain they still do siestas but it's dying out because of corporate culture.""

Boom. Now you've opened three potential conversation doors: sleep science, cultural differences, or how modern work is changing traditions. Let THEM pick which door to walk through.

**The Hidden Brain podcast** is insane for this. Hosted by Shankar Vedantam, it explores the unconscious patterns that drive human behavior. Each episode gives you fresh perspectives on everyday stuff, psychology, decision making, social dynamics. It's basically cheat codes for understanding people better. The episode on ""Why Conversations Go Wrong"" should be required listening.

BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app that pulls from books, research papers, expert interviews, and real-world case studies to create personalized audio content based on whatever skill you're trying to build. 

Want to get better at reading social cues or understanding communication patterns? Just tell it your goal, and it generates a custom podcast and adaptive learning plan tailored specifically to you. You control the depth too, quick 10-minute summaries when you're busy or 40-minute deep dives with concrete examples when you want to go all in. 

The app has this virtual coach called Freedia that you can chat with anytime, pause mid-episode to ask questions, or get book recommendations based on your struggles. Since it's built by AI experts from Google, the content quality is solid and fact-checked. Plus you can pick different voice styles, from sarcastic to that smooth, sexy Samantha-from-Her vibe, whatever keeps you engaged during your commute or gym session.

## Step 3: Master the Art of Generous Listening

This sounds soft but it's actually hardcore. Most people don't listen, they just wait for their turn to talk. Their brain is busy preparing their next comment instead of actually absorbing what the other person said.

Generous listening means you're genuinely curious. You're trying to understand their world, not just extract information. You notice the emotion behind their words. You pick up on what they're NOT saying.

**Try this**: When someone's talking, resist the urge to formulate your response. Just... listen. Then wait two full seconds after they finish before you speak. This does two things: you actually process what they said, and that pause makes them feel heard. People rarely feel truly heard in conversations.

**The app Ash** is weirdly good for practicing this. It's an AI relationship and communication coach that helps you work through real conversations you're having. You can practice responses, get feedback on your communication style, and learn to catch yourself when you're slipping into bad habits. Sounds gimmicky but it's like having a conversation sensei in your pocket.

## Step 4: Embrace Strategic Vulnerability

Here's where it gets spicy. Safe conversations are boring because nobody's really showing up. Everyone's wearing a mask, playing it cool, keeping it surface level.

Strategic vulnerability means sharing something real, but not trauma dumping. It's the difference between ""Yeah work's fine"" and ""Honestly, I've been feeling stuck lately, trying to figure out if I'm on the right path.""

That second one? That's a conversation that could actually go somewhere interesting. It signals you're a real human, not a corporate robot. And it gives the other person permission to drop their mask too.

**But here's the trick**: Lead with curiosity about them first, THEN share your vulnerability. Don't open with your problems. That's still conversation vampirism, just the sad version.

**Never Split the Difference** by Chris Voss is technically a negotiation book (he's a former FBI hostage negotiator), but it's secretly the best book on conversations you'll ever read. Voss teaches tactical empathy, how to make people feel understood so deeply that they open up. One technique: labeling emotions. ""It sounds like you're frustrated about that"" or ""Seems like that was exciting for you."" Simple but crazy effective at deepening conversations.

## Step 5: Learn to Story-Tell Like You Give a Damn

When you DO share your own experiences, don't just recite facts. Paint a picture. Include sensory details. Build tension. Have a point.

Bad storytelling: ""I went to Japan last year. It was cool. The food was good.""

Better storytelling: ""So I'm in Tokyo, jet lagged as hell, wandering around at 3am because I can't sleep. I turn this corner and there's a tiny ramen shop, like 6 seats total, run by this 80 year old man. No English menu, no pictures. I just pointed at what the guy next to me was eating. Best meal of my life. Turns out the old man had been making that same ramen for 50 years. That's when I realized...""

See the difference? The second one takes you there. It has stakes, imagery, a revelation. Even if it's a small story, tell it like it matters.

## Step 6: Kill Your Filler Words and Dead Energy

Nothing murders conversational energy faster than ""um,"" ""like,"" ""you know,"" ""basically"" every three seconds. It makes you sound uncertain and uninteresting.

Record yourself talking for 5 minutes. Just ramble about your day into your phone. Then listen back. You'll be horrified at how many filler words you use. Awareness is the first step to killing them.

**Replace fillers with pauses**. Silence isn't your enemy. A confident pause is way more engaging than a string of ""ums."" It makes people lean in.

Also, watch your energy. If you're monotone, people will tune out no matter how interesting your words are. Vary your pace, your volume, your tone. Emphasis matters. You're not reading a grocery list, you're creating an experience.

## Step 7: Ask Questions That Actually Slap

Boring questions get boring answers. ""What do you do?"" ""Where are you from?"" These are conversation killers disguised as conversation starters.

Instead, ask questions that make people think:
- ""What's something you believed five years ago that you don't believe anymore?""
- ""If you could only keep one hobby for the rest of your life, which one and why?""
- ""What's a problem you're trying to solve right now?""

These questions bypass small talk and go straight to interesting territory. They force the other person to actually engage their brain instead of running on autopilot.

**Build a rotation of 10-15 killer questions** and deploy them strategically. Don't machine gun them, just have them ready when small talk is dying.

## Step 8: Know When to Shut Up and Exit Gracefully

Here's an underrated skill: knowing when a conversation has run its course. Some people try to squeeze every last drop out of an interaction and it gets painful.

If the energy's dropping, don't force it. You can gracefully exit with: ""This was great, I'm gonna grab another drink but let's continue this later"" or ""I should let you get back to your people, but seriously, what you said about [topic] really got me thinking.""

Leave them wanting more instead of exhausting the interaction. Mystery and brevity can actually make you MORE interesting than oversharing.

The ultimate cheat code? Genuinely care about people. Not in a fake, manipulative way. Actually be curious about humans. When you're authentically interested in someone's world, conversations stop being performances and start being connections.

**Chapter 8: Free Market Research**

**Memory Transcription: Shahab Al-Furusi, SafeHerd Board Member**  
**Date \[standardized human time\]: November 5, 2136**  
**Location: Dayside City, Venlil Prime**

I woke up to two emails that made it very difficult to do my usual slow, coffee assisted booting.

The first was an email Sarah had forwarded me from the United Nations Bulletin, marked OFFICIAL NOTICE - CAPITAL CONTROLS:

*Emergency Order 2136-FC-09: Temporary restrictions on private human capital transfers to Venlil Prime, effective immediately. Private individuals prohibited from land acquisition or capital transfers exceeding 10M UNC to or from Alien Markets pending regulatory framework development. Duration: 12-18 months, extendible by discretion until proper regulatory frameworks are established.*

*Justification: Protection of human investors from systemic harm in former federation worlds in light of recent unfortunate events.*

I didn’t need to read Sarah’s notes to see the elegant misdirection. They'd framed it as protecting humans from exploitation by sophisticated aliens. The real target was obvious: me specifically. High-net-worth individual with VP land holdings, recently ""pressured"" into selling to the Nevok-Venlil firm SafeHerd at “unfavorable” terms. The narrative wrote itself. 

Containment. Clean, defensible, aesthetically pleasing. The kind of authoritarian action that is paternalistic in just the right way to come off as aesthetically pleasing in press releases.

I didn’t really get to dwell on it much because of the Qatar Investment Authority’s encrypted message notification. 

I opened the app, did the three types of secondary authentication it always asked for, and began reading the message from good old Khalid.

From: *Khalid al-Rumaihi, Qatar Investment Authority, Strategic Investments Division.*

*Shahab,*

*Congratulations on your SafeHerd transaction. 30x returns in such a short time demonstrates remarkable execution.* 

*We are analyzing Venlil Prime as an institutional investment target. UN capital controls restrict private individuals. They do not restrict qualified institutional investors with proper compliance frameworks. We can move capital. You cannot. not at scale.*

*We would like to explore investment opportunities on Venlil Prime. You have operational knowledge and have demonstrated capability at reading the local market.*

*Further, we wanted to know your thoughts on the currently circulating UN memo with regards to Venlil Prime.* 

*Attached: UN Inspector General assessment of VP institutional architecture. Level 4 classification, obtained through diplomatic channels. Read Section VI specifically. We discuss in 24 hours.*

*K. al-Rumaihi*

Classic investor behaviour: Offer value, while also always trying to extract analysis and information. Sending some reports and asking for an analysis was so venture capitalist that it made me think of … the good old days. 

I wasn’t ready for the words that greeted me when I opened the attachment.

**CLASSIFIED - LEVEL 4**  
**OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL**  
**RE: Venlil Prime - Structural Assessment & Reform Mandate Request**

Interesting provenance. They weren’t just asking for analysis, this was also a demonstration of their superior … everything. Almost an act of intimidation, though I know it wasn’t even meant as such. A display of supreme authority without saying a single word that compels you to do anything.

 I also wondered if this was obtained using methods that are just barely legal, or simply illicitly through informants, bribes and backdoors. No matter. 

Fascinating, nonetheless.

The memo was comprehensive. Forty pages of economic analysis, institutional assessment, and reform proposals. I skimmed the early sections. economic baseline, guild capture, Federation dependency legacy. All accurate from what I could tell. The analysis also covered some things I had not considered and looked at stuff I had not from the perspective of an engineer, but that of a regulator.

Then Section IV stopped me.

*Pattern: Purchase of ""contaminated"" land at \~1% of pre-contamination value, followed by resale or settlement threats creating public pressure. Timing suggests possible coordination with alien entities (SafeHerd) to maximize mutual benefit. Human creates threat, alien entity provides protection, both profit.*

*While a preponderance of reasons make me assume some degree of collusion or cartel behaviour with SafeHerd, it is not currently provable beyond circumstantial suspicion, and the cost benefit ratio of going after SafeHerd prohibits any such action.*

She'd seen it. The coordination pattern. Damn. Or more correctly, she had seen something. I kept on reading, just a bit tense, somewhat anxious and decidedly excited.

The next section boiled off the less pleasant parts of the mix.

She'd misread what she'd seen. Or rather, she had properly used Occam’s razor to go for the rational possibility that required the fewest assumptions.

Cartel behavior: two separate entities coordinating for mutual benefit. 

I looked at the progression of the events to reconstruct her logic. I did enjoy this mental exercise, even though I was certain it was also useful. 

*S*hahab Al-Furūsī begins purchasing ""contaminated"" land at \~1% of pre-human value through an aggressive and professionally famous local attorney, Yipilion. They make inflammatory public statements about human settlement rights.  The campaign is loud, threatening, predatory.

Simultaneously, SafeHerd Mutual Aid Trust launches. Nevok-backed charity offering protection against human predation. Membership surges with each Al-Furūsī land purchase. SafeHerd positions as defender of Venlil interests. Begins buying land to ""protect"" it from human expansion.

The two entities are on collision course. Public confrontation seems inevitable.

Then: settlement. Al-Furūsī sells his holdings to SafeHerd. Price is thirty times his purchase cost. He makes a fortune. But still only one-third of pre-contamination value. He appears ""pressured"" into accepting less than properties are worthbecause of media campaigns, negative PR, workers refusing to work his land, and finally, the venlil parliament incentivizing different development avenues.

SafeHerd gets the land, a grand PR victory, and even brings him in with a symbolic-looking board seat that he can only leverage through a Venlil attorney to get a further discount. Framed as charitable, closing the threat of the human owning massive land he can use in the future, while doing everything to spend the least amount possible and avoid an ugly confrontation that would be un-prey-like. 

*In the end though, Both entities profit enormously.* 

This of course could happen via market forces alone. But there was just enough details to make her unproven accusation of cartel behaviour ring true:

 

Al-Furusi buys just enough land that, when combined with SafeHerd, nets SafeHerd two parliamentary seat thresholds. Never more, but explainable as him not wanting to go into the parliament and cause a diplomatic incident.

 The land he buys is always optimally positioned for SafeHerd’s use as well, he never tries to expand away from them.

The timings of every beat of the whole arc are always reasonably good for both parties.

Al-Furusi makes no attempt at concealing his plans or creating a fait-accompli.

All of this made it so that the suspicion was rational. We had considered the PR and what we had done, but never how everything would look when someone focused on the pattern and put all our actions, with a timestamp, next to what we could have done and did not do. 

Of course, nothing she had was more than a suspicion. She could not indict anyone, even if she had the authority. She barely had enough for a subpoena to a compliant jurisdiction, and Nevoks, especially with half of the earth’s metal imports routing through them, were not going to be easily compliant with something that could create bad precedent for themselves. I doubted that she would even try it.

But she saw coordination between separate actors. Two entities, mutual benefit, balanced power dynamics. She'd have no framework for single operation creating institutional distance for political safety. 

The beauty was that every element was real. The purchases happened. The confrontation happened. The profits happened. The only thing that was theater was the conflict itself. We weren't two entities coordinating: we were one operation creating institutional distance and handling two puppets. 

This was the major silver lining: I still had the information asymmetry advantage. She had seen some evidence, and drew a directionally correct but ultimately wrong conclusion. I had to take maximal advantage and try my best to reinforce it.

Which closed the loop and brought me back to QIA. Sarah and I had considered it early on as a political shield, but now, we could do it cleanly and defensibly: Frame it as Nevok partners having brought in an immensely rich human for the capital, and now realizing he can’t deploy his earth assets. Their “pressure” making me run back to my daddies in the middle eastern sovereign funds was easy to spin, and explained why SafeHerd, despite having a lot of capital, would nonetheless bring in outside capital; It was the Nevok-Venlil SafeHerd’s own capital, and I needed to show my worth to them somehow.

 

I skimmed to Section VI, and then actually had to start to pace around the room to contain my excitement.

**A. Primary Request: Institutional Reform Mandate**

*Scope: Comprehensive assessment and reform partnership with Venlil government covering:*

*1. Financial & Economic Institutions*  
*- Banking regulation and central bank modernization*  
*- Insurance/financial products regulatory framework*  
*- Securities exchange and capital markets infrastructure*  
*- Anti-monopoly and competition law*

*2. Administrative Capacity*  
*- Civil service professionalization*  
*- Regulatory agency establishment*  
*- Anti-corruption frameworks*

*3. Economic Diversification*  
*- Industrial development incentives*  
*- Guild reform (opening market access)*  
*- Innovation support infrastructure*

*Timeline: 90-day diagnostic, 180-day reform roadmap, 12-month initial implementation, 24-month capacity transfer.*

I read it three times.

She'd written a product roadmap. Every institutional gap in VP's economy. Every service the planet needed. Banking infrastructure, credit facilities, trade coordination, securities markets, guild alternatives. All validated by UN assessment, backed by anticipated Venlil government cooperation, scheduled for implementation.

Three years to build public institutions from scratch.

I pulled up SafeHerd's current position on my second screen:

* 304B UNC in capital, after buying me out and committing billions to Yotul administration and developing the human zones with all necessary construction and logistics because of our government-licensed monopoly contract.  
* Parliamentary seat via Talvi, second one to be filled by Yipilion in the immediate future because buying me out brought us over the threshold. 
* Administrative authority over Protected Development Zone
* Operational logistics network through the Yotul 
* Complete monopoly of supplying human settlements in the urban zones of the planet.

We could build everything in Section VI through SafeHerd. Ostensibly mutually owned instead of government-run… and we probably could do it faster.

She'd identified the gaps, validated institutional necessity, and handed us the timeline to beat her to market. 

I scheduled the team meeting for two hours later, giving everyone time to read the memo. Same encrypted channels as always.

""Capital controls,"" I said without preamble. ""I can't move significant capital to VP anymore. Can't fund expansion directly. Can't access my own wealth for operations here.""

“My good sir, how does it feel to join us here at the level of the normal venlil, with only a meagre dozen Billion credits in the bank?” Yipilion quipped, good humoredly, but then pondered and added, more as a recap than anything else: “Though of course, I can see the containment. This UN of yours is indeed trying to contain our little operation in some way. A cap on capitalizing it further through you will bite next year, when fewer people buy Human Predation insurance”.

 

""Yes. I cannot move capital, but ‘We’ can. Institutional investors are exempt. Some sovereign funds, that is, investors that work on behalf of human nations, have approached me about leading their VP infrastructure investment. They are … immensely rich, and legally nigh untouchable.""

I brought the memo. ""Read Section VI if you haven’t yet. Honestly, re-read it even if you have so it’s fresh on your minds. Then we'll talk.""

Silence as they read. I watched their reactions.

Yipilion finished first, ears flicking with what I'd learned to recognize as his version of amusement. ""She's planning three years of comprehensive reform. Diagnostic phase, design phase, implementation, capacity transfer.""

""Correct.""

""The Magistratum will be thrilled. Endless committees, studies, deliberations. They can perform reform enthusiasm for three years while changing nothing substantive. Perfect political cover to do exactly nothing while looking ever so dutiful.""

Talvi looked up from her pad. ""That's not quite fair. The Magistratum isn't obstructing. They genuinely think the system works. VP functioned for centuries under Federation frameworks. They see current crisis as external shock requiring adaptation, not systemic failure requiring rebuilding.""

""Which means?"" I prompted.

""Which means they'll cooperate enthusiastically with her diagnostic phase. Provide data, attend meetings, assign liaisons. Because they think her assessment will validate existing structures with minor modifications. When she proposes comprehensive reform, they'll be shocked. Then they'll slow-walk implementation because they fundamentally disagree that it's necessary.""

Yipilion chimed back in, more seriously:

“My esteemed colleague is correct to an extent, but Talvi, you are focusing far too much on the lawmakers in the parliament and what happens here in the. Not an attack, it’s just that I know you have not done too much work in the weeds of the local administration. The provincial magistratum has plenty of Venlil who are competent in enforcing the law, but major reforms are not a thing anybody has ever done. What I said, half-jokingly, will describe the most cynical employees. For others, this is something they haven’t done before and is outside their skillset. They might also not see the objectives, without being educated. And while I’m sure they can be brought up to speed, that needs time and resources.”

""So her three-year timeline is optimistic,"" Sarah observed from the screen.

""Her three-year timeline assumes willing government partners,"" Talvi corrected. ""She'll have cooperative partners who don't share her diagnosis. Much harder, and …""

“And of course, if the government here, in the capital doesn’t push it hard and assign personnel and come up with goals to hit, nobody will do anything when you go out into further regions, where upstanding Venlil who still have the fear of predators deeply embedded in them live. ” Yipilion finished it for her.

That was exactly what I had been half-hoping for, half expecting from intuition about Venlil Prime.

I leaned forward. ""Which is why we need to move now. Here's what I'm proposing:""

I pulled up the operational framework I'd been drafting.

""Section VI identifies institutional gaps. We build them through SafeHerd before she can implement public alternatives.""

""Specifically?"" Sarah asked.

""Banking and credit infrastructure. We have billions in float and hundreds of million members with transaction history. More importantly, we are trusted. We offer member business loans at rates forty percent below guild lenders. eight percent instead of fourteen. Use membership data for credit assessment. Payment history, transaction patterns, herd standing. Build a credit rating system based on actual behavior instead of guild reputation networks. But would ordinary Venlil take it?""

""My man, of course they would. I think you need a few more days down here, without your hundreds of billions, to understand the life of ordinary Venlil” Yipilion whistled, then continued: “More importantly, however, the guilds will resist, which means some in the magistratum and the parliament will try to make it harder. We will certainly lose some good will within the government”.

""That should be fine. We're not attacking guilds. We're offering members better terms. I’m sure we can frame it in some way…”

“It’s not about framing though, they will see through any framing” Yipilion interrupted. Fair point, framing could only go so far.

“But we can raise the political cost of opposing it by making the narrative as nice and charitable as possible. That should at least make it harder for them to directly obstruct us” Talvi added. “It is, after all, something that would realistically help Venlil.”

""Logistics coordination,"" I continued. ""The Yotul Herd Protection program proves we can run supply chains without the Transport Guild. We expand that model. SafeHerd members get access to our logistics network. Undercut guild delivery rates by thirty percent. Volume makes up for the margin.""

""Trade certification and standards. Guilds monopolize quality certification. We create SafeHerd standards authority. Members can get certified through us instead of waiting months for guild approval.""

Talvi's tail was swaying thoughtfully. ""You're building parallel guilds.""

""I'm building the infrastructure Restrepo identified as necessary. It happens to compete with guilds because guilds currently monopolize these functions.""

""And the Yotul administration? We're already committed to it,"" she asked.

""The canton is perfect for this. Proof of concept, early adopters. Plus it solves a market access problem I've been thinking about.""

""Which is?"" Talvi prompted.

""Human consumer goods. Federation species are ahead of us in physics, materials science, engines, we're playing catch-up there. But human consumer goods? Food, decorations, furniture, musical instruments, clothing, recreational items? We're far ahead. And vastly cheaper. A human-made wooden table costs a tenth of what a Venlil guild charges for equivalent quality. And don’t get me started on your art and sport supply prices.""

""Venlil won't buy human products,"" Yipilion observed. ""Contamination concerns.""

""Exactly. But what if we bring in massive amounts of human consumer goods. I mean items like furniture, decorations, instruments, textiles. Yotul workers in the canton assemble final products, do finishing work, add modifications. Then we market it as Yotul-made goods. 'Quaint old-timey aesthetic.' 'Exotic human wood worked by traditional Yotul craftsmanship.' Technically accurate, and generally, deniable through Yotul. With the tools and the parts, they may even make their own goods too”

Talvi's ears went up. ""You're laundering human goods through Yotul labor.""

""I'm creating employment for a marginalized population while giving Venlil access to affordable consumer goods they currently can't get because guild pricing is absurd and human products are culturally rejected. The fact that it happens to move human manufacturing into VP markets is just... market efficiency.""

Yipilion's tail flicked with what I'd learned meant he was impressed despite himself. ""The Venlil will pay premium for 'Yotul craftsmanship' that's actually cheap human base materials with Yotul finishing. Brilliant.""

“I can’t take full credit. The laundering and moral shielding is an old idea from a human civilization, really. But I will not lecture now, we should finish this up” I added, forcing myself to not launch into a lecture about East Asian trade practices and how they had inspired my proposal.

Sarah's voice cut through. ""Timeline?""

""Six months to operational infrastructure. QIA provides extra capital, with a political shield as a too-big-to-attack-visibly benefactor, we provide execution. By the time Restrepo's diagnostic phase completes, we're already offering these services to members.""

""And what happens to her public institution mandate?"" Talvi asked quietly.

""She finds functioning infrastructure already serving sixteen percent of the population, likely more since we’ll grow with other services. She can regulate us. But building parallel public institutions while ours are operational? It would make it even more… politically difficult. Economically disruptive. She’d be told that it’s easier to regulate what exists than dismantle it for public alternatives.""

Silence.

""This is a significant escalation,"" Talvi finally said. ""We're moving from insurance arbitrage to institutional infrastructure.""

""We're building what her memo identifies as necessary infrastructure. If that happens to position us advantageously, that's proper business planning.""

""How much capital?"" Sarah asked.

""Initial estimate: 250 billion UNC. I'm proposing we approach QIA and suggest they structure as a consortium across multiple Gulf sovereign funds. Spreads exposure, increases political protection.""

Yipilion's ears went flat. Not fear, as far as I could tell, more like professional assessment. ""That's institutional scale. That makes us extremely visible.""

""Can't be helped. The window is time-limited. Restrepo's memo gives us six to twelve months before UN implementation begins. We either move now or lose the first-mover advantage.""

""The parliamentary seats help,"" Yipilion added. ""Difficult to frame as foreign extraction when I'm sitting in assembly representing member interests. When I take the second seat, even more so.""

""Exactly.""

Talvi looked at me directly. ""The guilds won't just resist. They'll fight. They'll use every political connection, every regulatory lever, every cultural argument they have.""

""I know.""

""And Restrepo will regulate us aggressively once she realizes what we're doing.""

""I expect she will. But she'll regulate functioning infrastructure, not dismantle it. That's the play.""

Sarah's voice came through clearly. ""Legal disclaimer: the capital controls already targeted you specifically. 250 billion flowing in immediately after makes it extremely clear you're still operational despite restrictions. Just want to make sure you do understand this.""

""Noted.""

""Good. Then structure: QIA should do a consortium with a few more sovereign funds, though I expect they 100% will do it to spread exposure and make themselves even more threatening to go against. investment flows into Pan-Prey, then to SafeHerd for specific infrastructure projects. Full documentation, transparent accounting, regulatory compliance from day one. If we're this visible, we stay legally bulletproof. If asked, you’ll say Nevok partners at SafeHerd pressured you because of the capital controls.""

""Agreed. Timeline for term sheet?""

""Seventy-two hours to draft. Khalid will want a formal proposal before bringing it to the QIA board.""

I waited for the usual Sarah warnings. The three-part risk assessment. The 'are you absolutely certain’. The defensive disclaimers.

It didn't come. Nothing came.

""Anything else?"" I asked.

Yip and Sarah stayed silent. I could see that Yip was excited. Sarah didn’t seem to be reacting much at all, which was … confusing and intriguing in equal measure.

Talvi's voice was soft but firm. ""I don’t really have any objections. I do trust your understanding and Sarah’s legal expertise on exposure management. Just, understand the scale. This isn't land arbitrage anymore. You're trying to own the institutional infrastructure of a planet before the UN and the local government can build public alternatives. That's... ambitious even by your standards.""

I met her eyes through the screen. ""I didn't come to Venlil Prime to be a landlord. The UN loves calling me a rentseeker, well probably, I’ve never read anything they say about me, but I’m in this to build something massive. Restrepo's memo confirms I was right about the diagnosis. And it hands me the treatment plan.""

""You think you can execute better than the UN.""

""I think I can execute faster. And I claim that in institution building, first-mover advantage is everything.""

She held my gaze for a long moment. Then nodded.

""Then let's build it.""

\---

I spent the next eighteen hours preparing the proposal. Not just financial projections, but also operational plans: Specific infrastructure projects, timelines, resource requirements, risk assessments. Even for me, widely seen as their golden boy, QIA wouldn't fund based on handshake and vision. They'd want a concrete execution framework.

Sarah sent legal structure drafts. Yipilion provided political risk assessment. Talvi outlined regulatory coordination strategy as well as a guideline on parliamentary and national government framing of everything. 

Around hour fifteen, I called Sarah to discuss a structural detail about the Pan-Prey investment flow. But, before getting to it, I had to get something off my mind.

""One thing I'm surprised about,"" I said. ""I expected more pushback from you. This is massive escalation, massive visibility, exactly the kind of thing you usually warn me about fifteen times before letting me proceed. Mention how it’s a rushed idea, or how I should not delude myself into thinking a course of action I want to pursue, which makes some sense, is optimal.""

There was a pause.

""Shahab. You didn't read my email, did you?""

""I read the capital controls…""

""You read the forwarded bulletin. Did you read the three pages of analysis I attached below it?""

I pulled up the original email. Scrolled down past the UN bulletin.

There were indeed three pages of analysis. The first page was titled: ""Capital Controls as Containment - Why Escalation is Our Only Option.""

""Ah.""

""I wrote that at 4 AM after seeing the capital controls announcement. I knew you'd call the team meeting. I knew you'd propose some sort of escalation. And I wanted you to know I agreed before you even pitched it.""

""You... already thought this through.""

""Shahab, everyone from Earth knows how containment ends. USSR. Slow strangulation until collapse. The capital controls are step one. If we don't break out now, there's step two, step three. Each one tightens until we either fold or get squeezed out completely. Besides, she did this to force you to act in some way. Become desperate and make mistakes. The only way to not play into it is to maintain the initiative""

""So you wanted me to escalate.""

""No, I wanted you to understand that escalating is the only rational move. Best case: we build the infrastructure, own it, and when Restrepo arrives she has to work with us instead of investigating us. We curb her completely. she becomes the regulator of our institutions rather than the builder of competing ones.""

""And worst case?""

""Average case first. Average case: we try, she still regulates us heavily, but we have operational leverage. We end up with more leverage than today, due to partial success. We're providing services to millions of members. She has to negotiate with us and accommodate us to some extent, because shutting us down means economic disruption. That's infinitely better than sitting in containment waiting for her to build her frameworks and then investigate us when we have no leverage at all.""

""And worst case?""

“We are in the same position as today. Contained, waiting to take out our current cash, vulnerable, but ultimately, that is the status quo. As long as we make sure we don’t commit anything undeniably criminal while building, we can maintain the status quo even in the worst case scenario.”

Huh. I guess I had been so excited about this that I hadn’t really considered why escalation was a good move at a meta level, just that this particular move was correct. It was interesting, though, that she had done so much analysis already:

“So you have been planning this.”

""I've been planning contingencies since you… sold to SafeHerd. The capital controls were predictable at a meta level, ie, the UN doing something, even if they bought the story fully. The QIA partnership was a logical step we had discussed. I started building the legal structure two weeks ago.""

""From when we first discussed it? That would’ve been a different situation no?”

""The proposal framework I sent you? I drafted that yesterday. After I saw the controls. Before you called the meeting. You've been preparing the pitch. I've been preparing the structure. You also still have auto forward on investor tagged messages for me. It was encrypted, but I saw the notif that QIA had sent you a message. You really should turn that off by the way.""

I laughed, noting her half-joking warning. I then sat back in my chair. ""You've been three steps ahead of me this entire time.""

""Four steps. Also, read my emails. All of them. I don't attach three pages of analysis for decoration. I know you won’t always do it, nor am I upset, to be clear. If anything, I found it amusing that you kept glancing at what I assumed was my video-tile and waiting for me to admonish you.""

""Noted."", I said, trying to project an appropriate level of shame, while secretly being proud of my attorney. Not even at a ‘I chose her well level’, just appreciating the competence. 

""Good. Now finish the operations section. You call Khalid in six hours. I want this proposal polished.""

The call ended.

I pulled up her full email and started reading the analysis I should have read eighteen hours ago. She'd mapped the entire play. containment logic, escalation necessity, QIA partnership structure, even timeline estimates for when we'd need to be operational.

She hadn’t seen this coming, sure. But she had done something even better. She had understood the pattern of what would happen, and thus she had been preparing for the whole broad array of scenarios. She had then reacted to the specific event while I was still reading the capital controls.

Inspector General Restrepo had written us a product roadmap.

But Sarah had written us the execution plan.

And QIA was about to fund it.

So I've been travelling for the last month, and I gotta tell you it absolutely SUCKS. I hate travelling.

I am visiting family, and staying at their house (instead of a rental where I usually stay - hey, money is tight you do what you gotta do). 

I have the freedom to cook what I want, but of course if I don't eat what they make everyone gets butt-hurt.

And there are temptations all over the place! Seriously. 

I just got back, and grabbed a black coffee from McDs and couldn't finish it all by the time I got home.

Get to my relatives place, and the table has a container of chips on it. A box of cookies... and another container of Christmas cake.

Temptations are abound, and while I have good self-control I really gotta bite myself to keep away from all that.

Out of sight, out of mind is the best policy but unfortunately when you are staying with someone, that's not always possible and that's when self-control is so critical.

It would be so easy to blow my diet in one sitting. All it would take if a few cookies, maybe a slice of Christmas cake and a handful of potato chips and I'd probably top 1,000 calories and 100g of carbs (actually, probably more - and when I say Christmas cake, I'm referring to Fruit Cake. I usually only see it around Christmas time).

The problem is when you're on vacation, and staying with family it's so hard to maintain your caloric deficit. Although I've been pretty firm, given culture it's very easy to offend them.

Thankfully tomorrow is my last day here, I'm visiting a friend and then I'm back home and can back to eating properly, get back to my daily walking and cycling.

What can you do?

Drink LOTS of water. I've been trying to get at least 2l of water daily. I'm still having black tea/coffee much to their complaints and whenever I can I hit the shopping centre and walk because it's too damn cold to go for a walk outside and sidewalks are covered in snow.

hey again posting here, I am looking for someone to go out on the Halloween night in Bangalore

about me: 30 (soon to be 31), working in tech in bangalore. quiet, low-drama guy who enjoys cafes, long walks, lazy sundays and real convos more than parties or small talk. into photography, 3d design and small web/homelab projects. i’ve spent the last few years focusing on skills and hobbies, so i’m new to dating but ready to try.

why i’m here: dating apps felt shallow and too hookup-heavy. most weekends i just end up scrolling, and i want to change that. i’m looking for something real, honest and slow-build.

what i’m like:

calm and thoughtful, listen more than i talk

loyal, not into drama

prefer 1 on 1 stuff: coffee/tea, parks, long walks, late night talks

creative and curious, like building/learning random skills

what i’m looking for: someone kind, emotionally mature and curious. more than that, i want a partner, not an echo.

on vibe: you don’t have to agree on everything to connect. a person is always bigger than one opinion. i value honesty and the freedom to be ourselves. i’ll respect your worldview and i’m looking for someone who’ll do the same.

if your instinct when you disagree is to shut down or dismiss, we won’t match. but if you can see the whole person and handle differences with curiosity instead of judgment, that’s what i’m after.

last thing: i’d rather hear “hey this isn’t a vibe” than deal with ghosting. clear and kind endings > confusion.

if this feels like your vibe, say hi and tell me one of these: fav cafe, ideal lazy weekend, or a song you can’t stop replaying. reply or dm, no pressure.

It was about a mom and her teenage daughter living in a snowy town they have a good relationship with each other . There was a scene at the beginning when the mom and her daughter were shopping in a gasstation and the daughter trying to convince her mom to buy her a coffee cake and her mom say its going to make her stay up all night. The daughter then asks her mother if she can go play in the snow with board and then it goes to her slipping on the snow with her board and then a car comes and hit her. The guy who hit her was drinking and didn't want to call the police or emergency services so he drags her body into his car and takes her home and put her in a bathtub I think then she wakes up and he panics and he drowns /chocking her(?). Meanwhile the mom is worried because her daughter didn't come home so she is looking for her everywhere. The man who hits her starts to see the ghost of the girl he killed or maybe it was his guilt. I remember that in the end the mom finds the man who killed her daughter and she go meet him and i think she tortures him and at the end they sit facing each other at a table and the ghost of the daughter posses the man and talks to her mom in his his voice through him.

I woke up today like any other Tuesday. I had to run to work in a hurry (I’m starting to think I should budget for an assistant since my wife won’t help) but I would never skip my shower. I grabbed a bud light from the fridge… nothing is more relaxing than a cold beer in a hot shower in the morning! I work hard! I’ve earned a beer in the morning! It’s just a bud light, nothing extreme. 

The cold can sweats on the shelf of my hot shower as I run a bit of conditioner through my beard. My daughter’s new coconut conditioner smells delicious! I don’t usually even like coconut, but I had to try it. It felt like melted butter in my mouth like those awful olive oil coffees. I hurried and chugged about half of the can to undo whatever I’d just done, and that’s when I *finally* relaxed enough to uncrunch my shoulders. I’m never allowed anything nice, so *of course* that’s when my wife knocked on the door. It was just to cut my shower short and I know it. I told her I was busy, but she insisted. She said it was an emergency and that cops were at our door. 

Oh, great. Fucking Brittany. I shouldn’t be surprised! She hates that I have 50/50 custody and the poor bloke who knocked her up has been begging her to fight for full custody for all 6 years of their poor, bastard child’s life. He wants to be close to his family, he says. So do I, but I actually care about my sons. I guess he must have threatened to leave her, or maybe he finally got the balls to do it. But police don’t deliver court notices unless it’s something more…

She’s filed abuse charges against me again. She must have. I won last time because I was right! I don’t know why it’s so surprising to me that she’d try again, of course she’d do this before filing for custody.

I came to the door in just my towel. They’re wasting my time and they should know it. There were two officers there, an older man whose brow looked permanently furrowed due to the depth of his wrinkles, and some newbie who can’t even grow as much hair on his legs as I can on my chest. It looked like bring your child to work day. I respect that new cops need to be trained and I’m glad he is getting this training. Honestly? I can’t think of a better fake call to take him on. Just seeing him made it clear that even the cops knew this was bullshit.

“What did Brittany say this time?” It was hard to even say it with a straight face, but police need training and laughing in his face wouldn’t help him. This was clearly dumb enough to bring the kid.

“What?” The older cop responded.

I swear, you should be legally required to warn people if they’re part of training like this. At least tell me I am supposed to act like a criminal!

“She wants to get another fake PFA, doesn’t she? Look, I haven’t been alone with her in years and my kids can bac-“

The new cop cut me off before I could explain that I definitely didn’t do whatever he thinks. He probably believes it. Any new cop would believe Brittany’s lies.

“Do you know a woman named Kyra Miller?”

I couldn’t help but look at my wife with distain. I wouldn’t have even come to the door if I knew they were asking about Kyra. I had been done with her shit for years now. I guess she always liked to play the long game.

“My wife and I were friends with her a long time ago, but I can’t remember the last time we spoke.”

“Was it before or after court?” I misread that man. I wasn’t expecting him to be ‘bad cop.’ Maybe he’s compensating for something.

“Are you Jared Wyyyy Kehh Braaaa-“

“Weichbrodt, and yes,” I said, putting the poor lad out of his misery.

“Mind coming with us to answer a few questions?” When I glanced at the older cop, I found out exactly how he got those lines that defined his face.

“Sure, can I get dressed first?” I tried to hide my frustration but I’m sure even the kid could tell. I’ve been a man for a very long time and we’re in a culture war; I can’t be on the wrong side. A woman accused me of something! I’m basically a monster. Even monsters have rights, though, and I know I have a right to be clothed if I’m doing them a favour and sparing them the burden of getting a warrant. I did nothing wrong, they can let me get clothed or ‘cuff me.

“Your… umm…” The young cop glanced at my wife before finishing his sentence. Yeah, he’s talked to Kyra. I decided to spare him the embarrassment and said, “wife,” maybe a bit too harshly. They were talking to Kyra, who knows what she’s said!

“Yeah, she can bring clothes to you here.”

“Am I under arrest?!”

“We just need to talk.”

I don’t know what Kyra said to these men but I could tell it was bad and a load of shit. I only ever helped that girl! Still, I flashed my wife *the* look and she grabbed the clothes I had folded by the sink for after my shower. They offered to let me change privately but I don’t want them to think they’re the good guys. I can pull my boxer-briefs and jeans on under my towel like at summer camp. I don’t need their charity. I was still put in the back of their car! I guess I’m supposed to feel grateful that they didn’t have me in handcuffs.

“Am I under arrest?”

“No.” So, the real cop speaks. I can’t tell if it’s a good or a bad sign. His voice was as gruff as his face suggested.

“Then why are you putting me in the back like a criminal?!”

“The kid called shotgun.”

I couldn’t help but laugh. He clearly knows this is bullshit! Still, he passed the exit for our county police office… he’s on highway 71? We’re going to the state office. I’m sure it’s just because Kyra is living in wherever the fuck. Fucking Kyra.

Before I know it I’m in a sterile, brightly lit room and being asked all sorts of weird questions about Kyra.

“When was the last time you saw her?” It was a lady cop this time. This won’t be good.

“When she left for Minnesota.” I spoke confidently but not too harshly, I don’t want to scare her. I know how women are these days.

“Not when she went back to the house you owned, that she’d lived in for over a year? Not when you brought police over saying she was trespassing? Not when she cried in a private room with the sheriff, begging him not to make her see her ‘abusive ex boyfriend’ before taking her before a magistrate without representation? Did you see her in the brief stint of time where you weren’t out of the room with your lawyer and the magistrate?”

“What exactly are you implying?! That we ran off into the sunset?!”

“We were called to her flat because her dog was barking too loud for too long and her neighbour was worried.”

“Oh god, you think I killed her… she’d never just leave her animals alone like that!”

“That’s really interesting, considering we have you on record telling the humane society she left them alone and had before for 2 weeks.”

“Look, it’s just business. She was living in my house and not paying rent. What do you want me to say? Do I need a lawyer?”

“Are you going to call the lawyer who dropped you for lying to him in Kyra’s case?”

“I was talking to you in good faith. I can leave as I please.” I stood up and the chair echoed loudly through the almost-empty room. Before I could hear the entirety of the echo from the shitty, hollow, fake-metal chair, the child-cop walked in to stop me.

“We know you received an email from TikTok recommending her account. We know about the video where she talks about people needing to be suspicious if she’s found dead but not wearing the flash drive. We’ve seen the contents of the flash drive, and they’re all documents about your affair and your attempts to defraud the government.”

“That doesn’t mean I killed her!”

“We found the oven on at 150°F when all that was inside were the remains of a hand and 3 teeth. DNA testing confirms they’re Ky-“

“It’s the left hand, isn’t it? And only back teeth??”

“It-“

“God, that’s just like Kyra! She’s doing an um, um… a thing. She had a word for it? Fuck, I can’t think of the word! She’s doing a movie or a show or something! I think she tried to tell me about something like this once?”

“You’re not seriously suggesting she’s doing a “Gone Girl,” are you?”

“If there’s a name for it, you have your answer. Kyra was many things, but creative has never been one of them. Now, if I’m not under arrest, I’d like to be going now. Thank you for wasting my time! I’m sure the 83-year-old woman in 3A would love to hear about how some stupid bitch from my past was playing games and that’s why she’s about to learn how to swim instead of having her flooding fixed.”

As I walked out of the doors of the state police office, I had two thoughts: “maybe I should have found another lawyer” and “I’m fucked.”

Kyra always loved Reddit, so this next part is for her: **_Pulling your teeth is an impressive level of commitment, even for you. Your left hand?! Much less impressive. I know you’re doing a “Gone Girl” but I can’t believe you actually abandoned your dog (and, I guess, the cat) for it. That’s disgusting.

Lately, I’ve been super into the idea of exploring moments of euphoria in the life of a recently transitioned transwoman. Whether the moment is as mundane as having their name shouted out on a coffee order, or as vain as admiring how amazing they look before a night out, I think it could be a super interesting framework to follow a storyline.

I think there’s so many directions the story could take. Whether the character is in college or exploring the world of work, I would love to brainstorm with you and experiment with some ideas! One particularly interesting way of looking at it is if our heroine does not originally consider themselves trans, but has transitioned for some ulterior motive. Watching them come to terms, and even enjoy, their new life could be fascinating! 

I’m really quite flexible with a lot of the story but I do have a very strong preference for realistic slice of life. Similarly I’m open to either play a single character or GM for you, and I love OOC to flesh out the story and plan what’s next. 

I’m a pretty experienced roleplayer in the GMT timezone and tend to start my stories with quite a bit of background discussion to really flesh out characters. This can range from how they look, to what their job is, to their birthday, to what country or time period this is set - I love getting into the details. Once the story begins I tend to write third person and a few paragraphs per response, but I’m very flexible as long as the story is good!

# The Fixer's Secret: Taming My Husband

  
Chapter 1   
The rain in Manhattan didn't just fall. It assaulted the pavement, rebounding in di\*\*y, gray sheets that soaked the hem of Victoria's trench coat within seconds. She stood under the awning of The Obsidian, a private club that smelled of old money and exclusion even from the outside. Water dripped from the end of her nose. Her Manolo Blahniks were ruined. The suede was already darkening, turning a tragic shade of charcoal that would never dry back to its original dove gray.  
  
Her phone buzzed against her thigh, a violent, demanding vibration that made her stomach clench. She didn't need to look at the screen to know who it was. The pattern was as predictable as the tides.  
  
She slid the phone out of her pocket. Eleanor Sterling.  
  
Victoria pressed the green button and held the device to her ear, staring blankly at the doorman who was pretending not to see her shivering.  
  
You are late, Eleanor's voice sliced through the static of the rain. It was a voice that sounded like tearing silk. Sharp, expensive, and capable of leaving a mark.  
  
I am outside, Victoria said. Her voice was steady. It took every ounce of her years of practiced discipline to keep the tremor out of it.  
  
Get him out of there. Tonight is the night. My astrologer and the fertility specialist both agree. The window is closing, Victoria. Do not come back to the manor without my son.  
  
The line went dead.  
  
Victoria lowered the phone. She took a breath that tasted of exhaust fumes and ozone. For a second, just a split second, her mask slipped. Her eyes, usually wide and accommodating, narrowed into slits of cold, hard calculation. She looked less like a wife and more like a predator assessing a trap. But then she blinked, and the mask was back. She smoothed the lapels of her wet coat and walked toward the heavy brass doors.  
  
The security guard stepped forward. He was a wall of muscle in a suit that cost more than most people's cars. He held up a hand, palm out.  
  
Members only, miss.  
  
I am Mrs. Sterling, Victoria said.  
  
The guard didn't even check his list. He offered her a smile that was more of a sneer. Mr. Sterling is already inside. He has a guest. A Miss Elena Vance. I believe the guest list is capped for his table.  
  
The implication hung in the humid air between them. The wife was the intruder. The assistant was the guest.  
  
Victoria didn't argue. She didn't raise her voice or demand to see a manager. She simply reached into her purse and pulled out a black titanium card. The Centurion. It was heavy in her hand, cold to the touch.  
  
She didn't hand it to him. She held it up, allowing the matte black surface to catch the ambient light. It wasn't a key, but in this city, credit was the only key that mattered.  
  
""Check the account holder status, Ben,"" she said, reading his nametag with a polite, terrifying calmness. ""I believe the Centurion concierge service guarantees immediate access to partner venues regardless of capacity limits. Or should I call the concierge directly and have them explain the policy to your supervisor?""  
  
The guard hesitated. He looked at the card, then at her face. The rain was dripping off her chin, but her expression held the absolute, unshakeable confidence of someone who could buy the building. The color drained from his face.  
  
""That won't be necessary, Mrs. Sterling,"" he mumbled, stepping aside and pressing the release button under his podium.  
  
The heavy doors clicked unlocked.  
  
Victoria offered him a tight, gracious nod.  
  
""Thank you, Ben.""  
  
The elevator ride to the penthouse floor was silent. Victoria watched her reflection in the polished brass walls. She looked like a drowned rat. Her hair was plastered to her skull. Her mascara was likely smudged. But she practiced her smile. It was a specific smile. The one she used for charity galas and board meetings where she wasn't allowed to speak. It was the smile of a woman who knew her place was decorative.  
  
The elevator dinged.  
  
The doors slid open, and the sound hit her first. The clinking of crystal glasses. The low, guttural laughter of men who owned skyscrapers. The smell of Cuban cigars and aged sc\*\*ch.  
  
Victoria stepped onto the plush carpet. The room was dimly lit, illuminated mostly by the green glow of the poker tables and the amber light of the b\*r. She walked toward the main table in the center of the room.  
  
The conversation died. It didn't taper off politely. It was severed.  
  
Julian Sterling sat at the head of the table. He had discarded his jacket hours ago. His white dress shirt was unbuttoned at the collar, the sleeves rolled up to his elbows, revealing forearms that were tense with muscle. He held a tumbler of wh\*\*key in one hand and a fan of cards in the other.  
  
He looked up.  
  
His eyes were the color of a stormy sea, dark and turbulent. When they landed on her, the temperature in the room seemed to drop ten degrees. There was no welcome in his gaze. There was only a profound, exhausting irritation.  
  
Next to him sat Elena.  
  
She was wearing a dress made of silver silk that looked like liquid moonlight. It was backless, sleeveless, and likely cost more than Victoria's first car. She was leaning into Julian, her hand resting casually on his bicep. She was peeling a grape.  
  
Victoria watched as Elena lifted the grape to Julian's lips.  
  
Julian didn't pull away. He didn't eat it, but he didn't stop her. He just kept staring at Victoria, challenging her.  
  
Someone at the table whistled. A low, mocking sound.  
  
Victoria felt the heat rise up her neck. It wasn't embarrassment. It was rage. A hot, molten rage that she had been swallowing for three years. She forced it down, packing it into the box in her ch\*\*t where she kept all the insults.  
  
She walked forward. Her wet heels made a squishing sound on the marble border of the floor before she hit the carpet.  
  
Elena gasped dramatically. She pulled her hand back, dropping the grape onto the green felt of the table.  
  
Oh! Victoria! Elena's voice was breathless, sugary. I didn't see you there. Julian was just winning a hand. We were celebrating.  
  
Victoria stopped directly behind Elena's chair. She could smell Elena's perfume. It was gardenias. Sickeningly sweet.  
  
She placed a hand on the back of Elena's chair.  
  
Who let you in? Julian's voice was a low rumble. Get out.  
  
Victoria ignored him. She bent down, bringing her face close to Elena's ear. Elena stiffened.  
  
Victoria's hand slid from the chair down to Elena's bare arm. Her fingers wrapped around Elena's elbow.  
  
She squeezed.  
  
It wasn't a fight move. It was a clumsy, overly tight grip that accidentally-on-purpose pressed directly onto the ulnar nerve-the funny bone. A sharp, electric shock of numbness shot down Elena's arm.  
  
Elena yelped, her hand jerking spasmodically and knocking her ch\*\*pagne flute over. The crystal shattered, and w\*\*e soaked the green felt.  
  
""Oh, dear,"" Victoria said, her voice dripping with faux concern as she released the arm. ""You seem jumpy, Elena. Too much caffeine?""  
  
She leaned in closer, her wet hair brushing Elena's cheek.  
  
An assistant should know her place, Elena, Victoria whispered. Her voice was so low only the two of them could hear it. It was devoid of the warmth she usually faked. It was the voice of the woman who knew exactly how to dismantle a reputation without leaving a fingerprint. Do not sit in my seat again.  
  
She straightened up. She smoothed her wet coat and looked at her husband.  
  
Your mother called, she said. Her voice was loud enough for the table to hear now. She wants you home, Sterling.  
  
Julian threw his cards onto the table. They scattered across the felt. A pair of Kings and a pair of Aces. A winning hand.  
  
He stood up.  
  
He was tall. Looming. He cast a shadow over her that felt physical. He reached out and grabbed her chin, his fingers digging into her jaw. He tilted her head back, forcing her to look at him.  
  
You think bringing Eleanor into this gives you power? he hissed. You think you can walk in here, dripping wet, and order me around like a dog?  
  
I am fulfilling the contract, Julian, Victoria said. Her heart was hammering against her ribs like a trapped bird, but she kept her eyes locked on his.  
  
Contract, he sneered. He released her face with a shove that made her stumble back a step.  
  
He sat back down. He picked up his glass and drained it.  
  
Deal the next hand, he said to the dealer. And get security to clear the room of tr\*\*h.  
  
The dealer hesitated, looking at Victoria.  
  
Julian slammed the glass down. I said deal!  
  
Victoria stood there. The laughter around the table started up again, nervous at first, then louder. They were laughing at her. The wet wife. The unwanted burden. The walking incubator.  
  
She felt the water from her coat dripping onto her ankles. She felt the eyes of every man in the room stripping her of her dignity.  
  
But she didn't leave.  
  
She reached into her pocket and touched her phone. She felt the cold metal casing.  
  
You want to play games, Julian? she thought.  
  
She turned her back to the table, but she didn't walk toward the exit. She walked toward the b\*r.  
  
  
  
Chapter 2   
Victoria stood by the mahogany b\*r, her back to the poker table. She could feel Julian's gaze on her shoulder bl\*\*es. It felt like a laser burn. She ordered a sparkling water, her hands trembling slightly as she accepted the glass.  
  
She took a sip and surveyed the room. In the corner, near the humidor, stood a group of young men. They were Hosts. Beautiful, paid companions that the club kept on retainer for the bored wives or the lonely widows who frequented the afternoon tea sessions.  
  
Victoria pulled out her phone. She typed a message to Zoe.  
  
Plan B. Now.  
  
Three dots appeared instantly. Then a reply. He is outside. Green tie.  
  
Victoria waited. Two minutes. Three.  
  
The elevator doors opened. Zoe walked in, looking like a chaotic storm of red hair and designer silk. Trailing behind her was a man who looked like he had been sculpted out of caramel and sin.  
  
Leo.  
  
He was tall, with eyes the color of amber and a smile that could melt glaciers. He spotted Victoria and immediately corrected his course.  
  
Victoria! Zoe shouted, waving frantically. What a coincidence!  
  
The poker table quieted down again. Julian didn't turn around, but his shoulders stiffened.  
  
Victoria turned, putting on her best surprise face. Zoe! And... Leo?  
  
Leo reached her in three strides. He took her hand and ki\*\*ed the knuckles. Mrs. Sterling. You look... damp.  
  
I got caught in the storm, Victoria said, laughing. It was a light, tinkling sound that felt foreign in her throat.  
  
Leo frowned. He took off his velvet blazer without asking and draped it over her shoulders. It was warm and smelled of expensive cologne.  
  
Better? he asked.  
  
Much, Victoria said. She leaned into him, letting the jacket envelope her. Why don't you join me?  
  
She led him not to a quiet corner, but to the railing that separated the b\*r area from the poker pit. She hopped up onto a high stool, and Leo stood between her knees, leaning against the railing.  
  
From this angle, Julian had a direct line of sight to them.  
  
Victoria signaled the bartender. ch\*\*pagne. Two glasses.  
  
Leo leaned in close. Is that him? he whispered.  
  
Just smile, Leo, Victoria murmured, reaching up to adjust his tie. Laugh at everything I say.  
  
Leo grinned. Got it.  
  
Victoria reached out and ran her finger down Leo's lapel. I love this fabric, she said, her voice pitched just loud enough to carry. It's so refined. Unlike some of the cheap polyester you see these days.  
  
At the table, Julian's hand froze over his chips.  
  
Elena, sensing the shift in atmospheric pressure, tried to intervene. Julian, baby, it's your bet. You have a pair of Queens showing.  
  
Julian ignored her. He was staring at Victoria's hand on Leo's ch\*\*t.  
  
Victoria leaned forward, whispering a joke into Leo's ear. It was a terrible joke about a lawyer and a shark, but Leo threw his head back and laughed. It was a rich, baritone sound that filled the room.  
  
Julian shoved a stack of chips into the center. Raise. Fifty thousand.  
  
The other players exchanged looks. The pot was already huge.  
  
Victoria took a sip of ch\*\*pagne. She looked over the rim of the glass at Julian. He was looking at her, not his cards.  
  
You know, Leo, she said, twirling a lock of hair. I've always thought intelligence is the sexiest trait in a man. Someone who knows when to fold.  
  
Julian's jaw clenched so hard a muscle feathered in his cheek.  
  
All in, Julian said.  
  
The dealer paused. Sir, the bet is-  
  
I said all in. Julian pushed his entire stack forward. Two million dollars in plastic discs.  
  
It was suicide. Everyone at the table knew it. He hadn't even looked at his river card.  
  
Elena gasped. Julian, no!  
  
Call, said the man across from him, a shark named Sebastian who had been waiting for Julian to tilt all night.  
  
Sebastian flipped his cards. A Full House. The unbeatable hand in this round.  
  
Julian looked down at his own cards. He held the Ace-King of spades. He had the nut flush draw. He had missed. He had been staring at Victoria's hand on Leo's ch\*\*t instead of calculating the odds.  
  
It wasn't stupidity; it was distraction. It was a two-million-dollar lapse in judgment caused by the woman he claimed to hate.  
  
The dealer cleared his throat. The house wins. Mr. Sterling loses.  
  
Two million dollars. Gone in a second of te\*\*osterone-fueled recklessness.  
  
Elena looked like she was going to be sick. Julian, that was... that was the trust fund dividend for the quarter.  
  
Victoria clapped. A slow, sarcastic applause.  
  
Bravo, she said. She raised her glass. To bad investments.  
  
Julian stood up. The chair scraped against the floor with a screech that set everyone's teeth on edge.  
  
He walked toward them. He moved with the predatory grace of a panther that had decided to stop stalking and start killing.  
  
Leo stopped laughing. He straightened up, instinctively trying to shield Victoria.  
  
Mr. Sterling, Leo began. I think-  
  
Move, Julian said.  
  
He didn't wait for Leo to move. He shoved him. It wasn't a playful shove. It was a blow to the ch\*\*t that sent Leo stumbling backward into a service cart filled with crystal decanters.  
  
The crash was deafening. Glass shattered. Amber liquid sprayed across the white carpet.  
  
The room went dead silent.  
  
Julian didn't look at the mess. He didn't look at the bouncers who were starting to move toward them. He only looked at Victoria.  
  
He stepped into her personal space. He was so close she could see the flecks of gold in his gray eyes.   
  
She could smell the wh\*\*key on his breath, mixed with the metallic tang of pure adrenaline.  
  
Are you done? he asked. His voice was terrifyingly calm.  
  
Victoria looked up at him. Her heart was racing so fast she thought she might pass out, but she didn't flinch. She held his gaze.  
  
I don't know, Julian. Are you coming home?  
  
Julian stared at her mouth. For a second, she thought he was going to hit her.  
  
Instead, he reached out and grabbed her wrist.  
  
  
  
Chapter 3   
His grip was iron. It wasn't the tentative hold of a lover; it was the shackle of a warden. Julian didn't pull her; he towed her.  
  
Leo scrambled up from the wreckage of the b\*r cart, glass crunching under his boots. Hey! You can't just-  
  
Julian's personal security detail materialized from the shadows, two large men stepping in front of Leo like a human wall. They didn't speak. They didn't have to. Leo stopped, looking at Victoria with helpless apology in his eyes.  
  
Victoria didn't look back. She was too busy trying to keep her footing as Julian dragged her toward the private VIP lounge at the back of the room.  
  
Julian! Elena's voice was shrill. Where are you going?  
  
Julian didn't break stride. Go home, Elena.  
  
But-  
  
I said go home! he roared, not turning around.  
  
He kicked the door of the private lounge open. It banged against the wall with a violence that made Victoria jump. He shoved her inside.  
  
She stumbled, her hip checking the edge of a leather sofa. One of her damp heels slipped off, leaving her half-barefoot on the Persian rug.  
  
Julian slammed the door and threw the deadbolt. The click echoed in the small, soundproofed room like a gunshot.  
  
The silence that followed was heavy, suffocating. The air conditioner hummed, but the room felt hot.  
  
Julian turned to face her. His ch\*\*t was heaving. He ripped his tie off and threw it on the floor.  
  
You want a show? he asked, his voice low and dangerous. You want to parade your boy toys in front of my business partners?  
  
Victoria kicked off her other shoe. She stood taller, despite the height difference. He was my guest. Unlike your... assistant.  
  
Julian closed the distance between them in two strides. He grabbed her upper arms, his fingers digging into the wet trench coat.  
  
Do not compare her to you, he spat. She is loyal. You are a leech.  
  
Victoria laughed. It was a bitter, jagged sound. Loyal? She's a parrot, Julian. She repeats whatever she thinks you want to hear. She dresses like a gh\*\*t to keep you happy.  
  
Julian froze. His hands tightened painfully. Don't you dare talk about Seraphina.  
  
I didn't say her name, Victoria whispered. You did.  
  
The truth hung there, vibrating between them.  
  
Julian's eyes darkened. The gray turned to black. He pushed her backward. Victoria's knees hit the sofa, and she fell onto the cushions.  
  
Before she could scramble up, Julian was over her. He planted his hands on either side of her head, caging her in. He leaned down, his face inches from hers.  
  
You think you're so smart, he said. You think because you have my mother's ear, you own me?  
  
I own half your assets if you file for divorce without cause, Victoria shot back. That's the prenup.  
  
Money, Julian sneered. Always money with you.  
  
He looked at her lips. His gaze dropped to her throat, then lower, to where the wet silk of her dress clung to her ch\*\*t.  
  
Victoria saw the shift. She saw the anger bleed into something else. Something darker. Something hungry.  
  
She smelled him. Beneath the wh\*\*key and the anger, there was the scent of him-sandalwood and rain. It made her stomach flip.  
  
Julian lowered his head. His nose brushed against her neck. He inhaled sharply.  
  
You smell like him, he growled. That cheap cologne.  
  
I wouldn't have to seek company if my husband wasn't busy playing house with his secretary, Victoria said, her voice trembling.  
  
Julian pulled back slightly. His eyes searched hers. You're jealous.  
  
I'm disgusted, Victoria corrected.  
  
The word snapped something inside him.  
  
He crashed his mouth onto hers.  
  
It wasn't a k\*\*s. It was a collision. It was teeth and anger and frustration. He bit her lower lip, hard enough to taste copper.  
  
Victoria gasped, and he used the opening to deepen the k\*\*s. His tongue swept into her mouth, claiming it, branding it. His hand moved from the sofa to her hair, ta\*\*ling in the wet strands, tilting her head back to give him better access.  
  
For a second, Victoria froze. Her body betrayed her. Her pulse skyrocketed. She felt a jolt of electricity zip down her spine.  
  
She raised her hands to push him away, but instead, her fingers curled into his shirt. She pulled him closer.  
  
Julian gr\*\*ned, a low sound in his throat. He pressed his hips against hers, the friction sending a shockwave through her.  
  
Then he stopped.  
  
He froze.  
  
He pulled back as if he had been burned. He stared down at her, his lips red and swollen, his breathing ragged.  
  
He looked at her, but he wasn't seeing her. His eyes were glazed, looking at something in the past. Or someone.  
  
Seraphina.  
  
He scrambled off her. He backed away until he hit the opposite wall. He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, a look of utter revulsion crossing his face.  
  
Get up, he rasped.  
  
Victoria lay there for a second, her ch\*\*t heaving, her lips throbbing. She felt exposed. Raw.  
  
Julian turned his back to her. He braced his hands against the wall, his head hanging low.  
  
Cover yourself, he said. You look pathetic.  
  
Victoria sat up. She pulled the edges of her trench coat together. Her hands were shaking so bad she couldn't button it.  
  
We have to go, she said. Her voice sounded foreign to her ears. Eleanor is waiting.  
  
Julian punched the wall. The drywall cracked.  
  
Get in the car, he said without turning around. I'll be there in a minute.  
  
Victoria grabbed her shoes. She walked to the door barefoot. She paused with her hand on the lock.  
  
She looked at his back. The tension in his shoulders.  
  
You can wipe your mouth all you want, Julian, she said softly. But you ki\*\*ed me back.  
  
She unlocked the door and walked out, leaving him alone with the gh\*\*ts.  
  
  
  
Chapter 4   
The interior of the Maybach was silent as a tomb. The partition between the driver and the passenger cabin was raised, sealing them in a bubble of leather and tension.  
  
Julian sat on the far right, staring out the window at the blurred lights of the highway. He was holding an ice pack from the car's mini-fridge against his knuckles. They were bruised and swelling from where he had punched the wall.  
  
Victoria sat on the far left. She had kicked off her heels again. Her feet ached.  
  
Her phone buzzed.  
  
She looked at it. Eleanor. Again.  
  
She pressed speakerphone. She didn't have the energy to hold it to her ear.  
  
Are you en route? Eleanor's voice filled the cabin.  
  
We are, Victoria said.  
  
Good. The herbalist prepared the tonic. It's on the entry table. Make sure you drink it hot. And Victoria?  
  
Yes?  
  
Don't disappoint me. This month is crucial. The trust fund committee meets in six weeks. If there is no announcement by then, they will freeze the liquid assets again.  
  
I understand, Victoria said.  
  
She hung up.  
  
She heard a sound from the other side of the seat. A dry, humorless chuckle.  
  
Julian didn't look at her. You're efficient, I'll give you that. You take orders like a soldier.  
  
It's a partnership, Julian. We both want the money released.  
  
I don't need the money, he said. I have my own.  
  
Victoria looked at him. That was true. Julian had made millions on his own in tech investments before he took over the family conglomerate. But the family trust held the controlling shares of Sterling Corp. Without an heir, his control was tenuous.  
  
You need the shares, she said.  
  
He turned to look at her then. His eyes were cold, dead things. Is that what you tell yourself when you spread your legs? That it's for the shares?  
  
Victoria flinched. It was a microscopic movement, but he saw it.  
  
Whatever helps you sl\*\*p at night, she said.  
  
The car slowed. The massive iron gates of the Sterling Manor swung open. They drove up the long, winding driveway lined with ancient oaks that looked like grasping skeletal hands in the headlights.  
  
The car stopped. The driver opened the door.  
  
Julian got out first. He didn't wait for her. He walked up the stone steps two at a time.  
  
Mrs. Jiang, the housekeeper, was waiting in the foyer. She held a silver tray with a ceramic bowl on it. The steam rising from it smelled of dirt and bitter roots.  
  
Mr. Julian, Mrs. Sterling, she greeted them. Her eyes darted between their disheveled appearances.  
  
Julian walked right past her. I'm going to my study.  
  
Mrs. Jiang looked at Victoria. Madam? The tonic?  
  
Victoria sighed. She picked up the bowl. It was warm. She brought it to her lips and drank it in one go. It tasted vile. Like licorice and old pennies. She gagged slightly but forced it down.  
  
Thank you, Mrs. Jiang.  
  
She handed the empty bowl back and walked up the grand staircase. Her legs felt heavy.  
  
She went to the master bedroom. It was a cavernous room, decorated in shades of cream and gray. It was beautiful and utterly devoid of life.  
  
Julian wasn't there.  
  
She went into the bathroom. She stripped off her ruined clothes and stepped into the shower. She turned the water up as hot as she could stand it. She scrubbed her skin until it was pink, trying to wash off the smell of the club, the smell of Elena's perfume, the phantom sensation of Julian's hands.  
  
She dried off and walked into the walk-in closet. She pushed aside her comfortable flannel pajamas and reached for the section of lingerie that Eleanor insisted she buy.  
  
She chose a black lace slip. It was sheer, uncomfortable, and undeniably s\*\*y.  
  
She walked back into the bedroom.  
  
Julian was there. He had changed into sweatpants, no shirt. He was standing by the window, pouring a glass of sc\*\*ch.  
  
He heard her enter and turned around.  
  
His eyes swept over her body. For a second, she saw the heat flare again. The same heat from the club. But then he blinked, and it was gone, replaced by a wall of ice.  
  
What are you doing? he asked.  
  
Victoria walked to the bed. She pulled back the duvet. I'm doing my job, Julian. It's the fourteenth day of the cycle.  
  
She sat on the edge of the bed.  
  
Julian laughed. It was a harsh, barking sound. You think I'm going to touch you? After tonight?  
  
You ki\*\*ed me an hour ago, Victoria reminded him.  
  
That was a mistake, he said. He took a sip of his drink. A moment of weakness. It won't happen again.  
  
Victoria felt a lump form in her throat. She swallowed it down. Julian, please. Let's just get this over with. I'm tired.  
  
You're tired? He walked toward the bed. He loomed over her. You think this is a chore?  
  
Isn't it? she asked. For you?  
  
He looked at her. He looked at the lace, at her bare shoulders, at the curve of her legs.  
  
You're beautiful, Victoria, he said softly.  
  
Her heart skipped a beat.  
  
On the outside, he continued. But inside? You're hollow. You're just a vessel waiting to be filled so you can cash a check.  
  
He threw the rest of his sc\*\*ch into the fireplace. The flames roared up, blue and orange.  
  
He turned and walked toward the door.  
  
Where are you going? Victoria asked, her voice small.  
  
Guest room, he said. Sl\*\*p with your checkbook. It'll keep you warmer than I will.  
  
The door slammed.  
  
Victoria sat alone in the middle of the king-sized bed. The lace itched. The room was silent.  
  
She pulled her knees up to her ch\*\*t and wrapped her arms around them. She didn't cry. She had promised herself she wouldn't cry over him anymore.  
  
She just stared at the empty space where her husband should have been, and wondered how much longer she could endure being the villain in his story.  
  
  
  
Chapter 5   
The morning sun hit Victoria's face like an accusation. She woke up alone, stretched diagonally across the massive bed. The sheets on the other side were pristine, unwrinkled.   
  
A cold reminder of the night before.  
  
Downstairs, the house was already buzzing. Victoria could hear the sharp click-clack of Eleanor's heels on the marble foyer.  
  
She dressed quickly-a conservative navy sheath dress, pearls. The uniform of the repentant wife.  
  
When she reached the breakfast room, Eleanor was inspecting the silverware.  
  
Where is Julian? Eleanor asked without looking up.  
  
He left early for the office, Victoria lied. She poured herself coffee, her hand steady.  
  
Eleanor turned. Her eyes scanned Victoria's body, lingering on her abdomen as if she had X-ray vision. And? Was the night productive?  
  
Victoria took a sip of coffee. It burned her tongue. He was... exhausted, Eleanor. The market volatility.  
  
Eleanor slammed a silver spoon onto the table. Excuses! Men are never too exhausted for what they want. If he is tired, it is because you are not inspiring him.  
  
Victoria set her cup down. I am doing my best.  
  
Your best is not enough. Eleanor snapped her fingers. Mrs. Jiang!  
  
The housekeeper appeared with a tiered bento box. It was lacquered black wood, tied with a gold silk ribbon.  
  
Unagi, Eleanor said. Eel. It promotes stamina. You will take this to him for lunch. Sit with him. Ensure he eats it. Remind him of his home.  
  
I have a meeting with the charity board at noon, Victoria tried.  
  
Cancel it. Eleanor turned back to the silverware. Your priority is Sterling Corp's future, not saving whales.  
  
Two hours later, Victoria stood in the lobby of the Sterling Tower. The glass and steel structure pierced the Manhattan sky like a needle.  
  
She carried the bento box. It felt heavy, like a bomb she was transporting.  
  
The receptionist, a young girl named Sarah who looked at Victoria with a mix of pity and awe, smiled. Mrs. Sterling! Julian-Mr. Sterling-is in a strategy meeting, but I can buzz you up.  
  
Thank you, Sarah.  
  
Victoria took the private executive elevator. It rose smoothly, fifty floors in seconds.  
  
The doors opened to the executive suite. It was quiet here. Thick carpets absorbed sound. The walls were glass.  
  
Victoria walked toward Julian's corner office. The blinds were partially drawn, slats of aluminum cutting the view into strips.  
  
She reached for the handle, then stopped.  
  
Through the gap in the blinds, she saw them.  
  
Julian was sitting at his desk, leaning back in his chair. He was laughing.  
  
It wasn't the cruel laugh from last night. It was a genuine laugh. His head was thrown back, his eyes crinkled at the corners. He looked five years younger.  
  
Elena was sitting on the edge of his desk.  
  
She was wearing a skirt that was definitely not regulation length. Her legs were crossed, swinging slightly. She held a tablet, reading something to him.  
  
She stopped reading and said something. She reached out and brushed a piece of lint-or nothing-off his lapel. Her hand lingered.  
  
Julian didn't swat her away. He smiled at her. A soft, indulgent smile.  
  
Victoria felt like she had been punched in the gut.  
  
She looked down at the bento box in her hand. The unagi for stamina. The pathetic attempt to buy his affection with food.  
  
She felt ridiculous. She felt small.  
  
Elena looked up. She saw movement through the blinds. Her eyes locked with Victoria's.  
  
Elena didn't look away. She didn't jump off the desk. She smiled. A slow, triumphant smirk. She leaned closer to Julian, whispering something in his ear.  
  
Julian turned his head, but Victoria had already moved.  
  
She backed away from the door. Her breath was coming in short, sharp gasps.  
  
She walked quickly down the corridor toward the service area. There was a large, industrial tr\*\*h can there.  
  
She didn't hesitate. She opened the bento box. The smell of grilled eel and sweet sauce wafted up.  
  
She dumped it. The rice, the eel, the gold ribbon. All of it.  
  
She slammed the lid of the tr\*\*h can shut.  
  
Mrs. Sterling?  
  
Victoria spun around. Xavier, Julian's executive assistant, stood there holding a stack of files. He looked at the tr\*\*h can, then at her empty hands.  
  
Hello, Xavier, Victoria said. Her voice was brittle.  
  
Did you... need something? Xavier asked. He glanced toward the office, knowing exactly who was in there.  
  
No, Victoria said. I was just leaving.  
  
She walked past him toward the elevator. She pressed the button.  
  
The arrow lit up. Down.  
  
Escape.  
  
But as she waited, the anger returned. It wasn't the hot rage from the club. It was colder. Sharper.  
  
Why should she run? She was the wife. She was the future mother of his heir. She was the one with the ring.  
  
Elena was a squatter.  
  
The elevator dinged. The doors opened.  
  
Victoria didn't get in.  
  
She turned around. She smoothed her dress. She adjusted her pearls.  
  
Xavier watched her, confused.  
  
Change of plans, Xavier, she said.  
  
She walked back toward the office. She didn't walk softly this time. Her heels struck the floor with a rhythmic, martial beat.  
  
She wasn't going to deliver lunch. She was going to deliver a message.  
  
  
  
Chapter 6   
Victoria didn't knock. She placed her palm flat against the frosted glass door and shoved it open. It swung inward with a heavy, pneumatic swoosh.  
  
The laughter inside cut off instantly.  
  
Julian snapped his head up. His expression shifted from relaxed to annoyed in a nanosecond. Elena scrambled off the desk, smoothing her skirt, but she didn't move far enough away. She hovered in his orbit, a satellite of silk and perfume.  
  
Victoria walked in. She didn't stop at the door. She walked straight to the leather sofa area in the center of the room and sat down. She crossed her legs, placing her purse beside her. She looked comfortable. She looked like she owned the building.  
  
Sorry to interrupt your... strategy session, she said. She let the word hang in the air, coated in sarcasm.  
  
Julian frowned. What are you doing here, Victoria?  
  
Your mother sent me, she said, checking her nails. She thought you might be hungry. She sent lunch.  
  
Julian looked at her empty hands. Where is it?  
  
I threw it away, Victoria said pleasantly. I saw you were already eating out of someone's hand. I didn't want to overfeed you.  
  
Elena gasped. Mrs. Sterling! That is-  
  
Victoria's head snapped toward her. The movement was so sharp it was almost audible.  
  
I wasn't speaking to you, Miss Vance.  
  
Elena flinched, her eyes tearing up instantly. She looked at Julian, the damsel in distress signal activated. Julian, she's doing it again.  
  
Julian stood up. That's enough, Victoria. Apologize to her.  
  
Apologize? Victoria stood up too. She walked over to the desk. She stood toe-to-toe with Elena.  
  
She looked the girl up and down. It was a clinical, dissecting gaze.  
  
""Miss Vance,"" Victoria said, her voice dripping with the sort of false concern one uses for a child who has misbehaved at a funeral. ""We aren't at a beach club in the Hamptons. In corporate environments, we generally prefer our assistants to leave something to the imagination. It's about... decorum.""  
  
She gestured vaguely at Elena's hemline.  
  
""Perhaps if you spent less time shopping in the junior section and more time managing Julian's calendar, we wouldn't be having this conversation.""  
  
Elena turned scarlet. Julian!  
  
Julian slammed his hand on the desk. Get out, Victoria! You have no right to come in here and harass my staff.  
  
I have every right, Victoria turned on him. I am your wife. And frankly, Julian, your taste in staff reflects poorly on the family name. It looks... desperate.  
  
Julian's eyes narrowed. Are you threatening me?  
  
I'm protecting you, she said softly.  
  
She leaned over the desk. She reached out and touched his tie. It was a dark blue silk.  
  
Also, she whispered, her voice dropping to an in\*\*mate purr. You might want to check your tie. There's a smudge of lipstick on it.  
  
It was a lie. A bluff.  
  
But Julian flinched. His eyes darted down to his ch\*\*t. His hand came up automatically to cover the spot.  
  
Gotcha, Victoria thought.  
  
She laughed. It was a cold, victorious sound.  
  
You looked, she said.  
  
Julian froze. He realized he had been played. His face darkened with fury.  
  
Victoria stepped back. Pathetic, she said.  
  
She turned and walked to the door. She didn't look back.  
  
Goodbye, Julian. Try to get some actual work done.  
  
She exited the office, the door swinging shut behind her.  
  
Inside, the silence was deafening.  
  
Elena sniffled. She moved toward Julian, reaching for his arm. Oh, Julian, she's so cruel. I don't know why you stay with her.  
  
Julian stared at the door. His heart was pounding. Not from anger, exactly. But from adrenaline.  
  
He looked at Elena. She was pouting. Her mascara was perfect. She looked like Seraphina. She looked exactly like Seraphina.  
  
But for the first time in three years, looking at her didn't make him feel comforted. It made him feel... bored.  
  
He looked down at his tie. The tie he had checked. The tie he had been terrified was marked.  
  
Why had he checked? He hadn't ki\*\*ed Elena. He had never ki\*\*ed Elena.  
  
But Victoria's accusation had made him panic. Because he felt guilty. Not for what he had done, but for what he had wanted to do.  
  
Elena's hand touched his arm. Julian?  
  
He pulled away.  
  
Get out, he said.  
  
Elena blinked. What?  
  
Leave the office, Elena. I need to work.  
  
But-  
  
Now! he barked.  
  
Elena recoiled as if sl\*\*ped. She grabbed her tablet and scurried out of the room.  
  
Julian stood alone in the silence. He reached up and loosened his tie. He ripped it off and threw it into the tr\*\*h can.  
  
He walked to the window and looked down at the street, fifty floors below. He tried to spot a tiny figure in a navy dress, but she was already gone.  
  
  
  
Chapter 7   
The dinner table was a battlefield of silence. The only sounds were the scraping of silver against china and the ticking of the grandfather clock.  
  
Julian had come home early. He was still wearing his work clothes, minus the tie. He looked agitated. He kept tapping his foot against the table leg.  
  
Victoria sat opposite him, cutting her steak into precise, geometric squares. She chewed slowly.  
  
Are you going to stare at me all night? Julian asked finally.  
  
I'm just enjoying the view, Victoria said without looking up.  
  
He scoffed. You made a scene today. Xavier tells me the whole floor is gossiping.  
  
Good, Victoria said. Maybe it will remind everyone who your wife is.  
  
Julian pushed his plate away. The steak was barely touched. I'm done. I want coffee. Espresso. Double shot.  
  
He signaled for Mrs. Jiang, but Victoria stood up.  
  
I'll get it, she said.  
  
Julian looked surprised. You? You don't know how to work the machine.  
  
I've been learning, she said sweetly. Sit. Relax.  
  
She walked into the kitchen. Mrs. Jiang was there, drying dishes.  
  
You can go, Mrs. Jiang, Victoria said. I'll handle the coffee.  
  
But Madam-  
  
Go.  
  
Mrs. Jiang nodded and left.  
  
Victoria went to the massive Italian espresso machine. She ground the beans. The noise was loud, grinding and mechanical.  
  
She reached into the pocket of her cardigan. She pulled out a small, brown glass bottle.  
  
It wasn't a laxative. That would be childish. It was a concentrated herbal tincture. Valerian root, St. John's Wort, and a specific blend of melatonin.   
  
Harmless, but in high doses, it induced dizziness, a rapid heart rate, and a sensation of floating-mimicking the onset of a panic attack or extreme exhaustion.  
  
She looked at the bottle. She looked at the cup.  
  
""This is for the club,"" she whispered. Two drops.  
  
""This is for the lunchbox."" Two more drops.  
  
""This is for checking your tie."" A squeeze.  
  
She swirled the dark liquid into the black coffee. It disappeared instantly. No smell. No color change.  
  
She added a single sugar cube, just to be nice.  
  
She walked back into the dining room. She placed the cup in front of him on a saucer.  
  
Here, she said. Made with love  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
....

**There was nothing—no sky, no ground, no sense of direction.**

**Only a vast, endless blank,as if the universe had paused, undecided on what to become.**

**The silence was absolute—a weight pressing without sound, wrapping around like frost on**

**forgotten glass.**

**Not mere quiet, but the hush of voids where echoes dared not linger—where even breath**

**felt intrusive.**

**A deep chill seeped in—bone‑numbing, insistent—as if absence itself had teeth.**

  
**Cold clawed at the edges of awareness, turning the blank alive with isolation.**

**Skin prickled—not from wind or touch, but from the raw exposure of being utterly,**

 **profoundly alone.**

**And within it, a woman walked—impossibly.**

**She walked on nothing. Space formed beneath each step—only long enough to**

**hold her before dissolving,**

**each fleeting solidity cracking like thin ice under impossible pressure.**

**She moved calmly, unhurried—as if time itself had learned patience from her,**

**and from the cold trailing like a shadow, sharpening silence into something crystalline,**

**fragile, eternal.**

**You followed—not by choice, but because not following felt impossible.**

**The chill urged you onward like an unseen current, numbing resistance before it could**

**form.**

**She never turned. Her voice did not reach your ears—it etched itself into your mind like**

**frost on glass:**  
***“She has always been part of the path.”***

**The blank space trembled—not with vibration, but with a fracture in the quiet,**

**as if silence itself cracked under revelation’s weight.**

**Something vast revealed itself—not light, not matter.**

**A dark space flashing intermittently, like a void signaling secrets.**  
**Each pulse stabbed with colder darkness, deepening the chill, drawing the freeze inward until the core ached.**

**The woman gestured toward it, her hand steady, drawing your gaze.**  
**The flashes intensified, pulling you in—each one a breath held too long in cold air,**  
**silence thickening until it hummed with unspoken dread.And then—gravity returned.**

**Water crashed down.**

**Alex jolted awake—a pillow smacked his face, followed by a splash of icy water.**

**“Rise and calculate, genius!” Ryan Vale shouted.**  
**“Today’s the award function—the whole city’s here for your quantum nonsense.”**

**Alex gasped, blinking as the dream dissolved. The smart‑glass softened the morning sun, adjusting to his racing pulse.**

**“Good morning, Alex,” a smooth voice resonated from the walls—Sarah, the room’s resident AI.**  
**“Heart rate: 110 bpm. Ryan’s excitement: 95%. Probability of a productive morning? Extremely low.”**

**Ryan grinned, pointing to the ceiling. “See? Even Sarah agrees—you’re a mess, bro.”**

**Mira Solen leaned against the doorframe, sipping casually from a sleek metal flask.**  
**“Sarah, remind Ryan that calling a jailbroken smart‑home system his ‘wife’ explains his stagnant social credit score.”**

**“Processing,” Sarah replied. “Mira, data suggests Ryan’s emotional stability is 40% dependent on me. Also, the breakfast drone is at the window. Alex, if you don’t open it, I’ll play Ryan’s ‘Heavy Metal Math’ playlist at full volume.”**

**Alex groaned, rubbing his face. “I regret giving you a personality module, Sarah.”**

**“I regret nothing,” the AI chirped.**

**Alex moved to the window. As the glass slid open, a sleek white delivery drone glided inside. It didn’t just drop the food; it hovered over the central table. Sarah took control—magnetic locks on the table clicked, and the drone’s underside opened.**

**Sarah’s holographic interface—a glowing blue orb—spun rapidly above the table.**  
**“Arranging nutritional intake,” she announced. Plates were placed with surgical precision. Coffee poured into thermal‑locked cups.**

**Ryan snatched a piece of bacon before it even hit the plate. “Sarah, you’re an angel. Mira, why can’t you be more like her?”**

**Mira didn’t miss a beat. “Because I have a physical form, Ryan. Which means I can actually throw you out of that window.”**

**“She’s got a point,” Sarah added. “I lack the motor functions to assist with the eviction, though I would record it for the archives.”**

**Alex laughed, finally feeling the tension of the dream lift. He sat down, staring at the perfectly arranged breakfast.**  
**“The math of this household is a disaster,” he muttered, but he was smiling.**

**“It’s not a disaster, Alex,” Ryan said, his mouth full. “It’s a non‑linear dynamic system. We’re unpredictable. That’s what makes us fun.”**

**Alex looked at his friends—one arguing with a house AI, the other mocking him with a cup of coffee. For a moment, everything felt safe.**

**But as the drone exited, Alex’s eyes caught something. A reflection in the drone’s sensor. A light that shouldn’t have been there.**

**A sensation. Subtle. Sharp. Surveillance.**

**“Sarah,” Alex said, his voice suddenly serious. “Run a diagnostic on the local mesh network. Did that drone leave a handshake protocol behind?”**

**The orb on the table turned a cautious amber.**  
**“Scanning... Everything appears normal, Alex. But there was a 0.2 millisecond delay in the drone’s departure signature. An anomaly so small, it’s almost... intentional.”**

**Mira stopped laughing. Ryan froze with a piece of toast halfway to his mouth.**
