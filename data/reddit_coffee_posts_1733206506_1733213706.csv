1h5ii35,https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/1h5ii35/check_out_our_faq_basic_information_about_kdrama/,"Check Out Our FAQ: Basic Information About Kdrama Production and Broadcast - December, 2024","Welcome to our series of posts highlighting information and resources available within our subreddit. In this post, we introduce our [FAQ](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/kdramas_101) and our [KDRAMA 101](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/generalresources), which contains some of the most commonly asked questions and other basic information about kdramas. This post will focus on a selection of questions about kdrama production and broadcast process, check out our FAQ for even more information.

If you have any additional questions about the information in this post or our FAQ, feel free to leave a comment with your question/feedback.

**Why Do Kdramas Have Different English Titles?**

English titles of dramas can be one of the following types:

>* **Official English Title:** an official English title determined by the production company/broadcast station
>
>* **Literal Translation:** a literal translation of the official Korean title (most often the official English title) 
>
>* **Alternate Translation:** an alternate translation of the official Korean title
>
>* **Alternate Title Translation:** a translation of an alternate Korean title (sometimes the initial working title)
>
>* **Alternate Title Specific to Stream Source:** certain streaming sites have alternate titles for dramas

We advise checking the drama title on a resource such as [MyDramaList](https://mydramalist.com/) for alternate titles. 

**How Many Episodes And How Long Is Each Episode?**

Most kdramas are between 12 to 52 episodes long with each episode being around 1 hour long. **Notable exception:** tvN shows have a tendency for 1hr+ episodes, especially for the newer shows. (Background: This trend was started with Reply 1997 which started with breezy ~35 min long episodes but as the drama snowballed in popularity, its episode lengths kept expanding until its final episodes were 1hr+.)

**What's With The 16 vs 32 Episodes?**

Due to laws regarding advertising, some broadcasters have split up their drama episodes into two halves so every two ~30-minute episode would comprise the traditional 1-hour long episode. Thus what would be the typical 16 episodes are now 32 episodes.

**What Types Of Kdramas Are There?**

Korean dramas can be categorized into 4 categories based on their form/length:

>* **Daily Dramas** (30 min episodes, usually 100+ episodes in length)
>
>* **Miniseries** (mid-length dramas, 12-20 hours long)
>
>* **Serial/Family/Weekend Dramas** (long-form dramas)
>
>* **Web Dramas**

[*See More Details*](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/generalresources#wiki_what_are_korean_dramas.3F)

**What's The Difference Between Pre-Produced and Live-Production?**

Kdramas are generally produced by production companies in conjunction with the production arm of the broadcasting station. Kdramas are generally live-produced, meaning that the drama is being filmed as it is airing.

>**Pre-Produced:** Where the drama has completely finished filming and all after production work prior to its airing. Most kdramas broadcast on the broadcasting channels (free to air and cable channels) are ***not*** pre-produced though there are exceptions. In contrast, most kdramas produced for the streaming platforms (Wavve, TVING, Netflix) are pre-produced.
>
>**Live-Production:** Most kdramas are filmed as they are broadcast. While all kdramas began filming before its premiere date, most dramas are still filming during its broadcast run, with some dramas still filming in the hours before its finale broadcast. This means that screenwriters may be writing or adjusting the script depending on viewer feedback. 

**Do Kdramas Have Teams of Screenwriters?**

Generally only the head screenwriter(s) is credited for a drama but most screenwriters have assistants. Kdramas do not have screenwriter teams common to western/American shows because kdramas are generally not multi-season continuations that go on for years and years.

**What Are Korea's Major Broadcast Channels?**

>**Free-to-air**: KBS (public broadcaster), SBS, MBC
>
>**Cable**: tvN, OCN, JTBC, TV Chosun, MBN, Channel A

[*See More Details*](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/generalresources#wiki_korean_broadcast_stations)

**What Is A Typical Drama Promotional Cycle?**

A drama's promotional cycle typically starts with the announcement of the project, which is often accompanied by initial casting news. Next, the initial script reading takes place and pictures are often released from this event to drum up interest in the drama. Once the filming begins, pictures taken during filming and coffee truck pictures are often shared. Usually shortly following the start of filming, official promotional material is releases, which includes drama poster(s), character posters, and teasers.

Before broadcast starts, there is generally an official press conference where the director (PD), the main cast members, and sometimes the writer will meet with the press to talk about the drama.

Before premiere or during broadcast (and sometimes after broadcast has finished), the cast members (together or individually) may appear on various variety shows to promote the drama.

[*See More Details*](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/generalresources#wiki_promotional_cycle_of_a_kdrama)

**What Is PPL? (Product Placement)**

PPL stands for ""Product Placement"", which is a form of embedded advertising -- an advertising technique used by companies to subtly promote their products through a non-traditional advertising technique, usually through appearances in film, television, or other media. In short, everything worn, eaten, or used in dramas may be advertising something. Oftentimes, the dialogue will make it clear that something is PPL and is being advertised by lauding the advantages of the PPL product. 

> Why Do All Characters Have Same Car/Phone/Vacuum/Clothes? **PPL**
>
> Why Do They All Eat At Subway/Quiznos/BBQ Chicken/That One Coffee Shop? **PPL**
>
> Is PPL Possible In Historical Kdramas AKA Sageuks? Yes, it's possible. See [this post](/r/KDRAMA/comments/ho8z5i/a_question_about_product_placement_in_historical/) for insight and examples.

**What Are OSTs?**

OST stands for **Original Soundtrack**. All kdramas have their own original soundtracks (OSTs) -- songs specifically created for the kdrama. How many songs there are depends on the kind of drama it is. Generally, most dramas will have one or two theme songs that get used frequently. OST tracks are generally released as the drama broadcasts, they are **not** released all at once upon the premiere of a drama. Check our [Drama Resources](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/dramaresources) for where to find more information on OST releases.

Some dramas also use previously existing songs -- these generally are not included in the OST, though new original covers of old songs specifically made for the kdrama generally are included as part of the OST.

Sometimes the background music of the kdrama available on a legal streaming site will differ from the version broadcast on Korean television due to copyright and licensing issues. [Here](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/kdramas_101/netflix_faqs#wiki_what.27s_with_the_music.3F) is a slightly more in depth explanation of why music is changed.

**Why Are Things Blurred?**

Oftentimes there will be things blurred in a kdrama. Blurring usually happens due to broadcasting regulations either due to copyright issues or the manner of the content being shown. 

If no one is being harmed or killed, the blurring is likely due to copyright issues -- whatever is being shown does not have the right licenses to be shown/streamed everywhere so they are blurred out. This is done by post-production. Another form of blurring you may see is that brands and logos are blacked out by tape or otherwise covered within dramas so that they are not shown. These are generally done during filming and not via post-production.

If someone is being harmed or killed: broadcasting rules require blurring of weapons and other tools being used in a manner intended to hurt someone. This means that while a kitchen knife used for chopping vegetable is not blurred, if later that same knife is used for stabbing someone, it will be blurred. Note that these broadcasting rules apply only to kdramas broadcast on the broadcasting stations (free to air or cable ones). This means that movies will not be blurred. Additionally, kdramas available exclusively on streaming services (Wavve, TVING, Netflix, Viki, etc.) are also **not** subject to these regulations and do not have to be blurred.  

**Where Is This Filming Location?**

To find information about a filming location, try [Korean Dramaland](https://koreandramaland.com/). You can search by a specific drama (to see the locations used in that drama) or by a location (to see all the dramas that have filmed there). They also include overseas locations. They are a still growing site and constantly adding new locations, you can contribute to it too to help it grow!

**Is That A Cameo Or Something More?**

The concept of cameos is very well established in kdrama-land. Actors will often make special appearances (cameos) for directors, writers, and actors they've worked with in the past in their newest works. Friends within the industry will often do this too.

When the story fits, they may cameo as a previous character. Other times, they will cameo as a completely new character, it really just depends on the situation. There's no need to force two stories together/make up theories, just treat them as ***cameos***.

**Is There A Season 2?**

In general Korean dramas are not multi-season, so do not expect a second season unless:

* It was announced at the start that the drama was envisioned as multiple seasons (think Netflix productions like Kingdom, Arthdal Chronicles, etc.)

***or***

* It was a very popular procedural (crime, forensics, legal). For example: Voice, Partners For Justice, Vampire Prosecutor, God’s Quiz, etc..

Posts asking about subsequent seasons of aired dramas are prohibited. All speculations about subsequent seasons of aired dramas should be made in one of our [FFA threads](/r/KDRAMA/?f=flair_name%3A%22FFA%20Thread%22).

**Where Is The Sex?/Why So Chaste?**

Different culture and broadcasting regulations. ***But also:***

Ever notice a scene where the leads are either in bed or heading towards the bedroom or hugging and then the scene cuts to black or cuts off and all of a sudden the next scene seems to have been sometime after or in the morning?

That's the kdrama way of ***hinting*** that the viewer should be using their imagination right then.

Also, anytime you hear a joke or talk about how strong a male lead's back and/or waist is, the *implication* is how good he will be in bed.

There are a lot of hints in most dramas that involve a relationship, it's just that kdramas are family friendly so they are not visually explicit. You can watch the same drama as your grandparents and your younger siblings but only those in the know will *nod* and *snicker* at the right times.

So if you see something that you think implies a couple having sex, you are probably picking up the right cues. The visually explicit stuff is saved for their movies.",0,1733212830.0,KDRAMA,0,0.5,False

1h5ifi1,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1h5ifi1/eyeless_jack/,Eyeless Jack,"Hello, my name is Mitch. I’m here to tell you guys about an experience I had. I don’t know if it was paranormal or whatever stupid words people use to describe supernatural phenomena, but after that thing visited me, I believe in that paranormal trash, now.

A week after I moved in with my brother, Edwin, after my house was foreclosed, I finished unpacking. Edwin liked the idea of me moving in, since we had not seen each other for 10 years, so I was excited, too. I soon fell asleep after I moved in. After that first week, I heard rustling noises coming from outside at about one in the morning. I thought it was a raccoon, so I ignored it and tried to fall asleep. The next morning, I told Edwin about it, and he agreed.

The next night, however, I thought I heard my window opening and a loud thump, as if something entered my room. I darted up and looked around my room, but I saw nothing. The next morning, Edwin dropped his coffee cup when he saw me. He held up a nearby mirror and I saw myself. I had a large gash in my left cheek.

After I was rushed to the hospital, my doctor told me that I must have been sleepwalking, but then he showed me something that made my blood turn cold. He lifted up my shirt to reveal a sewn up incision where my kidneys were. I stared into his eyes, mine widening. “You somehow lost your left kidney last night,” my doctor told me. “We don’t know how, though. Sorry, Mitch.”


The next night was my breaking point. Around midnight, I woke up to see a truly horrifying sight. I was staring face to face with a creature with a black hoodie and dark blue mask with no nose or mouth staring down at me. The thing that scared me the most was that it had no eyes. Just empty, black sockets. The creature also had some black substance dripping from its sockets. I grabbed a camera from the nearby mantel and took a picture.

Immediately after taking the shot, the creature lunged at me and tried to claw open my chest to get to my lungs. I stopped it by kicking it in the face. As I ran out of my room, I grabbed my wallet. I would need the money. I ran out of my brother’s house into the night. I eventually ended up in the woods near Edwin’s house and tripped on a rock.

I fell unconscious and woke up in the hospital. My doctor – the same one who treated me before – entered the room. “I have good news and bad news, Mitch,” my doctor started. “The good news is that you had minor injuries, and your parents are going to pick you up.” I sighed with relief. “The bad news is that your brother has been killed by some… thing. Sorry.”

My parents took me back to Edwin’s house to collect my remaining belongings, which I did. Upon entering my room, I was scared, but remained calm. I grabbed my camera and then stopped dead in my tracks. In the hallway leading to my room, I saw Edwin’s body and something small lying next to it. I retrieved it up and entered my parent’s car, not mentioning Edwin’s corpse. I looked at the thing I had picked up and nearly vomited. I was holding my stolen half-eaten kidney, with some black substance on it.",2,1733212498.0,creepypasta,1,1.0,False
1h5ierj,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductivityPals/comments/1h5ierj/how_to_develop_better_habits/,How To Develop Better Habits?,"Hey everyone! I want to share something that completely transformed my life - my journey with habit development. I know it sounds like another one of those self-help posts, but stick with me here. I've been through the whole cycle of trying and failing to build better habits, and I finally cracked the code.

First things first, let's get real about habits. They're not just things we do - they're literally who we become. Every morning, when I struggled to get out of bed or procrastinated on important work, I realized I wasn't just making random choices - I was reinforcing patterns.

Here's what actually works (and I'm speaking from experience):

1. Start ridiculously small
I mean tiny. Want to read more? Start with one page a day. Exercise? Begin with one push-up. It sounds silly, but this approach has science backing it up. When I began my fitness journey, I started with a 5-minute walk. Now I run 5k three times a week.

2. Stack your habits
Attach new habits to existing ones. I linked my meditation practice to my morning coffee routine. Now I can't imagine having my coffee without those 5 minutes of mindfulness.

3. Make it obvious
Place your workout clothes next to your bed if you want to exercise in the morning. Put that book you want to read on your pillow. I keep my journal on my nightstand, making it impossible to ignore.

4. Track your progress
This is crucial. I noticed a massive improvement when I started tracking my habits. Actually, I created a free Daily Habit Tracker spreadsheet that has helped thousands of people (including myself) stay consistent. You can grab yours at https://theexcellenceeffect.com/ - it's completely free and might be exactly what you need to stay accountable.

5. Celebrate small wins
Did you drink water instead of soda? That's a win. Read for 5 minutes? Victory! These celebrations wire your brain to crave these good habits.

6. Environment design
Your environment shapes your behavior more than willpower. I removed social media apps from my phone's home screen and suddenly found myself reading more.

7. The 2-day rule
Never skip your habit two days in a row. This has been a game-changer for me. One day off is fine, two creates a pattern.

Look, building better habits isn't about massive changes or superhuman discipline. It's about small, consistent actions that compound over time. I've seen this work not just for me, but for hundreds of others I've helped through my weekly newsletter.

Remember, you don't rise to the level of your goals - you fall to the level of your systems. Create solid systems, and the results will follow.

What habit are you working on right now? Drop a comment below - I'd love to help out with specific strategies!

PS: If you found this helpful, I dive deeper into these concepts and share practical strategies in my weekly newsletter. Plus, you'll get access to that habit tracker I mentioned. Let's grow together!",1,1733212406.0,ProductivityPals,0,1.0,False

1h5i4mo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1h5i4mo/should_i_end_this_friendship_or_try_to_improve_it/,"Should I end this friendship, or try to improve it?","Context: both women in our late twenties. We’ve been close friends (she was in my wedding) for 5 years. Met in our early twenties, when I befriended both her and her (now ex) partner on the same night at a party. My partner and I double dated with them for a few years. She has really been there for me during some difficult times and is always very thoughtful and caring.

The first warning to me was 2 years ago, after she and her partner broke up, when she offered to help my partner and I move. she suddenly got very upset in the middle of our moving day and went outside. I then spent a while talking to her while my partner and my other friend continued moving our furniture (which I felt bad about). Apparently she was upset that I’d told her we still had occasional contact with her ex (the 4 of us had all been friends for a few years and he had asked us to get coffee with him after the breakup). I told her I wouldn’t continue the contact with the ex since it bothered her. She said we were good but then immediately left. She also made a comment about how after what I went through she thought I’d be more  supportive, which bothered me. She was referring to my history as an abuse survivor, when to my knowledge her partner had never been abusive. It felt inappropriate to tell me how I was supposed to act based on my trauma. I kind of regret sharing that with her now. And it felt very odd to be having that convo in the middle of our moving day.

Part of me was a little paranoid that she chose to do this on moving day because my partner and I had just purchased our first home, which was an exciting day for us. It felt like weird timing.

It sometimes feels like when there are exciting moments in my life this friend unknowingly makes it about her. At my bachelorette party, she got upset and left early, after what felt like a lot of me having to take care of her at the cost of me spending time with other friends who had traveled to be there (she lives close by). And the next day she kept texting me so I had to reassure her while trying to be present for the rest of the party.

Or when I texted our friend group that I got into a masters program in another state, she called me crying and said I was abandoning her. Honestly there are a number of examples like that.

It’s at the point where if I invite her to something in a group I need to plan very thoughtfully how to make her feel comfortable and I can’t relax. But if I don’t invite her she feels left out. I’m doing a study abroad soon and she wants to come visit me, and I’m already anxious that I’ll need to take care of her on that trip.

There was recently a weekend trip for our friend group where she had some drama with another close friend. She felt very threatened by my closeness with the person she had the conflict with, and interpreted me hanging out when them while they were fighting as me hiding that her (when in my view I didn’t need to ask her permission first). We talked about it later and she owned that I had the right to see this person, but getting to that point felt exhausting and really ruined the weekend for me.

When we got home she texted me to hang out and I didn’t respond for about a week because I felt frustrated and needed space. She then started reaching out to other people asking if I was ok since I didn’t respond, which felt pushy to me. She told me that me not texting her back was very triggering for her and brought up anxious attachment, etc. I get anxiety now anytime I see a text from her bc I don’t want to trigger her by not responding quickly.

Due to all of this (and some more incidents that im not including here), I started thinking we could transition to a more surface level friendship where we only hang in a group, but she kept reaching out to me, and I felt she deserved an explanation.

Eventually I tried to (gently) have a sit down conversation about it. I said I felt very anxious about our friendship and a little pressured to accommodate her needs during a time when I was navigating my own challenges and had less bandwidth. I gave a few examples.

She said she doesn’t expect me to take care of her feelings, but I don’t think she’s aware that her actions kinda put me in that position a lot. And even when she later acknowledges that she was inappropriate and apologizes (which she does), it’s really stressful to me to get to that point. I don’t have this stress with any other friend.

She felt really bad, and then I felt bad. She started crying and crying. She kept saying she wasn’t crying on purpose and was having really bad PMS, and I believe her. But even so — me gently expressing my issues was so upsetting for her that the convo about my needs kinda devolved into me consoling her.

I understand that she has very real abandonment trauma and insecurity and neurodivergence and I want to be understanding. But where is the line on me accommodating her (valid) mental health issues if it’s stopping me from being present with other friends? I want to be inclusive. But I also have trauma, some of which involves abuse/being scared of upsetting someone volatile. So this dynamic doesn’t feel good to me anymore.

But she has been there for me and supported me during some really big moments in my life. I genuinely don’t think she’s a bad person, and we have some amazing memories together, but I think she’s a little unaware or emotionally immature and we may have really different needs.

What do I do? Do I end the friendship with honesty? Is it even safe to do that? Do I try again to fade it to surface level and when she tries to hang I just white lie and keep saying I’m busy? Do I have other conversations with her about how to improve the friendship, and try to implement really strong boundaries when she is triggered? Or do I just accept that she needs more special accommodations than my other friends do and plan to better meet her needs? Please advise.",1,1733211158.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

They were on that parasocial shit from day one.

Fun MBMBAM history tidbit: Very early on, the theme song was Take a Chance on Me by ABBA. Looks like (It's A) Departure didn't come in until episode 38, which is later than I thought it was. I kind of thought that was in by episode 10.

Justin is the first brother to speak on the first episode, reasonable as he is the oldest and thus the most powerful.

Griffin immediately giggles at ""titular"" in ""titular brothers"", reasonable as he is the youngest and thus the most whimsical.

I always feel like there's a specific difference between ""titular"" and ""eponymous"", but I don't think there is. Titular has a definition that includes ""of, relating to, or constituting a title"" (""the titular hero of the play"") whereas ""eponymous"" refers to what a thing is named after. I think both would actually be correct in this case.

Justin misspeaks and says they take your questions ""every day"" rather than ""every week"", encouraging Griffin to riff on it saying ""every second, it's in real time"", both of them pretending the podcast is a call-in show, encouraging listeners to call in ""now. Now. Now."" It sounds a lot more menacing in text in a way I don't think I can fix.

oh my god there's a HEAVY breath sound on Justin's mic, like he's breathing right into that thing when he speaks and I don't appreciate it.

It's time for a bit where they begin showing off the original titles they were ""workshopping"", as the original title of My Brother My Brother and Me was ""too long"", which is insane to me to think about because that name already makes me tired to say.

I was going to list all of the ""original titles"" they suggest but they riff for a while on ""Kenan and Kel and Justin and Travis and Griffin"" so I guess I'm sticking on that one for now.

As Griffin makes a joke about not wanting to lose all his orange soda were Kel on the podcast, Travis references the ""who loves orange soda"" bit, reasonable as he is the middlest and thus the most Travis.

""Does drinking orange soda have racial connotations...?"" -Justin McElroy, 2010.

The last time Griffin ever saw Kel Mitchell (which is worded like the man has died) was on a movie in Blockbuster in 1998 called Who Made The Potato Salad?. I looked this up to find out that:

1. It is apparently spelled Potatoe. 
2. This movie came out in 2006. 
3. Kel Mitchell is not in it. 

So unless Griffin saw an entirely different yet similarly named movie, I think we are being lied to, as an audience.

I guess that's the end of the ""here are our original titles for MBMBAM"" bit because we're going into a question, so segued because it was sent by ""the\_potato"" on Twitter. I guess the idea of naming their podcast after an unrelated Nickelodeon show was just too funny.

Just want to shout out Kel Mitchell here, a lot of people might know this but it's worth bringing up, that dude is a pastor now. He was last in a movie in 2013 until 2023's Good Burger 2 (a movie I still need to watch), but he's been getting TV roles here and there consistently. He's also been releasing some musical singles in recent years. Kel seems to be doing pretty well for himself, and as a huge fan of the show Kenan and Kel, I'm always glad to hear he and Kenan are both doing well. Did you know Kenan has an active podcast?

Anyway, the first ever question on MBMBAM is how to clout chase. *""I want a larger follower count, but I'm finding it difficult to get more than two in a day. What can I do?""*

>Griffin: Start a bunch of accounts and have them follow each other.

I think that's a real thing people do.

Griffin comes up with the idea of buying followers, a scam business that I'm pretty sure does exist.

They suggest the idea that even two followers a day is good because those followers will retweet your funny stuff, and exponentially that will get you more followers. They describe that those two followers a day will become four and then they'll continue to increase. This is a pyramid scheme.

Apparently all you need to do to be popular is to get sponsors.

>Griffin: That's how you get Beib'd.

>Justin: That's how Beiber did it.

>Travis: I don't know who Justin Beiber is.

Travis seen here perfecting his ""The conversation isn't about me but I must find a way to turn it to me"" style.

Griffin was apparently on an ironic Twilight kick but claims his love for Beiber is genuine.

There's some more Beiber bit-making about him being on Saturday Night Live and being up past his bedtime. It's acceptable comedy, I guess.

Our first ever Yahoo! *""What is the chord progression during the intro of the ABC series Greek?""*

Man these landmark questions are kinda dogwater, huh. It sure makes the other two laugh themselves silly, tho.

Apparently the question asker capitalized Chord Progression and Intro, and put 'Greek' in single apostrophes, which Griffin thinks is remarkable.

The bit here is that the brothers are baffled as to why someone would be interested in what the chord progression for a song is.

There's a bit where Justin theorizes that the username is their actual name, and remarks on the idea of the Arby's manager (I guess in this joke the person works at Arby's) saying ""\[Name\], make all these fries!"". Travis adds on ""\[Name\], why don't you have a girlfriend?"", which I think would be a very invasive question for a manager at a fast food place to ask me.

I'm only not putting the name in the bit because I'm hearing it and can't spell the way it sounds. It sounds like ""Resuwin"" but I have to be wrong on that and I'd be embarrassed if I was. So don't go look up a 15 year old Yahoo question and tell me I'm wrong. I'll be embarrassed.

Oh, there's more to the question. I forgot sometimes they get distracted. *""Is it from a song? I'm not talking about the Plain White T's song, I'm talking about the short five-second chord progression that plays in the intro to Greek in the current season.""* This is season 5, according to Griffin.

I zoned out and came back to Griffin elaborating that it's ABC Family's Greek, not just ABC. I assume this is important. Jerkers I assure you this is just minutes of them wondering why someone would care about the chord progression for a sitcom theme. I saw a new board game and got more interested in looking up what it was about.

The bit ends. They do not have an answer. I tried to look up the opening to Greek. I couldn't find it. Wikipedia tells me the show Greek only had four seasons. I'm getting really tired of Griffin McElroy and his endless deception.

Spambot wants to know *""How do I get my incredibly talented artist friends to draw more?""*

You cannot. It's like trying to make a mythical animal perform a trick. You can only ask and hope your pleas are heard.

Or you can pay them.

>Griffin: If your incredibly talented artist friends don't draw that frequently, then they're either not incredibly talented or they're not artists.

Okay. Those are words you can say.

>Travis: Or they're not your friends!

As you can see, Travis noticed an unused word in that statement and immediately asked ""is anyone gonna eat that?"".

>Griffin: Maybe they're doing all this secret drawing!

>Travis: That's for their real friends!

Griffin mentions a school that sounds like Rizzdy and with my 2024 brain I hear ""Rizz D"" and feel like people would go nuts for this.

WAIT THERE'S A TRANSCRIPT

Okay the movie is also spelled ""Potato"" in the transcript, apparently the Yahoo user was called Resuin AND GRIFFIN SPELLED IT OUT, HOW DID I MISS THAT, and apparently it's an acronym; RISD is a college in Rhode Island for art and design. This recap will now be significantly more informed than before and I won't have to worry about MaxFun's terrible audio player, which cannot go back just a little bit using the arrow keys, you just have to click on the wave form and hope it's the right spot.

>Travis: My advice is this most likely know better than you know how good they actually are. You're looking at it going, ""Oh my god!"" But they've just been sketching Marvin the Martian.

There's no answer to this question. They just kind of move on and I don't know what their point is by the end of it.

Actually Travis does try to pull it back to give genuine advice that starts with ""encourage them"" but Griffin and Justin forcibly pull him back into the swamp of bits, where he will eventually drown and be reborn as Neo Travis, like a Dragonball villain with a second form.

Yahoo from Caitlin W: *""I went on a first date with this guy. I didn't know what to say to him?""*

She goes on a date with a guy, they went to a movie, afterwards they walked around, neither of them had much to say, it felt awkward and she wants to know what to say in the future, like topics and stuff.

Surprisingly, the ""help I'm awkward and don't know how to interact with people"" comes from Yahoo in the first episode and not the podcast's neurotic fanbase.

Here's a weird bit where the transcript attributes a line to Griffin, but as I listen to it, it is VERY clearly Justin speaking. Griffin does laugh after it, so maybe they got confused.

Griffin is delighted to read some of the answers (most of the bit about the question is the idea that a date that has an awkward moment where you don't know what to talk about can't possibly be a good date so they remark on how odd it is that she's excited for a second date). Griffin's favorite answer is from Jack Daniels (I must assume the legend himself): *""Sometimes the quietest moments can say the most about yourself.""*

I don't think that answer is as funny as the brothers are making it seem.

The rest of the bit is just them talking about how the date was clearly bad and the person is awkward. So there's that. Makes you wonder how this podcast developed the fanbase it has now.

Suzanne asks how she can add *""oh, about ten hours to her day""*. Apparently very early MBMBAM fans were mid-40s businesswomen with ""don't talk to me until I've had my coffee"" mugs.

Griffin says, not jokingly as he says, ""sleep less"". This is a terrible idea. He says ""go to sleep earlier, wake up earlier"", but that doesn't work and also that's not sleeping less which is very dangerous to your mind and body.

>Griffin: \[Sleep time\] is important but you don't have to do 13 hours of it.

*Griffin McElroy?*

>Travis: Here's the way I look at it, go to sleep later, but wake up at the same time.

That's just ""sleep less"" again!

Griffin suggests not reading, because reading takes up seconds of your day you could spend doing other things. Primary examples of things to not read are road signs and instructions for medicine, *Griffin McElroy is trying to kill you.*

Justin recommends only reading the headlines of news articles, which is terrifyingly prescient to our modern day. Griffin says to just stop reading the news, which is also that.

Justin suggests that a hug lasts 20 to 30 minutes, suggesting that no one loves quite like Justin McElroy.

>Travis: Also, stop eating.

Ryan Gan is afraid of bees, wasps, and hornets, and when they wear red shirts in the spring they tend to go near them. What do they do?

That's because bees see a bright color and go ""oh that's a flower I must go pollinate"". Hornets, on the other hand, see red, the color of rage, and immediately attack (they also attack if you're wearing any other color because they just hate you).

Justin remarks that a fear of stinging insects should be celebrated because it's rational, and Travis adds on the idea of ""being afraid of a shark swimming next to you"". Brother, you're in the shark's house. Where is the shark going to go if not the water.

Griffin says if you stop wearing a red shirt then ""the terrorist wasps will win"" and I realize it's been a long time since a ""then the terrorists will win"" joke. When I think of that phrase, I think the usage I remember is from the Kirby's Epic Yarn episode of Two Best Friends Play, which I think was their debut episode. Matt had a very unique reading on the phrase ""then the terrorists will win!"" that has lived in my head rent-free since then.

Also there's some joke about Griffin's ""outfit"" including a cock ring but you don't care about that.

There is a weird tendency in this transcript where, if a brother begins a joke, and a second brother interjects into it only for the first brother to continue and add onto that joke, the transcript attributes the rest of the joke to the second brother. As to be expected, in this case it's giving Travis credit for a Justin line.

Oh wait, it then immediately attributes a Travis line to Justin. This is all fucked up.

>Justin: The only medallions that I know of are either beef or enchanted.

Just another line I thought was particularly amusing.

>Griffin: You can also run away from them as fast as you can.

>Justin: Yeah, they are little, they are very small.

>Travis: Make sure you scream like a girl too.

I don't think I have a comment on this one.

>Griffin: These motherfuckers \[bees\], they are plump with...blood? I think?

Sure, Griffin. On that horrifying note, let's move on.

Scratty Bones on Twitter: *""How many times a week should I shampoo my hair? I'm currently on a wash thrice, shampoo every third wash cycle.""*

I just do it every other shower but I guess the Brothers McElroy are rolling up their sleeves because ""this is their wheelhouse"". Did not realize this was their expertise, actually. They should just do a hair washery podcast.

There is a long bit that's just not funny where they're giving what seems like actual advice, like they really do care about this from a personal level.

>Justin: Sunny, my gay person hairstylist at the Master Cuts...

Never mind I'm back.

>Justin: He says, ""Oh we get you some \[unintelligible\]. That's what he always says, no matter how he cuts it.

The transcript does say ""unintelligible"", as a person listening to this audio I can only describe ""a-fru-blu-bluh"".

Griffin apparently knows Sunny from ""Fantastic Sam's"" and they remark that he migrated to a hair salon, which Travis describes as a ""more gay person-friendly station"". I just cannot parse what is a bit and what isn't anymore.

Justin talks about Sunny telling him about the ""new gay bar"" he's going to and he just sort of whips up the name ""Shemanigans"" while trying to figure out what a gay bar would be called because he forgot. I do think ""Shemanigans"" is a hell of a name for a gay bar.

So Griffin apparently shampoos his hair and lets the shampoo fall and sud up his whole body and he uses that as suds, and he's saying ""by telling me to only wash my hair every three showers, you're telling me to only use soap every Wednesday and Saturday"". That seems like a Griffin problem if you'll allow me to editorialize.

>Griffin: I'm as clean as a motherfucker, but I do it in suspect ways.

Working Stiff Pro: *""Dear MBMBAM, I'm looking for love, not the sicko type, but if I find that I'm not opposed.""*

Sure. Less a question and more a demand.

>Travis: There are fucking freaks. There are freaks on the internet. Do not trust people in anything.

Submitted without comment.

>Justin: Go to a community if you're going to shop online for dudes or chicks -- uh, ladies, excuse me. Make sure it's a community you trust, like the MBMBAM community of fans.

God imagine a dating service exclusively for MBMBAM fans specifically. Imagine how many ""am I good"" submissions that would spawn.

got like seven minutes left come on let's do this. i can see the end of this transcript getting tantalizingly close.

Justin does share a pretty solid piece of advice that you can't get people interested in you but you can be interested in other people.

>Travis: And here's my secret trick, dude. When you go out and you're looking for a girl, have girls with you. Girls will trust you so much more.

I think this is actually true but why the fuck does Travis have to be saying it.

>Griffin: Or another option. Um, don't feel like you have to be in love with somebody, you know? I've got a pretty good life. I'm not you know, I'm single, no prospects.

It is kind of insane to think about how when a podcast goes for almost 15 years, you kind of watch the people involved grow up and change. Griffin was 22 when he said this, and look at him now. The fans of his podcast are using his own children as a shield against all criticism. Things change so much.

>Griffin: At 12:40 I wanted to have a hot dog and a soda, but we didn't have buns. We had some leftover brats that my brother made last night on the grill. And I cut it up--*(Justin: They were already a week old. Important to note.)*\--put it in ramen, and I didn't have soda, so I drank beer and it was 12. It was 12 o'clock. So you don't need any— You don't need— You don't— If you have someone they can tell you not to do that.

I mostly just put this in because Griffin's increasingly pathetic delivery as this line goes on was genuinely pretty funny. I could hear him become a corncob in real time.

>Griffin: Desperate times call for desperate loofahs.

You don't get context for that one.

Yahoo from Tara (top contributor): *""what is the first song that comes to mind when I say the word party?""*

For me it's either Party All The Time by Eddie Murphy or Party Rock Anthem by LMFAO. If you even care.

Griffin says the top answer is the correct one, and that it is not Party Hard by Andrew WK but that song is on there.

Party All The Time is not the top answer but is ONE of the top answers, so I feel validated.

Justin and Travis guess at Party Up in Here by DMX, All Night Long by Lionel Richie, and Hollywood Nights by Pete Seager. Other songs on the list are Birthday by the Beatles (which the brothers spit on and say is the worst song ever) and Party in the USA by Miley Cyrus.

But no, it's Shots by, oh shit, LMFAO! I didn't actually know they did that song so I was half right.

>Travis: There are two words in that song that always make me go, well, yeah. And it's buttery nipples.

This ends the podcast.

At the very least it's pretty much the end of the bit and they're going into the closing. Justin says you can send questions on Twitter using their hashtag, and you can ""use the Internet to email"" them, implying that Twitter is not the Internet. He also says this so haltingly that it sounds like he doesn't know what email is.

Griffin purports that at the end of each show, there should be a single question that they announce and ruminate on until the next week, when they've had time to think on it. Classic MBMBAM fans will know that this is The Final Yahoo.

Our first ever Final Yahoo is from Mally: *""Can birds get allergies?""* It gets some polite laughter as Root to This (the original outro) plays, and the brothers announce the end of the show. I was going to say they ""out themselves"" only to realize that is a different thing.

\---

I don't know if that was interesting. It had some classic MBMBAM Funny Moments but man, it is weird to imagine how wildly this took off. I know it's literally just the first episode and they really rose through the ranks much later on as they developed their iconically insufferable fanbase, but here, it's just three guys talking into a mic, answering questions and trying to be funny. In a way, it's kind of the genesis of all things.

I also know infamously the first hundred episodes are Bad and For Bad People, and I wasn't expecting episode 1 to be like, *directly offensive* or anything, but I will admit I was looking for things that would at least raise an eyebrow. There's a few odd ducks here and there but nothing that felt apology-worthy, at least to me. But I feel like I wouldn't be doing my jerker duty if I didn't *at least* submit the things I found odd.

I'm made of paper. Everything scares me. People especially. Nothing is trustworthy. It could break away at any moment and show I was seeing everything wrong. I was avoiding everyone out of fear and embarassment for almost 2 weeks and I stopped. I shouldn't have. They keep saying things that hurt me, and I can't say the right things to make them understand me. They don't believe me that I'm really not ok, but I'm trying as hard as I'm capible. Which doesn't seem like enough to them.(friends). 

I can't get them to understand bipolar, what it actually is like. How it is for me. How it is being treatment resistant, having tried countless meds and treatments and only gotten worse over years. So many hospitalizations, therapies, doctors. But they don't think I am trying, because if I was it would work. So they start suggesting things like going for walks, or sitting at a nice cafe... or taking less meds. and then attack me for getting frusterated. Accuse me of not wanting to get better. They think maybe if I got some more therapy, Im in therapy, I'd be better.   
  
Bipolar is neuropsychiatric condition thats nuerobiology is being heaviliy studied showing its underpinnings to genetics, miticondria, cells, epigenetics... it's so much more than a nice coffee. I appreciate their nice suggestions. But when I try to make this clear they get mad and act like Im an asshole. They say I should think positivly... I'm in a severe depressive episode on the heel of my first psychotic episode, dealing with an identity crisis, shame, embarassment, and fear from the psychosis. It's really hard to do that. 

This one ""friend"" we were talking about reading medical journals and I said the only hitch is medical jargon and he said I could use AI to make it high school reading level.. I said I can read at college level and Ive actually always been really gifted at reading.... He said yea but not comprehensions because I don't seem to comprehend things they say sometimes... He's right, it's been harder sometimes, meds, and what episode Im in and over all since I've had ECT... I've been losing cognition. One of the only things that makes me me. Having it pointed out in a mean way infront of everyone(this is all from discord)... Why am I even alive? 

I'm not me.. I'll never get better, just worse... psychosis is on the table now... my friends.. have no idea and I just need to never talk to them about my feelings or anyone else. I'm losing my intellegence. I'm disabled and its just... what. What is this. I'm not doing enough? This isn't bad enough for me to be depressed about it? Im aparently also not supposed to be sad because other people have hard times too. 

No one has any idea what it's like in my head. Maybe their right and I'm doing this all to myself... fuck I don't know. I didn't know I could go a week not being me being completly insane having no idea what was real and here we are. I need to be done.",1,1733210447.0,BipolarReddit,0,1.0,False

I got annoyed, so I just gave him a straight face while he blabbered about how he was lonely and rich, and how he thought I was young, beautiful, and perfect to be a f4cking sugar baby.

# The Start of Something Extraordinary

Our first shop wasn't just a store—it was a promise. A promise to bring value to our customers, to empower our partners, and to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the communities we call home.

Our incredible team, whose hard work and passion have driven us forward. Our distributors and partners, who have stood by us as collaborators and co-dreamers.

1h5hvhr,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1h5hvhr/why_do_they_act_like_you_never_existed/,Why do they act like you never existed?,"I understand that we can’t know what someone is thinking and / or feeling, but my situation has me so confused. 

I don’t doubt this girl loved me, I don’t doubt it at all, I can’t even explain how bad things ended and the timing of everything, honestly the timing of even starting a relationship during what was going on in both of our lives. 

I sometimes gaslight myself by telling myself that nothing was real, that maybe those feelings seemed intense because she was my ever serious relationship, that she probably never gave a fuck, and that’s why it was easy not to talk to me, but

2 years later after the break up, and you’re sharing my songs with the new person? 

He made a playlist of our song included. 

It’s not very popular, too, and it’s one of the band’s less heard songs, but MAN! 

It wasn’t a slap in the face, it was concern that I felt. 

She acts like I never existed, never reaches out, never responded to everything I’d say (to be frank, I wasn’t communicating healthy when I did reach out post break up, I was still really hurt and thankfully have recovered & learned from how I acted.) 

The girl who wanted us to get married, the girl who used to cry listening to that band with me because it reminded her of me (her words.) 

But that specific song? Really? That was from me to her. 

God, we even named our plushies to that song playing in the background. 

I mean, I’m happy she likes the band, don’t get me wrong, but then there’s the OTHER band, too! 

It’s too tender, it’s too fragile, it’s so soft, it’s us, it has us written all over it. 

I can’t help but think to myself: 

Do you really just not care that much? 

You sent me love letters, you bathed them in kisses, you couldn’t fall asleep without me there, I used to think the love I felt for you wasn’t one sided, but god, seeing that had me rethinking everything I ever thought I knew. 

I know the last year we were together was absolute hell, we were constantly fighting, but I can’t get the good moments out. 

I can’t forget the way she’d grin when I’d talk about food! Oh my gosh, she LOVED eating out! 

 I can’t forget how adorable she’d look in her onesie when she’s tired and on the verge of falling asleep, 

I can’t forget how she heartbreaking used to look when she’d cry and how soft her eyes would look, I’d just wanna pick her up and pepper kisses all over her face with soft words of reassuring her, 

I can’t forget how her lips would turn downwards when I’d play our songs for her, and she’d cry all over again, she was my little crybaby. 

I can’t forget how her voice would sound when she’d be on the verge of cussing someone out, too 😂

I can’t forget the looks we’d exchange when we’d clock someone doing something embarrassing, she had this really goofy smile she’d give me, it was like her way of letting me know that she’s trying to avoid acknowledging the embarrassing situation otherwise she’d burst out laughing, and my GOD, her laugh! 

She’d laugh with her entire body! She had such a strong laugh, she’d let out little screams in between, and idk why but those little screams in between are what would get ME to laugh 


and donuts, good god, she LOVED experimenting with donuts, I personally hated them but I’d tag along on the phone when she’d feel adventurous because she always wanted me to tag along to her endeavors (and as much I’d complain about how donuts taste, I was just looking for a way to get her to go on a yapping sessions about how tasty they are, I loved the sound of her voice so much) 


She’s such a beauty, no matter what she does, I was always enamored by her, even when she’d brush her teeth, she’d make this face: 😬 LMAO 

She had this gorgeous beauty mark, I never understood how any piece of shit could have ever made her feel bad about it, but it IS SO PRETTY!!!!!! 

When we met in person (we were LDR) I kissed it so many times because it was such a unique feature to only her :( I saw it as a signature <3 like awwwwwww this is YOU! A part of you! So beautiful

Anything that has to do with her, I loved! I cherished, I adored, I was absolutely enamored by. 

I can’t listen to the songs she dedicated to me because it would just make me cry, I can’t do it. I haven’t even been able to talk to anyone, I’ve tried, but they’re just not her. 

I don’t want to compare everyone to her, and I honestly don’t, but I just feel nothing. 

Yet somehow, I find her everywhere. 

I can’t hate the woman! I’ve tried! I know people tend to demonize their exes for how they treated them, and god, that woman made me so angry so many times in the relationship because of her tendency to name call, belittle, and say hurtful things when she’s upset, but all I could find is my own tendency to understand where it was coming from because I love her. 

God, I do. I still do. 

I love her. 

It’s so odd to admit that, let alone on a Reddit forum of all places. 

It’s been 2 fucking years, I want to move on, but my heart won’t. 

And yet, seeing that playlist he made for her, I can’t help but think: maybe he’ll give you what I couldn’t. 

Maybe he’s better for you, isn’t it? 

I don’t know if I was a good partner, sure I always wanted to know what she wanted to eat so I’d get her that, I loved showering her with gifts and clothes and trinkets, I loved getting her plushies that reminded me of her, I loved buying her coffee at any given chance, I loved when she’d take a day off from working because I’d send her money, it was my way of letting her know I’m here, you don’t need to tire yourself out, 

I had a plan to save up money to get her to med school, man it’s so sad, she really wanted to get into med school but it’s so competitive in her country, and her parents didn’t wanna fly her out to study medicine elsewhere. 

I had a place I was eyeing to buy, I wanted to ensure all of her needs were met in the 3D, and yet I neglected the emotional safety aspect, with how often we’d argue, it was no surprise. I should have just shut the fuck up instead of constantly trying to communicate and ask her why she’s withdrawing. 

But I felt it, with every argument, she was emotionally detaching. 


I was always anxious, worried about losing her, worried about her finding someone else, I self sabotaged often, it got to the point where I’d yell and panic when she’d hang up the phone, I’d spam her knowing she had work and needed to sleep, it was bad, my anxiety and fear of abandonment got the worst of me. 


In the 3D I had it all figured out, till I didn’t. It felt like everything was crumbling. Turns out my dad was terminally ill, he passed about a year later, but we broke a day after my birthday, me and her. We argued because I told her why she didn’t say anything on my birthday, and she said she didn’t know how to approach me because we fought the day prior. 

It hurt, I don’t know, I felt forgotten about, that wound was reopened. My fear of abandonment stems from feeling unworthy. 

I was often times shut down as a kid, I’m learning to go inwards with these wounds and be more gentle with them. 

I couldn’t give her the emotional safety I’ve never felt, and I feel such anger towards myself because it’s something I should have worked on. 

I was already regretful about this and even communicated that during & after our relationship, but something about that playlist kind of reaffirmed it for me. 

Kind of like a “I see” moment. I don’t know if it’s clarity, but I do know it hurts. 

All I can remember is the good, and all she can remember is the bad. It’s probably because I was the more conflict-oriented partner because of how confrontational I was about our issues, and how urgent the need to communicate felt. 

But yeah, has anyone had anything similar? 

I don’t know what to think. She was so emotionally raw with me at some point, those songs meant everything to her because they were from me, and yet, seeing her relive that with someone other than me, who dedicated those songs to her just shocks me. 

Like I’m not as important to her as I’d assumed, no wonder she never reached out, or even said anything about my father’s passing. 

It’s like none of it was real. 

It almost would feel like she let someone taint that which was special and sacred to only us, but honestly, it’s already tainted to begin with. 

How do you listen to my songs without thinking of me? I don’t get it. I’m not claiming to know, but it’s more of placing myself in her position. I don’t want to assume myself onto her, but I also have a hard time understanding it, 

With the way I feel when I listen to our songs, all I could think of is how much I miss her, and it makes me want to reach out. 

How does one just shut you out and it’s like you never existed to them? 

Do you guys think maybe she just liked the songs so much and not me? Like maybe I have a really good taste in music, I have been told this several times. 

Like she stayed up so present when I’d play these songs for her, she would cry, and say they’re so beautiful, she’d tell me how much she loves me and how special the songs are to her, but I’m so confused because she showed them to this guy, so maybe the songs were special and I wasn’t ?

Maybe that’s why to her I never existed?? 

What do you guys think?

I tried everything: medications, steroid sprays, I was getting ready for surgery 2 months ago. Nothing has worked long-term. 
Then, a friend of mine told me to quit lactose and cut out all dairy from my diet. I thought that was stupid, milk is good, I LOVE milk, I used to drink it every day with coffee, cocoa, matcha, you name it, I had about 2 pints of milk every 4 days. I never had any symptoms of lactose intolerance, I grew up in Europe in a country where everyone drinks milk. Apparently milk makes the body create mucus and that adds up to the inflammation. I've also been taking Nattokinase (it:s sold for lowering blood pressure but apparently dissolves fibrin, the stuff polyps are made of). 
Within days, my sinuses cleared up, and for the first time in years, I could breathe freely. Even in dry hotel rooms or - 10°C temperatures. 
I’m not sure if it’s the inflammation dairy was causing or something else, but the change has been life-changing. Has anyone else experienced this?",2,1733209713.0,NasalPolyps,1,1.0,False

We talked all night but didn’t exchange home numbers - this was before we had cell phones. A week later, my cousin set up a hang out at a coffee shop, which she invited him to so I could see him again, but he never showed up. I was visibly hurt, and her best friend who came with us went on and on about how I had dodged a bullet. That everyone knew he was a player who got close to girls and dumped them after he got wanted he wanted. My cousin was surprised by this because she had never heard anything bad about him. But she believed her best friend and I idolized my cousin who was older than me, so if she believed her, so did I. I felt humiliated and angry that I almost became one of his “conquests"".

A week later, I went to see my cousin at her school. He was there and when he saw me, his face lit up and he came over, extending a hand and said “hi (my name), it’s so good to see you again!” He had a huge smile on his face. I looked at him straight in the face and said “umm... do I know you?” His face fell. I walked past him and didn’t look back. I am ashamed to admit that I felt proud of myself for what I’d done for preserving my dignity and pride.

Months later, my cousin had a falling out with her best friend, who had been lying to her about all sorts of things and spreading vicious rumours about her. I realized the awful things she’d said about this guy were probably lies too. But, I never saw him again to apologize as my cousin switched schools shortly after this happened.

I learned some hard lessons from this experience:

1. Never idolize anyone, because they are people and all people are prone to making mistakes.  
2. Never take what a trusted friend says at face value.  
3. Never go for public humiliation, no matter how well-deserved you may think it is. It just makes you look like an ass.

*""Hello everybody, my Blue Merle Frenchie that I paid $4,000 for is very sick.  Even though my breeder told me that this mutated breed will have a 90% chance of developing problems with its airways, I decided to buy him anyways because he was so cute and blue.  Now the exact infection that my breeder warned about is happening, and the surgery to fix him will be $4,000.  Even though these types of vet bills are exactly what I signed up for buying a luxury dog, could you please give me money? thanks""*

  
And it seems like the GoFundMe always gets THOUSANDS of dollars.  A dog is a (smelly) luxury item.  If somebody doesnt have a few thousand dollars in emergency funds laying around, they have zero business owning one.  Imagine if I bought a Corvette, but when i break the axle I ask my friends who drive Civics to pay it for me.

I understand the glaring difference it that a Cofvette is inanimate wheras a dog is a living breathing thing.  I do think that factor should be taken seriously.  However, I think that heat should fall on the owner. They always seem to get the sympathy treatment while they're in the process of collecting everybodies hard earned cash.  

I understand that unexpected circumstances can often caused financial problems in peoples lives,  but I also think somebody should be studied more before you give them your hard earned cash.  If somebody is driving a $40,000 car and tell you they need your money to pay for a surgery, what theyre REALLY telling you is that they're nearing the point where they will have to tone down their consumerist lifestyle, and they would rather take your money instead so they can still get their daily $7 coffee and have a luxury car to drive.

# What is ""Troy Casey – Breath Is Life""?

Let’s talk about **“Troy Casey – Breath Is Life”**, a course that’s not your average deep-breathing guide. It’s a mash-up of ancient wisdom and modern wellness practices, designed to level up your health in the time it takes to (yes, he said it) *drop your post-coffee poop*. Troy Casey, also known as the Certified Health Nut, packs this program with breathing techniques, meditations, and movements to help you stress less, focus more, and maybe even sleep like a baby.

# Who is This Course For?

Ever felt like your brain is foggy, your stress levels are sky-high, or your energy tank is running on fumes? **“Breath Is Life”** is for anyone looking for a quick, effective way to fix those issues without spending hours in a yoga studio. Whether you're a newbie to breathwork or a seasoned wellness junkie, Troy’s approach meets you where you’re at.

# When Can You Start Seeing Results?

Here’s the exciting part—some techniques in the course might offer instant results. You know that “ahh” moment when you finally exhale after a stressful day? Imagine getting that every day, but on steroids (the metaphorical kind). Over time, with consistency, you can unlock better sleep, reduced anxiety, and heightened clarity.

# Where Does All This Wisdom Come From?

Troy draws inspiration from a blend of ancient practices like yoga, qigong, and tai chi, but he doesn’t shove labels down your throat. It’s all about practical, no-fluff tools that fit into your daily life. If you’re rolling your eyes at terms like “pranayama,” don’t worry—Troy is all about making it accessible.

# Why Should You Try It?

Let’s face it, most of us don’t breathe properly. Troy dives into the *how* of breathing to help you fix those bad habits. Better breathing equals better health, and it’s not just woo-woo talk. Science backs it: proper breathwork can lower cortisol levels, improve mental focus, and even boost energy.

# How Does It Work?

The course includes:

* **Powerful breathwork exercises** that go beyond simple inhales and exhales.
* **Chi-gong movements** for energy and vitality.
* **Meditations galore**—we’re talking over 30!
* Tools to improve sleep, reduce depression, and elevate consciousness.

Troy breaks it all down into bite-sized lessons that are easy to follow and, more importantly, fun.

# Final Thoughts

“Troy Casey – Breath Is Life” isn’t just another wellness trend; it’s a reset button for your body and mind. Whether you’re chasing better sleep, focus, or just want to feel more grounded, this course promises to deliver. So, take a deep breath—literally—and give it a go.

He seems genuine and has a good heart, and he  introduced me to his family. However, I feel unsure about him, and I don't know if I am overthinking it, or are my thoughts valid.

I (27F) have been dating my (37M) boyfriend for three months. Him and I have established our intentions from day one, that we're both dating to get married. Everything was going well. I met his family recently and they seem to be sweet. I connect with him well and I feel safe with him.

The summary of the day I met his family is as follows: (there's a reason why I am mentioning the details) 

He found a car (he was looking to buy one previously) , dropped his dad at the barbershop with the old car , went to get the new car , then came to pick me up.

I met his dad (he is partially blind) , things went well . Then it was time for us to leave. They have both cars:  the old and the new cars (the one he bought that day) parked outside of the coffee shop where we met. My boyfriend was going to let his dad drive one of the cars and asked him to follow him on the road. I told my boyfriend "" are you crazy for letting your dad drive? He can barely see. "" 

I offered to drive one of the cars to drop his dad off, and eventually meet at their place. The dad appreciated the gesture and we ended up talking about religion and politics on the way (things were going well). 

Me being me, I thought everything was ok. Until this day, my boyfriend still appreciates that I helped him out in that situation. (Please do not think that I am a selfish person because I helped them that day or that I am trying to make it sound like it's his fault). I totally understand love and support goes both ways and that it takes two to make a relationship work.

After that day, my head started going in circles. I could not stop thinking about how he was going to let his dad drive that day. It made me wonder if I ever get in trouble, will I ever be supported by him? If I were in his dad's place, or if I had given birth or gone through a traumatizing incident, will he treat me like I should figure things out on my own?

Maybe I have not clarified the depth or the further details that happened throughout that day, but it was that specific incident that's making my thoughts spiral out of control. I am writing this to ask if I am overthinking it or is my concern valid?",1,1733208215.0,relationships,3,1.0,False

Post this he got vanished for 15 days saying he is going to his home town for Navratri and he had to prepone the plan coz his dad is not well. His location on bumble was switched off and he didn’t communicate me at all for those 12-15 days. But he again came back apologized saying he was caught up with dads health and hospitalization. He asked me out over dinner and we went for dinner and we drank and danced. And he seemed all into me during dance. So I got carried away a bit. He asked me to come over at his place for dinner as we both were hungry, pots dinner at his place I booked a cab and he came to my place to drop me and next moment I know we were making out in my bedroom.

I went all panicky. He after lot of drama accepdet that he is dating this girl and he lied to me about his trip to native. I still continued talking to him and I feel he sensed my emotional desperation and he kept me bread crumbing for few days and then we met again once and he said she is just someone he is seeing casually and he wants a serious relationship with me and he is ready to leave that girl. But even after this discussion he was inconsistent in communication and every weekend he was travelling to his native coz his dad isn't well and some random stuffs. And he was in town only for one day in week. this all went for 1.5 month. I said I don't trust him as its not possible that he is travelling every weekend to his native coz he has lied to me on this in past, and I can prove his lying and I am going to contact the other girl on this.

I come to you with nowhere else to turn. My 30 year old brother with cerebral palsy and debilitating mental health challenges was illegally evicted a few days ago in the beginning of an extremely cold Canadian winter. After moving in a few months ago and giving both first and last months rent given to him from disability, the landlord decided to move in a family member without serving papers or doing anything above board. To further this, when my brother started asking questions, the landlord forcibly grabbed him by the sweater and tossed him out of the house. We are currently in contact with a lawyer, he said that my brother is within his right to fight for his money, but conclusions can take up to a year. Disability worker told him he’s only entitled to first and last months rent once a year and because he doesn’t have a fixed address, his monthly disability will be reduced to just the basic needs portion. I guess what I’m asking is if we could have any financial support just to get him by for now and to secure a place as fast as possible. We also need assistance in any way whether well wishes, ins and outs of the system etc. He’s been wandering the streets with just the clothes he was wearing. Where he lives doesn’t have 24/7 coffee shops and the library closes fairly early.  He’s out in the cold and it’s only going to get colder from here. I’m so angry on his behalf.

1h5h4pm,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1h5h4pm/what_teeth_whitening_is_the_best/,What Teeth Whitening Is the Best?,"When it comes to teeth whitening, there’s no shortage of options. From toothpaste and strips to professional treatments at the dentist, each promises to give you a whiter smile. But which method really works, and which one is right for you? After testing a variety of approaches, I found myself returning to **Laughland Teeth Whitening**, and here’s why.

# Why Teeth Whitening Can Be Tricky

Not all teeth whitening methods are created equal. Surface stains from coffee or tea are easier to tackle, but deeper discoloration caused by smoking, aging, or genetics often needs something more intensive. Many products only address surface stains and leave you frustrated with minimal results.

Some methods, like whitening strips, can be uneven, while others, like professional treatments, come with a hefty price tag. The question becomes: how do you get professional-level results without spending a fortune or dealing with painful sensitivity?

# My Search for the Best Teeth Whitening Method

I’ve tried toothpaste, strips, and even DIY remedies (spoiler: don’t try baking soda and lemon—it’s bad for your enamel). While some of these methods worked a little, they were either too time-consuming or left me with sensitive teeth. That’s when I started researching **Laughland Teeth Whitening**, which popped up in multiple reviews as a reliable option.

# What Sets Laughland Apart?

**Laughland Teeth Whitening** combines a professional-grade formula with an easy-to-use design. The kit includes:

* **Whitening Gel**: Dentist-formulated and stored in a temperature-controlled environment to maintain potency.
* **LED Mouthpiece**: Activates the gel to whiten teeth more effectively.
* **Simple Instructions**: Just 10 minutes a day for noticeable results.

After trying Laughland, I noticed real improvements within a few days. My teeth became significantly whiter without the sensitivity that other products caused.

# My Results with Laughland

By day three, my teeth looked brighter. By day six, the results were dramatic—up to 7 shades whiter. The best part? It’s gentle. I could eat and drink normally without that sharp, zinging sensitivity I’d experienced with other methods.

If you’re curious about how Laughland works or want to learn more, [**check it out here**](https://getlaughland.com/offer-01/?lpid=1039&source_id=DL&utm_source=8928&utm_medium=&utm_term=1039&aff_id=8928&sub_id=&req_id=&oid=1039&device_type=&country_name=&oid=1039&affid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HealthProductsNatural)**.**

# Final Thoughts on the Best Whitening Option

So, what teeth whitening is the best? For me, it’s been **Laughland Teeth Whitening**. It balances effectiveness, ease of use, and comfort, making it one of the most reliable options I’ve tried. Whether you’re dealing with surface stains or deeper discoloration, this kit is worth considering.

Feel free to share your experiences or ask questions—I’d love to hear what’s worked (or hasn’t) for others!
