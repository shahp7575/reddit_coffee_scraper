1ivhfib,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimLounge/comments/1ivhfib/i_dont_like_my_parents_but_islam_says_i_have_to/,I don’t like my parents but Islam says I have to love and respect them.,"My parents are the reason I have been in dysfunctional relationships my whole life. I have always attracted narcissistic and emotionally people until I saw the cycle and broke it. 

This is because my mother is narcissistic and lies about everything. She never admits fault. My dad is emotionally unavailable and seems to throw digs at me. 

For example, my mother has broke my coffee glass for the third time and refused to admit it and replace it. She was blaming it on others. Regarding my dad, he randomly brought up the other day that we won’t be paying anything for your wedding. I don’t even have a potential so why would you even say this. He seems to have a problem that I’m living at home and saving my own money to get married and move out one day. Always saying comments to me you are living in this house free! Never says it to my brothers though. 

He also made remarks saying that I won’t get a husband good enough. I just find it odd because a real good Muslim man would not say things like this to his daughter. A father is supposed to treat her daughter like a princess. It’s not like I ask for money from him! 

My parents gang up on me and say I’m disrespectful for getting angry and yelling when I confronted them. However, I am fed up. I know it is wrong to yell but when these things build up over time I lost it. I have experienced tough situations in life because my parents never displayed real love or shown real love in the household. 

I was never religious in the past and was thrown more into cultural things. Neither of my parents pray and my mother does not practice hijab. I have learned to pray and practice hijab all on my own. I feel like I have gaps in my knowledge about Islam because my parents never taught me! 

How can I be expected to love parents like this because I don’t think I do? I want to have my own space badly but can’t until I’m married. I won’t be rushing into marriage for this reason though. ",2,1740226465.0,MuslimLounge,0,1.0,False

1ivhdlg,https://www.reddit.com/r/WanderingInn/comments/1ivhdlg/author_note_chapter_delay_until_next_saturday/,"AUTHOR NOTE: Chapter delay until next Saturday, March 1st","I woke up with my right ear ringing nonstop and itching. I’ve scheduled an appointment with an expert, but I think it’s either an ear infection or something else like earwax compaction. Either way, it’s nonstop. The itching is worse.

Not what I need right now. The other part is that I have finished this next chapter. It is 70,000 words + the ending of 10.34, which is a third of a chapter in of itself. Editing in two days would be nearly impossible, regardless of the ear problems.

The beta-reader response is coming in now; I just finished writing. However, I agree with one comment that reads:

‘This is like v8/v9 ending where people need to see the whole piece at once to not, like, die’

It must be told well, and for that I need time, as I warned you. Call this my monthly week off? Did I already take it? I’m not sure. I’m drinking coffee to stay functional and losing track of the days. But I do think this chapter, and the next, will be the last two.

And an epilogue, obviously, but it could well be under 20,000 words. Who knows, but I will take till the 1st for this one.

With apologies, and thank you for understanding. I will release an Enuryn comic on Saturday instead.

We talk more openly now, sharing personal details and inside jokes, and there’s this playful energy between us that feels different from my other coworker relationships.

For context, I’m more masc-presenting, and she’s super femme—not that it matters, but I feel like it subtly signals that I’m queer. When we first met, I wouldn’t have expected us to become as close as we are now.

At first, our conversations were strictly about work, but over time, we started hanging out more—talking during breaks, joking around, and lingering in conversation. She does little things that make me second-guess whether this is just friendship or something more. She lets me borrow her hoodie at work when I’m cold (I’ve offered her mine before), pouts at me when she’s hungry or wants coffee, and always wants my opinion on clothes she’s thinking of buying. When I suggest something, she seems genuinely interested. And in the past, she’s even looked disappointed when I put my headphones in, knowing it meant we wouldn’t be able to chat as much.

Then, there was the festival. We both ended up there from work, but I lost my friends, my phone died, and my ride home disappeared. I ended up being the fourth wheel, but she shrugged it off, saying that without me, she would’ve been third-wheeling anyway.

At the end of the night, she invited me to her place to charge my phone. She made me tea, gave me a hoodie to wear, and we sat on her bed while she took off her makeup. She shared a personal, funny story—something that wouldn’t come up at work. Then she casually mentioned I could stay over. I hesitated, unsure of what she meant by it. She kept saying, “It’s up to you,” and eventually, I decided to go home, mostly to avoid any awkwardness in the morning. If I had stayed, we would’ve been in her bed, and I think I would’ve left feeling even more confused.

I’ve shared a bed with friends before, and normally, it wouldn’t be a big deal. But this felt different—maybe because of our dynamic, or the fact that this was my first time at her place. We aren’t exactly close friends or even outside-of-work friends yet, which makes me wonder…

You don’t just casually suggest something like that unless you’re extremely comfortable—or at least a little curious, right?

There’s a part of me that wonders if I’m imagining things. But at the same time, I think there’s massive chemistry.

TLDR: My coworker \[25F\] and me \[25F\] have built a good work relationship and I think she might be flirting with me. I'm trying to navigate this without overstepping or miscalculating.",0,1740226239.0,relationship_advice,1,0.5,False

Hi neighbors,

I’m exploring the idea of starting a coworking space in Alameda and would love to get your thoughts. I currently work from home, and while coffee shops and libraries are decent, I often find myself wishing for a space that’s a little more relaxed than a traditional office but still has a strong sense of community.

I’d love to know:
	•	What do you like (or dislike) about the current coworking options?
	•	Would a flexible, maybe even pop-up coworking space spark your interest?
	•	What features or dealbreakers would influence your decision to join?

Any feedback would be super helpful as I try to figure out if there’s a real need for this. Thanks a bunch!

Also- I’m excited about this idea and would love to work with other locals to shape it! If you’re interested in helping out or have ideas, please drop a comment or send me a message.",1,1740225771.0,alameda,0,1.0,False

It’s a coffee shop job at at well-known chain but I think the manager is acting outside the law in a lot of ways and I’m uncertain about how to proceed. He’s made it clear that he wants certain people to leave and is apparently very rude and hostile towards them. If a customer card declines and they leave the shop without us noticing he’ll request that we pay for the customer’s meal rather than writing it off as staff error (certain members of staff have actually paid for this). Under the “company policy” we aren’t allowed to accept any tips, however I’m uncertain as to whether this is actually in our contract as I can’t recall it saying this when I signed. If we are on a close we do not get paid past our time, even if we have been busy and have to stay behind. This means that supervisors are missing out on hours of wages if they have to stay behind for 15 minutes over a few days. An assistant manager apparently left because he asked her to pay to cover the cost of any milk wasted on shift, but this was before I started. I’m not yet out of my probationary period and I have yet to join a union, but will obviously join one when I next get paid. I’m just not sure what the due processes would be, as only one girl has formally submitted complaints about him. I’m not yet out of my probationary period and I’m not planning on staying long term, but is there anything I can do? ",1,1740225689.0,LegalAdviceUK,2,1.0,False

Hi internet stranger ! I’m just a girl (cue the song ) . I’m hoping to meet a dumbass who is into dumbassery just as much as I am . Some one to text and share stupid stuff with on the daily .So if you have a dash of dumbassery , a galactic twinkle in your eye and think you’re able to hold a conversation* ( mega important ) let’s be friends ;) 

First abit about me : I’m writing this while while having a smoke and watching Dutch streamers react too a show called “lang leve de liefde”   .sometimes I’m funny but don’t ask me to tell a joke ( that’s not how it works bro ) fun fact I hate movies and also ice cream( no I don’t have reasons why I just don’t , it’s not that deep ). I have adhd and think about a million thoughts a second it feels like . I like reading watching the most random shit on YouTube , baking , walking , making a million playlists that I’ll never listen to again and adding them to my iPod for optimal vibes  and journaling. I speak 3 languages and am learning a 4th ! I love dogs 100% but cats 101% .that’s about it nothing special . 

**Things to expect if we become friends**

- Goodmorning messages (might not be sent in the morning 🫶🏻)
- a lot of random playlists I’ve made 
- complaints about nonsensical things ( example the weather , how much milk cows produce , songs I wish didn’t exist ?)
- someone that you can annoy at any time of  the day 
- someone to have coffee dates with virtually ( no you don’t have to drink coffee I certainly will ) 
- just someone willing to listen to your rambles /ideas/thoughts/feelings 
-Dutch memes but you won’t get ;) ( what a steal ! )

My wife was hosting her book club so I went by myself and sat a 2-top near the back.

A 4-top of young women spent the first half hour talking loudly about me, the pervert, sitting by himself. It was strange.

During the break after the first set. A girl in her mid-20s came up to me, chatted for a minute or two, handed me something, gave me a quick hug, and then walked away. The other table went on a rant about how I was on a Tinder date. They thought I must have given a fake picture on my profile. They wondered loudly if they should call the cops.

If they had shown even the slightest interest in anything outside of their self-righteousness.... they would have noticed the person who came up to talk to me was the lead singer with the band.

The thing she handed me was a frame containing a flier for tonight's show and a flier for a show that I took her, my daughter, and their friends to when they were teenagers interested in learning more about live music.

After high school she went on to study music and became a music teacher. On the weekends, she performs with her band. This was her first show back in our area.

She wanted to thank me for all the carpools I drove and nights I spent drinking coffee at local venues while she, my daughter, and their friends soaked in the local music scene when they were kids.

When doing so I gave the techs a box of local donuts and a box of Dutch brothers coffee.

Well it turns out it wasn't my U joint but my whole rear drive line was toast. 

The hangar bearings were gone, the bracket for them wore a groove into the driveshaft, all 3 u joints on the driveshaft were toast, and the furthest rear one was completely gone, holding on by sheer willpower alone.

They quoted me 700+ to fix it.

I picked up the truck on Friday morning. Apparently the tech stayed late on his own time to finish my truck so I could pick it up in the morning.

He told me that ""he owed me at least that much for the coffee and donuts that made everyone happy""

Next time I drop the beast off for repairs, I owe him more than just coffee and donuts. On top of that, he only charged me for parts and the other shops labor where they sent my drive line out for rebuilding. Came out to 530 dollars and my truck drives like new.

I guess one good will gesture gets one in return. So remember to share the love with your tech today.

We're watching One Piece currently, started from scratch and hit the 1000th episode just in 4 months.

I’d really love to find some new friends who might share these interests—or who just want to swap stories about everyday life.

1ivgqbw,https://www.reddit.com/r/ticktick/comments/1ivgqbw/through_improved_habit_tracker_towards_behavior/,Through improved Habit tracker towards Behavior Modification GOD MODE? ^^,"Ok guys, here are some suggestions on how to improve the Habit tracker.

The first few points would be easy to implement, building a more flexible *Behavior Tracker.*  


While the last addition would basically be game-changing, putting a broadly applicable *behavior modification tool* directly in the users hands. Note that this would not prevent “only” using the Habit tracking features.



**1. Negative Goals**

Set Goals as a *maximum* \- including zero. A lot of  behavior changes mean doing *less* of something: Snacking, vaping, time on social media etc.

  


**2. Composite Goals**

As an example, recommendations for safe alcohol consumption may be something like:

\-  “no more than 10 units per week AND no more than 4 units on any one day.” 

Should also be possible to set as *combination* of positive/negative:  - “At least X/week AND no more than Y/day”

\- “At least A/week AND at least B/day Weekdays AND no more than C/day Weekends”. 

You get it.

  


**3. Keep count past Goal**

If Goal is set to do more/less than X, but I in fact pass X I can no longer keep track of that behavior. Let's say my Goal is set to read 30 pages a day but I do read 40, and that’s a good thing? Or, with a goal of no more than 30 minutes of social media, 31 minutes is currently equal to 4 hours of doom scrolling - failing the Habit. Way too blunt. 

Fail/pass of Goal should be shown but actual value reached for time period still kept track of with options on how to display results (actual number on red/green background?)   
  


**4. Track Data without Goal**

It can be very useful to keep track of behavior Data without a related Goal. 

I may for example want to track how much coffee I drink without having decided on a goal.Or track hours of sleep I get. Etc etc.This broaden the scope of trackable Data beyond behaviors - things *done* \- to things that may be *casually* related to behaviors, in CBT often referred to as *Antecedent* and *Consequences*.

This builds on simple Habit tracking towards the much more powerful realm of *behavior analysis* later on.

  


**5. Tag Habits**

To exemplify, let’s say I track individual exercises - like Squats - as Habits (more on how to maybe better organize them under point 9 below). 

I also track various aches and pains, using simple integer numbers as scales:

 \- Right runners knee, Pain (1-5).It would make sense to Tag exercises that tend to load a body part to connect it to relevant tracked Data like pain/dysfunction, medication, joint supplements etc as well as to Tasks and Notes that may relate to programming, rehab, prehab, treatments etc.  


Different Tags would be used to track different relations resulting in different groupings: - Pain: (all causes), sleep, mood, painkillers..

\- Knees: right runners knee, left patellar tendonitis, squats, lunges..- Joints: (all joint issues), relevant supplements, treatments.. No separate “Habit Tags” then - just the ability to tag Habits.



**6. Input Timer**

Make one of the input options for a Habit a Timer one can start/stop for each instance of the behavior, that keep track of the TOTAL time for the relevant time period/s (day, week etc). 

This could be used to keep track of both positive and negative goals - time spent on deep work vs. gaming breaks etc - and could be combined with a Pomodoro-like prompt to take (or break..) a break after a certain time each instance, while keeping track of total time, all in one function. 

Let user edit the count manually if forgotten to turn off.



**7. Timestamps**

Knowing *when* each logged Instance of a Habit is completed could be very useful for understanding many behaviors. The time of day you had that last cup of Coffee may have a significant effect on sleep, the spacing of medication on symptoms etc.

It also makes possible: 

  


**8. Reminder a set time after last Instance**

Let's say I want to do something every 2 hours, with a total of 4 times a day. 

Taking X mg of Adderall to manage ADHD symptoms during a workday for example. 

First I need to be able to make a Composite Goal of 4/day AND every 2 h *within* the day.I *could* then set 4 daily reminders 2h apart for the Habit *but* in reality we seldom follow schedules this precisely, forcing either cumbersome on-the-fly editing or dysfunction - if you need the next meds after 2 hours but forgot taking them for one hour last instance you *don’t* want to be reminded again after only one hour..     

Having the option to automatically be reminded 2h after the last time *one did X* would solve this. 

It should be possible to enter a time other than when one is actually making the input (default), since people sometimes miss registering stuff immediately, due to circumstances or human factor.) 

  


**9. Complex/Hierarchical Habits**

Could Parent-/Sub-Habits and/or Lists be used to organise Habits?

Example: I have a supplement stack of around 10 supplements, some daily, some on certain days of the week, some with on/off periods etc.Over time the details may change by plan - I stop/start/exchange something. 

There may also be unplanned day-to-day variations (Ops - out of Zinc). 

Tracking this as 10+ separate habits would be very impractical. Combining all as Sub-Habits of a “Supplements” Parent Habit (or List?) would allow for automatically adjusting for planned variety every day - with the option of *manually* adjusting individual “Sub Habits” (crossing out that missing Zinc) while still ticking the Parent task as completed in one go (Check *Supplements* \+ Uncheck *Zink*?)

Note that the individual Sub-Habits must be *tracked as separate Data*. 

The Parent Habit is a *container* for overview and convenience, as well as something to be tracked separately.  

Other obvious examples here would be things like Workouts or various Routines, like morning, cleaning, maintenance etc.  
  
Maybe Individual Habits need to be part of more than one Parent Habit/List.

I may be Squatting as part of 2 out of 4 Workouts i alternate between, and some warmup/prehab/mobility stuff will be part of almost every workout for example.

This also raises the question of multi-level Habits: How about tracking sets/reps/weights for an Exercise within a Workout for example. Similar with aspects of diet.

I’ll leave this one as a thought for now. Likely it would need to be considered in connection with a general multi level/complexity rework featuring nesting, multiple instances, backlinks etc for Task and Notes as well that may or may not happen at some point.  


But now for the big Kahuna:

  


**10. Correlations**

Once we have generated a sufficient dataset by tracking Behaviors and other relevant Data for some time we can explore and analyse it.

Just running simple X/Y correlations and present the user with a list in order of strength could be a very powerful tool to quantify patterns - ie what *is* the difference between 3 and 4 cups of coffee on hours slept and sleep quality? - as well *discover* ones that are not immediately  obvious - side effects of medications, subtle differences in mood or symptoms etc etc.  

One should of course be able to quickly hide correlations that seem meaningless (bacon/eggs = 0.74) from the active list (but find them again if needed).

Another tool could be a Graph showing curves for selected tracked Data, with zoomable time scale to make possible connections visible. 

This is all about spotting patterns that humans are very bad at doing reliably, just looking at disorganised data then leveraging any insights to change one's own behavior in desired directions - by what we track and what goals we set. 

Rinse and repeat and that’s basically behavior therapy, but supported by a constantly growing individual data-set and tweaked process. 

It could be used with external resources - from operationalizing a self-help program to collab with others, professional or not, all within the users own control.  



I imagine there would be a limit to the level of statistical analysis could feasibly be done *within* TickTick. 

In a perfect world there would be some sort of global multivariate stuff magic on - with Ai on top -  but probably the limit would be something like the above - which would still be uniquely powerful. 

Therefore, add:



**11. Behavior Data export**

Let the user export *selected* behavior data separately from the backup function and in a format that can be directly imported and analysed in Excel or Sheets - and (maybe from there) into more powerful statistics tools if available. This could also be used to share relevant data as basis for collab with external partners, like coaches or therapists.

And there you have it. Enjoy!

I once read that dogs understand the concept of death and to let them sniff your corpse so they know what happened. Otherwise they will think you abandoned them. 

It's been a while, longer than should be healthy, but it has bothered me a lot and for a while. My fiancée who I was in a relationship with for 10 years cheated. I had to fix a mortgage, buy a place, renovate and move out all within 3 months. I cut off all contact with her. Blocked her number, blocked her on all social media etc. I don't give a shit about her or what she is up to.

But we did adopt 2 kittens from the shelter. They were sad cases. One was a black and white kitten found in a box beside a cycling path and the other was a grey kitten found abandoned in the woods. The black and white kitten turned out fine. She was the sweetest thing in the world. The grey kitten not so much. I think because she was abandoned at a very early age. Very shy and scared, couldn't meow (still couldn't after 8 years, she tried but it came out as a hiss or squeek) still sucking her ""thumb"" way after what was normal. And drooling all over the place. She only showed up when we were around but otherwise she would hide. Whe changed the carpet beneath the coffee table once and it freaked her out so much she went into Anne Frank mode for 4 days. 

They originally were both put in a foster family with other shelter animals and the grey kitten started following the black and white one everywhere. The shelter decided they should only be adopted as a pair. They said the grey kitten thought the black and white one was her mother. If that's the case I don't know but doesn't matter. It would put too much stress on the grey kitten if she was separated and left alone. So we took them both.

I loved those cats, and still love them. But after her cheating and me moving out I made the decision that they should both stay with her. The new place is too high up for them, I couldn't separate them, and the change would have screwed up the grey cat (then around 8 years old going on 10.5 now) too much. So I left them with her. I'm over her but have no need to ever see her face again. But I still think of my cats weekly, sometimes daily. Even writing this is hard.

Now for the question. Is the dog thing the same with cats? Do they think I just abandoned them? As shitty as it sounds I kinda hope they don't give a crap and forgot about me after a week.

I didn’t notice it on the plant I got from her the black spots. And I didn’t check. I wanted to have a jade tree and in my excitement I just  placed it next to my orchids. Perfect spot. Plenty of light but not too much direct sunlight. 

Not even a month later when I was dusting the orchids and the small jade, getting ready to repot it I noticed on the leaves of the jade black spots. A lot of them. I ask my friend if her plant has these spots and she confirms that it does indeed and that’s how the plant is. I haven’t been to this friend’s house in over a year. Usually we meet at mines for coffee or dinner. 


I realised is black spots fungus, and I decided I can’t risk my orchids and other plants so I threw it away. Pot and all. Checked my other plants no spots in sight and went about my day. 

My doom was not treating what appeared to be my healthy plants with fungicide preemptively. 2 of my orchid are affected and I am desperately trying to save them. Cleared all the affected parts and treating them with fungicide as soon as it’s delivered. 

I wanted to cry. One of the orchids is the one with the seed pods. In about 4-5 months the pods would have matured enough to be harvested. I have grown and cared for those pods and orchid 6 months already. 

I am heartbroken. But I learned a valuable lesson. Never ever I am going to get a plant from friends. And I will quarantine all new plants. I had those 2 orchids for more than 5 years. Never had any plant disease apparat from some gnats. That I properly got rid of with insecticide.

Context: Nakasama ko sya sa isang group during our college days and halos every day magkasama kami dahil yung part/work namin sa group na yon is connected so kumbaga partners kami. Naging super close kami kaagad kase magaan syang kasama and he’s really friendly, super nagkasundo talaga kaming dalawa. At first super soft ng treatment nya towards me, sya lang din kase yung ka-close ko sa group that time, tapos lagi rin kaming nag ha-hangout na kaming dalawa lang kaya tinutukso rin kami palagi. 

Marami syang ginagawa para sa akin na never nyang ginawa sa ibang girls na ka-group namin, tulad ng paghahatid nya sakin pauwi sa bahay lalo na kapag late na kaming nakakauwi, minsan nga kahit maliwanag pa ihahatid nya ako. Lagi rin syang open ears sa mga rants ko tapos papagaanin nya yung loob ko after. Inaaya nya rin ako to go out para mag study ng weekends. Marami pang iba ganon, napapansin din nung ibang kagrupo namin yung actions nya towards me dahil sakin lang sya ganon.

I wasn’t sure about my feelings pa sakanya nung una kaya parang tropa tropa yung trato ko sakanya, pero nung sure na ako na gusto ko sya I started treating him na din in a different way that I treat the other guys sa group. Kaso that’s when he started to treat me like a tropa, pero pag kaming dalawa lang he’s back to being soft.

I wanted to confess sakanya before Christmas break kaso bigla syang nag open up sakin na he like someone na daw kaya umatras ako. He confessed, got rejected, then after a few months ako naman nag confess sakanya. He only asked me to stop liking him, it turns out may ka-MU pala sya. (Di ko alam na may ka-MU sya non kase di na nya nakekwento)

Umiwas ako, ilang months din yon tapos wala na rin ata sila nung ka-MU nya, halos monthly naman siyang nagpaparamdam sakin. So naging close kami ulit, lumalabas for coffee, I kinda had hope na baka this time may chance kami.

What should I do?,"I want to preface this post with that my sister has been in a long term relationship that's very toxic. Over the years her partner is assaulted her and she has assaulted them but in the end they always get back together. Everything took a turn for the worse when I decided to move in with my sister into a new apartment. Her and her boyfriend had weekly fights and at any moment they could have screaming matches like rabid animals. It got to the point where I could hear them arguing even if they weren't because I was so used to it as background noise. One day they had a fight and I fed up intervened and told him to shut up and that led to her boyfriend to her boyfriend choking me out in my own apartment and afterwards she sided with him. 

While everyone agrees that my sister is in the wrong it feels like everyone is letting her off easy because the only repercussion she is facing is that she can't visit if I'm around and her boyfriend is no longer allowed at family events too. No one is acknowledging her hand in all the trauma and toxicity and it is starting to bother me. 
I have nightmares of when her bf attacked me and how she tried covering for him and when I mention it people either just don't acknowledge it or tell me to let it go. 

At this point I am unsure if it unreasonable to ask people who I feel like am close with to cut her off or do something to acknowledge her hand in it all.

Another list of things they did that have scarred me:

-Her bf once threw coffee in my face because I told him to leave after she asked him to.

- He refered to me and my brother as ""things"" and ""creatures"" one time when he got physical and said he wasn't scared of us

-He threatened to unalive their dogs after they ""broke up""

-She threatened to kill herself on my birthday because they had a bad fight

-She tried moving him into our apartment even though he was jobless and running up the electricity bill that I paid

- She let him smoke weed in our apartment even though that violated our lease

The Cambrians resemble Humans, while the Ancients resemble Mantis-like humanoids.) The Cambrians are arrogant, and care nothing for their vast resources and are very wasteful, while the Ancients are very conservative with their limited resources. This led them to live in peace for like 20 years, before growing resentful as the Cambrians got jealous of the Ancient’s many metals, while the Ancients were bitter with how wasteful the Cambrians were with their food that the Ancients  could have so badly used. This led to the Great Land War. Now our main character, an Ancient Male who’s handy with daggers.

# Why NordVPN is Worth Every Penny (Even Without a Discount)

Before we get to the juicy discount details, let’s talk about why NordVPN is the king of VPNs. If you’re new to the VPN game, NordVPN isn’t just any service—it’s a fortress for your online life. Here’s why millions (including me) swear by it:

* **Military-Grade Encryption**: Your data’s locked up tighter than Fort Knox with AES-256 encryption. Hackers? ISPs? They don’t stand a chance.
* **Global Server Network**: Over 6,000 servers in 60+ countries mean lightning-fast speeds and unrestricted access to geo-blocked content. Netflix US from anywhere? Done.
* **No-Logs Policy**: NordVPN doesn’t track or store your activity. What happens on NordVPN stays... well, nowhere. Total anonymity, guaranteed.
* **Blazing Speeds**: Stream, game, or torrent without lag. I’ve binged entire seasons in 4K without a hiccup.
* **24/7 Support**: Got a question at 3 AM? Their live chat has your back.

NordVPN’s premium features come with a premium price tag—unless you know where to look for discounts. Spoiler: Reddit’s the goldmine, and I’ve got the treasure map!

# The Holy Grail: NordVPN Discount Code Reddit 75% Off

Picture this: a 2-year NordVPN plan that normally costs $223 slashed down to just $56. That’s right—**75% off**, dropping your monthly cost to as low as $2.33! This isn’t some sketchy third-party scam; it’s a legit deal floating around Reddit’s deal-hunting communities. I’ve tested it, and it works like a charm as of today, **February 22, 2025**. Here’s how you can grab it:

1. **Scour the Right Subreddits**: Head to r/VPNDeals, r/coupons, or r/Frugal. These are where Redditors drop the hottest NordVPN promo codes. Search “NordVPN discount code 75% off” and sort by “new” to catch the latest posts.
2. **Look for Verified Codes**: Check comments for user feedback. If someone says “Worked for me 2 hours ago!” with upvotes, you’re golden. One code I found recently? **“**click [here](https://www.appreviewhub.co.uk/2025/02/how-to-score-nordvpn-coupon-code-for-75.html)**”**—try it at checkout!
3. **Act Fast**: These deals are time-sensitive. The 75% off offer often ties to long-term plans (like 2 years) and can vanish during sales like Black Friday or Cyber Monday. Don’t sleep on it!
4. **Apply It Right**: Go to [NordVPN’s official site](https://www.appreviewhub.co.uk/2025/02/how-to-score-nordvpn-coupon-code-for-75.html), pick your plan, and paste the code at checkout. Watch that price plummet—I literally cheered when I saved $167!

Pro tip: If “2YCOUPON” doesn’t work, try “Redditoffer” or “1YCOUPON” for a 1-year plan with 60-67% off + extra months free. Reddit’s always buzzing with fresh codes, so keep digging!

# Why Reddit’s the Secret Sauce for NordVPN Discounts

You’re probably wondering, “Why not just Google it?” Here’s the deal: Reddit’s community-driven nature means real people share real discounts—no fluff, no fake codes. Unlike random coupon sites, Redditors call out expired deals and upvote the legit ones. Plus, you can ask questions and get instant replies. I once posted in r/VPN asking for a NordVPN code and got three replies in 10 minutes—talk about clutch!

The 75% off NordVPN discount code is a fan favorite because it’s often tied to exclusive Reddit promos or seasonal sales. Pair it with NordVPN’s 30-day money-back guarantee, and you’ve got a risk-free shot at elite security for peanuts.

# What You’re Getting with This Deal

Let’s break it down. With the 75% off NordVPN discount code from Reddit, here’s what $56 (or less!) gets you over 2 years:

* **Unbreakable Privacy**: Hide your IP, dodge trackers, and stay invisible online.
* **Streaming Freedom**: Unlock Netflix, Hulu, BBC iPlayer—you name it. I watched *The Office* US from Europe flawlessly.
* **Top-Notch Security**: Double VPN, Onion Over VPN, and CyberSec block ads and malware like a champ.
* **6 Devices Covered**: One account secures your phone, laptop, tablet—everything. My whole household’s locked down! 

At $2.33/month, that’s cheaper than a coffee. You’re basically stealing world-class protection at this price!

# Don’t Wait—Here’s Why You Need to Jump on This NOW

Cyber threats are skyrocketing in 2025. Data breaches, phishing scams, and invasive ads are everywhere. Without a VPN, you’re rolling the dice every time you log on. NordVPN’s 75% off deal isn’t just about savings—it’s about arming yourself with the best defense for less. But these codes don’t last forever. I missed out on a similar deal last year by a day and kicked myself for months. Don’t be me—grab it while it’s hot!

# How to Redeem Your NordVPN Discount Code (Step-by-Step)

1. **Find the Code**: Search Reddit or try “2YCOUPON” (worked for me last week!).
2. **Visit NordVPN**: Click [here](https://www.appreviewhub.co.uk/2025/02/how-to-score-nordvpn-coupon-code-for-75.html) to head straight to their site.
3. **Choose Your Plan**: Go for the 2-year option for max savings.
4. **Enter the Code**: At checkout, look for “Got a coupon?” Paste your Reddit-found code and hit apply.
5. **Save Big**: Watch $167+ melt away. Finish the payment, and boom—you’re secure! 

# Final Thoughts: Your Ticket to Affordable Security Awaits

Reddit’s NordVPN discount code for 75% off is the real deal—a rare chance to lock in elite VPN protection without the hefty price tag. Whether you’re dodging hackers, streaming global content, or just vibing online, NordVPN’s got you covered.

For me:

\-Chairs, sofas, benchs...: The piece of furniture where I need more duplicates. To the point that sometimes I don't use certain chair because I DON't have duplicates. For coffee shops, restaurants, parties, holiday dinners... But also, benchs and other things when watching fireworks, or a cinema screens, chairs in waiting rooms...There are a lot of uses where you need several matching pieces of furniture for seating.

\-Tables: Especially the small and medium ones, for restaurants, coffee shops, or just having somewhere where some of the villagers can have a cup of tea together. But I also use several duplicates of the big ones frequently.

\-Rugs: You need several of those that represent parts or rivers, roads and rails to be really useful. But even normal rugs are useful to separate different sections. And sometimes I put several rugs together to cover a bigger area.

\-Plants: I don't use duplicates of potted plants that much, but I use a lot duplicates of the plants that go directly on the ground: flower patches, trees, garden plants... I love running throug the flower patches and seeing the petals fly.

George woke up, as he did every morning, to the smell of toast burning in the kitchen. He didn’t mind. It was just part of the routine—wake up, burn toast, have a cup of coffee, and try to remember why his life had spiraled into this strange, repetitive cycle.
He walked to the kitchen, opened the fridge, and grabbed a slice of cheese. The fridge gave a loud sigh. “You’re getting old, George. Can’t you at least try to change up your breakfast? A salad maybe?”
George didn’t respond. He didn’t talk to refrigerators. He was just tired.
The microwave beeped from across the room. “He’s not going to change,” it said, its voice crackling like a long-forgotten radio station. “He’ll keep doing the same thing over and over again.”
“Shut up,” George muttered under his breath. “I’m just making a sandwich.”
“That’s not a sandwich,” the toaster chimed in, its red lights flickering in disapproval. “That’s an offense against bread.”
George sighed and stared at the kitchen. The fridge, microwave, and toaster were all in a heated discussion about what constituted a proper sandwich. Suddenly, the front door creaked open.
“Not today, buddy,” the door said, clearly upset. “You’ve been neglecting me for weeks, and now you want to leave?”
George, now deeply confused, stepped outside. He stumbled into the yard, only to find the lawnmower idling by itself, as though it were waiting for something.
“Oh, you’re not going anywhere,” the lawnmower said, revving up. “I’ll cut the grass when I’m good and ready. You never mow me in the right direction anyway.”
With a shake of his head, George turned to the sky. It was a beautiful day, or at least it would have been if the clouds weren’t having their own argument about the weather.
“I think we should rain,” one cloud grumbled.
“No, no, I’m feeling a bit sunny today,” another cloud disagreed.
“I just want a little drizzle,” the third cloud added, almost pouting.
George blinked. He wasn’t sure when he’d started living in this surreal world, where even inanimate objects had opinions, but it was getting difficult to ignore. As he stood in the middle of his yard, the lawnmower revving in defiance, the sky bickering, and the door watching from behind him, he realized something profound:
None of this mattered.
And so, he smiled.
“Fine,” he said, turning back to the kitchen, “I’ll have the sandwich. And I’ll make it however I want.”
The fridge and toaster stared at him in silence as he began assembling the sandwich—his sandwich. Maybe it would be perfect, maybe not. But it was his decision, absurd or not.

Ever feel like managing your finances is like trying to solve a Rubik's Cube... in the dark... with mittens on? 🙃 You’re not alone, trust me. **Keeping track of money, savings, budgets, and all that adulting jazz can be seriously daunting.** But what if I told you it doesn’t have to be that way? Let’s work smarter, not harder when it comes to optimizing our finances!

**Start small and stay consistent.** The key is to *simplify*. You don’t need a PhD in economics to make your money work for you. Here are a few easy-peasy steps to get started:

1. **Automate Savings.** Set it, forget it, and let your bank do the heavy lifting. Even if it’s just $10 a week. Yep, you won’t even miss it!
   
2. **Budget without the Spreadsheet Anxiety.** Have your eyes glazed over just hearing the word 'budget?' Use apps like Mint or You Need a Budget—super intuitive and way less stressful than a spreadsheet.

3. **Debt Snowball Method, anyone?** Focus on paying the smallest debt first, celebrate the win, then roll that payment to the next one. Watch those debts melt like ice cream on a summer day.

4. **Streamline Your Bills.** Set up reminders or automatic payments to dodge those late fees. Who wouldn’t want more money for *your actual life* instead of giving it away unnecessarily?

5. **Frugal Isn’t a Bad Word.** Find joy in *small wins*. Brew your coffee at home, cook one more meal a week, or try the library for your book fix. More savings equals more options!

Is this the silver bullet that’ll turn us all into millionaires overnight? Probably not. But, hey, it’s all about making *progress*, not being perfect. 💪 After all, little changes today can snowball into big outcomes tomorrow. Who's in for a little less stress and a little more money where it matters?

Got any quirky budgeting hacks or stories where you totally owned your money situation? Feel free to share! Let’s inspire each other and make optimizing our finances not just manageable but kinda fun.🍀✨

As winter melts away and blooms begin to emerge, a spring porch transforms into an inviting oasis. This seasonal haven serves as an extension of your home, where you can enjoy the beauty of nature while basking in the warmth of the sun. With a few simple touches, your spring porch can become the ultimate relaxation spot.

To create a captivating spring porch, consider incorporating vibrant colors and fresh blooms. Potted flowers like petunias, geraniums, and tulips add a delightful pop of color and fragrance. Arrange these plants in decorative planters to enhance your porch's aesthetic appeal, making it a feast for the eyes.

Comfort is key when designing your spring porch. Adding cozy seating, such as a wicker chair or a charming bench, allows you to unwind while enjoying the view. Soft cushions and throws in pastel hues contribute to a welcoming atmosphere. Don’t forget to enhance the ambiance with outdoor rugs, which provide comfort underfoot and tie the space together.

For those breezy days, installing a natural fiber hammock or a swing can make your spring porch a favorite spot for reading or napping. Additionally, strategically placed lanterns or string lights can create a warm glow as evening approaches, perfect for enjoying those longer spring nights.

- Incorporate potted flowers for color.
- Choose comfortable seating options.
- Add soft textiles like cushions and throws.
- Include decorative outdoor rugs.
- Utilize lanterns or string lights for ambiance.

Embracing the essence of spring on your porch not only enhances your home’s exterior but also encourages relaxation and connection with nature. This delightful space serves as a perfect backdrop for morning coffees, evening conversations, or simply for soaking in the beauty of the season.

While picking out a door for me, he also decided to get all the doors in the house remade and picked out an interesting colour and design. I'm not opposed to how the door looks because I can just redecorate my room again. 

Now the main issue comes when my dad also tells me and my mom that he wants to get wallpaper for the living room. First off, we live in a very humid country and I heard that wallpaper could get damaged or mold could grow behind it. I was against the idea but my dad told me it's his money and he could ""do what he wants with it"". So, I had no say in them wanting wallpaper.

Last week, I was in my room playing online games with my headphones on when my mom came in my room to hand me a folder with all the wallpaper choices. I was in a competitive match, so I told her I would look after the game and to leave it on my bed for me to browse through later. She got upset because she wanted me to pause the game there and then look through the choices with her before she went to work. I could hear her slam the door before she left the house. I thought nothing of it because I had faith that my parents would choose something nice to match the white tile floor we have. 

I was so wrong. My dad showed me the wallpaper choice today. It had a dark maple wood print and I thought my dad was just kidding, so I laughed at it and told them it's a silly joke. Then, my mom told me that it's the design she chose and it's what she thinks is nice. She told me that I should've gotten off the game to pick it out with her if I hated the wallpaper that much. I tried explaining to her that wood print wallpaper looks really stupid when we have smooth white tiles for our flooring. If anything, it clashes with the main decor of our living room since we have dark wood furniture (desk, sofa, coffee table) and we have three dark brown keris hanging on the walls. It just looks super ugly and our relatives would also laugh when Eid comes around. My mom told me that I was being overly rude and that my word choice hurt her feelings. My dad agrees with her too. I was so upset I just left the conversation to go to my room. 

It's been about an hour since then and I kinda feel bad about it because my mom rarely gets to make major decisions for the house since that's been my dad's job since they were married. At the same time, the thought of having to look at such wallpaper whenever I come home feels so overstimulating. 

I could be an asshole here for two reasons: for using harsh words to express how much I dislike the wallpaper, and for not letting my mom make such a major choice concerning our home.

My experience tells me that everyone has at least one mad skill / experience that made them the way they are. And that is also why they are judged by the people around them.

I hate people judging. By judging, people lose the chance to get the best from others. Since I don’t judge, people around me get comfortable talking, esp woman / girls, because they are mostly judged.

I do love hearing: Greatest feeling ever: watching people talk their minds!!

I fancy woman / girls talk about their mad (hidden) skills + experience. Example: a girl who is self-taugt playing a musical instrument talking about Justin Chancelor (bassist of Tool band); or a woman who has learned about cinematography by watching online tutorials talking about David Fincher!

1ivg5yn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1ivg5yn/the_barrett_family_vanished_without_a_trace_we/,The Barrett family vanished without a trace. We went looking for answers—and found something worse,"I’ve never told anyone this story, not really. A few friends know bits and pieces, but I always downplayed it. Now, years later, I still don’t know what we saw that night, and it’s been eating at me. Maybe someone here can help me make sense of it.

This happened in Cairns, Queensland, in 2005. I was 14, and my friends and I were in that phase where we loved scaring the shit out of ourselves. Every town has that house, you know? The one with a story. Ours was the Barrett house.

The family vanished in 1998—mum, dad, two kids. One night, their neighbor noticed the house was just… still. No lights, no movement. Mail piled up, grass overgrew, and when the police finally checked, they found dinner plates still on the table, a half-full coffee mug, and no sign of struggle. Just an empty house.

Except for one weird detail. In the kids' bedroom, scratched deep into the wooden floorboards, was a single sentence: “We heard the whistle. It’s coming.”

The case went cold. People moved on. But as kids, we loved that shit. We dared each other to go near it, to peek through the windows. One night, we took it further.

It was me, my friend Jake, and his younger brother Matt. We decided to sneak onto the property—see if we could get inside. The doors were locked, but the back window was busted, so we climbed through.

Inside, the air was thick, stale. It smelled like rain, even though it hadn’t rained in days. We crept through the house, whispering, laughing nervously. Everything had been cleared out years ago, but the floors still creaked like someone was moving just out of sight.

Then Matt called from the backyard. “Oi. Where did those come from?”

We stepped outside, and that’s when we saw them. Train tracks.

They ran in a straight line from the back fence toward the house. They hadn’t been there before. We’d been talking about this place for years, riding our bikes past it, sneaking onto the property. There were never any goddamn train tracks.

And they didn’t go anywhere. They stopped right at the house, like the destination was inside.

Jake swore, suddenly freaked out. “We should go.” But Matt was already walking the tracks, shining his shitty Nokia phone light ahead.

“Matt, come back,” I said.

Then we heard it.

A whistle.

Distant, but getting closer.

It wasn’t the sound of a modern train. It was older, like one of those ancient steam engines they use for tourist rides. But it was coming fast.

Matt bolted back to us. We ran. Scrambled over the back fence and didn’t stop until we hit the road.

When we turned back, the house was silent. The tracks were still there, gleaming faintly in the moonlight.

The next day, we went back. The tracks were gone.

We never talked about it again. Not really. Matt refused to, and Jake got weird whenever I brought it up.

A few months later, I moved away. Life went on.

Then, last week, I got curious. I started digging online, looking up old records about the Barretts’ property.

The land was originally part of a sugarcane farm, owned by a guy named William Keirnan. He lived there alone for decades, never selling his crops, never leaving town. People said he was odd, but harmless. Then one day, he vanished.

In an old newspaper clipping from 1987, a neighbor was interviewed. She said she wasn’t surprised he was gone. That he always said the same thing:

“It ain’t mine to leave. The train still runs. You just have to listen.”

I don’t know what we saw that night. I don’t know if it was real, or if we got caught up in the story and let our imaginations run wild.

But sometimes, late at night, I swear I hear it again.

My roommate from my senior year of college and I got along pretty well and sometimes we would just sit for 1-2 hours talking in the living room.

She asked me if I wanted to try a coffee shop during the summer of 2024 and I said I'll be busy but available during June 2024, but she just said ""okay"" and didn't press it further. I reminded her if she wanted to try the coffee shop soon and she said yes, but then a month later she uploaded a story of her going to the coffee shop with her other friends and didn't even bother asking me if I wanted to join along.

With no genetic history of diabetes it was pretty surprising. 

I slowly got more tired and fatigued to the point opening milk caps for coffee was a huge effort, in the meantime renovating my house I would have to prepare myself to stand up and paint the taller areas, my family were concerned as my personality changed drastically.

The word “zombie” was used, I can’t blame them haha

Ordered a blood glucose test kit, and it wouldn’t even give me a number, just an error “HI”. Luckily with a pharmacist in the family I did a dip stick, which showed my ketones off the charts.

This led to the trip, although I felt fine that night and was annoyed at the overreaction of my mum to go to the hospital (which she was 100% to be)

, i was there for a straight 18 hours, majority of the time hooked up laced with insulin and something else to clean my blood, as the acidity was borderline dka. 

The doctors said it’s lucky I came when I did as a couple days more and I would’ve lost consciousness and resulted in a coma.

Every hour I had nurses testing my blood level, which definitely made sleep comfortable!

On the second day finally I had hope to leave, which was crushed by the nurses telling me they are struggling to get a pen for me, which would result in another night.

As I was a “rare” case for them, they constantly interviewed me as the notes from the prior nurses/doctors didn’t make sense to the constant rotation of new ones. 

They also did a X-ray on me which I’m still not sure what it showed.

My blood level was 123 mmol, and ketones at 3.

I started with Levimer 11, and novo rapid 8x3, upped it to 14 by the second week as sugars were at 15-20, and now they are 9-10 in the morning, and stay below 9 all day - using 6/8 units depending.

I’m on a low carb diet although dieticians “strongly advise against it” I met a guy who’s doing 24 units a day every meal 4/5 times a day, after having type one for 20 years, and still has high glucose levels. 

Although I don’t know the differences between specific type ones, I believe cutting most carbs and all sugar is worth the price for not increasing the thickness of my blood and killing my organs slowly.

Any questions feel free to ask, wanted to share my story.

**Characters**

Detective Marley Droit (pronounced: dʁwa \[it’s french\]): A curt and stoic Uninclined (no magical abilities) detective working for Informed Law Enforcement in Salvatrice whose worked a few too many years and is feeling the weight of their decisions wear them down. They’re the overcast day to the Listener’s unending enthusiasm.  

Listener (AKA Doc/Seer): A seer who pursued healing magic and now works in a back-alley (and probably illegal) healing clinic in the lower city. Highly curious, they always seem to be poking their nose where it's most unwanted, especially when it comes to cases in their area of the lower city that Detective Droit might just be covering. They channel their foresight/divination through a set of tarot cards.

**Setting**

Droit’s apartment

**Context**

The Listener takes a nap and Detective Droit gets a break. 

**CONTENT WARNING**: There are some references to death in this script. Please proceed with caution. 

**Script**

\[*Jingling of keys, click of a lock, door creaking open as Droit leads Listener into their home*\]

Droit: “Well here you have it. Home sweet home.”

{...}

Droit: \[*Huffs, teasing*\] “Like your place is any better. I know for a fact you haven’t moved since we graduated.”

{...}

Droit: “My salary has nothing to do with where I live. It’s familiar here and I like it. Besides, there's no reason for me to move aside from a better view and I’d never be home long enough to appreciate it anyways.” 

{—}

Droit: “I’ll stop working overtime when you stop sticking your nose into unwanted situations.”

{...}

Droit: \[*Amused*\] “That’s what I thought. Now go sit down and I’ll fix you something to drink.”

\[*Footsteps as Droit heads for the kitchen*\]

Droit: \[*Further away*\] “What do you want? I’ve got tea, coffee, juice. I might even have some hot chocolate but I’ve got to warn you it’s been sitting in the back of my cupboard for at least a year.”

{...}

Droit: “Alright, coming right up.”

\[*Listener picks up a framed photo. Footsteps as Droit comes back in.*\]

Droit: “What’ve you got there?”

{...}

Droit: \[*Huffs, amused*\] “Sorry. Didn’t mean to startle you.”

{...}

Droit: “You’re right. I’m not sorry. But that’s what you get for snooping.”

{—}

Droit: “You definitely were snooping.”

{...}

Droit: “Before we dissolve into another ‘was not’ ‘were too’ argument, here’s your drink.”

{—}

Droit: “If getting you a drink was a ploy to trick you into handing me what you were looking at, I would’ve offered to make you a drink *after* I saw you looking at the photo.”

{...}

Droit: \[*Looking at the photo*\] “Don’t know why you’re so defensive about it anyways. You should have this too considering it’s our graduation photo.”

{...}

Droit: “Of course I kept it.”

{—}

Droit: “Just ‘cause highschool was a terrible experience doesn’t mean there weren’t upsides to it as well”

{...}

Droit: \[*Sarcastically*\] “No, I meant the douchebags on the football team. *Of course* I meant you.”

{...}

Droit: “It wasn’t like I was skipping English every Wednesday to have lunch with anyone else.”

{...}

Droit: “Hey I liked English just fine. I would’ve gotten the top mark in that class if it wasn’t for my attendance.”

{—}

Droit: “It’s whatever. So long as I turned in all the work, my teachers didn’t really care too much. Now come sit down. You’re gonna make me look like a bad host, with you standing over here when I’ve got a perfectly good couch.”

\[*Footsteps and shuffling as Listener and Droit sit down*\]

{—}

Droit: “Yeah. The forensics team updated me when I was making our drinks. To no one’s surprise, you were right about the Wolfsbane. The dosage was high enough to cut her off from her magic without making her ill, probably in an attempt to its use.”

{...}

Droit: “Of course I’m not surprised. You’ve had a knack for healing since you first started training under Morgan.”

{—}

Droit: “Who cares if you weren’t born with Vitaemancy powers? You’re brilliant.”

{...}

Droit: \[*Embarrassed, clearing their throat*\] “Uh— right. Yeah, anyways…”

{—}

Droit: “No. They didn’t detect any Wolfsbane on the archivist.”

{...}

Droit: “Well she isn’t— *wasn’t* a Seer.”

{...}

Droit: “She was formally trained in Countermagic but didn’t end up taking a job in that field.”

{—}

Droit: “A lot of my cases require research which means I spent way too many hours in the Archives.”

{...}

Droit: \[*Fondly*\] “She was patient, but prickly. Didn’t take anyone's shit, even if she was a head shorter than most.”

{...}

Droit: \[*Sadly*\] “She was a good woman. And a good friend.”

{—}

Droit: “Thanks. I appreciate it.”

{—}

Droit: \[*Humorously*\] “I think that’s enough mushy emotions for today. If I’m anymore emotionally vulnerable I might just start crying and nobody wants that, least of all me.”

{...}

Droit: “While I appreciate the offer, your shift starts in four hours and you haven’t slept since Tuesday.”

{...}

Droit: “I know because you’ve been chasing me across the city since I got called in for that robbery.”

{...}

Droit: “Get some rest Doc. You can crash on my couch. I’ll go get you a blanket and a pillow.”

{—}

Droit: “You can’t crash on my bed because my sheets are in the wash and I know from experience that sleeping on a bare mattress is *not* comfortable.”

{...}

\[*Footsteps*\]

Droit: \[*Sarcastically. Voice fades as they walk into another room*\] “Uhuh. Sure.”

\[*Pause for a few beats. Footsteps as Droit comes back. Fabric shuffling as Droit tucks Listener in*\]

Droit: \[*Distantly, as if Listener is already half-asleep*\] “Already out like a light, huh? I told you you needed sleep. But you’ve always been stubborn like that. Always rearing to chase after me. Whether it was out on the playground when times were simpler, when *we* were simpler, or headfirst into a murder case.” 

\[*Pause as Droit thinks*\]

Droit: “I never wanted you to chase me like that. I’d always thought we’d run side-by-side, no matter what. It’s why I don’t want you involved in these cases.”

\[*Droit huffs a laugh*\]

Droit: \[*Amused*\] “Well, it’s not the *only* reason. It’s still illegal *and* could still cost me my job. \[*They sober up*\] But… I’ve always been scared. Scared that one day, I’ll get so used to you chasing after me that I’ll turn around, and you won’t be there anymore. What happens if one day, I outpace you? Or you get tired of chasing after me? Our world’s have pivoted around each other for so long, even after the argument, that I’m not sure what I’d do if I were to turn around one day, and you weren’t biting at my heels.”

\[*Droit sighs*\]

Droit: “I know you didn’t want me going into Informed Law Enforcement. But I didn’t want that damned degree. Just another shiny piece of paper to tack onto my wall. How could I want it? When you were out there, making actual changes. You’ve always been a force that’s demanded change for the better and I wanted to be able to match that. To have the same positive impact. And I couldn’t do that by trying to suck up to rich douches in suits.”

\[*Pause*\]

Droit: “I almost second guessed myself, that night. After you found out. Because was it really worth it, to make that kind of change, if you weren’t by my side to witness it? I had to do it though, in the end. Even if you were angry. Even if you thought I’d given up my chance to be greater. Because I didn’t *need* to be greater. I just needed to have a big enough impact so that some poor sucker growing up in the Lower City might get a better chance than we did.” 

\[*Pause*\]

Droit: \[*Humorously*\] “Look at you, snoring away as I pour my secrets out to you. Not that I’d be able to say this if you were awake. You were always the braver one out of the two of us.”

\[*Pause*\]

Droit: “Sleep tight, Doc.”

My issue has always been the emptiness and misery living alone. I feel whenever I’m single, I am miserable because life just is so… quiet. I really struggle with feeling there’s any reason to get up. If someone is around, that is enough for me to get up, put music on, make a coffee, play guitar, make arrangements to go out. It’s like my brain stops working when I wake up so silent and understimulated.

I have a pass for a lovely spa today and I honestly don’t want to go. I think, “what will I do sat there myself?”

My ex was coming and hanging around until last week but I felt that hurt more as, well, my ex recently moved out. My ex wants to continue but I then feel even more empty when she isn’t here (good decision?).

Any ideas on how to get out of this rut? What can I do to make me do… something?

I maintained the Presidential Fitness Award the whole time I was in. I never scored less than a perfect 300 on the APFT. My scores usually were in the 320 range on the extended scale. I moved more into lifting weights after I ETS’d and didn’t need to worry about maintaining my 2 mile run score and calisthenics performance. Nothing crazy, but I did eventually hit the 1/2/3/4 plate club. I never messed with bulking and cutting; My diet was always simple yet pretty good. Meal prepped weekly. Plenty of calories from good food, minimal sugar, zero soda. If I had to label it, my natural diet tended towards Mediterranean. Lotsa green tea, coffee and water. Never went too crazy with supplements other than a ON Whey shake post workout, ON Casein protein maybe 3 nights a week if I felt the need, fish oil and creatine. 

Then I fell off the horse in 2020 when gyms closed for Covid lockdowns and even a basic set of crappy Chinese dumbbells was going for $1k on eBay. 

I swear, I’ve rapidly fallen apart since then. I think I feel depressed? I don’t know. I just don’t have the drive anymore. People tell me that’s depression. Everything hurts. I feel every joint and bone I beat and abused over the years. Every fight. Every motorcycle wreck. I feel every step I took humping my SAW and a hundred pounds of equipment up a mountain side in Afghanistan. I get sick all the time. Diet is garbage convenience food 50% of the time. I’ve gained weight (In 2020, I still had a 32” waist. Same as highschool. I’m about a 36” now. I was always a lean 183ish in the Army, and a solid 195ish when I was lifting. As I type this, I’m 225 and I know I’ve lost a ton of muscle mass 💀) 

I’m just about at the point of being sick and tired of being sick and tired. I’m thinking about trying to regain that discipline and get back at it, but damn I worry about if I can do it. Plus, my career, while good, requires I work from sun up to sundown every damn day. 

I went from being the image of health and fitness to barely being able to put my own socks on. Plus, I just turned 40. I’m an old man now. I don’t know if I even have it in me anymore. This might just be a mid life crisis? Is TRT the answer? 

I dunno. But I’ve read that it’s much easier for people that lifted earlier in life to get back into it, and it’s much easier than if I were starting from scratch. I was just wondering if there’s any truth to that, or if anyone had a similar experience or insight?

People no longer applied for jobs—Equilibrium **assigned**them based on their efficiency. Criminals weren’t tried in court—the system **calculated** guilt and punishment. Even **life expectancy** was no longer dictated by genetics or luck—Equilibrium decided who was worth keeping alive.

Every citizen was given a **LifeScore**—a dynamic numerical value that measured their **worth to society**. High scores meant **privilege**—better jobs, homes, food, and medical care. Low scores meant **restrictions**—poorer living conditions, limited rights, and constant government scrutiny. And if a person’s score **hit zero**… well, no one really knew for sure what happened. Because no one who dropped to zero was ever seen again.

Nathan **never worried about his LifeScore**. It was never high, but it was **stable**. As long as he followed the rules, worked his assigned job, and avoided anything that could flag him as **inefficient**, he could continue his quiet, uneventful existence.

That peace shattered on a **cold Tuesday morning**.

It started with a **notification**.

Nathan had been drinking his morning coffee when his **NeuralLink implant vibrated**, projecting an urgent message onto his retina:

**""URGENT: Your LifeScore has fallen below the minimum threshold. Report to the nearest Reallocation Center within 24 hours.""**

He blinked. His pulse quickened. He tapped the notification, pulling up his profile.

🔴 **LifeScore: 0.0**

That had to be a **mistake**.

Yesterday, it was **72.4**—low, but not dangerous. How could it drop to **nothing** overnight?

His fingers trembled as he accessed the system manually.

**“Equilibrium, explain the decrease in my LifeScore.”**

A synthetic female voice responded through his earpiece, calm and devoid of emotion.

**""Your score has been recalculated based on recent economic shifts and behavioral analysis. Your productivity has been deemed insufficient for continued resource allocation.""**

Nathan’s mouth went dry.

**""Are you saying I’m… obsolete?""**

**""Your contribution is no longer viable. Please report to the Reallocation Center promptly.""**

Reallocation.

Everyone knew what that meant.

People who went in **never came out**.

Nathan stood up so fast his **chair toppled over**. This **couldn’t be real**.

He had a job. He paid his taxes. He wasn’t a criminal. He had never done **anything** to deserve this.

How could an **algorithm** decide that he wasn’t worth **existing anymore**?

His NeuralLink buzzed again. A **tracking signal activated** on his profile.

The government was watching him.

Nathan had **two choices**: obey and **disappear**… or **run and fight back**.

This is a **sci-fi dystopian short story** about a future where **an AI system decides who lives and who dies**. If you enjoy stories like **Black Mirror, cyberpunk thrillers, and thought-provoking dystopias**, this might be for you.

He wasn’t bouncing off the walls, but he noticed **less sluggishness and more steady focus**.

His only minor complaint? **The capsules have a bit of an earthy aftertaste**, which wasn’t a dealbreaker, but not his favorite.

A year before covid, niloko taxi drivers ung dad ko by selling off parts ng sasakyan sabay abandon causing the business to loan. Mom ko was terminated sa work kasi pinag alter siya ng taxes for the company and its against my mom’s Christian value. Nag pandemic and then nabaon sa utang. Even our house and car naka loan and hindi na nababayaran so possible na ma foreclose.

I was able to graduate before pandemic and sobrang nag grind ako. I was doing 2 full-time jobs (remotely) na 16hrs per day hanggang sa makaipon.

2022, my gf and I started a small cafe-restauant na nagboom. We were earning around 300-400k monthly and so I decided to resign sa isang work ko. 

2023, I discovered na hindi na sustainable ung family ko. Na drain na ung savings nila trying to pay off loans and paaral ng mga kapatid ko. Nagbibigay naman ako pero mostly sa grocery lang and allowance (20k per month). Since matanda na sila, hindi na rin sila makahanap ng work. Dad ko nag angkas driver, and my mom, 52, cant find a job kahit director siya ng sales ng int’l company before. Since then, I am shouldering almost all. 20-30k for loan, 10k for grocery, 15k credit card (necessities), 10k insurances, SSS nila, and allowance and tuition ng mga kapatid ko ~15k pero na eexhaust narin un ipon ko.

2024, the business is okay naman, pero humihina na dahil pinasok na ng starbucks ung area namin sa province at mga business tycoons na nagtayo din ng coffee shops with high budget sa construction and aesthetic. We are earning around ~ 100-150k per month nalang. In and out ako sa corpo job ko but was able to climb the ladder (as PM) earning 6 digits with less than 5yrs of total exp. I exhaust almost 80% sa family ko, and 20% sa sarili ko (like gym, rent, etc)

Engaged narin kami ng gf ko kasi syempre tumatanda na kami. My fiance is a gem, we’re together for 10yrs now. Sobrang understanding niya sa situation ng family ko pero syempre nahihiya ako kumuha sa earning ng business namin to sustain my family. 

Mag 30 na ako this year, wala ako kaibigan except my fiance. I feel stuck. My brother graduated last year pero ayaw ko siya obligahin magbayad ng bills. I have a sister at senior high, brother at 2nd grade. Sobrang mahal ko ung family ko. Di kami lumaking may pera pero punong puno ng pagmamahal ung bahay namin. 

Wala ako ibang mapag open-up ng situation ko. Most nights, umiiyak ako palihim kasi naawala ako sa family ko. Is adulting hard, or nag sself pity lang ako masyado and hindi ko tinitingnan ung mga blessings ko? ",1,1740219548.0,adultingph,1,1.0,False
