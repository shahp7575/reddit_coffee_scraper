1nmq8hw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1nmq8hw/i_hate_her_dog/,I hate her dog.,"My girlfriend’s dog has ruined our relationship.

“Hey, can I ask you something?”

I took a deep breath and set the knife down. “Can we do this later? I haven’t eaten all day.” 

My girlfriend, Vanessa, was glaring at me. Her foot tapped against the floor, and I could see she was trying her best not to lash out. As if he sensed the tension growing in the room, that damn dog of hers lumbered into the kitchen.

“Fine,” she said. “I just want to know why you couldn’t feed Harry? I know you’re busy but come on Eli. He was *starving*.”

I rubbed the bridge of my nose and looked away. “Alright alright. Sorry. I got called into work and forgot.” I tried to smile but it came off as more of a spasm of my lips. “I’ll buy him a bone or something to make up for it.” 

Vanessa grabbed Harry’s leash. “This isn’t the first time though.” Little tears dripped down her face onto the floor. Harry whined and nuzzled his wide head against her shoulder. “He means a lot to me. Taking care of him is taking care of me…okay?” 

I clenched my jaw so tight it felt like my teeth might crack. “You got it,” I said. 

After I heard the door close I waited a few minutes before finally allowing myself to relax. I finished cutting up my chicken patty then threw the cubes onto a bed of white rice. I thought, did she really not make anything for dinner because I didn’t feed Harry? I shook my head and walked into the living room. 

I tried to lose myself in a true crime documentary about some people that went missing at a carnival a few decades ago, but I kept looking at the pictures scattered across the room instead. Pictures of Vanessa and her deceased husband, Oscar. 

I knew it shouldn’t bother me that she kept those pictures. We had only been together for two years after all, whereas she and Oscar had been high school sweethearts who married shortly after graduation and were together for nearly twelve years. 

It hurt though. It was obvious she still loved him. The fucking dog was proof of that. Apparently he had been a gift to her from Oscar on his death bed. A ‘living’ testament to their love. 

I snorted and opened another can of beer. The so-called ‘testament to their love’ dug holes in the backyard every other day which I had to fix, shit on the floors, and chewed up my best pair of dress shoes. 

Believe it or not that was not the worst of it. No. Not by far. The dog behaved like a spiteful step-son. He would put himself between Vanessa and I at night, which she found hilarious. He would scratch and howl at the door whenever we shut it to make love. One time, he even jumped onto me, leaving muddy paw prints all over my dress shirt right before we were going to leave for Valentine’s Day dinner. The ensuing argument which resulted after I cuffed him across the head left me crashing at my brother’s house for a week and Vanessa and I nearly splitting.

Thankfully we didn’t. She was a cool gal and I really did not want to go back to living in an apartment on the south side. I never thought I would live in a house as nice as this one and some dog wasn’t going to push me out that easily. 

I laughed at the ridiculousness of it all. I wasn’t even second place in my girlfriend’s life. I was third.

I drifted off into an irritable state that was half sleep and half dim awareness. Faintly, as if from far away, I heard Vanessa scolding me. Closer, ever closer, I felt something thick and wet move back and forth between my fingers. I snapped awake, my heart pounding. I was alone and the TV was off. A nightmare. It was a nightmare. 

Vanessa was asleep in our bed with the dog laying next to her in my spot. He looked up at me and growled softly as I entered the room. “Make room Harry,” Vanessa grumbled. The dog took his sweet ass time to lay down on his doggy bed at our feet. 

The next morning found Vanessa and I going out for some breakfast sandwiches at one of our favorite spots. After some begging and a promise to go shopping with her at Marshall’s later she agreed to leave her dog at home. 

We people-watched and ate and talked about work place drama. I’m a cook and she’s a nurse, so we have *a lot* of material to discuss. Looking back, it was one of the better dates we have had in a long while. No planning went into it. It just happened that way. 

Funny how that works. 

Vanessa crumpled up the sandwich wrapper and sighed. “Ugh, if only these things weren’t eight hundred calories.” 

I snorted. “You’ll be fine.” I patted my belly, which had acquired some extra padding within the last few months. “I should probably lay off the extra calories though.” 

She raised a pencil-thin eyebrow. “You could lay off the beers you know…or at least come out with Harry and I on our runs.” 

“Wouldn’t want to get between you two,” I said glumly. 

Vanessa pursed her lips. 

Oops. 

She leaned forward, her hands folded beneath her chin. “It’s been half a year since you moved in, and you two still haven’t grown on one another. What’s going on?” 

I crossed my arms. “I don’t know…I feel like he hates me because I am not…” 

She rolled her eyes. “Harry is a dog. Let me say it again. He. Is. A. Dog. He doesn’t hate you. But he can sense that you don’t like *him*. That is why I am asking you what’s going on.”

“Nessa he ate my shoes. The ones that belonged to my dad. Somehow singled them out from all the others, like he knew how special they were to me. He gets mad whenever I try to lay down in *our bed*. He —“ 

She waved her hand. “Are you hearing yourself Eli? You’re taking the actions of a *dog* personal. I’m worried about you. Ever since you moved in you started drinking more…you don’t work out like you used to…I am sorry but you are losing yourself.” She reached for my hands, her tone earnest as she took them in her own. “I don’t know if it’s the stress from living in a new space or something at work…” 

Something in me snapped. I yanked my hands away from hers and stood up. “IT IS YOUR FUCKING DOG,” I shouted. I regretted it almost instantly. 

Vanessa leaned back, her eyes wide. The workers stopped what they were doing and looked our way. 
I slowly took my seat, and together we sat there for a bit, not knowing where to take things. An older man walked over and looked at us both. “Ma’am, is everything alright?” he asked. 

A terrible calm settled over her. She slowly picked up the car keys then smiled at the old man. “Yeah, I am okay. Thanks.” 

I tried to talk to her on the way back home, but she was silent. The dog greeted her enthusiastically at the door and growled at me. I briefly entertained a fantasy of kicking him in the side, but let it pass just as quickly. 

She didn’t speak to me much over the next couple of days. I didn’t bother trying to sleep in our room — the living room was my new space. It wasn’t half that bad, had it not been for the reoccurring nightmares it would have been perfect. 

Work kept us on different schedules for the rest of the week, and when Friday came along Vanessa told me she had made last minute plans to go on a weekend trip with some of her girlfriends. I tried to give her a hug bye but she brushed me off. She told me we would talk once she was back, and to make sure I fed and walked her dog. I nodded. 

I watched as she got in the car. My heart sank when I noticed one of her male co-workers was driving. 

I grabbed the dog’s bowl and went into the garage. I scooped up some kibble from the big yellow bag and mixed it together with some leftover beef stew I made. I hoped it would count as some sort of attempt at building a relationship with the dog. 

Maybe Vanessa was right. Harry probably sensed my anger towards him, towards Vanessa. He was only being protective of his owner. I gathered up beer cans from around the house and threw them in the bin outside, feeling pretty down on myself. I had let my jealously get the best of me. Took it out on a poor dog. 

Now I was probably going to lose my girl because of it. 

When I got inside, I saw Harry finishing up the last of his meal. He had licked the bowl clean. “How’d you like it?” I asked. 

He looked up at me and cocked his head. I saw his tail start to wag. “I can make you more if you liked the taste of that.” I shifted from side to side, feeling ashamed. “I owe you more than a few meals.” 

Harry barked. He nudged the bowl with his paw, then barked again. I laughed and held up my hands. “Alright alright. I’ll make some beef stew for us both tonight. But I need to run to the store. Think you can hold down the fort while I’m gone?” 

I went to the local supermarket and strategized how I was going to make things right with Vanessa while I gathered ingredients for dinner. I had some pretty good ideas while there, and when I pulled into the driveway of our home, I realized that it had been some time since I had felt this at ease. 

I whistled, bags of groceries in hand, while walking up to the door. I noticed Harry watching me through a window. He barked and started scratching at the glass. “Hold on, I’m coming,” I said.

I stepped inside and nearly dropped the groceries. “Oh fuck. The HELL YOU STUPID FUCKING —“ 

All one hundred and fifty pounds of Harry crashed into me. I didn’t even have time to yell. Together we landed on the coffee table. It collapsed sending wood and glass all over the carpet. Harry licked me across the face and barked happily. I stared up at him in disbelief. 

He jumped off of me. I breathed in deep lungfuls of air, laying there until I was able to get back up again. 
Outside of some cuts on my arm from the glass, I seemed to be fine. “Harry! Harry!” I shouted. 

I couldn’t find him anywhere in the house. I yanked at my hair and tried to calm myself, then I took a picture of what he had done and sent it to Vanessa. 

In the foyer, laid out perfectly for me to see, was a blanket I had gifted Vanessa last Christmas. It had a collage of some of our happiest moments printed on it. Harry had ripped into it and left a nice pile of crap on top. 

When Vanessa called me, she was in disbelief. She asked if I was sure Harry did it. Did I lock all of the doors before leaving? Was someone playing a prank? 

I nearly hung up on her then and there. Did she think he was some kind of perfect being incapable of making a mistake? Then she asked if I was angry enough at her to do something like that. Which in return I suggested she couldn’t accept her dog was a dick because he was a gift from her dead husband. 

Well that did it. She said we would be going to couple’s therapy and if I didn’t want to I would need to pack my bags and be out of there before she came home. Feeling defeated, I agreed. Then she hung up. 

I made dinner for one and felt some satisfaction at Harry’s cries for my food. I kept him outside that night and didn’t bother refilling his bowl. Knowing that my relationship was probably done for I leaned back in my chair, flipped Harry off, and turned on the TV. 

It was the best night of sleep I had in a while. I dreamt of Vanessa, back when we first got together. Back when she was full of passion for me, and we would lay together for hours. She kissed me passionately, her long hair tickling my mouth, and for a moment it felt as if we were hanging together in space, the only two souls throughout all that cold dark. 

Cold. 

I woke up to the cold. 

The window was wide open. 

I blinked back my fatigue, and saw the first traces of dawn in the sky. I looked out onto the yard, and saw Harry lying motionless. At first I thought he was fine, but when his sides failed to rise, I knew something was wrong. 

“Oh shit. SHIT,” I hissed. I stumbled towards the back door and went outside. I knelt next to him, trying to ignore the wave of emotion that threatened to drown me. I ran my hands along his curly coat, feeling for a pulse or breath or any sign of life. “Harry. Come on Harry. Don’t do this buddy.”

I felt his head and his side. Opened his mouth to check if he swallowed something. My hand stopped at his belly. My stomach sank. Some bit of metal was lodged there. My eyes widened. Did he fall on something? Did someone stab him? 

“Fuck,” I whispered. I went to grab my phone and started to call the vet while I tried to pull aside the curls to better see the metal stuck in his gut. 

My finger and thumb closed around the flat piece of metal. The veterinarian’s assistant answered, but I couldn’t have spoken even if my life depended on it. I was frozen. Every part of me rigid with fear. 

Harry slowly turned his head and stared at me. “Pull the zipper Elijah,” he said quietly. 

A choke? A cry? Some sort of twisted, primal groan of terror forced itself out of me. I willed myself to move faster but I couldn’t. I crawled backwards on my hands and feet, not even able to stand. 

All the while Harry watched me. 

Since then I have been staying at my brother’s. Vanessa has called me multiple times but I have not answered and have not read her texts either. I am too afraid. All of my things are still at her house and I know I can’t avoid this forever. 

I am stuck between two outcomes of going back. Either finding out I have gone insane and hallucinated a talking…thing wearing a dog suit OR. 

Or. 

I don’t even want to write it out. 

If any of you have any suggestions then please, let me know. Take away my accountability.

1nmq6pu,https://i.redd.it/1yxmygdddiqf1.jpeg,Review #39: Amrut Fusion Single Malt Whiskey,"Distillery: Amrut 

ABV: 50% (100 proof)

Age: NAS, though thought to be 4-6 years old

Mash bill: 75% malted Indian barley, 25% peated Scottish barley

Casks: ex-bourbon and new charred oak

Price: $77 (Boston, MA)

Sampling method: neat in a glencairn

Color: 1.5 Auburn, Polished Mahogany 

Nose: Nice smelling single malt, typical fruitiness and vanilla and caramel. No discernible peat on the nose at first. A bit of salinity. It’s mostly orchard fruits and wood. As it sits longer, it does get a touch of peat but it’s very gentle and subtle. 

Palate: Nice gentle peat, enough to be noticeable, but not enough to be dominant. There’s some freshly cracked black pepper on the front half. It’s a very sweet whiskey. Peat is a bit on the ashy side on the back end of the palate. 

Finish: Definitely is a bit dark and brooding, reminding me of milk chocolate plus a coffee stout

Rating: 7/10 This is the best Indian whiskey I’ve had by a long shot. It’s rich, complex, and interesting. 

Value: 3/5 I think at this price point Amrut Fusion holds its own against other quality world whiskeys. This is a quality offering out of India!

Wednesday: Don't be an idiot. This is serious. He's cursed.



House: (snickering) Cursed? Of course. I bet the lab would love to run a witchcraft test on his blood.



Agnes: (distracted) That reminds me... has anyone else noticed how the coffee here tastes like potato water?



Enid: (excitedly) I thought it was just me! Looks like the filter has never been changed.



Wednesday: (glaring at them both) My brother is dying and you're arguing about coffee?



House: No, he's not dying. It just looks like it. I'm betting on lupus. It's always lupus.



Wednesday: (dryly) It's never lupus.



Agnes: Since they mentioned hops, has anyone tried that new craft beer from the little shop near school?



Enid: That has nothing to do with it, Agnes! (looks at House) And you're not helping either!



House: Yes, I am. If it's lupus, I win the bet. If it's a curse, you win the ""best dramatic goth cosplay"" trophy.



Wednesday: If you don't believe me, he'll die.



House: (brings the patient's face closer, examining) Hm... normal pupils, labored breathing, pale skin. If it were a curse, at least he'd have glowing red eyes or smoke coming out of his mouth.



Agnes: (looking at her phone) By the way, does anyone know if it's going to rain today?



Enid: (screaming) You're ignoring me!!!



On impulse, she punches Wednesday's brother in the stomach.



Wednesday's brother: COUGH COUGH COUGH (spits out a huge chicken bone that was stuck in the gut)



House: …It's not lupus.



Wednesday: …Nor a curse.



Enid: (scared) I swear it wasn't on purpose!



Agnes: (seriously, looking at the bone on the floor) So the curse was roast chicken?



House: (slowly applauding) Bravo. We saved a life with gratuitous violence. This hospital should patent that.



Wednesday: (looking at her brother) Maybe the curse is living with you.",1,1758456226.0,wednesdaymemes,0,1.0,False

My boyfriend works at a place she used to hang out at during the day. He let her put all her stuff in the corner, made her coffee, was happy to have her there, etc. Old boss was a massive piece of shit, I mean massive. Treated my boyfriend like dogshit, put hands on him a couple times, treated other staff like shit, treated me like shit, made me cry also multiple times. One day, he found her stuff and wanted it thrown out. My boyfriend was not about it and tried to talk him out of it. Well, one day on his day off, the boss saw her, talked to her, it escalated, and he called the cops. The cops did what cops do and beat the absolute shit out of her and arrested her. Old boss threw her stuff out. My boyfriend wasn't there at the time and felt really bad about it, as did I. It was an absolutely horrible situation that didn't need to happen.

It's been a long time since then. There's a new boss now and he's great. But yesterday, a couple people were vandalizing the place. Maintenance guy saw, asked what they were doing, and they ran off. Wasn't too bad, not much damage, but they left a note. Turns out it was from her, and she blames the old boss and my boyfriend for what happened, even though my boyfriend wasn't there and had nothing to do with it. She also added a P.S. that said ""Stop stalking me at the library"".

Here are some of the features that might help you decide if the game is something you would enjoy:

* Mostly inspired by the Shiren and Torneko entries of the Mystery Dungeon series
* Controller- or Keyboard-only 4-way movement (also has remappable binds)
* A permadeath system similar to the Shiren games where you get to keep your items and not levels when you escape the dungeon but you lose everything when you die. You can also store a limited amount of items in the hub area for later runs
* Light meta progression as increasing inventory slots, learning spells and receiving story progression items is permanent. But there's also a dungeon where you can't take any items inside or use any spells!
* Armor, melee and ranged weapons can be leveled up by usage. Special items and can have randomly generated traits (think Electric Knife, Vampiric Revolver)
* A 90s look and feel that takes you back to that era of gaming
* Runs great on Windows, Linux (native build as the game is developed using Linux) and the Steam Deck. It also has Steam Cloud integration, syncing saves even cross platform!
* The full game also has a suspend feature. Perfect for short sessions like coffee breaks or on the go!

 

The demo I've released earlier this year is also still available if anyone is interested in checking that out before the release. 

If you like what you see, **please  wishlist** the game on Steam, it really helps a lot!

Little about me:

I'm a professional that travels often all across the South and Midwest for both work and my personal hobbies. I'm engineer by training but these days I work in technical sales educating people on my companies product line. Typically I travel once a month to DFW and then each month I go out of state.

These days I have a pretty regimental fitness routine. Start each day with a 2 mile walk with a cup of coffee. Afternoons are resistance training and evenings I either go for a walk around the lake nearby my home or hit the shooting range.

I use to be an avid gamer but cut way back over the last 10 years to spend my free time more active and outdoors. When I lived in Washington state I was an avid backpacker and spent most of my weekends in the mountains of Olympic National Park. These days in Texas my primary outdoor activity is competitive shooting. I train often and compete nationally now.

Politically I am more moderate. I grew up conservative back in Alaska, but as I grow older I see both sides of the line. I tend to make political decisions with what makes common sense and also supports my values, which these days is pretty hard.

My top values are integrity, kindness, compassion, honesty, and determination.

When it comes to family / kids I knew awhile back that fatherhood was never for me and had a vasectomy.

Financially I am very stable and live debt free.

What am I looking for?

Someone who can relate to what I've written above. I am a highly independent and financially stable person that is looking to build a partnership with someone. I don't think life is meant to be experienced alone, its meant to be shared with someone. I'm fine with a long distance relationship since I am very open to moving. With my line of work, I can really be anywhere. Age is also not a factor for me, either younger or older.

it's definitely lifted my mood, i feel much more able to do things in the way of self care and keeping up with household tasks.

but i have had a few brief episodes where i've become extremely angry at minor things and had some very dark, violent thoughts. i haven't acted on them, other than throwing a coffee cup on the ground during an argument (wasn't aiming for the other person, just extreme frustration).

a family member was screaming at me yesterday for something I forgot to do, and while she was screaming, i had thoughts of hitting her to make her stop. i did not act on these, but the thoughts were distressing. my mother then drove me home, high, and i also had thoughts of hitting her which weren't in response to anything she did. 

i have c-ptsd and face triggers quite frequently. my usual response is flight — i will run away from a confrontation. that's what i ended up doing yesterday, left the house with no shoes on and in my PJs. i am not a violent person, have only ever hit out in self defense when somebody was harming me or about to. 

it's worrying me that violence is becoming such a frequent fixture in my mind, and i think it can only be the medication. i'm scared to tell my psych nurse or my psychiatrist because admitting you may be a risk to others gets you locked up in hospital far easier than being a risk to yourself. but I don't want to feel this way.

The Earth Friendly Products All Purpose Spray Cleaner – 22 oz – with a delightful orange scent came into my life when I was desperately in search of a cleaning product that wasn’t just powerful but also safe for my family. Living in a household with pets, kids, and a garden that loves bringing in dirt, I had my doubts if an eco-friendly cleaner could really tackle the mess. I decided to put this product through its paces, and here’s how it worked out.

**Eco-Friendly and Kid-Safe Formula**

What initially piqued my interest about this cleaner is its commitment to environmental safety. Its formula is biodegradable and free from harsh chemicals like ammonia or phosphates. This reassurance made me comfortable using it around my kids and our furry dog, Scout, who has a talent for getting paw prints everywhere. Each time I sprayed this on countertops, food-prep surfaces, or Scout’s muddy paw spots, I appreciated the lack of overpowering chemical smells. The mild orange scent feels refreshing instead of suffocating, striking a good balance between usefulness and safety for my home.

**Ease of Use in Daily Life**

I tried this spray cleaner on just about every surface imaginable—kitchen counters, bathroom fixtures, and even my coffee table. The nozzle is smooth to operate, neither too stiff nor too loose. Just one press mists a fine, even spray that covers a substantial area. What impressed me most was how well it worked on greasy stovetops. Though I wasn’t expecting miracles from an eco-friendly solution, this spray made the post-dinner grimy mess vanish in minutes after minimal scrubbing. I even tried it on a sticky juice spill my toddler made on the hardwood and was relieved to find no residue left behind.

**Highlights**

- Non-toxic and safe for families with kids and pets  
- Biodegradable and better for the environment  
- Effectively cuts through grease and grime on various surfaces  

[See Earth Friendly Products All Purpose Spray Cleaner deals on Amazon now.](https://info.sanue.com/p/b00j5hmpuw/)  

**Does it Meet Tough Cleaning Challenges?**

While it shines on light messes and day-to-day cleaning requirements, I can’t completely vouch for its ability to tackle the really stubborn stuff. I tried it on my bathtub’s soap scum buildup, and it required considerably more scrubbing compared to a heavy-duty cleaner. It managed to clean the area, but not without extra effort on my part. For oven racks or deeply entrenched grime, I’d probably have to supplement this product with a stronger, specialized cleaner.

**Downsides**

- Doesn’t handle extreme buildup or deeply entrenched stains easily  
- May not replace traditional cleaners for industrial-strength needs  

**Competing Products**

Before buying this cleaner, I considered a few others, such as Mrs. Meyer’s Clean Day Multi-Surface Cleaner and Method All-Purpose Cleaner. Both are also eco-conscious brands and fall into the same price range. Mrs. Meyer’s has arguably a broader variety of scents, and its cleaning power on grease-heavy tasks felt slightly more robust. Method, on the other hand, leaves a glossier finish on surfaces but smells a tad artificial compared to this product. What this cleaner has going for it is its less abrasive formula, making it a safer choice if little hands or paws are running around. If a natural, no-nasties product is high on your priority list, this remains a solid contender.

**Worth Every Penny?**

Evaluating its cost against its features, I think it’s a worthwhile purchase, as long as your expectations are realistic. It may not replace caustic chemical cleaners entirely for every job, but the reduced risk to my family’s health outweighs that limitation. Plus, the efficiency it shows in daily cleaning tasks makes it easy to justify its spot in my cleaning arsenal. For anyone who values sustainability and simplicity in their cleaning routine, this spray deserves a try.

1nmpxq4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Edinburgh/comments/1nmpxq4/i_work_in_edinburgh_airport_let_me_make_life/,"I work in Edinburgh Airport, let me make life easier in small ways","I work in Edinburgh airport and I see so many people who are arriving and departing so things the most complicated or most expensive way possible, here is what I've learned while working there that might make your travels easier. Most of these will be Duty Free related but there are some general ones in there.

(Edited to fix Numder 5)

1- If you plan on getting the tram into Edinburgh straight from the airport it will cost you £7.90 (adult), but if you are able to, walk the 15 minutes to Ingliston and get the same tram for £2.20, I'll never understand why it's so inflated just for being at the airport, but personally I think it's a big scam.

2- Fast Track isn't always worth it, during peak times sure it can be worth it, especially if you don't like the congestion of the general security, but depending on the time of day you could get stuck behind and entire cabin crew and half of the other airport employees, I don't have exact times but it's just something I've seen.

3- If you're shopping in the Duty Free and someone asks you to fill in a survey, please just do it, I beg, it may not be making life easier for you but it makes life so much easier for them, and sometimes doing a good thing for a stranger can being you good karma for the rest of the day.

4- Staying with the Duty Free theme, depending on where you are traveling there are some limitations on what you can buy. If you are flying within the UK only you cannot buy alcohol or tobacco, there are LIMITED alcohols you can buy but they are high street prices and you can get it cheaper wherever you land. If you are travelling to the US we cannot sell you Haggis or Kinder Eggs (the haggis i get but Kinder Eggs? Come on America), if you are transferring through a US airport you can't buy alcohol in a bottle that you can't see into, this is because of the security in US airports we don't even really understand why either. If you are travelling to Australia, you can't buy alcohol or anything over 100ml unless you buy it on your final leg into Australia, they've got some crazy customs rules. And if you are travelling to Doha and plan on staying in the country for anything other than a transfer PLEASE don't buy alcohol, you can get charged or arrested, Qatar is a dry country, which I fear is common sense but it's happened before.

5- The parking at the airport is a scam, especially if you use the Long Stay carpark, it cost £55 for a single day of parking, it's probably cheaper to cash out for a taxi, but that's just my opinion. (EDIT- Based on a few comments it seems I'm wrong, this was just based on my own experience, after a single shift my parking would be £55 before staff discount, that's what I based this on, so I'll take the L here and admit I am under researched on this, my bad)

6- There is more than one bathroom in the airport, from what I've seen the bathrooms next to Gate 8/9 are always so full, but if you go round to gate 4 it's basically empty, this is obviously time dependent because when something is taking off from Gate 4 they can get busy, but never as busy as the Gate 8 ones.

7- If you have alot of spare change and you want to get rid of it when you're buying things, please don't get annoyed when the person counting it takes a while, for me it's the best day ever when I get to sort through people's coins, but for others it's hard, you chose this battle just stick it out.

8- Caffe Nero does the best coffee, Pret does the best Breakfast food, Bar Barito is the best for everything else, anywhere else is expensive and just not worth it in my humble opinion.

1nmpwtb,https://i.redd.it/9hcak99uaiqf1.png,"Star City StrongFest, Sept. 27","Before I launch into the event pitch & raffle info, here's a short story: In 2014, I was a Roanoke newbie. A YMCA flyer led me to a small strongman competition at a gym on Shenandoah where I was introduced to our strength community. That single event grew into 10 years of Star City Strongman and eventually [Star City StrongFest,](https://www.starcitystrongfest.com) a free annual festival celebrating strength and community.

Over the years, the strength community here has been more than just lifting. This sport and these people have carried me through some of my hardest days and I’ve seen the same for others. 

At its core, it’s about connection and community. Out of that shared experience, and backed by ten years of data and partnerships, the Star City Strong Foundation was launched this June to expand access to strength sports and advance research on the powerful link between lifting and mental health.

Now, she’s forcing herself into my own reality.","Keeping a diary was something I’ve always done when I was a kid. Maybe the hobby started when my mother gave me my first diary and I was bored at that time. It was solid magenta with a large clasp that kept it closed even when I stuffed it with random drawings I made. At some point, Mom realized the diary and some art supplies kept me occupied and out of trouble when she went out to work her second job at nights. So, she made it a tradition to give me a new diary as a present for my birthdays. And it became my mission to fill them up with entries before the next celebration. The tradition lasted until she passed away just before I graduated high school. But I revived the tradition when I was a sophomore in college, using the money she left for me. 

I’m sorry. You might think I’m jabbering about something trivial. But my diaries and how I started to routinely and unceasingly write in them has a reason behind them. And it’s also the reason why I’ve chosen to write my last entries here on this website. 

Just please, read until the end and remember, there are two things that are certain: my name is Selina and it all started on September 13, 202x. 

——————

September 13, 202x

As I clocked out from the office around 7:30 PM, I remember feeling irate at everything. I was pissed at my coworkers for procrastinating and causing me to do overtime. I got irritated when the 7/11 near my house didn’t have the sandwich I liked. And I nearly broke down when I couldn’t get my heels off my feet at the first second I entered my apartment. 

I remember being tipsy from the beers I bought on a whim. But I don’t recall how many bottles I drank or how I managed to get into my bed. All I knew was that the next time I opened my eyes, there was this ringing sound in my ears. I rubbed my face and felt around for my phone that was usually by my pillow to check the time. I was surprised to see that it was still 11:49 PM since I thought I would sleep until the morning. 

*Well, tomorrow’s the weekend anyway,* I mused. I turned on my bedside lamps, hoisted myself off the bed and started to make my way to the kitchenette. *I should make some coffee and maybe read a book.* 

Then a realization belatedly hit me. 

My lockscreen was different. I was sure it was my mom’s portrait, the one I took during one of her last birthdays but now—

I grabbed my phone off the bed, opened it, and froze. Staring back at me was me and a stranger. 

It was a selfie. In it, another woman smiled and had an arm around me while she held a cake in front of us. It seemed like it was a birthday cake. *My* birthday cake. The frosting said, “Happy Birthday, Seli!”

That woman looked like me. As soon as I thought of that, there was this feeling that crept up. It was like some sense of familiarity or fondness that I shouldn’t be feeling towards this woman. I hastily shook my head, clearing my mind.  

*What the hell? Is this some type of prank?* I thought as I unlocked my phone and swiped through the apps. *Did someone photoshop this or used some type of app or AI? But no one should have access to my phone.* 

Then my fingers stilled. While I was clicking through the apps, I opened the gallery. There, I saw pictures of me in a park with the same woman. She had familiar features that I saw everyday in the mirror: dark hair, brown eyes, and an asymmetrical smile where only 1 side had a dimple. 

It was eerie, to say the least. My mind raced as I scrolled to more photos that shouldn’t exist. There were snaps of a dog in my apartment that I was certain I never saw before. There were mirror selfies in a restaurant I couldn’t recognize. And so many selfies with a woman who looked like me. Like a younger version of mom, or so relatives would say when I briefly visited my hometown after graduating college. 

Locking my phone, I reasoned that this was an elaborate prank by my friends or a random TV show. Or maybe I’m in such a vivid dream caused by my sudden drinking. I tossed my phone back onto the bed and sighed. I closed my eyes and massaged my temples. 

Just as I reopened them with my head down, it dawned on me again. A feeling that something was off, wrong, or out of place. Then I saw that I was standing on a carpet encircling my bed. In *my* room, when I never preferred to have them before. 

Mind whirring again, I looked around and saw more odd things. There was a coat rack with bags and jackets that I didn’t remember owning or using. There were figurines and collectibles of characters I didn’t know. Every turn of my head was a new, or wrong, thing that was stranger to me. Then the same emotion of familiarity that I shook away came rushing back to me. 

“Okay, okay, okay,” I breathed out. “Whoever is pranking me, you can stop now! I don’t see the cameras but I’m sure they’re here.” 

I looked around, waiting for the punchline. But it never came. 

“This isn’t funny, just so you know. I am *not* amused. So, please, stop this joke!”

Silence.

In the silence, I closed my eyes. “So, maybe not a prank and just a really weird dream. Maybe a vivid nightmare…”

I started to breathe deeply to try and calm my nerves. I wished that the next time I opened my eyes, I would be back in my actual room. I prayed that the nightmare would end and that nothing jumps out of the shadows like a jumpscare. 

“Selina?” A voice suddenly called out to me. 

I yelped and immediately lunged forward. Without looking up, I crouched to the floor and started feeling for my handgun under the bed. At the back of my mind, I was screaming for it to exist wherever this is. 

It *was* there. Thanking the gods, I pulled it out and pointed it at the person who I assume broke into my apartment. 

“Whoa, whoa, okay!” The intruder said as they raised their hands and backed up into the dark. “Selina, calm down. It’s me!”

A thud sounded as the intruder’s phone hit the floor. The flashlight was on and it was like a glare messing with my vision.

”Who are you? How did you get in here?!” I questioned loudly. “How do you know my name?”

“Selina, what are you— Oh no.”

I heard a tired sigh. I could vaguely make out the woman lowering their arms and putting their face in their hands. 

“No, no. Oh, Selina. No…” She whined softly. 

The scene unnerved me even more. But I kept the gun pointed at the stranger. My hands were shaking and I slowly inched towards my phone to call the police. 

“W-What are you mumbling about? Tell me where this is and who you are now,” I demanded, trying to feel brave. 

The woman came to attention and I felt her gaze fall to the phone I was reaching my hands to. I panicked and just as I was about to fire, she put her hands up again. 

“I’m not a threat! I know you think something bad is happening right now but I assure you, you’re safe. I am not here to hurt you, just please hear me out.”

I made no reply. My head was screaming that whatever she spouted out was some bullshit. *I feel very unsafe right now, you know?!*

“You don’t have to put the gun down, okay? Just give me a chance, please,” she pleaded. “Please listen to me, Seli.”

I stood still, saying nothing. With the gun in my right hand and now my phone in my left hand’s grasp, I took a few steps towards the windows. My mind started formulating a ridiculous plan of jumping from my second-floor apartment out into the street, away from this lunatic. I would likely break my legs but people would surely notice me and get help. 

While I was thinking of an escape plan, she stepped into my room. With the lights on, I got a good look at her. I gasped. 

It was her. The woman in my pictures. Her hair was messy, and her eyes widened in concern. But it was unmistakeable, she was that woman. 

My movements stopped and I stared at her. She inched closer with her arms still up. 

“It’s me, Selina. It’s me, your sister, Casey. You recognize me, don’t you?”

*Lies*, a voice interjected in my head. I woke up from my stupor and realigned the gun. “What fucking nonsense are you saying right now?”

She paused and lifted her arms higher. “I’m your sister, Selina. For God’s sake, just look at me closely.”

”I *don’t* know who you are!” *Or whatever the fuck’s going on right now!*

Tears started rolling down her eyes. That completely caught me off guard. 

“Fuck,” she whispered. “Is it happening again? Are you sick again?”

*What.* My hands were uncontrollably shaking. From confusion or fear, I did not know. All I knew was that I needed to leave this situation or just wake up from this nightmare. 

“Listen, Seli. I’m Casey. You might not recognize me, but I’m your older sister and I take care of you.”

She clasped her hands as if in prayer. 

“I would never hurt you. Never. Please put the gun down and join me in the living room. I’ll explain everything, I promise.”

She stepped backwards and slowly exited the room. I could hear her moving around in my apartment. The sounds of her soft footfalls were mixed with clinking sounds and bags being opened. 

I stood there, silent and confused as ever. I lowered the gun but I didn’t let go of it. In fact, I checked if it was still loaded. Then I contemplated whether or not I should call the police. 

She was not an immediate threat. She left the room and I could just jump or run out before she could even realize I even moved from where I was standing. I could scream so loud, the neighbors would have to call the police. 

*Leave now,* echoed the same voice in my head from earlier. A low ringing in my ears was thrumming.

But a nagging feeling slowly started to overwhelm me. An unwelcome one. Then in an instance, my focus on escaping or shooting my so-called sister vanished. Like it was never there. 

Before I could concentrate on what was going on in my mind, my sister called out to me, “Selina?”

‘Casey’ reappeared at the doorway, with mugs in her hand. “I made some hot chocolate, your favorite.”

I couldn’t see it. But I must’ve had a blank look on my face as I answered, “Um, sure.”

She smiled warily and went back into the living room.

Minutes later, I was curled up on the couch with a mug of hot chocolate in my hands. My gun and phone were on my lap. While my initial hostility had gone down considerably, I was still nervous of her. 

She sat on a small stool across from me, another item I know I never owned. I didn’t know I was eyeing her so intently until she coughed. I looked away and shifted into my seat in a futile attempt to distance myself from her.

“Well, where should I begin,” she nervously said and licked her lips. “My name’s Casey. I am 3 years older than you. We didn’t grow up together because Dad took me with him when he and Mom divorced back when we were still kids. We did not have much contact until Mom died and we met during your senior year of high school.”

”Stop,” I interrupted. “Now I know you’re lying, Dad died when I was still a baby—“

She put her hand up in protest. “I know. I *understand*.”

She sighed and hung her head low. 

“That’s the same thing you told me when we met face-to-face during Mom’s funeral. You kept denying Dad’s and my existence. You insisted we were scammers trying to steal Mom’s life insurance.”

She continued with her story. Apparently, I had a mental breakdown when I found Mom's corpse and that I was acting out of sorts in the psych hold until one day I “snapped back into reality”. Casey said that I arranged the funeral perfectly, listened properly to the doctors, and acted “back to normal”. I ended up convincing myself and everyone else that it was just shock and the horror of the situation that unsettled me for a while. 

She told me that I confronted them and told funeral goers that they weren't my family. Casey then looked into my eyes and asserted that that was impossible. We might not have bonded like normal families do but we had contact and were aware of each other. Then they ascertained that the trauma may have affected me more than the doctors thought. I was then sent to a psychiatrist in the city where my Dad and Casey lived. 

“Dad was told that you were having false memories due to trauma and that therapy could help you,” she said as she sipped from her mug. “After a few months, it started to work. You started to recognize me and Dad, and little by little remembered the real past.”

“But…?” I tested. I knew there was a “but” coming up.

She then started sobbing again, “You began to turn into someone else. The person who didn’t know who we were. One day I came home early to take care of you cause you had a fever, and you jumped me at the door. You pointed a knife at me. And you kept asking me why we were holding you hostage and where Mom was.”

Her sobs echoed throughout the apartment. After a few moments, she sniffled and looked back at me. “Dad came home in time. After that, there were visits to psychiatrists and specialists that you are better off not remembering. Since then, you would once or twice a year wake up with different false memories. To help you, we had you keep a journal whenever you were back to your original self to keep tabs on your daily life, your work, and your relationships.”

Up until this point, I was quiet. I didn’t interrupt anymore after the first time. Then when she mentioned a journal, I sprung up from the couch. 

That’s right! My diaries. They would be proof of what’s actually real. I never really mentioned them to anyone or in anything, even when asked if I had a habit of journalling or diary keeping. To me, they were parts of me that I put into writing and treasured close to my heart. 

I ran back into my room, ignoring Casey as she followed me in. Setting the phone and gun within reach, I took my cow plushie from a small pile near my pillow. Flipping it around, I found the hidden zipper and fished out my diary. It was the latest one in my collection: a black, small, leather-bound journal.

To this, Casey peculiarly gasped like it was a surprise. I caught her muttering something under her breath, “So that’s where you keep it.”

”What?” I swiveled around and pointedly stared at her. “You mean you never saw me write in this before?”

She shook her head. 

“No, you loved it so much that the moment you got it, you kept it away from us. But everytime I’d mention it and you’d read it, it would calm you down.”

I did not know if I believed her explanation. How can they be so sure that the contents of a journal I guarded so much would help me with my supposed mental illness? I didn’t buy her story from the very beginning anyway but this just makes it more suspicious. 

I turned away from her and ran my fingers across the pages and the edge of the diary. I confirmed it was the one I owned. *Thank God*. Then, remembering I had a “watcher”, I smiled and shooed Casey away. 

“Could you leave me alone for a while? It’s kinda uncomfortable with you standing there,” I requested. 

She tensed up but ultimately relented. Casey briskly left and closed the door behind her. 

I kept my eye on the door for a long moment. 

The life I know I lived is real. My experiences and memories aren’t false. My parents were poor immigrants who came to the US when I was still a newborn. Dad died when I was a toddler, and soon after his death, Mom got two jobs to support ourselves. She was doing work as a nurse and a grocery store employee just so she could send me to school, pay rent, and save up for my college education. She never told me, but Dad actually left debt for our family and it was the primary reason why Mom overworked herself to death. I only discovered it after seeing the papers in Mom’s things. 

After Mom’s passing, I used the money from her life insurance and the money she saved up for me to enroll in college and move into the school dorms. I only bought food and other necessities with salaries from my part time jobs. Then I graduated and got a job soon after in a textile company. I moved into a small one-room apartment, which I slowly but surely filled with furniture over the years. 

I’ve only ever had 2 boyfriends and they were during high school. I’ve gone on dates but none really stuck around enough for me to commit. I keep in touch with my maternal cousins who came to the US for studies and go out with friends from college every other month. I have an amicable relationship with my coworkers but I don’t go to dinners with them. It’s sort of a general consensus that I don’t have many relationships with other people in my personal life. And that makes it easy for me to remember everyone I’ve had even a semblance of a conversation.

So, there is no way I could ever miss a formerly estranged sister from who knows where. 

I never had a sister. Never even had a best friend to consider a sister.

All of those experiences are real and I wrote so many details about them in my diaries that they are a testament to my life, my *real* life. 

*Right. This must all be an elaborate prank or a convoluted nightmare*. Suddenly, my original plan of escaping ignited once more, but now with my diary in hand. 

Before anything else, I collected the gun, diary, and my phone and weighed my options. But before I could stand up from the bed, the ringing in my ears rose to a higher pitch. I groaned and crumpled to the floor. 

*Do not resist,* a voice reassured in my head. I strangely trusted those words. 

I rested my head on the floor and let the ringing go on. And before the pain got too much to bear, I was knocked out. 

The last thing I saw was my “sister” ran in the room. 

“Selina!”

——————

The next thing I knew the ringing morphed into the alarm I always set for the morning. The familiar tone brought a relieved sigh out of me. I wiped the sweat off my face and smiled widely when I saw my Mom’s beautiful smile on my lockscreen.

*That was such a weird and horrifying nightmare.* That thought went through my mind when I stepped out of bed. 

Turning around towards the living room, my foot hit something. And an ominous feeling surged within me. 

*No, no, no.*

I looked down and saw my gun. Not where I usually hid it: under my bed. No. It was right where I placed it before falling unconscious in my nightmare. 

My breathing sped up as my mind made up different scenarios on why this could've happened. The first reasonable thing was maybe I developed into a sleepwalker. The other reason may again have something to do with the confusion I’d get when I drank alcohol. 

I picked up the gun, and moved to replace it in its usual hiding place. But a voice was telling me to hide it somewhere else. With a bit of a hesitation, I taped it behind my bedside table. 

Then I checked around the rest of the apartment and made sure that it was the same as yesterday. No additional furniture, and no random photos in my phone too. It seemed like it was only my gun that was misplaced. 

*I should just stop drinking.* I shivered as I slumped onto my couch. I was *not* an alcoholic. I occasionally drank and it was usually wine. The binge drinking from yesterday was a rare occurrence. But now, maybe I should stir clear of all types of alcoholic beverages for a while. 

I did not want to stress myself out so early in the morning so I just made a calendar note to go to the doctor and went to make breakfast. I also took out my diary and wrote everything before I could forget. Before long, the weird nightmare was pushed out of my mind and I went back to my usual routine. 

However, the unsettling eeriness returned that night. I prayed that I did not have to go through that again. But I couldn’t stop my body from falling asleep unless I forced myself to stay awake by drinking coffee or an energy drink. 

*Nothing’s going to happen. You’re going to a doctor and he’ll give you meds to solve your sleepwalking issues. You’re going to be fine.*

With a last look around my familiar room, I closed my eyes and surrendered to sleep.

——————

The next morning, I was ecstatic to find myself in the same, old, white apartment. In the same bed and with the same phone lockscreen. 

But that relief was gone when another thing was misplaced, or more appropriately, “added” to my things. 

The stool. It was never there before. It was certainly not there all day yesterday. But I, frozen in fear, saw that it was right where Casey placed them when she talked to me. 

And another thing: it felt warm. Like someone had just been sitting there for a while.

1nmpw0s,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductCheckpoint/comments/1nmpw0s/should_you_trust_dr_beckmann_carpet_stain_remover/,Should You Trust Dr Beckmann Carpet Stain Remover on Tough Messes,"The Dr. Beckmann Carpet Stain Remover with a brush applicator is a product that I’ve put to the ultimate test in my home. With kids running around spilling juice, a dog that loves tracking mud in, and an ongoing struggle to keep things looking clean, I really needed something that could tackle tough carpet stains once and for all. This product has been making the rounds on recommended lists, so I decided to see if it lives up to the hype—or if it’s just another overhyped item.

**Design and Usability**  
The product’s design honestly impressed me from the get-go. It boasts a compact bottle combined with a built-in brush applicator that really sets it apart. The brush isn’t just a gimmick—it’s genuinely smart and allows you to scrub out stains with minimal mess. Turning the bottle upside down moistens the applicator sponge, and the process is straightforward. This convenience makes it ideal for quick touch-ups when accidents happen, and trust me, they happen a lot here. The size of the bottle is also comfortable to hold, which is a critical point when you’re in “cleaning mode” and don’t want to struggle with awkward designs.  

**Effectiveness on Various Stains**  
My carpets have seen it all—red wine spills, greasy food drops, and even mud from dog paws. The Dr. Beckmann Carpet Stain Remover claims to handle a wide variety of stains, and that’s no exaggeration. The first stain I tested it on was a week-old coffee stain; to my relief, the active oxygen in the formula broke down the stain within minutes. It works on new stains like spilled juice in seconds but is also remarkably good on older, tougher ones. Even wool carpets seem to benefit without losing texture or color. For common stains like red wine or grease, this stuff behaves like a magic potion.  

[Check Dr. Beckmann 019519 price on Amazon.](https://reviews.senaar.com/p/b006zmnwys/)  

**Smell and Formula**  
Some cleaning products smell so strong that they just replace one problem with another, but fortunately, this isn’t one of them. It has a subtle, pleasant scent that isn’t overpowering. Importantly, it’s formulated with organic alcohol and active oxygen, which means it cleans effectively but does so in a way that’s apparently kinder on textiles. I didn’t notice any chemical smells lingering after use, which makes it great for households with kids or pets sensitive to odors.  

**Suitability for Different Surfaces**  
While the name highlights its purpose for carpets, I gave it a shot on an upholstered couch too, just to see if it could multitask effectively. Surprisingly, it worked just as well there. That said, I wouldn’t personally recommend using it on materials like leather or vinyl unless you absolutely know what you’re doing. It’s clear that the formula was intended to be gentle yet powerful on fabrics, particularly soft surfaces like carpets and rugs, but steering clear of harder materials would be prudent.  

**Strengths**  
- The built-in brush applicator, which works brilliantly for deep cleaning.  
- Effectively removes a variety of stains, including red wine, coffee, grease, and more.  
- Gentle on colors and safe for wool carpets.  
- Pleasant, subtle smell without harsh chemical odors.  

**Caveats**  
- Doesn't work as effectively on very tough, set-in stains unless combined with some elbow grease.  
- The bottle design, while compact, might drain product quicker than expected with frequent use.  
- Not suitable for all surfaces, like non-fabric materials or overly delicate upholstery.  

**Competitive Options**  
In the crowded market of stain removers, alternatives like Resolve Carpet Cleaner and Bissell SpotClean frequently get thrown around. Compared to these options, the Dr. Beckmann Carpet Stain Remover holds its own by offering a built-in applicator that improves precision and usability. For smaller spills and precise cleaning, the applicator gives this product an edge. On the downside, other brands like Bissell might be better for larger-scale messes that require a machine-based solution. Resolve offers multi-surface versatility, which this product doesn’t claim to match entirely. That said, the Dr. Beckmann Stain Remover targets its niche use exceptionally well.  

**Price Performance**  
I’ve tried cleaning solutions that fall into both bargain-bin cheap and premium-priced categories, so my bar was set fairly high. For the features offered—convenience, brush applicator, active formula—this carpet cleaner provides solid value for the price. Some products in the same price range simply don’t work as effectively or leave residues, so this one feels worth every penny. If regular spills and stains are a constant in your household, investing in this product seems like a no-brainer to me.

1nmpvkw,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1nmpvkw/filtering_cold_brewed_coffee_through_a_chemex_or/,Filtering cold brewed coffee through a Chemex or V60: a good idea or a stupid one?,"For the past year or so, I've been exclusively drinking cold-brewed coffee. I steep 80 grams of ground coffee in about a litre of water for 24 hours, filter it out and store it in the fridge.

I drink 180ml of this cold-brewed coffee twice each day (once with my breakfast for a quick pick-me-up and another in the evening to keep my energy levels up).

Just yesterday, I saw a video on Instagram by a doctor who claimed that drinking unfiltered coffee has been linked to an increase in LDL cholesterol due to the presence of diterpenes (the oily compounds in coffee).

To avoid an increase in LDL cholesterol, he suggested switching to coffee brewed through pour-over methods, as the paper filters apparently remove almost all the diterpenes from the coffee.

Now, I'm a person with dyslipidemia due to an autoimmune thyroid condition (Hashimoto's). I also have a family history of high cholesterol. Three months ago, my triglycerides were 195, and LDL was 160. I switched my diet completely and brought my triglycerides down to 59, but my LDL only saw a marginal reduction to 144.

If what that doctor said is right, switching to pour-overs should reduce my LDL further. The problem, however, is that I have acquired a taste for cold-brewed coffee and can't seem to let it go. I have consumed poured-over coffees before (V60) at local coffee shops, and although I liked them, I feel they're far inferior to cold-brew. They're not strong enough (in terms of caffeine) and lack the ""coffee"" taste I get with a cold brew.

This got me wondering if I can just pour the cold-brew over a Chemex or V60 and have the paper filters remove the diterpenes. This way, I would still be able to enjoy the strong taste and caffeine hit. But, will this work, or is it just wishful thinking? Do I have no other way out but to switch to pour-overs?",1,1758455326.0,IndiaCoffee,0,1.0,False

This is going to be quite long, but I need a place to express all of my feelings about what happened and if anyone cares enough to read through this if you can provide me any clarity I would be grateful for outsider opinions and advice. I was completely blindsided and dumped on 9/16. I was under the impression that everything in this relationship was perfect and going strong until he said those dreaded words.

So I (f, 23) and my ex (m, 23) had been dating for a year and a half. We met at a party in college, and we began a friends with benefits relationship fairly quickly after meeting. He had been about a year ish out from getting dumped by his previous ex which was a 7 year on and off relationship. He was really broken by that, and when I caught feelings for him about 6 months into hanging out he mentioned he wasn’t ready for a relationship, he was wanting to not have anything serious in college at the time. I, being stubborn and having already caught feelings, kept sleeping with him and I mentioned another 6 months later that I was going to have to stop seeing him if he couldn’t commit to me because I was getting hurt. He decided he wanted to try a relationship with me.

It might be important to note that a bit before this he had taken me up to his lake house just us and it was great, but we did have a conversation where I mentioned I was worried he would never love me the way he loved his ex, and I don’t remember exactly what his answer was but it wasn’t the most comforting option. I have no idea if this is important for anything in this story, but he is also an only child, and was more of a bottle up emotions person, though we were working on that together.

Honestly though, once he made it official, we were conventionally a perfect couple for a long time, or so I thought. Everything was so healthy in terms of how we treated each other and how we put effort in and how we communicated etc etc. It felt “boring” in the most healthy way-no drama, just a person to call home and be happy making memories with. He met everyone in my family and everyone loved him, and I met many people in his family/close family friends circle (since some people I couldn’t meet due to them being out of state) and he had said everyone loved me. We were planning a future together, not super specific yet because I’m in graduate school for another 2 and a half years but I was already planning externships and future job offers to be in states where we could both have the best job opportunities, since certain states only have his job running for half the year and some for the full year. We had thrown around loose ideas in conversation for our future house and property, since we wanted a farm together. We talked about marriage and having a kid together once I was out of school.

The only thing I can think of now that I look back is he did struggle to say “I love you.” He had a lot of walls when I met him, and he had a hard time being vulnerable around me for a while. But he opened up to me, and that vulnerability helped us grow and better our relationship. Around 6 months of dating (1.5 years total with FWB time included) I had been jokingly(ish) jabbing him about how he hasn’t said it and he knows how I feel about him (I accidentally said I loved him within a few weeks of dating after a few too many drinks one night out with him). He would say he doesn’t want to say it until he means it/he feels it, which is fair. He eventually said it one day when I left his place, and I clarified with him that he said it as well because I was surprised. He was firm in the fact he said it to me finally, and I was happy. I knew it was something he struggled with feeling so I didn’t push it to try to say it to him every time I hung up the phone etc. but I was just happy he said it. He would sparsely say it, but I want to make specific mention of the last time he said it. 1 year into dating (2 years total seeing each other) he went to his cousins wedding. He had a long conversation with his cousin one of those nights and had sent me an “I love you” text. Again I clarified with him the next day making sure he meant to say that and he said yes. He was acting very lovey, he even FaceTimed me to show me he drew our initials in the sand on the beach. I found out 4 months later when I went up to his family’s lake house again that the conversation he had that night with his cousin was about me, about us, and about our future. He said this to a different cousin (who brought up relationship conversation since she was close to getting proposed to) and that he wouldn’t mention the specific details to her due to some of it having to do with her proposal, but I was a part of this conversation so he wasn’t hiding that he had this deep conversation about our relationship that ended in him saying I love you again.

Well fast forward 2 months. I guess now that I’m thinking back on everything I noticed him being very slightly more distant, but it was nothing obvious. A slightly drier text conversation every so often? Being ever so slightly less intimate? Cancelling a plan every now and then? These things were different, but they were so minuscule and I completely thought that I was just more stressed due to my graduate school classes and he was just more stressed due to his new job demands. But I pride myself on having been good at communicating with him, and I did give him nonspecific prompts in these last two months like if he said he was fine I said “just fine? Do you wanna talk about anything?” Or “how are you feeling, are you okay?” And my frustrations are mainly here: he never said a word. We never had a conversation about the issues he was apparently having in the last 2 months before he dumped me. We made a promise when we started dating to communicate about things before we would ever have a real fight or break up, and he fully broke that. Even to the day of the break up.

Tuesday, he texted me asking if he could come over to my place after my classes and his work. He doesn’t normally do that, because I have a roommate and he doesn’t, so I was happy to have him over but I did note that it was odd, and because I didn’t have any sort of inkling anything was truly wrong, I thought he may have had a rough day at work and that he just wanted to hang out. So I texted back and said “of course, do you want to just chill and hang out or do you need to pick something up?” And he said “just chill”. No indication of an impeding break up conversation. I said “okay great I’ll thaw some steaks out so I can make dinner for us” and he just said “we’ll probably be fine”. Didn’t really see that as meaning I don’t need to cook dinner because he was going to break up with me and leave. Well he comes over and walks in the door and I say hi like normal, and he asks to go for a walk. I barely get an “uh” out of my mouth and he’s 3 steps into my apartment before he says “I want to end things. This is not a joke. Your stuff is in my car.” I was so blindsided that I had no words. Of course I didn’t get to say or ask things I wanted to at the time, I had my entire world flipped upside down and inside out in less than 15 seconds. He says he is confused about a lot of things in his life, including his career, where he wants his future to be, etc and that he doesn’t feel that he can grow while in our relationship. He said I did everything perfect and blah blah blah about how great I was as a partner but that he didn’t understand why he wasn’t happy. He said he feels lost and that he’s felt this way for several weeks now.

When I bring up a wedding we are supposed to go to together in 4 days, he says and that he didn’t want to go together and he wanted to break up with me before it because he didn’t want us to watch people commit themselves to a life of marriage and reading vows and stuff when he didn’t love me. Shocked, I asked about that. And he said he didn’t understand why he felt this way, but that he tried and could not love me. He said he doesn’t know if he ever did. He offered me to go to the gala we were planning on going to the weekend after because he “knew how much it meant to me” but I don’t think I can do that anymore. We made plans for months going to football games and events, and now I don’t know what to do about those.

He said he wants to be friends still since I “know the most vulnerable sides of him” and I’m “his best friend and he doesn’t want to lose that”. I said I don’t know if I could do that. I had mentioned I absolutely couldn’t if he was seeing someone else and he said “there’s no one else”. He did say “that you should know about” after a pause and I don’t know if that means anything or if I’m just overthinking a moment that was spoken from heightened emotions and lack of word planning.

Regardless, he said he would like to go to a coffee shop sometime soon to talk more about this with clearer heads. He unloaded all of my stuff into my house, we hugged, and he left. He has not reached out to me yet. Some of the things he returned broke me, like a whiteboard that we would draw little messages to each other on he had erased before giving back, and some of the things he kept also broke me, like one of the stuffed animals that became an integral part of our relationship. I imagine if he never felt anything he wouldn’t keep that?? I don’t know. And so now it’s been 4 days and my mind has run itself absolutely wild trying to understand everything.

My problem is this break up was both all of a sudden but also premeditated, solely on his part. He said to me he’s never dumped anyone before so he didn’t know the best way to do it, so I don’t know if he did it this way because he thought a “one and done” scenario would be the best way to do it (although it still doesn’t excuse him never having a conversation before breaking up with me, even if it wouldn’t have changed the outcome), or if he did it this way because of a less desirable reason.

One instance of my overthinking is whether there’s another girl. I don’t think he would lie in that conversation we had breaking up, but the nature of the way he broke up with me has me questioning what he’s really capable of. Of course I didn’t think it was an issue when I was in the relationship because I trusted him completely. But I think back and he did once have a woman’s heels in his apartment. They were not hidden at all, I would think if you were cheating and you know your partner was coming over that you would hide the evidence. He said his coworker broke her heel at work and was upset about it so he offered to try to fix it with his boot glue (and this guy loved his boot glue, so that doesn’t sound out of the ordinary). His facial expression did not seem to be guilty or caught, and again I trusted him so I didn’t think anything else of it. That same coworker ended up prank calling him another day randomly, but he said on the phone to her “I’m hanging out with my girlfriend and we blah blah blah” again feeling not very secretive. When I asked if that was the same coworker with the shoes he said yes but again didn’t look guilty at all, and it is not out of the ordinary for him to be friendly outside of work with coworkers—I once even went to the college bars with them and him. He always said he would not cheat on me and would break up with me before seeing someone else. It seems like such a long shot but again, I don’t know what to believe anymore.

I also still worry about his ex and his emotional connection to her. He did tell me somewhere throughout the relationship that he was fully over her, but I thought it was a little odd when thinking back about how we started, as well as the fact that his ex is hanging out with one of his best friends that is a girl (who I know personally and am not concerned about) and I know this friend and my ex talk almost daily. I found out about his friend and his ex hanging out by an Instagram post which he had already seen, so he knew they hung out whether by that or by general talking and I wonder if he is back in touch with his ex at all. Which brings me to the emotional connection.

I won’t lie and say that I wouldn’t go back to him if he offered right now. And when I think about if that ever happened in the future, I worry about what if he truly can never learn to love me? That I wouldn’t know unless we tried it again and he figured it out, or if he got help and worked through this now (but I don’t honestly think he will go to therapy). And that might not be worth wasting more time, or a loveless marriage, or even being friends while I’m one-sidedly in love with him. And I feel like this point specifically should drive my decision to be friends or not be friends with him. But I have no answers!! And I want to take him up on the offer to talk to him about it with clearer heads, but I don’t know if he will have any idea and honestly if he will even reach out to do that talk in the first place.

So I don’t know how I’m supposed to feel right now. Yes I have alllll the emotions, but I don’t know what to believe and I don’t know how I should feel about what he did. I also battle the thoughts of what could I have done better/differently to make him stay. And to be clear, I do think a relationship includes both people being able to grow with each other, but I don’t understand why he can’t when I can, and when I thought he was as well.

Also, randomly, I wonder if I should still let him use my Hulu account. I noticed he is watching The Handmaids Tail on my Hulu account since I was logged in there but it hurts me to see myself watching break up movies and that’s what he’s watching. I don’t wanna be petty and kick him off but part of me is angry about it. Do I kick his device off?

I’m assuming I should not reach out first. But what if he never reaches out? and if he does, how do I approach the conversation with him to make sure I have the truth for closure, without sounding accusatory and shutting him down in the conversation?

If you made it this far I appreciate you. My life has been an absolute mess dealing with this, a very exhausting and competitive graduate school program, and a bunch of random extra obstacles like a leaky ceiling that came out of nowhere. I have been trying to cope healthily, but I am a terrible overthinker and sometimes I just need someone to tell me “stop thinking, stop talking, this is this, and that’s it.” I feel like the more I try to actually try to heal myself the more things I question in my head, but having fully and truly loved, trusted, and cared about him, I don’t know if I should be questioning things. Any advice, comments, questions are welcomed, I appreciate anyone willing to help me process this nightmare.",1,1758455290.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Thus, these are the pointers that I found to be effective.

1. Derive formulas once rather than memorise them. It sounds painful, I know. However, you will thank yourself when the exam presents a problem that doesn't resemble your notes. You become invincible when you comprehend the ""why"" behind an equation.

3. Make a real-world connection. I promise you it's much easier to remember differential equations when you realise they actually explain how your coffee cools down, or torque when you think about opening a door. Simply put, engineering is the math underlying everything you see.
4. Track your study time. You don’t need to go full productivity-guru mode, but just keeping track of how long you actually study (vs. scrolling memes) is a game changer. I recommend using studentheon as it provide statistic so you know what thing you should work on next time.

1nmps3j,https://www.reddit.com/r/coworkerstories/comments/1nmps3j/office_weirdo_12_greatest_hits/,"Office Weirdo, 12 greatest hits.","I found this sub Reddit and I have my own stories to tell. FYI I'm in Asia not US

I have a coworker—calling him ""weird"" is the understatement. I've witnessed so many incidents that I'm seriously convinced the guy has something going on. Let's call him ""Weirdo."" (Names have been changed for privacy and to avoid confusion.)

Background: In my office, I have a close friend who's a charismatic office womanizer; let's call him ""Saint"" because that's how he appears on the outside. Saint is everything Weirdo wanted to be but could never achieve. Thanks to Saint's ""friendships"" with so many female coworkers, I've collected a ton of juicy stories about Weirdo.

1. The KFC ""Power Move"" Date: Female coworker Sarah was asked on a first date by Weirdo. Being kind and willing to give anyone a chance, she agreed. For this romantic first date, Weirdo took her to KFC. Felt kinda cheap for a first date. But it gets worse. He suddenly pulled out his laptop and said, ""I'm sorry, I'm kinda busy with my freelance work, so we can talk while I'm working."" His great idea for a first date was to show off how ""successful"" he was. Unsurprisingly, there was no second date.

2. The 48-Cent Boss Bribe: Our female Team Leader, Pia, is a very beautiful and sexy woman. On her very first day, Weirdo texted her (which she couldn't avoid as his new direct supervisor). He confirmed she was his new boss and promised to bring her coffee. When she told me, I thought he'd buy high-end coffee like Starbucks, which is very expensive here. Nope. Weirdo brought her a street vendor coffee that cost 48 cents. Again, hoping a woman would fall for his cheapness.

3. The Snack War: He had a side hustle selling local snacks in the office. At first, he sold them at a huge markup. When my friend (let's call her Lita) started offering the same snacks for much cheaper, he suddenly dropped his price so low it wasn't even profitable. Lita wasn't actually trying to run a business; she was just too lazy to make it a side hustle and wanted to teach him a lesson, which she did.

4. The Souvenir Interruption: Beautiful coworker Samir was approached by Weirdo many, many times. The most memorable was when he returned from holiday and brought her a souvenir: a very cheap candy. He presented it to her while she was in the middle of a conversation with her Friends-with-Benefits. Seriously, dude?

5. The Instant Bad Boy: In a random conversation, coworker Nina mentioned she preferred ""Bad Boys."" The next day, Weirdo showed up to the office in a metal band t-shirt and a fake earring, having completely changed his style. It obviously failed, not least because Nina already had a boyfriend.

6. Unsolicited Tekken Advice: During my lunch break, I was playing Tekken on the office PS5 with my female coworker, Ira. Weirdo suddenly interrupted and started giving Ira advice on how to beat me (since I wasn't going easy on her). Ira, who is temperamental and hot-headed, yelled at him for ruining her fun time.

7. The ""Helpful"" Escort (This happened to me): I got suddenly sick in the middle of the workday but managed to pull through until EOD. My coworkers were worried about me getting home during the busy rush hour commute (our trains become sardine cans). Weirdo lives in the same city, so they asked him to look out for me on the way home. We take the same train line but get off at different stations (I get off at Station A in the big city, he gets off at Station B in a local town). While waiting for the bus to the train station, a direct luxury bus to Station A arrived. It cost 10x the train price, but in my condition, I was willing to pay for comfort. I told Weirdo to go on without me, as I was taking the luxury bus. He refused and insisted on accompanying me. I asked, ""What about your bike at Station B?"" He said he'd get it tomorrow and take public transport home that night. Reluctantly, I agreed. When we arrived at Station A, I thanked him. He then asked, ""Can you take me home on your bike? I don't want to take public transport."" WTF. But, being gullible and bad at saying no, I agreed. So, in my sick condition, I had to drive him home before I could finally go home myself. Two days later, back at the office, everyone asked if Weirdo took care of me. I told them the real story, and everyone was fuming. Ira, being her hot-headed self, confronted and yelled at Weirdo for taking advantage of me. He just looked confused and said he was ""taking care of me on the luxury bus.""

8. The Boxing Match of Doom: Weirdo has a habit of making edgy jokes that never land. I don't know what the conversation was, but it ended with him telling a coworker named Eric, ""Then it should be me who slept with your wife."" Eric was ready to attack him, and we had to hold him back. Jokingly, someone suggested a public sparring match. Eric, being sane, refused. Then, someone else jokingly suggested Weirdo fight Dan, a team leader who freelances as an AMATEUR BOXER. Dan laughed and played along, saying ""yes"" as a joke. Unfortunately, Weirdo is a sucker for attention. He took it seriously and started provoking Dan repeatedly, even on social media. Dan finally decided to teach him a lesson. The fight happened, and a coworker even live-streamed it for those on late shift. Dan is an amateur boxer; Weirdo had zero experience. Dan held back so much—if he was serious, Weirdo would have been in the hospital for months. It was seriously funny watching Weirdo get sucker-punched over and over.

9. The ""Content Creator"": He moonlights as a content creator, but his videos make no sense. He makes ""reaction"" videos but just does this forced, cringey laugh. He also constantly boasts about how expensive his PC is, but even to my naked eye—and according to Saint, who games as a hobby—we know it's a mid-range setup at best.

10. Cyberpunk Snacks: He's obsessed with Cyberpunk and even named his snack business ""Local Snack Cyberpunk."" He made a T-shirt with a cyberpunk font for a team leader's birthday (let's call him Fred). Weirdo kept asking Fred if he was going to wear the shirt. What he didn't know was that Fred had already burned it.

11. The Uninvited Apology: His entire division had a gathering and deliberately did not invite him. The next day, while they were all having lunch together, he apologized to them for ""not making it to the event."" They didn't invite you, man. Why are you apologizing?

12. The Unfaithful Gym Rat: He has a fiancée, by the way, and still constantly (and unsuccessfully) flirts with other girls. We coincidentally go to the same gym. He's always boosting on social media about ""getting in shape,"" but in reality, he doesn't lift anything and just spends his time on the elliptical bicycle. He also brought a woman who was not his fiancée to the gym. I was seriously holding back from being an a** and asking, ""Hey, why does your fiancée look different today?""

So, in the end, Weirdo finally got fired because his KPIs were terrible with no sign of improvement. One of the Quality Assurance people told me he always did his job ""his own way."" If they asked him to do A, he would do B because his way was ""better."" He was fired in the most embarrassing way possible: the director told him to leave immediately and never come back. All his final paperwork and compensation would be handled by his Team Leader because the director didn't want to see his face anymore.

And that's the end of the many tales of Office Weirdo. I actually have many more, but these are the ones I remember best. ",5,1758455004.0,coworkerstories,2,0.86,False

I noticed he looks at me a lot and I’ll look at him, then we both catch eyes and look away, I’ve noticed prolonged touch at points and things like that but other than that no boundaries have or will ever be crossed. 

We will usually all sit on the sofa under a blanket (all 3 of us) or a blow up bed, watch movies and stuff like that until early hours and then in the morning I get up, make him coffee and we sit in the living room waiting for my partner to get up, idk might just all sound like friends stuff. I didn’t really realise how close we are until last night when we were at a party and kinda had to hide how close we are to everyone else like me secretly asking for his drink even though I had one and my partner and him sneaking it over to me.

This is going to be quite long, but I need a place to express all of my feelings about what happened and if anyone cares enough to read through this if you can provide me any clarity I would be grateful for outsider opinions and advice. I was completely blindsided and dumped on 9/16. I was under the impression that everything in this relationship was perfect and going strong until he said those dreaded words. 

So I (f, 23) and my ex (m, 23) had been dating for a year and a half. We met at a party in college, and we began a friends with benefits relationship fairly quickly after meeting. He had been about a year ish out from getting dumped by his previous ex which was a 7 year on and off relationship. He was really broken by that, and when I caught feelings for him about 6 months into hanging out he mentioned he wasn’t ready for a relationship, he was wanting to not have anything serious in college at the time. I, being stubborn and having already caught feelings, kept sleeping with him and I mentioned another 6 months later that I was going to have to stop seeing him if he couldn’t commit to me because I was getting hurt. He decided he wanted to try a relationship with me. 

It might be important to note that a bit before this he had taken me up to his lake house just us and it was great, but we did have a conversation where I mentioned I was worried he would never love me the way he loved his ex, and I don’t remember exactly what his answer was but it wasn’t the most comforting option. I have no idea if this is important for anything in this story, but he is also an only child, and was more of a bottle up emotions person, though we were working on that together.

Honestly though, once he made it official, we were conventionally a perfect couple for a long time, or so I thought. Everything was so healthy in terms of how we treated each other and how we put effort in and how we communicated etc etc. It felt “boring” in the most healthy way-no drama, just a person to call home and be happy making memories with. He met everyone in my family and everyone loved him, and I met many people in his family/close family friends circle (since some people I couldn’t meet due to them being out of state) and he had said everyone loved me. We were planning a future together, not super specific yet because I’m in graduate school for another 2 and a half years but I was already planning externships and future job offers to be in states where we could both have the best job opportunities, since certain states only have his job running for half the year and some for the full year. We had thrown around loose ideas in conversation for our future house and property, since we wanted a farm together. We talked about marriage and having a kid together once I was out of school. 

The only thing I can think of now that I look back is he did struggle to say “I love you.” He had a lot of walls when I met him, and he had a hard time being vulnerable around me for a while. But he opened up to me, and that vulnerability helped us grow and better our relationship. Around 6 months of dating (1.5 years total with FWB time included) I had been jokingly(ish) jabbing him about how he hasn’t said it and he knows how I feel about him (I accidentally said I loved him within a few weeks of dating after a few too many drinks one night out with him). He would say he doesn’t want to say it until he means it/he feels it, which is fair. He eventually said it one day when I left his place, and I clarified with him that he said it as well because I was surprised. He was firm in the fact he said it to me finally, and I was happy. I knew it was something he struggled with feeling so I didn’t push it to try to say it to him every time I hung up the phone etc. but I was just happy he said it. He would sparsely say it, but I want to make specific mention of the last time he said it. 1 year into dating (2 years total seeing each other) he went to his cousins wedding. He had a long conversation with his cousin one of those nights and had sent me an “I love you” text. Again I clarified with him the next day making sure he meant to say that and he said yes. He was acting very lovey, he even FaceTimed me to show me he drew our initials in the sand on the beach. I found out 4 months later when I went up to his family’s lake house again that the conversation he had that night with his cousin was about me, about us, and about our future. He said this to a different cousin (who brought up relationship conversation since she was close to getting proposed to) and that he wouldn’t mention the specific details to her due to some of it having to do with her proposal, but I was a part of this conversation so he wasn’t hiding that he had this deep conversation about our relationship that ended in him saying I love you again. 

Well fast forward 2 months. I guess now that I’m thinking back on everything I noticed him being very slightly more distant, but it was nothing obvious. A slightly drier text conversation every so often? Being ever so slightly less intimate? Cancelling a plan every now and then? These things were different, but they were so minuscule and I completely thought that I was just more stressed due to my graduate school classes and he was just more stressed due to his new job demands. But I pride myself on having been good at communicating with him, and I did give him nonspecific prompts in these last two months like if he said he was fine I said “just fine? Do you wanna talk about anything?” Or “how are you feeling, are you okay?” And my frustrations are mainly here: he never said a word. We never had a conversation about the issues he was apparently having in the last 2 months before he dumped me. We made a promise when we started dating to communicate about things before we would ever have a real fight or break up, and he fully broke that. Even to the day of the break up. 

Tuesday, he texted me asking if he could come over to my place after my classes and his work. He doesn’t normally do that, because I have a roommate and he doesn’t, so I was happy to have him over but I did note that it was odd, and because I didn’t have any sort of inkling anything was truly wrong, I thought he may have had a rough day at work and that he just wanted to hang out. So I texted back and said “of course, do you want to just chill and hang out or do you need to pick something up?” And he said “just chill”. No indication of an impeding break up conversation. I said “okay great I’ll thaw some steaks out so I can make dinner for us” and he just said “we’ll probably be fine”. Didn’t really see that as meaning I don’t need to cook dinner because he was going to break up with me and leave. Well he comes over and walks in the door and I say hi babe like normal, and he asks to go for a walk. I barely get an “uh” out of my mouth and he’s 3 steps into my apartment before he says “I want to end things. This is not a joke. Your stuff is in my car.” 
Holy shit. I was so blindsided that I had no words. Of course I didn’t get to say or ask things I wanted to at the time, I had my entire world flipped upside down and inside out in less than 15 seconds. He says he is confused about a lot of things in his life, including his career, where he wants his future to be, etc and that he doesn’t feel that he can grow while in our relationship. He said I did everything perfect and blah blah blah about how great I was as a partner but that he didn’t understand why he wasn’t happy. He said he feels lost and that he’s felt this way for several weeks now. 

When I bring up a wedding we are supposed to go to together in 4 days, he says and that he didn’t want to go together and he wanted to break up with me before it because he didn’t want us to watch people commit themselves to a life of marriage and reading vows and stuff when he didn’t love me. Shocked, I asked about that. And he said he didn’t understand why he felt this way, but that he tried and could not love me. He said he doesn’t know if he ever did. He offered me to go to the gala we were planning on going to the weekend after because he “knew how much it meant to me” but I don’t think I can do that anymore. We made plans for months going to football games and events, and now I don’t know what to do about those. 

He said he wants to be friends still since I “know the most vulnerable sides of him” and I’m “his best friend and he doesn’t want to lose that”. I said I don’t know if I could do that. I had mentioned I absolutely couldn’t if he was seeing someone else and he said “there’s no one else”. He did say “that you should know about” after a pause and I don’t know if that means anything or if I’m just overthinking a moment that was spoken from heightened emotions and lack of word planning. 

Regardless, he said he would like to go to a coffee shop sometime soon to talk more about this with clearer heads. He unloaded all of my stuff into my house, we hugged, and he left. He has not reached out to me yet. Some of the things he returned broke me, like a whiteboard that we would draw little messages to each other on he had erased before giving back, and some of the things he kept also broke me, like one of the stuffed animals that became an integral part of our relationship. I imagine if he never felt anything he wouldn’t keep that?? I don’t know. And so now it’s been 4 days and my mind has run itself absolutely wild trying to understand everything. 

My problem is this break up was both all of a sudden but also premeditated, solely on his part. He said to me he’s never dumped anyone before so he didn’t know the best way to do it, so I don’t know if he did it this way because he thought a “one and done” scenario would be the best way to do it (although it still doesn’t excuse him never having a conversation before breaking up with me, even if it wouldn’t have changed the outcome), or if he did it this way because of a less desirable reason. 

One instance of my overthinking is whether there’s another girl. I don’t think he would lie in that conversation we had breaking up, but the nature of the way he broke up with me has me questioning what he’s really capable of. 
Of course I didn’t think it was an issue when I was in the relationship because I trusted him completely. But I think back and he did once have a woman’s heels in his apartment. They were not hidden at all, I would think if you were cheating and you know your partner was coming over that you would hide the evidence. He said his coworker broke her heel at work and was upset about it so he offered to try to fix it with his boot glue (and this guy loved his boot glue, so that doesn’t sound out of the ordinary). His facial expression did not seem to be guilty or caught, and again I trusted him so I didn’t think anything else of it. That same coworker ended up prank calling him another day randomly, but he said on the phone to her “I’m hanging out with my girlfriend and we blah blah blah” again feeling not very secretive. When I asked if that was the same coworker with the shoes he said yes but again didn’t look guilty at all, and it is not out of the ordinary for him to be friendly outside of work with coworkers—I once even went to the college bars with them and him. He always said he would not cheat on me and would break up with me before seeing someone else. It seems like such a long shot but again, I don’t know what to believe anymore.

I also still worry about his ex and his emotional connection to her. He did tell me somewhere throughout the relationship that he was fully over her, but I thought it was a little odd when thinking back about how we started, as well as the fact that his ex is hanging out with one of his best friends that is a girl (who I know personally and am not concerned about) and I know this friend and my ex talk almost daily. I found out his friend and his ex hanging out by an Instagram post which he had already seen, so he knew they hung out whether by that or by general talking and I wonder if he is back in touch with his ex at all. Which brings me to the emotional connection. 

I won’t lie and say that I wouldn’t go back to him if he offered right now. And when I think about if that ever happened in the future, I worry about what if he truly can never learn to love me? That I wouldn’t know unless we tried it again and he figured it out, or if he got help and worked through this now (but I don’t honestly think he will go to therapy). And it’s not worth wasting more time, or a loveless marriage, or even being friends while I’m still in love with him. And I feel like this point specifically should drive my decision to be friends or not be friends with him. But I have no answers!! And I want to take him up on the offer to talk to him about it with clearer heads, but I don’t know if he will have any idea and honestly if he will even reach out to do that talk in the first place. 

So I don’t know how I’m supposed to feel right now. Yes I have alllll the emotions, but I don’t know what to believe and I don’t know how I should feel about what he did. I also battle the thoughts of what could I have done better/differently to make him stay. And to be clear, I do think a relationship includes both people being able to grow with each other, but I don’t understand why he can’t when I can, and when I thought he was as well. 

Also, randomly, I wonder if I should still let him use my Hulu account. I noticed he is watching The Handmaids Tail on my Hulu account since I was logged in there but it hurts me to see myself watching break up movies and that’s what he’s watching. I don’t wanna be a bitch and kick him off but part of me is angry about it. Do I kick his device off?

I’m assuming I should not reach out first. But what if he never reaches out? and if he does, how do I approach the conversation with him to make sure I have the truth for closure, without sounding accusatory and shutting him down in the conversation? 

If you made it this far I appreciate you. My life has been an absolute hell hole dealing with this, a very exhausting and competitive graduate school program, and a bunch of random extra crap like a leaky ceiling that came out of nowhere. I have been trying to cope healthily, but I am a terrible overthinker and sometimes I just need someone to tell me “stop thinking, stop talking, this is this, and that’s it.” I feel like the more I try to actually try to heal myself the more things I question in my head, but having fully and truly loved, trusted, and cared about him, I don’t know if I should be questioning things. Any advice, comments, questions are welcomed, I appreciate anyone willing to help me process this nightmare. ",1,1758454760.0,Breakupadvice,0,1.0,False

1nmpoh4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Finland/comments/1nmpoh4/if_anyone_is_starting_to_feel_down_because_of_the/,If anyone is starting to feel down because of the weather and up coming darkness this is for you,"Hi everyone!
Summer is gone and so it's the beautiful weather and hyped environments. If you have lived in Finland for longer than a year you know how hard things can get after summer and the upcoming winter season. 

It's not only depression but also isolation. If you are an immigrant you also know how rough it's to find friends, and have the energy to not procrastinate and keep yourself mentally healthy with good habits and so on.

I'm writing this message to help you prepare for the ""rough"" times and to offer you my friendship :) but more on that soon. Let's start with the tips!

1. Get a sun bath lamp as soon as you can. Living in Finland for more than 5 years has taught me that when the gray days start to happen more regularly there is nothing like waking up and turning this lamp on. It seriously can help you feel better with 5 minutes or more Infront of it.

2. Join a club or a sports hobby.
This is a basic but still very important. With the rising cold and upcoming winter, staying at home seems the logical place to be, the problem is that it's way to easy to stay at home all day and not touch grass and interact with others. If you have the possibility of joining a group for something you like I highly encourage you to do it. 

3. Check out cheap courses in sites like ilmonet. 
Usually you can make friends and try different things for really cheap. This is a very nice way to explore yourself and keep you engaged during autumn and winter.

4. Go pickup mushrooms before they are gone! 
If you are new to Finland I encourage you to try out a Finnish mushroom picking group and explore all the possibilities. Seriously this is something you won't regret.

5. Try to do more cold water plunges. 
Combine this with the amazing sauna treatments and add as a ""cherry on top of the cake"" some Avanto or cold plunging. 
This is a fantastic way to feel alive and adapt your body to the cold. It can also help you out connecting with others since finns tend to speak more with rougher activities (much better than socializing with very drunk people) 

6. Visit old forests and make sure to bring something to grill! 

There are literally thousands of places you can visit and grill something up! Usually people will be silent there and just grill stuff but if you wanna socialize there is no problem at all. People here are very polite and respectful. 
Finns, you are awesome! 🙂‍↕️😁

7. Make sure to start taking vitamin D, magnesium, zinc and vitamin C. 

Specially vitamin D here is a must do!

8. Join a coffee group for chatting. This is a quick way to get to know people and maybe try your Finnish. Go for it!

Lastly I wanna wish you all a good autumn 🍁 and if you are coming to Helsinki for a visit or if you wanna get in touch with me I'm more than willing to have a chat and maybe take a sauna together!

If you have time this 28th of September I'm organizing a presentation about wellness  and some other tips to have more ease with life. It will be in Oodi library. You are more than welcome to come! Here is the link to join if you are interested: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-story-is-yours-lets-begin-tickets-1647766336469?aff=oddtdtcreator

Thank you all for reading and I hope this information helps you prepare for the beautiful but hard winter to come!
Tsemppiä!

For 2 hours after turning off the light,
kept tossing and turning while
remembering the lyrics of an old Hindi
song
For various reasons, it has become my
favourite song in the last two months. I
decided to go out for a walk to calm my
mind.


Alone in that moonlight, gazing at stars, I
set off to my destination, where I get the
best chocolate coffee in Kolkata, Tripti
Cafe.


The store closes at 11:30 p.m., and from
12 a.m., nightlife in Elgin Tower will start


The place is a bit far from the core of Elgin
Tower, near an old palace, where you find
that typical aesthetic feature of Kolkata
Flowers growing from cracks in
pavements, that gold-tinted palace,
bougainvillaeas, and coffee
When I started sipping the chocolate
coffee,a terrible feeling of missing
someone in life hit me hard.
A gentle breeze whispered that song again
in my ears.
'Kabhi Kabhi mere dil mein,Khayal aata
hai'.


Can we really substitute a person for
someone else in our lives? I don't think so.
Some people are special because they are
unique in our lives. But we never admit it
to that person. Sometimes we have to let
them go away from us. At that time, we
have to lie to them and to everyone else
that nothing is permanent and everything
is replaceable in life.


We are deeply burying a truth inside our
deepest corner of the heart: that some


people are simply
irreplaceable in life,
and we are wearing a smile out to show
them our fake confidence
Let the people kill them in front of us and
convince us that they left us. Still, a piece
of them exists in our hearts.


I remember the last time I met a person
like that in my life, I was so determined to
preserve that smile forever. Do I have to
get half the moon for that person ? 1 can't
But I wanted to take that person out for a
chocolate coffee on a rainy day, tell a
thousand jokes, and see the person smile
brighter than ever


But there are things that can kill
everything. Like a nuclear bomb.


We will eventually learn that arguments
kill, but we wish we could argue more
with them. Over agreements kill, but we
want to shout loudly that we will stay with
them with all of our might and will.
Beyond that, fate can kill anything, but we
want to tell them, 'Let's forgive the past
and fate'


All of a sudden, my thoughts came to an
end when those posh Ferraris started
flashing on highways. Elgin's nightlife


We have 800 crore people and


innumerable places in this world. But we
have our own type of people and places
where our hearts can smile A person who
makes our lives special by being a part of
us is always a special person to us


A remarkable and irreplaceable moment,
though we don't get it for a second time!",4,1758454648.0,Coconaad,0,1.0,False

So I brewed French press as usual (15g coarse grind, C2 at 26 clicks, ~1:16.5 ratio with james hoffman receipe), then ran the finished brew through an Aeropress. Since you’re pressing, no clogging — and it stripped out a surprising amount of fines (see pic).

End result? Still had the body of French press, but with the clarity of Aeropress. Honestly, best of both worlds.

You had headphones on at first, but when you came closer you slipped them off. Maybe you wanted to talk? I wanted to too, but nerves got in the way.

If you felt the same spark, tell me something I was wearing so I’ll know it’s you. Maybe we could do something nerdy and fun for two shy people — coffee, a walk, a movie, a play, geocache… or even laundry. 😉",0,1758454402.0,Portland,1,0.4,False

Since almost as long as I’ve had it, I’ve had a weird issue where there are always black/brown specks in the water during an automatic/manual rinse cycle. If you manually run the cycle e.g. 10 times in a row it still looks exactly the same at the end. When making coffee it’s not nearly as bad but you do still see some bits sometimes. 

I’m in a hard water area but regularly run descale cycles with the official cleaner and also clean the infuser every so often. It doesn’t seem to make the slightest difference. There is currently no filter installed but I have tried them in the past and not noticed much difference

Following a move I’ve just brought the machine out of storage after nearly a year (it was thoroughly cleaned and emptied first) and the problem has started off even worse with big flakes even after running several clean cycles - see photo. However, if I use the Hot Water option it looks OK apart from some limescale

Funnily enough this is the second Delonghi machine I’ve owned and the first had a similar problem which I put down to it being a refurbished item

Just wondering if anyone knows what’s going on? Possibly some old coffee particles got dislodged in the move but doesn’t explain past issues.

So for the last 3 months me and my bf are going through a very rough patch. 

The backstory -  

We have been dating for almost 8 months now, things were going well in beginning later I feared that he has been hiding things from me, he has never made me meet his friends, whenever I ask him he would say they are not in town or its too early he likes to keep his relationship to himself it was not my intention to try to snoop into his friends group as it's my first relationship ever I thought things like this are pretty common. 

Later in July I saw him at a coffee place where me and my friend went, we've been there for hours and then I saw him walking with a girl which I had no idea off who she is I just saw her once in his followings and he never mentioned about her too me and it was very odd cause at the same day he told me he's not in town, he saw us and instead of coming inside he went away, when I called he said I'll call you back later in night I asked who was she? He told me she was a friend of friends and they just ""apparantly"" bumped into eachother, keep in mind he was not in town so when I asked did you lie that you were not here? He told me he had come back because his father had some work to do and he was visiting the shop to buy something which was right next the coffee shop we were in - I couldn't comprehend all of that and that girl won't leave my mind. 

Things were getting really weird bw us now to just know who she's actually I digged way too deep which later hurted me like hell - later I got to know she was in a trip which he went before meeting me and told me to my face that there was this just 3 people including him never mentioned her, when I asked he again said ""not a relevant person"". 

Later I got to know through someone else that she randomly goes on dates and does ONS ( not judging her choice )
But the thought of what I'm getting myself into was at high, I couldn't tell him this all about her as I didn't wanted to ruin someone's image, there wasn't any proof of her ONS but her dating story was wild additional information - she's also getting married which he told me later this year. 

Now 3 days ago I told him this all and expressed why I was feeling so insecure about her and why she has been a constant debate of our fights, he now tells me that he can't even hangout with his friends now and he has to keep this big thing hidden from the rest of them, he feels very blindsided, blamed me for doing all these enquiries. \

 I was miserable seeing her with him, I explained that all well too him, he understood took my word, I apologized for it, but wouldn't it be possible he could've known this from someone else too? Or he might actually know about this who knows? 

Idk what to do at this point and also he had told me that he will be away from town for 3 months to complete a requirement of the course he's studying but in the morning I was in his area and suspiciously his wifi got connected to my phone seeing that I went inside and saw his bike parked infront of the parking lot, I asked him are you still here? Told me no the wifi guy didn't took off the wifi yet his owner said he will have that happen ( he lived in a rented room which he emptied that's what he told me ) and about the bike he told me he asked his owner to let the bike be there he will collect it later on. 

Am I being a fool? Btw he also told me I am paranoid. ",1,1758454120.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

I'm a total newbie and wanted to write a small review on all the perfumes I own on a budget !!

1. Aqualogica Sun kissed vanilla : Rs 400 
This was a complete blind buy and I'm totally in love with this. It smells so yummy and I've got so many compliments on it for smelling like a vanilla cupcake. 9/10
2. Victoria's secret : Rs 900 - Nykaa pink sale
I was eyeing this for a long time and finally got my hands on this during the pink sale. 
It smells so floral and girly. The kind of perfume I would wear to a picnic. The only downside is it doesn't last long. 8/10
3. Plum moon kissed drama : Freebie
Idk if they've this on their website but I got this full bottle as a freebie and i kinda like this scent. The top notes are black berry, rose, sweet scent and base is vanilla. It smells like blue berry pancake tbh !! 7/10
4. Moody perfume set : Rs 600
I got this as a gift and it has 4 different perfumes 
a) Tropical vanilla - The best out of the four. It is purely vanilla and smells great according to the price. 7/10
b) White musk and rose - The top notes are cucumber and berries and middle note is rose. It smells like rose and musk but there is this synthetic scent with it. 6/10
c) Strawberries & champagne - It was mid. This smelled very alcoholic and it did fade into a decent fragrance but ughh no. The top notes are orange & strawberry with a base of Jasmine and patchouli 5/10
d) Woodland blossom - I'm a hater for this. 1/10
5.Blur Vanilla melts, coffee cake and cookie crumble  : I got the combo set of three EDP for Rs 1000 on their website.
Vanilla melts smells really delicious. It is a very sweet scent but I'm a vanilla girly so I really love it. I got it just last week so I've not used it much a for a rating. I'll update later Hehe.
6. Bella vita perfume set : Rs 500
Imma just say the best is the rose one. It smells exactly like rose and has a floral hint. So if you're on a budget and wanted something floral get the rose bottle!! The rest of them are very strong and alcoholic. 5/10

That's all for now. I'm hoping to get more perfumes which are long lasting in this humid weather. I'm open to suggestions/ recommendations ♡

In vic. New mains new switchboard and 95% new wiring (some
Wiring from 2015. 
The sparkies added a new kitchen circuit. It was a nightmare bodge job to be honest and I won’t go into that . It cost me 10k+ and Ever since then I’ve had weird shit like microwave not lasting long (blew up), kettle failed. Occasionally rangehood lights flickering and kettle occasionally trying to turn itself on (just the touch base beeping randomly which I thought was just contact related but buying a new kettle didn’t fix it - it beeps without anyone touching it.) 

Anyway I regularly flick the rcd test buttons at the board and they work fine. I also periodically plug an rcd tester in and trip via rcd at the power points because someone told me  that testing at the board is  flawed as it tests the switch action  and not the circuit itself? 

I’ve now noticed the rcd test button on the handheld tester won’t trip this circuit despite polarity showing correct. What’s the go with that? All other circuits work and trip fine (including shed power point rcds on a sub main. So I know the tester is good) 

Appliances are all connected to this circuit (dishwasher kettle range hood microwave coffee machine, gate opener) Can an appliance soak up the rcd test current and cause it not to trip? Or do I need to call sparky out? Seems kinda fucked up and my default is to call them out as I have kids and safety is my only concern especially as the kitchen is the most dangerous area of the house given wet hands etc  

To be clear I am absolutely not interested in diy. I suppose using an rcd tester is maybe frowned upon.

They’re very very vivid and disturbing, they’re often very graphic and violent and trigger panic attacks when I wake up. 

I’m currently on 2mg of prazosin for the nightmares and take quetiapine as needed for sleep which is also supposed to help but they’ve still been occurring. Ive also previously taken amitriptyline and melatonin to help with sleep, I’ve never noticed any changes in dream occurrence across any of my sleeping meds. 

At the moment I’ve been having them very frequently and they’ve been so graphic that I’m afraid to go to sleep. When I do sleep they wake me up and everytime without fail if I go back to sleep after one I have an even more horrible one. I’m so exhausted and it’s really affecting my mood. I’m pretty desperate for something to try. 

I’ve tried having a soothing cup of tea or warm milk before bed, I’ve tried watching cosy/kids movies as I fall asleep, I’ve tried reading, listening to audiobooks, putting on white noise. I have a list of things to think about as I fall asleep like what my dream vacation would be or how I’d plant a flower garden (basically stuff that’s soothing and gentle). I spray lavender on my pillow and have a nice relaxing night routine. I have blackout curtains but leave a little night light on so it’s not too dark to see if I open my eyes.    

I don’t drink coffee or alcohol. I don’t smoke. I don’t watch horror movies ever and if something I’m watching in the afternoon/evening gets a bit too violent or scary I usually pause it and switch to something nicer. I don’t eat a meal right before bed.

I was sitting at my desk at 2 AM, AGAIN, trying to turn a 15-minute YouTube video into LinkedIn posts, Twitter threads, and Reddit content. My eyes were burning, my coffee had gone cold for the third time, and I was only halfway done.

That's when it hit me: **I was spending MORE time rewriting content than actually creating it.**

Sound familiar? Here's the insane part - I calculated that I was spending 6.5 hours EVERY WEEK just reformatting the same ideas for different platforms. That's 338 hours a year. That's nearly 9 work weeks of pure, soul-crushing copy-paste-rewrite hell.

The worst part? The manually rewritten content STILL performed like garbage because:

* LinkedIn posts sounded too casual (copied from TikTok style)
* Twitter threads were too formal (copied from LinkedIn style)
* Reddit posts got downvoted for sounding ""corporate"" (copied from everywhere)

Each platform has its own language, its own vibe, its own unwritten rules. Miss the mark and your content dies in the algorithm graveyard.

**So I did what any frustrated entrepreneur would do - I built a solution.**

After 3 months of development (and way too much coffee), I created an app that takes ANY transcript from YouTube, TikTok, or Instagram and rewrites it specifically for Twitter, LinkedIn, and Reddit. Not just copying - actually understanding context and rewriting for each platform's unique style.

The results? My content creation time dropped from 8 hours to 2 hours per week. My engagement rates went up 340% because the content actually FITS each platform now.

**Here's what it does:**

* Takes your video transcripts (YouTube/TikTok/Instagram)
* Analyzes the content and context
* Rewrites it in the perfect tone for Twitter, LinkedIn, or Reddit
* Maintains your voice but adapts to platform culture
* Saves you 6+ hours per week (seriously)

I've been testing it myself for 2 months and the time savings are absolutely insane. Now I want to see if it helps other creators escape the rewrite prison too.

Alright, friends, gather ‘round because I have a story that might just resonate with you, especially if you’ve been riding the *hustle hard or go home* train for far too long. 🚂💨

So, there I was: a proud member of the #TeamNoSleep club. **I thought if I wasn’t hustling 24/7, I was failing.** I was glued to my laptop, cramming my calendar with back-to-back meetings, late-night brainstorming sessions, and a never-ending list of tasks. I mean, who doesn’t love a good “rise and grind” meme, right?

But then something beautiful happened: **I hit a wall.** You know, the kind that makes you wonder if that third cup of coffee is actually doing anything or if you're just one more tab away from a total meltdown. ☕️💥

**Here’s what changed my life:** I decided to stop hustling so hard and actually start working smarter. And oh boy, did it pay off!

🔑 **Key takeaways from my little experiment:**

1. **Prioritize Like a Boss:** I started asking myself, “What actually moves the needle?” Spoiler alert: responding to every email *isn’t* on that list. Now, I tackle my top 3 priorities each day. 

2. **Limit Distractions:** I mean, we all love a good cat video, but seriously, do they need to consume half my afternoon? I set specific times for breaks (and yes, those cat videos are now a reward). 

3. **Say No More:** There’s power in the word “no.” I began to guard my time like it was gold. 🌟 If something didn’t serve my goals, I passed. My schedule started breathing again!

4. **Build in Downtime:** Ironically, stepping back made me more creative and effective. Who knew that binge-watching “The Office” could spark my best ideas? (Michael Scott, you genius!)

5. **Reflect Often:** Instead of racing to the finish line, I started taking moments to reflect on what’s working and what’s not. It’s like course-correcting your ship instead of just sailing into the stormy seas.

The craziest part? Since I implemented these changes, **I’ve saved over 20 hours a week**! And guess what? I’m achieving more than ever—just by being intentional instead of chaotic. 🙌

So, here’s the deal: **The hustle culture is overrated.** Sure, there are seasons where you might need to grind, but let’s make sure that grind is effective, right?

I’m reaching out because I could really use some advice or connections 🙏

I currently work in marketing/comms/sales at the HQ of a well-known French multinational hotel group. I’m getting married in April and moving to Dubai to be with my husband (finally, after 2 years of LDR), but I’m also feeling quite anxious, because I *need* to find a job there. Becoming a housewife is just not for me.

I’ve met some of my fiancé’s friends and their wives, they’re all lovely people, but many of them are stay-at-home, their conversations revolve around designer bags and shoes… no hate though, but I know in my gut that I need to be working, building something of my own, and continuing my career. I’m very driven, and I’ve worked hard to get where I am professionally. I’d hate to lose that momentum. I unfortunately cannot keep my current job and move there, my whole team is in Paris. 

So, if you live in Dubai, work in marketing, communications, hospitality, or sales, or just have advice on job hunting in the region, I’d love to hear from you. Are there specific companies hiring international profiles? Agencies to register with? Tips on how to make my CV stand out or how to frame my relocation story?

I’m open to connecting, networking, even grabbing a coffee once I’m in town. Thanks so much in advance for any pointers. 🙏

did you drag me back
after all those talks
about trying just a little?
to all that stripped, starving love,
the yellow flowers rotting
in the kitchen sink,
their petals curling like old regrets —
only to leave the next morning,
so unsure.
and i’m alone.

did you leave me
to hide my eyes
from the blur
of strangers glowing in the dark,
while i walk these streets
with my fingers intertwined
so i don’t have to let you go?

did you love me
just a little,
or was i only
the quiet part
before you (—?)

i had something
that made me smile in the morning.
now i wake with less,
my stomach twisting,
thinking maybe
somewhere out there
the next me
is lost among a crowd
of maiden strangers.

sometimes
i think i see her
in the window of a passing car
but she doesn’t know me —
not yet,
maybe never.

sometimes
i sit in the places we used to go
and they pull me back
to the best of us,
and the worst,
the sharp words you left
between your teeth.

do you remember
how warm your coffee cup felt?
i do.
why don’t you?

it’d be nice
if you said
my runaway thoughts
aren’t real.
if you called,
told me, “I miss you.”
say anything
i could take —
one more night of fighting in your house,
just try a little because god,
i’m still here,
still feeling your absence,
you're a body i can’t stop walking toward
and talking to in the dark.

1nmp78t,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nmp78t,Anyone know this novel?,"My husband Kyst finally came home after not answering my calls all night.
His clothes are a mess, and his neck is a little red. 
When he takes off his shirt and I notice long red scratches on his back, he turns around and I see hickeys all over his neck and chest, and my world stops.
I close my eyes as he approaches. He sets his wallet and keys on the bedside table and walks over to his side of the bed. 
He says, but when I don't respond, he pauses briefly before telling me he loves me.
I attempt to close my eyes and go to sleep, but the scent of perfume on his wallet brings tears to my eyes, and I come to the conclusion that my husband cheated on me.
————————
Juniper watched her husband preparing dinner for her and wondered if she was losing her mind.
From the minute she'd left the office of the Phineas Perez, she'd been conflicted, wavering back and forth between guilt and anger. He'd lied to her about where he was on Friday. She could be a client he needed to respect privacy laws for. He was having an affair. It could have been innocent. Back and forth.
Yet for the first time, she was watching his movement carefully, suspiciously. Every step past her, his fingers brushed against her, making sure they always touched her. Each time he set something on the table, he pecked her cheek.  Each touch she cringed internally, unsure whether it was him or her she hated more.
""You went through a lot of trouble to make dinner.""
""Nothing is too good for my beautiful wife,"" Kyst leaned over her and pressed a peck to her neck, that special soft spot which always made her wriggle. He nipped it and winked at her. ""You look beautiful today.""
""Thank you,"" she stared into his blue eyes, a deep indigo and doubted again how someone so attentive and loving could possibly be cheating on her.
He frowned, ""what's the matter, baby? You look ready to cry all of a sudden?""
""Nothing. Overtired maybe. I got called to the CEO's office today."" She studied his face for any sign of nervousness at the revelation. ""It gave me a headache.""
""Phineas Perez's office? What did you get called up there for?""
""Delivering documents,"" she told the first lie she'd ever told to her husband. ""He recognized me because Mom works for his parents.""
""Right. I always forget her employers are his parents. Did you get to go into his office or just stand outside and look in? Us being mere mortals don't usually have a front row seat to the inner sanctums of the rich and fabulous."" He pecked her nose.
""Yeah, I put the files right in his hands. He was not a pleasant person. Really rude. Not much nice to say about anyone, actually.""
""You know, I find it's the way with my wealthier clients too. They have God complexes,"" he made a face and turned back to stir the risotto he was preparing for her. It was her favorite dish. He liked to make it with mushrooms they picked up from a local farmer's market they attended every Saturday. ""You made it out alive though, eh?""
""I did. Did you know he's married?""
""No. Though, I'm not the kind of guy who reads the tabloids of the rich and famous. What brings it up?""
""He didn't even have a picture of her in his office and no wedding ring either. I thought it weird he didn't wear a ring.""
""I never take mine off. I'd rather die, and I keep your photo right on my desk at work and you're my phone screen saver too. Nothing makes me happier than seeing your face."" He lifted his phone to look at a notification and he nodded and put it down, ""two more days before your fertility cycle hits. We should spend all of Thursday night in bed.""
Their intercourse life at the moment was rotating on a schedule devised by her physician. She knew he was finding it frustrating, but he was being incredibly supportive. She'd intended to tell him over the weekend there was no need to schedule things because her doctor told her at the appointment Friday they were successful. She was officially pregnant. Then she panicked because she felt cramping before even leaving the office. Two other miscarriages in the past made her hesitate and so she'd flaked out and not told him.
Now she was glad she hadn't. If what Phineas suspected was correct, would she even want to have his baby?  The thought made her hand float to her stomach, and she shivered nervously.
""Babe?"" Kyst called out. ""Thursday night? You, me? Dinner and dessert in bed?"" he winked at her playfully.
""Yes. Sorry. Zoned out. That's sounds lovely.""
""Good. It's a date,"" he leaned over her and pecked her mouth slowly, his tongue dragging along her lower lip, ""it'll be a very beautiful, long date."" His breath was hot against her ear, as he whispered, ""I'll be so glad when we can be spontaneous again babe. I'd love to just throw you up on this table and have you for dinner instead of rice.""
She giggled and pushed him back, ""soon, Loverboy.""
Watching him humming happily under his breath as he dished up their dinner and then sat beside her pouring her sparking juice into a wine glass.
""I know we aren't drinking at all right now in preparation for the baby we are going to create this week,"" he made an effort of showing her positivity, ""so some sparkling grape juice for my girl.""
""You're the best,"" she leaned forward and pecked his lips softly. Yet as she got close to him a scent lingered near his collar. She put her nose right against his shirt and inhaled.
He pulled away from her with a laugh, ""babe, are you sniffing me?""
""Did you change your deodorant or cologne or anything?""
""No. Why would I change it when you like it?"" he took a mouthful of his dinner.
Cloyingly sweet.
The words from Phineas Perez earlier in the day bounced around in her head. The barely there scent on his shirt, maybe from where this other woman might have reached out and touched his collar or adjusted his tie, transferred from her wrist, was there.

She touched him. Sometime in the day, today, Denise Perez touched her husband's collar.
She rose from the table wordlessly and raced to the bathroom, barely making it time to position herself over the toilet and empty the contents of her stomach. She heaved hard, tears streaming down her cheeks and she heard his footsteps approaching as she kept her eyes closed.
He was holding her hair back and asking her what was wrong.
She slapped him away; aware she was potentially screwing up a sting operation for the morning but unable to stop herself. ""Your shirt stinks. Get away from me."" She was furious as he backed away in alarm.
""What do you mean my shirt stinks?"" he lifted it up and sniffed it.
She didn't miss the way his eyes rounded for a fraction and then shook his head.
""I don't smell anything.""
He was gaslighting her.
""I do.""
""Okay,"" he immediately unbuttoned it and shrugged out of it, dropping it into the hamper. ""Maybe you're smelling the bathroom spray or something from work, but I don't smell it. I don't know why it's made you sick though.""
""Must be my headache.""
""You've never suffered a headache which made you throw up before,"" he watched her with concern in his eyes as she cupped water from the bathroom sink into her mouth and spat it out. ""I'm worried honey. Maybe the stress of all this baby making pressure is getting to you. What if we stepped back a bit?""
""You don't want a baby now?"" she whirled on him furiously.
""No. I do. I do want to have a baby. I want to grow our family. I'm just worried for you. You're stressed. You're getting headaches you never used to get. You're throwing up, now. Friday I missed the appointment and usually you understand work things, but you didn't talk to me again until Saturday. It's a lot of pressure we're putting on you. It's all on you and I hate that we're doing this to you. If I could take it on me, I would but I feel guilty that it's you that is stressing over this the most."" He wrapped his arms around her, holding her head to his bare chest and pecked the top of her head, ""baby, I'm really worried about you.""
""I need to lay down,"" she whispered as tears streamed down her cheeks, grateful she couldn't smell the perfume on his bare skin. At least his clothes had been on today. She pulled herself out of his embrace, hating herself for hating him. Could it be bathroom spray? She knew his habits better than anyone and knew he used the men's room at work every morning after his second cup of coffee. Yet her gut told her it wasn't what he claimed it to be.
She wanted to scream at Phineas for doing this to her.
She crawled onto the bed aware her husband was following her. When he climbed up behind her to hold her she pushed him away. ""I just want to be alone.""
""I don't want to leave you alone. Not when you're like this. Something is wrong and you're not talking to me.""
""Please, Kyst. I just want to lay down and make this sick feeling go away.""
""I'll go put dinner away and maybe you'll want it later when you're feeling better."" He pecked her cheek softly, ""I love you Juni. More than anything in the world, I love you. I don't like you're this stressed out.""
He left the room with a worried sigh, and she closed her eyes and let the tears fall.
Later when she let Adil into the apartment while Kyst put the garbage out, she looked at him, ""he was with her today, wasn't he?"" When Adil hesitated while positioning a camera quickly over their door in an inconspicuous place, she pushed him, ""didn't he? I could smell her. He did!""
""He did. They met at the same coffee shop they always do, two blocks from his office.""
She watched him put the other two cameras up and then leave her apartment to disappear into the stairwell seconds before Kyst came out of the elevator. She was standing in the open door, strangely wanting to run after Adil and ask him to take her out of there. If she raced to it, she could catch up to him. Where would she go? She had nowhere to go. Her mother lived in an apartment on the grounds of the family she worked for. Her best friend was currently in Europe meeting the man she'd been dating long-distance for the first time and she'd be gone a full month or more.
Kyst's footsteps made her look up warily and the urge to slam the door in his face and lock him out was overwhelming.
""Hey, you're up again. What are you doing out here?""
She closed her eyes and shook her head, ""I thought maybe you left."" Lies. Lies, lies and more lies were falling from her lips, and she'd never lied to him a single time in their entire lives.
""Where would I go, sweetheart, I wouldn't bring you with? You go where I go. You're my entire world."" He swung her up in his arms before she could stop him and carried her into the apartment. ""You're still very pale. I don't like it. We need to make sure my beautiful wife is feeling better. I'm sorry you're feeling so crummy tonight. Come on, let's snuggle on the sofa and watch some tv before bed.""
He pecked her forehead softly and gently placed her on the sofa. He grabbed a throw blanket and tucked it around her legs. He sighed staring down at her when she wouldn't meet his gaze. He squatted in front of her and tilted her chin with his hand, forcing her to meet his eyes.
""Baby, I love you. You are my entire world. There is nothing I want more than for us to start our family and have a baby but, not at the risk of your health, mental, emotional, physical. If this pressure is getting too much, then we need to rethink this. I feel horrible I missed our appointment on Friday. It clearly as made you feel you I'm not as invested in this as you are and it's not the truth. I screwed up. I should've told my boss I needed to go. I should have prioritized you and our future, and I am sorry. It's unfair to you. I won't miss any more dates. I promise but I also mean it when I say, as much as I want this, if you're finding this too much pressure, we can stop. We were incredibly happy before the possibility of kids. I don't need anything but you in my life, Juni. A life we created is great, but I love you enough I'm good if it's just us.""
She stared into his eyes wondering how she was supposed to reconcile this, loving sweet man with a cheater. For the rest of the night, she couldn't stop wondering how it all went so wrong.",1,1758453020.0,u_Abject_Incident_4007,0,1.0,False

1nmp6al,https://www.reddit.com/r/TechGearReviews/comments/1nmp6al/showcase_the_best_wireless_headset_yealink_bh70/,Showcase the Best Wireless Headset Yealink BH70 for Work Calls,"Testing out the Yealink BH70 Mono Teams Certified Wireless Bluetooth Headset with a charging stand was an experience that underscored both its strengths and some of the areas where it could use improvement. This headset promises seamless integration with Microsoft Teams, an impressive 35-hour battery life, and three-mic noise cancellation, making it tempting for anyone juggling frequent calls in noisy environments. Sitting at my desk, swapping between work meetings, personal calls, and sporadic bursts of Spotify, I pushed this headset to its limits.

**Design and Comfort**

The design of this headset immediately stands out for its clean and minimalistic aesthetic. It feels professional without being over-the-top flashy. The earpiece features a rounded tip that comfortably fits over the ears, and the padded headband adjusts seamlessly for different head sizes. My teenage nephew even borrowed it for his online gaming session, and he confirmed that he forgot he was wearing it. What really strikes me is how lightweight yet durable it feels. You might expect something this light to feel flimsy, but this thing feels ready to survive desk drops or an overenthusiastic tug. 

**Immersive Audio Performance**

This headset has a knack for isolating your world. The three built-in MEMS microphones leveraging Yealink’s acoustic shield technology do an impressive job of canceling background noise. While seated at a bustling coffee shop, I joined a work call, expecting to hear baristas yelling drink orders in the background. To my surprise, I sounded clear on the other side, and I could distinctly hear every word from my colleagues. Switching over to Spotify, the dynamic EQ brought some deep bass oomph to my indie playlist and emphasized mids and highs when I switched to a podcast. Whether I was crunching numbers, head-bobbing to music, or participating in work meetings, this headset brought clarity to every mode I tested.

**Key Benefits**

- Certified for Microsoft Teams, enabling smooth integration and one-click meeting access  
- Three-mic noise isolation system effectively blocks background disturbances  
- 35-hour battery life, encouraging long-lasting use without interruptions  
- Lightweight, ergonomic design tested for extended periods of wear  

[See Yealink BH70 Mono Teams Certified Wireless Headset price on Amazon.](https://batterydiscounter.com/p/b0d2dgxy7r/)

**Battery Life and Power Features**

Battery life remains one of the strongest features of this headset. Up to 35 hours of talk time is no exaggeration; I’ve gone days without needing to recharge. Even if you somehow manage to squeeze out those hours in a single weekend conference marathon (which I ironically tried during a virtual event), the included charging stand makes juicing it back up a breeze. You know what’s even better? The charging process doesn’t sluggishly stretch out for hours. You can practically grab a quick burst of power during your lunch break and stay good for more calls.

**Limitations**

- Touch controls on the earpiece aren’t always responsive in frantic moments  
- Plastic carrying case feels like an odd choice for the otherwise premium build  
- Noise cancellation struggles when wind noise enters the mix during outdoor use  

**Competitors**

Now, comparing this headset to other market leaders like the Jabra Evolve2 Series or Bose 700 might seem challenging, but here's where it stacks up. The Jabra offers competitive sound quality and comfort but doesn't deliver as extensive a battery life. Bose triumphs in audio clarity during calls, yet it's hard to ignore its significantly higher price point for similar features. The Yealink BH70 punches above its weight class in terms of affordability, connectivity options, and integration with Teams, but still has room to grow, notably in touch control sensitivity and sturdiness of its case design. 

**Price to Quality Ratio**

Talking about price-to-quality ratio, I’d say this product delivers strong value for what it offers. Considering its professional-grade audio performance, extended battery life, and ergonomic construction, it addresses critical needs for most users, from office professionals to multitasking students like my cousin, who hijacked the headset after I was done testing it. While it’s not the absolute cheapest choice in the market, its features can justify a marginally higher investment when compared to more basic alternatives.

Are you confused about whether the 7 days cucumber diet plan actually helps to lose weight or not?



Well, I just tried this diet 15 days ago and it did help me lose weight.



Before my wedding, I wanted to lose 20 pounds fast in a month and when I heard about the cucumber diet, I knew it would very much help me to an extent.



I had many questions about this diet like



* Does it really work?
* Can it reduce belly fat?
* What if I eat too many cucumbers?



**How many calories does a cucumber have?**

I know for a fact that you have these questions in your mind too. Since I have researched and already tried it, I would love to help you out by answering all of these questions for you.



**What is The Cucumber Diet?**

The cucumber diet is an effective short-term diet that guarantees fast weight loss. This is a 7–14-day diet plan that is proposed for people struggling with overweight and obesity.



The diet promises you to lose up to 15 pounds in a week and is marketed as an effective and fast weight loss process which is often taglines as “7 Kgs in 7 days“.



Just like its name indicates, the menu of the diet is mostly composed of cucumbers. It instructs you to replace most of your regular foods with cucumbers so that your calorie consumption is lessened.



Since cucumbers are low on protein and fats, you need to intake a few protein-rich foods, such as eggs, chicken, fish, and nuts along with cucumbers. Because the diet lacks diversity it is not followed for more than 14 days.



**Here I am sharing my 7-day cucumber diet plan, which will help you to lose weight too.**



**How Does the Cucumber Diet Help You Lose Weight?**

The diet assists in short-run weight loss by limiting your calorie intake. Since there are no specific rules, this just emphasizes eating a cucumber whenever you’re hungry.



As cucumbers are composed of 90% water (1), their high consumption ensures satiety, and adequate hydration and reduces the amount of energy expended. Cucumber detoxifies your body, helps indigestion, and also cleanses the intestine.



Generally, one might think that eating so many cucumbers would eventually add up to a lot of calories but in reality, a regular (300 gram) cucumber just has up to 45 calories eating 10 would just be 450 calories.



Being on the cucumber diet for 7 days helped me to lose 4.3 kgs and you can even lose up to 5 kgs if you follow it correctly.

**If you have any recommendations or questions do reach out to me in the comments below.**



**Is it Effective for Weight Loss?**

The cucumber diet is naturally low in calories so one can expect to lose weight while flowing it. However, the weight loss mostly occurs only for the time you’re following it which is ideally 7-14 days. It is highly unlikely that you’ll lose a considerable amount of weight and keep it off once you resume your regular diet.



Since most people find it hard to follow a strict diet, they are unable to continue such a diet for the long term. Because they haven’t learned much about healthy eating, portion control, or reading nutrition labels they generally regain the lost weight. On the other hand, easy and slow-paced diets can be easier to follow and yield much better results.



Moreover, cucumbers lack protein, fat, fiber, calcium, iron, and many other nutrients. So even if we intake protein along with cucumbers with every meal there would still be a deficiency because of the lack of variety.



Therefore, to lose weight and stay healthy it is better to switch to a healthier and diversified diet.",1,1758452889.0,u_Witty_Bookkeeper9515,0,1.0,False

**Perpetua Resources** (Nasdaq: PPTA; TSX: PPTA) has received a notice to proceed from the US Forest Service, authorizing the construction of its $1.3 billion [Stibnite gold-antimony](https://www.mining.com/perpetua-advances-potential-2b-stibnite-loan/) project in Idaho.

The company secured its Record of Decision in January and received final federal approval in May, with Friday’s notice marking the last step before construction can begin once financial assurance bonds are posted.

The company expects to finalize bonding in the coming weeks, with construction slated to start by October.

**Shares of Perpetua rose 1% on Friday, trading at $17.59 in New York and giving the company a market capitalization of about C$1.89 billion.**

# Strategic critical mineral supply

The Stibnite project is expected to begin commercial production by 2028, with a 15-year mine life that could supply more than 100 million pounds of antimony, meeting over 35% of US annual demand.

Antimony is a metal vital to defense applications, including munitions, as well as renewable technologies like solar panels. Currently, the US has no domestic production of antimony and relies heavily on imports, primarily from China.

“This is a monumental milestone,” Perpetua Resources CEO Jon Cherry [said in a news release](https://www.investors.perpetuaresources.com/investors/news/perpetua-resources-announces-notice-to-proceed-0919). “After eight years of review and over $400 million invested, it is finally time for the Stibnite Gold Project to deliver for America. We are ready to bring Stibnite back to life as a national strategic asset.”

The project will also produce roughly 450,000 ounces of gold annually, providing a dual revenue stream. Proven and probable reserves at the site include 148 million pounds of antimony and more than 6 million ounces of gold.

Last April, the US Export-Import Bank signaled support for the project with a letter of interest for up to $1.8 billion in financing, which remains under review.

The project has backing from billionaire investor John Paulson and has also drawn political attention in Washington, particularly after China’s decision last year to block exports of antimony to the US.

# Environmental restoration and local concerns

Perpetua has emphasized the project’s dual focus on mineral production and environmental restoration. The final mine plan was redesigned to reduce the project footprint by 13%, improve stream and wetland conditions, and reconnect fish habitats.

Still, the project has faced opposition from Idaho’s Nez Perce tribe, which has raised concerns over potential impacts on salmon populations in the region.

Located in Idaho’s Stibnite-Yellow Pine district, about 222 kilometers northeast of Boise, the site was once a critical supplier of antimony during World War II.

The project hosts 104.6 million proven and probable tonnes grading 1.43 grams gold per tonne and 0.064% antimony for 4.8 million oz. gold and 148 million lb. antimony, according to the feasibility study.

# SEPT. 17th, 2025~What Energy Fuels (UUUU) North American Mine-to-Magnet Breakthrough Means for Shareholders

[What Energy Fuels (TSX:EFR)'s North American Mine-to-Magnet Breakthrough Means for Shareholders](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/energy-fuels-tsx-efr-north-121037339.html?guccounter=1)

* Energy Fuels Inc. announced that high-purity neodymium-praseodymium oxide produced at its White Mesa Mill in Utah has been successfully processed into commercial-scale rare earth permanent magnets (REPMs) by South Korea’s largest drive unit motor core manufacturer, passing all quality benchmarks for use in electric vehicle drive units for global automotive manufacturers.
* This marks the first time a fully North American mine-to-magnet supply chain for rare earth permanent magnets has been validated outside China, highlighting a new pathway for domestic rare earth materials to directly support the electric vehicle sector in major markets.
* With Energy Fuels’ U.S.-produced rare earth oxide now qualified for EV motors, we’ll assess how this breakthrough could influence the company’s growth outlook and supply chain positioning.

# Energy Fuels Investment Narrative Recap

Energy Fuels’ investment outlook centers on the thesis that demand for secure, non-Chinese rare earth supply chains will drive value for vertically integrated producers. The recent validation of its U.S.-sourced rare earths in electric vehicle magnets directly supports its positioning, but it does not fully resolve the ongoing constraint of limited feedstock access, currently the most important short-term catalyst and risk for the business.

Among the company’s recent announcements, the August 2025 update on dysprosium oxide production (at commercial-grade purity) is highly relevant. This advancement aligns with the current efforts at White Mesa Mill and may add further scale to Energy Fuels’ rare earth capabilities, reinforcing potential catalysts like offtake qualification.

**Energy Fuels' narrative projects $553.4 million revenue and $237.8 million earnings by 2028. This requires 104.1% yearly revenue growth and a $330.9 million earnings increase from the current earnings of -$93.1 million.**

**(That's a serious revenue increase from just Nd/Pr alone! Makes me wonder what NioCorp's Q-4 DFS will show??)**

Energy Fuels (NYSE-A: UUUU) (TSX: EFR) soared on Tuesday after receiving confirmation that its US mined and processed rare earth products are qualified for making permanent magnets used in electric vehicles and hybrid EVs.

In a press release, the Colorado-based company announced that its high-purity neodymium-praseodymium (NdPr) oxides have successfully been used by South Korea’s POSCO for the manufacturing of rare earth permanent magnets.

POSCO is a global leader in the manufacturing of traction motor cores used in EVs and hybrids, and the largest supplier in South Korea. Earlier this year, it [signed a memorandum of understanding](https://www.mining.com/energy-fuels-posco-team-up-to-explore-non-china-ree-magnet-supply-chain/) to process NdPr oxides supplied by Energy Fuels into metal, alloy and finished magnets to qualify for use in its traction motor cores.

For that, Energy Fuels has also confirmed that the NdPr oxides have passed all quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) benchmarks for EV drive unit motors sold to major automotive manufacturers across North America, the EU, Japan and Korea. Drive units powered by Energy Fuels’ NdPr oxides are expected to be installed in new vehicles and be available in the marketplace within the next few months, it added.

Energy Fuels said the 1.2 metric tonnes of NdPr oxide it supplied POSCO earlier this year were processed into approximately 3 metric tonnes of magnets, enough to power approximately 1,500 new vehicles.

“We are excited to announce that rare earth oxides mined, processed and produced in America are expected to be powering EVs and hybrids for sale around the world very soon, representing a major achievement in restoring domestic critical mineral supply chains,” stated Mark Chalmers, CEO of Energy Fuels.

“Commercial validation of our rare earth oxides at scale is a significant triumph for Energy Fuels, proving we have the capacity and expertise to produce rare earth materials that meet both commercial and defense requirements, at scale and to appropriate purity and performance specifications,” he added.

With the successful validation, the parties now plan to discuss a potential longer-term supply arrangement. These may include commercial-scale REE metallization, alloying and magnet production initiatives, as disclosed in their March MOU.

Following the announcement, Energy Fuels surged 13% to a new 52-week high of $13.46 in New York, sending its market capitalization above $3 billion. In Toronto, its stock also jumped nearly 14% for a C$4.2 billion market capitalization.

# US-produced rare earths

The successful production of rare earth permanent magnets from Energy Fuels’ NdPr oxides marks a decisive breakthrough in building a “mine-to-magnet” supply chain independent of China, the company said, emphasizing that its products are strictly produced in the US.

The NdPr oxides are produced at Energy Fuels’ White Mesa mill in Utah, the only licensed uranium mill in the US, with the added capability to produce other critical minerals such as rare earth elements. The rare earths are derived from monazite concentrates supplied by heavy mineral sands operations across Florida and Georgia.

In addition to producing neodymium and praseodymium, which are considered “light” rare earths, the White Mesa mill is also [piloting the production](https://www.mining.com/energy-fuels-soars-to-52-week-high-as-it-begins-heavy-rare-earth-production/) of the more in-demand “heavy” rare earths, starting with dysprosium — also a key ingredient in permanent magnets. First production of high-purity dysprosium oxide was [achieved last month](https://www.mining.com/energy-fuels-produces-first-heavy-rare-earth-oxides/).

“We plan to construct ‘heavy’ rare earth oxide capacity in 2026 at our White Mesa mill in Utah, thereby ‘closing the loop’ on this important non-China supply chain,” Chalmers said.

# 🏔️ THE BIG PICTURE: What is the Elk Creek Deposit, Really?

***1. Geologic Scale***  
At its core, Elk Creek sits on a 7 km² carbonatite complex, discovered by UNL geologists in the 1970s and later drilled by Molycorp in the ’80s. Back then, geos spoke of “megatonnes” of contained REEs with grades of 1–4% over long intercepts. Fast forward: **NioCorp’s 2022 Feasibility Study defined \~300 million tonnes of resources across only 60 acres — just 1% of the district footprint. That tiny slice alone equates to \~632,000 tonnes of TREO, plus huge Nb, Sc, and Ti credits.** With 2025 Pentagon-backed drilling now complete (≈12,000m, including 9 infill + 6 step-outs), **Elk Creek is ready to prove a much bigger ore body, open at depth and in two directions. Translation: what’s been measured is just the tip of a geologic iceberg, potentially rivaling Brazil’s Araxá (CBMM) or China’s Bayan Obo in sheer scale!!**

***2. Multi-Metal Arsenal***  
Unlike pure-play REE juniors, Elk Creek is polymetallic:

* **Niobium →** Superalloys, pipelines, EVs, MRI/fusion magnets. Could replace U.S. dependence on Brazil’s monopoly.
* **Scandium →** Elk Creek would be the #1 global source. Sc-Al alloys are transformational for aerospace, EVs, and DoD. Mark Smith confirmed a U.S. defense prime is already testing Sc-Al for Gen VI fighters. Even 100–200 t/y would reset global pricing.
* **Titanium (TiO₂ / TiCl₄) →** Dual markets. TiO₂ = pigment/industrial. TiCl₄ = feedstock for titanium alloys, armor, jets, missiles, and even smoke screen systems. Negotiations are underway with three major U.S. industrials + defense channels.
* **Rare Earths (Nd, Pr, Dy, Tb) →** High-value magnet elements critical for EVs, wind, and defense, not just low-value cerium/lanthanum bulk.

**This product mix acts like a risk shield —** if one market lags, others carry revenue. I**t’s why Elk Creek is called the “Saudi Arabia of Scandium” and a “buried Arsenal Metals Fortress” by those tracking defense metals.**

**3. Strategic & Economic Impact**  
**Scott Honan framed it best: “We’re incredibly passionate… we get up every morning anxious to make this thing happen.”** The project will need $1.2B in capex and \~400 new workers, but is designed with minimal footprint — environmental surveys have already allowed NioCorp to avoid wetlands and habitats. With local support secured, the social license is in hand. On the funding side, NioCorp is advancing a U.S. EXIM Bank loan, Pentagon Title III support ($10M already secured), and equity raises. If construction starts in 2026, Elk Creek could be producing by 2029 — delivering Nb, Sc, Ti, and REEs at scale.

# Big picture? Elk Creek isn’t just a mine. It’s America’s answer to Araxá and Bayan Obo — a multi-generational critical minerals district that could lock U.S. supply independence for decades.

***If the 2022 FS already justified \~$1B+/year revenue on just 1% of the deposit, the true district-scale Elk Creek could be a multi-billion-tonne, multi-billion-dollar fortress of U.S. strategic metals!   —  It brings a multi-commodity advantage. Niobium, Scandium, Titanium, and REEs that all stack together, creating a diversified output unmatched by single-metal REE juniors.***

# Even the USGS has gone on record: Elk Creek is “potentially one of the largest global resources of Niobium and rare earth elements!!!”

**IMHO\~** NioCorp is stepping into its most critical phase yet. Phase 1 drilling is complete with assays due mid-to-late October, **setting up a Q4 DFS that could reset the scale across scandium, niobium, titanium, and REEs. With 64% more core drilled than the 2022 FS, the potential for a massive resource upgrade is on the table!** Layer in Stellantis still engaged on REEs, titanium talks with three U.S. majors, and scandium demonstration projects with DoD & a Defense Prime targeting first metal by November — and Elk Creek is transforming from “future mine” to a cornerstone of U.S. strategic supply.

Tomorrow morning (6:15am EST), CEO Mark Smith joins **Maria Bartiromo on Fox Business**. Expect him to hammer home **NIOBIUM** as America’s “Sword of Damocles” risk, scandium as the Saudi Arabia of next-gen alloys, and how Elk Creek fits into the Pentagon’s push for critical minerals independence. With a confirmed defense prime already working on Sc-Al alloys for Gen VI fighters, and $10M of DoD Title III backing in hand, this story is no longer about potential — it’s about execution and national security.

**The timing couldn’t be sharper**: Washington just launched a $5B critical minerals fund, Trump’s administration is signaling support for price floors, and precedents like MP’s Pentagon-backed contracts show how fast rerates can happen. NioCorp sits perfectly in that lane — scandium supply chain creation, niobium and titanium as strategic anchors, and REEs as a kicker. Monday’s Maria appearance could be the spark that ignites the rerating rally heading into drill results, DFS, and financing.

At its core, this approach involves a quick, simple weight loss hack for busy people—combining an Ice Water Hack morning routine with the specialized Aqua Sculpt supplement. By chugging a glass of ice-cold water and taking a single capsule of Aqua Sculpt first thing each day, users claim they can boost metabolism with cold water and spark an extended thermogenic phase that burns more calories throughout the day.

If it sounds too easy, it might be because the method relies on basic physiology: the body doesn’t like being cold. When faced with chilled water, it ramps up energy expenditure to maintain core temperature, a principle known as cold-induced thermogenesis explained. But unlike drinking cold water alone (which offers only a fleeting bump in calorie burn), pairing that water with Aqua Sculpt ingredients can allegedly sustain your metabolism in “fat-burning mode” for hours. You may have heard similar pitches from other thermogenic supplements for weight loss**,** but Aqua Sculpt aims to stand out by delivering a balanced blend that fuels the body without harsh stimulants or crash dieting.

This first part of our comprehensive review on Aqua Sculpt will clarify how the Ice Water Hack interacts with your internal “fat furnace,” explore the fundamental science of brown fat activation, and highlight the unique synergy that may help you speed up fat burning naturally**—**all without upending your entire lifestyle. From chlorogenic acid weight loss effects to berberine blood sugar support, we’ll see why many label Aqua Sculpt vs. traditional diet pills as a major step forward. Let’s dive into the nitty-gritty and see whether this combination can genuinely transform your mornings—and your waistline.

What Is the 7-Second Ice Water Hack? (And Why Your Metabolism Loves Aqua Sculpt)

The Ice Water Hack is a super-simple routine: drink a glass of ice-cold water first thing in the morning with a little twist that maximizes its impact. Cold water on its own can jolt your metabolism – when you drink it, your body works to raise the water to body temperature, burning extra calories in the process. You might even feel a shiver; that’s your body activating heat production. This hack takes that a step further by introducing Aqua Sculpt’s thermogenic nutrients at the same time, creating a synergy that keeps your metabolism running in high gear for hours.

When you perform the Ice Water Hack, here’s what happens inside your body:

* **Aqua sculpt and Instant Thermogenic Activation:** The sudden drop in temperature from the ice water shocks your system awake. Think of it as a wake-up call for your metabolism. Your body responds by firing up a process called cold-induced thermogenesis – essentially, it starts burning calories to generate heat and restore your normal core temperature. This means even at rest, you’re using more energy than you otherwise would. *(In fact, researchers have noted that drinking cold water can boost metabolic rate within minutes, although the effect by itself lasts only a short while.)*
* **Brown Fat to the Rescue:** We all have two types of fat – white fat (the kind that stores calories and forms love handles or belly fat) and brown fat (a calorie-burning fat that generates heat). Cold exposure is one of the few ways to activate brown fat. The Ice Water Hack stimulates brown adipose tissue, causing it to burn more calories for warmth​. This process not only helps you shed fat but also releases heat that further keeps your metabolism revved up. Essentially, you’re telling your body to turn fat into fuel every morning.
* **Extended Fat-Burning Window:** Normally, any boost from cold water alone might last roughly 30 minutes before your body equilibrates. But when you add Aqua Sculpt’s specialized nutrients (more on those soon), the fat-burning window is dramatically extended – often to several hours at a time. Instead of your metabolism slowing back down after your morning coffee, it stays elevated for the better part of the day, burning significantly more calories *even while you go about your routine*. This is key: the hack isn’t about spending extra hours at the gym, it’s about making the hours you’re not at the gym work in your favor.
* **Effortless and Easy to Incorporate:** Perhaps the best part of the Ice Water Hack is how **easy** it is. It literally takes only a few seconds to do (hence “7-second hack”) – no complicated procedures or timing multiple pills a day. You drink a cold glass of water and take Aqua Sculpt in the morning, and you’re done. It slots right into your morning routine (you can do it before or alongside brushing your teeth!). Unlike elaborate diets or fasting protocols, this hack doesn’t leave you feeling deprived or change your whole schedule. It’s a tiny habit with a big payoff.

Many people also find this ritual invigorating. That cold splash inside wakes you up more naturally than a cup of coffee, and knowing that you’ve jumpstarted your metabolism gives a motivational boost to kick off your day on a healthy note. In summary, the Ice Water Hack is a quick morning habit that uses thermogenesis (your body’s heat-producing, calorie-burning response) to set the stage for *accelerated fat loss*. And the secret weapon that makes this hack so effective is the Aqua Sculpt formula you take with that cold water.

The Science Behind the Ice Water Hack & Aqua Sculpt

Understanding the science of thermogenesis is key to appreciating how the Ice Water Hack and Aqua Sculpt work together.

How Cold-Induced Thermogenesis Works

When you drink ice-cold water, your body has to expend energy (calories) to bring the water to body temperature. This process, known as cold-induced thermogenesis, can increase your metabolic rate by 5–15% for a brief period. However, on its own, this boost is temporary—typically lasting about 30 minutes.

How Aqua Sculpt Extends the Effect

Aqua Sculpt contains a blend of natural, scientifically validated ingredients that work to extend and intensify the thermogenic response:

* It maintains an elevated metabolic rate for several hours.
* It enhances the conversion of stored fat into energy.
* It supports overall cellular energy production. 

The result is an extended fat-burning window—ensuring that even after your morning cold water has warmed up, your metabolism remains in high gear.

Why Thermogenesis Is Essential for Weight Loss

Traditional weight-loss approaches often focus solely on reducing calorie intake or increasing physical activity. While these methods are important, they overlook the benefits of a continuously active metabolism. By boosting thermogenesis, the Ice Water Hack with Aqua Sculpt not only increases calorie burn but also encourages your body to use fat as fuel rather than storing it. This dual approach helps break through weight-loss plateaus and leads to more sustainable fat loss over time.

Inside Aqua Sculpt: Key Ingredients and Their Fat-Burning Roles

While many weight-loss products tout “proprietary blends,” Aqua Sculpt explicitly details its components, making it easier for consumers to evaluate:

1. Chlorogenic Acid Weight Loss: Sourced largely from green coffee bean extract benefits, chlorogenic acid may reduce carb absorption and stabilize insulin levels, thus helping maintain fat-burning phases.
2. L-Carnitine for Fat Burning: This amino acid derivative transports fatty acids into the mitochondria, especially beneficial when combined with the *shock* from cold water.
3. Green Tea Extract Thermogenic (EGCG): EGCG can raise resting metabolic rate and improve fat oxidation, often called out as a potent “mild” thermogenic that pairs well with moderate caffeine.
4. Berberine Blood Sugar Support: By activating AMPK, berberine can encourage your cells to use more sugar and fat for energy, limiting how much new fat you store.
5. Chromium Appetite Control: A trace mineral that helps modulate insulin response, thus reducing spikes and crashes that lead to snacking.
6. Cayenne Pepper Extract (Capsaicin): Sparks internal heat production, boosting calorie use. Also can curb hunger.
7. Alpha Lipoic Acid for Metabolism: Assists in balancing blood sugar and helps the body more efficiently convert food into usable energy, reducing the likelihood of fat storage.
8. Milk Thistle Liver Support: Supports liver health and detoxification, essential for optimal fat metabolism.
9. L-Theanine Calm Energy: Works synergistically with mild stimulants to provide focus without the jitters. 

This layered formula aims to attack weight loss from multiple angles—blood sugar control, appetite suppression, fat transport, and direct thermogenesis—rather than relying on just one trick. It’s why the brand bills Aqua Sculpt as more than your average diet pill.

How to Use the Aqua Sculpt (Step-by-Step)

One of the best parts of this regimen is how simple it is to follow. Here’s a straightforward guide to implementing the 7-second Ice Water Hack each day:

1. **Prep a Glass of Ice-Cold Water:** Each morning, right after you wake up (and ideally before breakfast), fill a glass with ice and water. About 8-12 ounces (250-300 ml) of chilled water is perfect. Some people prefer to prepare it the night before (e.g., keep a glass or bottle in the fridge) so it’s ready to go. The water should be very cold – the “ice water” is key to jolting your metabolism awake. *Tip:* For an extra kick, you can squeeze a bit of fresh lemon juice into the water. Lemon adds a refreshing flavor and a dose of vitamin C, which can support metabolism and digestion. A tiny pinch of baking soda is an optional addition some use to make the water alkaline; while not necessary, it can aid hydration and digestion for some people. These add-ons are optional – plain icy water works great on its own, too.
2. **Take One Aqua Sculpt Capsule with the Water:** This step is the core of the hack – it literally takes about 7 seconds. Swallow one capsule of Aqua Sculpt with your glass of ice water. Aqua Sculpt is designed to be taken on an empty stomach in the morning for best results (so it can start working on your metabolism right away). The cold water will help dissolve the capsule and deliver the nutrients quickly into your system. If you’re not a fan of swallowing capsules, you can open the capsule and mix its contents in the cold water – the taste is mild because it’s largely herbal, but chasing it with a bit more water or a squeeze of lemon can help. As you drink that cold water down, imagine it waking up every cell in your body and Aqua Sculpt’s ingredients spreading that warmth and energy from within.
3. **Continue with Your Day – No Elaborate Rituals Required:** That’s it for the hack itself! Carry on with your morning as you normally would – whether that’s having a healthy breakfast, getting ready for work, etc. Aqua Sculpt will begin to take effect within minutes, and you’ll likely feel a subtle increase in alertness or warmth as thermogenesis kicks in. You don’t need to change your routine drastically. Eat normal, balanced meals when you’re hungry (many find they naturally prefer healthier foods as mentioned). Importantly, no special diet is mandated – the hack will boost your calorie burn regardless. Of course, pairing it with nutritious foods will amplify results, but even if you’re not perfect, the hack has your back. Similarly, you don’t have to start an extreme workout program. Stay active in ways you enjoy (even a walk or some stretches), but Aqua Sculpt is helping you burn calories *even when you’re not working out*. Many people with busy schedules love this aspect: the hack works in the background, torching calories while you go about your obligations.
4. **Be Consistent – Daily Repetition is Key:** The Ice Water Hack works best when done consistently every morning. It’s like lighting that internal furnace each day; the more reliably you do it, the more your body adapts to keep the fire burning. If possible, try not to skip days. It helps to keep your Aqua Sculpt bottle and a water glass by your bedside or in a visible spot as a reminder. Some users set a phone alarm titled “Ice Water Hack” to ring when they wake up. The habit itself is simple, but making it automatic will ensure you get maximum benefit. Dr. Blaine often tells participants: it’s like *“waking up your body’s metabolism engine”*. If you do it every day, your engine stays tuned and revved. If you skip, the engine might start to idle slower again. Most people find it easy to make this a habit because it’s so quick and they feel good doing it – it’s not like forcing down a bad shake or doing a 5 AM workout; it’s refreshing.
5. **Stay Hydrated and Consider Additional Hacks (Optional):** Throughout the day, keep drinking water regularly (doesn’t have to be ice-cold every time, but staying well-hydrated supports metabolism and curbs excess hunger). Some enthusiasts do a second round of the Ice Water Hack in the afternoon – i.e., another cold glass and Aqua Sculpt capsule – especially if they have a second dose available and want an extra metabolism boost (note: follow the product instructions on daily dosage; if it’s intended as one capsule per day, stick with that unless otherwise directed). However, Aqua Sculpt’s formula is potent enough that once a day is generally sufficient and recommended. Gentle movement after meals (a 10-minute walk) can further help your thermogenic momentum, though it’s not required. The beauty of the hack is that *the heavy lifting is done by your metabolism, not by you*. 

By following these steps, you’ll be executing the Ice Water Hack correctly. It truly is that simple – hydrate, take Aqua Sculpt, and let science do the rest. Most users report that they start noticing subtle changes within the first week (like a bit more energy or slightly looser clothes), with more significant weight loss results typically showing after 2-4 weeks of consistency. We’ll touch on typical results in a moment, but first, let’s ensure you know how to get your hands on the authentic Aqua Sculpt formula, since its availability is somewhat exclusive.

Where to Get Aqua Sculpt – Securing the Official Formula

**Aqua Sculpt is exclusively available through its Official Website.** To maintain quality control and ensure customers get the genuine product (with the exact ingredients and dosages that make the Ice Water Hack effective), the makers of Aqua Sculpt have opted not to sell it in general stores or other websites. This means you won’t find the legitimate Aqua Sculpt on Amazon, eBay, or your local pharmacy. If you do see it listed elsewhere, it’s likely a counterfeit or unauthorized seller, and those bottles might not have the real formula (or valid money-back guarantee).

To **start the Ice Water Hack safely**, follow these steps to get Aqua Sculpt from the right source:

1. **Visit the Official Aqua Sculpt Website:** The easiest way is to go to the official Ice Water Hack page – you can access it by clicking the link provided by the company (for example, on their press releases or ads). For convenience: *simply search for “Official Aqua Sculpt Ice Water Hack”* and ensure the URL you click on looks official (typically it will be the manufacturer’s site). On this site, you’ll find detailed info, customer testimonials, and often special deals that aren’t available elsewhere.
2. **Choose Your Package:** Once on the site, you’ll usually have a few package options to choose from, depending on your needs and budget. Common offerings are:
   * **1 Bottle (30-day supply):** Ideal if you just want to try it out. Priced around **$69** per bottle (plus shipping).
   * **3 Bottle Package (90 days):** A popular choice as it gives enough time to really see results. This package often comes at a discounted rate per bottle (for example, around **$59 each**, totaling about $177) and sometimes includes **free shipping** or a bonus.
   * **6 Bottle Package (180 days):** Best value for those committed to the full transformation journey.

What Is the 7-Second Ice Water Hack? (And Why Your Metabolism Loves Aqua Sculpt)

The Ice Water Hack is a super-simple routine: drink a glass of ice-cold water first thing in the morning with a little twist that maximizes its impact. Cold water on its own can jolt your metabolism – when you drink it, your body works to raise the water to body temperature, burning extra calories in the process. You might even feel a shiver; that’s your body activating heat production. This hack takes that a step further by introducing Aqua Sculpt’s thermogenic nutrients at the same time, creating a synergy that keeps your metabolism running in high gear for hours.

When you perform the Ice Water Hack, here’s what happens inside your body:

* **Aqua sculpt and Instant Thermogenic Activation:** The sudden drop in temperature from the ice water shocks your system awake. Think of it as a wake-up call for your metabolism. Your body responds by firing up a process called cold-induced thermogenesis – essentially, it starts burning calories to generate heat and restore your normal core temperature. This means even at rest, you’re using more energy than you otherwise would. *(In fact, researchers have noted that drinking cold water can boost metabolic rate within minutes, although the effect by itself lasts only a short while.)*
* **Brown Fat to the Rescue:** We all have two types of fat – white fat (the kind that stores calories and forms love handles or belly fat) and brown fat (a calorie-burning fat that generates heat). Cold exposure is one of the few ways to activate brown fat. The Ice Water Hack stimulates brown adipose tissue, causing it to burn more calories for warmth​. This process not only helps you shed fat but also releases heat that further keeps your metabolism revved up. Essentially, you’re telling your body to turn fat into fuel every morning.
* **Extended Fat-Burning Window:** Normally, any boost from cold water alone might last roughly 30 minutes before your body equilibrates. But when you add Aqua Sculpt’s specialized nutrients (more on those soon), the fat-burning window is dramatically extended – often to several hours at a time. Instead of your metabolism slowing back down after your morning coffee, it stays elevated for the better part of the day, burning significantly more calories *even while you go about your routine*. This is key: the hack isn’t about spending extra hours at the gym, it’s about making the hours you’re not at the gym work in your favor.
* **Effortless and Easy to Incorporate:** Perhaps the best part of the Ice Water Hack is how **easy** it is. It literally takes only a few seconds to do (hence “7-second hack”) – no complicated procedures or timing multiple pills a day. You drink a cold glass of water and take Aqua Sculpt in the morning, and you’re done. It slots right into your morning routine (you can do it before or alongside brushing your teeth!). Unlike elaborate diets or fasting protocols, this hack doesn’t leave you feeling deprived or change your whole schedule. It’s a tiny habit with a big payoff.

Many people also find this ritual invigorating. That cold splash inside wakes you up more naturally than a cup of coffee, and knowing that you’ve jumpstarted your metabolism gives a motivational boost to kick off your day on a healthy note. In summary, the Ice Water Hack is a quick morning habit that uses thermogenesis (your body’s heat-producing, calorie-burning response) to set the stage for *accelerated fat loss*. And the secret weapon that makes this hack so effective is the Aqua Sculpt formula you take with that cold water.

The Science Behind the Ice Water Hack & Aqua Sculpt

Understanding the science of thermogenesis is key to appreciating how the Ice Water Hack and Aqua Sculpt work together.

How Cold-Induced Thermogenesis Works

When you drink ice-cold water, your body has to expend energy (calories) to bring the water to body temperature. This process, known as cold-induced thermogenesis, can increase your metabolic rate by 5–15% for a brief period. However, on its own, this boost is temporary—typically lasting about 30 minutes.

How Aqua Sculpt Extends the Effect

Aqua Sculpt contains a blend of natural, scientifically validated ingredients that work to extend and intensify the thermogenic response:

* It maintains an elevated metabolic rate for several hours.
* It enhances the conversion of stored fat into energy.
* It supports overall cellular energy production. 

The result is an extended fat-burning window—ensuring that even after your morning cold water has warmed up, your metabolism remains in high gear.

Why Thermogenesis Is Essential for Weight Loss

Traditional weight-loss approaches often focus solely on reducing calorie intake or increasing physical activity. While these methods are important, they overlook the benefits of a continuously active metabolism. By boosting thermogenesis, the Ice Water Hack with Aqua Sculpt not only increases calorie burn but also encourages your body to use fat as fuel rather than storing it. This dual approach helps break through weight-loss plateaus and leads to more sustainable fat loss over time.

Inside Aqua Sculpt: Key Ingredients and Their Fat-Burning Roles

While many weight-loss products tout “proprietary blends,” Aqua Sculpt explicitly details its components, making it easier for consumers to evaluate:

1. Chlorogenic Acid Weight Loss: Sourced largely from green coffee bean extract benefits, chlorogenic acid may reduce carb absorption and stabilize insulin levels, thus helping maintain fat-burning phases.
2. L-Carnitine for Fat Burning: This amino acid derivative transports fatty acids into the mitochondria, especially beneficial when combined with the *shock* from cold water.
3. Green Tea Extract Thermogenic (EGCG): EGCG can raise resting metabolic rate and improve fat oxidation, often called out as a potent “mild” thermogenic that pairs well with moderate caffeine.
4. Berberine Blood Sugar Support: By activating AMPK, berberine can encourage your cells to use more sugar and fat for energy, limiting how much new fat you store.
5. Chromium Appetite Control: A trace mineral that helps modulate insulin response, thus reducing spikes and crashes that lead to snacking.
6. Cayenne Pepper Extract (Capsaicin): Sparks internal heat production, boosting calorie use. Also can curb hunger.
7. Alpha Lipoic Acid for Metabolism: Assists in balancing blood sugar and helps the body more efficiently convert food into usable energy, reducing the likelihood of fat storage.
8. Milk Thistle Liver Support: Supports liver health and detoxification, essential for optimal fat metabolism.
9. L-Theanine Calm Energy: Works synergistically with mild stimulants to provide focus without the jitters. 

This layered formula aims to attack weight loss from multiple angles—blood sugar control, appetite suppression, fat transport, and direct thermogenesis—rather than relying on just one trick. It’s why the brand bills Aqua Sculpt as more than your average diet pill.

How to Use the Aqua Sculpt (Step-by-Step)

One of the best parts of this regimen is how simple it is to follow. Here’s a straightforward guide to implementing the 7-second Ice Water Hack each day:

1. **Prep a Glass of Ice-Cold Water:** Each morning, right after you wake up (and ideally before breakfast), fill a glass with ice and water. About 8-12 ounces (250-300 ml) of chilled water is perfect. Some people prefer to prepare it the night before (e.g., keep a glass or bottle in the fridge) so it’s ready to go. The water should be very cold – the “ice water” is key to jolting your metabolism awake. *Tip:* For an extra kick, you can squeeze a bit of fresh lemon juice into the water. Lemon adds a refreshing flavor and a dose of vitamin C, which can support metabolism and digestion. A tiny pinch of baking soda is an optional addition some use to make the water alkaline; while not necessary, it can aid hydration and digestion for some people. These add-ons are optional – plain icy water works great on its own, too.
2. **Take One Aqua Sculpt Capsule with the Water:** This step is the core of the hack – it literally takes about 7 seconds. Swallow one capsule of Aqua Sculpt with your glass of ice water. Aqua Sculpt is designed to be taken on an empty stomach in the morning for best results (so it can start working on your metabolism right away). The cold water will help dissolve the capsule and deliver the nutrients quickly into your system. If you’re not a fan of swallowing capsules, you can open the capsule and mix its contents in the cold water – the taste is mild because it’s largely herbal, but chasing it with a bit more water or a squeeze of lemon can help. As you drink that cold water down, imagine it waking up every cell in your body and Aqua Sculpt’s ingredients spreading that warmth and energy from within.
3. **Continue with Your Day – No Elaborate Rituals Required:** That’s it for the hack itself! Carry on with your morning as you normally would – whether that’s having a healthy breakfast, getting ready for work, etc. Aqua Sculpt will begin to take effect within minutes, and you’ll likely feel a subtle increase in alertness or warmth as thermogenesis kicks in. You don’t need to change your routine drastically. Eat normal, balanced meals when you’re hungry (many find they naturally prefer healthier foods as mentioned). Importantly, no special diet is mandated – the hack will boost your calorie burn regardless. Of course, pairing it with nutritious foods will amplify results, but even if you’re not perfect, the hack has your back. Similarly, you don’t have to start an extreme workout program. Stay active in ways you enjoy (even a walk or some stretches), but Aqua Sculpt is helping you burn calories *even when you’re not working out*. Many people with busy schedules love this aspect: the hack works in the background, torching calories while you go about your obligations.
4. **Be Consistent – Daily Repetition is Key:** The Ice Water Hack works best when done consistently every morning. It’s like lighting that internal furnace each day; the more reliably you do it, the more your body adapts to keep the fire burning. If possible, try not to skip days. It helps to keep your Aqua Sculpt bottle and a water glass by your bedside or in a visible spot as a reminder. Some users set a phone alarm titled “Ice Water Hack” to ring when they wake up. The habit itself is simple, but making it automatic will ensure you get maximum benefit. Dr. Blaine often tells participants: it’s like *“waking up your body’s metabolism engine”*. If you do it every day, your engine stays tuned and revved. If you skip, the engine might start to idle slower again. Most people find it easy to make this a habit because it’s so quick and they feel good doing it – it’s not like forcing down a bad shake or doing a 5 AM workout; it’s refreshing.
5. **Stay Hydrated and Consider Additional Hacks (Optional):** Throughout the day, keep drinking water regularly (doesn’t have to be ice-cold every time, but staying well-hydrated supports metabolism and curbs excess hunger). Some enthusiasts do a second round of the Ice Water Hack in the afternoon – i.e., another cold glass and Aqua Sculpt capsule – especially if they have a second dose available and want an extra metabolism boost (note: follow the product instructions on daily dosage; if it’s intended as one capsule per day, stick with that unless otherwise directed). However, Aqua Sculpt’s formula is potent enough that once a day is generally sufficient and recommended. Gentle movement after meals (a 10-minute walk) can further help your thermogenic momentum, though it’s not required. The beauty of the hack is that *the heavy lifting is done by your metabolism, not by you*. 

By following these steps, you’ll be executing the Ice Water Hack correctly. It truly is that simple – hydrate, take Aqua Sculpt, and let science do the rest. Most users report that they start noticing subtle changes within the first week (like a bit more energy or slightly looser clothes), with more significant weight loss results typically showing after 2-4 weeks of consistency. We’ll touch on typical results in a moment, but first, let’s ensure you know how to get your hands on the authentic Aqua Sculpt formula, since its availability is somewhat exclusive.

Where to Get Aqua Sculpt – Securing the Official Formula

**Aqua Sculpt is exclusively available through its Official Website.** To maintain quality control and ensure customers get the genuine product (with the exact ingredients and dosages that make the Ice Water Hack effective), the makers of Aqua Sculpt have opted not to sell it in general stores or other websites. This means you won’t find the legitimate Aqua Sculpt on Amazon, eBay, or your local pharmacy. If you do see it listed elsewhere, it’s likely a counterfeit or unauthorized seller, and those bottles might not have the real formula (or valid money-back guarantee).

What Is the 7-Second Ice Water Hack? (And Why Your Metabolism Loves Aqua Sculpt)

The Ice Water Hack is a super-simple routine: drink a glass of ice-cold water first thing in the morning with a little twist that maximizes its impact. Cold water on its own can jolt your metabolism – when you drink it, your body works to raise the water to body temperature, burning extra calories in the process. You might even feel a shiver; that’s your body activating heat production. This hack takes that a step further by introducing Aqua Sculpt’s thermogenic nutrients at the same time, creating a synergy that keeps your metabolism running in high gear for hours.

When you perform the Ice Water Hack, here’s what happens inside your body:

* **Aqua sculpt and Instant Thermogenic Activation:** The sudden drop in temperature from the ice water shocks your system awake. Think of it as a wake-up call for your metabolism. Your body responds by firing up a process called cold-induced thermogenesis – essentially, it starts burning calories to generate heat and restore your normal core temperature. This means even at rest, you’re using more energy than you otherwise would. *(In fact, researchers have noted that drinking cold water can boost metabolic rate within minutes, although the effect by itself lasts only a short while.)*
* **Brown Fat to the Rescue:** We all have two types of fat – white fat (the kind that stores calories and forms love handles or belly fat) and brown fat (a calorie-burning fat that generates heat). Cold exposure is one of the few ways to activate brown fat. The Ice Water Hack stimulates brown adipose tissue, causing it to burn more calories for warmth​. This process not only helps you shed fat but also releases heat that further keeps your metabolism revved up. Essentially, you’re telling your body to turn fat into fuel every morning.
* **Extended Fat-Burning Window:** Normally, any boost from cold water alone might last roughly 30 minutes before your body equilibrates. But when you add Aqua Sculpt’s specialized nutrients (more on those soon), the fat-burning window is dramatically extended – often to several hours at a time. Instead of your metabolism slowing back down after your morning coffee, it stays elevated for the better part of the day, burning significantly more calories *even while you go about your routine*. This is key: the hack isn’t about spending extra hours at the gym, it’s about making the hours you’re not at the gym work in your favor.
* **Effortless and Easy to Incorporate:** Perhaps the best part of the Ice Water Hack is how **easy** it is. It literally takes only a few seconds to do (hence “7-second hack”) – no complicated procedures or timing multiple pills a day. You drink a cold glass of water and take Aqua Sculpt in the morning, and you’re done. It slots right into your morning routine (you can do it before or alongside brushing your teeth!). Unlike elaborate diets or fasting protocols, this hack doesn’t leave you feeling deprived or change your whole schedule. It’s a tiny habit with a big payoff.

Many people also find this ritual invigorating. That cold splash inside wakes you up more naturally than a cup of coffee, and knowing that you’ve jumpstarted your metabolism gives a motivational boost to kick off your day on a healthy note. In summary, the Ice Water Hack is a quick morning habit that uses thermogenesis (your body’s heat-producing, calorie-burning response) to set the stage for *accelerated fat loss*. And the secret weapon that makes this hack so effective is the Aqua Sculpt formula you take with that cold water.

The Science Behind the Ice Water Hack & Aqua Sculpt

Understanding the science of thermogenesis is key to appreciating how the Ice Water Hack and Aqua Sculpt work together.

How Cold-Induced Thermogenesis Works

When you drink ice-cold water, your body has to expend energy (calories) to bring the water to body temperature. This process, known as cold-induced thermogenesis, can increase your metabolic rate by 5–15% for a brief period. However, on its own, this boost is temporary—typically lasting about 30 minutes.

How Aqua Sculpt Extends the Effect

Aqua Sculpt contains a blend of natural, scientifically validated ingredients that work to extend and intensify the thermogenic response:

* It maintains an elevated metabolic rate for several hours.
* It enhances the conversion of stored fat into energy.
* It supports overall cellular energy production. 

The result is an extended fat-burning window—ensuring that even after your morning cold water has warmed up, your metabolism remains in high gear.

Why Thermogenesis Is Essential for Weight Loss

Traditional weight-loss approaches often focus solely on reducing calorie intake or increasing physical activity. While these methods are important, they overlook the benefits of a continuously active metabolism. By boosting thermogenesis, the Ice Water Hack with Aqua Sculpt not only increases calorie burn but also encourages your body to use fat as fuel rather than storing it. This dual approach helps break through weight-loss plateaus and leads to more sustainable fat loss over time.

Inside Aqua Sculpt: Key Ingredients and Their Fat-Burning Roles

While many weight-loss products tout “proprietary blends,” Aqua Sculpt explicitly details its components, making it easier for consumers to evaluate:

1. Chlorogenic Acid Weight Loss: Sourced largely from green coffee bean extract benefits, chlorogenic acid may reduce carb absorption and stabilize insulin levels, thus helping maintain fat-burning phases.
2. L-Carnitine for Fat Burning: This amino acid derivative transports fatty acids into the mitochondria, especially beneficial when combined with the *shock* from cold water.
3. Green Tea Extract Thermogenic (EGCG): EGCG can raise resting metabolic rate and improve fat oxidation, often called out as a potent “mild” thermogenic that pairs well with moderate caffeine.
4. Berberine Blood Sugar Support: By activating AMPK, berberine can encourage your cells to use more sugar and fat for energy, limiting how much new fat you store.
5. Chromium Appetite Control: A trace mineral that helps modulate insulin response, thus reducing spikes and crashes that lead to snacking.
6. Cayenne Pepper Extract (Capsaicin): Sparks internal heat production, boosting calorie use. Also can curb hunger.
7. Alpha Lipoic Acid for Metabolism: Assists in balancing blood sugar and helps the body more efficiently convert food into usable energy, reducing the likelihood of fat storage.
8. Milk Thistle Liver Support: Supports liver health and detoxification, essential for optimal fat metabolism.
9. L-Theanine Calm Energy: Works synergistically with mild stimulants to provide focus without the jitters. 

This layered formula aims to attack weight loss from multiple angles—blood sugar control, appetite suppression, fat transport, and direct thermogenesis—rather than relying on just one trick. It’s why the brand bills Aqua Sculpt as more than your average diet pill.

How to Use the Aqua Sculpt (Step-by-Step)

One of the best parts of this regimen is how simple it is to follow. Here’s a straightforward guide to implementing the 7-second Ice Water Hack each day:

1. **Prep a Glass of Ice-Cold Water:** Each morning, right after you wake up (and ideally before breakfast), fill a glass with ice and water. About 8-12 ounces (250-300 ml) of chilled water is perfect. Some people prefer to prepare it the night before (e.g., keep a glass or bottle in the fridge) so it’s ready to go. The water should be very cold – the “ice water” is key to jolting your metabolism awake. *Tip:* For an extra kick, you can squeeze a bit of fresh lemon juice into the water. Lemon adds a refreshing flavor and a dose of vitamin C, which can support metabolism and digestion. A tiny pinch of baking soda is an optional addition some use to make the water alkaline; while not necessary, it can aid hydration and digestion for some people. These add-ons are optional – plain icy water works great on its own, too.
2. **Take One Aqua Sculpt Capsule with the Water:** This step is the core of the hack – it literally takes about 7 seconds. Swallow one capsule of Aqua Sculpt with your glass of ice water. Aqua Sculpt is designed to be taken on an empty stomach in the morning for best results (so it can start working on your metabolism right away). The cold water will help dissolve the capsule and deliver the nutrients quickly into your system. If you’re not a fan of swallowing capsules, you can open the capsule and mix its contents in the cold water – the taste is mild because it’s largely herbal, but chasing it with a bit more water or a squeeze of lemon can help. As you drink that cold water down, imagine it waking up every cell in your body and Aqua Sculpt’s ingredients spreading that warmth and energy from within.
3. **Continue with Your Day – No Elaborate Rituals Required:** That’s it for the hack itself! Carry on with your morning as you normally would – whether that’s having a healthy breakfast, getting ready for work, etc. Aqua Sculpt will begin to take effect within minutes, and you’ll likely feel a subtle increase in alertness or warmth as thermogenesis kicks in. You don’t need to change your routine drastically. Eat normal, balanced meals when you’re hungry (many find they naturally prefer healthier foods as mentioned). Importantly, no special diet is mandated – the hack will boost your calorie burn regardless. Of course, pairing it with nutritious foods will amplify results, but even if you’re not perfect, the hack has your back. Similarly, you don’t have to start an extreme workout program. Stay active in ways you enjoy (even a walk or some stretches), but Aqua Sculpt is helping you burn calories *even when you’re not working out*. Many people with busy schedules love this aspect: the hack works in the background, torching calories while you go about your obligations.
4. **Be Consistent – Daily Repetition is Key:** The Ice Water Hack works best when done consistently every morning. It’s like lighting that internal furnace each day; the more reliably you do it, the more your body adapts to keep the fire burning. If possible, try not to skip days. It helps to keep your Aqua Sculpt bottle and a water glass by your bedside or in a visible spot as a reminder. Some users set a phone alarm titled “Ice Water Hack” to ring when they wake up. The habit itself is simple, but making it automatic will ensure you get maximum benefit. Dr. Blaine often tells participants: it’s like *“waking up your body’s metabolism engine”*. If you do it every day, your engine stays tuned and revved. If you skip, the engine might start to idle slower again. Most people find it easy to make this a habit because it’s so quick and they feel good doing it – it’s not like forcing down a bad shake or doing a 5 AM workout; it’s refreshing.
5. **Stay Hydrated and Consider Additional Hacks (Optional):** Throughout the day, keep drinking water regularly (doesn’t have to be ice-cold every time, but staying well-hydrated supports metabolism and curbs excess hunger). Some enthusiasts do a second round of the Ice Water Hack in the afternoon – i.e., another cold glass and Aqua Sculpt capsule – especially if they have a second dose available and want an extra metabolism boost (note: follow the product instructions on daily dosage; if it’s intended as one capsule per day, stick with that unless otherwise directed). However, Aqua Sculpt’s formula is potent enough that once a day is generally sufficient and recommended. Gentle movement after meals (a 10-minute walk) can further help your thermogenic momentum, though it’s not required. The beauty of the hack is that *the heavy lifting is done by your metabolism, not by you*. 

By following these steps, you’ll be executing the Ice Water Hack correctly. It truly is that simple – hydrate, take Aqua Sculpt, and let science do the rest. Most users report that they start noticing subtle changes within the first week (like a bit more energy or slightly looser clothes), with more significant weight loss results typically showing after 2-4 weeks of consistency. We’ll touch on typical results in a moment, but first, let’s ensure you know how to get your hands on the authentic Aqua Sculpt formula, since its availability is somewhat exclusive.

Where to Get Aqua Sculpt – Securing the Official Formula

**Aqua Sculpt is exclusively available through its Official Website.** To maintain quality control and ensure customers get the genuine product (with the exact ingredients and dosages that make the Ice Water Hack effective), the makers of Aqua Sculpt have opted not to sell it in general stores or other websites. This means you won’t find the legitimate Aqua Sculpt on Amazon, eBay, or your local pharmacy. If you do see it listed elsewhere, it’s likely a counterfeit or unauthorized seller, and those bottles might not have the real formula (or valid money-back guarantee).

What Is the 7-Second Ice Water Hack? (And Why Your Metabolism Loves Aqua Sculpt)

The Ice Water Hack is a super-simple routine: drink a glass of ice-cold water first thing in the morning with a little twist that maximizes its impact. Cold water on its own can jolt your metabolism – when you drink it, your body works to raise the water to body temperature, burning extra calories in the process. You might even feel a shiver; that’s your body activating heat production. This hack takes that a step further by introducing Aqua Sculpt’s thermogenic nutrients at the same time, creating a synergy that keeps your metabolism running in high gear for hours.

When you perform the Ice Water Hack, here’s what happens inside your body:

* **Aqua sculpt and Instant Thermogenic Activation:** The sudden drop in temperature from the ice water shocks your system awake. Think of it as a wake-up call for your metabolism. Your body responds by firing up a process called cold-induced thermogenesis – essentially, it starts burning calories to generate heat and restore your normal core temperature. This means even at rest, you’re using more energy than you otherwise would. *(In fact, researchers have noted that drinking cold water can boost metabolic rate within minutes, although the effect by itself lasts only a short while.)*
* **Brown Fat to the Rescue:** We all have two types of fat – white fat (the kind that stores calories and forms love handles or belly fat) and brown fat (a calorie-burning fat that generates heat). Cold exposure is one of the few ways to activate brown fat. The Ice Water Hack stimulates brown adipose tissue, causing it to burn more calories for warmth​. This process not only helps you shed fat but also releases heat that further keeps your metabolism revved up. Essentially, you’re telling your body to turn fat into fuel every morning.
* **Extended Fat-Burning Window:** Normally, any boost from cold water alone might last roughly 30 minutes before your body equilibrates. But when you add Aqua Sculpt’s specialized nutrients (more on those soon), the fat-burning window is dramatically extended – often to several hours at a time. Instead of your metabolism slowing back down after your morning coffee, it stays elevated for the better part of the day, burning significantly more calories *even while you go about your routine*. This is key: the hack isn’t about spending extra hours at the gym, it’s about making the hours you’re not at the gym work in your favor.
* **Effortless and Easy to Incorporate:** Perhaps the best part of the Ice Water Hack is how **easy** it is. It literally takes only a few seconds to do (hence “7-second hack”) – no complicated procedures or timing multiple pills a day. You drink a cold glass of water and take Aqua Sculpt in the morning, and you’re done. It slots right into your morning routine (you can do it before or alongside brushing your teeth!). Unlike elaborate diets or fasting protocols, this hack doesn’t leave you feeling deprived or change your whole schedule. It’s a tiny habit with a big payoff.

Many people also find this ritual invigorating. That cold splash inside wakes you up more naturally than a cup of coffee, and knowing that you’ve jumpstarted your metabolism gives a motivational boost to kick off your day on a healthy note. In summary, the Ice Water Hack is a quick morning habit that uses thermogenesis (your body’s heat-producing, calorie-burning response) to set the stage for *accelerated fat loss*. And the secret weapon that makes this hack so effective is the Aqua Sculpt formula you take with that cold water.

The Science Behind the Ice Water Hack & Aqua Sculpt

Understanding the science of thermogenesis is key to appreciating how the Ice Water Hack and Aqua Sculpt work together.

How Cold-Induced Thermogenesis Works

When you drink ice-cold water, your body has to expend energy (calories) to bring the water to body temperature. This process, known as cold-induced thermogenesis, can increase your metabolic rate by 5–15% for a brief period. However, on its own, this boost is temporary—typically lasting about 30 minutes.

How Aqua Sculpt Extends the Effect

Aqua Sculpt contains a blend of natural, scientifically validated ingredients that work to extend and intensify the thermogenic response:

* It maintains an elevated metabolic rate for several hours.
* It enhances the conversion of stored fat into energy.
* It supports overall cellular energy production. 

The result is an extended fat-burning window—ensuring that even after your morning cold water has warmed up, your metabolism remains in high gear.

Why Thermogenesis Is Essential for Weight Loss

Traditional weight-loss approaches often focus solely on reducing calorie intake or increasing physical activity. While these methods are important, they overlook the benefits of a continuously active metabolism. By boosting thermogenesis, the Ice Water Hack with Aqua Sculpt not only increases calorie burn but also encourages your body to use fat as fuel rather than storing it. This dual approach helps break through weight-loss plateaus and leads to more sustainable fat loss over time.

Inside Aqua Sculpt: Key Ingredients and Their Fat-Burning Roles

While many weight-loss products tout “proprietary blends,” Aqua Sculpt explicitly details its components, making it easier for consumers to evaluate:

1. Chlorogenic Acid Weight Loss: Sourced largely from green coffee bean extract benefits, chlorogenic acid may reduce carb absorption and stabilize insulin levels, thus helping maintain fat-burning phases.
2. L-Carnitine for Fat Burning: This amino acid derivative transports fatty acids into the mitochondria, especially beneficial when combined with the *shock* from cold water.
3. Green Tea Extract Thermogenic (EGCG): EGCG can raise resting metabolic rate and improve fat oxidation, often called out as a potent “mild” thermogenic that pairs well with moderate caffeine.
4. Berberine Blood Sugar Support: By activating AMPK, berberine can encourage your cells to use more sugar and fat for energy, limiting how much new fat you store.
5. Chromium Appetite Control: A trace mineral that helps modulate insulin response, thus reducing spikes and crashes that lead to snacking.
6. Cayenne Pepper Extract (Capsaicin): Sparks internal heat production, boosting calorie use. Also can curb hunger.
7. Alpha Lipoic Acid for Metabolism: Assists in balancing blood sugar and helps the body more efficiently convert food into usable energy, reducing the likelihood of fat storage.
8. Milk Thistle Liver Support: Supports liver health and detoxification, essential for optimal fat metabolism.
9. L-Theanine Calm Energy: Works synergistically with mild stimulants to provide focus without the jitters. 

This layered formula aims to attack weight loss from multiple angles—blood sugar control, appetite suppression, fat transport, and direct thermogenesis—rather than relying on just one trick. It’s why the brand bills Aqua Sculpt as more than your average diet pill.

How to Use the Aqua Sculpt (Step-by-Step)

One of the best parts of this regimen is how simple it is to follow. Here’s a straightforward guide to implementing the 7-second Ice Water Hack each day:

1. **Prep a Glass of Ice-Cold Water:** Each morning, right after you wake up (and ideally before breakfast), fill a glass with ice and water. About 8-12 ounces (250-300 ml) of chilled water is perfect. Some people prefer to prepare it the night before (e.g., keep a glass or bottle in the fridge) so it’s ready to go. The water should be very cold – the “ice water” is key to jolting your metabolism awake. *Tip:* For an extra kick, you can squeeze a bit of fresh lemon juice into the water. Lemon adds a refreshing flavor and a dose of vitamin C, which can support metabolism and digestion. A tiny pinch of baking soda is an optional addition some use to make the water alkaline; while not necessary, it can aid hydration and digestion for some people. These add-ons are optional – plain icy water works great on its own, too.
2. **Take One Aqua Sculpt Capsule with the Water:** This step is the core of the hack – it literally takes about 7 seconds. Swallow one capsule of Aqua Sculpt with your glass of ice water. Aqua Sculpt is designed to be taken on an empty stomach in the morning for best results (so it can start working on your metabolism right away). The cold water will help dissolve the capsule and deliver the nutrients quickly into your system. If you’re not a fan of swallowing capsules, you can open the capsule and mix its contents in the cold water – the taste is mild because it’s largely herbal, but chasing it with a bit more water or a squeeze of lemon can help. As you drink that cold water down, imagine it waking up every cell in your body and Aqua Sculpt’s ingredients spreading that warmth and energy from within.
3. **Continue with Your Day – No Elaborate Rituals Required:** That’s it for the hack itself! Carry on with your morning as you normally would – whether that’s having a healthy breakfast, getting ready for work, etc. Aqua Sculpt will begin to take effect within minutes, and you’ll likely feel a subtle increase in alertness or warmth as thermogenesis kicks in. You don’t need to change your routine drastically. Eat normal, balanced meals when you’re hungry (many find they naturally prefer healthier foods as mentioned). Importantly, no special diet is mandated – the hack will boost your calorie burn regardless. Of course, pairing it with nutritious foods will amplify results, but even if you’re not perfect, the hack has your back. Similarly, you don’t have to start an extreme workout program. Stay active in ways you enjoy (even a walk or some stretches), but Aqua Sculpt is helping you burn calories *even when you’re not working out*. Many people with busy schedules love this aspect: the hack works in the background, torching calories while you go about your obligations.
4. **Be Consistent – Daily Repetition is Key:** The Ice Water Hack works best when done consistently every morning. It’s like lighting that internal furnace each day; the more reliably you do it, the more your body adapts to keep the fire burning. If possible, try not to skip days. It helps to keep your Aqua Sculpt bottle and a water glass by your bedside or in a visible spot as a reminder. Some users set a phone alarm titled “Ice Water Hack” to ring when they wake up. The habit itself is simple, but making it automatic will ensure you get maximum benefit. Dr. Blaine often tells participants: it’s like *“waking up your body’s metabolism engine”*. If you do it every day, your engine stays tuned and revved. If you skip, the engine might start to idle slower again. Most people find it easy to make this a habit because it’s so quick and they feel good doing it – it’s not like forcing down a bad shake or doing a 5 AM workout; it’s refreshing.
5. **Stay Hydrated and Consider Additional Hacks (Optional):** Throughout the day, keep drinking water regularly (doesn’t have to be ice-cold every time, but staying well-hydrated supports metabolism and curbs excess hunger). Some enthusiasts do a second round of the Ice Water Hack in the afternoon – i.e., another cold glass and Aqua Sculpt capsule – especially if they have a second dose available and want an extra metabolism boost (note: follow the product instructions on daily dosage; if it’s intended as one capsule per day, stick with that unless otherwise directed). However, Aqua Sculpt’s formula is potent enough that once a day is generally sufficient and recommended. Gentle movement after meals (a 10-minute walk) can further help your thermogenic momentum, though it’s not required. The beauty of the hack is that *the heavy lifting is done by your metabolism, not by you*. 

By following these steps, you’ll be executing the Ice Water Hack correctly. It truly is that simple – hydrate, take Aqua Sculpt, and let science do the rest. Most users report that they start noticing subtle changes within the first week (like a bit more energy or slightly looser clothes), with more significant weight loss results typically showing after 2-4 weeks of consistency. We’ll touch on typical results in a moment, but first, let’s ensure you know how to get your hands on the authentic Aqua Sculpt formula, since its availability is somewhat exclusive.

Where to Get Aqua Sculpt – Securing the Official Formula

**Aqua Sculpt is exclusively available through its Official Website.** To maintain quality control and ensure customers get the genuine product (with the exact ingredients and dosages that make the Ice Water Hack effective), the makers of Aqua Sculpt have opted not to sell it in general stores or other websites. This means you won’t find the legitimate Aqua Sculpt on Amazon, eBay, or your local pharmacy. If you do see it listed elsewhere, it’s likely a counterfeit or unauthorized seller, and those bottles might not have the real formula (or valid money-back guarantee).

To **start the Ice Water Hack safely**, follow these steps to get Aqua Sculpt from the right source:

1. **Visit the Official Aqua Sculpt Website:** The easiest way is to go to the official Ice Water Hack page – you can access it by clicking the link provided by the company (for example, on their press releases or ads). For convenience: *simply search for “Official Aqua Sculpt Ice Water Hack”* and ensure the URL you click on looks official (typically it will be the manufacturer’s site). On this site, you’ll find detailed info, customer testimonials, and often special deals that aren’t available elsewhere.
2. **Choose Your Package:** Once on the site, you’ll usually have a few package options to choose from, depending on your needs and budget. Common offerings are:
   * **1 Bottle (30-day supply):** Ideal if you just want to try it out. Priced around **$69** per bottle (plus shipping).
   * **3 Bottle Package (90 days):** A popular choice as it gives enough time to really see results. This package often comes at a discounted rate per bottle (for example, around **$59 each**, totaling about $177) and sometimes includes **free shipping** or a bonus.
   * **6 Bottle Package (180 days):** Best value for those committed to the full transformation journey. This usually has the lowest cost per bottle (around **$39 each**, roughly $234 for the bundle) and free shipping. Six months is a great timeframe for substantial weight loss (and many reach their goal well before then but keep a stock for maintenance or family members).",1,1758452749.0,YouTuber,0,1.0,False

At its core, this approach involves a quick, simple weight loss hack for busy people—combining an Ice Water Hack morning routine with the specialized Aqua Sculpt supplement. By chugging a glass of ice-cold water and taking a single capsule of Aqua Sculpt first thing each day, users claim they can boost metabolism with cold water and spark an extended thermogenic phase that burns more calories throughout the day.

If it sounds too easy, it might be because the method relies on basic physiology: the body doesn’t like being cold. When faced with chilled water, it ramps up energy expenditure to maintain core temperature, a principle known as cold-induced thermogenesis explained. But unlike drinking cold water alone (which offers only a fleeting bump in calorie burn), pairing that water with Aqua Sculpt ingredients can allegedly sustain your metabolism in “fat-burning mode” for hours. You may have heard similar pitches from other thermogenic supplements for weight loss**,** but Aqua Sculpt aims to stand out by delivering a balanced blend that fuels the body without harsh stimulants or crash dieting.

There were guys that kept getting close and I would move back, I guess he was watching from behind me, so he pulled me close back to my mom again. I looked at him, said thank you, then he kept initiating small convos after that. He would give me compliments and I would just laugh in a way like I didn’t believe it and say thank you. Lastly, he asked for my insta then took my number cuz he doesn’t use his insta. I normally don’t give my number out but idk what happened to me. I think that we’re from different countries and he really had no way of knowing anything about me (including my last name) unless I gave it to him appealed to me at first?

We’re both from different religions and countries so it was made clear that a long term commitment is impossible. He’s only here to complete his studies for 2 years then he’s going back to his country. I only date to marry and have never really been in serious relationship nor a relationship/situationship for that long (3+months). He’s only been in one serious relationship from when he was younger but they didn’t end up getting married.

We talked for 4 months straight like we were in constant contact over messages or calls. I would tell him we need to stop when he would ask to move up in the relationship but he kept coming back and I honestly would miss him so much that I would respond the second he texted after we would “end things.” I remember the first time we agreed to end it he didn’t reach out for 3 days and I literally felt like my soul had left my body, it was very painful. I’ve never felt so comfortable with someone, and the way he talked to me I would feel it in my body. He found me at a time where I was moving chapters in my life (moving out, new school, leaving work). I also have lost touch with my friends (my fault but they also weren’t real friends). I was very happy with my life though and the transition I was going to be making. However, he opened my heart, made me feel like I’m capable/worthy of loving and being loved, made me fall in love with love again. It was nice having someone care about me and being there for me. I felt like a little girl with him and he would treat me that way. I gave him so much of my thought and time though (I’m normally like that a giver to those i love and let in my life). Im either all in or nothing that’s why when i fall I fall hard ;/

After around first month, he would start arguments because he wanted more than just texting/calling he wanted to see me and I didn’t want that. He would say that he misses me and it’s normal everyone here goes out on dates… though this isn’t normal for his country especially. I was trying to protect both of us from creating memories that will eventually lead to heartache and I didn’t want the relationship to develop. I kept telling him I’m fine with just talking as friends but nothing more or else we can just end the relationship if he’s no longer happy (which is what we agreed to the first week after we found out the religious differences). He never saw me just as a friend and honestly I fell for him too(bcz his confidence when he asked for my number in person, his calmness, and the way he cared and was prioritizing me) but I didn’t want to be playing his heart and I would keep telling/reminding him like we both know this isn’t going anywhere…etc. not realizing how much it’ll hurt me too eventually. I didn’t want to get drifted after our feeling but unfortunately here I am

P.s. not out of arrogance but mostly everyone I see/meet make very positive remarks about me and my looks. So the issue is not that I lack in looks, confidence, education,… it’s just me and personal life circumstances that made me close up on myself. He also makes remarks about my “beauty” and physical appearance. Sometimes I feel like that’s the only reason that makes him treat me the way he does and why he “doesn’t want to lose me,” although he’ve said no and got upset when I insinuated that he likes me for my looks (although this is my worst nightmare bcz I’ve always wanted someone to see more in me like be drawn to something deeper than my looks). 

After the 4 months he went back to his country to see his family and the 1st month he would constantly contact me over txt. Towards the end of that 1st month he started txting me at the end of his day and he would just ask the same few questions and then would want to sleep. I started feeling a change in his eagerness/energy towards me like feeling neglected and I would tell him don’t feel obligated to talk to me out of habit or whatever only talk to me when you actually want to bcz I wasn’t feeling like he was reaching out out of eagerness to learn about my day or w/e. I was just missing him constantly and our old connection I guess. He started growing a bit distant like going a day without reaching out then couple days, etc. We had yet another argument and he said how he’s always been the one to reach out and stuff and I told him that it’s not true I also reached out a few times (but he’s at his family’s and I’m not sure of his circumstances there so I didn’t want to be bothering him) & let him know he never communicated this issue to me before. So after that I reached out and I let him know that I miss him a lot and we txtd for a bit then he went MIA for 2 1/2 hrs only to see that he posted a sc story. I got very upset, especially because I had really wanted to talk to him only to see him ignoring me straight up like that, and I blocked him. Removed block after week+. He tried txting. I ended it with a txt and wouldn’t respond after that. No contact for over a month, close to 2. I was going through a lot health wise. So I responded to his last text and he called me and I spent it talking about my issues and everything I was going through. So all his worries vanished ofcourse and I ended up not teaching him the lesson I wanted him to learn about ignoring me when I want to talk to him.

Now he’s in a different state for his school and he’s only growing more distant, it’s like he only wants to talk to me at his convenience but when I want to talk to him he’s never there (he knows this and summed it in his own words when I was telling him about what’s bothering me) so he knows exactly what he’s doing and what’s bothering me. The issue is he won’t let me be, he keeps reaching out when I try to end things and move on but he also doesn’t want any sort of responsibility or commitment it seems. He said when he’s not comfortable it shows on him and he doesn’t need to talk to me 24hrs that he loves his family but he doesn’t talk to them every day… when he used to take all my time and want to talk to me every minute. I responded with “ whatever, I don’t care” it’s not about talking 24hrs it’s about how it’s only at his convenience. I was lying though, I did want more communication from him, going over 2-3days of no communication was hurting me, he broke my heart, I didn’t want to ask someone I care about to talk to me, let alone the only person I actually like talking to and want to talk to, I felt belittled and I hadn’t even had asked him for more communication, I want it to come from him. He just said he hasn’t been comfortable since he got here blah blah but that his feelings are still the same regardless of communication and he’s still him. The distance after that 1st call (after having gone 1+ month without communication) was killing me again though, bcz it’s like all my feelings just came back right after I heard his voice and his support. I like miss him crazy I’ve never felt like this before it’s daunting/draining. I’m seriously in love with him and I just love hearing his voice.

Now, I’ve told him I’m going on a trip and can’t communicate with him for a month (since he’s been growing distant). I need to get back to myself and try to get him out of mind somehow. The longing for him has been affecting me though especially not having anything significant to take my mind off him. I don’t know what to do. Every day I feel like texting him that I love him. ChatGPT has been good at holding me back. He’s always on my mind. I really liked him being in my life but now knowing he’s not really there for me whenever or when I need him hurts because I was always there for him. Please let me know what y’all think about this or what I should do. It’s even worse that I can’t talk about him to anyone because our differences 
;( 
I was thinking of telling him I met someone over the trip and want to give him a chance hoping that will stop him from communicating or just keep telling him that I don’t want to talk if he reaches out again. Idk. 

*I didn’t keep him blocked bcz I don’t like to block anyone as in have unfinished business. I don’t like the idea of blocking someone forever I like to set things straight and move on. (Everything with him has been an exception though I normally 1000% stick to my decisions) 
I’ve met him twice after the concert, once over coffee cuz I had interview in his area and another he came to my city so we can say bye before his travel (he invited me for dinner but I paid (lmk if this was a mistake on my end)). ",2,1758452623.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

This happrned after what felt like a nevver-enidng string of cringey conversations and ghosters. 🙄

I matched with this guy who had an awesome sense of humor...definitdly a rare find, right? We started chattting, and I realized we clicked immediately. Like, we were finishing each ohter’s jokes! 🎤 He was kinda surprised too since, tbh, neither of us were particularly clicking with anyone else that week.

Turns out, we were both just looking for something chill, and after a couple of weeks, he suggests we meet up for coffee. I fgured, why not? Worst case, I end up with a funny story, right? Well, we met and it was like we'd known each other forever. We talked about everything from our shared love for cheesy 90s sitcoms to pondering life's absurdities. Classic. 👀

Now, we're like partners-in-crime for all things Netflix marathons and board games. It's knda amazing how a dating app helped me find someone who's become such a genuine part of my life.

1nmp0oo,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1nmp0oo/are_situationships_ever_worth_it/,Are situationships ever worth it?,"I (30F) had a 7 month situationship with a man (26) - he dumped me in the end because I asked for ""too much"". I suppose I kept hopeful he was just 'slow' to feel safe enough to express his emotions and show up for me, after all he promised we were on the same page. 

I'm currently grounding myself and being clear on my needs and boundaries before I date again, because he rudely made me question them often. This process has left me curious - has a situationship ever worked out for anyone? My story is detailed below for context (and for context I now with hindsight see how awful this situation was, but I want to know about what's 'right').

------

I matched a man on tinder and ghosted him (which was rude of me) after a week of talking because he never asked a question about me. Then we matched on bumble, he ghosted me after a few days chatting. Then we matched on tinder again and I said we better get out of this bad habit.

We go out for drinks, we get on. Then we go for drinks again, we still get on. Then this repeated again and again until I put a stop to it. This started my monthly 'crash outs' as he so politely called them.

-1 month in: I send a text saying I'm uncomfortable that we only go to mine and/or a bar, I need something else so I know I'm not getting played. We chat over drinks about it and he assures me he's a good guy. I circle back the next day saying try any other type of date, we go for a 30min walk next time (then to mine).

-2 months in: I send a text asking for more romance as it was very sex-dominant, no dates, no deep talk etc. we have our first (and only) coffee and we talk it out (then go back to mine). Result is it is unhealthy of me to have expectations on milestones (like him sleeping over, cooking for me etc.).

-3 months in: a friend notifies me that he's still on dating apps. I say we need to chat and we catch up for an ice cream where he says ""I almost cancelled on you"". We have an awkward chat where he says he sees me long term and dating multiple girls is hard (he doesn't use the term exclusive).

-4 months in: my birthday is coming up and I made a snarky retort to his attempt to just come over to mine for the 8283th time. We go out on an awkward date (to a bar). He comes to mine after and we talk. This time he makes me apologise for the fear I had about how he would treat me on my birthday. Day of birthday? Just a happy birthday text. Next day? He came out with me and my brother for a very fancy dinner he didn't have to pay for. No card. No flowers. Nothing for me, just that I had to acknowledge his bravery for meeting my brother.

-5 months in: I sent a text because I felt nothing had progressed (I'm still not a gf, his friends and family don't know I exist, we cancel plans last minute because he's rather just **** me, etc.). He comes over to talk and says I should just know he likes me because he comes to see me, so it's obvious. I apologise for having expectations.

-6 months in: I text him saying my mum wants you at her bday dinner but I know you won't want to come, so now I'm stuck. I ended up having to apologize to him for putting him in that spot when he isn't ready to meet my mum (6 months in........). Two weeks later I had to ask again and he said yes under the condition she doesn't grill him.

-7 months in: I text him that I'm feeling very down. He's made some snarky remarks, dodged my attempts at romance, and won't talk deeply. He asks what he can do to help and I say it would be nice if he was proactive in communicating how he truly felt about me. He says fine, we'll chat tomorrow afternoon but can't tell me if it will have a positive outcome. Shock, that made me anxious and send a text saying I feel so alone. He had never slept over, never made time during the days (every weekend he had to golf... Both days... All 18 holes...), never talked about the future, never asked me to be his girlfriend. And I was sick of waiting, I can't keep compromising for my own health.

Anywho that apparently showcased my past trauma and it was too much, I can't just appreciate what he does for me (what, cancel plans and make me question my worth?). So I apologise and he dumped me 🤙

Oh and guess who was on bumble within the hour of me breaking down in front of them? And then forced me to unfollow them on insta after saying we want to cheer each other on from the sidelines? What a guy!

Note: I'm happy and healing now. I do need to be careful because I'm quick to agree when someone points out what I can do better because I love growing as a soul and I'm not saying I was perfect in this. But that meant I always felt on the back foot with him. That isn't healthy and normal, I just have never been able to experience what it is to be loved to be able to understand what healthy is or should be.

Wondering if I can get some advice/perspective on my situation with my partner. 

TL;DR: Her and I are on a trip with my family (mom and dad, 2 sisters, and their partners) for the next week in another country and I am struggling to support her on my own, so I want to message her friend. 

Some background: she has a lot of totally fair and legitimate historical issues with my family and being excluded (as do I) but the point of this trip is to try and address them and feel more together. Unfortunately, this is only being validated by the trip so far - she doesn’t drink, she smokes weed which is legal where we are from but not here, and she doesn’t drink coffee but does have these caffeinated beverages from a store in our own country so she is totally cut out from her normal creature comforts that would regulate her emotions - as well as our dogs, who we had to leave at home. The other way she would regulate herself is by calling her best friend, who does such a good job with her in a way I cannot. 

Normally, I have a significant amount of respect for the independence of their relationship and have never in the 10 years of us dating messaged her about my partner but now that we are totally out of other ways to regulate her, I am tempted to do so - largely because this is going to be a great trip and I don’t want her missing out by being so sad and upset. I don’t have any specific ask for the friend like to back my side of an argument, but just to help calm her down and gain some perspective. 

Do you think this is fair or is this unfair to the friend and my partner? ",0,1758452184.0,relationship_advice,5,0.5,False

Chapter 1 Marriage, A Scam

Anneliese Claude's friend had claimed she saw Zacharias Shaw walking into a hotel with the other woman, the two of them acting far too close. 

Anneliese had simply laughed it off.

""That's got to be a mistake.""

Zacharias? Cheat on her? They had grown up side by side. Thirteen years of history, loyalty, and a bond so deep it felt unshakable.

Just last month, he had rented out the biggest digital screen in Oceaton for her birthday. His love declaration played on a loop for the entire city. That kind of devotion didn't just vanish.

Besides, they were trying to have a baby now.

She had just gotten her pre-pregnancy test results. Everything looked good. The second she saw the report, she headed straight to his office to share the good news.

She stepped out of the elevator that led straight to the top floor. But someone was already standing there, blocking her path.

""You can't be up here without an appointment!"" the girl snapped, her chin slightly lifted.

She wore a bright yellow dress. She looked young, sharp, and a little too confident. Her face seemed vaguely familiar.

She stood with both hands out, clearly trying to keep Anneliese from getting past.

""Coral, this is Ms. Claude. She's also Mr. Shaw's wife."" Jackie rushed over, his tone tight. ""Apologize.""

Coral looked stunned for a moment, then straightened her spine and said with a sugary tone, ""Good afternoon, Ms. Claude. I'm Coral Slenderidge. Mr. Shaw is sponsoring my studies.

""I'm lucky he let me intern here. I didn't get any message about a guest, so I followed procedure. I hope you understand.""

She sounded polite, but there was an edge in her voice. A quiet kind of challenge.

Anneliese didn't respond. Her eyes dropped to Coral's hands.

""Nice polish,"" she replied, flat and calm.

That dusty blue shimmer was the same shade she'd seen on Zacharias' pinky last night while they were cooking. She had asked about it. He said it was ink. 

She hadn't thought much of it then.

Now, Coral quickly tucked her hands behind her back. She turned her head slightly, but not fast enough.

Anneliese saw it.

A dark, deep mark was pressed into the skin behind her ear. A hickey. With faint bite marks around it.

She knew that spot. Zacharias always kissed her there.

He buried his face behind her ear when he couldn't hold back. His voice would get low, thick with want.

""Honey… when will you finally be ready? I want you so bad it hurts…""

Her body had been through so much. She had suffered serious damage years ago, and doctors told her getting pregnant would be nearly impossible.

Zacharias said he was allergic to condoms. They were always too busy, too tired. They had been married for two years, and still had never gone all the way.

Each time he went to cool off in the shower, she had felt torn—guilty, touched, and thankful.

So, when he asked for a baby, when he gently told her to quit her job and focus on her health, she agreed without hesitation.

For six months, she endured the endless checkups. But deep down, she had looked forward to it.

Tonight was supposed to be their real wedding night. She had even gone out and bought lingerie—something she would never normally wear.

But now she knew the truth. Zacharias hadn't been cherishing her. He had already gone to someone else for what she couldn't give.

Her friend's warning, her blind trust, everything hit her all at once like a brick to the chest.

She stood still as stone.

""Ms. Claude, Mr. Shaw is with Mr. White. You can go in,"" Jackie said softly as he pulled Coral aside.

Anneliese walked forward, her heels tapping steadily against the polished floor.

She reached the office door and pushed it open just enough to hear.

A man was speaking inside.

""Having a lookalike is fine, but keeping her so close is just asking for trouble. What if Anneliese finds out?""

It was Christopher White's voice.

Anneliese froze. Her fingers turned ice-cold against the doorknob. Zacharias' betrayal was real. And Christopher—her own brother—already knew.

Zacharias replied. His voice was low and calm, steady as always.

""Don't worry. Anne trusts me. She loves me. She's obedient. She won't leave. She's focused on getting pregnant. She won't notice a thing.""

Each word cut deeper than the last.

Christopher's voice returned. ""Let's not forget, Selina paid someone to hurt her. Anneliese got stabbed twice. Her uterus was nearly destroyed. Everyone in Oceaton knows she can't have kids.

""If you hadn't proposed, whisked her out of the country, and kept her happy, we wouldn't have had time to clean up after Selina.

""If Selina had gone to prison because of her, her life would've been over. You really went the extra mile for her.

""Selina's proud. She doesn't like competition. She's nothing like Anneliese. If she finds out you found a stand-in who looks just like her, she'll lose her mind.""

""It's just a fling. Selina's coming back soon. I'll get rid of the stand-in before then.""

""Alright. Just handle it right.""

Anneliese's hand trembled. Her legs felt weak. Her vision blurred as the pain crushed her chest.

It felt like her heart was being torn apart, like fingers were digging in, squeezing, ripping it into pieces. Her back curled from the weight of it. Her breath came short. Her knees nearly buckled under her.

She was the true daughter of the Whites, yet they didn't bring her home until she turned seventeen.

No matter how polite or thoughtful she was, no matter how hard she tried to please them, her parents and her older brothers always favored the fake—Selina White.

The only person who truly cared for her was Grandma.

When Anneliese turned eighteen, Grandma gave her the family's heirloom bracelet. Selina couldn't stand it. She cried and screamed nonstop until their parents gave her a fifty-million-dollar mansion just to calm her down.

Not long after that, Anneliese was heading home one night when a group of thugs cornered her.

They yanked her into a dark alley. She fought back with everything she had, but they stabbed her twice.

She lay there bleeding, her clothes soaked. When the attackers ran off, she crawled toward the street alone, dragging herself out of that alley for help.

She was rushed to the hospital, barely hanging on. The doctors almost had to take her uterus.

The story exploded online and on every news outlet.

""Did you hear? The real White daughter got gangbanged and lost her uterus!""

""She's useless now. Can’t have kids. She was already crude—now she's totally ruined. Who'd want her?""

""How many guys went at her? If I were her, I'd have jumped in a river by now.""

The mockery spread like wildfire. The shame never let up.

And through it all, Zacharias was the only one who stood by her side.

While the whole city tore her apart, he stepped forward and said he loved her.

Right after her eighteenth birthday, he got down on one knee and proposed in front of everyone.

He took her on a trip. He stayed close and helped her heal.

She had almost drowned as a child, and it was Zacharias who had jumped in to save her. After that, she stuck to him like a shadow.

She already had feelings for him, and after that, she gave him her heart completely. Even when her family disapproved, she stayed by his side. He had nothing, but she didn't care.

She worked with him through the hardest years—through the tiny basement they lived in, through all the sleepless nights. She didn't complain once. Two years later, they finally got married. Even after that, he stayed gentle. Their love stayed strong. They began planning for a baby.

Everything felt like a dream. Anneliese thought Zacharias was her light, her miracle, the beautiful answer to all the pain life had thrown her.

But then she saw the truth—Zacharias had always loved Selina.

That was why Coral's face had felt so familiar. She had that soft, fragile look Selina wore so well.

So, the love confession, the public proposal, the marriage—none of it was for Anneliese. It was all to shield Selina. To serve her. To protect her.

How noble of him.

And what did that make Anneliese?

A sacrifice for their love story? A stand-in for the girl they worshipped?

Should she thank them for wrapping her up in this pretty little lie?

A voice broke through from behind the door.

""Who's there?"" Zacharias spoke, his voice low and cold.

He pushed back from the desk and walked to the door, his eyes dark and sharp.

He flung the heavy doors open and looked around with a tense glare, but the hallway outside was empty.

His brow furrowed. Jackie came jogging down the corridor.

""Who just passed through here?"" Zacharias' voice was tight.

Jackie froze under his stare, unsure what had happened. 

He didn't dare lie. ""Mr. Shaw, the madam came by. She bumped into Coral. Looked like she got upset. You didn't see her?""

""Anneliese was here?"" Christopher stepped forward, his expression tightening.

Zacharias' jaw locked. A sudden unease shot through his chest. His tone turned cold.

""Check the security footage. Now.""

Chapter 2 Divorce And Goodbye

""What are you all standing around for?""

Her voice rang out from the terrace. Soft. Clear. Familiar.

Anneliese stepped through the glass doors with her phone in her hand.

Her eyes were calm. Her face gave nothing away.

Zacharias and Christopher exchanged a quick glance. Their shoulders relaxed. They knew how much Anneliese valued her family.

If she had heard what they said, she wouldn't be this quiet. She would have been sobbing, shouting, falling apart.

Zacharias smiled faintly and walked over to take her bag. ""It's nothing. Why didn't you come in right away?""

He looked sharp and effortlessly put-together, dressed in a dark gray bespoke suit that hugged his tall frame just right. His presence commanded attention, not because he tried, but because success had settled into his every move.

Clauderias Tech had skyrocketed in just a few years. Its value had passed ten billion, and Zacharias, not even twenty-seven, had already made a name for himself as one of the rising stars in Oceaton's tech scene.

There was something magnetic about him. That quiet confidence. That polished charm. He didn't need to chase anyone.

A little warmth, a soft smile, and most women folded easily.

Anneliese's hands were trembling. Her skin felt cold to the touch, but Zacharias didn't seem to notice at all when his hand brushed past hers.

What are you doing here, Anneliese? Why keep chasing something that's fake? Anneliese thought.

She forced a smile.

""I got a call. Thought I'd take it outside so I wouldn't interrupt you.""

Zacharias relaxed instantly.

Christopher, still stiff with impatience, didn't hold back

""If you're going to be a stay-at-home wife, then stay at home. Don't just show up here without notice. If you really have to come, book ahead. You're always careless. Your sister never acts like this.""

If it had been Selina, they would've welcomed her with open arms. No matter what she did, it was seen as thoughtful, graceful, perfect.

Anneliese kept her voice even. ""You're right.""

Christopher frowned. She used to talk back. She used to get defensive or do something dramatic just to prove she wasn't any less than Selina.

But now she didn't argue. She didn't say much at all.

That silence stung more than anything else. It made him feel like she didn't even see him.

He decided she was just being her usual pitiful self—dull and forgettable.

""You two haven't been home in a while,"" he added. ""Come back for dinner tomorrow. Mom and Dad need to talk to you both.""

Zacharias nodded. ""Alright. I'll bring Anne.""

Christopher turned and left without another glance.

Zacharias guided her into his office and closed the door behind them. He came up behind her and wrapped his arms around her waist.

""What's the occasion? Did my sweet wife miss me?"" he said with a soft laugh.

That familiar cedar scent clung to his skin. Anneliese pressed her hand lightly to his chest, her eyes falling on the bag he held.

Inside was the test result she'd picked up that morning. It showed she was finally healthy enough to try for a baby. But now, there was no point in bringing it up.

She leaned away without meaning to. Her body didn't lie.

Zacharias frowned slightly. ""What's going on with you?""

She lifted her head. Part of her wanted to slap him. She wanted to rip away the lies, to break the pretty mask he wore.

But violence wouldn't fix anything.

She needed to walk away, to leave the Whites behind, the truth about what Selina had done to her, and most of all, justice.

""Will I always be less than Selina?"" she asked.

Zacharias paused. So that was what she'd been holding in. He reached out and tapped her forehead. ""You don't need to compare yourself to her.""

The words sounded gentle, but they split down the middle. He might have meant that she was incomparable or that she didn't even come close.

Anneliese used to believe the first. Now, she knew better.

She saw clearly now. Zacharias was an expert at making emptiness sound sweet.

A knock echoed at the door. Coral stepped inside with two cups of coffee.

Anneliese moved away from Zacharias and sat on the couch.

Coral placed a cup on the table in front of her, then walked across the room and handed the second one to Zacharias.

""Here's your coffee, Mr. Shaw,"" she said softly.

As he reached for the cup, her fingers skimmed his palm. The gesture looked casual, but it wasn't. Her nails grazed lightly across his skin.

""Ms. Slenderidge, right?"" Anneliese said suddenly.

Coral froze. The room felt like it dropped in temperature. Zacharias' jaw tightened. His fingers gripped the coffee cup harder than before.

He looked at Anneliese, who gave him a slow, relaxed smile.

""I just want juice. The medicine I'm taking isn't great with caffeine. That's all. Why do you both look so nervous?""

Zacharias didn't hesitate. ""Go get her some juice.""

His voice was calm, but the warning behind it was clear. He didn't even need to raise his tone. The look in his eyes said enough.

Coral's face turned pale. She bit down on her lip and spoke quickly. ""I'm sorry, Madam. I'll bring you juice right away.""

She grabbed the coffee and rushed out, heels tapping across the marble floor as she disappeared through the door.

Anneliese watched her go, her eyes steady and unreadable. She didn't look away until Zacharias stepped into her line of sight and blocked it with his broad frame.

She gave a small smile. ""She can't even handle a simple drink order. Since when did you become so patient with interns?""

Zacharias' face relaxed.

A moment ago, he thought something was off. Now, hearing her talk like this, he decided she was just being petty. Just jealousy, nothing more.

He leaned over, one hand pressed against the couch's backrest. His voice turned playful.

""Getting jealous? She's a sponsored poor girl. She's still young and doesn't know any better. Why are you even bothered?""

Young? Anneliese thought.

Zacharias must have forgotten—Anneliese was only twenty-two herself. At eighteen, she was already standing beside him, helping him build everything from the ground up.

Back then, Clauderias Tech was nothing more than a tiny team of fewer than ten people.

She started as his assistant, worked long hours, solved endless problems, and by the time she resigned, she was heading the PR department on her own.

She remembered one time when a client humiliated her during a pitch. She had run off to cry alone in a stairwell. Zacharias had found her and told her something without a flicker of sympathy.

""Anneliese, you chose to step into the real world early. That means you better get used to being hit hard. No one's going to coddle your mistakes or moods.""

She used to think he was pushing her to grow. She thought maybe he cared in his own way.

Now she knew the truth. He had always known how to be kind—he just never chose to be kind to her.

...

When Anneliese stepped outside the building, the strength drained from her all at once. Her knees buckled, and she sank onto a bench near the curb.

She dropped her head into her hands, breath caught in her throat.

Her calm began to fall apart. Bit by bit, the hurt and anger took over, sinking into her chest like cold steel. Her heart, already cracked, felt like it was caving in.

The sun slipped lower. Faded light scattered through the gray sky. A chill breeze swept through the street, carrying fine raindrops that clung to her skin.

Dry leaves drifted down and scattered across the road. Cars rolled over them, grinding them into the wet pavement. They looked like everything she had clung to—love, family, pride—all crushed and dirty.

She didn't know how long she sat there, shaking. Her body trembled until it began to still.

She lifted her head and pulled out her phone.

She didn't hesitate as she tapped a number and held the phone to her ear. The call connected after one ring, but no words came out of her mouth.

A calm voice came through the line. ""Anneliese? I'm here.""

That sound hit something deep in her. Familiar, but distant.

Her chest tightened. ""George, I'm sorry to bother you this late. I just wanted to ask... can I still join the Project eVTOL research lab?""

Her voice was barely more than a whisper. Her cheeks flushed with shame. She had no idea if she even deserved to ask.

She had entered Astoria University at fifteen as a gifted aeronautical student.

By junior year, she had already made breakthroughs in sensor-fusion algorithms. Her designs helped drones avoid obstacles with higher accuracy and stability.

She used that research for wildfire detection. The drone she designed became one of the most advanced search-and-rescue models of its time. Even the professors had been blown away.

They filed a patent for her. They offered her a fast track into grad school. The department head took her on as his final disciple. Her future had been bright, solid, and already unfolding.

She even launched Superbflight Aviation with her senior classmates, a startup focused on lightweight aerial cameras.

But four years ago, she gave all of that up for Zacharias. She walked away from school, from the lab, from everything.

Her professor hadn't forgotten her.

Two years ago, he flew to Oceaton himself and personally invited her to join the eVTOL project. She said no again.

Now, she regretted it. All of it.

She bit her lip until she tasted blood, but George's voice remained just as warm. ""Of course. I told you, if you ever wanted to come back, we'd be ready. When can you come? I'll book your flight. Would tomorrow be too soon?""

Anneliese felt a strange warmth bloom in her chest. ""What about Professor...""

""Oh, come on. You know how he is. Just show up. Give him a surprise. Once he sees you, he'll forget whatever grudge he's holding. And if he doesn't, cook him dinner. If that doesn't work, cook him two.""

She laughed through her tears. ""I'll cook every day if I have to. I just need one month to sort out some things here. Is that okay?""

""Of course it is. We'll wait.""

""Thank you. Really.""

She ended the call and sat in silence. The weight pressing down on her chest finally lifted.

One month. She would get a divorce. She would leave this city. She would return to the life that was hers all along.

She looked up, her vision clear.

At that moment, a black Bentley passed by on the road.

The back window was cracked open. Inside, a young girl was straddling a man's lap. Her arms wrapped around him, and their kiss burned through the cold, as if autumn had nothing to do with them at all.

Chapter 3 Don't Even Think About It

If he had just turned his head, even for a second, he would've seen her—his wife, sitting alone at the edge of the sidewalk, drenched in the rain, shaking from the cold, her eyes completely empty.

However, he didn't.

He was too lost in the thrill. That young girl in his arms lit him up with something new. In that moment, he forgot he had a home, a wife, or a past.

Anneliese watched the car fade into the city's neon blur. Then, she stood.

She reached into her purse, pulled out the fertility report, and tore it apart piece by piece. Her fingers moved slow and steady. When she was done, she walked to a nearby trash bin and dropped the shreds in.

Then, she turned and walked the other way.

The night had deepened, and the misty rain still fell.

Even the busy business district had gone quiet.

At the corner, an old lady squatted on the curb. Her white hair clung to her skin under the streetlight, and rain misted across her thin coat. A few bunches of flowers rested by her feet.

Life was hard. Love meant nothing.

Anneliese slipped off her wedding ring. She stepped toward the old lady and gently took her hand. She placed the ring into her palm and folded her fingers over it.

""It's raining. You should go home.""

The old lady said nothing. Anneliese didn't wait for a reply. She turned and walked away.

…

Two minutes later, a black Phantom pulled up to the curb. The driver's door opened, and a man stepped out.

His leather shoes tapped the pavement, polished and narrow, catching the streetlight as he moved. His suit pants lifted slightly as he stepped forward, revealing dark socks and sharp, lean ankles.

He stood tall. His frame filled the sidewalk as he opened a black umbrella and walked straight to the old lady.

He reached down and steadied her as she tried to rise. Her voice wavered. ""Don't be upset, Jonathan. I didn't expect the rain. I'm still healthy. A little water doesn't bother me.""

She explained that she had left a concert. On the way back, her driver had accidentally knocked down a flower seller. He took the girl to the hospital, so she waited here since the company building was nearby. She figured her grandson, the workaholic, could come get her.

However, when she saw the chill in his eyes, her words slowed.

Suddenly, she remembered the ring. She fumbled to push it into his hand.

""A young woman gave this to me by mistake. She walked away before I could say anything. Quick, go after her! She went that way!""

She pointed toward the street.

Jonathan Fullbuster—the old lady's grandson—looked where she indicated and spotted a faint silhouette. A slim figure walked into the lights and fog, her form fading with each step.

""Get in the car.""

He helped his grandmother into the back seat. He turned up the heat, spread out a blanket, and waited until she was settled. Then he shut the door and took off after the girl.

His stride was steady, long, and determined. The figure ahead became clearer.

She walked at a calm pace, straight into the rain. Her mist-blue coat clung to her back, soaked clean through. Her waist looked small, almost fragile. She held herself upright. Her whole presence felt distant, as if nothing in this noisy world could touch her.

She turned the corner and disappeared into the night.

By the time Jonathan caught up, she was gone.

The long street stretched ahead, still and empty. Light reflected in the puddles, casting blurred shapes across the sidewalk. It felt like she had never been there at all.

…

Back in the car, the old lady leaned toward him. ""Well?""

""I didn't catch her.""

She scowled. ""You run an airline and pilot your own planes, and you couldn't catch one girl?""

""Grandma, your logic is a little off.""

""Don't get smart with me. I'm disappointed. That girl was beautiful and kind! Why didn't you show up five minutes earlier? You might've met her! You have no idea how perfect you two would be together!""

""She's married,"" he replied, holding up the ring. It looked like a wedding band.

The old lady didn't take it. She shoved it back toward him. ""So what? She took it off, didn't she? That means something. You'd better go find her and give it back.""

Jonathan turned the ring between his fingers.

The soft pink diamond caught the dim light and glimmered like a secret.

It feels weird… holding a stranger's wedding ring.

His grandmother stared him down.

He gave in and tossed the ring onto the center console and let out a quiet sigh.

A faint smile tugged at the edge of his lips. His sharp profile looked softer in the dark. ""Well, I appreciate your faith in me.""

""I don't care. That ring's worth at least a million. You're going to find that girl and return it. Got it?""

""Got it, Your Majesty.""

He answered without conviction, but his eyes still flicked to the ring. What a headache, he thought.

...

Anneliese didn't check her phone until she was in the back of the cab. Only then did she see the message Zacharias had sent two hours ago.

""Honey, something came up. Not coming home tonight. Sleep early.""

She didn't reply. She swiped away the pinned chat. Then she deleted the contact name ""Hubby"" and changed it to something else.

The bedroom looked like it had been staged for a photo shoot.

Roses covered the floor, their petals trailing from the doorway to the bed in a winding path of red.

Anneliese had dressed the bed in her favorite silk set, a soft shade of yellow that reminded her of buttercups in early spring.

She had gone all in. Every corner felt warm and full of promise.

But now, it felt like a cruel joke.

She stormed in and ripped the sheets off in one hard pull. Petals scattered across the floor, tumbling in every direction like confetti after a failed celebration.

…

The next morning, the doorbell kept ringing. The sound clawed at her skull. Her head throbbed, her temples pounding in sync with every buzz.

She forced herself downstairs and opened the door.

Jessica Sweeting stood there with fury all over her face. Before Anneliese could say a word, Jessica pulled her into a tight hug and started shouting.

""That j*rk! *sshole! He can forget about becoming the richest man now!

""He's got another woman in his heart, treats you like a stand-in, and still manages to fool everyone into thinking he's such a good guy. D*mn. That's some next-level manipulation.

""What storm drain did he crawl out of? Who let him loose to wreck people's lives?

""I swear, I hope he lives long enough to regret everything. May he stay infertile forever, and still have grandkids he doesn't deserve!""

Jessica's mouth didn't stop. Each curse came harder than the last.

Anneliese pulled her inside, guided her to the couch, and poured her a glass of water.

Jessica downed it in one long gulp. When she looked at Anneliese again, she noticed the dark circles under her eyes and the tired slump in her shoulders. She stopped yelling and dug through her bag for a stack of photos.

""Annie…""

""I'm fine. Just show me what you've got.""

Anneliese gave her a weak smile and took the pictures. She had tried to prepare herself. But the moment her eyes landed on the photos, her chest went tight.

Zacharias had Coral tucked away in a private villa just a few streets from his company.

They walked around together like a couple on vacation, bold and casual, with their hands locked like they had nothing to hide.

In one photo, taken just before dusk, Coral had her legs wrapped around his waist as he carried her into the villa. Her body pressed close. Her expression smug.

On her private social account, Coral showed off designer bags—bags identical to the ones Zacharias had given Anneliese.

In her latest post, Coral wore a diamond bracelet. Her fingers rested on a man's chest, her caption written like a claim—'His love is in the diamond. His heart is under my hand.'

Anneliese clenched the photo. Her knuckles went pale, and her eyes burned.

It wasn't about missing him. It wasn't even about heartbreak anymore.

It was about everything she had poured into a man who gave her back nothing but lies.

Jessica snatched the photos from her hand and hissed under her breath.

""Thank God you never slept with him. Or you'd be at the doctor by now. And even if everything came back clean, you'd still be sick just thinking about it.""

Anneliese gave a tired laugh. ""Yeah. Lucky me, right?""

She stood up and headed upstairs. A few minutes later, she returned with two big bags and dropped them at Jessica's feet.

""Help me sell all of it. And use the money to support some girls who actually need it. Someone who deserves a shot.""

The bags were full of expensive gifts—watches, perfumes, purses, and jewelry. Things Zacharias had given her over the years.

But packing them made her realize something. None of it had ever meant anything. It was just money. Thoughtless, effortless spending.

She used to treasure those things. Now she couldn't stand to look at them.

Why keep them, just to risk running into Coral wearing the same purse?

Jessica and Anneliese had grown up together in the same group home.

Jessica now ran a small hustle with two friends—part-time detectives, fake girlfriends, side-job specialists.

They did everything from catching cheaters to reselling luxury bags.

Anything for a price.

Jessica pulled the bags closer and gave a sharp whistle.

""Don't worry. I'll flip this stuff and find a few broke, hot high school guys to mentor. Let Zacharias know women can do the same d*mn thing.""

Sponsoring wasn't just a man's game.

Anneliese smiled and shook her head.

""No need. Let the stuff go to someone who needs it. Not every girl down on her luck turns into Coral. And Zacharias? He's garbage. But I'm not crawling in after him.""",1,1758452099.0,novelsfree,0,1.0,False
1nmoxlh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1nmoxlh/did_i_mess_up_that_bad/,Did I mess up that bad?,"So for the last 3 months me and my bf are going through a very rough patch. 

The backstory -  

We have been dating for almost 8 months now, things were going well in beginning later I feared that he has been hiding things from me, he has never made me meet his friends, whenever I ask him he would say they are not in town or its too early he likes to keep his relationship to himself it was not my intention to try to snoop into his friends group as it's my first relationship ever I thought things like this are pretty common. 

Later in July I saw him at a coffee place where me and my friend went, we've been there for hours and then I saw him walking with a girl which I had no idea off who she is I just saw her once in his followings and he never mentioned about her too me and it was very odd cause at the same day he told me he's not in town, he saw us and instead of coming inside he went away, when I called he said I'll call you back later in night I asked who was she? He told me she was a friend of friends and they just ""apparantly"" bumped into eachother, keep in mind he was not in town so when I asked did you lie that you were not here? He told me he had come back because his father had some work to do and he was visiting the shop to buy something which was right next the coffee shop we were in - I couldn't comprehend all of that and that girl won't leave my mind. 

Things were getting really weird bw us now to just know who she's actually I digged way too deep which later hurted me like hell - later I got to know she was in a trip which he went before meeting me and told me to my face that there was this just 3 people including him never mentioned her, when I asked he again said ""not a relevant person"". 

Later I got to know through someone else that she randomly goes on dates and does ONS ( not judging her choice )
But the thought of what I'm getting myself into was at high, I couldn't tell him this all about her as I didn't wanted to ruin someone's image, there wasn't any proof of her ONS but her dating story was wild additional information - she's also getting married which he told me later this year. 

Now 3 days ago I told him this all and expressed why I was feeling so insecure about her and why she has been a constant debate of our fights, he now tells me that he can't even hangout with his friends now and he has to keep this big thing hidden from the rest of them, he feels very blindsided, blamed me for doing all these enquiries. \

 I was miserable seeing her with him, I explained that all well too him, he understood took my word, I apologized for it, but wouldn't it be possible he could've known this from someone else too? Or he might actually know about this who knows? 

Idk what to do at this point and also he had told me that he will be away from town for 3 months to complete a requirement of the course he's studying but in the morning I was in his area and suspiciously his wifi got connected to my phone seeing that I went inside and saw his bike parked infront of the parking lot, I asked him are you still here? Told me no the wifi guy didn't took off the wifi yet his owner said he will have that happen ( he lived in a rented room which he emptied that's what he told me ) and about the bike he told me he asked his owner to let the bike be there he will collect it later on.

1nmowz7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1nmowz7/i_feel_so_lost_heres_my_story/,I feel so lost. Here's my story,"I broke up with my pwBPD of 2.5 years, four months ago. At first, I thought this breakup was just another one of the many cycles we had during our relationship – she had gone silent, ghosted me, gotten angry, and then reached out to me again 6-7 times before. After a month of ghosting, I texted her telling her I missed her very much. She replied saying she was in the process of seeing someone new and didn’t want me to confuse her. I insisted, and she told me she had a boyfriend, that she was living the best days of her life, and blamed me – saying we were not compatible, that I hated everyone, and that I kept her locked up at home. Then she blocked me, but I kept trying to reach her. Eventually, her mother called me and said that my ex was afraid of me and that I needed to leave her alone.

At that point, I stopped contacting her. Two weeks later, she called me and said she needed time, that she saw my efforts, that I needed to find a job and get my life together, that she would watch my actions, and if I improved myself she might ask me out for coffee in 1-2 months. She told me she was forgiving, that she even forgave her cheating ex-husband, and that she had a big heart. That gave me hope, so I found a job. Two weeks later, I saw that she had unblocked me on WhatsApp and was posting vacation photos with her friends in a way that I could see them — clearly for me to notice.

I called her, and this time she told me the exact opposite of what she had said before: that she didn’t love me, didn’t feel anything for me, that her phone had been broken, that she didn’t know how I saw those posts, that I should move on and build my own life, but also that we are human and nobody knows what the future holds — maybe she would call me one day, but right now she didn’t want me and couldn’t forgive me. Then she made very hurtful insults about my masculinity and worth. My first marriage had ended because I had been cheated on. She told me, “You are the kind of man who is perfect to cheat on — I could have cheated on you and you wouldn’t have even noticed.” She said, “I need a real man who can stand like a mountain behind me — you can’t even be a stone on that mountain, that’s your caliber.” These words hurt me deeply. Then she started crying, saying she was not okay, she was doing very badly, and that I needed to leave her alone. I accepted that and said goodbye.

After that, she texted me again. I replied briefly and neutrally. Then she called me again, this time drunk, and started swearing at me — insulting my ex-wife, my daughter (who lives with me), and even my other ex-girlfriend. She said she never even used the watch I had gifted her and that she would return it to me.

Two weeks later, I asked about her health and she replied with a very warm and detailed voice message, thanking me for thinking about her. Two weeks later, I texted her for her birthday. I told her I had found a job and was working now, that I was doing better. We had a short but warm and hopeful conversation. The next day I sent flowers to her workplace with a card that had the lyrics of our song’s chorus written on it. She texted me thanking me and saying she loved it.

That evening, I saw her car in front of a bar and waited for her to come out. She came out with another man, hugged him for a long time, and got into the same car with him. It was the most painful moment of my life. After all my efforts, after she had told me she saw them, after she had given me signals that there was still an emotional bond between us — she was also seeing someone else.

I followed them and they went to my ex’s house. I got out of my car and confronted her. Her new boyfriend was neither well-dressed nor good-looking. He was drunk, sloppy, and even smelled bad. I first wished her a happy birthday, then asked, “Is that your boyfriend?” She said, “Yes, I told you many times.” She had previously told me she had a boyfriend right after the breakup, but later admitted she had made that up just to keep me away and said she wasn’t seeing anyone. She later told me, “Yes, people text me, but I don’t want anyone in my life.”

While we were talking, her boyfriend came up and tried to push me away. I told him not to touch me. He was barely standing, too drunk to do anything. I didn’t want to cause a scene, so I turned back to my car. As I was leaving, I told my ex, “Shame on you.” Then I blocked her everywhere — but she didn’t block me.

Two days later, she changed her Instagram profile picture to one where she was wearing the watch I had given her (the one she said she never used). Three days later, I sent her a long and harsh message. I told her what she had put me through, that seeing her with another man that night felt like betrayal, that she would never be happy, and that life would teach her this lesson.

By this time, I had lost my health — both mentally and physically. I lost 10 kg, started urinating blood, and my hands and body started shaking. At this point, it had been 3 months since she had broken up with me (without telling me).

She replied to my message saying, “I’m sorry, you’re right, I don’t deserve to be happy.” Eight minutes later, she said, “But I didn’t cheat on you, we were broken up.” I told her that I was closing the book on her, that she didn’t even know the difference between cheating and emotional infidelity, and that she should never text me again. She then said, “See, even you are saying it — I am a terrible woman.” And then she said, “But I wondered about you, are you okay now?” I told her not to worry about me. She tried to call me, I didn’t answer, and told her I didn’t want to hear her voice or see her face. She said, “Fine, then we are done.” She again asked if I was okay. I didn’t reply and blocked her everywhere. This time, she also blocked me.

Then she changed her Instagram profile picture again — this time to a photo from the night I saw her with her boyfriend.

After that, I turned to ChatGPT to understand her behavior, and it suggested she might be a pwBPD. I started researching, and everything I found described her exactly. I read the book *I Hate You, Don’t Leave Me* — a phrase she literally said to me during our relationship. I had a moment of clarity and stopped blaming myself.

During our relationship, I never cheated, yelled, or insulted her. I always tried to solve her crises calmly. But when she drank, she would turn into another person. Her emotions changed very quickly. Last year, she confessed she had kissed another man. I forgave her. She told me it was “just a kiss” and even said the guy forced her. But now, I think it wasn’t just a kiss.

I told her mother that she was a pwBPD and that she needed therapy. Her mother aggressively blamed me — saying I broke her psychology, harassed her, and that she made the right choice by leaving me. She even threatened me. I only wanted to help because I was sad for her.

Out of sadness, I sent my ex an email telling her to ignore what I had said earlier and wishing her happiness. I also told her about my declining health.

Recently, she texted me again saying she had no bad feeling inside, that I shouldn’t worry, that my tests would be fine, that I should stay strong for my daughter and my mother. She thanked me for my good wishes.

It’s been a week since then and we haven’t had any communication. I still love her and miss her deeply. I have seen her in my dreams every night this past week. All day I wonder if she would ever come back, if I could convince her to get therapy, if we could be together again — or if she will be happy with her new relationship and marry him. I keep thinking if there is still some bond between us.

I’ve been watching A.J. Mahari’s podcasts and videos. At this point, I’ve realized I am codependent and have a trauma bond. My mind tells me to leave her behind and move on with my life, but my heart doesn’t let me.

During our relationship, I failed her only once — when her tire went flat, I couldn’t go because I was at physical therapy at the hospital. And the night of the breakup — she said she had forgotten her phone at work and was drinking — I didn’t go because I didn’t want a crisis to start while she was drunk. That was her reason for ending the relationship.

Other than that, I was always forgiving, calm, patient, and loving with her. Maybe I wasn’t as attentive and possessive as she wanted. Last year I retired and moved into a new house with my daughter. I had to give her more attention because she was 12 and I had missed most of her life due to my job. I even took her in because I thought her mother (my ex-wife) was a bad influence — she also shows BPD traits and has a history of impulsive and risky sexual relationships, even one with a woman.

Now I’m trying to meet someone new on Tinder and Bumble, but I can’t find anyone dateworthy. I get very few matches, and no conversation turns into a date. No woman seems as precious or beautiful as my ex pwBPD. She was different. Aside from her beauty, she was also a singer, played and taught piano, very social, and had 870 followers on Instagram.

When we met, she was very wounded. On our first date, she asked me what kind of woman I thought she was, and then cried while telling me her story. We got close very quickly — which fits the BPD pattern.

Right now, I don’t know what to do. I can’t afford therapy, and I only have one friend. I am introverted, 44 years old, and fully responsible for my daughter. I feel like my life ended with her. If I could win her back, I feel like I would come back to life too. When I go outside, every woman, every couple, every place reminds me of her. Last night I went to a mall with my daughter and suddenly felt suffocated, started crying, and went straight home.

Chapter 1 Marriage, A Scam

Anneliese Claude's friend had claimed she saw Zacharias Shaw walking into a hotel with the other woman, the two of them acting far too close. 

Anneliese had simply laughed it off.

""That's got to be a mistake.""

Zacharias? Cheat on her? They had grown up side by side. Thirteen years of history, loyalty, and a bond so deep it felt unshakable.

Just last month, he had rented out the biggest digital screen in Oceaton for her birthday. His love declaration played on a loop for the entire city. That kind of devotion didn't just vanish.

Besides, they were trying to have a baby now.

She had just gotten her pre-pregnancy test results. Everything looked good. The second she saw the report, she headed straight to his office to share the good news.

She stepped out of the elevator that led straight to the top floor. But someone was already standing there, blocking her path.

""You can't be up here without an appointment!"" the girl snapped, her chin slightly lifted.

She wore a bright yellow dress. She looked young, sharp, and a little too confident. Her face seemed vaguely familiar.

She stood with both hands out, clearly trying to keep Anneliese from getting past.

""Coral, this is Ms. Claude. She's also Mr. Shaw's wife."" Jackie rushed over, his tone tight. ""Apologize.""

Coral looked stunned for a moment, then straightened her spine and said with a sugary tone, ""Good afternoon, Ms. Claude. I'm Coral Slenderidge. Mr. Shaw is sponsoring my studies.

""I'm lucky he let me intern here. I didn't get any message about a guest, so I followed procedure. I hope you understand.""

She sounded polite, but there was an edge in her voice. A quiet kind of challenge.

Anneliese didn't respond. Her eyes dropped to Coral's hands.

""Nice polish,"" she replied, flat and calm.

That dusty blue shimmer was the same shade she'd seen on Zacharias' pinky last night while they were cooking. She had asked about it. He said it was ink. 

She hadn't thought much of it then.

Now, Coral quickly tucked her hands behind her back. She turned her head slightly, but not fast enough.

Anneliese saw it.

A dark, deep mark was pressed into the skin behind her ear. A hickey. With faint bite marks around it.

She knew that spot. Zacharias always kissed her there.

He buried his face behind her ear when he couldn't hold back. His voice would get low, thick with want.

""Honey… when will you finally be ready? I want you so bad it hurts…""

Her body had been through so much. She had suffered serious damage years ago, and doctors told her getting pregnant would be nearly impossible.

Zacharias said he was allergic to condoms. They were always too busy, too tired. They had been married for two years, and still had never gone all the way.

Each time he went to cool off in the shower, she had felt torn—guilty, touched, and thankful.

So, when he asked for a baby, when he gently told her to quit her job and focus on her health, she agreed without hesitation.

For six months, she endured the endless checkups. But deep down, she had looked forward to it.

Tonight was supposed to be their real wedding night. She had even gone out and bought lingerie—something she would never normally wear.

But now she knew the truth. Zacharias hadn't been cherishing her. He had already gone to someone else for what she couldn't give.

Her friend's warning, her blind trust, everything hit her all at once like a brick to the chest.

She stood still as stone.

""Ms. Claude, Mr. Shaw is with Mr. White. You can go in,"" Jackie said softly as he pulled Coral aside.

Anneliese walked forward, her heels tapping steadily against the polished floor.

She reached the office door and pushed it open just enough to hear.

A man was speaking inside.

""Having a lookalike is fine, but keeping her so close is just asking for trouble. What if Anneliese finds out?""

It was Christopher White's voice.

Anneliese froze. Her fingers turned ice-cold against the doorknob. Zacharias' betrayal was real. And Christopher—her own brother—already knew.

Zacharias replied. His voice was low and calm, steady as always.

""Don't worry. Anne trusts me. She loves me. She's obedient. She won't leave. She's focused on getting pregnant. She won't notice a thing.""

Each word cut deeper than the last.

Christopher's voice returned. ""Let's not forget, Selina paid someone to hurt her. Anneliese got stabbed twice. Her uterus was nearly destroyed. Everyone in Oceaton knows she can't have kids.

""If you hadn't proposed, whisked her out of the country, and kept her happy, we wouldn't have had time to clean up after Selina.

""If Selina had gone to prison because of her, her life would've been over. You really went the extra mile for her.

""Selina's proud. She doesn't like competition. She's nothing like Anneliese. If she finds out you found a stand-in who looks just like her, she'll lose her mind.""

""It's just a fling. Selina's coming back soon. I'll get rid of the stand-in before then.""

""Alright. Just handle it right.""

Anneliese's hand trembled. Her legs felt weak. Her vision blurred as the pain crushed her chest.

It felt like her heart was being torn apart, like fingers were digging in, squeezing, ripping it into pieces. Her back curled from the weight of it. Her breath came short. Her knees nearly buckled under her.

She was the true daughter of the Whites, yet they didn't bring her home until she turned seventeen.

No matter how polite or thoughtful she was, no matter how hard she tried to please them, her parents and her older brothers always favored the fake—Selina White.

The only person who truly cared for her was Grandma.

When Anneliese turned eighteen, Grandma gave her the family's heirloom bracelet. Selina couldn't stand it. She cried and screamed nonstop until their parents gave her a fifty-million-dollar mansion just to calm her down.

Not long after that, Anneliese was heading home one night when a group of thugs cornered her.

They yanked her into a dark alley. She fought back with everything she had, but they stabbed her twice.

She lay there bleeding, her clothes soaked. When the attackers ran off, she crawled toward the street alone, dragging herself out of that alley for help.

She was rushed to the hospital, barely hanging on. The doctors almost had to take her uterus.

The story exploded online and on every news outlet.

""Did you hear? The real White daughter got gangbanged and lost her uterus!""

""She's useless now. Can’t have kids. She was already crude—now she's totally ruined. Who'd want her?""

""How many guys went at her? If I were her, I'd have jumped in a river by now.""

The mockery spread like wildfire. The shame never let up.

And through it all, Zacharias was the only one who stood by her side.

While the whole city tore her apart, he stepped forward and said he loved her.

Right after her eighteenth birthday, he got down on one knee and proposed in front of everyone.

He took her on a trip. He stayed close and helped her heal.

She had almost drowned as a child, and it was Zacharias who had jumped in to save her. After that, she stuck to him like a shadow.

She already had feelings for him, and after that, she gave him her heart completely. Even when her family disapproved, she stayed by his side. He had nothing, but she didn't care.

She worked with him through the hardest years—through the tiny basement they lived in, through all the sleepless nights. She didn't complain once. Two years later, they finally got married. Even after that, he stayed gentle. Their love stayed strong. They began planning for a baby.

Everything felt like a dream. Anneliese thought Zacharias was her light, her miracle, the beautiful answer to all the pain life had thrown her.

But then she saw the truth—Zacharias had always loved Selina.

That was why Coral's face had felt so familiar. She had that soft, fragile look Selina wore so well.

So, the love confession, the public proposal, the marriage—none of it was for Anneliese. It was all to shield Selina. To serve her. To protect her.

How noble of him.

And what did that make Anneliese?

A sacrifice for their love story? A stand-in for the girl they worshipped?

Should she thank them for wrapping her up in this pretty little lie?

A voice broke through from behind the door.

""Who's there?"" Zacharias spoke, his voice low and cold.

He pushed back from the desk and walked to the door, his eyes dark and sharp.

He flung the heavy doors open and looked around with a tense glare, but the hallway outside was empty.

His brow furrowed. Jackie came jogging down the corridor.

""Who just passed through here?"" Zacharias' voice was tight.

Jackie froze under his stare, unsure what had happened. 

He didn't dare lie. ""Mr. Shaw, the madam came by. She bumped into Coral. Looked like she got upset. You didn't see her?""

""Anneliese was here?"" Christopher stepped forward, his expression tightening.

Zacharias' jaw locked. A sudden unease shot through his chest. His tone turned cold.

""Check the security footage. Now.""

Chapter 2 Divorce And Goodbye

""What are you all standing around for?""

Her voice rang out from the terrace. Soft. Clear. Familiar.

Anneliese stepped through the glass doors with her phone in her hand.

Her eyes were calm. Her face gave nothing away.

Zacharias and Christopher exchanged a quick glance. Their shoulders relaxed. They knew how much Anneliese valued her family.

If she had heard what they said, she wouldn't be this quiet. She would have been sobbing, shouting, falling apart.

Zacharias smiled faintly and walked over to take her bag. ""It's nothing. Why didn't you come in right away?""

He looked sharp and effortlessly put-together, dressed in a dark gray bespoke suit that hugged his tall frame just right. His presence commanded attention, not because he tried, but because success had settled into his every move.

Clauderias Tech had skyrocketed in just a few years. Its value had passed ten billion, and Zacharias, not even twenty-seven, had already made a name for himself as one of the rising stars in Oceaton's tech scene.

There was something magnetic about him. That quiet confidence. That polished charm. He didn't need to chase anyone.

A little warmth, a soft smile, and most women folded easily.

Anneliese's hands were trembling. Her skin felt cold to the touch, but Zacharias didn't seem to notice at all when his hand brushed past hers.

What are you doing here, Anneliese? Why keep chasing something that's fake? Anneliese thought.

She forced a smile.

""I got a call. Thought I'd take it outside so I wouldn't interrupt you.""

Zacharias relaxed instantly.

Christopher, still stiff with impatience, didn't hold back

""If you're going to be a stay-at-home wife, then stay at home. Don't just show up here without notice. If you really have to come, book ahead. You're always careless. Your sister never acts like this.""

If it had been Selina, they would've welcomed her with open arms. No matter what she did, it was seen as thoughtful, graceful, perfect.

Anneliese kept her voice even. ""You're right.""

Christopher frowned. She used to talk back. She used to get defensive or do something dramatic just to prove she wasn't any less than Selina.

But now she didn't argue. She didn't say much at all.

That silence stung more than anything else. It made him feel like she didn't even see him.

He decided she was just being her usual pitiful self—dull and forgettable.

""You two haven't been home in a while,"" he added. ""Come back for dinner tomorrow. Mom and Dad need to talk to you both.""

Zacharias nodded. ""Alright. I'll bring Anne.""

Christopher turned and left without another glance.

Zacharias guided her into his office and closed the door behind them. He came up behind her and wrapped his arms around her waist.

""What's the occasion? Did my sweet wife miss me?"" he said with a soft laugh.

That familiar cedar scent clung to his skin. Anneliese pressed her hand lightly to his chest, her eyes falling on the bag he held.

Inside was the test result she'd picked up that morning. It showed she was finally healthy enough to try for a baby. But now, there was no point in bringing it up.

She leaned away without meaning to. Her body didn't lie.

Zacharias frowned slightly. ""What's going on with you?""

She lifted her head. Part of her wanted to slap him. She wanted to rip away the lies, to break the pretty mask he wore.

But violence wouldn't fix anything.

She needed to walk away, to leave the Whites behind, the truth about what Selina had done to her, and most of all, justice.

""Will I always be less than Selina?"" she asked.

Zacharias paused. So that was what she'd been holding in. He reached out and tapped her forehead. ""You don't need to compare yourself to her.""

The words sounded gentle, but they split down the middle. He might have meant that she was incomparable or that she didn't even come close.

Anneliese used to believe the first. Now, she knew better.

She saw clearly now. Zacharias was an expert at making emptiness sound sweet.

A knock echoed at the door. Coral stepped inside with two cups of coffee.

Anneliese moved away from Zacharias and sat on the couch.

Coral placed a cup on the table in front of her, then walked across the room and handed the second one to Zacharias.

""Here's your coffee, Mr. Shaw,"" she said softly.

As he reached for the cup, her fingers skimmed his palm. The gesture looked casual, but it wasn't. Her nails grazed lightly across his skin.

""Ms. Slenderidge, right?"" Anneliese said suddenly.

Coral froze. The room felt like it dropped in temperature. Zacharias' jaw tightened. His fingers gripped the coffee cup harder than before.

He looked at Anneliese, who gave him a slow, relaxed smile.

""I just want juice. The medicine I'm taking isn't great with caffeine. That's all. Why do you both look so nervous?""

Zacharias didn't hesitate. ""Go get her some juice.""

His voice was calm, but the warning behind it was clear. He didn't even need to raise his tone. The look in his eyes said enough.

Coral's face turned pale. She bit down on her lip and spoke quickly. ""I'm sorry, Madam. I'll bring you juice right away.""

She grabbed the coffee and rushed out, heels tapping across the marble floor as she disappeared through the door.

Anneliese watched her go, her eyes steady and unreadable. She didn't look away until Zacharias stepped into her line of sight and blocked it with his broad frame.

She gave a small smile. ""She can't even handle a simple drink order. Since when did you become so patient with interns?""

Zacharias' face relaxed.

A moment ago, he thought something was off. Now, hearing her talk like this, he decided she was just being petty. Just jealousy, nothing more.

He leaned over, one hand pressed against the couch's backrest. His voice turned playful.

""Getting jealous? She's a sponsored poor girl. She's still young and doesn't know any better. Why are you even bothered?""

Young? Anneliese thought.

Zacharias must have forgotten—Anneliese was only twenty-two herself. At eighteen, she was already standing beside him, helping him build everything from the ground up.

Back then, Clauderias Tech was nothing more than a tiny team of fewer than ten people.

She started as his assistant, worked long hours, solved endless problems, and by the time she resigned, she was heading the PR department on her own.

She remembered one time when a client humiliated her during a pitch. She had run off to cry alone in a stairwell. Zacharias had found her and told her something without a flicker of sympathy.

""Anneliese, you chose to step into the real world early. That means you better get used to being hit hard. No one's going to coddle your mistakes or moods.""

She used to think he was pushing her to grow. She thought maybe he cared in his own way.

Now she knew the truth. He had always known how to be kind—he just never chose to be kind to her.

...

When Anneliese stepped outside the building, the strength drained from her all at once. Her knees buckled, and she sank onto a bench near the curb.

She dropped her head into her hands, breath caught in her throat.

Her calm began to fall apart. Bit by bit, the hurt and anger took over, sinking into her chest like cold steel. Her heart, already cracked, felt like it was caving in.

The sun slipped lower. Faded light scattered through the gray sky. A chill breeze swept through the street, carrying fine raindrops that clung to her skin.

Dry leaves drifted down and scattered across the road. Cars rolled over them, grinding them into the wet pavement. They looked like everything she had clung to—love, family, pride—all crushed and dirty.

She didn't know how long she sat there, shaking. Her body trembled until it began to still.

She lifted her head and pulled out her phone.

She didn't hesitate as she tapped a number and held the phone to her ear. The call connected after one ring, but no words came out of her mouth.

A calm voice came through the line. ""Anneliese? I'm here.""

That sound hit something deep in her. Familiar, but distant.

Her chest tightened. ""George, I'm sorry to bother you this late. I just wanted to ask... can I still join the Project eVTOL research lab?""

Her voice was barely more than a whisper. Her cheeks flushed with shame. She had no idea if she even deserved to ask.

She had entered Astoria University at fifteen as a gifted aeronautical student.

By junior year, she had already made breakthroughs in sensor-fusion algorithms. Her designs helped drones avoid obstacles with higher accuracy and stability.

She used that research for wildfire detection. The drone she designed became one of the most advanced search-and-rescue models of its time. Even the professors had been blown away.

They filed a patent for her. They offered her a fast track into grad school. The department head took her on as his final disciple. Her future had been bright, solid, and already unfolding.

She even launched Superbflight Aviation with her senior classmates, a startup focused on lightweight aerial cameras.

But four years ago, she gave all of that up for Zacharias. She walked away from school, from the lab, from everything.

Her professor hadn't forgotten her.

Two years ago, he flew to Oceaton himself and personally invited her to join the eVTOL project. She said no again.

Now, she regretted it. All of it.

She bit her lip until she tasted blood, but George's voice remained just as warm. ""Of course. I told you, if you ever wanted to come back, we'd be ready. When can you come? I'll book your flight. Would tomorrow be too soon?""

Anneliese felt a strange warmth bloom in her chest. ""What about Professor...""

""Oh, come on. You know how he is. Just show up. Give him a surprise. Once he sees you, he'll forget whatever grudge he's holding. And if he doesn't, cook him dinner. If that doesn't work, cook him two.""

She laughed through her tears. ""I'll cook every day if I have to. I just need one month to sort out some things here. Is that okay?""

""Of course it is. We'll wait.""

""Thank you. Really.""

She ended the call and sat in silence. The weight pressing down on her chest finally lifted.

One month. She would get a divorce. She would leave this city. She would return to the life that was hers all along.

She looked up, her vision clear.

At that moment, a black Bentley passed by on the road.

The back window was cracked open. Inside, a young girl was straddling a man's lap. Her arms wrapped around him, and their kiss burned through the cold, as if autumn had nothing to do with them at all.

Chapter 3 Don't Even Think About It

If he had just turned his head, even for a second, he would've seen her—his wife, sitting alone at the edge of the sidewalk, drenched in the rain, shaking from the cold, her eyes completely empty.

However, he didn't.

He was too lost in the thrill. That young girl in his arms lit him up with something new. In that moment, he forgot he had a home, a wife, or a past.

Anneliese watched the car fade into the city's neon blur. Then, she stood.

She reached into her purse, pulled out the fertility report, and tore it apart piece by piece. Her fingers moved slow and steady. When she was done, she walked to a nearby trash bin and dropped the shreds in.

Then, she turned and walked the other way.

The night had deepened, and the misty rain still fell.

Even the busy business district had gone quiet.

At the corner, an old lady squatted on the curb. Her white hair clung to her skin under the streetlight, and rain misted across her thin coat. A few bunches of flowers rested by her feet.

Life was hard. Love meant nothing.

Anneliese slipped off her wedding ring. She stepped toward the old lady and gently took her hand. She placed the ring into her palm and folded her fingers over it.

""It's raining. You should go home.""

The old lady said nothing. Anneliese didn't wait for a reply. She turned and walked away.

…

Two minutes later, a black Phantom pulled up to the curb. The driver's door opened, and a man stepped out.

His leather shoes tapped the pavement, polished and narrow, catching the streetlight as he moved. His suit pants lifted slightly as he stepped forward, revealing dark socks and sharp, lean ankles.

He stood tall. His frame filled the sidewalk as he opened a black umbrella and walked straight to the old lady.

He reached down and steadied her as she tried to rise. Her voice wavered. ""Don't be upset, Jonathan. I didn't expect the rain. I'm still healthy. A little water doesn't bother me.""

She explained that she had left a concert. On the way back, her driver had accidentally knocked down a flower seller. He took the girl to the hospital, so she waited here since the company building was nearby. She figured her grandson, the workaholic, could come get her.

However, when she saw the chill in his eyes, her words slowed.

Suddenly, she remembered the ring. She fumbled to push it into his hand.

""A young woman gave this to me by mistake. She walked away before I could say anything. Quick, go after her! She went that way!""

She pointed toward the street.

Jonathan Fullbuster—the old lady's grandson—looked where she indicated and spotted a faint silhouette. A slim figure walked into the lights and fog, her form fading with each step.

""Get in the car.""

He helped his grandmother into the back seat. He turned up the heat, spread out a blanket, and waited until she was settled. Then he shut the door and took off after the girl.

His stride was steady, long, and determined. The figure ahead became clearer.

She walked at a calm pace, straight into the rain. Her mist-blue coat clung to her back, soaked clean through. Her waist looked small, almost fragile. She held herself upright. Her whole presence felt distant, as if nothing in this noisy world could touch her.

She turned the corner and disappeared into the night.

By the time Jonathan caught up, she was gone.

The long street stretched ahead, still and empty. Light reflected in the puddles, casting blurred shapes across the sidewalk. It felt like she had never been there at all.

…

Back in the car, the old lady leaned toward him. ""Well?""

""I didn't catch her.""

She scowled. ""You run an airline and pilot your own planes, and you couldn't catch one girl?""

""Grandma, your logic is a little off.""

""Don't get smart with me. I'm disappointed. That girl was beautiful and kind! Why didn't you show up five minutes earlier? You might've met her! You have no idea how perfect you two would be together!""

""She's married,"" he replied, holding up the ring. It looked like a wedding band.

The old lady didn't take it. She shoved it back toward him. ""So what? She took it off, didn't she? That means something. You'd better go find her and give it back.""

Jonathan turned the ring between his fingers.

The soft pink diamond caught the dim light and glimmered like a secret.

It feels weird… holding a stranger's wedding ring.

His grandmother stared him down.

He gave in and tossed the ring onto the center console and let out a quiet sigh.

A faint smile tugged at the edge of his lips. His sharp profile looked softer in the dark. ""Well, I appreciate your faith in me.""

""I don't care. That ring's worth at least a million. You're going to find that girl and return it. Got it?""

""Got it, Your Majesty.""

He answered without conviction, but his eyes still flicked to the ring. What a headache, he thought.

...

Anneliese didn't check her phone until she was in the back of the cab. Only then did she see the message Zacharias had sent two hours ago.

""Honey, something came up. Not coming home tonight. Sleep early.""

She didn't reply. She swiped away the pinned chat. Then she deleted the contact name ""Hubby"" and changed it to something else.

The bedroom looked like it had been staged for a photo shoot.

Roses covered the floor, their petals trailing from the doorway to the bed in a winding path of red.

Anneliese had dressed the bed in her favorite silk set, a soft shade of yellow that reminded her of buttercups in early spring.

She had gone all in. Every corner felt warm and full of promise.

But now, it felt like a cruel joke.

She stormed in and ripped the sheets off in one hard pull. Petals scattered across the floor, tumbling in every direction like confetti after a failed celebration.

…

The next morning, the doorbell kept ringing. The sound clawed at her skull. Her head throbbed, her temples pounding in sync with every buzz.

She forced herself downstairs and opened the door.

Jessica Sweeting stood there with fury all over her face. Before Anneliese could say a word, Jessica pulled her into a tight hug and started shouting.

""That j*rk! *sshole! He can forget about becoming the richest man now!

""He's got another woman in his heart, treats you like a stand-in, and still manages to fool everyone into thinking he's such a good guy. D*mn. That's some next-level manipulation.

""What storm drain did he crawl out of? Who let him loose to wreck people's lives?

""I swear, I hope he lives long enough to regret everything. May he stay infertile forever, and still have grandkids he doesn't deserve!""

Jessica's mouth didn't stop. Each curse came harder than the last.

Anneliese pulled her inside, guided her to the couch, and poured her a glass of water.

Jessica downed it in one long gulp. When she looked at Anneliese again, she noticed the dark circles under her eyes and the tired slump in her shoulders. She stopped yelling and dug through her bag for a stack of photos.

""Annie…""

""I'm fine. Just show me what you've got.""

Anneliese gave her a weak smile and took the pictures. She had tried to prepare herself. But the moment her eyes landed on the photos, her chest went tight.

Zacharias had Coral tucked away in a private villa just a few streets from his company.

They walked around together like a couple on vacation, bold and casual, with their hands locked like they had nothing to hide.

In one photo, taken just before dusk, Coral had her legs wrapped around his waist as he carried her into the villa. Her body pressed close. Her expression smug.

On her private social account, Coral showed off designer bags—bags identical to the ones Zacharias had given Anneliese.

In her latest post, Coral wore a diamond bracelet. Her fingers rested on a man's chest, her caption written like a claim—'His love is in the diamond. His heart is under my hand.'

Anneliese clenched the photo. Her knuckles went pale, and her eyes burned.

It wasn't about missing him. It wasn't even about heartbreak anymore.

It was about everything she had poured into a man who gave her back nothing but lies.

Jessica snatched the photos from her hand and hissed under her breath.

""Thank God you never slept with him. Or you'd be at the doctor by now. And even if everything came back clean, you'd still be sick just thinking about it.""

Anneliese gave a tired laugh. ""Yeah. Lucky me, right?""

She stood up and headed upstairs. A few minutes later, she returned with two big bags and dropped them at Jessica's feet.

""Help me sell all of it. And use the money to support some girls who actually need it. Someone who deserves a shot.""

The bags were full of expensive gifts—watches, perfumes, purses, and jewelry. Things Zacharias had given her over the years.

But packing them made her realize something. None of it had ever meant anything. It was just money. Thoughtless, effortless spending.

She used to treasure those things. Now she couldn't stand to look at them.

Why keep them, just to risk running into Coral wearing the same purse?

Jessica and Anneliese had grown up together in the same group home.

Jessica now ran a small hustle with two friends—part-time detectives, fake girlfriends, side-job specialists.

They did everything from catching cheaters to reselling luxury bags.

Anything for a price.

Jessica pulled the bags closer and gave a sharp whistle.

""Don't worry. I'll flip this stuff and find a few broke, hot high school guys to mentor. Let Zacharias know women can do the same d*mn thing.""

Sponsoring wasn't just a man's game.

Anneliese smiled and shook her head.

""No need. Let the stuff go to someone who needs it. Not every girl down on her luck turns into Coral. And Zacharias? He's garbage. But I'm not crawling in after him.""",1,1758451936.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

Ultimately, I’m wanting to get all of this off my chest so scroll away if this type of post gets to you as I’ve searched on here and it’s common. I’m genuinely down tonight so am just wanting to vent. Sorry if this annoys you. 

However, as I near my mid 20s I think it’s finally hit me that I’ll never have the friends I missed out on having when I was younger or in high school. At school I was quite shy which meant other guys liked me but never wanted to hang out our develop friendships as I was more quiet and didn’t put myself out there. This has meant I’ve gone through life with lots of acquaintances but never any friendships. And I fear it’s too late! 

I met another guy once my age with a lot of similar interests but he never wanted to go beyond small talk. He’d always talk to me about his friend group but it was clear he was content with the amount of friends in his life as when I suggested we catch up he ghosted me. This is the continuous problem I see - pre-existing friend groups from high school that aren’t open to inserting someone new into the group.

I feel guilty even for posting here, and I see people with really serious need for help and here I am requesting help to get through a week. 

The context is, normally I am able to get through the month, but due to my wife losing her job last month, and me not expecting it, I failed to properly budget for the month. 

I feel ashamed and like a failure.

My mental health hasn't been good for a while and my depression is kicking like a mule, and I adding everything on top of living in constant pain and chronic fatigue makes me feel ever worse. 

I am sorry for being here asking for help, when there are people way worse than me, and I want to apologize to them.

So, to the matter I need help is that I ran out of money and can't afford groceries including food for my dog and cat. I worry most about them because they have no fault. They have been the best friends that keep me busy and they are a light in my day. 

I just need help to get through this week, and I'll do my best to survive next month by ourselves.

My wife is also working hard on getting a job (short term) and starting her own business (long term) but these things take time. 

If you can spare a couple of bucks, please do use the link on my profile to ""Buy me a coffee"".

Anything will be appreciated, and I will pay it forward during the coming months, to anyone else in need.

I'm sorry for being here when my troubles seem so small, but I don't have anyone in my life witch capacity to help us, in current times. 

My target would be 200 Euro, although I know it would require a Crowdfunding platform, which I have not get yet. I might get one later for my wife business...

I tested a bunch of services—across US, UK, CA, and FR content—and finally settled on my personal top five. Here’s how they each stacked up, from my own living room.

* * *

### 1\. [XXIPTV](https://www.reddit.com/r/LLptv/wiki/index/)

*   **Price:** $15/month (or less if you go for a longer [**iptv subscription 2025**](https://xxiptv.top/))
    
*   **Channels:** 38,000+ live, 130,000+ VOD (US, UK, CA, FR all well covered)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 9/10 (hardly any buffering, even on big US/UK game nights)
    
*   **My experience:** XXIPTV was suggested by a UK-based [**iptv reseller**](https://xxiptv.top/). I honestly didn’t expect much, but it wound up being my go-to. The lineup is massive and the US/UK/CA/FR streams just work—even when half the country is watching the same thing. Their [**best iptv trial**](https://iptvmeezzy.life/) made testing safe and easy. Setup was fast, and I never had to chase down support.
    

* * *

### 2\. [IPTVMEZZY](https://www.reddit.com/r/iptv_provider_2025/wiki/index/)

*   **Price:** $16/month (discounts on longer plans)
    
*   **Channels:** 45,000+ live, 220,000+ VOD (huge variety, strong for US, UK, CA, FR)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 8.5/10 (solid most of the time, but busy UK sports nights can be a test)
    
*   **My experience:** IPTVMEZZY ended up in my rotation thanks to a Canadian friend obsessed with hockey. The selection is huge, and I could hop from US news to French movies to UK sitcoms with barely a pause. Most nights are smooth, but during major live events, I sometimes needed a refresh.
    

* * *

### 3\. [Aurorastreaming](https://www.reddit.com/r/alibabaiptv/wiki/index/)

*   **Price:** $14/month
    
*   **Channels:** 32,000+ live, 105,000+ VOD (especially deep in UK/FR, but also plenty of US/CA)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 8/10 (great for movies and catch-up TV, occasional lag with UK live sports)
    
*   **My experience:** Aurorastreaming was a surprise hit for their old-school French and UK content. I caught up on British comedies I hadn’t seen in years. Streams were dependable, though a few live UK football matches stuttered at peak time.
    

* * *

### 4\. [RapidWave TV](https://www.reddit.com/r/alibabaiptv/wiki/index/)

*   **Price:** $13/month
    
*   **Channels:** 21,000+ live, 60,000+ VOD (mostly US/UK/CA, lighter on FR)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 7.5/10 (good for everyday stuff, but live sports can buffer at busy times)
    
*   **My experience:** RapidWave TV is my “leave it on in the background” pick. Great for US morning news, UK talk shows, and Canadian documentaries. French selection could be better, but what’s there works fine. Setup for their [**iptv subscription 2025**](https://aurorastreaming.online/) was quick and painless.
    

* * *

### 5\. PolarStream IPTV

*   **Price:** $12/month
    
*   **Channels:** 15,000+ live, 44,000+ VOD (US/UK basics, some CA/FR)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 7/10 (evenings mean more buffering, especially on live UK/US sports)
    
*   **My experience:** PolarStream IPTV is my backup for when I just want something on—like old US sitcoms or late-night UK news. Not the best for big live events. If you’re thinking about being an **iptv reseller**, their portal is slick, but I mostly just watched. Not my main choice, but handy in a pinch.
    

* * *

What I Learned After a Year of IPTV
-----------------------------------

*   **Always try the best iptv trial** first—your setup and what you watch really matter.
    
*   Channel numbers look impressive, but most of us only use a fraction. I’d rather have fewer, more stable channels than a million random ones.
    
*   Even [**top rated iptv**](https://iptvmeezzy.life/) services have off-nights, especially when the US or UK is glued to a big live event.
    
*   Thinking of becoming an [**iptv reseller**](https://xxiptv.top/)? Prepare for a lot of “my stream stopped” messages from friends and family.
    
*   And yes, use a VPN. It keeps things private and sometimes even helps with speed.",0,1758451359.0,wayland,0,0.5,False

I've had to admit to myself that I have a ridiculous amount of jewellery for one retired lady 😂! 

I've always collected jewellery - when I was working it was my one extravagance, especially if I got a bonus. I have gold and silver and costume jewellery, and family jewellery that I've inherited, some of which is Victorian. I developed an ebay habit in lockdown which grew my collection. And now I have so much that I can't display it all or have all of it easily to hand. Every day I tend to put on my easy to wear ""go to"" jewellery that I took off the night before, because I live a much simpler lifestyle now that I'm not working.

I'm currently thinking that I should wear something different from my jewellery collection each day, even if I'm just pottering around my home, and whenever I'm going out, even if just to meet friends, I should wear something just a bit fabulous and possibly OTT for a coffee meet-up.

Find the slightly disappointing review for the espresso maker here:

[Its not Outin nano: Caramelly Fikapresso Pro Portable Espresso Maker ](https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1nd9vvp/its_not_outin_nano_caramelly_fikapresso_pro/)

Even though it was not outin, I thought of taking a risk and getting the ""OutIn Nano Portable Espresso Machine Basket Plus"" as I do not do single shots.

**The product:**

https://preview.redd.it/6rnjepfrthqf1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3e9f839692dd321cd9bf7a342c2f912cd3a2e793

My first impressions is that the build quality on this is extremely good. ***Caramelly does not have a 18gms basket***.

And I am really happy that it fit with the non OutIn nano (Caramelly Fikapresso Pro).

https://preview.redd.it/hdo1eljwthqf1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dfeb79fa06eafa58716c21431dc2cb53d7de923d

**I decided to brew a double shot:**

[Freshly ground coffee around 18gms](https://preview.redd.it/6cwybkaythqf1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b8f938b9d524508045a662b2bc352ba90826727b)

[Nice concentric circle pattern](https://preview.redd.it/szwbm06duhqf1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2d39fcf12845248b421dd0c2c1a14f189a52ef4d)

**The brew:**

[The brew was completely fine!!](https://reddit.com/link/1nmofr5/video/eeb38knfuhqf1/player)

[Very decent crema.](https://preview.redd.it/64ant6nhuhqf1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=de4f1729ab9906f505040a398de257807d195200)

The basket is defintely better than the default 8gms basket that comes with the caramellyh fikapresso. I am glad I took the risk and it fit :).

I am also guessing that the OutIn Nano has better build quality than the caramelly fikapresso based on how this basket is built. 

Thanks,

Hello everyone,
Does anyone has already this espresso machine? I would like to have some opinion on this. I know it doesn’t have any gouge.

I already own a flair  58 (with no preheating chamber) I use stock roast coffee beans for my espresso because I come from South Italy and that’s how we drink it
So like 85°/ 88° C  for me is OK.

I found on a craigslist the Quissaco Arco for 480€
I’m thinking of soldiering my Flair 58.
First because I like to change once in a while equipment, and then I like the design a lot very minimalistic ",1,1758450273.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

33 y/o guy with a cute smile (have been told so) with a career in tech ( but not a tech bro ), a calm presence with a life that has been a wild adventure of extremes, I thrive on intellectual chaos. I like to read, anything everything from systems theory to modern french history, particularly energy and clean (it’s one of my passion). After taking a break from dating, I am giving it a one more shot

**What I’m Looking For:**

A **childfree, progressive partner** who sees life as a playground of possibilities, not a checklist. Someone unapologetically herself—sexually liberated, intellectually fearless, and allergic to societal scripts. Let’s skip the small talk and dissect the big questions: How do we live ethically in a burning world? Can love exist without ownership?

**Why We Might Click:**

* **Staunchly Childfree :** I don’t want kids (ever), both for personal freedom and because bringing new life into an overburdened world feels tragically naive. Let’s channel that energy into activism, art, or adventure instead.
* **You crave depth :** My attachment style is securely rooted. I’m here for mutual growth, not games. Whether we’re debating moral gray zones or testing new boundaries in the bedroom, I value curiosity over judgment.
* **You’re a shapeshifter :** Artist, scientist, activist, hedonist.... you refuse to be boxed in. Bonus if you’ve got stories from living unconventionally or a passion project that keeps you up at night.
* **You laugh easily :** My humor leans dry, my vibe is warm, and I’ll absolutely lean into the absurdity of dating via Reddit posts

\*\*The Vibe:\*\*Imagine slow mornings with coffee and *Sapiens* debates, weekends volunteering at climate marches or getting lost in a neon-lit bar abroad. I’m driven but not ruthless, my version of “Machiavellian” is designing a life that’s sustainable, joyful, and defiantly *ours*. Let’s be catalysts, not conformists.( I don't have any societal morality )

**TL;DR:** Childfree, progressive, and insatiably curious?",0,1758450227.0,cf4cf,0,0.5,False

As a pure espresso maker it’s been brilliant. Unfortunately I broke the filter holder so bought a replacement part online which is specifically for that machine. Supposedly. 

However when I use the machine now the water bypasses via the side of the filter holder, irrespective of how hard I rotate the holder in the locking mechanism. The coffee holder bit is the same. 

Looking underneath there’s a rubberised o ring around the outlet which looks pristine. I can only assume that either the filter holder isn’t deep enough to properly tighten or the locking mechanism itself is knackered. 

Does anybody have any suggestions please? Rather not buy a new machine if don’t need to but appreciate I’ve had very good use out of it.  ",1,1758450144.0,DeLonghi,0,1.0,False
