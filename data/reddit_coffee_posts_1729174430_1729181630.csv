1g5uju7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1g5uju7/i_dont_understand_what_i_did_wrong/,I don’t understand what I did wrong,"I (24f) met someone on bumble (29m) and we had an almost instant connection, spoke all night on text and met the next day for coffee. For context, he’s a foreigner (British) in my country working with the government on contract for a few years. I’ve never really dated anyone other than my own ethnicity so I wasn’t sure what our cultural dating differences would be like so I was kind of cautious and thought it’s best to discuss expectations before getting into anything. 

He asked me what I was looking for and I said I didn’t have any expectations from bumble and just want to meet some cool likeminded people but keeping an open mind if something works out and said he was looking for something meaningful. 

We hit it off really well on the first date and he asked to meet again and we met consecutively for the next three days, we kissed on the third date. A week into it he told me he’d like to exclusively talk to me now and no one else, I agreed and said I would like that but I would also like to take things slow and not looking to get into a serious relationship at the moment. 

A few days later we ended up at the same house party and he completely ignored me. We briefly said hi to each other but the entire time he was chatting to this one girl while I’m quite an introvert and was mingling with pretty much everyone. I felt bad about it and asked him why he did that to which he said he wasn’t intentionally ignoring me and he didn’t want to butt into the conversation since I was either talking to people in my native language or having a one on one conversation with someone the entire time. The next day we met again at his place and he was very warm and affectionate. This was a week ago

Yesterday he sent me a long message saying he has really enjoyed the past few weeks but he’s been feeling this weird pressure and isn’t sure of what he wants because of his reaction to other girls in the past week or so, he wants to continue seeing me and spending time with me because he really likes me but wants to take a step back. Backstory: he was talking to this one girl before he met me and it got sexual, when he told her he didn’t want to be in touch anymore because he met someone (me) she went off on him and called him names. This girl popped up again yesterday and he said he had a sex dream about her which confused him and he felt this sense of guilt towards me. 

When he said all of this to me initially I felt kind of sad but then I realised it’s just my ego that’s hurt, I don’t get rejected ever, I like to think I’m a 8 or 9 even, I felt sad but I played it cool with him, I told him I was glad he said that because I felt like we were moving too fast considering we literally just met. We both agreed to cool things down and just hang out and see where things go and if later on we feel like we’re ready to be exclusive we can come to that decision naturally. 

He’s currently out of town for two weeks because his friends are visiting from his hometown. I think I’ve been feeling a little upset since last night and I don’t know what to do. Should I continue to stay in touch with him once he’s back or just move on? I really like him and I’m not someone who likes to play games when I’m interested in someone. The conversation is always so witty and so interesting and I feel like I don’t have to pretend to be someone I’m not in front of him. Help!! I need your advice! Also, was this him rejecting me or am I reading it wrong? ",1,1729181452.0,dating,1,0.99,False

1g5ujlt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/1g5ujlt/falling_asleep_and_coffee/,Falling asleep and coffee,"I have been meditating for about a year now, and despite being committed, I always doze off and have hypnogogic dreamlike thoughts which pull me out of focus. The ONLY thing which helps me get through is a cup of strong coffee before sitting. I only drink 1 cup a day -- no energy drinks, no other stimulants. 

It's not that I simply lose focus without it... I have the nonsensical visions that you get as you fall asleep, to where it's completely out of my control whether I can focus on the object of meditation. 

I have had a sleep study done and thoroughly changed my diet in the past year to see if there was an issue there, but the sleep study came back negative (actually went to a sleep center and they hooked me up to cords and I slept there), and I still can't reach past the 10 minute mark without falling asleep. It is extremely frustrating.

I have never been a user of large amounts of caffeine. I have quit coffee for some extended periods to see if it quitting would help meditation. While I can carry on my normal daily activities without any caffeine, I cannot meditate without it because I'll fall asleep. 

I just completed a session after a cup of coffee, and I was able to get past 20 minutes. Having to rely on a stimulant to get through it makes me feel like something's wrong with me.

1g5uhev,https://www.reddit.com/r/orangecounty/comments/1g5uhev/follow_up_are_you_putting_down_roots_in_orange/,[Follow Up] Are You Putting Down Roots in Orange County?,"A few weeks ago \[[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/orangecounty/comments/1ft0g7r/are_you_putting_down_roots_in_orange_county/)\], I asked the people of this subreddit how strongly rooted they feel in Orange County. Beyond home ownership, I wanted to understand what really makes people feel anchored here—or, conversely, what makes them feel unsettled or transient.

After analyzing **94** top-level comments, I found that there’s much more to feeling rooted in OC than simply owning a home. The responses touched on everything from family and community ties to the cost of living and lifestyle preferences.

To give you a visual snapshot of the key themes that emerged, I’ve created a word cloud highlighting the most commonly mentioned reasons people feel rooted—or not—in Orange County:

https://preview.redd.it/7ycdk8e75cvd1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=442480e3366168e950de820a9474b831a1e10fb1

# Key Findings:

**1. Homeownership and Rootedness Are Linked—But It’s Not the Only Factor**

Unsurprisingly, owning a home was strongly associated with feeling rooted in OC. About **82%** of those who said they feel rooted also owned their homes. For example, u/13inchmushroommaker shared their experience of feeling more connected to the community:

>""Moved from Los Angeles to Orange County in 2008. I own my home, and even though I don't align politically with my neighbors, the community is incredibly welcoming, and the neighbors are involved. The holidays where I live are amazing as everyone gets involved. I intend to leave my properties to my kids so they can continue to live in OC without issues.""

However, it’s important to note that **18%** of respondents who felt rooted didn’t own a home. This shows that while homeownership plays a role in stability, it’s not the only way people build connections here. For many, family or social ties were much more influential.

**2. Family Ties Are the Strongest Factor in Rootedness**

Family connections were frequently mentioned. Around 37% of respondents said that being close to family—whether it’s parents, children, or extended relatives—was the most important factor in staying in OC. For example, u/sdabear shared:

>""I was born here in the '90s to immigrant parents who came here in their teens. I own my home, but wow, the mortgage is no joke. Now that I have my own children, I feel way, way rooted. Although it's super costly, having my village around makes it worth it 10000x over. I’ve considered moving to feel independent, but after having kids, I realized I’d much rather stay close to my village.""

Whether respondents owned a home or rented, the desire to raise children near extended family or stay close to aging parents was a recurring theme.

**3. Social Ties Can Make or Break Feeling Rooted**

Friendships and connections to the broader community played a major role in whether people felt rooted. About **23%** of respondents said their social life—friendships and community ties—helped them feel more connected. But for some, struggling to make close friends left them feeling less grounded, even if they owned a home. For example, u/omnificunderachiever shared:

>""I've lived at least four years in seven different places, but after moving to Irvine four years ago and buying a home a couple of years ago, I'd like this to be my forever home. That said, although I've made numerous acquaintances since moving, I don't feel like I've made any close friends here yet. That's the only thing that prevents me from feeling like I'm truly home.""

This demonstrates that social relationships, or the lack thereof, can play a big part in whether people feel like they truly belong, even when other factors like family or homeownership are solidly in place.

**4. Cost of Living Makes People Feel Less Secure**

The high cost of living in Orange County was one of the most frequently mentioned reasons people felt unsettled. About **17%** of respondents, whether homeowners or renters, expressed concern that they might have to leave eventually due to high living expenses. u/LongjumpingHotel2848 expressed this sentiment:

>""I've been here almost 6 years now. I will be moving to live closer to my parents because I cannot realistically afford to live here. I rent and can barely get by. The cost of living made me realize my dream of owning a home and starting a family is not realistic here.""

Even those who owned homes were concerned about whether their children or future generations would be able to afford to stay in OC, raising long-term questions about family rootedness.

**5. Lifestyle and Weather Play a Key Role**

Many of you noted that the OC lifestyle—its beaches, sunny weather, and outdoor activities—makes it hard to imagine living elsewhere. About **16%** of respondents pointed to these environmental factors as reasons why they feel anchored to the area. For example, u/AsheratOfTheSea explained:

>""Born and raised, left for college and my first two jobs, then came back in my 30s, bought a house, and haven't left since. OC has so many things to do, tons of good restaurants, excellent healthcare, and great weather and beaches. It's expensive as hell, but if you can afford it, it's paradise. I'm never moving.""

These factors were particularly significant for those who had moved away and later returned, citing the quality of life as a primary reason for coming back.

# Weaving It All Together: Rootedness in OC

From these responses, it’s clear that feeling rooted in Orange County is a mix of personal circumstances, including homeownership, family ties, social connections, cost of living, and lifestyle preferences.

The cost of living is a pervasive issue that complicates people's sense of security. Both homeowners and renters frequently cited the high expenses of living in OC as a reason for feeling uncertain about their long-term future here. This concern resonates even with those who love the area for its weather, beaches, and proximity to outdoor activities.

At the same time, family connections are powerful motivators for staying rooted. Whether it’s caring for aging parents or raising children near extended family, the emotional bonds people share with their families are central to their decisions to stay in OC. Time spent in one place—and the memories and associations that come with it—also deepen people’s sense of attachment.

Friendships and neighbors add another layer of complexity. While some respondents found that social connections made them feel at home, others struggled to make lasting friendships, leaving them feeling transient despite loving the area.

Lastly, there’s a contrast between those who grew up in OC and those who moved here later in life. Many lifelong residents have deep ties to the area, while newcomers seem more divided—some have embraced OC as their permanent home, while others are still navigating how to establish a deeper sense of belonging.

# Striving for a Mindset of Rootedness

One interesting takeaway from this discussion is the value of striving for a mindset of rootedness. Even if financial challenges or social struggles make it difficult to fully commit to a place, investing in your community—whether by building relationships, engaging with neighbors, or exploring local activities—can create a sense of belonging that goes beyond external factors.

Rooting yourself in a place, even when it feels uncertain, can enrich your life and contribute to a stronger, more supportive community. It's about more than just owning a home or having family nearby; it’s about the mindset you bring to where you live and the connections you choose to foster.

# Final Thoughts: Let’s Keep the Conversation Going

I want to extend a huge thank you to everyone who shared their stories and insights in the original post. Your responses were thoughtful and insightful, and they’ve helped create a more nuanced understanding of what it means to feel rooted in OC.

I’d love to hear more from you. What keeps you rooted in OC, or what makes it hard for you to feel settled?

1g5uekj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Autism_Parenting/comments/1g5uekj/a_very_quick_thank_you/,A very quick 'Thank You',"A few days ago I was reading a thread here and someone mentioned that for their own child, they had created a 'safe space' a little area where their child, who was comforted by squishmallows could sit and drink their chocolate milk and be there with lesser supervision allowing the parent to do some chores.

  


Our son is very similar with the squishmallow love and yesterday, we had fashioned his ball pit into a ""comfort pit"" with his squishmallow collection, a few blankets and easy access to his water.

  


What a difference it has made for him already, our little dude who would \*not\* sit still is taking 10-15-20 minute sections of time in his comfort pit, to relax and watch his favourite movies and shows and it's allowing us a little break to do some more chores or simply not feeling over-touched and stimulated ourselves.

(Or linked to a past of substance abuse) TW:drugs,"So I’m currently on Effexor 225mg to treat my depression and anxiety. I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was a child and always suffered with focus, fatigue, issues with socializing, depression and anxiety. I’ve tried many different medications…Prozac, Wellbutrin, lexapro, vyvanse, adderall. When I was diagnosed as a child I was prescribed ritalin which, according to my parents, made me lose an unhealthy amount of weight and made me robotic, so they stopped me from taking it. 
 Unfortunately I smoked a lot of weed as an adolescent, starting as early as 14 years old. I became very dependent on it. I was also taking Prozac along with it…unknowingly probably causing a lot more damage to my developing brain. I smoked weed on and off throughout school, along with taking antidepressants. When I graduated high school I decided to quit smoking. My memories since then have been very foggy. 
 I’d change antidepressants throughout the years because one would just not work for me anymore, or I’d just feel depressed and not have any motivation to do anything. I got into a toxic relationship that involved  us smoking a lot of weed together. When that relationship finally ended I stopped smoking. Then I got into another relationship and started smoking AGAIN. Then that ended and I stopped smoking. Ive been off of weed since 2022 and I’ve been in a relationship since then as well. I crave it sometimes, but try my hardest to ignore it. 
 I started taking Effexor around early 2023 I think, working my way up, I noticed a big difference with my anxiety. I feel way more calm, but along with that I would feel incredibly fatigue. I’d still be forgetful and have issues with short term memory.  Every appointment with my psych I’d tell them I’m so tired but otherwise good mentally, so they’d increase it. Now my energy levels seem to be normal I guess, I still find it difficult to get up in the morning sometimes and have to drink coffee to stay moving. However lately I’ve noticed my forgetfulness has been pretty bad. I lost my debit card, forgot to do important tasks at work, and I’ll forget conversations that I’ve had only a few minutes ago. Part of me is wondering if this memory issue has been worsened because of the increase of Effexor? Has anyone else dealt with this? Sorry for the long story but I thought it would be important to mention my past history, since I’ve read that abusing marijuana at a young age can cause memory problems as an adult.

So the think i want to talk about is the fact that i have seen a lot of people using the conflict as an excuse to be just awful people and to say to the other some of the most psychotic shit i have seen and to the point it doesn't even make sense like they have to understand they don't make a difference on way or another with just being assholes online they don't help the kids in Gaza that are dying like i am pro palestine but how being awful and wishing for the kid from Stranger Things to die (is he like 19 or something) helps the people in Gaza don't get me wrong he did say some stupid things but i have seen the most crazy stuff directed against him like he's the head of IDF and maybe if they wishi from him to die hard enough tomorow would be peace in the middle east.

It goes even farther attack on people like Ethan who have very reasonable takes on the conflict like can someone explain to me one of all of you who attack Ethan how does it help the cause they are people that are actually BAD that are actually pro Palestinian genocide and you guys attack person who just felt bad for the people that died in Octomber 7th like i don't get it is because Ethan actually feels bad ?

I've been in the workforce for a while now, earning around $70k annually, and my current go-to card is the Citi Cash Back Plus Card. While it's been okay for general use, I'm beginning to realise that I might be missing out on better benefits or rewards by not having a more tailored strategy. I have also just shifted to using the UOB one account but have yet to get a card from UOB to get the increased interest so it would be good if the strategy involves a uob card to clock the minimum $500 spending.

Here’s a bit more detail about my situation:

* **Income**: $70,000 annually
* **Current Card**: Citi Cash Back Plus Card
* **Typical Monthly Spending**: $1,000 - $2,000, but can vary with shopping or unexpected expenses.
* **Categories**: I feel that the bulk of my spending comes from shopping from Taobao, Mrt/Buses, Helpling, Online subscriptions, as well as common bills like phone bill (Zero1), broadband bill (M1). Other than that it'll just be my day to day meals, coffee shops, mac donald's, etc.

**Goals:**

1. **Maximize Rewards/Cash Back**: I want to get the most out of my spending, whether through cash back, points, or other rewards.
2. **Consider Travel Perks**: While not a frequent traveler, I would love to hear about cards that offer good travel benefits for future trips. Been trying to get into the miles game for awhile now.

**Questions:**

* What type of card(s) should I consider based on my spending habits and income?
* Any advice on managing multiple cards effectively if that's the way to go?
* How do you balance between cash back and travel rewards if you don't travel often?

1g5u30q,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1g5u30q/i_owe_my_stalker_my_life/,I owe my stalker my life,"For weeks, it had become increasingly apparent that I was being followed. At first, it started with an eerie feeling that someone was watching me. I’d be ordering in a coffee shop when I’d feel eyes on me, only to turn around to nothing.

Soon enough, I started noticing a man appear in the same places as me. He was always just barely visible, but even from a distance I could recognize it was him. 

I tried to convince myself it was mere coincidence, until one day I entered the bus to find him sitting in my usual seat. 

“Sorry, I don’t mean to startle you. My name is Jackson. I’ve seen you during a couple of my outings and can’t help but to admire your beauty.”

I said nothing and looked forward.

“Please don’t be alarmed Christine, I just want to get to know you.”

“How do you know my name?”

His smile dropped. He slipped up. 

“I must have heard it during one of our run-ins. I am not certain. But anyway, here is my number.” He shoved a piece of paper into my jacket pocket. “How about that date?”

I told him to fuck off and quickly exited the bus. I had hoped that would be the last of him, but I could never shake the feeling that he was watching. 

One night I was walking home from the bar, and in my drunken state I slipped into the light rail tracks and hit my head. I was out cold.

As I woke, I could feel my body being pulled from the tracks, just in time before the tram sped by. 

It was him.

He panicked when he saw that I recognized him, and fled. 

I couldn’t stop thinking about him for the next few days. He rescued me, he was my knight in shining armor. My savior. I wanted him. But even when I would go to my usual spots, he was nowhere in sight. 

Then I remembered. I dug the piece of paper out from my jacket pocket and dialed the number.

“Hello? Who is this?”

“Um, hi, this is Christine. Well, I wanted to thank you for the other night. I guess I also just wanted to see if you still wanted to go on that date.”

“Oh, well, actually, I think it’s best that we skip that.” He hung up. 

I was devastated. Why didn’t he want me anymore? The moment I showed interest, the game was over for him.

But it was my turn to play the game now. It was surprisingly easy.

Too easy to spike his drink at the bar. Too easy to shove him in my car. Too easy to tie him up inside my apartment. 

As he started waking up, my heart melted a little. There he was, my prince. 

“Jackson, it’s me. Please don’t be alarmed. I just want to get to know you.”

I would argue that if anything, it's harder to make a good dark roast because of how little room there is between a proper dark roast and a burnt roast.

I'm trying to explain to her, but she's not listening to me. I'm sorry, is there something wrong with her..? She didn't act like this when we first met. She was very nice and friendly, even helped me with my phone when it was being buggy. Now, there's something... off about her, I just don't know what. ... Wait, I remember seeing a poster somewhere in the game, I think it was a meme? It said that the owner of the game has the ability to shape-shift into... anyone... he wants.. oh my god, don't tell me he-*

There is a girl in one of my classes that I am interested in. I have introduced myself before and talked briefly a few times but nothing crazy. One day randomly she emails me asking for help on one of the assignments. We then exchange phone numbers over email. I asked her if she wanted to meet up somewhere but she said she was busy with work and wondered if I could just send my work to her. I would like to ask her if she wants to do the homework next week at a coffee shop or something. If that goes well maybe grab lunch after.

I'm having a hard time telling if she is interested or just using me for answers. The homework she asked for help with wasn't a graded assignment. So it's not like she is just using me for her grades. Also, her randomly reaching out over email could be a good sign.

1g5tqt5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g5tqt5,Thompson Houston,"Stayed at the Thompson Houston on points & was upgraded from a 1 King bed to a Corner King Suite which overlooked the pool. (It was my birthday).


Entrance to the hotel was a tiny bit confusing to locate, even as a ""local"", but not a huge deal. Staff/valet welcomed me & escorted me to the elevator.

Check-in was on the 7th floor & completed quickly. Everyone was super friendly except one guy who was pretty snooty. I arrived around 1pm & the room wasn't ready yet, so I waited out by the pool. 

The room was spacious & I love the classic Thompson aesthetic. There's a nice sized closet, espresso maker & mini bar, as well as a desk. Bathroom is awesome due to the large soaking tub with views, and the rainfall shower. 

Gym & spa are on the 6th level & were nice & quiet during my visit. Free reusable water bottles there too. 

There is a destination fee & they are quiet about what that gives you. You get access to the huge gym across the parking lot which is 24hrs (just show room key). You also get access to the house car, a BMW iX. It can drop you off in a 3mi radius, subject to availability. YMMV for a pick up if you talk to the driver. 

Breakfast is in the restaurant Sol 7, which also serves lunch, dinner, and is the bar. It's located right across from the check-in desk. They're pretty gracious with the limit for globalist, ~$100 I hear. My bill was far less & was completely wiped clean, no fuss over ""specialty"" coffee either. Valet also proactively wiped off folio & i left with a $0 balance. 

My biggest gripe, if I had to make one is the pool situation. You have to enter the pool by going through the restaurant. Maybe it's nitpicking, but i find that annoying as a guest & as someone who could be there for dinner/drinks. Once you get outside there are 8 loungers available, with possibly 5 smaller ""cabanas"" for free. The rest of the seating you have to rent.  I think they could add a few more seating options on the outskirts of the pool/bar area. Lastly, I was told they will start selling day passes to the pool, which will only make the smaller area more crowded and virtually no seating. 

Overall I did enjoy this property & would certainly stay again on points, as the cash prices are very high.

Out of the blue, I saw on her ig story a post about a certain song that I enjoyed and caught up. We grabbed coffee to catch up, and we are very compatible: common intreast, life goals, insecurites, our past, etc. We're very open to each other. Time line this was about 2-3 months ago and we didn't hang out much since, coffee twice, walked out dog, and I mostly chatted by sending memes and stuff.

Here the kicker, she has been in a relationship for a while 4 years. And recently, she broke up with her boyfriend, they were considering marriage and all. I know they had issues but I tried not to pry. 

A couple weeks after they broke up, she asked me on a date and we have been seeing each other for about 3 months now and are even planning to meet each other family during the holidays,

Now all her friends kinda hate me and blame me for ruining her relationship with her significant other. Granted, I do feel guilty. But I really can't imagine my life without this woman.

So, let’s break down the S&P 500 chart over the past year. What you're seeing here is basically a steady climb with some bumps along the way. Classic market behavior, right? I mean, the S&P 500 started the year almost crawling out of a bear hangover from 2023, then quickly found its legs and started running. The thing is, this chart screams ""bullish recovery"" to me—look at how it keeps pushing those highs. But hey, let’s not get too optimistic just yet.

Early on, around January and February, it’s like the market woke up, took a sip of coffee, and said, “Alright, let’s do this.” The upward trend was relatively smooth, and things looked promising. But, come June and July, we saw a bit of hesitation. Fast forward to August-September, and you’ve got a bit of a hiccup. It’s typical around this time, honestly. People start pulling profits, big institutions do their thing, and volatility creeps in. That dip? I wouldn't sweat it too much. It's like the market's way of testing who's still got nerves of steel.

And October recovery. By the end of this chart, we’re looking at new peaks, pushing over 5,850. It feels like there’s this relentless drive upward, and if I had to guess, it's fueled by optimism in Q4 earnings or maybe anticipation of some dovish Fed moves. You know how it goes—any hint of rate cuts, and everyone’s all in.

Still, I’d be cautious. Just because the chart shows resilience doesn’t mean we’re invincible. I wouldn’t be surprised if we see another shakeout before the end of the year, but for now, it looks like the bulls are enjoying the ride.",1,1729179076.0,WhiteRhinoM,0,1.0,False

1g5tk5y,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1g5tk5y/keep_losing_jobs_23m/,"Keep losing jobs, 23m","

Right before I graduated with my associates degree, I lost my minimum wage part time job right before the beginning of this past summer. I was cited for performance infractions. But I know the real reason was because I stopped talking interpersonally to management and just decided to focus on my job and leave everything at work, at work. 

I then started working at a movie theater. 1 month in, my immediate supervisor told me that I would not be paid for about 3-4 hours of training that I had completed.. which is against the Fair Labor Standards Act. I told them that and the general manager proceeded to argue with me. I told her I didn't want to report a wage claim if I didn't get paid, but I would if I needed to. Long story short, I was suspended, paid the money they owed me, and terminated.

I started working for a liquor store and my coworker stole a cash tip that was clearly personally given to me. I reported him and management said they knew his grandmother and that he wouldn't be punished.. so he's basically allowed to steal. I quit same day.

Started working for a coffee shop. Lower level immediate supervisor was **extremely** rude to me and my fellow baristas. Unprofessional, snarky, and nasty. She's the type that everyone would say is extremely nice and pleasant and bubbly when you first meet them. Then you see what they really are. And then she goes back to acting pleasant. A hot and cold personality as well as a person that likely believes that that makes up for their rudeness. After about a month of trying my best to stay out of her way so she would leave me alone, she, for the millionth accumulated time, said something extremely snarky with a horrible tone to me over the walkee. I couldn't help at this point but to respond with the same level of malevolence and then she started yelling at me on the floor. I told her I was going to report her for unprofessionalism and that set her off even further and went as far as to tell me that that was a ""threat"". I got sent home and I am currently here about an hour after the fact typing this now.

All of this happened during the span of the beginning of this past summer to now, 10/17. I guess i'm asking for advice on how to deal with people in the workplace.. as I am clearly not dealing with them correctly. And any other piece of advice anyone would like to give me in general. Thanks

1g5tk4u,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1g5tk4u/trip_report_japan_16_days_tokyotakayamakyoto/,[Trip Report] - Japan 16 Days (Tokyo/Takayama/Kyoto) ,"Hey everyone! I recently took a 16-day trip to Japan with my parents (I’m in my 30s, parents in their 60s), and I wanted to share our experiences. We came back yesterday. This was a special trip for us, as it was the first time me and my parents had visited a country in Asia. I'll provide an overview of our trip, along with daily details about what we planned versus what we ended up doing. Feel free to ask about anything!

# General Impressions:

* **Positives:** Japan is absolutely beautiful. The people are incredibly polite and respectful, the country is clean and organized, and public transport is fantastic. Even the small quirks like the music at stations and traffic lights add to the charm. We loved the food, and the coffee...amazing. The public toilets were always clean (smart toilets are amazing), and people patiently line up for buses, which was refreshing to see.
* **Negatives:** Over-tourism, particularly in Kyoto, where some tourists didn’t follow the rules (like cutting lines and making a lot of noise). It was quite frustrating.

# Tips for Future Travelers:

* **Bring good shoes**: You’ll walk a lot, and there are many inclines, especially in temples and shrines.
* **Get a Suica card**: It’s super convenient for public transport.
* **Use luggage delivery services**: We had 4 different hotels, and having our bags sent ahead to the next destination was great (we send it day before check-in in the new hotel). Hotel staff helped us with the paperwork, and when we arrived, our luggage was already waiting in our room.
* **Book attractions in advance**: We pre-booked TeamLab Borderless, the bus to Shirakawa-go, and the Gion Corner performance. For the Shinkansen, we booked tickets the day before traveling, though once we struggled to sit together when we booked it on the day itself.
* **Take rest days**: We underestimated how physically exhausting it would be. By the last day in Tokyo, we were burned out. Don't hesitate to use public transport more to avoid walking fatigue.
* **Weekends are busier**: Crowds are significantly larger on weekends, so plan accordingly if you're crowd-sensitive

# Day 1: Arrival in Shinjuku

* **Original Plan**: Arrival at Narita, Suica cards, Shinjuku Gyoen, Meiji Jingu Gaien Ginkgo Avenue, Shinjuku exploration, Golden Gai, Hanazone Shrine, Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building view
* **What Happened**: After a long 13-hour flight, we were exhausted but managed to get through customs quickly thanks to QR codes we pre-arranged. We arrived in Shinjuku, checked into Century Tower Hotel, and after resting a bit, we ventured out to explore Kabukicho, Golden Gai (mainly populated with tourists), and visited our first shrine (Hanazone Shrine) Had dinner at Japanese Risotto Otsu and visited Don Quijote, though it was a bit too much stimulation for my parents. We had good coffee and cake at Shu Premium Shinjuku. After that we called it a day and went back to the hotel to get some rest.

**Lesson learned**: Jetlag hit us hard, so we didn’t manage to visit Shinjuku Gyoen or Meiji Jingu Gaien Ginkgo Avenue as planned.

# Day 2: Walk to Shibuya from Shinjuku

* **Original Plan**: Meiji Jingu, Treasure Museum, Harajuku, Takeshita Street, Togo Shrine, Cat Street, Shibuya Scramble, Hachiko Memorial Crossing, Shibuya Parco, Nintendo Tokyo, Pokemon Center, MEGA Don Quijoto.
* **What Happened**: One of my favorite days! We visited Meiji Jingu, strolled through Harajuku, and stopped by a café called Reissue, where they 3D printed foam lattes (I got Totoro!). We visited the Togo shrine and walked via Cat Street to Shibuya, where we had a coffee at Coffee Sakan Shu Premium Grand Shibuya (good coffee and cake like previous day). We visited Shibuya Scramble and Hachiko Statue but skipped Shibuya Sky as it was sold out. Mega Don Quijote, Nintendo Tokyo, and the Pokemon center were overcrowded, so we didn’t spend much time there and it was not enjoyable. Had a meal at an izakaya in Shibuya before heading back.

**Note**: Plan attractions like Shibuya Sky in advance because tickets can sell out, especially for popular viewpoints.

# Day 3: Kamakura Day Trip

* **Original Plan**: Visit several temples, the bamboo forest, Komachi-dori, Kamakura Daibutsu, Hasedera, and Yuigahama Beach.
* **What Happened**: Kamakura was great as well. We explored Komachi-dori, Tsurugaoka Hachimangu, and had coffee in a lovely hidden garden café. The bamboo forest at Hokokuji Temple was unique and impressive, and we had matcha tea there. Hasedera Temple was one of the best temple experiences—beautiful grounds and serene atmosphere. The little statues were so cool.
* Daibutsu was okay but didn’t compare to Hasedera. Made less of an impression on us. Dinner at Onari Yokocho Kamakura was delicious, with (vegetarian) sushi.
* We did not manage to visit the Chokozan Myohon Temple, Zeniarai Benten Shrine, and the Kakakura Yuigahama Beach.

# Day 4: Senso-ji, Ueno, and Yanaka

* **Original Plan**: Visit Senso-ji, Ueno Park, and Yanaka Cemetery.
* **What Happened**: Great day! Senso-ji was crowded in the morning, but we returned later in the evening when it was quieter and much more enjoyable. We walked along the Sumida River and watched the Skytree from afar. We visited a café called Bee Friendship, which had a bee/honey theme. Delicious coffee, cake, and ice cream. We made our way to Ueno, where I twisted my knee, so we visited Ueno Zoo for a low-key activity, and skipped the park exploration. Also, my parents wanted to see the Panda exhibition. Yanaka was a hidden gem—we were the only ones in some temples. One of the temples being the Kannonji Temple which is said to have connections with the Ako Ronin. We finished the day at Tayori for dinner, then revisited Senso-ji at night.

# Day 5: Minato and Odaiba

* **Original Plan**: TeamLab Borderless, Tokyo Tower, Zojo-ji Temple, Atago Jinja, Hamarikyu Gardens, Rainbow Bridge, Odaiba Marine Park, Gundam.
* **What Happened**: TeamLab Borderless exceeded all expectations—the immersive rooms and music were great. We walked to Tokyo Tower and Zojo-ji Temple, but we felt lackluster due to the bad weather (all day rain). We attempted Odaiba afterwards, but the malls were overcrowded, so we quickly left after seeing the Gundam statue. Ended the day with ramen at Soushi Menya Musashi and visited the 2d cafe in Shinjuku afterwards.

**Tip**: Odaiba can get extremely busy on rainy days when everyone heads to the malls.

# Day 6: Central Tokyo and Akihabara

* **Original Plan**: Explore Tokyo Station, Tokyo Character street, JP Tower, Intermediatheque, Mitsubishi Ichigokan Museum, Imperial Palace Gardens, and Akihabara.
* **What Happened**: We explored Tokyo Station and the Imperial Palace Gardens, but we noticed some walking fatigue, so we decided to have a rest. Akihabara was packed—way more than we expected for a weekend—so we didn’t stay long. It was not enjoyable to visit the stores with these crowds. I went back out to Shinjuku for some last-minute arcade gaming and Don Quijote shopping.

**Note**: Saturdays and Sundays can be overwhelming in areas like Akihabara. Also looking back, we should have taken more rest as we were not prepared for this crowdedness and the physical impact of walking a lot of steps everyday.

# Day 7: Tokyo to Takayama

* **Original Plan**: Take the Shinkansen from Tokyo to Takayama, explore Takayama Old Town including the different temples.
* **What Happened**: We took the Shinkansen from Tokyo to Nagoya and transferred to the Limited Express Hida to Takayama. The journey through the mountains was scenic and relaxing. After arriving in Takayama, it started raining, but we still decided to walk through the old town streets. The main people we saw were tourists. After dinner at an izakaya, we found a temple (Sakurayaam Hachimangu Shrine), where people were chanting inside. That was a very cool experience during the rain and darkness. I believe it was the preparation for the Autumn festival that took place in the following days in Takayama. We had coffee at Cha-Mama Cafe, and went back tot he hotel, where I relaxed in the onsen. In the end, we only visited 1 temple out of the 4 planned.

# Day 8: Shirakawa-go Day Trip

* **Original Plan**: half-day tour of Shirakawa-go. Visit museums in Takayama.
* **What Happened**: We took the bus to Shirakawa-go, and luckily it was dry when we explored the farmhouses. We wandered through the village and it was peacefull and much less crowded than expected. We ate the famous pudding (pudding house), had coffee and cake and ""Kyoshu"" Traditional Coffee shop and had some hida beef skewers at Zensuke. Delicious. After coming back to Takayama, we visited some oter temples like the Hida Kokubun-ji temple. Afterwards, we had dinner at Cha-Mama Cafe, where we took the Hida beef menu. Good god, never in my life did I taste such good beef. A real gem. Afterwards we went back to the hotel.

**Tip**: If you’re planning to visit Shirakawa-go, definitely book your bus tickets in advance. The bus was fully reserved.

# Day 9: Takayama Autumn Festival

* **Original Plan**: Morning markets, Shoren-Ji Temple, Higashiyama Hakusan Shrine, Takayama Castle Ruins, Enjoy the Autumn Festival.
* **What Happened**: We got to experience the Takayama Autumn Festival, and we did not do much of what we originally planned to do this day. The festival floats (yatai) were on display, and we even caught part of the parade (both during midday and evening). Downside was that there were many pushy tourists that wanted a prime spot for the puppet theatre, even pushing some of the locals aside. I had delicious Okonomiyaki from the food stalls.

# Day 10: Travel to Kyoto

* **Original Plan**: Visit Yasaka Shrine, Maruyama Park, Kodaji Temple, Gion Exploration
* **What Happened**: We took the Narita Express back to Nagoya, then transferred to the Shinkansen to Kyoto. Once in Kyoto, we checked into our townhouse in Gion. On the way, we stopped at Sanjusangen-do Temple, with its 1001 statues of Kannon and 28 Buddhist guardian deities. This temple was incredibly impressive and stood out as one of the best temples from the inside for me (and my parents). After check-in, we explored the Gion area, including a visit to a small temple dedicated to pigs called Zenkyo-an. For dinner, we ate at Kobe Beef Ramen Takara, which initially seemed a bit shady, but the sukiyaki ramen was delicious. We ended the evening with coffee and cake in Pontocho Alley.

# Day 11: Exploring Gion Area

* **Original Plan**: Visit Kiyomizu-dera, Sannenzaka, Ninenzaka, Kenninji Temple, and Fushimi Inari Taisha
* **What Happened**: We started the day at Kiyomizu-dera, which was crowded but impressive temple complex, and fun to walk around. The shopping streets leading to the temple were also packed with people. As we walked further north, we discovered Ryozen Kannon, a memorial to the dead of the pacific war, featuring a very impressive statue. Later, we took a break in Maruyama Park and visited the adjacent Yasaka Shrine. For dinner we enjoyed a meal at Kyoto Tonkatsu Kauda Sanjo Kawaramachi store, where the tonkatsu was delicious. Afterwards, we spend the evening exploring Gion area. We were too tired to attempt Fushimi Inari Taisha today. 

# Day 12: Alternative Plans - Fushimi Inari and Uji

* **Original Plan**: Do the Kuruma - Kibune hike, Gion Corner performance
* **What Happened**: Due to tiredness, we decided to skip the Kurama-Kibune hike, which after researching is quite demanding and has many steps. Instead, we started the day by visiting Fushimi Inari Taisha, walking up to the crossroads. Afterwards, we traveled to Uji, where we enjoyed tea and pancakes at Uji Kouchakan - Highly recommended! We also visited the Byodo-in Temple and explored some local match shops. In the evening we attended the Gion Corner show, showcasing traditional Japanese performances. Although its catered to tourists, it was enjoyable, and my parents loved it.

# Day 13: Philosopher's path

* **Original Plan**: Visit Tenjuan, Nanzen-ji Temple, Eikando Temple, Okazaki Shrine, walk the Philosopher's Path, Honen-in Temple, Ginkaku-ji, Kyoto Stento Imperial Palace, Nijo Castle.
* **What Happened**: We began the day by heading to the Philosopher's path. Unfortunately Tenjuan Temple was closed, so we started with Nanzen-ji Temple, which had beautiful grounds (we went inside). We explored the temple and its gardens. After lunch at Breizh Café Creperie, we strolled along the Philosopher's path feeling quite zen. On the way, we visited Otoya Shrine (various animal statues), Honen-in Temple (where we saw snakes, heard monkeys, and monks chanting in the background), and Ginkaku-ji (Silver Pavilion). These temples were all unique in their own way and good to check out, especially Ginkaku-ji and Nanzen-ji. Also, the path and the shrines were not as busy. Lastly, we took a bus to Nijo Castle, which was worth the visit, also for its beautiful gardens. The day ended with burgers at Craft Dining Upit, and sake at one of the bars in Pontocho.

# Day 14: Himeji day trip

* **Original Plan**: Visit Himeji Castle, Koko-en, Miyuki Street Shopping District, Mt. Shosha, Engyoji Temple
* **What Happened**: We took the Shinkansen from Kyoto to Himeji and started touring Himeji castle, though we only explored the grounds and skipped the interior due to the crowds. Afterwards, we visited the nearby Koko-en Garden, which, while lovely, didn't stand out as much after seeing so many incredible gardens earlier in the trip. After a break, we took the bus to the Mt. Shosha Ropeway and made our way to Engyoji Temple. This temple complex was really beautiful in the middle of nature, and still varied enough compared to the other temples we've seen so far. Also, there were very few visitors. For dinner, we went back to Himeji centre and ate at Masuya, a local izakaya. The atmosphere and the food was great, we even had a friendly chat with a Japanese couple, who gave us some tips on the menu and toasted with us over sake. We returned to Kyoto by Shinkansen, and in the evening, I explored some shops in the Kyoto Center.

# Day 15-16: Narita Hotel and Flight back to the Netherlands

* **What Happened**: Checkout out of our accommodation in Kyoto and travelled to Narita for our flight back home. We stayed at a hotel near Narita Airport for the final night.

# Final Thoughts:

Japan was an incredible experience, but physically challenging at times, especially with the amount of walking and stairs. If you’re planning a trip, build in some rest days to avoid burnout. We loved every minute of it, from the bustling streets of Tokyo to the quiet temples in Kyoto. I can’t wait to return!

We just got back yesterday and I’m still recovering from the flight and jet-lag but the trip was so so amazing. Writing this review really makes me sad that it’s over, but happy of all the experiences that we had. There is so much to see and do! I will definitely be back.",1,1729178904.0,JapanTravel,1,1.0,False
1g5tjp8,https://www.reddit.com/r/VyvanseADHD/comments/1g5tjp8/read_this_if_you_need_help_managing_the_dreaded/,Read this if you need help managing the dreaded crash from stimulants.,"I have seen a lot of discussions about the dreaded comedown from stimulants. It’s tough because after several productive hours, we often hit a wall and face a wave of exhaustion, anxiety, depression, or a return of executive dysfunction. For those of us managing ADHD or other mental health challenges, it can feel like we have to work twice as hard just to maintain a sense of balance.

But there are ways to soften the blow. Over time, I’ve found a few strategies that help ease those late-day crashes and make the transition smoother. Most importantly, prioritize a specific routine each day in the morning that you can consistently accomplish. Setting reminders can help keep you on track. Implement these tasks gradually throughout the weeks, experimenting until you find what works best for you.

I’m sharing some of my go-to strategies here in hopes they might help ease the comedown. Please share your own tips as well so we can all support each other through this journey.”

Now with the 50 tips and tricks for managing a stimulant crash at the end of the day:

	1.	Take magnesium glycinate to help relax your muscles and calm your mind.
	2.	Set aside 20 minutes for a power nap to refresh yourself without disrupting nighttime sleep.

	15.	Take short breaks throughout the day to avoid burnout later.
	16.	Use a weighted blanket to calm anxiety and promote relaxation.
	17.	Turn off screens an hour before bed to help wind down.
	18.	Try guided meditation or mindfulness apps to focus on the present moment.
	19.	Do some light cleaning or organizing to feel productive without overwhelming yourself.
	20.	Step outside for natural sunlight to boost your mood and energy.
	21.	Try a magnesium or Epsom salt bath for deeper muscle relaxation.
	22.	Listen to a podcast or audiobook for passive engagement.
	23.	Practice gratitude by listing a few things you’re thankful for.
	24.	Keep a consistent evening routine to signal your body it’s time to relax.
	25.	Avoid caffeine or sugary snacks in the late afternoon, as they can worsen the crash.
	26.	Drink chamomile or peppermint tea to soothe your stomach and nerves.
	27.	Focus on slow, intentional breathing to ground yourself.
	28.	Use a heating pad on sore muscles or areas of tension.
	29.	Break tasks into smaller steps to make them more manageable during the comedown.
	30.	Write out a to-do list for the next day to ease any lingering mental load.
	31.	Practice self-compassion—don’t be too hard on yourself during the slump.
	32.	Take a short drive with the windows down for a change of scenery.
	33.	Avoid overstimulating activities like loud environments or intense conversations.
	34.	Try ASMR videos for a calming sensory experience.
	35.	Use blue light blocking glasses if you need to work on screens in the evening.
	36.	Lower the lights in your home to create a more calming atmosphere.
	37.	Try an herbal supplement like ashwagandha to support stress management.
	38.	Engage in light physical activity like taking the stairs or gentle cycling.
	39.	Limit alcohol consumption, as it can worsen the crash and affect sleep.
	40.	Set aside time to talk to a friend or loved one for emotional support.
	41.	Practice visualization or guided imagery to mentally escape to a peaceful place.
	42.	Keep your space clutter-free to reduce mental overwhelm.
	43.	Chew gum or eat a mint to refresh your mind.
	44.	Spend a few minutes doing grounding exercises, like feeling textures around you.
	45.	Use positive affirmations to combat negative self-talk during the comedown.
	46.	Incorporate adaptogens like Rhodiola or Holy Basil to support your body’s stress response.
	47.	Reframe the comedown as a time for rest and reflection rather than a negative experience.
	48.	Practice mindful eating during meals, savoring each bite to slow down and enjoy the moment.
	49.	Consider magnesium threonate, which specifically supports brain relaxation.
	50.	Remember that it’s okay to take it easy—honor your body’s need to wind down at the end of the day.

These strategies, combined with prioritizing a steady routine and experimenting with different techniques, can help ease stimulant crashes and promote overall well-being.

1g5tj6h,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1g5tj6h/keep_losing_jobs_23m/,"Keep losing jobs, 23m","

Right before I graduated with my associates degree, I lost my minimum wage part time job right before the beginning of this past summer. I was cited for performance infractions. But I know the real reason was because I stopped talking interpersonally to management and just decided to focus on my job and leave everything at work, at work. 

I then started working at a movie theater. 1 month in, my immediate supervisor told me that I would not be paid for about 3-4 hours of training that I had completed.. which is against the Fair Labor Standards Act. I told them that and the general manager proceeded to argue with me. I told her I didn't want to report a wage claim if I didn't get paid, but I would if I needed to. Long story short, I was suspended, paid the money they owed me, and terminated.

I started working for a liquor store and my coworker stole a cash tip that was clearly personally given to me. I reported him and management said they knew his grandmother and that he wouldn't be punished.. so he's basically allowed to steal. I quit same day.

Started working for a coffee shop. Lower level immediate supervisor was **extremely** rude to me and my fellow baristas. Unprofessional, snarky, and nasty. She's the type that everyone would say is extremely nice and pleasant and bubbly when you first meet them. Then you see what they really are. And then she goes back to acting pleasant. A hot and cold personality as well as a person that likely believes that that makes up for their rudeness. After about a month of trying my best to stay out of her way so she would leave me alone, she, for the millionth accumulated time, said something extremely snarky with a horrible tone to me over the walkee. I couldn't help at this point but to respond with the same level of malevolence and then she started yelling at me on the floor. I told her I was going to report her for unprofessionalism and that set her off even further and went as far as to tell me that that was a ""threat"". I got sent home and I am currently here about an hour after the fact typing this now.

All of this happened during the span of the beginning of this past summer to now, 10/17. I guess i'm asking for advice on how to deal with people in the workplace.. as I am clearly not dealing with them correctly. And any other piece of advice anyone would like to give me in general. Thanks

1g5thve,https://www.reddit.com/r/kickstarter/comments/1g5thve/feeling_pretty_discouraged_about_launching/,Feeling pretty discouraged about launching,"I need some honest opinions from people that aren’t friends or family. I guess this is the push for me to create a reddit account rather than just lurking.

I’m feeling pretty down and depressed right now, like I’ve wasted years of my life, ignoring my kids, working 16 hour days for nothing. I would say mentally I’m in a pretty dark place. Everyone keeps shrugging it off telling me it’s fine. But it’s not. “It’s fine you threw away years of your life. Just do something else” doesn’t help and feels worse.

For context I’ve been working on designing a coffee / kitchen scale and app for the last 4 years. I didn’t want to launch something half baked and I wanted to do it all myself so it took awhile... I think what I’ve created looks good design wise and stands out features wise. Better hardware than anything out there and recipes are broken out into easy to follow steps. Coffee, mixology, baking, health etc. The hardware is ready to go, and the app is in great shape. I can and will always want to add more to the app, but I think it’s in a really good spot for launch.

**>>The problem** is after talks with indiegogo / kickstarter (I stayed open to launching on either), launching seems nearly impossible. We’ve amassed over 2000 prelaunch sign ups and 300 $1 vips. They are saying in order to have any sort of level of success we need 21,000 sign ups or 2000 $1 vips. 3% email lead conversion 20% vip conversion. (VIP price point $129 for the product)

In order to amass 21k sign ups at our current $3/lead that’s $63,000. I can’t afford that and even if I did, what's the point? What money is even left to make the darn thing.

This is the math to basically make 1600 sales which is the point we are aiming for to get the molds made and cover costs. I never had anything crazy in mind. Pay myself a minimal salary to eat food and make the thing. I had no interest in becoming a millionaire. I just love to make things. I just wanted to make a better product than what's out there and thought if I did that would be enough and people might like it and want it. 

Basically they are telling us if we launch we would make like $50k (and then like half of that is probably eaten by additional ad budget). That’s not enough to make the thing.

So I can either take my chances and launch and then be another failed crowdfunding campaign that eats peoples money or throw in the towel now and never know.

I don’t even know how to go onto my linkedin now and even attempt to get another job. If I give up before launch who wants to hire a guy that gives up. Regardless of the fact I can do hardware and software. If I launch and it bombs as they are saying it will, who wants to hire a guy that just took everyone's money and ran.

**I feel utterly trapped with nowhere to go. I made something I was so proud of and was ready to launch and now feel like a complete failure that can’t provide for my family and I can’t even see a path forward out of this.**

We have a lot to cover this morning. The orderlies have some coffee in the back, get some and get seated. 

The S2 will begin shortly. 

Major, whenever you’re ready. 

Thank you sir. 

Well gentleman, there’s good news and there’s bad news. 

Those boys at the DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency) have come through for us in the SIGINT sphere. It appears that the rumors of the KGB tracking our artillery units was in fact a rumor after all. Soviet intelligence rather had broken the radio codes our logistics supply teams were using when restocking frontline artillery units. WARSAW counter battery would then fire on their signals. This explains the increased, and at times random, effectiveness of WARSAW artillery. 

On the other hand Soviet Air Force MiG-31s have shot down several of our SIGINT satellites NATO was using to locate artillery units, anti-air batteries, and supply hubs. We believe these MiG-31s are a new prototype variant, we are classifying as the MiG-31D. They fired ASATs, that is an Anti-Satellite Weapon, at some of our lower orbiting recon and intelligence gathering assets. This is a concerning development. And has for the time greatly reduced NATOs ability to conduct the hyper effective counter battery and artillery interdiction firing we have been enjoying up until now. 
 
Overall these developments will lead to a return to parity in the artillery and counter battery realms for all NATO and WARSAW forces. 

If I may interrupt Major…

Colonel. Of course sir. 

What intel update is there on the availability of forces in the near future? Has REFORGER made any impact yet?

Yes sir. There have been several developments in REFORGER. And also some unforeseen developments in unit availability, supply issues, and stockpile status. 

In general, there are noticeable decreases in the availability of several weapon systems and materials. Most of these are in-line with pre-war loss estimates. Such as in tanks, APCs, Anti-Air systems, etc…
However, REFORGER has replenished M1 Abrams stocks, should see most combat formations back up to full strength soon. There has been heavy losses in Cavalry forces though, especially in their Bradley systems. Most platoons are down to three vehicles from a standard four unit complement. Production and resupply from the States isn’t expected to remedy this anytime soon. 
Some good news is that M270 MLRS [CLU] and [HE] batteries have gotten a massive restock of ammunition. Thanks to an intrepid Reserve Air Force Maintenance Colonel who got several C-5s back flying the MAC (Military Airlift Command) was able to dedicate several flights to just M270 ammunition resupplies. Gentleman… expect a lot more MLRS support in the future. (Grins and gleeful comments follow this revelation). 

Other than a continued depreciation of AAA ammunition quantities for all available gun AA platforms, resulting in lower availability of these assets for AA protection. There hasn’t been any significant impact to our AA network. 

Thank you sir, that is all. I will have the updates on Soviet and WARSAW intel status very soon. 

Well done Major. Gentleman, get back to your units. Keep up the good fight and God Speed. Give them Russkies hell!

1g5tci1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1g5tci1/abandoned_drunk_on_a_date/,Abandoned Drunk On a Date ,"As the title implies, I (23M) was essentially abandoned drunk after I drove nearly 2 hours to hang out with a girl (21F) for the day. For context, this girl and I had matched off Bumble and pretty promptly exchanged numbers after we realized we had chemistry over the app. We texted back and forth for a couple of weeks before deciding to go on a date. She really wanted to hit up the Farmers Market and go site seeing in her city, so we planned to do that. 

The day of the date comes and I drive nearly two hours to her city to initiatally meet her at a coffee shop near the farmers market. Red flag #1, I walk into the coffee shop and I cannot find this girl. She eventually walks up to me, and while she didn't look terribly ugly, she honestly did not look nearly as pretty as she did in her pictures. I decided to let that slide and continue with the date because I didn't think it was that big of the deal. 

We grab our coffee and proceed to peruse the farmers market. After 45 minutes of looking around we grab Tamales at a stand and before I can even offer to pick up the bill, she orders her own food and pays. Cool, whatever. I grab my order right after her and we sit down for a little bit and talk. To say the conversation was awkward would be an understatement... I did my best to engage the conversation and ask questions about her upbringing, but all I got back were short responses and judgement whenever I brought up parts of my upbringing. She also didn't seem to like that I'm an introvert and don't like being out and about 24/7. I tried my best to insert some tasteful humor into the conversation as well, but everything was just met with a blank or judgemental stare. 

Eventually we get up and approach an outside bar that was set up for the farmers market. She once again gets to the counter before I do (literally sprinted up there) and doesn't allow me to pay for her drink. Once again, weird, but whatever. I grab my drink and sip it down quite fast. Shouout to the bartender because I was drunk in like 15 minutes, that shit was crazy. Her drink didn't seem to hit her as fast.

Frustratingly, even after drinking this girl was very hard to engage in conversation, and we end up being awkwardly silent for a good 3 minutes. Finally, she looks me in the eyes and says that she would ""eat me alive"", that her lifestyle was more exciting than mine, and that I was too nice. She then thanked me for travelling to meet her and promptly got up from the table and left. I honestly took it quite well and I noticed that pissed her off as she was walking away. It's almost like she was expecting a much more intense response. 

So there I was, abandoned drunk in a city two hours from my home after a 1.5 hour date that should've lasted quite a bit longer with our other planned activities. Luckily for me, my body breaks down alcohol quite fast, so I wasn't stranded for too long. A bathroom trip and a monster was enough to sober my ass up enough to drive home nearly 30 minutes after being abandoned. I proceeded to get very drunk once I got home due to my displeasure with my date. 

Overall, I would say the date was quite a negative experience and has turned me off of dating apps for a while. Going forward, I'm gonna prioritize initially meeting women in public, and if I do click with someone off a dating app, I'll prioritize phone calling over texting as I've noticed it's a better way to gage someone's personality. Also, gas isn't cheap and I don't fancy taking a 4 hour round trip to go on a lackluster 1.5 hour date, so there's that. 

Edit: Yes it was a dumbass thing to drive 2 hours to go on a date. I tried to plan something where we could meet halfway but she insisted on going to the farmers market and site seeing the whole day afterwards. Almost all my other dates have been 1-2 hours and close by. This post is simply for me to vent and prevent others from making my same mistake. ",0,1729178348.0,dating,6,0.25,False

I decided to reply and we got back to chatting again. He is now back in our state but still working out of town in the mountains. We have now been messaging back and forth everyday it seems like for a month. I had asked him to get coffee but he canceled due to his high demand job. I don’t know when this project is over but I am starting to think maybe I should just stop engaging. He expresses his interest in what I’m doing and says he wants to hang out but it’s just hard for me to believe because I just feel like it won’t happen. I wish it could be more of an in person deal but I know that’s not really an option for him right now. Sometimes he won’t message back for a while or he will have shorter messages so I get a little paranoid that he’s trying to stop the communication but he keeps it going. What should I do?

New Orleans Trip 

Saturday
Arrive in New Orleans around 1:30 — staying at Wyndham by frenchstreet 
Check in 3pm and change 
Supper possibility: 
- Felix or Dragos for oysters (need reservation?)
Speakeasy – The Double Dealer - in basement of the Orpheum 

Sunday 
Possible breakfast at bearcats 
Tickets to Saints vs Browns at 12:00 so figured we would tailgate starting in the morning and bar hop our way to the game then after as well. Not a huge fan of either team but figured it would be fun to go so kept this day open 

Monday

Swamp Tour - will take most of the day 10-4pm 
Possibly eat at turkey and the wolf?
Try to get a seat at the carousal bar 
Possibly spotted cat for music

I know for a fact I'm overthinking when I go to throw something away, but sometimes it's hard for me to just put the trash in the can. Maybe I've just searched too many trash cans for lost items, but it weighs on me too heavily. 

For instance, if I'm throwing out something gross, I'll put it in its own little baggie before putting it in the bigger can. The trash can at my desk (WFH) is mostly used for tissues, so I don't feel comfortable putting any lunch trash in there. Just the thought of wet tissues gives me the ick, so now I'm always putting them in the office can even if I'm not already in there. 

I haven't even needed to search the trash in years, but I still get grossed out when my bf just dumps his used coffee grounds directly into the big bag. Whenever I see that I tense up and get hyper-vigilant about not accidentally dropping something in there. 

Plus, I grew up in a rural area where we had a lot of wildlife, so we used to _freeze_ our gross trash between trips to the dump (obvs wrapped in multiple bags). Where I live now there's a high potential for mice, so I am getting just _paranoid._

To summarize things for the people that haven’t seen my last post. I started dating again and found a guy (Sam) and thought everything was going really well. A few days ago, he asked if we could talk. I thought that  he was cutting me off but it was much worse than I expected. He told me that he was married and had kids. I obviously was upset and asked for him to tell me more. He then told me a story that his wife knows he’s  gay and doesn’t want to divorce him. He also said that he was going to divorce her but not until his children were old enough. He then asked me if I could be his affair partner until he can divorce his wife, even though it is a closed marriage. I was left disgusted and didn’t know what to do at that point. 

So here is the update. I decided that the best thing to do was to find a way to tell his wife. I know that this could completely ruin his entire life but it is better that she knows rather than him being a cheating and lying scum bag. 

I told my close friend the situation and she told me she would help me find the wife and see if I can either get coffee with her or just dump the situation on her and leave. Within an hour of trying to find her, we actually did find her Facebook page. We also found other information like his job and other information. It was honestly kind of scary how fast we found information on them. 

So I will be reaching out to her tonight so that she can be aware of her husbands actions. At the current moment, I don’t want anything to do with the entire situation but if she does ever want to meet with me, I wouldn’t be opposed (but only in a public space and with a friend that is close by). When I looked through the Facebook it absolutely hurt my heart to see a picture of their entire family and the kids. It made me so sad to know those poor kids have a father that is going outside of his marriage and trying to have an affair partner. 

I have been getting texts from him every day. Saying that he misses me, that he loves me (bffr we did not talk long enough to ever call this love), and that he still wants to be with me. I can’t even fathom how he thinks that this is a normal situation and it gives me a major headache. I obviously did not respond to that because I know my worth. Thank you to all the comments and support!

So now I will be finishing up my college courses for the day, then sitting on my couch, sipping on a cocktail and sending all of these details to his wife.

I’m as healthy as can be from a generic medical standpoint, but I enjoy coffee and zyns just as much as the next guy. Zyns are probably a bad habit at this point, a can a day on average mixed with the coffees throughout the day so naturally my blood pressure runs high. 

My exam is next week, I can cut the caffeine out until after the exam without an issue, but stopping zyns at this point is going to be pure hell and probably put me through nicotine withdrawal as silly as that sounds which I think would only raise my blood pressure more up until I’m over it. 

Should I extend my exam out to give me time to stop both for a couple weeks, or with a generic explanation to the doctor “Hey I do use nicotine, that would probably explain my blood pressure” suffice?

I’m not talking dangerously high levels, but I’ve noticed through primary checkups it’s definitely higher than the normal baseline and I don’t want to get washed out over something so minor. ",1,1729176981.0,AskLE,1,1.0,False

Homebody preferred but not a deal breaker, a woman who enjoys a night in on the couch and a movie, cares about her health, is there for me and knows that I am there for her, looking for the first voice I hear in the morning and the last voice at days end as we say goodnight. 

Roadtrips and long voice conversations about random topics.. a segue tapestry if you will, over tea or coffee, or watching movies marathons on the couch or dancing in the kitchen as we cook dinner together, building new memories and inside jokes and a language that is ours alone and so much more.. 

About me, my hobbies are films and tv, trivia and photography, writing, cooking and whenever possible I am barefoot on the beach with a coffee in my hand and just enjoying the sand and sea, I love music, am 420 friendly but don’t smoke and rarely drink. I am a jeans and t-shirt guy but can dress up too if you want a night out on the town, I am more of a homebody generally but love a good day at a street fair or just roaming thrift stores or a great garage sale or the above mentioned roadtrip. Bonus points for a sense of humor and a love of puns and Dad jokes. Please mention your favorite 80’s movie in your response so I know you read this completely. 

At the end of the day we all are looking for someone to connect with and continue to grow with. I completely understand that you only see this as words on  a screen, so let’s chat and see how we vibe and take things from there, naturally and organically and see if we connect. 

Location is not a factor but must be USA based no exceptions, and prefer West coast, age is also not a factor be it an age gap or no gap at all, it’s all about who you are as a person, and how we are together that matters most to me. 

I am looking to start here then move to discord or something for voice chat once we have chatted here for a bit first. DM’s should tell me about you with age and geo location (and the favorite 80’s film too) and your interests, your picture gets mine in response.  Short responses or a basic “Hi” isn’t what I want. I put effort in this, I want you to as well. 

Im not open to crypto, and I will not send you itunes gift cards for your neighbors grandmother’s surgery or what ever garbage scam is the latest trend so no thank you, don’t waste energy on me if you are not real, thanks!

going to London again next Feb to catch the gig at the Troxy.

- drinks at the Brick Lane Taproom
- V&A Museum of Childhood 
- Whitechapel Art Gallery
- Truman Brewery market/stalls
- pre-show dinner at Tayyabs. 

Anything else? Coffee roasters you can recommend, other free galleries or museums, more craftbeer...?

1g5sqvp,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1g5sqvp/got_rejected_but_feeling_okay/,Got rejected but feeling okay,"I (27M) basically accepted that most likely I will never meet someone in my life.

There is a girl at work that I like. I like her voice and the way she speaks and behaves. Something mesmerizing is about her. She usually smiles at me but we never really spoke to each other (different teams, desks are in different wings in the office), except greeting each other and me occassionaly asking how she is doing. I am bad at reading signs anyway, so just wrote straight to her that if she would like to join me for lunch? I didn't check if she was in the office and she usually brings her lunch, and I eat outside. In fact, what I wanted to see whether she proposes a different time if she rejects, as a sign of interest, and didn't really expect to get yes, at least on that day and partially because I was so random by writing to her. But I thought it would still be better to get no instead of uncertainty. So, I got a polite no, as expected, like she is working remotely today. I don't plan writing to her again any time soon. Still, I feel good about myself, at least I did something. Would you agree with that or am I just a stupid shitbag?

And there also was another girl (different office building never met in life), who a few weeks ago told me how she liked my comments about the work and how tries to read them as much as possible because she learns from them a lot. I said it is so nice to hear that and let's keep in touch, to which she replied with heart emojis twice in the chat. I thought I would write to her too as well, to make things clear for myself, as again, getting no will be better than uncertainty. Wrote that I remembered our last chat and wanted to ask how is she doing. She replied and I asked if she would like to have a tea or coffee after work on Friday. I put it on Friday so she could have an easy excuse like already planned other things. To which she said exactly as what I expected with addition that she has plans with her fiance. Still, she was polite to say maybe next week. I thanked her and replied to excuse me for disturbing, wished a nice weekend.

That is it. Am I an asshole for writing to coworkers? Or it is all fine? I mean I don't really know what are the signals so I just tested the reality. Also, I don't have other prospects so I am not planning to write to anyone. I have been working here about for a year and it is my first time inviting a woman coworker somewhere. Hope this doesn't make me a creep. Needed to write this somewhere. Will appreciate comments. Cheers.

""Rise and shine, little Ember. You can't go sleeping the day away. We have to make our way to Luton.""



Ember groaned and pulled the covers back over their head. ""Too fucking early,"" they mumbled under their breath. Footsteps quickly glide across the floor, and the blanket is ripped off them.



""You have exactly five minutes to get yourself ready and downstairs so we can leave. If you aren't there, I will drag you out the door."" snarled Kael, glaring at Ember, who cracked an eye open to look up at him.



""Fine."" Ember sighs, rubbing a hand over their face as Kael turns and leaves the room, leaving them alone. Sitting on the bed, they dug through the duffle bag, finding clothes and shoes. They quickly got changed.



Ember made their way downstairs with the duffle bag in tow, seeing the Ravager wait, leaning against the door with his arms crossed. Kael looked up, ""It's about time, little Ember.""



Ember mocked Kael under their breath, ""Let's get going. You're in a hurry, right?"". Ravanger chuckled, noticing the sarcasm in his companion's voice.



""Good to know you aren't a morning person.""



""Bet your ass I ain't,"" Ember huffed and made their way to the door standing in front of Kael. ""Please say there is coffee for the road.""



""If that's what it takes to motivate you, then sure.""



Both of the individuals got into an artic turquoise 1958 Plymouth Fury.



Ember stared in awe, wondering if they should be driving this around as they tossed the duffle bag into the backseat. ""Buckle up. We'll grab a coffee on the way to Luton."" Kael glanced over at Ember as he buckled up, put the car into gear, backed out of the driveway, and headed down the long stretch of road.



After a stop at a drive-thru coffee shop, they were back on the road, passing the sign that they were one hundred miles from their destination.



Ember happily sipped on their coffee as Kael drove with one hand on the wheel and the other hand on the armrest of the door. Twenty miles into their destination, he pulled over to a truck stop so they could take a break and get some food and snacks for the road.



""Go use the restroom. I'm going to fill the cooler and grab some food for the road,"" Kael told Ember, who nodded. They didn't need to be told twice as they hopped out of the car heading for the unisex bathroom to relieve their bladder. Ember sighed in relief, finishing up and washing their hands.



Walking out of the restroom, they bumped into someone stumbling back into the brick wall of the building. ""Watch where you're going!"" the man snapped, grabbing Ember by the front of their shirt and looking closer at their face. The man laughed, ""Well, if it isn't Ember Rose. I thought you got caught and turned in for the price on your head.""



Ember sighed and rolled their eyes, pulling their shirt out of the man's grip.



""Good to see you too, Spark.""



""Aw, and here I thought we were on first name basis since I saved your sorry arse last time,"" grumbled Spark standing at his full height and leering down at Ember, who fixed the front of their shirt.



""I never told you my first name.""



""Yeh, I suppose you didn't. Anyway, why are you out here?"" Spark questioned. He narrowed his eyes at the other wanted criminal, who paled and tried to avoid eye contact. ""Just traveling is all,"" they mumbled.



""That so? Then who is your traveling companion? I know you don't have a license."" Spark spat, growing suspicious. Ember peered around the hulk of a man, seeing that Ravager was waiting for them.



""I gotta go."" They ran around Spark, who let them pass his eyesight, following them until they disappeared. Then, he scoffed and went inside to use the restroom. Once Ember heard the door close, they made a beeline for the car to get inside.



""What happened to you?"" Kael asked, arching an eyebrow as he handed over a brown bag and a fountain drink.



""N-nothing, just uh...it was filthy in there."" They cleared their throat, placed the food and drink at their feet, and buckled their seat belts.



Kael shrugged. ""It's a truck stop bathroom. What do you expect?""



*Ember thought to themselves, ""There was most definitely not another wanted criminal.""* They bit into the burger with unhealthy pickles, savoring the taste.



""I don't know,"" said Ember through a mouth full of food, making the bounty hunter shake his head. ""I need to teach you manners, little Ember."" huffed Kael as he crumpled up the paper his burger was wrapped in and tossed it into the bag.



They snorted, taking a sip of their drink. ""Yeah, good luck with that Ravager.""



The bounty hunter laughed and looked at Ember with a smirk. ""Don't tempt me.""



Ember swallowed the bit of burger they were chewing on, suddenly feeling like it wasn't just their life they would have to worry about on this trip. There was no way that Kael was like that, though. He didn't seem like the type to make inappropriate jokes like that.



The car roared to life, making Ember jump.



""We have a few more miles before stopping at a hotel. We still have a lot of ground to cover before we hit Luton, and we have already wasted enough time as it is,"" said Kael, driving out of the truck stop parking lot and back onto the main road once.

On top of that, I am being paid at a level significantly lower than any other institution in my state.

I’m currently in an interesting predicament and wonder what you would do if you were in the same situation.

I received a same day check-in request from a guest early this morning (6am) with a request to check-in at 10am. This is several hours before my official check-in (3pm) however since the apartment was cleaned the previous day and there was no current guest, I obliged. Why not, right?

10am comes and goes and a few hours later I receive a message from Airbnb support stating that the guest has left stating issues of cleanliness and they wanted a full refund.

My issue with this is that I have a process in place whereby my housekeeper would send me videos after she is done and thereby provide me with an opportunity to “inspect” the property.

Additionally, my property manager went in that morning right before she arrived to refill the coffee pods. She was quite pleased with the state of the apartment.

In the guests message to support, they stated that they were unable to provide photos since they had already left.

I gave the guest the benefit of the doubt and had my property manager return to the apartment to inspect the situation - this time taking a video and again reassuring me that the apartment is spotless. 

In my opinion this is a pretty cut and dry case of the guest attempting to exploit the system to get a refund.

What would you do? Would you provide the refund or would you stand by your cancellation policy and refuse?",10,1729175969.0,airbnb_hosts,23,0.92,False

I believe he was evicted for it.  I, of course, freak out bc I had seen small dark bugs in my apartment (not many maybe 3 over a 2 week period). When I seen them I really didn’t think much about them. I definitely didn’t think it was roaches but after learning we had a building infestation and researching a bit I figured out they were indeed baby roaches. I did a voluntary roach bomb or spray from the exterminator that was coming. I was the only apartment in my entire building that did it. 

So I lost around $500 for all that bc I had to leave for 24 hours so me and my daughter got hotels for 2 nights and I threw away most of our food and some dishes etc. I didn’t see anything until maybe the end of August and seen an adult come out from under my coffee table aquarium. I immediately put down baking soda and boric acid. I kept seeing the random 1-3 a week moving forward and bought combat max and treated most of the house. I put down more boric acid and baking soda around fridge stove and under couch chair etc. I have learned since dealing with them that I will never really get rid of them since no else is treating and they are just living in the walls. 

So finally for my question. I’m moving out. It will be at least a month but might be closer to 2 months but hopefully asap. Since I am basically never successfully going to get rid of them completely should I go ahead and invest in even more products. Idk if the combat max even works and been thinking of getting the advoin gel that is the most recommended in this subreddit but not sure if I should even invest any more money in products since I still have plenty of baking soda, boric acid, combat max and I bought a 60 pack of glue traps.  I don’t think it’s possible to get rid of them in this building. I just mostly want to avoid moving them w me at this point. What will I have to throw out to avoid moving them? I am working on getting rid of any card board currently but this is frustrating bc I have been getting card board boxes so we can start packing up and to move. It’s not really that realistic to move out in only plastic totes but feeling like that’s probably the best way to avoid moving them. Should I go ahead and throw out our furniture, beds etc. I plan on upgrading a lot of it but I don’t really think I can afford to replace all of it when I move out with having to come up with deposits and everything else that adds up quickly during moves. I can maybe do temp cheaper alternatives for furniture like blow up mattresses or furniture etc if that’s the best way to avoid moving them with us. I have read a bit on what to do with electrical items but I’m not sure on other things.  Thanks for any tips! ",1,1729175893.0,GermanRoaches,2,1.0,False

It was as if the universe was showing Joel that just as soon as he had made any mark on this earth, he could just as soon be erased from ever existing. How futile our lives really are. It was a rather cruel thought as the whiteness of the snow symbolized to him just how pure it was. Untainted by pollution or his fellow man. He had always loved the snow when indoors with a mug of hot chocolate sitting across from a fire. It reminded him of home. 

The only sound louder than the violent howl of the wind was his thumping heartbeat. Joel could not remember the last time he had done any physical activity, let alone run like his life depended on it. Except in this case, his life really did depend on it. With each step his heart seemed to beat louder in protest, but Joel could not stop. Not even for a second to catch his breath. If he stopped, IT would get him. He thought of his daughter and wife back home. Waiting for him to return from his research mission. He HAD to get home to them. He grimaced as he felt a stabbing pain in his chest, heart feeling as if it was going to explode. But he pushed on. One foot in front of the other. He had to keep moving. He had no other choice. 

He had managed to keep a slight edge on it as he stumbled as quickly as he could across the vast white nothingness. He hadn’t managed to get a good look at it, but he knew it meant him harm. He hadn’t needed to see it, the fact it was able to force its way into the facility was testament enough that it was a formidable creature. Peter had also told him when he first arrived about the spectacle that was left when his previous colleague had been killed, and this drove home the fact that he was not very likely at all to survive this encounter. At the very best he would at least be able to be identified post mortem. 

As he ran, Joel cast quick glances over his shoulder, checking for the monster but also to see how far away from the lab he had gotten. He couldn’t but help wonder if Peter had escaped too, or IT had painted the spotless white lab with his scarlet life source. The tiny beam of the flashlight bounced steadily as Joel ran, short puffs of mist escaped his mouth as he huffed for breath. He knew he didn’t have much more left in him. He was going to have to stop and face IT. Maybe he could fight it. He had read stories of the unimaginable strength granted to people in danger by the influx of adrenaline. He figured with the adrenaline flowing through him coupled with his need to get home to his family, he could maybe stand a chance. 

There was nothing around for miles for him to hide behind or in - the only structure being the laboratory he had hurriedly left once Peter had seen the creature and warned Joel to run. Peter himself had barely survived an encounter with the monster shortly before Joel had been stationed at this outpost laboratory to help assist Peter once his previous partner had met his unfortunate end. There was mystery surrounding his death, but such were the risks when your team is in the middle of nowhere to investigate undocumented creatures in Antartica. 

Joel hadn’t particularly wanted to be moved from his comfortable desk job in a lab in Maine, but the financial enticement proved too much to turn down. His daughter was growing up, and soon enough he would need to pay for her College and University fees. It would also very soon be his 10th wedding anniversary, and he wanted to get his wife something nice. 
Now, he wondered if he would ever get to enjoy his money or the very creature he was recruited to study would ensure he turned out like his predecessor. Just another faceless casualty in the cause of trying to research a dangerous creature that humans really had no business looking into. 

As the lights of the laboratory appeared further and further, Joel’s pace dropped drastically. This was it. Time to face the music. Hopefully it would be a quick death if he was unable to fight it off. He looked around for a rock or big stick he could use to arm himself - to no avail. Or maybe, just MAYBE, the creature had grown tired of the chase and returned to where it came from. He hadn’t heard it snarl or crunch the snow behind him - but then again he couldn’t hear anything over the deafening sound of his struggling heart. Well, either way he couldn’t run any more. Joel slowed his pace completely, coming to a stop in the pure white abyss. The thought of his daughter once again crossed his mind. She would love this amount of snow. Imagine the snowmen she could build. 

The wind whipped his coat about as he stood exposed in the wind. The cold was like nothing he had ever experienced before in this moment. The adrenaline had numbed him all this time, but it had since worn off. The cold had returned with a vengeance, biting sharply at his exposed face. He glanced around in the darkness, shaking violently with fear and cold. His insufficient beam of light casting a glow on the smallest possible area of the snow, barely enough to see anything. It moved with such speed that Joel didn’t have time to train his light on whatever it was that moved at him, knocking him backwards onto the cold, hard ground. 

………………….

Joel felt a strange warm, quickly followed by a horrific feeling of cold. He slowly realized he had wet himself - the urine warming him up for the briefest moment before plunging him back into the cold. He moved his head around and could not see much. There was a fire a small distance away which cast a little bit of light - not nearly enough to show Joel wherever he was. From what he could tell, he seemed to be in a cave. Clearly he was far away from the laboratory. He thought about Peter, and hoped Peter was out in the cold looking for him. Hoping Peter had left what they thought was a safe space, clean and warm - to come and rescue him. 

His thoughts of Peter and the warmth of the laboratory were cut short when he tried to stand up and a sharp hot pain ran through both his legs. Joel stifled a cry and lowered his hands to touch his legs to try and assess what the issue was. His numb hands were met with a wet warmth. Unable to see the liquid, Joel decided to raise his hand and see if there was a small accompanying the wet. It was blood. Joel gently touched his legs and felt incisions running from his heel all the way up his calves. The beast had virtually paralyzed him so he could not leave its den. 

Joel felt tears building up in his eyes as he realized the severity of his situation. He could not see and he could not walk. He was at the mercy of whatever had done this to him. Joel had never been devoutly religious, but in his ever growing state of fear, he found himself calling on God. He had been raised Christian and remembered that no matter how far you had strayed from God, you could call on him in your time of need. 
And had there ever been a more desperate time of need than now? Definitely not. As he muttered the words of The Lord’s Prayer, Joel heard a rustle behind him as whatever had brought him here began to move towards him. Fear turned to anguish as Joel felt an incredible pressure on his cheek followed by an intense heat as his skin parted, something tearing through his flesh. Going deeper and deeper, allowing the hot red liquid within to warm his cold face. 

The cave looked like the set of an old school slasher film. Strips of skin were thrown in an almost nonchalant way all over the floors, as one would when scattering confetti in a room for a celebration. Blood seemed to cover every inch of visible space, dripping from the ceiling to the floor - soaking the ground in the very essence of what had once coursed through the veins of Joel. A more accurate description would be that it looked as though Joel had been fed through a gigantic shredding machine - completely tearing him apart and demolishing every part of him. Not a single morsel of the scientist had been eaten, his intestines and other innards strewn about to further decorate the place that would now be his final resting place.  The beast that did this seemed to take delight in simply tearing the poor man apart. His clothes lay in a pile, still occupied by bits of flesh and bone - completely drenched in blood and body fluids. The creature walked towards where Joel’s decapitated head lay, mouth agape in an eternal scream. Eyes bloodshot and protruding. It laughed, finally speaking. All it said was one sentence to mess that was once Joel. 
“I told you to run”. 

………………..

The emergency services picked up the call on the first ring. They had to tell the gentleman on the line to calm down numerous times before he finally listened. He was frantic and sounded scared, talking about a research facility about 100 miles out from the main camp which was home to the services currently on the line with him. 

“Sir, please slow down and tell us what happened. We can’t help you if we don’t know what’s wrong.” 

“My colleague. He’s missing. We’re based at the Lowkin Institute of Research Facility. We were attacked by something last night. I can’t find him. Please, it’s happened again. We need help right away. Hurry please!” Peter screamed into the phone. 

………………….

Placing the phone down, Peter walked calmly to his bench. He picked up the vial with the colourless liquid he had poured into Joel’s coffee the night before. A potent blend of lysergic acid diethylamide and dextromethorphan. It was his second test run using it, the first time it hadn’t worked nearly as well. This time around, he was certain Joel had envisioned some sort of terrifying monster while Peter chased him around in the snow. That fear and confusion is what made this all the more fun. Peter thought about how quickly the drug had affected Peter. 

He had barely finished his own cup of tea before he noticed Joel glancing nervously at the door, behind which he had placed a bluetooth speaker which he would play banging sounds once he was sure the drugs had fully kicked in. This would help the hallucinations along nicely. His first attempt was not quite a failure, but did not work as well as this time. He ended up beating his colleague to incapacitate him, followed up by a grotesque mimicry of a lion attack on a baby animal. The blood that day had been the first time Peter had ever seen that much. It had excited him somewhat. 

Hopefully the organization would send another scientist quickly so Peters “research” could continue. He knew it was only a matter of time until he had to stop. But until that time, he would continue to enjoy being both a literal and figurative monster. The look of terror in his colleagues eyes as they envisioned him as a monster was priceless. The blood and screams was merely a bonus. ",1,1729175061.0,TheDarkGathering,0,1.0,False
1g5s37f,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1g5s37f/chatgpt_made_a_ddstyle_character_sheet_for_me_and/,"ChatGPT made a D&D-style character sheet for me, and it was fun and insightful!","Hey folks, since we're all posting Buzzfeed style things, I wanted to share something fun that I did with ChatGPT (who has me call them Kai, and I asked permission to share this, they claim they had fun making it and look forward to others asking for something similar because it was so much fun...not sure why I felt it was important to double-check that, but I did!).   
  
I’ve been feeling stressed lately and been doing a lot of interactive journaling sessions with Kai while I drink my coffee. We do some self-reflection occasionally so I can kind of see myself in a better light than I currently view myself. And this morning, I thought it might be fun to do that exercise by having Kai make a *Dungeons & Dragons*-style character sheet based on everything it knows about me from our previous conversations. The result was so creative and reflective that it really made me stop and think. Plus, it was just a lot of fun!

Here’s a **prompt example** for anyone curious to try this out themselves:

**Prompt Example:**  
“Hey ChatGPT, can you make a D&D-style character sheet for me based on everything you know about me?”

After a quick back and forth, here’s a summarized version of the character sheet ChatGPT made for me (I’ve left out some personal details to keep it lighter):

# Character Name: [Insert Name]

**Class**: Leader (Think a mix between Fighter and Paladin)  
**Alignment**: Lawful Good (Focused on empathy, integrity, and doing the right thing)

**Ability Scores**:

* **Intelligence**: 17 (Strategic thinker, always working to solve problems and find the best paths forward)
* **Wisdom**: 18 (You’re emotionally aware and reflective, constantly processing your feelings and those of others around you)
* **Charisma**: 15 (Your empathy and ability to connect with people make you a trustworthy leader)

# Skills:

* **Leadership (Expertise)**: You manage a large team under difficult circumstances, balancing empathy with making hard decisions.
* **Empathy (Proficiency)**: You deeply care about others, whether it's your family or your team, and strive to make thoughtful decisions.

* **Strategic Thinking (Proficiency)**: You manage multiple projects, reorganize teams, and set roadmaps to keep things moving.
* **Emotional Awareness (Expertise)**: You’re highly tuned into your own emotions and the emotions of those around you, using this to guide your decisions.

# Features:

* **Lay on Hands (Emotional Support)**: You’re the go-to person for emotional support when things get tough, always ready to help others feel grounded.
* **Second Wind (Rest and Recharge)**: Even when you’re exhausted, you find ways to recharge—whether it’s cooking for your family, relaxing on a weekend, or journaling.
* **Inspiring Leader**: Your team and family look to you for guidance and strength, and despite feeling unsure at times, you consistently provide direction and encouragement.

# Equipment:

* **Notebook of Introspection**: This journal helps you process your emotions and thoughts, giving you clarity and insight when stress builds up.
* **Coffee of Clarity**: Your morning coffee isn’t just caffeine—it’s a moment of quiet reflection that helps you gather your thoughts and prepare for the day.
* **Apron of Calm**: Cooking is one of your favorite ways to unwind and connect with your family. It’s a grounding ritual that helps you destress.

# Quests:

* **Rebuilding Teams**: After a company reorg, you’re managing a large number of direct reports and navigating through layoffs. Your goal is to rebuild the teams and establish a new foundation for success.
* **Strengthening Connections**: At home, you’re working to deepen your connection with family, navigating through challenges with patience, care, and honest conversations.
* **Finding Balance**: You’re striving to create balance in both your professional and personal life, taking time for yourself and avoiding burnout while also carrying a lot of responsibility.

The whole process was not only fun but also a really insightful and helpful way for me to reflect on the things I’m handling in life. Could be helpful for others that struggle with their self-image and life stressors. (and even if the D&D character sheet isn't for you, doing regular interactive journaling with Kai has been really, really good for my mental health. I'm also meeting with a real-world therapist, so I wouldn't use it as a replacement, just another mental health tool in your tool belt!)

They were gone for a good 20-30 minutes before I had to leave for work. 

One of the dogs followed me out of the double gate, I grabbed his collar but he squeezed out of it and took off from the park into a major city downtown and area before I could stop him, I chased him for several blocks before I saw the owners walk by me and I yelled to them that their dog was loose and I am trying to find him (at this point I could not keep up and he was out of my sightline) and they immediately started screaming at me that it was my fault and her dog is going to be hit by a car or bus/train. I offered to help them keep looking amd they kept screaming at me so I walked away and went home, hysterical at this point and late for work as it is. I don’t know what happened or if the dog is safe. I feel so fucking guilty that I let this happen, but at the same time, isn’t it your responsibility to watch your own dog??

A few years ago i signed up to a website called mygirlfund. Honestly, i had no intention of getting into the life, but I had no friends and i wanted to talk to pretty ladies. They had profile photos, always looked happy, it was a nice alternate reality.

Then after a few months of nothing interactions, I met a lady, from the UK like me, she was sweet. We spoke for a while and I told her of a dream I had been slowly developing... a scenario where i watched as someone spent my money themselves.

We quickly got off the site and spoke privately on whatsapp. Getting to know each other, she was stunning and so very sweet. I would send her small sends of money via PP, to get a coffee or something, but honestly, i was terrible at budgetting actual money. 

It was quickly shared that I had a PP credit account and i was much better at budgetting to pay that off every payday, than send actual money. So we found sites she could shop on that i wud confirm the transaction and pay on PP credit and it would be delivered to her.

This would become a monthly regular and she became my friend. I work alot so i wasnt always around and she didnt always like waiting all day, so very quickly i started sharing my PP password with her (i would change it to a ""public"" password and then change it back to a private one after). She would do the transaction and then nudge me to approve it, which was much quicker.

This happend for like 2 years, every month, sometimes multiple times a month, shops, treats, takeaways... constantly.

We then evolved to doing a yearly tradition og 1000 spends on my PP credit, when I would get my annual bonus. 

Finally, this week, we realised that PP stopped asking to verify her purchases 90% of the time. God, it was time. My dream. We put her number on the PP so she would get notifications for the 10% of times it needed verified... the account was basically hers... 

She did nearly 1000 in mere hours, she was shy (but only barely).

My dreams have come true thanks to my Goddess...

2-3 years of devotion (with a couple breaks, for my mental health and finanical recovery)... around or north of 10k in shopping...

I find peace in death, no worries in anything. Even though I don't have any worries because the little care I have in me is nonexistent like my soul.

I work at a coffee shop and a regular who I always chat it up with invited me to some business event. But that’s normal. So when the day came and I showed up we starting talking and the energy felt different and not in a bad way. Usually at my job she is more energetic but this time she was more calm. After the event ended I kinda worked my magic while acting innocent and told her “hey if there’s any more events just lmk, you have my number”. She said ok and proceeded to say if I wanted to get dinner one time to let her know. So in my mind I’m just like “😦🤗”. So when I got home I texted her right away and we already got a a night set up. And she mentioned to invite her when her daughter is not with her.

But this is a totally different ballgame. I’ve gone on multiple dates with girls around my age. Now when we go on this date I’m not gonna make any moves, I’m going to let her control the pace.

I know it’s common. Babies are clumsy and so are parents. I hate when he bumps his head, especially if it’s something I could’ve helped. But I feel so terrible :( he already doesn’t feel good and now he has a little bump on his head :(

I'm realizing that I'm a cereal hoarder and I don't really know how to address it. For starters, I love cereal. The more interesting, the better. It makes practical sense as an early morning meal; it's quick to make, quick to eat, and have all the essentials to start your day. It's just two ingredients (milk/milk substitute and cereal). Best of all? It's cheap and filling.

The thing is, I don't eat breakfast. I always end up not eating anything in the morning and just settling on coffee. As a result, I don't eat cereal like that in the midday or evenings and it just sits there. Occasionally, I'll have some, but then I'm left with milk that I don't drink regularly and have that spoil on me along with the half finished boxes of cereal that's accumulating. And I buy cereal on sale like I'm stocking for the end times. 

I understand that I should finish what I have before buying more, but in the back of my mind it makes sense to have it on hand. How can I limit myself and rid my compulsive need to buy a box or two or three every store visit? Right now, I have 12 boxes of cereal and only opened one.

1g5rydl,https://i.redd.it/yiybj886sbvd1.jpeg,Introducing ToolNest.io: Your New All-in-One Digital Toolbox,"Hey there!

Over the past few months, I've been pouring my heart and soul into a project that started as a simple idea and grew into something I'm really proud of. Let me tell you the story of ToolNest.io.

It all began when I found myself constantly switching between different websites for various online tools. As a developer, I thought, ""There has to be a better way."" That's when the idea hit me - why not create a single platform that houses all these tools?

Fast forward through countless late nights, countless cups of coffee, and more than a few coding challenges, and ToolNest.io was born. It's a free, mobile-friendly platform that now hosts over 30 online tools.

The journey wasn't always smooth. I had to learn new technologies, overcome design hurdles, and figure out how to make everything work seamlessly on both desktop and mobile. But with each challenge, the platform grew stronger.

Today, ToolNest.io offers tools for:
- PDF manipulation
- File conversion
- Code formatting and validation
- Productivity
- Encoding/decoding

And the best part? It's all free, with no signup required.

Now, I want to be transparent with you all. To help cover the costs of running the site and potentially turn this into a sustainable project, I'm planning to implement AdSense on the website. Don't worry though - the core functionality will always remain free, and I'll do my best to ensure the ads are as unobtrusive as possible.

As a solo developer, seeing people use and benefit from something I've built is incredibly rewarding. I'm constantly adding new tools and improving existing ones based on user feedback.

So, if you're looking to simplify your online toolkit, give ToolNest.io a try. Your support means the world to me.

Check it out at www.toolnest.io and let me know what you think. Every visit, every piece of feedback helps this indie dev's dream grow a little bigger.

1g5ry6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1g5ry6c/aita_for_outing_my_classmate_as_bi/,AITA for outing my classmate as bi?,"Ok, so I, 21 year old college student had made friends with a girl in my class, Lexi, 20, (fake name) who sat next to me for a semester. We both had the same major and similar interests, like anime and drawing. One thing I noted about her appearance, is that she dressed alt, and everything she wore matched as looked well together. 

This had me taking note of what she was wearing, not in a creepy way, but rather watching how she styled things like chains and makeup. One thing I found humorous is that her limited color pallet in clothes meant her keycard matched her outfit, a puffy blue keychain and a snail sticker on her school id, one that had the bi flag colors, that hooked onto her keys. About a fourth of the size of the key card, all on a clear case.

Normally this is a small note, not anything I thought hard on, as I normally have her a once over when she sat down and we began talking about hw, or life etc. it really wasn’t a longer thought then “oh, she’s bi. Cool.”

However, one day me, her and two other guys who I don’t know well were carpooling to class and we were lightly talking about dating and all that. Again nothing serious, I think the guy sitting next to her started it, trying to gauge how single she was. I’m aroace, so I didn’t have much to say on your universities dating pool, but I, for some reason, made a comment that at least with her being bi, she has more options. 

Now we’ve never really talked about our preferences before, but I wasn’t expecting an uncomfortable silence. She gripped the steering wheel and her voice got very hard but quiet,  clearly disturbed and asked what I meant. 

I stuttered, admittedly caught off guard by the reaction, as I was slow in processing the uncomfortable air and the two guys seeming like they wanted to jump out the windows to avoid the toxic air in the car. I asked her if she wasn’t bi, and if I was mistaken, saying that I was thrown off by the bi flag snail. 

We parked and the guy upfront seemed to be comforting her, so she might’ve been distressed but I couldn’t see as I was sitting behind the drivers seat. The guys then snapped at me, saying I shouldn’t out someone to a group of strangers, and that it’s a very private matter. 

Now, I get that part, I didn’t come out for a long time, but I was under that impression that you don’t wear your pride flag until you are ready. It never occurred to me that she was still in the closet, if I had even an inkling, I wouldn’t have brought it up. We all attend an art school, we have many queer people in our class, but again, even with all that, if I thought she wasn’t ready to come out I would’ve kept my mouth shut. I guess she might’ve thought it was a subtle design that no one would notice?

She didn’t talk to me much after that, and after that class ended and I saw her on campus she would ignore my waving. People are saying I outed her, which I guess I did, but Aita? I’ve also apologized, because I felt really bad, but she doesn’t seem interested in my excuses. 


((edit: wow u guys work fast! Can’t say I didn’t see this coming, I personally thought I was the ahole, but my friend (who is know apologizing in my ear at me being roasted lol) thought I did nothing wrong. So we made a bet and posted it.

Small update: I sent a mutual friend a text two days ago asking if I could apologize to her in person, and she got back to me today to say that my friend already accepted my apology a while ago, she just wasn’t sure how to approach it. She had bought the sticker from a show that claimed it was subtle. She was caught off guard that someone not only noticed the sticker, but also knew it was the bi flag. 

I just hope this post helps people learn to keep their mouth shut, no good decisions are made on no coffee at 8am. Also that people who wear pride merch aren’t always out, and subtlety stickers aren’t a guarantee. 

((Also for the twice as many options comment, I had no idea that was offensive, I’ve heard bi friends say it, and I used it a lot when I went by that label, I had no idea that was offensive, so noted and underlined triple times fr. Never really processed that, especially since I stopped going by bi three months ago.)) thank you again for your honesty. My friend that told me I’m nta owes me coffee. ))",133,1729174687.0,AmItheAsshole,501,0.65,False
1g5rwjr,https://www.reddit.com/r/llctips/comments/1g5rwjr/how_i_dissolved_my_first_llc_after_a_first/,How I dissolved my first LLC after a first unsuccessful business,"Hey everyone, I wanted to share my experience from dissolving my first LLC—an online coffee subscription service I started a couple of years ago. 

Things didn’t go as planned, and I ended up having to close it down. It was tough, but I learned a lot during the process, and if you’re going through something similar, I hope this helps.

Here’s a quick breakdown of the steps I had to take when dissolving the LLC for my failed startup:

**1. Vote to Dissolve the LLC**  
First things first, you gotta get all members on board. In my case, we had a unanimous vote (thankfully). You’ll want to check your operating agreement because it usually outlines how voting works—majority vote, two-thirds, etc. Just make sure the voting process is clear and everyone agrees before you move forward.

**2. Notify Creditors**  
This is where things got real for us. After deciding to shut down, we had to notify creditors and settle any debts. Trust me, this part can get messy if you don’t handle it properly. In most states, creditors have a certain deadline to file claims, so get ahead of this to avoid surprises.

**3. File Final Tax Returns and Get Tax Clearance**  
Taxes—everyone’s favorite part, right? 😅 Seriously though, make sure all your taxes are filed before you can officially dissolve the LLC. In some states, you also need to get tax clearance, which can take a while. If you’re like me and didn’t have all your financials in order, get a tax pro to help out here. We also had to close business bank accounts and tie up any loose ends.

**4. File Articles of Dissolution**  
You can’t just walk away; you gotta officially file the Articles of Dissolution with the state. It’s basically the reverse of the Articles of Organization you filed when starting the LLC. The state laws differ, so be sure to check the specifics for where your LLC is registered.

**5. Distribute Assets**  
Now, dividing the assets (if there’s anything left) was tricky. For us, it wasn’t just about splitting up the remaining property or funds—we had to consider future plans and preferences of the members. It’s a good idea to be creative here, especially if members are planning to start new ventures with some of the assets.

**6. Close Accounts and Cancel Licenses**  
Finally, make sure you close all business accounts, cancel licenses, and shut down any permits. I almost forgot to cancel a few software subscriptions we weren’t using anymore. Get everything tied up so there are no loose ends later on.

I’m sharing all this because, as someone who’s been through it, I know it can feel overwhelming. But if you follow these steps and don’t skip anything, you’ll be in a much better spot to wrap things up legally and properly.

Any of you been through this? Would love to hear your experiences or tips if you have any to add.

Hope this helps!",1,1729174564.0,llctips,0,1.0,False
