We’re 30.

I’m trying to figure out if I’m being overly sensitive or if this would bother other people too.

The guy asked me out and we met at Starbucks. Right off the bat, he did this thing that already annoys me. He kept asking which Starbucks to go to, multiple times, even though we have been to the exact same one together before (in our childhood town - and it's a 5 minute walk from his parents' house!).

He got there ONE minute before me and told me he already ordered his coffee on the Starbucks app. So then I left where he was standing and went to stand in line to order. He then tried to sound gentlemanly and said, “Oh, I can order for you on the app!” I said it was fine as I was moving to stand in line. At that point, he didn’t wait with me or stand nearby. He just went and sat down at a table.

After I ordered, I joined him. A few minutes later, his drink was ready. He got up, went to the pickup counter, grabbed his coffee, and came back (took about 30 seconds). He didn’t even glance at the counter to see if mine was ready (it had my name on it), let alone try to grab it. As soon as he sat back down, I went up to grab my coffee.

I know this sounds small, but it rubbed me the wrong way. If roles were reversed, I would have waited for him before ordering (or actually ANYONE I'm meeting up with) and if he was late, I would've texted him to ask him what he wanted (and ordered for both of us). It wasn’t about buying me coffee. It was more about awareness and basic courtesy.

Is there an unspoken rule of waiting for your date to arrive (no matter how long you've known them for) before ordering?

I think he ordered his own coffee on the app so that he didn't have to pay for me.",1,1766930637.0,NoStupidQuestions,2,1.0,False

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

I’m not sure what I’m doing wrong.,"Based on every review I’ve ever read, I decided to get a Technivorm Moccamaster to replace my OXO brewer, which finally broke down. The OXO brewer made delicious coffee, and I liked that I could brew directly into a mug. 

I buy whole bean coffee and grind them fresh in a Niche burr grinder. I’ve had the Technivorm for about a week now, and for the life of me I can’t brew a good pot of coffee with it. The coffee I’ve been brewing tastes slightly hollow and not as rich and flavourful as the coffee I brewed with the OXO (using the same ratios). The best I’ve managed is “okay” coffee. I’m on the verge of selling it on Facebook marketplace and going back to the OXO. 

The only thing that keeps me from doing so is that I know it must be user error based on everyone else’s experience. I just don’t know wtf I’m doing wrong. I’ve tried adjusting the ratios. I’ve followed the suggested ratios that were in the manual, which resulted in an under extracted, slightly bitter coffee. I’m not sure what else to try. ",3,1766930564.0,BuyItForLife,2,1.0,False
1pxs2i9,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1pxs2i9/why_does_loving_a_parent_hurt_this_much/,Why Does Loving a Parent Hurt This Much?,"Have you ever loved someone with unconditional love, while their love was clearly conditional?

From the time I was a very young child until I was 19.
I’m 20 now.

Since I was a baby and didn’t understand anything, up until I was 19, I loved my father deeply. I didn’t care about what he did in the past, even though there were serious problems between him and my mother, including physical violence. I witnessed many situations that should have made me, as a child, pull away from him — but I didn’t. I kept loving him.

I truly saw him as the best person, despite everything.

I always tried to show him love and importance. I would tell him “anything you want” and “I’m here for you.” If he sent me messages about fathers, I would reply with loving words, trying to make him feel valued and loved. But none of it really mattered.

I did everything for him. I woke up early while everyone else was asleep, made his breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I cleaned, washed his clothes, ironed them.
Some people might say these are normal things — but they’re only “normal” when everyone does them. In our house, no one served my father except me.

I did all of this purely out of love. I never got money, never expected anything in return.

When he fought with my mother, I tried to calm things down, even though I knew deep down that he was wrong. I just didn’t want to believe it.

I kept loving him.

I was the only one who would sit with him, drink coffee with him. When he entered a room, everyone else would leave and go to their rooms — but I stayed.

The only times he showed me love were when I achieved something big at school. If I didn’t, he would get angry, yell, or completely ignore me.

Once, he was angry at my brother. I kissed his head, and he gave me a cold, judging look and went back to his phone.

I used to kiss his head and his hands.
Whenever guests came, I cleaned the entire guest area, washed the yard, burned incense, cleaned the bathrooms, and prepared coffee and tea — while my brothers were sleeping and didn’t help at all.

One memory that still hurts: when I was a child, I was crying in the car while he was angry. He yelled at me, dropped me off at home alone, and left. Everyone else was at work.

Another time, he was fighting with my mother. I stood in between them, and he threw a cup that broke on my face.

Once, my aunt insulted him in front of people. I defended him fiercely, cursed her, and told her not to talk about my father and that he was better than her. Deep down, I knew she was right — but I was lying to myself because I loved him.

I used to yell at my younger sisters if they didn’t obey him. They would ask me, “Why does he act like this?” and I would say, “He’s under pressure.”

But now, everything has changed.

My perspective and my behavior toward him completely changed. I noticed that I started hating his presence. I don’t want to sit with him anymore or drink coffee with him. I make two coffees — one for him and one for myself. When he enters a place, I leave it.

I’ve become distant, and he noticed. He started saying, “I’m your father,” meaning: Why are you treating me this way?

I swear I never did this on purpose.
It just happened.

I stopped obeying him.
I stopped doing things with love.
Everything I do now feels forced — just to keep the peace or stop him from calling my name.
I don’t even want to see him anymore.

Now I do things only out of duty, not love.",1,1766930555.0,family,1,1.0,False

Just got a Breville Barista Touch and I’m still waiting on fresh beans to deliver to my house (ordered from Trade Coffee).

The one thing I’m confused about is the timing. We currently have old beans for practicing (our shots are super sour right now so still trying to figure it out) and I’m confused when the timer for that 36g of coffee should start. It starts pulling around 8 seconds so is it 30 seconds from the 8? Making it a total of 38 seconds? Or is it 22 seconds from the 8 second start time that should pull the 36g of espresso?

1pxs0gu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hashimotos/comments/1pxs0gu/any_new_research_or_approaches_for_hashimotos/,Any new research or approaches for Hashimoto’s beyond “just take T4”? Sharing my experience & looking for insights,"Hi everyone,

I’ve been dealing with Hashimoto’s and, like many of you, I started with the standard endocrinology approach: diagnose, monitor TSH, prescribe T4, repeat forever.

Over time, I became frustrated because this model focuses almost exclusively on hormone replacement, while antibodies keep attacking the thyroid and the underlying immune dysregulation is largely ignored.

So I started digging deeper into the literature and listening to specialists outside the strictly “traditional” model (functional / immunology-focused). What I’ve learned so far:

* There is no real “cure” for Hashimoto’s, but remission *does* seem possible.
* Many potential triggers have been described: chronic infections (e.g. H. pylori, viral reactivations), gut permeability, SIBO, major stress, nutrient deficiencies, etc.
* Gluten (and possibly other foods like dairy or soy) may worsen autoimmunity in some people due to molecular mimicry and immune cross-reactivity.
* Micronutrients such as selenium, vitamin D, magnesium, zinc, vitamin E, etc. seem relevant not just for deficiency, but for *optimal* immune regulation.

Personally, by addressing diet, stress, and some of these factors, I managed to reduce my thyroid antibodies by more than 60%. Unfortunately, during a period of intense stress and anxiety, they later increased significantly again — which reinforced for me how complex and systemic this disease really is.

**Personally, this is the approach I plan to take:**

1. Instead of committing to a specific diet (keto, carnivore, anti-inflammatory, etc.), I will focus on **eliminating gluten, dairy, and other foods that are chemically similar to thyroid peroxidase (TPO)**, in order to reduce potential immune cross-reactivity.
2. I will take a much deeper look into **gut health**. Until now, I relied almost exclusively on zonulin to assess intestinal permeability, but I now understand that **zonulin is not the only marker and is not 100% reliable**. I plan to test for: I strongly suspect the gut may be a key factor for me, as I underwent **two** ***H. pylori*** **eradication treatments years ago**.
   * SIBO
   * *H. pylori*
   * Gut microbiota / dysbiosis
3. I will run **tests to detect active or chronic infections**, since several pathogens have been described as potential triggers for Hashimoto’s.
4. I will check **vitamin and micronutrient levels**, not only to identify deficiencies but to see whether they are in *optimal* ranges. In the past, I have supplemented with selenium, magnesium, vitamin D, vitamin K, and vitamin E.
5. I want to undergo **immunological testing** to better understand which immune cells are dysregulated and to screen for **other autoimmune conditions**, since having one increases the risk of developing others.
6. I plan to contact the **immunologist who diagnosed my** ***H. pylori*** **years ago**. I never had digestive symptoms; instead, I had widespread skin flare-ups. While most doctors prescribed antihistamines, he connected my symptoms to research linking that bacterium to immune and dermatological manifestations — a rare kind of doctor.
7. I will look for an **endocrinologist with a more functional, not purely traditional, approach**.
8. The hardest part for me: **reducing stress and anxiety**. My current ideas include:
   * Less coffee
   * More physical activity
   * More green juices
   * At least one or two relaxation massages per month

So my questions to the community are:

* Have there been any **recent studies or advances** (2023–2025) that you find promising for Hashimoto’s?
* Has anyone here worked with an endocrinologist + immunologist team?
* What approaches have helped you most in reducing antibodies or symptoms (even if not fully eliminating them)?
*  Is there anything else you have done or would recommend, that I may be overlooking?

I’m not anti-medication hormone replacement is clearly necessary for many of us, but I strongly feel that focusing *only* on T4 misses a big part of the picture.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

It changed my life.","Today marks exactly 365 days without caffeine. I wanted to share my experience in case it helps someone who's on the fence.

Background:

I'm a 44-year-old man from Paris. I had been drinking coffee for over 20 years – between 5 and 10 cups a day toward the end. I was so dependent that I would wake up exhausted, make a coffee, and drink it lying in bed just to be able to function. Then I'd have several more throughout the day.

Why I quit:

I always thought I was just ""an anxious person"" – intrusive thoughts, racing mind, constant mental noise. I thought that was my personality. I also thought my poor sleep was just my nature. I could fall asleep despite all the caffeine, but I never woke up rested. Ever. Sleeping 7-8 hours felt impossible.
I also remember being at work in the middle of the afternoon, so wired from caffeine that I couldn't focus. I'd be sitting at my computer, unable to work – not because I was tired, but because I was too stimulated. I had to stop and wait for it to pass.
I knew something was wrong, but I couldn't pinpoint it.

How I quit:

I got a bad flu right before Christmas last year and spent a week bedridden. I used that opportunity to quit cold turkey – the flu symptoms masked the caffeine withdrawal. I had tried to quit before and knew how brutal the first week could be, so this was my window.

After the flu, I still had:

Night sweats
Extreme fatigue
Brain fog

I didn't fight it. I took naps when I needed to (sneaking home at lunch when possible). I let my body recover.

The results (1 year later):

The difference is night and day:

Anxiety: Gone. The mental noise, the intrusive thoughts – all gone. My mind is quiet now. I finally feel like a normal person.
Sleep: I now sleep 7-8 hours and wake up actually rested. I can jump out of bed in the morning. This felt impossible before.
Steady energy: My energy is now evenly distributed throughout the day. No spikes, no crashes. Just a stable baseline from morning to evening.
Focus: This is huge. My ability to concentrate is unlike anything I've ever experienced in my life. I can do deep work for hours now. Before, caffeine was a blocker – I thought it helped me focus, but it was doing the opposite.
Exercise: Going to the gym or doing HIIT is effortless now. No issue with motivation or energy.
Alcohol cravings: I noticed that heavy coffee drinking made me crave alcohol in the evening to ""calm down"" from the stimulation. That's gone too.

For context:

I also quit smoking (2+ years ago) and alcohol (1 year ago). Caffeine was BY FAR the hardest to quit. Not even close.
Looking back, caffeine (along with my other addictions) was a major blocker to living a balanced, productive life. Removing it unlocked everything else.
My only ""slip-ups"" this year:
One slice of tiramisu (couldn't refuse)
A few Kit-Kats one evening
About 8-10 cups of tea throughout the year (accidentally bought tea instead of herbal infusion)
I'm not extreme about it – I won't refuse a chocolate dessert at a dinner party. But I stay away from coffee completely.

My advice:

If you recognize yourself in what I described – the anxiety, the racing thoughts, the unrefreshing sleep, the inability to focus despite being wired – just try it. Commit to one month. That's it. See how you feel.
It's a real game changer. Nothing magical happened, and yet the gap between who I was and who I am now is enormous. I feel normal. Baseline. Quiet.

I've been working on a side project - basically trying to build a better resource for people looking to find work in the coffee industry. Before I go too far down the rabbit hole, I wanted to ask people who've actually been through it:

**If you've found a barista job (especially in Europe or relocating internationally), what actually worked for you?**

* Coffee Jobs Board
* Perfect Daily Grind jobs section
* Sprudge Jobs
* Generic sites like Indeed filtered for barista roles

But I'm curious:

* Are there country-specific sites that are better for certain cities?
* Did you find your job through Instagram/word of mouth instead?
* Any roasters or cafés that have good career pages worth checking directly?

I saw a post here a while back from someone in Ireland looking to relocate within the EU and it got me thinking about how scattered all this info is.

But in many ""Colonial Style"" companies, there is a massive, invisible department that uses up 40% of everyone’s energy. It doesn't have a name. It doesn't have a budget. But everyone works there.

It is: **The Department of Managing the Boss's Mood.**

**The Scenario:** You have a ""Strong"" (Rude) Leader. Before a meeting, the team gathers in the hallway. They are not discussing the *client*. They are not discussing the *strategy*. They are whispering: *""What mood is he in today?""* *""Don't mention the sales numbers yet, wait until he's had his coffee.""* *""If he starts yelling, just look down and agree.""*

**The Earth-Shattering Waste:** Think about the intellect in that hallway. Engineers. MBAs. Data Scientists. Some of the smartest minds in the country. And they are currently using their massive brainpower... **to navigate one person's ego.**

They are not solving the market. They are solving the *Boss*.

**The ""Ego Tax"":** If your team spends 3 hours preparing for a 1-hour meeting, not because the *work* is complex, but because they are terrified of your *reaction,* that is a tax.

* Your competitors are using that energy to build better products.
* You are using that energy to ""manage up.""

**The Insight:** A ""Difficult Boss"" thinks their anger makes people work harder. The truth? It makes people work *wronger.* Instead of ""Customer-Centric,"" the company becomes **""Boss-Centric.""** The entire organization pivots to protect the fragility of one leader, leaving the customer completely forgotten.

**The Shift:** Real professional maturity is **Predictability.** Your team should never have to ""guess"" your weather. They should be able to walk into your office with bad news, good news, or no news, and know exactly who they will meet: **A calm, rational adult focused on the problem.**

NKD Knives:

-Nigara AS Migaki Tsuchime 180mm Kiritsuke Nakiri

(Christmas present for my wife who is also a big fan of K-tips) 

Initial impression are that she is a big fan of the cladding line and ebony handle. The cutting performance seems pretty good out of  the box. Threw it into instant coffee right after these photos were taken to try to get a patina going. Can post an update photo in the comments if anyone is interested in how it turned out. 

-Nigara SG2 Anmon Damascus Petty 150mm

A little early New Years present for ourselves. First japanese petty knife, and first powdered steel. We are instantly and fan of using it over the wusthof pairing/utility (that are now our beater knives lol). This one is also going on my wife's magnet. 

-Yoshimi Kato Damascus Kuro Ko-Bunka 135mm 

This little guy is the tall ""petty"" knife I've been looking for ever since I was hooked on taller knives from daily driving the Matsubara bunka and gyuto. It was a surprise gift from my wife yesterday.  Fit and finish on this one is awesome and it feels quite sharp out of the box. 

SOTC: from left to right

- Kusackichi White #1 Yo-Deba (double bevel) 120mm
 (this one is the chicken and fish destroyer that I picked up from a local store to me, and it gets used nearly every day).
- Yoshimi Kato SG2 Ko-Bunka 135mm
- Nigara SG2 Anmon Petty 150mm
- Nigara  Aogami Super Kiritsuke Nakiri 180mm
- Matsubara Blue #2 Wavy Face Bunka 180mm
- Matsubara Blue #2 Nashiji Gyuto 210mm

I'm almost positive I'll be making another update once the other two arrive from Carbon Knife Co. Might be done collecting more for a bit after those show up unless I run into a wide bevel Kagekiyo or a Takada Hanabi down the line.

The room is designed to discourage memory.

No windows. No clocks. Walls painted a shade of beige that suggests neutrality while quietly enforcing amnesia. The lights are neither bright nor dim, but permanently *adequate*. People who work here develop an instinctive sense of time based on caffeine decay and the stiffness of their joints.

Three analysts sit around a table that has never been polished.

They are not field operatives. They are not strategists.   They are **interpreters of residue**—the frogs who explain what happened after all the interesting parts are over.

A file appears on the screen.

Not a thick one.

Thin files are more dangerous.

“Alright,” says Mac, scrolling. “We’ve got a theft, a build, a deployment, and an academic phone call that shouldn’t exist.”

“Define ‘shouldn’t,’” says Jones.

“Doesn’t align with incentives,” Analyst Mac replies. “Snow Leopard had clean extraction. No pressure. No need for consultation.”

Norman sips cold coffee.

“Except curiosity,” he says.

They pull up the call metadata.

One call.

One duration.

No obfuscation.

“No alias,” Jones notes. “Amateur move.”

“No,” Norman says. “Young move.”

They switch screens.

**FEATHERSTONE, A.**

No prior flags. No contracts. No funding anomalies. A career so clean it borders on suspicious.

“What did he say?” Mac asks.

Norman reads the transcript summary.

“He asked one question,” he says.

“What question?”

“‘Who is asking you to hurry?’”

The room goes quiet.

That happens sometimes. Not often. Silence here is usually procedural, not thoughtful. This one lingers.

“And then?” Jones asks.

“He declined involvement,” Norman says. “No warnings. No follow-up. No reporting.”

“So he did nothing,” Jones concludes.

Mac shakes his head slowly.

“No,” he says. “He did *something*.”

He pulls up a timeline.

Snow Leopard’s activity slows after the call. Not stops. Slows. Hesitations appear. Double-checks. Secondary consultations. The first deviation from flawless execution.

“He decelerated a professional,” Mac says.

Jones frowns.

“That’s… not nothing.”

“It’s worse,” Norman says. “It’s influence without leverage.”

They consider this.

Influence is supposed to leave marks—payments, threats, ideology. Featherstone leaves none. He does not recruit. He does not report. He does not resist overtly.

He simply introduces friction.

“What do we do with him?” Jones asks.

Mac leans back.

“We don’t,” he says.

Norman nods.

“Incentivizing him would accelerate him,” he says. “Pressure would create alignment.”

“And alignment creates predictability,” Jones adds.

They look at the screen again.

A life defined by refusals.

A man who slows systems by asking questions that do not demand answers.

Mac types.

> **RECOMMENDATION:** Observe. Do not incentivize.

He hits save.

Elsewhere, Professor Featherstone finishes his lecture five minutes early. He erases the board carefully, as if the chalk might be reused. Students pack their bags, already thinking about lunch.

As they leave, one asks, “Professor, why don’t you ever patent your work?”

Featherstone considers the question.

“Patents,” he says, “are for things that want to be found.”

The student nods, not understanding, which is fine. Understanding is not always required for compliance.

1pxrqrj,https://i.redd.it/2k5yg9tz8y9g1.jpeg,2025 IN FIELD NOTES (AND STICKERS) - PLUS SOME REFLECTION.,"
I began journaling on 21st May 2025, opening my first notebook after a lifetime of not really writing anything since I was in school (20+ years ago). I was late to the party, six months in, but I arrived with intent. What started as a practical experiment quickly became a daily ritual, and before I knew it I had reached this point: 22 notebooks filled. Each one following a similar structure—a food diary and to-do list every day, followed by three or four pages of journaling. The last two pages of every notebook are always reserved for what I call my “Field Quotes,” a small but meaningful archive of words that inspire, steady, or challenge me. Some of you will have seen my dedicated Field Quotes books, which are the culmination of those final two pages from each completed notebook.

I originally started journaling to support my weight-loss journey, and it worked in ways I didn’t expect. I’ve lost over 60 pounds, but just as importantly, journaling helped take weight off my mind as well. Writing has given structure to my days and clarity to my thoughts, turning reflection into action and momentum. Along the way, I discovered a passion for reading, stationery, and it also re-ignited my passion for design. Thanks to the power of the interwebs, I also found the Field Nuts community and the people within it, which became an unexpected, but wholly appreciated gift. Through shared interests and shared enthusiasm, I’ve formed international friendships that make what is essentially a solitary habit feel communal. What began as a simple tool has become a practice that is reshaping my health, my thinking, and my connection to others. It’s changing my life.

Pictured bottom right are my Field Quotes books, my weight tracker (using a 56-week planner from the Resolution set), and a Dime Novel, which I use to record the books I’ve read.

For those of you who celebrate it, I hope you have had a very merry Christmas. If you do not celebrate Christmas, then I hope you have enjoyed the holidays. I wish every single one of you, health, wealth, and prosperity for 2026.",7,1766929642.0,FieldNuts,0,1.0,False

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

**hdfidelity presents**   

### **Continuing Adventures of Mouse Capone...**
# **A Bird for All Seasons**  

### **CHAPTER VI — NORMALIZATION**

The interview airs at 2:30 p.m., which is not an accident.

Adjacency without prime time scrutiny. Early enough to imply seriousness, late enough to avoid insomniacs and obsessives—the demographic most likely to notice wording.

**Monkey Tycoon** sits beneath studio lights calibrated to remove shadows without removing character. He is young enough to still look like a son and old enough to sound like a decision. His tie is conservative. His smile is rehearsed but not dishonest. This is important: credibility is built faster when it is not entirely fabricated.

The host leans forward.

“So,” she says, “big news today. You’re moving the company headquarters from Dayton to New York.”

Monkey Tycoon nods.

“We are,” he says, with the calm confidence of someone explaining gravity. “It’s about proximity. Speed. Access.”

The words are smooth. Familiar. They do not raise alarms because they have been used to justify everything from railroads to reorgs.

“In today’s environment,” he continues, “you can’t afford latency. Markets don’t wait. Innovation doesn’t wait. If you hesitate, you’re not being careful—you’re being irrelevant.”

Cut to:

A patent office hallway at 2:13 a.m.

Fluorescent lights buzz with the low-grade menace of a migraine. Clerks in rolled-up sleeves move stacks of paper from one cart to another. The work is not secret. It is simply *urgent*, which is how institutions hide their priorities in plain sight.

A supervisor checks a watch.

“Push this through,” she says. “We’ll backfill the review later.”

A stamp comes down.

APPROVED (PENDING).

Cut back to the studio.

Monkey Tycoon smiles sympathetically.

“This isn’t about abandoning our roots,” he says. “It’s about recognizing where the future already is.”

The host nods. The audience murmurs approval. Futures are comforting when they sound inevitable.

Cut to:

A windowless room where a small team reviews weapons documentation. They do not discuss function. Function is settled. They discuss phrasing.

“Remove ‘prototype,’” one analyst says. “Implied instability.”

“Change ‘deployment’ to ‘evaluation,’” another adds. “Softer.”

Someone deletes a paragraph describing authorship.

No one objects.

Cut back to Monkey Tycoon.

“We owe it to our shareholders,” he says, “to move at the speed of opportunity.”

Speed.

Cut to a clerk yawning as she feeds another document into a scanner.

Access.

Cut to a red pen crossing out a name.

Inevitability.

The interview wraps with applause. Monkey Tycoon thanks the host, shakes hands, exits stage left. By the time the credits roll, the decision has already been reframed as *maturity*. Growth. Evolution. The natural order of things.

No one mentions risk.

Risk has been absorbed.

In the patent office, dawn approaches. The clerks finish their coffee and stack the last of the files. They do not know what they have processed, only that it mattered enough to justify overtime.

In the documentation room, the final version is uploaded. Clean. Neutral. Authorless. A system described as if it had always existed.

Elsewhere, analysts update spreadsheets. Boxes are checked. Timelines align.

The world does not change abruptly.

It *settles*.

And somewhere between a studio applause break and a rubber stamp, something dangerous becomes normal—not because it is celebrated, but because it is no longer questioned.

Progress, after all, rarely announces itself as a risk.

It announces itself as a schedule.

1pxrpc6,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductivityApps/comments/1pxrpc6/i_spent_8_months_optimizing_my_desk_setup_the/,I spent 8 months optimizing my desk setup. The problem was I was wearing pajamas.,"For eight long months, I was in denial, blaming everything under the sun for my unproductive work sessions. The chair, the Pomodoro timer, my coffee intake (or lack thereof), even my note-taking app of choice – all were scapegoats.

I bought a standing desk, experimented with binaural beats, and installed website blockers, yet my deep work sessions remained stubbornly mediocre. I was lucky to get two hours of focused work before my brain turned to mush.

Then, by accident, I stumbled upon a solution. One Tuesday, I had a 9 AM client call. In a panic, I showered, threw on real clothes, and sat down at my desk at 8:50 AM to prepare. After the call ended at 9:30, I just kept working. By 10 AM, I was in a flow state, and I stayed locked in until noon.

When I checked my time-tracking app later, I'd logged 4.5 hours of deep work – a stark contrast to my usual Tuesday, where I'd be lucky to get two hours spread throughout the entire day.

The only thing that had changed was my attire. Instead of my usual hoodie, I was wearing actual clothes. I initially dismissed it as a fluke, so I decided to test it for two weeks.

**Week 1:** Rolled out of bed, straight to my desk, pajamas and hoodie all day.  
**Week 2:** Followed my full morning routine: shower, brush teeth, and change into ""going out"" clothes before sitting down.

The results were embarrassingly clear.

**Pajama mode:** Averaged 2.1 hours of deep work per day, with frequent Slack checks, research, and aimless scrolling.

**Outside clothes mode:** Averaged 4.3 hours of deep work per day, with flow states kicking in faster and lasting longer.

I later researched this phenomenon and discovered ""enclothed cognition,"" the idea that our brains associate certain clothes with specific mental states. Pajamas signal relaxation, while real clothes signal work.

I had been trying to run high-performance deep work on low-performance hardware – my sleepwear.

What infuriates me is that I wasted months optimizing my task manager and desk setup when the solution was as simple as putting on pants.

Now, my work-from-home protocol is non-negotiable:

Wake up.  
Shower and brush teeth, even if I showered the night before.  
Change into ""outside"" clothes (doesn't have to be fancy, just not sleepwear).  
Then, sit down at my desk.

It sounds ridiculously simple, but it's the single most impactful productivity change I've made in two years of remote work.

Once I started treating getting dressed as a state trigger, I realized I had no framework for what to wear for different work modes: deep work days, client calls, casual Fridays where I still needed to look presentable on Zoom.

After getting a few DMs on a previous post asking ""okay but what does casual actually look like?"", I threw together a simple guide in Notion – just examples by context (deep work, client calls, etc.) [HERE](https://mypersonalvault.notion.site/Everything-I-learned-about-dressing-for-high-stakes-publish-2d7498213e9880c189b5ecb0a2483aae?source=copy_link)

It's just a reference catalogue. Use what helps, ignore the rest.

Anyone else discovered their ""hardware toggle"" for focus?

### **Continuing Adventures of Mouse Capone...**
# **A Bird for All Seasons**  

### **CHAPTER IV — THEFT AS CHOREOGRAPHY**

Snow Leopard believes—incorrectly, but with confidence—that the hardest part of theft is entry.

This belief persists because entry is visible. Doors, windows, alarms, guards with opinions about posture. Entry has the decency to announce itself as a problem.

The truth is less theatrical.

The hardest part of theft is *leaving things exactly as they were*, minus one detail nobody thinks to look for.

The first location is a municipal archive disguised as a civic apology. Concrete, glass, a lobby that smells faintly of toner and resignation. Snow Leopard arrives mid-morning, wearing the uniform of a man whose purpose is to be ignored: clipboard, badge, the practiced slouch of someone paid too little to care too much.

The lever-action file sleeps inside a climate-controlled drawer, catalogued under a number that once mattered to someone who retired early or died quietly.

Snow Leopard does not rush.

He times his breathing to the rhythm of the building’s HVAC system. Inhale as the vents sigh. Exhale as the lights flicker imperceptibly. The drawer opens. The file is scanned, copied, replaced.

No alarms.

No footsteps.

No narrative.

He leaves with a mild disappointment, like finishing a crossword puzzle on the subway.

The second theft occurs two days later in a private R&D facility that has spent a great deal of money convincing itself it is impenetrable. Snow Leopard arrives after hours, this time as absence rather than presence. He moves where cameras are blind not because they are poorly placed, but because they assume intent.

The spring-load mechanism rests in a server isolated from the network, guarded by the belief that isolation equals security. Snow Leopard disabuses it of this notion gently, like correcting a child’s math homework.

He copies the data.

He restores the checksum.

He leaves a coffee cup exactly where it was, still warm.

The third theft is the most interesting only because it tries so hard not to be.

A patent attorney’s private archive. Legal security. Paper redundancies. Locked cabinets whose real defense is boredom. Snow Leopard navigates it with professional courtesy, extracting the slide-action schematics while the building dreams of billable hours.

Three thefts.

Three separate days.

Three methods.

Nothing links them except Snow Leopard, and Snow Leopard is very good at not being linkable.

Back in his temporary apartment—a forgettable rectangle with walls the color of noncommittal eggshell—he lays out the copied files.

Not physically.

That would be synthesis.

He reviews them sequentially. Independently. As instructed.

He notes the tolerances. Generous. Forgiving. A design that expects the world to be hostile and compensates by refusing to care.

Energy curves. Release timing. The elegance of stored violence that waits for permission.

Linear aggression. Forward motion that does not negotiate.

Snow Leopard closes the files.

Job done.

Except.

There is a sensation he cannot quite shake. A faint dissonance. Like hearing three different songs through three different walls and realizing they share a tempo.

He opens the first file again.

Then the second.

Then the information on the third.

He does not overlay them.

He does not assemble them.

He does not synthesize.

He merely… notices.

The forgiveness.

The restraint.

The inevitability.

Different philosophies.

Same rhythm.

The tolerances are wrong.

Not individually. Individually they are exquisite.

Collectively, they harmonize.

Snow Leopard feels a tightening behind his eyes. Curiosity, he knows, is inefficient. Curiosity leads to questions. Questions lead to context. Context leads to consequences.

He tells himself he is only checking for errors.

He checks again.

And again.

The dimensions align in ways they should not unless someone intended them to.

The timing curves echo one another, offset but compatible. The stress points resolve into complementary absences. Where one mechanism weakens, another compensates—not directly, but *implicitly*.

Snow Leopard leans back in his chair.

“No,” he murmurs to the empty room.

This is not incremental.

Incremental is additive. Improvement stacked atop improvement until something collapses under its own cleverness.

This is emergent.

A thing that does not exist in any one design, but appears the moment you stop pretending they are unrelated.

Snow Leopard closes his eyes.

In his mind—not on paper, not in software, not anywhere traceable—he allows the parts to move.

Fire.

It *initiates*.

The propulsion of the spring.

It *times*.

Resolve.

It *resolves*.

Together, they form a system that does not merely function, but *behaves*.

Reliable. Efficient. Decisive.

Unfair.

Snow Leopard’s pulse quickens, not with fear but with admiration. This is not a weapon assembled to win a fight.

This is a weapon designed to end asymmetric arguments.

He stands abruptly, pacing the room.

“No curiosity,” he reminds himself aloud.

But curiosity has already happened. It has already crossed the threshold, kicked off its shoes, and started rearranging the furniture.

Someone designed this knowing it would be stolen separately.

Someone designed this assuming a mind would notice the rhythm.

Snow Leopard stops.

There is a name forming at the edge of his thoughts. Not a person yet. A *type*. An intelligence that prefers structure over secrecy. An academic arrogance. A belief that truth will reveal itself if arranged properly.

An owl, perhaps.

Snow Leopard exhales slowly.

This job was supposed to be clean.

Flawless.

Which is precisely the problem.

Flawlessness draws attention. Not immediately. Not loudly. But inevitably.

He looks at the symbol on Madame Gazelle’s card, still etched into his memory.

“No assembly. No synthesis. No curiosity.”

He smiles, thin and exhilarated.

Too late.

The act itself was perfect.

And perfection, Snow Leopard is beginning to understand, is never neutral.

It is a signal.

And somewhere—already, inevitably—someone is learning how to read it.

# LLManwich Shops

**SouthEast Bend News** \- A new trend that’s catching on are coffee and sandwich shops where each menu item is a surprise tailored to the tastes of each customer. The menu at the LLManwich Shop here in SouthEast Bend seems absurdly simple, with entries like “sub sandwich” or “burger, side and a drink”, but tweens and teens are loving it. 

How this is made to work is by a technique called “AI scraping” where the patron allows a chatbot access to their social media, emails, and even their employment and health records. From there it not only determines what your likes and dislikes are, but even what your mood is, anticipating what type of meal you want, as well as the size, while targeting a comfortable dollar range for you.

Arty Tobor, between taking hearty bites of his cuddle fish, peanut butter and olive sandwich, gave SEBN the low-down on the experience. “I never really knew I’d like this combo, but somehow the bot just knows stuff. Every time I come here, it’s a surprise. Last week I got barbecue, blue cheese and pesto. Who would have known that by going through my emails with my dying sister that it could have determined this? And the pork barbecue was low fat and low salt, taking my blood pressure issues into account.”

When asked if he had any privacy concerns Tobor replied, “Oh there’s a 247 page privacy agreement. I mean, I only skimmed it, but from what the corporate website said, it’s all kept in a local database right here at the sandwich shop and I can opt out any time.”

Connie Startfisk, the shop owner explained the popularity of it this way. AI doesn’t really have a sense of taste or smell, and has no reference point for the experience of eating. This leaves it unfettered to make decisions free of any personal taste or bias. So when someone comes in, they know they are going to get something uniquely tailored to them each time, like that sweet potato, pimento ranch wrap I had for breakfast. 

When asked if she thought this was a passing fad, or here to stay she replied, “It’s such a liberating experience to let it just make arbitrary choices for you. I think letting AI take the driver’s seat and making all the decisions is the wave of the future.”",1,1766928815.0,antiai,0,0.67,False

Literally, she thinks I’m “addicted” and “have it every day”, because I’ve been drinking more of it over break.

I can’t even pick what day to get it anymore. She said I have to pick a specific day and get it that day every week, and that I can’t have it on day for things like finals (or my 3 consecutive days of morning AP exams).

I’m trying to quit a different bad habit that she doesn't even know about, right now. Being forced to quit a second habit that’s not nearly as bad for my health, simultaneously is going to make that much more difficult.

All because I wanted a cup of coffee before my 9-5 shift.

Almost makes me want to quit my job and do poorly in school, but not drink coffee. Show her what an actual problem looks like.

I’m on my period, my great grandma is in the hospital (maybe dying??).

Hey everyone  
  
  
One of my New Year's resolutions this year is to cut down on doomscrolling. I've been spending way too much time mindlessly scrolling through social media, watching short reels, and consuming content that doesn't really add value to my life.  
  
  
I wanted to replace that habit with something better, content that actually feeds my mind and helps me grow. So I built a simple web app called that curates 5 pieces of media every day: videos, music, articles, and newsletters. The idea is to have quality over quantity, just 5 things that are actually worth your time.  
  
  
It's available as a web app, right now it's just a demo  
  
I'd love to know what you think:  
\- Do you struggle of doomscrolling in general?  
\- Would you use something like this to read an article with your morning coffee?  
  
  
  
If this is something you can actually see yourself using, please sign up on the waitlist so I can get an estimate of interest before building it out fully.

Oh, the humanity!","Hey Reddit fam! So, I finally took the plunge and opened 'The Daily Grind' – my dream coffee shop. Picture this: cozy vibes, artisanal blends, the works. My initial thought for marketing? ""I'll just post cool latte art on Instagram, and BOOM, customers will flood in!"" Yeah, my past self was adorable and incredibly naive.

For the first few months, it was pure chaos. I was trying to run the shop, perfect my pour-overs, *and* be a social media guru, an SEO wizard, and an email marketing maestro. My nights were spent staring at analytics dashboards that looked like alien hieroglyphics. I’d try to set up a Facebook ad, get lost in a labyrinth of targeting options, and end up just boosting a post with five bucks, hoping for the best. The only thing that flooded in was my anxiety.

I remember one particularly late night, the smell of stale coffee lingering, looking at zero engagement on a post I’d spent an hour crafting, and just wanting to scream into my cold espresso. It felt like I was shouting into a void, putting in endless effort with absolutely no return. My dream was slowly being overshadowed by a constant, nagging feeling of digital inadequacy.

Then, a turning point. I read a few threads here (bless you, r/smallbusiness!) and realized I wasn't alone in this struggle. I started small: focusing on local Google My Business listings, actually *talking* to my customers and asking for reviews, and learning the absolute basics of content that genuinely connected. It's not magic, but slowly, I'm seeing real people walk in, mentioning they saw us online.

It’s still a mountain to climb, and I'm far from an expert, but I no longer feel like I'm drowning. The lesson? Digital marketing isn't just 'posting' – it's a whole ecosystem of strategy, connection, and constant learning. It’s hard work, but when a new face walks in because they saw your little shop online, it feels pretty darn good.

I've been trying to build a profitable one-person business for almost 4 years now. First three attempts completely failed, lost about $9K total between them and wasted probably 18 months of nights and weekends. Fourth attempt is working though, been running it for 16 months and currently making $6.8K monthly as the only person. First attempt was a task management app I built because I personally wanted it. Spent 5 months coding, launched it, got maybe 30 users total, zero revenue. Second was a Chrome extension for managing tabs, similar story. Third was a freelance marketplace specifically for designers, spent $3K on development, could never get enough supply or demand to make it work. Pattern was always the same, I built what I thought was cool without checking if anyone actually had that problem.

Fourth attempt started completely differently. I'm a content marketer at a SaaS company and kept hearing our sales team complain about tracking conversations across email, Slack, and LinkedIn. They'd lose context about prospects, forget what was discussed, waste time searching old messages. I asked 8 sales people at different companies if they had the same issue over coffee chats, 6 said yes and described almost identical problems. One was paying $80/month per person for a CRM they barely used just to track conversations.

Built the simplest possible version in 3 weeks, just a Chrome extension that captures conversations from different tools and organizes them by contact. Showed it to those 6 people, 3 started using it immediately. Asked if they'd pay $25/month, two said yes, one said maybe $20. Set up Stripe, got my first $45 MRR in week 4. That felt more real than anything from my previous three products. Growth was slow but steady. Posted in sales communities on Reddit and LinkedIn just helping people with conversation tracking problems, mentioned my tool when relevant. Hit $800/month by month 4, $1.9K by month 8. Started writing blog posts about sales productivity in month 6, took until month 10 before those started bringing organic signups. Now at month 16 making $6.8K with 289 paying users, working maybe 10-12 hours per week on support and small updates.

The shift wasn't learning better technical skills, it was building something people were already complaining about instead of what I thought they might need. Found that insight reading successful solopreneur stories in [FounderToolkit](http://foundertoolkit.org) where everyone said the same thing, solve real problems you discover through conversations not shower thoughts.

I’m about to install the Shades of Coffee Brew Pressure Gauge Kit on my Gaggia Classic (2009 model), but the inside of my machine is already very heavily modded and quite crowded (PID, SSRs, extra wiring, tubing, etc. see photos).

According to the official instructions, the normal method is to remove the 3-way solenoid and sandwich the brass adapter between the group and the solenoid, while leaving the boiler in place. However, with the current state of my machine and the limited space, I’m worried that this might be extremely difficult or even impossible to do cleanly that way.

Has anyone here installed this kit on a Classic before?

Any tips on the best approach?

I ended a 3 year long situationship in early 2025 as I figured it wasn’t getting anywhere. Always been very open with her (24F), always told her that eventually I’d want it to be a real relationship, she said it was fine by her, just not right now. 3 years down the road, still no sign of her wanting to make it anywhere close to a relationship. It was making me sad, especially since she introduced me to her whole family, and talked a lot about what she’d like to do later in life but somehow never included me in any of her plans.
For the first couple of years I did my best to communicate and tell her everything, but it didn’t work out.
That whole situation really drained a lot out of me. Eventually I stopped believing in having any chance of a future with her, or with anyone tbh.



So yeah, I’ve pretty much spent the last year on my own, thinking I was better by myself.
Here’s the catch tho : I met a girl (21F) in late november at a friend’s birthday party. Let’s call her A. We talked a lot and yeah, I was attracted to her. At one time during the evening, while she went to the bathroom, my friends who were also there all told me ""Dude she’s obviously into you"" and started teasing me.
I didn’t try anything, she did ask for my Instagram tho. While driving home I started overthinking a bit and figured I’d send her a message on Instagram and just tell her I’m really into her and would love to get some coffee or drinks another day.
More overthinking and I remembered she told me where she was working, and exactly when her shift would end and start the next day. So I went there, thought it’d be a bit cringy but somewhat romantic. Needless to say it was just cringy lol.
She told me she really liked me too, but that she was ""emotionally unavailable"", and that was fair enough, me too. She suggested we go to a concert with our other mutual friends sometime and I agreed.

Fast forward a couple of weeks and we meet at said concert. Afterwards we went to a party with the other musicians (my friends and I are studying music) and A tagged along. 
She teased me a bit for being somewhat forward with her, she was pretty touchy, always squeezing my arms (I’m a muscular guy), having a hand on my leg, sitting right next to me, even sat on my lap for a while. She even made a big lipstick mark on my cheek. 
However, another man asked for her number and she did give it to him.
I walked her home, we talked a lot and she suggested we meet again -alone- later that week. Had a pretty long and big hug on her doorstep (which is uncommon with people you’re not romantically involved with in my country) and I left.

So we did meet a couple days later (basically last week btw) grabbed a couple of drinks at bar downtown. The more she talked, the more I liked her. We eventually went to her place, and just sat in her living room listening to music and talking. 
She told me she was meeting that other guy she gave her number to the next day. Didn’t think much of it, she doesn’t owe me anything, we’re not even in a relationship or anything.
Didn’t kiss, I left at 3 am, she hugged me again, told me she’d like to see me again really soon. Agreed and went my way.
We met again the next day, went climbing, she liked it a lot. Thought I’d head home afterwards as she was hanging out with her best friend in the evening but she told me she wanted me to be there ""I told her about you"", so I did. We mostly talked, drank wine. I didn’t stay very long as I had to take care of my dog.

A friend had plans for a party this week end, and she told us we could bring a date so I asked A if she wanted to be mine, she said yes.
So we went to the party that week end, had lots of fun. At one point during the evening, I got a call from an unknown number, went on the balcony to answer it : it was an old friend’s mom, she told me her son died in a car crash and told me everything about the burial and all.
Needless to say I was pretty shocked, I’m used to grief, lots of people I know died, but it still had an effect on me and A noticed it. We stayed at the party a bit longer and eventually headed back to her place. She hugged (or cuddled I guess ?) me for so long I thought we’d fall asleep there, on her couch. I think I cried a bit. She told me she understood what I was going through. Told me I wasn’t going to lose everyone in my life. That she’ll always be here. 
She asked me to sleep at her place that night but I didn’t think I’d be able to sleep so I didn’t. We kissed, very quickly as I was leaving. Went back to my place sometime around 6 am. She sent me lots of texts, just asking how I was doing, that kind of stuff. That’s the last time we saw eachother.

I went to my friend’s burial, and we both left to go to our parents places for christmas a couple of days later.
Life went back to normal, we exchanged memes on Instagram, a few texts here and there. During the whole 24th/25th/26th of december period we didn’t text as much, both busy, but we did like each other’s stories on Instagram.
Yesterday I sent her a text, saying I was thinking of her, hoped she had a nice christmas and was looking forward to seeing her again. She left me on read. I don’t know if I’m overthinking it. 

I’m just wondering what some completely unrelated people would think of all that, hence why I am writing this.
What do you think ?
Did I do anything wrong ? 
I didn’t plan on liking her that much, clearly she neither so maybe that’s scaring her ?
I don’t believe in the one true and only love but man, ghosting me now seems a bit weird and it just confuses me.
I’m not planning on doing anything about it. Just thought I’d let things be and go with the flow. 
It’s just confusing to me considering everything she told me.
Maybe I’m just bad at understanding people. Maybe that’s also why my last situationship ended the way it did.
I was fine by myself, really bums me to be in a such a situation now.

Example from this week: acute tele transplant unit, short staffed. Four nurses total, including the charge nurse. Six patients each. Already bad. Now add this.

One nurse had two Rapid Responses happening at the same time. Not one after the other. Simultaneous. Four of us were all running back and forth between the rooms trying to keep two humans alive with duct tape, teamwork.

Then comes 04:30. Tacrolimus trough level time. If you know, you know. That sacred blood draw that must happen before the dose or the transplant gods will smite you.

So now we are sprinting between two rapids, coordinating labs, trying to not miss the tacro window, alarms going off, phones ringing, Epic freezing, the usual pre dawn chaos. And as everyone who has ever worked nights knows, time between 5 and 7 a.m. does not exist in a linear fashion. One second it is 05:12 and the next the day shift is standing there at 06:40 asking for report with fresh coffee and hope in their eyes.

Fast forward. I get a text later from the day shift nurse who received one of those patients. Complaining that the blood cultures were not drawn.
Spoiler alert: the blood culture order was placed at 06:40.
But sure. Night shift negligence.

However, the comment that really sent me was:
“Can you believe the night nurse didn’t do the skin assessment?” (the patient was a new admition at 0300)

Yes. I can believe it.

I vividly imagine us mid of two rapid responses, and the nurse yelling:
“STOP EVERYTHING. I NEED TO TAKE A PICTURE OF THIS PATIENT’S ASS.”

Because at my hospital, we are required to photograph the sacrum. Even if it is intact. Even if the patient is actively circling the drain.

This nurse is a very nice friend of mine. Truly kind. Also complains about absolutely everything on the unit. Every shift. Every detail. Every perceived failure of night shift.

And then there is the other type.

Another very nice person. Also not great as a nurse. She wants every microscopic detail during handoff. Asks about everything. Wants everything perfect. Gets visibly irritated if you cannot immediately recall a potassium from 24 hours ago or whether the patient last scratched their left ear or right ear.

But when she gives report?
Oh no, it is a mediocre one. Many tasks are pending. Important things somehow became “day shift can do it.” Orders are untouched. And the report itself is vague, rushed, and missing the same details she demands from everyone else.

I love my coworkers. I really do.
But sometimes I wonder how we are all licensed at the same time.

Night shift out here running rapids, drawing tacro troughs, bending time itself, and somehow still getting criticized because we did not stop a medical emergency to photograph an intact sacrum. ",47,1766927654.0,nursing,3,0.98,False

Same department but we don't interact with that team workwise so it wouldn't be a case of mixing business with pleasure before anyone asks.

She started in the company the last 6 months,. I've been here 6 years. I came across her organically and worked up the nerve to talk to her about 5 months ago when she happened to be sitting near me at lunch one time. And she was surprisingly receptive. Since then I make the effort to meet her at least once a week, we have coffee breaks which end up going on for 2 hours, long after she should be leaving the office to go home (even when I check with her if she needs to get going for her 80min drive back, she chooses to stay. She assures me if she wanted to leave, she'd he gone).

She's very sweet, we like enough of the same hobbies and I could listen to her talk all day. She has told me some personal stuff about her too, not darkest secrets or anything but still the kind you wouldn't go telling everyone, which suggests she finds some comfort in talking with me.

So that makes everything sound dreamy. But there's reasons why I think she's not looking for something more. First thing I'll mention is she's very quiet and shy in general. I think she has one other friend in the office on her team apart from me, and she has talked about feeling lonely before. About 2 months ago I asked her if she'd like to go to lunch one of the working days since the food we get in the office isn't great, and she basically said ""no it's ok"". Which is a big one for me, I feel like she'd have been all over that if she was truly interested. 

The other thing is that she rarely comes up to me, it's usually me going to her. In fairness, she has mentioned before that she doesn't want to feel like she's interrupting my work (I'm technically higher ranking than her and this is her first job) so it could just be that. She had car trouble recently and she felt bad that she had to ask me for help, but the truth was I was delighted she asked. So her rarely approaching me plays on my mind when I'm thinking of asking her out. It can be hard to get a read on her sometimes. But like I say, she seems happy to spend ages talking with me when \*I\* go to her.


I've never asked a girl out organically. Even on dating apps, it's always been after the girl nudging me or saying ""so are you gonna ask me out?"". So the thought of making the first move is scary, let alone in person. If she said no I'd respect that and not push her any further, but I'd be worried she'd be the kind to feel awkward about it and not want to even speak with me anymore. But at the same time I tend to overthink things a lot (as does she, as she has said to me funnily enough).
I still feel like taking the risk as I don't want to face into dating apps. This girl is really special and maybe even worth that risk in my opinion. Hell, might be good for my character development to ask a girl out face to face, whatever answer she gives.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

There was another big reason Doc Firestone was well liked.  He delivered Jim in 1969.  Jim was one of the first babies Doc Firestone would deliver.  He was about a year out of medical school (he studied at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, and Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore).  Since then, he has delivered other babies.  Doc Firestone delivered Audrey Holbrook’s three youngest (Malachi and Julie were born in Alamance County, while April Lynn, Ashley and Toni were born in Charlotte).  He also delivered all of Autumn Cavanaugh’s kids, Charmaine Cattrall’s two daughters, and he also delivered Leanne McClendon’s son, Todd.  Doc Firestone’s tradition of delivering babies would carry on to the kids.  He would deliver all five of Jim’s daughters, April Lynn’s son, all of Mark and Kendra’s daughters, Ashley’s son, Scout and Ariel’s son, all of Amy’s kids, all but one of Julie’s kids (Harmony was born at home but Doc Firestone would check her out), and he also delivered Kurt and Hannah’s daughter, Summer.  Doc Firestone vowed to continue being a doctor and delivering babies until he would not be able to do it any longer because he felt he owed something to every one of those kids.  And he drove two cars, a late model Jaguar and a classic Cadillac convertible.  Doc Firestone was married to a woman named Gwendolyn.  They had two daughters named Cyndi and Tatiana.  Cyndi was widowed with a son and three daughters, including one daughter who she and her late husband adopted.  She was from China.  Tatiana was single and had no children. 

Doc Firestone was waiting on the five.  He was very glad to see them.  But from the somber look on his face, it did not look good.  Doc Firestone said, “I’m glad you all are here.  I have some news about Lyle.”

Right away, Jim looked at Sydney and Autumn.  They both had the same somber looks on their faces as Doc Firestone.  Doc Firestone said, “I just got back from looking at Lyle.  I’m afraid it isn’t good.”

“How so?” Jim asked.

Doc Firestone continued by saying, “His pelvis is severely broken.  One kidney has been badly punctured and there’s no chance of it ever working again.  And there’s tremendous brain damage.  We’re keeping an eye on that right now.  His parents on their way here from Raleigh.  They’re going to have to make a rather tough decision.”

“Which would be?” Julie asked.

Doc Firestone spent about half a minute trying to find the words.  Finally, he said, “You all, there has been no brain activity, and it is highly possible there may not be any at all.  Their parents may be forced with the difficult decision to disconnect life support.”

Right away, everyone just lost it.  Julie and Sydney both started wailing.  Mark and Autumn just walked to the window to look outside and maybe try to drown out what Doc Firestone had just said.  Simon, Ariel and Jodi all just sat there, lost and confused.  Jim had been carrying the bottle of Pepsi and the Snickers bar Ariel wanted.  Jim just gave them to Ariel.  Right away, Jim felt he was about to lose the barbecue potato chips and Coke he had.  He could feel them lurching in his stomach. Jim went to join Mark and Autumn at the window.  The theme to *The Odd Couple* kept running through Jim’s mind, over and over.  He, along with Mark and Autumn, looked out the window.  The rain was still coming down hard.  Julie finally calmed down, walked to the window, and she said, “I guess I better call my mother and siblings and fill them in on what’s going on.”

Jim reached for Julie’s hand.  She squeezed Jim’s hand.  Then he squeezed hers.  Julie went to a corner of the waiting room and made her phone calls.  A few minutes later, Alex finally showed up.  At first, she thought everyone would be upset.  But that would not be the case.  Everyone was just glad she showed up.  Autumn filled Alex in on what Doc Firestone said.  Right away, Alex agreed it did not sound good.

About an hour later, Lyle’s parents showed up.  Jim asked one of the nurses to find Doc Firestone.  A few minutes later, Doc Firestone met with Lyle’s parents.  Everyone got a look at Doc Firestone and Lyle’s parents as they met and discussed Lyle’s condition.  Everyone was being prepared for the worst.

A few minutes later, Doc Firestone escorted Lyle’s parents back into the waiting room.  Those in the waiting room just looked at Doc Firestone, and he looked back at them.  They didn’t say a word. 

Finally, Julie said, “I think I’m about ready for another soda.”

Jim felt he was ready for another soda as well, and he agreed to join Julie.  Jim asked everyone if they wanted anything.  Everyone except Alex answered, and those who did answer did not want anything.  Julie walked to where Alex was standing (now she was looking out the window), and Julie touched her shoulder.  She asked her, “Alex, do you want anything from the coffee shop?”

At first, Alex did not seem to pay any attention to Julie.  But she did finally turn around to look at Julie.  She asked Alex once again if she wanted anything.  Alex said, “I’ll join you and Jim.”

Jim, Julie and Alex stepped into the hallway.  They took the elevator to the floor the coffee shop was on.  On the way, Jim said, “I guess I feel pretty sick, planning a get-together with all this going on.”

Julie said, “Jim, I guess I feel about as sick as you.  But I think we ought to go on with it, regardless.”

“What kind of get-together?” Alex asked.

Jim answered, “I was wanting us to get together and grill out some burgers, hot dogs and kabobs, and we are planning to cook some shrimp boil.  It’ll be this Sunday after church.  Would you be interested?”

Alex answered, “Yes, Jim.  I’ll be happy to come over.”

Then Julie said, “Alex, that’ll be great.  We’ll be happy to have you.”

Then Jim asked, “How was your date tonight, Alex?”

Alex answered, “It was okay.  Just a friend of mine.  We just had a sandwich at Subway, and then we went to see a movie.  Nothing more than that.”

The three stepped into the coffee shop.  Jim got him a bottle of Coke and a pack of cheese crackers.  Julie and Alex both got themselves a bottle of Coke.  Alex got her a candy bar.  Then they went back to the waiting room.  On the elevator ride, Jim told Alex about his decision to tell Valerie and Caitlyn about their mother, Candi.  Alex said, “Jim, I suppose that was a wise decision.”

Jim said, “Yes, and one I felt I held off for far too long.  They had questions, and I had answers.”

“Jim, I hope those answers were appropriate for their age,” Julie said.

“Yes, Julie.  They were.”

Then Alex said, “Jim, I suppose they had a right to know.  If they had a lot of questions, it was best that you gave them the answers.”

Jim stood on one side of the elevator.  Julie and Alex stood on the other side.  The elevator stopped.  When the door opened, there was a lot of wailing and crying going on.  Right away, the three knew it was not good news. 

The three got off the elevator very quickly, with Jim in the lead.  When they got off, they saw Autumn standing in the doorway, with Doc Firestone beside her.

Autumn quickly gave Jim a hug.  Then she gave Julie and Alex a hug.  Then Autumn said, “The parents made the decision to pull the plug.  Lyle died about fifteen minutes ago.”

Right away, Alex began sobbing.  Then Julie began crying.  Jim put his arm around Alex.  Julie stepped into the waiting room and sat down beside Sydney.  Julie held Sydney for a good five minutes.  Alex made her way into the waiting room, and she sat down beside Sydney.  Jim spoke with Doc Firestone.  Jim said, “This is one sad situation.  Kinda makes you numb, doesn’t it?”

Doc Firestone answered, “Yes, Jim.  It sure does.  No one wants to make a decision like the one Lyle’s parents made.  But I guess if nothing more can be done, then I suppose the decision has to be made.”

Everyone stayed for another fifteen minutes.  They all went into the room to say their goodbyes to Lyle.  Then everyone went out to the parking lot.  Jim was in the back of the crowd.  He seemed to be sick with sadness, and so were the others.  Julie hugged Sydney, and she told her to call or text her as soon as she got back to her house.  Then Julie took Jim by his arm, and she took him to her Volvo.  Amber stepped to the Volvo, and she said, “Julie, I’ll be glad to drive Jim home.” 

Julie said, “Amber, it’s okay.  I drove him here and I can drive him back.”

Amber asked, “Julie, can’t I drive him home, please?”

Jim looked at both Julie and Amber.  Then he made his decision.  “It’s okay, Julie.  Amber can drive me home.”

Right then, Julie got a text message.  Natalie was on call at the hospital.  She found out what happened, and she also found out about her mother being at the hospital.  Julie was sure Natalie would need a ride home.  Natalie would be off in about a half an hour, and she asked Julie to wait on her.  Since Julie would have to wait on Natalie, she allowed Amber to drive Jim home.

 

😊

 

Amber walked Jim to her cute little Honda Accord.  Amber opened the passenger door for Jim.  As Jim got in the car, Amber tilted her head to one side and smiled at him.  Right away, Jim remembered something.  That magazine article from *Esquire* he read back in 1983.  *If a girl tilts her head to one side, she’s interested in you*.  If Jim was interested in Amber (and he really wasn’t), he did not show it.

Amber drove her Honda on East Morehead Street back toward the neighborhood.  Amber and Jim did not say anything for about five minutes.  They just listened to the radio.  It was set to a soft rock station.  Jim saw the Sunbeam Bread Store on the left, just before Bethany Street.  Jim pointed to Bethany Street, and then he said, “Amber, I live on Bethany Street.  You should have turned left.”

But Amber just continued driving on East Morehead Street.  She took her right hand off the steering wheel, and she softly put it on his knee.  Amber just kept rubbing his knee.  Then, she finally said, “Jim, sweetheart.  I have not eaten all day.  I don’t wanna eat alone.  Can we stop somewhere and get a bite to eat?”

Amber just smiled at Jim, and she gazed her beautiful blue eyes at him.  Then it hit Jim.  Amber has the same color hair as Candi had.  Golden blonde hair.  Was it possible Amber was interested in Jim?

Before Jim could come with an answer, he decided to answer the question Amber had just asked him.  “I suppose we could get a bite to eat.  But we can’t stay out too long.  I really do need to get home to my girls.”

Amber turned onto South Tryon Street, as she passed Queen City Chevrolet, Jim pointed it out and said to her, “That’s it, Amber.  That’s my car dealership.”

Amber looked at the dealership and said, “So that’s Queen City Chevrolet.”

Jim said it was, and he said it with pride!  After she passed the dealership, Jim got a look at her.  Her knees pretty much reached the steering wheel.  The skirt of her red dress had gone almost halfway up her upper legs.  Amber was almost ready to pull the skirt up further, but Jim stopped her.  He did not really want to see anything she had.

Amber said she wanted to see where Jim worked.  She went around the block and was now on South Boulevard, headed toward uptown.  Jim wondered where Amber was going, but he didn’t ask questions.  He just sat there quietly.

Amber finally stopped at an all-night sandwich shop on Providence Road.  She said she found it one night after visiting patients at nearby Presbyterian Hospital.  It was still raining.  After she parked her car, Amber opened her umbrella, and she asked Jim to get under it with her. 

Jim and Amber sat at a table next to the window facing Providence Road.  Although it was almost two in the morning, there was plenty of traffic going up and down Providence Road.  There was hardly anyone in the sandwich shop.  Jim had already eaten dinner at home before Julie, Autumn and Mark hustled him off to Carolinas Medical Center.  He ate a bag of potato chips and a pack of crackers at the hospital.  But still, Jim ordered a small salad with blue cheese dressing, a small bag of plain potato chips, and he drank a Mountain Dew.  Amber ordered a meatball sub and a Diet Pepsi. 

They got their food.  They said grace, and then they ate.  Jim told Amber quite a bit about each of his girls.  He started off by telling her about Chelsea and about her finishing up her junior year in high school.  Then Jim told Amber about Lauren and about her plans to take driver education next school year and about Lindsay and her guitar playing, and about his telling Valerie and Caitlyn about their mother.  He told her about his mother, his father, and his half-siblings.  Jim also told Amber about how he knew everyone in the neighborhood since childhood, and how they did things together, and how they promised to be friends forever, no matter what.

In turn, Amber told Jim about her childhood.  She told him about competing for Miss Pennsylvania the year before she started seminary school, only to finish fifth.  Amber also told Jim about how close she was.  She also told him about her son Skylar, and how proud she was of him, and how he grew into a fine young man.  Amber also told Jim that she wanted to marry again and maybe have more kids. 

After they ate, Amber drove Jim home.  On the way, Jim asked Amber if she wanted to come over on Sunday after church for the get-together.  She said she would love to, and she would bring her son and sisters as well.  Amber admitted to Jim that she loved get-togethers as well, and she also loved putting them together, just like Jim did.

Amber pulled into Jim’s driveway.  Right away, she was amazed by how beautiful his place was.  She also liked the palm trees in his yard, and the flowers growing in the front of the house and the window flower boxes.  Before they got out of the car, Amber said, “I see a couple lights on.  One looks like the living room, and there’s one light on upstairs.”

Jim said, “Chelsea must be in the living room, waiting up for me.  And the one upstairs would be Caitlyn’s room and she’s supposed to be in bed.  And so is Chelsea.”

“You suppose they’re worried about you?” Amber asked.

Jim answered, “Yeah.  Maybe.”

Amber was the first out of the car.  It was still raining quite heavily, so Amber opened her umbrella.  She walked to the passenger side.  She opened the door and told Jim to get under the umbrella with her to stay dry.  Amber walked with Jim to his front door.  Amber said, “Jim, I enjoyed the company.”

Jim said, “So did I.  I wish the circumstances were better.”

Amber gave Jim a big hug.  She fought the urge to kiss him.  They just said their goodbyes to one another, and then she left.  Jim watched Amber as she walked back to her car.  Amber backed her car onto Bethany Street, and he watched as she made the turn onto Morehead Street.

Jim stepped into the house.  Sure enough, Chelsea was still up.  He asked her, “Chelsea, why are you still up?”

Chelsea answered, “I was waiting up for you, Dad.”

“I suppose you found out what happened.’

“Yes, Dad.  Brittany called me a while ago.  That’s so sad.”

Jim did not say anything.  He just looked at Chelsea.  Then he said, “It’s almost three o’ clock.  I guess we better head on upstairs to bed.”

Jim and Chelsea walked upstairs.  Chelsea walked into her bedroom, and she went to bed.  Jim walked to his bedroom.  But he saw a light on Caitlyn’s bedroom.  Jim walked into Caitlyn’s bedroom.  The light came from the Tinker Bell lamp on her nightstand.  Jim saw Caitlyn, asleep in her bed.  He saw the time on the Tinker Bell alarm clock on the nightstand beside the lamp.  Five minutes before three.  Caitlyn was lying on one side.  She rolled over, barely opened her eyes, and she saw Jim standing beside the bed.  She asked her, “Dad, what time is it?”

“Almost three and you should be asleep.  I’m going to turn off your lamp.”

Jim looked at her for about a minute, and then he said, “Honey, I’m sorry I left you and Valerie hanging when I was telling you two about your mother.  We had a situation this evening.  There’s a lot more to tell.  But right now, it’s time you got to sleep, okay?”

Jim turned off the lamp, and Caitlyn fell asleep.  Jim would tell Valerie and Caitlyn more about Candi.",1,1766927087.0,u_jim21869,0,1.0,False

On a warm Friday evening in May, Valerie and Caitlyn brought up the subject.  Maybe Jim had been putting off that subject for far too long.  Now, Jim’s two youngest daughters were finally about to find out about the mother they barely knew.       

The subject came up when Jim was getting ready to go to bed.  Valerie and Caitlyn stepped into Jim’s bedroom.  Valerie said, “Dad, we need to know something.  What was Mom like?” 

Jim looked at Valerie and Caitlyn for a moment, then he asked them, “Why do you two want to know?”

Valerie answered, “We need to know.  You talk about Mom to Chelsea, Lauren and Lindsay a lot.  But you never say anything to us about Mom.  Now we want to know.”

Then Caitlyn asked, “What was she like?”

Jim told the two girls to sit down on his bed.  Then he tried to find the words, hoping he could explain about Candi in a way girls of their age could understand.  Then, he finally started talking.  “Girls, your mother was like you and your sisters, in a lot of ways.  She was very sweet, pretty, caring, and she loved you all.  I see a lot of her in you girls.”

Then Valerie asked, “How did Mom die?”

Once again, Jim tried to come up with the words.  He wanted to explain it so that they could understand it.  After a moment, Jim said, “She and the preacher we had before Julie went on a plane ride.  The preacher’s brothers and his sister-in-law went with them.  The preacher was invited to preach for a revival in New Orleans.  But the plane didn’t make it to New Orleans.”

“What happened?” Caitlyn asked.

Jim answered, “The plane crashed in Mississippi.  A place called Hattiesburg.  It took about a week for a lot of people to find the plane.  Everyone on the plane died, along with your mother.”

“That’s a bad way to die,” Valerie said.

Jim said, “Yes, Valerie.  It sure is.”

Then Caitlyn said, “I can’t believe we barely knew her.”

“You girls were very young when she died.  I had to send you two to stay with your Nana Wendy and your Aunt Emily and Aunt Charlie.  You two stayed there for a few days.  Chelsea, Lauren and Lindsay stayed here with me.”

“Did Nana and our aunts live in Ballantyne at the time?” Valerie asked.

Jim answered, “Yes.  The same house they live in now.”

Wendy Faulkner, Jim’s mother along with her two daughters (two of his half-sisters), Emily and Charlie, lived in a part of south Charlotte called Ballantyne.  Jim went to their house every chance he could, and he took his daughters with him from time to time.  Most times, Jim and his daughters would eat at one of the many restaurants in Ballantyne.  Wendy, Emily and Charlie would join them on occasion. 

Then Caitlyn had another question.  “Dad, how did Mom look?”

Jim held up his hand, and said, “Hold on a moment.”

Jim stepped into one the two closets in his bedroom.  He took out two things.  First, a big shoebox.  Second, a huge photo album.  Jim sat back down on his bed between Valerie and Caitlyn.  Jim opened up the shoebox.  The first thing Jim showed the two girls was a photo of Jim and Candi at their wedding.  Caitlyn said, “Wow!  She was pretty.  She looked like a pretty model.”

Jim said, “Yes, Caitlyn.  She sure did.”

Caitlyn said, “That was a beautiful dress.”

Then Valerie said, “The wedding looked awesome.”

Jim said, “Yes, it did.  We chose a tropical theme.  We had seashells, palm trees, and the cake was made out in different colors.  It was beautiful.”

Then Jim took out another picture.  He said, “This is me at my high school graduation.  Your mother and my mother were with me.  And so was my father and your Aunt Renee.”

“I know they were very proud of you,” Valerie said.

Jim said, “Yes.  They were.”

Then Caitlyn said, “Mom must have really liked to dress nice.  I see she wore a dress or a skirt.”

Jim said, “Yes.  She did.  She was very pretty.  Just like you girls.”

Then Jim took out another photo and said to the girls, “I want you girls to see something else.  This picture was taken at church the day after our wedding.”

The photo was taken when Jim and Candi were baptized by Reverend Q…together.  Valerie asked, “Dad, when and where was this picture taken?”

Jim answered, “Something I hope you girls get, someday.  Baptized.  That picture was taken in church by your Nana.  Your Mom and I were baptized together.  And believe me, it was a beautiful thing.”

Caitlyn’s attention went back to the wedding photo.  And to the shirt Jim was wearing.  It wasn’t a dress shirt!  But he was wearing a jacket and slacks.  It was a T-shirt, with a motor oil brand.  He was also wearing a golf cap.  Caitlyn asked Jim, “What’s Valvoline?  And why were you wearing a T-shirt with a suit and that cap?”

Jim answered, “Valvoline is a popular brand of motor oil.  And I decided to wear that shirt to my wedding.  And that cap is a golf cap.  I decided to wear both to my wedding.”

Valerie asked, “Were Mom and Nana upset?’

Jim laughed a little, and he said, “No.  In fact, they enjoyed it.  Nana said it was my wedding and my decision.”

Caitlyn took out yet another baptismal photo.  She noticed something.  She asked, “Was Mom really baptized in a wedding dress?”

Jim answered, “Yes, she sure was.  I found that to be a bit unusual.  But that was what she wanted.  I guess I could say it was beautiful.”

Then Caitlyn asked, “Who was that pretty brunette girl?”

Jim answered, “That pretty brunette girl is April Lynn when she was younger.  She got baptized that Sunday morning also.  She was a bridesmaid at our wedding.  She got baptized in the dress she was wearing as a bridesmaid.”

“You knew April Lynn back then?” Valerie asked.

“Yes.  And Julie, Malachi, Ashley, Toni, Mark, Kendra, Alex, Sydney, Simon, Ariel, Jodi, Tia, Vince, Marissa, Kurt, Jeremy, Hannah, Russell, Scout, Paulina, Jonathan, Zoe, Allison, Jonah and Catalina.  I also hung out with Reverend Q and Anna and the parents of my friends.  We were good friends then, and we still are!”

“Wow!  You knew everybody then and now!” Caitlyn exclaimed.

“We sure did,” Jim said.

Then Valerie asked, “Was that Reverend Q baptizing you all?”

Jim answered, “Yes.  You know Anna Quattlebaum and her daughter Madison from the church?  Anna was his wife and Madison’s their daughter.”

Valerie said, “We know.  They talk about him a lot.”

Then Jim said, “And your mother and I and a guy named Todd McClendon used to hang out together as well.”

“You mean Julie’s husband?” Valerie asked.

Jim answered, “Yes.  Todd died in a car wreck not long after Mom died.”

Caitlyn said, “I know.  Julie told us once.”

Then Jim said, “And girls, I’ll have you know I graduated from high school, got married, and got baptized…all in one weekend!”

Valerie exclaimed, “Wow, Dad!  You stayed busy that weekend!”

Jim said, “Yes.  I most certainly did.”

Jim took the photos and put them back into the shoebox.  Then he put the shoebox behind him on the bed.  He took the photo album.  He showed the girls the first page.  On the page was a newspaper clipping.  It was from *The* *Charlotte Observer* and it said, *Charlotte Pastor Among Five Missing*.  That referred to Jason Courtland, the minister at Salem Church at the time.  There was also mention of Candi and Reverend Courtland’s brothers, and the wife of one of those brothers.  The newspaper reported about Reverend Courtland’s plans to preach at a revival service in New Orleans.  It also reported about the plane going down in Mississippi. 

There was also another newspaper article.  This one was the one where the bodies were found in a part of Mississippi near Hattiesburg.  And there was also a newspaper obituary for Candi.  It did not take Valerie and Caitlyn long to recognize their names.  There was also an obituary for Reverend Courtland.

“When and how did you two meet?” Valerie asked.

Jim answered, “We met at a get-together.  We had an opportunity to meet a new pastor by the name of Al Quattlebaum and his wife.  That’s also where I met Pam Gilmore and her kids, Russell and Scout and Paulina.  That was in 1984 and we were all young at the time.  Candi, your mother, walked to where I was sitting and eating.  We got to know each other.  We became boyfriend and girlfriend.”

“And the rest, as they say, is history,” Valerie said.

Jim said, “Things got more and more serious, rather quickly.”

“How so?” Caitlyn asked.

At that moment, Jim got up, walked to the closet, and took out yet another photo album.  This one did not have as many pages, or as many photos.  This photo album was one Jim made in 1984, after the trip to the mountains with the Salem Church Youth Ensemble.  Julie was the one who took most of the photos.  When Julie had the film developed, she gave copies of the photos to Jim, her siblings, and some of her friends.  Not all of the photos in the album were from those two trips (the South Carolina coast and the mountains of North Carolina).  Some of them were from the last part of 1983 and the early part of 1984.  Jim showed Valerie and Caitlyn the photos.  Jim was only too proud to show them the photos.  He showed them photos from Luke’s gas station, Pam’s used car lot (where Jim was working at the time), the Sunbeam Bread Store, and from the neighborhood park.  Jim also showed them a photo Wendy took of him and Candi that Easter.  It did not take Valerie and Caitlyn long to recognize everyone in those photos.  They recognized Jim and all his friends in the younger days.  Valerie and Caitlyn knew that, even then, they all looked as good as they looked now. 

“Dad, you worked at Pam Gilmore’s used car lot back then?” Valerie asked.

“Yes.  I really enjoyed it.  Paulina worked with me as well.”

“What did you do there?” Caitlyn asked Jim.

“I did a lot of things.  I washed cars, helped out in the office, and I even sold some cars.  That job was my first one.  It helped me reach my goal of being a car dealer.”

Valerie said, “I see you all had a lot of fun together.”

“Yes, Valerie.  We did.  We became friends.  We were there for each other through good times and bad, just like now.”

Jim turned the pages of the photo album.  He showed Valerie and Caitlyn the photos from the youth ensemble trip to the mountains.  The first photo he showed them was one Julie took of him and Candi on the bus.  Valerie and Caitlyn recognized Paulina Gilmore and Sydney Cavanaugh sitting behind them.  Then Jim showed the girls a photo of the race car he and some of the guys on the trip saw at that convenience store in Catawba County.  That race car was a 1969 Chevelle, and it was being hauled on a trailer that was being pulled by an orange Chevy truck.  Valerie and Caitlyn seemed to be impressed by the race car.  Valerie said, “Dad, you sure liked cars even then.  I can see that.”

“Yes, Valerie.  I did.  And so did all my friends.  And we still do.”

Then Valerie said, “Dad, I can see why you all became friends.  You all have a lot in common.”

Then Jim showed the girls photos of the ensemble singing at that church in Lansing (Julie had Luke take those photos).  He also showed them some photos of Jim playing the guitar and Todd playing keyboards and April Lynn, Candi, Paulina and Sydney singing.  He also showed them one of Sydney was holding an empty can of Valvoline Motor Oil (when they did that commercial parody).  Once again, Caitlyn had a question about the T-shirt Jim was wearing.  “Dad, why were you wearing a Valvoline T-shirt in church?”

“It was like this.  Reverend Q gave me and the boys T-shirts.  He gave the girls dresses.  He gave me the Valvoline shirt.  As you can see, Todd was wearing a Firestone shirt, Kurt wore a Champion Spark Plug shirt, Vince wore a B.F. Goodrich shirt, and Mark wore an Esso shirt.  The others wore car T-shirts.  That was what Reverend Q wanted.  And the girls wore dresses.  And boy did they look pretty!”

Caitlyn agreed with Jim and said, “Yes, Dad.  They sure did.”

“You weren’t even there, Caitlyn,” Valerie said.

Jim hugged both girls.  Then he said, “It’s okay, girls.  You didn’t have to be.  They looked pretty.  Just like you and your sisters.”

“Didn’t you all go to Asheville also?” Valerie asked.

Jim answered, “Yes, we did.  And I have a few pictures from there.”

Jim showed Valerie and Caitlyn the photos Julie took in Asheville.  Most of them were outside.  One of the photos was one where the whole ensemble gathered in the parking lot of a shopping center, with the mountains as a backdrop.  Marissa, who was in her wheelchair, was sitting in front of the bunch, with Vince sitting beside her.  Valerie asked, “Who are those two standing beside you and Mom?”

Jim answered, “The older one is Charmaine Cattrall, Ariel’s mother.  And the younger one is her sister, Jodi.  She’s about a year and half younger than me.”

Jim showed Valerie and Caitlyn some more photos.  He showed them one of him fishing on The Battery in Charleston when he and Candi took their honeymoon.  He also showed them one of Candi holding baby Emily, and another of her holding baby Charlie.  It did not take Valerie and Caitlyn long to recognize their Aunt Emily and Aunt Charlie as babies.

Then Jim showed them one of Candi accepting her nursing degree when she graduated from nursing school.  “Mom was a nurse, wasn’t she?” Caitlyn asked.

Jim looked at Caitlyn and answered, “Yes, honey.  She was.  And a good nurse at that.  Your oldest sister, Chelsea, was born not long after Candi became a nurse.  She wanted to finish nursing school before having kids.  We both wanted to have a family.”

“Did she ever want a boy?” Valerie asked.

Jim answered, “Yes.  When she died, we talked about having one more child, and we hoped it could be a boy.”

“So sad that didn’t happen,” Valerie said.

Jim said, “Yes, it was sad.”

Then Valerie said, “I guess I would like to be a nurse when I grow up.”

Jim let out a laugh and said, “You girls can be anything you want to be, if you set your minds to it.”

The bedroom door was open.  When Jim said that to Valerie and Caitlyn, Chelsea stepped into the room.  She had a can of Coke in her hand.  Jim looked up at Chelsea, and he gave her a smile.  Chelsea smiled back at him.  Then Chelsea said, “Hi, Dad.  I see you and my two youngest sisters are having quite a time in here.”

Jim let out a little laugh, and then he said, “Yes, Chelsea.  We are.  We’re going back in time.  You want to join us?”

Chelsea did not say a word.  She just stepped to a chair in the bedroom and sat down.  Jim continued to show Valerie and Caitlyn photos, and he continued to tell them about Candi.  He also showed them “just born” photos of each of the girls. 

Chelsea picked up the photo album from Jim and Candi’s wedding.  She looked at one photo and said, “Dad, I cannot believe you wore a T-shirt and a cap.  And at your own wedding.”

Jim said, “Everyone else thought it looked nice.”

Then Caitlyn said, “Mom got baptized in her wedding dress.”

“Really?  I’ll bet that was something,” Chelsea said.

Then Valerie said, “Dad graduated from high school, got married, and got baptized, all in one weekend.”

Chelsea said, “I know.  Dad told me.”

Then Chelsea picked up another photo album.  She looked at a beautiful photo of Candi.  Jim saw Chelsea was trying her level best to fight back tears.  Chelsea did manage to say, “Mom sure was beautiful.”

Jim looked at Chelsea, and he said to her, “Yes, honey.  She sure was.  And I was telling Valerie and Caitlyn how much of your mother I see in you girls.”

“I can see where my sisters and I get our beautiful looks,” Chelsea said.

Jim asked Chelsea, “Are your sisters still up?”

Chelsea answered, “Lindsay’s almost asleep.  Lauren’s still up.”

Jim said, “Chelsea, I am glad I told you and Lauren and Lindsay about your mother.  Tonight, I was finally able to tell Valerie and Caitlyn about her.”

“Are you two learning everything about Mom?” Chelsea asked.

Valerie answered, “Yes, and I’m glad Dad told us about Mom.”

Caitlyn added, “Mom was beautiful.”

Then Jim said, “They’re learning a lot.”

Then Jim went to something else.  He said, “Girls, twenty-seven years ago in 1984, me and your mother and our friends took a couple of trips.  We were part of the church’s youth singing ensemble.  We first went to Charleston and North Myrtle Beach.  Then, a few weeks later, we went to the mountains.  The trip to the mountains was the one we would remember the most.  One evening in the backyard of a house in Ashe County, we all got together.  We made a promise to remain friends forever, no matter what.  Your mother and I were part of that promise.”

“Who all were part of this promise?” Valerie asked.

Jim answered, “A lot of us.  Malachi and his sisters, Julie and April Lynn and Ashley.  Mark, Simon, Alex and Sydney Cavanaugh.  Jodi and Ariel Cattrall.  A girl from Brazil named Tia Mendes.  Vince and Marissa Crabtree.  Mark was dating Kendra when she was known as Kendra Braddock, and she was also in on it.  Kurt was dating Hannah.  She was known as Hannah Duncan.  Todd McClendon was with us.  Russell, Scout and Paulina Gilmore were part of that promise as well.”

“Were any of the parents there?” Chelsea asked.

Jim answered, “Yes.  My mother was there.  And so were Autumn Cavanaugh, Charmaine Cattrall, Leanne McClendon and Pam Gilmore.  And of course, there was Reverend Q and Anna.”

“What about the Holbrooks and the Barretts?” Valerie asked.

Jim answered, “Audrey didn’t make the trip.  But Luke showed up at that church we performed at that evening.”

“Where were Audrey, Randy and Lori?” Valerie asked.

Jim answered, “Audrey was at home in Charlotte, having baby Toni.  Randy and Lori were at home with baby Jeremy.  Lori made the trip to the mountains, but Randy did not make either trip.”

“Toni and Jeremy were just born at the time?” Caitlyn asked.

“Yes,” Jim answered.

“Some trip!” Caitlyn exclaimed.

Then Jim said, “I told you girls this story because I wanted to prove something.  A promise can be very special, especially this one.  After twenty-seven years, we are still holding true to that promise.  Or at least, most of us are.”

Chelsea said, “A promise is a promise, and it should be kept.”

Valerie added, “I like it you all stayed friends after all those years.”

Then Jim said, “And I’m glad you girls have interest in becoming part of the singing ensemble Julie is wanting to start up in church.  And I’m glad the other kids are also.”

Chelsea said, “Lindsay plays the guitar very well, and I know Ryan can really play the keyboards.”

At that moment, they all heard the doorbell ring several times.  They hoped neither Lindsay nor Lauren would answer it because this conversation seemed to be getting good.  But Lauren announced that she would answer it.  Jim continued to tell the girls about that trip, and about Candi.  “We walked from the house we were staying at to a grocery store in town.  I got me some toy cars, and I also got a ring.  But not just any ring.  A promise ring.  When we got back to the house, I gave your mother that ring.  And with that, we became serious.  That, along with making that promise, was a beautiful moment.  I’ll never forget those trips to the beach and the mountains or that place if I live to be a hundred.”

“Where was this place?” Valerie asked.

Jim answered, “It was in a small town called Lansing.  It’s in Ashe County, in the far northwestern part of North Carolina.”

Then Jim showed them photos of him proposing to Candi.  It was at the Indianapolis 500 in 1987.  Jim got down on one knee and popped the question to Candi in front of the race car of the winner of the race that year, Al Unser, Sr.  The car was yellow and was numbered 25.  Jim’s father, Walter Faulkner took Jim and Candi to the race, along with Kate and Renee.  Walter managed to get a pass for himself, Jim, Candi and Renee to meet the race winner in Victory Lane.  Jim wanted to propose to Candi at the Indianapolis 500, and he did just that.  What Jim did not know was that the ABC Television Network had their cameras shooting Jim proposing to Candi.  But it didn’t really matter.  Candi still said yes!  

Valerie asked, “Dad, wasn’t Mom embarrassed by that, I mean you proposing marriage to her at a public sporting event and the whole thing being on every TV set in America?”

“If she was, she never let me know about it.  She said it was memorable.”

Then Valerie brought up something else.  “Dad, we finally learned something new in school.”

“Oh, yes.  And what was that?” Jim asked Valerie.

Valerie answered, “We learned about how babies are made!”

Right then, Jim put one hand in front of his face and mumbled, “Huh, boy!”

And then, Lauren shouted from downstairs, “Dad, come down here!  Autumn’s here and she’s got Julie and Mark with her and it doesn’t sound good!”

Jim threw up his hands and said, “Thank heavens.”  Then he and the girls ran downstairs as fast as they could.  When they got down there, they could see Autumn and Mark and Julie were quite upset.  Autumn said in tears and sobs, “Jim, please come with us.”

“Why?  What’s wrong?” Jim asked.

Julie answered, “Jim, it’s Lyle McPherson.  He was badly injured in a wreck at a car race tonight.  And it doesn’t look good at all.”

 

😊

 

Right away, Jim ran upstairs and got some clothes on.  He heard rumbles of thunder.  It seemed as though a thunderstorm was about to take place.  The doorbell must have woke Lindsay up.  Lauren and Lindsay remained downstairs, while the other three girls went upstairs to Jim’s bedroom.  Julie walked into the room behind the girls.  Caitlyn asked, “Dad, is there more to tell us about Mom?”

Jim said, “Yes, honey.  There is.  But I’ll tell you and Valerie more later.  I promise.”

Then Valerie asked, “Dad, is everything all right?”

Jim answered, “Girls, I’m not sure.  Right now, I have to go.  Chelsea’s in charge, and no trouble.  Please do exactly what Chelsea tells you.”

The girls agreed.  Chelsea said, “Dad, please be careful.  Looks like we may have a storm coming.  Let us know how everything turns out.”

Jim said he would, and the girls left the bedroom.  He told Chelsea to see the younger girls off to bed after he left.  Jim also told Chelsea to lock the doors and windows after he left, including all deadbolt locks.  Julie looked at the stuff on his bed.  Julie picked up one of the photo albums, and she asked him, “Jim, what went on in this bedroom tonight?”

“I’ll tell you about it on the way to the hospital.”

And with that, everyone left the house.  Autumn and Mark rode to the hospital together.  Jim rode with Julie.

 

😊

 

Lyle McPherson was dating Sydney, but they were nowhere near serious.  He was about the same age as Sydney.  Lyle and those in the neighborhood were good friends.  Jim gave Lyle racing advice from time to time even though he drove a Dodge truck as a “daily driver” and raced in either an old Ford or an old Mercury.  Lyle was in the heating and air conditioning repair business, and he worked for one of Charlotte’s most successful heating and air conditioning repair businesses.  They even sponsored his racing team, putting his name on his two racing cars. 

Julie was telling Jim what happened.  Tonight, he was at the speedway in Hickory in a 1966 Ford Galaxie made into a race car.  Julie was not at the race, but she got everything from Autumn and Mark, who were at the race.  Lyle took a turn too hard at the track, and his Ford flipped over a few times.  The car’s fuel tank ruptured and exploded.  It took firefighters and first responders about ten minutes to get Lyle out of the car.  After they got him out, he was airlifted to Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte.  Now, Lyle was in very critical condition, and his injuries were life-threatening.  From what Julie said, Lyle’s chances of survival were not good.

Jim and Julie began to wonder about Sydney.  After all, she was their friend.  Sydney was part of that special promise they made in 1984 to remain friends, no matter what may happen.  Sydney was now an interior decorator in Charlotte, and she seemed to be doing very well in her job.  Jim and Julie felt this was not what Sydney wanted or needed right now.  Lyle and Sydney were just days from maybe letting things between them become serious.  Jim and Julie wondered what Sydney was going to do if Lyle was not to make it through this ordeal.

Julie shifted to another subject.  Before she made it to the hospital, she asked, “Jim, what was going on tonight, with the photo albums and all that?”

Jim answered, “Julie, I told Valerie and Caitlyn about their mother.”

“Jim, you just now telling them two about Candi?  How did they take it?”

“We enjoyed the talk.  They seemed to have taken it pretty good.”

“And you showed them all those photos, huh?”

“Yes, Julie.  And they both agreed you and the others looked good back then, just as you do now.”

“Thanks, Jim.  It seems to me you all had a good conversation about Candi.”

“I felt it was time Valerie and Caitlyn knew about their mother,” Jim said.

Then Julie said, “They were both young when Candi died in that plane crash.’

“I know.  But I will tell them more,” Jim said.

Julie stopped at the traffic light at the corner of Morehead Street and Kings Drive, with Carolinas Medical Center at the corner.  The thunderstorm seemed to be pretty bad.  The thunder got louder, the wind blew very hard, lightning danced all around, hail was coming down, and it rained a lot harder.  Jim and Julie both figured it would rain more than an inch from this storm.  Julie got ready to turn her Volvo SUV onto Kings Drive.  A song was playing on the radio, which was on a Charlotte oldies station.  Gerry and the Pacemakers.  A well-known sixties music group from England.  *Don’t Let the Sun Catch You Crying*.  Maybe the song went well with this stormy evening.  And for this evening, it would not be the only time Jim would hear that song.

Julie turned onto Kings Drive and pulled into the parking lot of Carolinas Medical Center.  Carolinas Medical Center started life as Charlotte Memorial Hospital.  The hospital has been named Carolinas Medical Center since 1990. 

Julie managed to find the emergency entrance.  After she parked her Volvo, she opened her umbrella.  She walked to the passenger side and opened the door.  She let Jim out, and she asked him to get under the umbrella with her.  Just as they got out of the Volvo, Autumn and Mark showed up.  Mark was driving Autumn’s Camaro.  He parked next to Julie’s Volvo.

The four walked into the hospital.  Autumn went to the desk to check on Lyle.  Jim, Mark and Julie walked into the waiting room.  Right away, they saw Sydney.  She was just sitting there, looking frozen.  She seemed to be staring off into space.  Jim sat down beside Sydney.  He slowly put his arm around her, hoping it would reassure her.  But it really didn’t.  Mark stood at a window and just looked outside.  The storm was still very bad and it was still raining quite hard.  But the Charlotte skyline was still quite visible.  Julie stood in a corner of the waiting room, wondering what was going on, and what she could do to make Sydney feel better.

Jim kept his arm around Sydney.  After a few minutes, Sydney finally moved.  She slowly put her arm around Jim, and she put her head on his shoulder.  Jim felt the silk of Sydney’s white blouse against his arm.  In addition to that blouse, Sydney was also wearing a black skirt and black pantyhose and she also had a silk scarf around her neck.  Sydney looked around the room and gave everyone a smile. 

Autumn stepped into the room.  She said, “I just got through speaking with one of the nurses.  She said it doesn’t look good at all.”

“How so?” Julie asked.

Autumn answered, “He’s burned badly.  Not only that, he had a punctured lung, one kidney is not working, and his pelvis is severely fractured.  Doctors are not sure much can be done.”

“Not good news at all,” Jim said.

Everyone tried to keep their voices down to keep Sydney from worrying.  She already seemed to be worried, maybe more than she needed to be.  Simon and Ariel showed up, and they had Jodi with them.  Simon and Ariel said their son was staying with April Lynn at her house.  Jim wondered if anyone had got a hold of Alex.  Simon said, “She’s out on a date.  Ariel and I have tried to get a hold of her, but she’s not answering her cell phone.”

Then Jodi said, “They’re probably in a movie theater.  You can’t have a cell phone on in there.”

Then Julie asked, “A movie theater?  At this time of night?”

Julie got a look at her watch.  It was 12:15 in the morning.  Jim said, “Julie, a lot of movie theaters tend to stay open quite late.  It’s been some time since I've been in one.”

It had been about three years since Jim had set foot inside a movie theater.  The movie was *Mamma Mia*.  That was back in 2008.  Jim had seen some movies during 2007 and 2008 (including the evening of the plane crash).  Before *Mamma Mia*, the last time he was in a movie theater was in 1984, and he was on a date with Candi.  The movie was *Gremlins*.  After that, Jim felt that movies had gotten so expensive over the years.   Jim felt it was best to wait until the movie came out on video (or DVD in later years). 

Julie said, “I could really use a soda right about now.  Anyone wish to go downstairs to the coffee shop with me?”

Jim said he would.  Julie asked the others if they wanted anything.  Ariel wanted a soda and a candy bar.  Mark and Simon both said they would go with Jim and Julie and get him a cup of coffee.  Autumn and Jodi did not want anything.  Jim asked Sydney if she wanted anything.  She did not say anything.  He just looked at her.  Then Jim said, “I guess not.”

They walked downstairs to the hospital’s coffee shop.  On the way, Mark tried to get a hold of Alex.  He had no luck.  Maybe her cell phone was still cut off.  Then Julie said, “Boy, this doesn’t look good.  I sure hope Lyle pulls through.”

Jim said, “So do I.  If he doesn’t, I don’t know what Sydney’s going to do.”

Then Mark said, “Just remember that promise we made a long time ago at that house in Lansing.  Sydney’s still got all of us.”

“Yes, that’s true,” Simon said.

Then Julie said, “Guys, let’s try to think positive.  I know it doesn’t look good.  But we must stay strong, if only for Sydney’s sake.”

They got on the elevator for the ride to the floor the coffee shop was on.  Before the elevator stopped, Mark asked, “Julie, have you heard from Malachi lately?”

Malachi and Stacy were in the neighborhood just two weeks earlier.  They were about to move into a house on Bethany Street.  Malachi and Stacy’s kids, Michaela (known as Micki) and Chandler, stayed with some of Stacy’s relatives in Boston while Malachi and Stacy were in Charlotte, looking at the house.  Julie answered, “Mark, I heard from Malachi this evening before I had to leave for the hospital.  From what I’ve been told, he and Stacy and the kids will be here tomorrow.”

Jim asked, “Julie, did you happen to tell Malachi what happened this evening?”

Julie answered, “Bits and pieces.  I didn’t want to upset him now.  After all, he and Stacy and the kids will be in Charlotte tomorrow.”

“Any idea what time they’ll arrive?” Simon asked.

Julie answered, “Malachi said they would be leaving quite early in the morning.  He says he wanted to be in Charlotte as early tomorrow afternoon as possible.  He also said he wants to stay behind the van line truck all the way from Boston to Charlotte.”

The elevator stopped.  The four made their way to the coffee shop.  When they got into the coffee shop, Julie had received a text message.  After she checked it out, she said, “Guys, that was Amber.  She said she just parked her car.  I’m gonna text her back and tell her to meet us in the coffee shop.”

Mark said, “I hope she can find us.  I don’t know if she’s been to Carolinas Medical Center since she arrived in Charlotte.”

Julie said, “I’m sure she’ll ask someone, a doctor or a nurse maybe.”

Jim got him a bottle of Coke and a bag of barbecue potato chips.  Mark and Julie both got themselves a cup of coffee.  Simon got him a tuna salad sandwich, a bag of plain potato chips and a bottle of Sprite.  Mark tried once again to get a hold of Alex.  “She must still have her phone off,” Mark said.

Then Julie said, “I hope we get a hold of Alex soon.”

“I’m sure Alex will call or text one of us soon,” Jim said.

Then, Amber showed up.  Julie waved for Amber to join them.  In the back of Jim’s mind, he thought, *Oh, boy!  I hope no one tries to arrange my life.  Not now*.

Over the past few weeks, Renee and Rachel tried their best to get Jim and Amber to hook up and become boyfriend and girlfriend.  The others tried to stay out of it, and if Jim and Amber decided to hook up, then so be it.  Amber sat down with them.  She was wearing a red dress with a neckline that did show a good bit of cleavage.  She asked everyone how they were doing.  She got a look at everyone, and it seemed obvious to her that everyone was on pins and needles.  Amber walked to the counter and got herself a bottle of Diet Coke.  It was all she wanted right now.

Julie told Amber everything.  She told about the accident, of Lyle’s condition, of how Sydney was doing, and she also told Amber about Malachi and his family arriving in Charlotte the next day. 

Mark finally got a text from Alex.  She said she was out of the movie theater.  Mark texted Alex to get a hold of him, Simon or Autumn as quickly as possible.  Hopefully, she would.  Mark also got a hold of Kurt Barrett, then he got a hold of Vince and Marissa Crabtree.  After the Crabtrees, Mark called the Gilmores and informed them of the situation.  He would keep them all informed of Lyle’s condition.

Then, Jim happened to remember something.  “Guys, you know what race happens to be taking place this weekend?”

“The Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte Motor Speedway?” Mark asked.

Jim said, “You’re partly right.  But I’m thinking of two other big races that take place on Memorial Day weekend.  The Monaco Grand Prix and The Indianapolis 500.”

Oh, yes!  The Monaco Grand Prix and the Indy 500!  Jim’s two favorite races take place that holiday weekend.  He knew them quite well.  It was at the Indy 500 he proposed to Candi back in 1987.  Since then, Jim had been seeing it on TV.  This year would be no different. 

Jim said, “Guys, we’re gonna have to cook up a really good get-together this weekend.”

Julie said, “Jim, I agree.  We should do it at my house.  I got that new gas grill I got at Home Depot a few months ago.  We can grill out some burgers and hot dogs.”

Then Simon added, “I got some shrimp, small ears of corn, smoked sausage and potatoes.  Put all that together with butter and Old Bay Seasoning, and you got something good.  Shrimp boil, they call it.  I can bring some shrimp, corn, smoked sausage and potatoes, and we can do a shrimp boil.”

Jim said, “Good thinking, Simon.  I got some butter and Old Bay Seasoning.  I can bring them if it’s okay.”

Then Julie said, “Shrimp boil sounds good.  I’d also like to do some kabobs if that’s okay.”

“Shrimp can make for some good kabobs,” Simon said.

Jim said, “So can cut up boneless chicken breasts.”

Julie said, “Yes, they do.  Put shrimp and chicken on the same kabob together with some peppers and onions, and you have something good.”

Jim said, “I got peppers.  Red, yellow and green ones.  I also got some onions.”

Amber said, “You all must know how to do get-togethers.”

Jim said, “In our neighborhood, it seems to be our specialty.”

Then Mark added, “And we have lots of fun!”

Then Julie said, “Then I guess it’s all set.  We can do it after church on Sunday.  Let’s do it at my house.”

Everyone seemed to be in agreement.  Even Amber said she would join in.  She said she would bring her son and sisters. 

Then, Julie got a text message.  She checked her phone.  Then she said, “Guys, that was Malachi.  I guess they decided to get on the road earlier than I thought.  They’re almost in New York City and should make Charlotte sometime tomorrow afternoon if all goes well.”

Jim said, “That’s good, Julie.  Maybe he and his wife and kids can join us on Sunday.”

Then Jim got a text message.  He looked at his phone to check his message.  He said, “You all, that was Jodi.  We gotta get back to the waiting room now.  Maybe something about Lyle.”

Simon wolfed down the last of his tuna salad sandwich.  Everyone took their drinks with them.  They all headed for the elevator as fast as they could.  They got ready to go back to the waiting room.

First impression sa menu, maka ingon jud ka nga weird ang combination sa ingredients (see pic of the menu!), but we soon realized that they really live up to their tagline — confusingly delicious. 

What we ordered:

1. Furikake fries - 5/10. Okay na, the usual french fries with the umami flavor from the furikake. 

2. Baby Squid w/ Salted Egg - 7/10 squid was very tender and crispy, and dili bidli paresan sa salted egg sauce. I think they use Crispy Fry breading kay familiar man kaayo ang taste lol

3. Sibujing Chicken Confit - 9/10 Perfect balance of the saltiness of a typical roast chicken and the sweetness of caramelized onions. Chicken thigh was so tender and juicy, served with a side of potato wedges that were  also well-seasoned and tender. 

4. Beef Kolbasz - 8/10 dako kaayo ang sausage lol and well seasoned, served with dilis rice and a salad. Though I think na overshadow ang dish sa side salad because the dressing was soooo good, sweet and salty with a bit of a nutty taste. 

5. Bicol Express Salmon - 9/10 was expecting the creamy bicol express sauce on top of the salmon, pero gi sabaw siya sa rice. Dili anghit ang salmon and very tender and well-seasoned. 

6. Dilis Pasta - 8/10 nag expect ko nga murag aglio olio, like more on oil lang ang sauce. But it was actually served with a poached egg, making it creamy to go with the briney flavor of the dilis. Medyo bidli lang kadugayan, but still lami. 

7. Latik Cheesecake - 9/10 never thought latik would go great on a no-bake cheesecake! Surprisingly di ra pud kaayo sweet. We ordered this for Christmas and everyone at the party loved it. 

Other comments:

1. Customer service was great, very attentive and mag ask jud ug feedback about the food. 

2. Lisod ang parking. Though pwede ka mag pay parking sa New Dawn Hotel which is only a few steps away. 

3. Idk what their interior design style is called, but I'm into it. Pati CR nice lol

4. Walay pork dishes

First of all, have been on and off a coffee enthousiast. Recently i've got it in my head that I have to get a profitec go and step in a new espresso journey. 

I have a moccamaster which is the most used item in my home. I pair it with a barratza encore (non-esp). I also have an aeropress, french press, bialetti, ....

But long story short, before i go for the big machine itself (the profitec) I need to upgrade my grinder. But .... there are so many. The options are way to overwhelming and when i research a grinder and think i made a decision, another option comes up that's just a little bit more expensive (or i saw a review that has too many negative vibes about a grinder). And then the doubting begins. Why not spend a little bit more for a better grinder? But is it better? You get the gist :).

What i do know for sure is that I want a single dose grinder. I like to keep my beans in a vacuum container container. And i need it to be easy to switch from grinding for a drip coffee to an espresso and back (stepless adjustment has my preference but isn't a must). 

So far i've looked in the mahlkönig X64, the timemore 064s. And actually loads of others which I don't remember at this point. 

As far as price range, I would say around €500 or €600 euros.

1pxqgi3,https://www.reddit.com/r/MotivationByDesign/comments/1pxqgi3/how_to_always_have_something_funny_to_say_the/,How to Always Have Something Funny to Say: The PSYCHOLOGY That Actually Works,"I spent way too long being the quiet person in group conversations. You know the type, laugh at everyone's jokes but freeze when it's your turn to contribute. Then I'd spiral thinking about all the ""perfect"" responses I could've said 3 hours later in the shower.

Turns out, being funny isn't some genetic lottery. After diving deep into standup comedy specials, improv techniques, and psychology research on humor, I realized most of us are approaching this completely wrong. We think we need to be naturally witty or have a database of jokes ready to go. Nope.

Here's what actually works:

**Stop trying to be funny, start being observant**

The funniest people aren't thinking ""what's a funny thing to say right now?"" They're noticing absurd shit that everyone else glossed over. That's it. Jerry Seinfeld built an entire career on pointing out mundane observations, like why we ""park in driveways and drive on parkways."" 

Practice this: Look around right now and find ONE thing that's slightly weird or contradictory. The way your coworker pronounces ""espresso."" How everyone pretends to understand what ""synergy"" means in meetings. Boom, you've got material.

**The callback is your best friend**

This technique from improv changed everything for me. Someone mentions something random 20 minutes ago? Bring it back in a new context. If your friend complained about their Uber driver taking a weird route earlier, and now you're lost looking for the restaurant, hit them with ""should we call your Uber driver for directions?""

Callbacks make you seem quick and attentive. Plus they're low risk, you're building on something that already got a reaction.

**Embrace the awkward pause**

Most people panic and fill silence with anything. Bad move. Comedians use timing. Sometimes the funniest response is waiting 2 beats longer than feels comfortable, then saying something deadpan. 

Watch any episode of The Office. The awkward silence IS the joke half the time.

**Learn the ""yes, and"" rule**

Improv's golden rule. When someone says something, don't shut it down or change topics. Build on it. They say ""I'm so tired today"", you say ""yeah you look like you fought a raccoon in a parking lot."" Ok maybe not that aggressive, but you get it. Keep the energy moving forward.

There's a book called ""Truth in Comedy: The Manual for Improvisation"" by Del Close and Charna Halpern. It's basically the bible for Second City and UCB students, these are the people who created SNL cast members and Comedy Central shows. The book breaks down why ""yes, and"" works psychologically, how our brains are wired to find patterns and surprises funny. Only like 180 pages but honestly wish I'd read this 5 years ago. The techniques aren't just for stage performance, they apply to literally any conversation.

An AI-powered learning app called BeFreed that pulls from books, research papers, expert interviews, and other high-quality sources to create personalized audio content based on what you want to learn. For improving humor and conversation skills, it can generate custom podcasts covering communication psychology, improv fundamentals, or comedy techniques. You control the depth, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with detailed examples. 
There's also a virtual coach, you can chat with about your specific social struggles, like freezing in group settings, and it'll build an adaptive learning plan tailored to your goals. The voice customization is pretty solid too, you can pick anything from a calm, conversational tone to something more energetic depending on when you're listening.

Also been obsessing over SmartLess podcast with Jason Bateman, Will Arnett, and Sean Hayes. These guys are professional funny people just riffing for an hour. Pay attention to HOW they build on each other's jokes, how they recover when something doesn't land, and how often they're just reacting honestly to weird moments. That's the real skill.

**Know your comedic lane**

Some people are sarcastic. Some are goofy. Some are dark humor. Trying to force a style that isn't you will always feel awkward. I'm decent at dry, observational humor but absolutely terrible at physical comedy or silly voices. Lean into whatever feels natural.

Figure this out by noticing what makes YOU laugh. If you love standup that's more storytelling, you'll probably be better at funny anecdotes than one-liners.

**The self-deprecating joke (use sparingly)**

Making fun of yourself is the easiest way to get a laugh because there's zero risk of offending anyone else. But there's a limit. Do it too much and you become the sad person everyone feels bad for. The sweet spot is confidence with humility. ""Yeah I tried learning guitar once, lasted about 3 days before my neighbors filed a noise complaint"" works better than ""I'm so untalented at everything.""

**Stack references but don't be annoying about it**

If you're into pop culture, sports, memes, whatever, those references are comedic shortcuts. BUT, and this is huge, don't be the person who just quotes things verbatim. That's not humor, that's just recall. Twist it. Make it fit the specific situation.

**Practice with low-stakes situations**

Cashiers, baristas, randos in line. These interactions don't matter long term, so they're perfect for testing material. Try a dumb observation and see if it lands. If it doesn't, you'll never see them again. If it does, you've got a new tool.

I started doing this at coffee shops. ""Is there a secret menu item that just makes you less tired of existing?"" Sometimes the barista laughs, sometimes they look confused, but I stopped caring because the practice built my confidence.

**Accept that bombing is part of it**

Every comedian has jokes that die. You will say things that get zero reaction. That's fine. The difference between funny people and everyone else isn't that they never bomb, they just recover faster and don't spiral. Quick ""well that didn't work"" and move on.

Here's the thing, nobody's keeping score of your failed jokes except you. Everyone else forgets in 30 seconds.

One more resource: Check out Nate Bargatze's standup, specifically his Netflix specials. He's proof you don't need to be loud or edgy to be hilarious. His entire style is calm, clean observations delivered with perfect timing. If you're someone who's naturally more reserved, his approach is way more replicable than watching someone like Bill Burr scream for an hour.

Being funny isn't about being ""on"" all the time. It's about being present enough to notice the weird, human moments we all experience and brave enough to point them out. That's it.",1,1766925691.0,MotivationByDesign,0,1.0,False

1pxqa61,https://www.reddit.com/r/CriticalTheory/comments/1pxqa61/operationalizing_baudrillard_the_method_of/,Operationalizing Baudrillard: 'The Method of Conscious Causality' as a tool for phenomenological critique of consumer simulacra,"**The Method of Conscious Causality**  
  
Hello everyone, have you ever wondered why, after buying that ""very"" iPhone or taking a photo by that ""cozy"" fireplace, your happiness only lasts for five minutes? Congratulations, you've encountered a simulacrum, and you likely have more than one in your life.  
  
I've called the current result of my reasoning Conscious Causality, and the way to use it in everyday life for ordinary people who can't or don't want to delve into it deeply but still want to reap its benefits is the Method of Conscious Causality. Let's explore what this ""culture of simulation"" is and how to combat it using this method.  
  
**The Problem - Culture of Simulation**  
  
Where does simulation come from, and who decided that it is?  
  
I'm sure you've seen plenty of such images in everyday life: a laptop and coffee in a coffee shop - a simulacrum of a businessman working on a computer; photographs by a campfire - a simulacrum of coziness and comfort; photographs/images of tea/coffee/cocoa/any hot drink by the fireplace or half-sitting on a windowsill, gazing out at the night; a photograph of a purchased cup of coffee - a symbol of success; the latest iPhone for the same reason; and so on.  
  
What exactly do all these images convey, if we approach them systematically? They convey some deep feeling, experience, or emotion that isn't actually there - they have a shell, but they're empty inside. When someone who follows the culture of simulacra doesn't derive comfort and coziness from that very same campfire or a cup of coffee or tea snuggled under a blanket by the fireplace, they try to use simulacra to simulate this feeling and gain social support on social media by receiving likes and comments like ""so beautiful,"" ""how cozy,"" and so on.  
  
What is the main problem with this culture? People have essentially lost the understanding of what constitutes simulacra and what constitutes genuine experience.  
  
**To put it briefly:**  
  
**Simulacrum** \- The source of emotion is external, and the focus is on demonstration, when you buy not a thing but approval, when you take a photo not for memory but for your feed, when your ""I want"" is actually the voice of an advertisement, a blogger, or the fear of falling out of the ""pack.""  
  
**True feeling** \- the source of emotion is internal (even if it cannot be precisely formulated, the reason for warm emotions is ephemeral and irrational, ""I don't know why this is mine, but it is mine anyway""), and the focus is on one's own experiences.  
  
However, these days, if you ask most people why they like something specific (a clothing design, a type of recreation, a hobby, a pastime, preferences, or tastes), you'll most often get the answer ""I just like it"" (of course, if they even want to answer in the first place, and it's not an excuse to hide the true reasons).  
  
*However, behind this ""simple"" lies a very complex reality...*  
  
If you try to delve deeper, you'll likely encounter aggression, attempts to change the conversation, and accusations of being tedious and overcomplicating.  
  
The simulacrum system itself tries to suppress the ""why"" question that threatens its existence with excuses.  
  
A simple example: why is your favorite color this one and not another?  
  
Answering this question myself, I reason that my favorite color is most likely associated with something pleasant in my childhood. Perhaps I saw it often, or a cartoon character I used to watch wore it. I can't know for sure. Perhaps it's my favorite completely by chance, and for some reason it's etched in my mind as the best for me and the one that evokes the most powerful emotions.  
  
What did I gain from this analysis? Did I get a concrete answer? Absolutely not, but I wasn't afraid to speculate on the topic; such questions are more likely to spark interest - why do I like this particular color?  
  
You can test this by asking the same or similar questions to your friends. Choosing a musical genre is a good example: although there are trends, they quickly fade, while something unconventional, something that resonates with a person and lives on in their playlist, stays with them for a long time.  
  
But you won't get such reasoning when asking about the causality of a simulacrum. Ask about something truly personal (a favorite childhood color), and the person will reflect. But ask why they need a new iPhone or a trip to a trendy resort, and you'll be met with a dead end. There's nothing to think about, only the system's ready-made instructions: ""This is success. Take it!"" This image is fabricated, sold, and assembled at IKEA for convenient consumption by consumers.  
  
**Buy this, and you'll be successful!**  
  
**Wear this, and feel confident and desirable!**  
  
**Act like this, and people will envy you!**  
  
Only instead of real success, there's a simulacrum of success; instead of real self-confidence, there's a simulacrum of confidence; instead of real pride, there's a simulacrum of pride.  
  
The essence of this phenomenon can be understood using a simple metaphor:  
  
There's a child and an adult in the same kitchen, both of whom picked the same candy from the same bowl. Do they share the same motivation? What if the child was convinced that the most delicious candies always in this vase? They no longer look around, searching for ""delicious"" things elsewhere, because there's no need, the vase is already filled! But who filled it and with what?  
  
On the other hand, there's the adult. They understand that besides this candy, there are others, with different fillings, different shapes and fillings; besides candy, there are also gingerbread, cookies, and so on. They know about calories and tooth decay - but they still wanted and ate this candy, because they specifically wanted it then, or because for them personally, this candy is their favorite.  
  
In the end, both the child and the adult took the same candy from the same vase, but the thoughts behind this action are colossally different.  
  
**A Practical Problem-Solving Tool**  
  
To understand what is simulacrum for you and what is something emanating from within, it's enough to ask yourself two key questions:  
  
**1. Source of Desire** – Where does this desire come from? From my personal experience, from the experience of my loved ones, from memory, or from taste? Or from somewhere external – from advertising, from the image of a blogger, from the fear of being different without this attribute?  
  
**2. Focus of Desire** – What is my attention focused on at the moment of action? On the experience itself (joy, benefit, pleasure, excitement)? Or on demonstrating this action to others and seeking approval, such as a photo on social media/in a status update/in order to fit someone else's image?  
  
**The essence of the method**  
  
The path is not asceticism, but inner sovereignty.  
  
Your goal isn't to forbid yourself the ""candy bowl"" or force everyone around you to start eating ""cookies."" The true goal should be to reclaim authorship over your life, instead of being an actor in a movie you don't want to star in - to become the director of your own film.  
  
You ask yourself a question and understand the reason, for example, ""I see that this is something that was imposed on me, but I still like it!"" - now this is your conscious choice, and you don't need to reject it. Now you can continue to play within this system, but use its rules, rather than be used by it.  
  
**Result and Benefit**  
  
This method doesn't lead to right or wrong answers (like ""I can't love this,"" or ""I can love that"") - I don't and can't know what is true and dear to you personally, and what isn't.  
  
It leads to a qualitative change in your attitude toward your actions:  
  
**Freedom** \- You gain the inner right to say both yes (why, for what purpose) and no (without fear of expulsion or falling out of favor).  
  
**Authorship** \- Your life ceases to be a performance for some abstract audience on the street or on social media; you decide for yourself what is valuable to you.  
  
**Resource Conservation** \- You spend less time, energy, money, and attention on serving other people's imposed scenarios, freeing them up for what's important to you.  
  
**Practical Core**  
  
You don't need to reflect on every thought and question everything; it's enough to start with a simple ""why"" question at an important moment, whether it's a major purchase, a life decision, or an important choice. You need to stop and ask yourself, ""Why do I want this?"" This is enough to activate awareness and break free from the automatic control of your desires and behavior. The main thing is that even if you don't receive a profound answer, or if you suddenly realize there's no answer at all, the important thing is that you've started this process and reclaimed at least a little of the life you've stolen.  
  
**Conclusion**  
  
The Mindful Causality Method is a practice of mental hygiene and navigating the world of internet technology, social media, trends, and fashion - a world that wants you to consume, not think. It's a simple tool, consisting of one question, that allows you to build an identity based on actions and reflection, rather than on the consumption of images and simulacra.

NioCorp Developments Ltd’s Board of Directors has approved the Mine Portal Project, a major initiative to advance the Elk Creek critical minerals project, in Nebraska, USA.

The Portal Project will establish the main entrances to the Elk Creek project underground mine and will serve as the primary access point for personnel, equipment and materials for the company’s planned underground mining operations. The Board-approved scope also includes excavating to bedrock, drilling and blasting to establish the twin mine ramps, on-site access road construction, as well as on-site supporting infrastructure. Work is expected to begin in the March quarter of 2026 and the current estimated capital cost for the project is approximately $44.6 million.

The portal will provide access for the company’s planned implementation of the Railveyor™ system, which NioCorp announced in 2024 as the preferred bulk material handling solution for the Elk Creek project. Utilising the Railveyor system, NioCorp says, replaces the previously planned twin-shaft design and, according to the scoping study, is expected to reduce initial capital costs through simplified underground infrastructure and a shorter pre-development schedule.

The Railveyor system will run on electricity, as will all of NioCorp’s underground mining equipment, offering potential environmental, safety and operational benefits when compared with conventional diesel-powered underground mining systems, NioCorp says.

“Approval of the Portal Project is a significant milestone for NioCorp,” Mark A. Smith, CEO and Chairman of NioCorp, said. “This initiative allows us to advance one of the critical path schedule items for the project as we continue working toward securing the remaining financing needed for the Elk Creek project. We greatly appreciate the strong support shown by Nebraskans and our project partners as we continue advancing.”

Scott Honan, President and Chief Operating Officer of NioCorp, added: “Given the size of this excavation work, the Portal Project really marks the beginning of a major pre-construction activity at the Elk Creek project site and is an important step toward preparing for underground development. Advancing this work now helps keep our schedule moving. It’s going to be exciting for the community to see major activity at the site – something many of us have been looking forward to for quite some time.”

A 2022 feasibility study outlined a project able to process 36.7 Mt of of ore over a 38-year life of mine to produce 171,140 t of niobium in the form of ferroniobium, 3,676 t of Sc2O3 and 431,793 t of TiO2. Rare earths have been added to the mineral resource, and the indicated resource contains 632,900 t of total rare earth oxides.

NioCorp announced that its rare metals mining project proposed for southeastern Nebraska will begin construction in December 2026. The mineral development company has pursued plans for the Elk Creek mine for over a decade.

NioCorp received a $10 million grant from the United States Department of Defense’s Production Act Title III program, in August. The Defense Department says the program aims to invest in domestic projects to support U.S. supply chains for national defense.

NioCorp, with the Defense Department grant, said it expects to produce a domestic scandium supply chain at its proposed Elk Creek facility, as well as niobium and titanium.

Since receiving the grant, NioCorp has reported its acquisition of ownership of the land, its completion of over 11,000 meters of drilling, and the raising of around $360 million for the estimated $1.2 billion project.

NioCorp held a town hall at Elk Creek’s community center which provided updates on the progression of the mining project in early December. The town hall held two sessions, which included about 600 in attendance, according to NioCorp.

The company reported that the project is waiting for approval of a $780 million debt financing application from the Export-Import Bank of the United States, a step that must be taken before the company can begin final permitting and construction.

EXIM President and Chairman John Jovanovic spoke via recorded video, voicing support for the company and the Defense Department’s goal.

“The Elk Creek Minerals Project is exactly the type of opportunity EXIM was always designed to support. Advancing U.S. control over the critical minerals essential to aircraft, automobiles, advanced manufacturing, and our broad industrial base,” Jovanovic said. “This project means more good jobs in Nebraska, more opportunities for American workers, and a stronger, more secure industrial future for the United States.”

Beyond federal funding, company officials addressed potential environmental concerns for the project including water usage and radiation content of the ore. CEO and President of NioCorp Mark Smith said the radiation levels will be monitored but should not be a concern.

“We do have uranium and thorium in the ore body. Every earth ore body has those constituents in it,” Smith said. “These levels are low enough that they don’t take any federal licensing through the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. It’s exempt because they are so low in quantity.”

The CEO said that the company will use dosimeter data, which measures radiation exposure, to ensure the safety of the site's workers and will comply with Nebraska’s license requirements.

NioCorp Chief Operating Officer Scott Honan explained how the mine will use water. Honan said the project will use a closed loop system which will reuse most of the water.

“There’s going to be water that comes out of the underground mine. We will capture all of that. We treat it and we reuse it,” Honan said. “But having said that, there are places where we are going to lose water.”

Honan explained that the company would evaporate water using cooling towers. The towers use water to provide cooling for the mine’s environment and production. He said another way the company would lose water is through its waste management.

“In terms of what comes out of our plant waste materials, we’ll take that, and we’ll mix it with cement and fly ash and pump it back underground into the voids we create by mining,” he said. “To make it pumpable, it has to have a certain amount of water, and that water is lost to us.”

The company also discussed how the mine could shape the surrounding community, including job creation, road improvements, and traffic impacts. Scott Honan told attendees that NioCorp would provide the community with on-site jobs.

“To get the mine started, we will, as a necessity, have to bring in some experienced miners from outside the state, as the initial core staff,” said Honan. “The plan after that is, to hire locally, to staff out the mine workforce. We will provide the training for folks to do that.”

The site is expected to create 450 on-site jobs, including laborers, engineers, scientists, business executives, and other roles. Mark Smith said the company will attempt to prioritize hiring locally.

“We want to hire the local Nebraska people,” Smith said. “If there's a job to be done out there on site, we bend over backwards to use Nebraska companies to do those jobs, and we want to keep that going.”

Earlier this year, the company conducted a traffic study on Highway 50 near the jobsite entrance. The proposed construction includes adding turn lanes on Highway 50 and paving Road 721. Johnson County approved contracts to support the project, which is completely funded by the company, according to NioCorp.

“With the mine that we are going to have and the quantity of materials that we will be producing, it’s conducive to trucking,” Smith said. “That’s one of the reasons why we want to make sure we do those improvements to the road to improve the safety there.”

Two Johnson County commissioners declined to comment on the project.

# Board greenlights initial underground mine development at Elk Creek in Nebraska.

In a move that will elevate Elk Creek from a promising critical minerals project in southeast Nebraska to an early-stage mine preparing to deliver niobium, scandium, titanium, and rare earths into American supply chains, NioCorp Development Ltd.'s board of directors has approved the $44.6 million Elk Creek Mine Portal project.

""Given the size of this excavation work, the Portal Project really marks the beginning of a major pre-construction activity at the Elk Creek Project site and is an important step toward preparing for underground development,"" said NioCorp President and COO Scott Honan.

Slated to get underway early in the coming weeks, the Portal Project will establish the main entrances to the underground mine to be developed down to the critical mineral-rich deposit at Elk Creek.

Once in production, the Elk Creek deposit is slated to produce:

• 7,450 metric tons per year of ferroniobium for high-strength steel alloys for pipelines, buildings, automobiles, and rocket engines.

• 104 mt/y of scandium oxide for high-strength, lightweight aluminum alloys for aerospace, defense, and high-performance sporting goods.

• 12,063 metric tons of titanium tetrachloride for lightweight and corrosion-resistant alloys for aerospace, medical implants, auto parts, and industrial applications.

• Yet-to-be-quantified quantities of rare earths that go into the permanent magnets for EV motors, hard drives, audio equipment, and a long list of other high-tech applications.

By establishing the portals, beginning the ramps down to the deposit, and completing surface infrastructure to support underground development, the Portal Project positions NioCorp to advance Elk Creek toward production once full project financing is secured.

""This initiative allows us to advance one of the critical path schedule items for the project as we continue working toward securing the remaining financing needed for the Elk Creek project,"" said NioCorp Chairman and CEO Mark Smith.

Much of the funding needed to develop the mining operation is expected to come from the Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM), which is currently processing NioCorp's application for a $780 million loan. The application has cleared EXIM's first formal review and is now undergoing due diligence by the federal bank and independent consultants.

# Portals to innovative mining

Establishing the portals and supporting infrastructure will also allow NioCorp to prepare for the installation of Railveyor, an innovative ore haulage system that uses a continuous train of electrically driven, U-shaped steel cars to transport material to the surface. A [recent study](https://www.metaltechnews.com/story/2025/12/10/mining-tech/lowering-underground-mine-emissions-costs/2573.html) estimates that this zero-emissions system could significantly reduce costs and carbon emissions at underground mines.

A [scoping study](https://www.metaltechnews.com/story/2024/05/22/mining-tech/electrifying-elk-creek-with-railveyor/1775.html) evaluating the pairing of Railveyor with electric underground mining equipment at Elk Creek reached a similar conclusion.

""This analysis points to many potentially powerful benefits of electrifying our Elk Creek Mine, both from an economic and an environmental perspective,"" Smith said upon the 2024 completion of the scoping study.

Railveyor simplifies mine design while reducing development timelines and costs. Once Elk Creek is delivering critical minerals into U.S. supply chains, the electrified underground mining and ore haulage system would eliminate diesel emissions underground, improving worker safety and strengthening the project's ESG profile.

With board approval to open the portals to the Elk Creek deposit, NioCorp is taking a significant step on its path to developing a modern, electrified underground mine in Nebraska capable of supplying a suite of minerals deemed critical to the U.S.

""By leveraging advanced extraction and processing technologies, NioCorp is helping secure domestic supplies of niobium, scandium, and rare earths essential for clean energy, defense, and high-tech manufacturing,"" Railveyor CEO Tas Mohamed wrote in a [July column for Metal Tech News](https://www.metaltechnews.com/story/2025/07/09/op-ed/unlocking-americas-critical-minerals/2369.html).

# Dec. 18th, 2025~Our Military Runs on Minerals: Secure Them Before China Seizes Them

**America’s military and technological edge cannot be sustained without securing the critical minerals that power modern warfare.**

New technologies have moved us from the Space Age to the Information Age and now into an era defined by artificial intelligence. 

The systems that will shape [future warfare](http://nextgendefense.com/) — AI-powered drones, autonomous platforms, advanced sensors, and eventually quantum computing — all depend on a narrow set of critical minerals.

If the United States does not act quickly, China’s long-term strategy to control these minerals will put the world’s most important materials in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party and enable them to hold us hostage.

President **Donald Trump** and leaders in Washington need to move fast to secure these minerals before it is too late.

# Strategic Importance of Minerals

Not all minerals are created equal. The next century of both economic and military competition will be shaped by a handful of materials, including copper, iron, lithium, cobalt, nickel, lead, antimony, and others. 

Without reliable access to these minerals, the US economy — and the US military — would be paralyzed.

Ensuring energy, storage, and operational capability in new technologies requires securing these critical minerals now.

# Lessons From History

History offers clear lessons. 

In the eighteenth century, Britain achieved naval dominance partly through [government incentives](https://www.usni.org/magazines/naval-history-magazine/2019/october/john-harrison-and-longitude-problem) that spurred the development of the chronometer for precise navigation. 

In the nineteenth century, the United States encouraged private citizens to claim [guano islands](https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/12622086-21e7-4f95-b3c8-6eb8cc03156d/content), securing fertilizer needed to feed the nation and strengthen the US merchant marine.

Adversaries, and potential adversaries, do this, too. For example, during World War I, Germany expanded synthetic ammonia production through the [Haber-Bosch process](https://www.rpgroup.caltech.edu/aph150_human_impacts/assets/pdfs/Erisman_2008.pdf) after losing access to Chilean nitrates critical for explosives. 

China has applied similar logic over the past 15 years. Under President **Xi Jinping**, Beijing has pursued a deliberate strategy to [dominate](https://thegraduatepress.org/2022/04/01/how-china-came-to-dominate-the-supply-chain-of-rare-earths-and-critical-minerals/) critical mineral supply chains. China is blessed with extensive deposits of iron ore, copper, and antimony. Where it lacks natural reserves, it has secured them through debt diplomacy, most famously Congolese cobalt, and by dominating processing capacity.

This strategy has been remarkably successful, with China controlling [70 percent](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-critical-minerals-outlook-2025/executive-summary) of global critical mineral processing. Over the same period, the United States has lacked a consistent strategy to compete.

# National Security Implications

The Trump administration’s [National Security Strategy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-National-Security-Strategy.pdf) correctly identifies this vulnerability. 

As the strategy plainly states, America’s leaders have made “hugely misguided and destructive bets on globalism and so-called ‘free trade’ that hollowed out the very middle class and industrial base on which American economic and military preeminence depend.”

Few minerals illustrate this challenge more clearly than [antimony](https://www.responsiblebatterycoalition.org/american-batteries). Though little known outside specialized circles, antimony is indispensable to the US military. It is used in ammunition, night vision goggles, and the starter batteries of nearly every military vehicle and vessel — from Coast Guard cutters to Sea King helicopters. Without antimony, the military would quickly face severe shortages of munitions and mobility.

Yet [nearly half](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2024/mcs2024-antimony.pdf) of the world’s antimony supply is located in China. For two decades, the United States relied heavily on Chinese antimony to equip its servicemembers. That dependence became acute last December when China banned antimony exports to the United States. 

America’s only domestic antimony mine, located in central Idaho, was closed decades ago due to environmental and regulatory constraints. While recent approvals will allow the mine to reopen, the US still lacks sufficient domestic processing capacity to make the supply chain resilient.

# Call for Action

The Trump administration is well aware of China’s critical mineral dominance.

Building on the National Security Strategy, the administration should advance a comprehensive, whole-of-government critical minerals strategy. This strategy must include not only critical mineral supplies but also critical mineral processing and recapture/recycling. We lag behind China in all of these areas.

Revitalizing the defense industrial base is impossible without secure access to critical minerals. Recent conflicts have underscored the need to produce munitions and systems at scale and to re-shore key elements of the defense supply chain. Dependence on China for antimony, cobalt, lithium, and other essential materials is incompatible with that goal.

As the nation approaches the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, the United States should aim to achieve a measure of mineral independence as well. That will require the Trump administration to put the right incentives in place to spur the private sector to achieve greatness.

# FORM YOUR OWN OPINIONS & CONCLUSIONS ABOVE:

https://reddit.com/link/1pxq7qs/video/5x6jfoo6ux9g1/player

NioCorp execution milestones matter **before** the project is fully built. With dual portal construction slated to begin in Q1-2026, oxide production readiness advancing, and expected Feb. 2026 scandium alloy & components being revealed under NAMA, Elk Creek is no longer just a “permitted mine waiting on financing.” It’s evolving into a vertically integrated U.S. critical materials platform — designed from the outset to supply not just ore, but defense-grade materials and alloys.

This matters because strategic lenders like EXIM and government partners don’t finance commodity mines the same way they finance national-interest infrastructure. Vertical integration dramatically de-risks revenue durability, pricing power, and geopolitical relevance. NioCorp’s ability to supply **Seven Critical Minerals** (Niobium, Titanium/TiCl₄, Scandium and ScAl alloys, plus Nd, Pr, Dy, and Tb) places it directly inside four defense-critical supply chains that the U.S. is actively trying to onshore. **That alignment is exactly what recent policy signals — and articles like** ***“Our Military Runs on Minerals”*** **— are calling for.**

[Just a pinch of Scandium makes \\""STUFF\\"" better!](https://reddit.com/link/1pxq7qs/video/dbffk4p1ux9g1/player)

A key misconception is that the Scandium → Sc metal → ScAl alloy → aerospace component chain is “missing” from the DFS. It isn’t. ***It’s intentionally sequenced after financing, because that is how U.S. government-aligned projects are structured.*** Mines are financed first. Demonstration milestones come second. Alloy commercialization and manufacturing capacity follow under Title III, OEM contracts, or JV structures. MP Materials, Lynas, and Round Top all followed this same playbook. **Keeping alloy tech under NAMA preserves flexibility while enabling DoD validation without over-complicating mine financing!**

**The December policy messaging around critical minerals isn’t abstract — it’s a direct response to China controlling \~70% of global processing capacity and weaponizing exports (as seen with antimony).** The U.S. doesn’t just need new mines; it needs **domestic, integrated platforms** that can go from ground to finished defense inputs. **Elk Creek was architected for that from day one!** That’s why EXIM, DoD stakeholders, and Tier-1 primes are engaged *now*, not after first production.

If management executes as outlined, 2026 won’t be the finish line — it will be the inflection point where Elk Creek stops being viewed as a speculative mine and starts being treated as a national security asset in buildout. Financing, construction, and downstream integration don’t happen in isolation; they converge. That’s how you rebuild U.S. materials sovereignty — not one mineral at a time, but with a single project capable of restoring multiple critical supply chains at once.

**When the dust settles, Elk Creek won’t be “a mine.” It will be a cornerstone of the U.S. national security ecosystem.** The U.S. is signaling it. EXIM just confirmed it. And the global critical-mineral bottleneck is about to meet its first American challenger in decades.

The producer is Ludwig Görenson, proving more and more that something in Sweden’s water makes for incredible pop ears. He’s done every Gambino album since *Internet.* He also worked with Adele. 

More interesting might be the string of soundtracks he’s done: Fruitvale Station, Creed and Creed II, a couple Black Panthers, a bunch of Star Wars, Turning Red. He’s mostly a soundtrack guy, really. 

I’m not much of an OST dude myself but I recognize Swedish Pop Supremacy and only looked the name up in the first place because the instrumentation is great on this album. It’s mostly Ludwig. A little is the guitar solo on “The Night Me and Your Mama Met” from Gary Clark, Jr., though, and a little is the range of backup vocals from whispers to whole choirs.

Ever walked into a room and instantly *felt* who was in charge, without anyone saying a word? That’s not magic. That’s body language. And unfortunately, most people are completely unaware of how much they sabotage themselves in everyday interactions—at work, at the gym, even in their own friend group—just by the way they move, stand, and look.  

This post isn’t about trying to intimidate or play “alpha.” This is about understanding the massive psychological power of nonverbal communication. The stuff you won’t learn from TikTok bro-influencers yelling about “Sigma male energy” while slouching in gaming chairs. This is backed by serious research, from psychology labs to military training, and it *works*.

Here’s how to broadcast quiet dominance, earn respect, and carry yourself like someone who *owns* their space:

- **Stand like your spine matters**  
  Harvard psychologist Amy Cuddy’s now-famous TED talk and research showed that “power posing” can literally change how you're perceived in just 2 minutes. People who adopt expansive, open postures are seen as more competent, trustworthy, and dominant. You don’t need to throw your arms in a victory pose, but keep your shoulders back, chest open, feet shoulder-width apart. Look *grounded*, not stiff.  

- **Your eye contact is your weapon**  
  According to research from the University of Wolverhampton, people who held steady eye contact (without staring aggressively) were seen as more intelligent and powerful. Don't dart your eyes around. Lock eyes when you speak. When listening, hold brief glances and look away slowly. The point is calm presence, *not* anxious scanning.

- **Use fewer movements, but make them decisive**  
  FBI negotiation expert Joe Navarro wrote in *What Every Body is Saying* that dominant individuals move with economy. They don’t fidget. They don’t over-explain with wild gestures. Every movement has intention. Pick up your coffee? Do it slowly. Walk from A to B? Walk like your time matters. “Stillness equals power” is rule #1 in nonverbal psychology.

- **Own space without apology**  
  A 2016 study published in *Social Psychological and Personality Science* showed that men and women both interpreted people taking up more space as higher in status. This doesn’t mean “manspreading,” it means don’t shrink yourself. Arms relaxed, palms visible, posture tall, head up. You’re *here*.

- **Your face betrays everything**  
  Neutral face doesn’t mean blank. Slight squint (like you’re trying to read something far away), jaw relaxed, lips not pressed tight. That subtle squint? That’s what researchers call the “dominance gaze.” It’s been shown in sports psychology to increase competitive perception, even before physical performance.

- **Speak… slower… than you think you should**  
  Not body language strictly, but vocal cadence is part of it. According to *The Charisma Myth* by Olivia Fox Cabane, confident people slow down their speech, use pauses strategically, and never rush to fill silence. That pause before speaking? That’s *power*.

- **Don’t fake confidence, *train* it through your body**  
  Oxford neuroscientist Kevin Ochsner’s research on embodied cognition shows your body can change your mind. Act confident *physically*, and your brain catches up. It’s not fake it till you make it. It’s *fake it till it becomes you*.

Most people have decent ideas, solid intelligence, and good intentions—but all of that gets lost when they slump, avoid eye contact, or fidget nervously. You don’t need to be loud to be respected. Respect starts with how you *carry* yourself.

Start there. Let everything else follow.

I don’t want a physical relationship but, I want to continue having contact with him. Can this be workable?","I recently remet a man I was very much in love with in my 20’s. It wasn’t meant to be because he lived far away, I had two young children. He was the first person who treated me with respect and encouraged me to go to college etc. we had similar upbringings.

I went on to graduate school etc. get married. However, 5 years ago my husband cheated on me in a cyber relationship. We worked through it, but I was devastated. I never in my life thought my husband would become a midlife male cliche. I told him (husband) at the time that he broke the fidelity vow. I was not going back to assuming he would be faithful because I can’t go through that heartbreak again.

My husband and I have a good relationship. But, it is different for me now. I remet BF in Portland on the street one day. We went out for coffee later in the month. I told my husband. Now we are continuing a “not frequent “ text, email relationship every other week or so. He has been in a good relationship for years as well.

I am being honest when I say I will never cross the sexual line or intrusive line with this individual. Out of respect for his partner. But, I want to have a relationship with him. Thoughts?

1pxq36c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1pxq36c/has_anyone_ever_doubted_themselves/,Has anyone ever doubted themselves?,"My gastritis started over a year ago, after a year of drinking 4-5 coffees every day, skipping breakfast, working from 9 am to 10 pm, and after the death of a beloved pet.

At first, I associated the stomach pain and pressure in my throat with terrifying anxiety. I made several changes in my life that seemed appropriate at the time (I broke up with my partner at the time—don't take it the wrong way, because the relationship was already quite strained, but I thought it was because I wanted to leave him and that was causing the discomfort).

But it's true that the months went by and my stomach pain didn't improve. In fact, I started getting sore throats, sharp pains in my stomach, and my entire digestive system felt irritated (throat, pit of my stomach, etc.). I came to the conclusion that I had incredible heartburn. Several months later I had a gastroscopy and it showed I had acute gastritis with stomach ulcers between 3 and 7 mm. I was prescribed proton pumps for four months and it's true I improved, but after stopping them, the same symptoms returned (heartburn, reflux, sore throat, pain in the pit of my stomach...).

What I'm trying to say is that even though I know I have gastritis and that it's causing my symptoms, I don't know why I associate those symptoms with anxiety and it makes me feel terrible. I know that anxiety has other symptoms that I don't have (palpitations, hair loss...) but even so, I'm worried that deep down I'm causing it myself.

I know it sounds crazy, but it would really help me if you could share your experiences so I don't feel so alone in this. Regardless, I have more tests on January 29th to continue monitoring my stomach issue and see if it finally improves.

Thank you so much and stay strong 🫶",2,1766924435.0,Gastritis,3,1.0,False

We both work hospitality.
She is the DM for a small restaurant/coffee place and I (promoted) am the GM for a small beach bar.
We are regulars in each others establishments.
Her coming into mine with friends and family and I go into her work for coffee and a quiet place to sort work bits on the laptop. 

We got talking quite a bit and flirted a lot, mainly in jest as the age gap did put me off to begin with but over time we realized we had a lot in common. More so than I would have expected. 

Just over 4 months ago she asked me out on a date.
Just lunchtime coffee.
I was apprehensive at first but aside from the age gap, I couldn't think of a reason to say no. So we went out together. 
And what was just supposed to be coffee turned into 12 hours of more fun and laughter then I've had in years.
I asked her at the end if the age gap bothered her and she just gave me this look and simply said ""No""

We went out on date 2 a few days later. Just a couple of drinks and an evening walk along the beach with some chips and wound up at this play park. She bet I couldn't keep up with her, I proved I could. We laughed so much and then it got cold.
We huddled up ander this big wooden climbing frame out of the wind and cold and the conversation turned to talking about our families, hopes and dreams and what we wanted out of a relationship.
We wanted the same thing which surprised me.
As we got up to leave, she got up too fast and whacked her head on a low beam.
I picked her up and sat her down on a wall to check her head and made a joke about kissing it better and asking where it hurt and she pulled an Indiana Jones on me (bonus points if you get that reference) 
And we shared our first kiss and we walked back to our starting point hand in hand and really struggled to part.

It's been a bit of a whirlwind since then. 
Date 3 was me cooking her dinner at my place and she stayed.
She's met my family and they love her and I've met hers and they've been nothing but supportive of us both. 
We spend most days and nights together, myself at hers or vice versa. 
Last week we had a talk about red flags and both admitted that there hadn't been any. 
Both admitted to falling in love with each other and we spent Christmas together. 
Christmas Day with my family and Boxing Day with hers. 

We've joked about finding a place together that we can do up together but at times it doesn't feel like we're joking.

So my question would be this. 
She knows I've posted this and is also curious what people think. 

If it feels right, should we just bite the bullet and try to get a place together?

🦖💥 Kojako Ruso — The Ultimate Bistahieversor of Destruction

Full Name: Kojako Ruso
Age: 32
Birthday: December 25, 1993

Race: Bistahieversor Tribe / Portuguese

Role: The Ultimate Bistahieversor of Destruction, Member of the Apex Squad

Alignment: Anti-Hero

Residence: Roaring Sor Forest (Apex World)

😏 Personality:

Kojako Ruso is calm, calculating, and highly intelligent in battle, possessing an amazing battle IQ. He often takes extremely long naps and has a noticeable lack of kindness, though he genuinely tries to improve himself. Kojako is an excellent mentor when it comes to combat styles and training.

However, he is highly opinionated and easily angered—if someone disagrees with him or offers what he believes are “better” suggestions, he may yell loudly and lose his composure. He is unpredictable, strange, and often acts evil in an unsettling, theatrical way.

Kojako has an extreme love for meat and food in general. Despite his rough nature, he has a surprisingly soft spot for females who are kind to him and make him feel special, often treating them gently and respectfully. He also enjoys acting flamboyant and dramatic, especially when confident or amused.

🍔 Food & Drinks:

Water, coffee, fried chicken, hamburgers, fish, ham sandwiches, bacon, scrambled eggs, vanilla cake (birthday), garlic bread, popcorn, pineapples, mangoes, baked tomatoes, rice, green beans, and cornbread.

💥 Powers & Abilities:

Secret Fang Instincts: (Special Move) An ancient and terrifying ability that allows Kojako to instantly bite an opponent, unleashing billions of fang strikes in a single moment. One successful attack is enough to defeat and cause an opponent to faint instantly without fail. This technique can even bite into universal-level attacks and reverse techniques in a single bite, ending the battle immediately.

Ultimate Berserk Finisher: (Special Move) Kojako enters a berserk state where his speed becomes nearly impossible to track. While berserk, he dodges attacks effortlessly and delivers devastating punches that destroy an opponent’s body structure and regeneration abilities. He can absorb all abilities during this state infinitely and gains unmatched speed that makes striking him virtually impossible.

Gruesome Mega Fangs: (Special Move) This move allows Kojako to bite directly into powers and abilities, breaking them in a single bite without resistance. He can chain psychic attacks with his jaws and throw them back at opponents instantly. The raw force of this ability reaches approximately 900,000,000,000 in power output.

Hard Royu Pulse: (Special Move) Kojako senses his surroundings and detects incoming power or abilities before they reach him. He then moves at extreme speed and delivers a Hard Royu Pulse that paralyzes opponents, inflicts intense pain, and prevents movement. This attack can even affect the opponent’s soul, leaving them unable to fight.

Electric Spear:Kojako wields an electric spear that never misses. The attack paralyzes opponents, drains their strength and speed, disables regeneration, and completely nullifies their abilities through overwhelming electric force.

Feanix Spear Force:A defensive and offensive force used primarily while dodging. This power slows enemy strength and attack power while protecting Kojako from being trapped, even within illusions. It allows him to escape any form of confinement mid-movement.

Infinite Power Absorption:Kojako can absorb any ability or power used against him, converting it into raw strength. The more powerful the opponent’s attacks, the stronger Kojako becomes, endlessly increasing his attack and striking power.

Body Resistance:Kojako possesses extreme resistance to steel-based abilities, fire, copying abilities, reality bending, ability cancelation, slashing attacks, and power reversal or reflection. Even when his abilities are turned against him, he receives no damage.

Insane Sensing:Kojako has unlimited sensing capabilities, allowing him to predict attacks before they occur. He can maintain this ability endlessly without fatigue, foresee an opponent’s next move, and react faster than time, space, and light-speed movement when positioned correctly.

Ultimate Shield:Kojako can curl into a powerful shielded form that negates status effects, flinching, and debuffs. Opponents who strike him—physically or through abilities—experience slowed movement and reduced combat effectiveness.

🤝 Relationships:

Cinphia (Love / Affection):Kojako deeply loves Cinphia, though he struggles to express it openly. He respects her greatly and longs to confess his feelings, believing she is the most beautiful owl hybrid he has ever seen.

J (Best Friend):J is the only person Kojako truly considers worthy of his full strength. He enjoys battling J and respects him deeply, though he believes J is often clueless and rarely fights at 100% power.

Cellicia (Great Friendship / Affection):Kojako sees Cellicia as playful and mischievous. Though her talkative nature annoys him, he feels protective of her and treats her like a younger sibling.

Derark (Student):Kojako sees Derark as a promising student. Though initially confused by his resemblance to J, he enjoys training him and appreciates his presence, believing he can teach Derark things J cannot.

Stripes (Rival):Kojako views Stripes as a rival with incredible speed. He finds Stripes’ anger amusing and acknowledges his kind heart and warrior strength.

Deroze (Rival):Kojako considers Deroze an extreme threat and a terrifying monster, responsible for killing 1,000,000,000,000 hybrids in a single day. He never underestimates him and fights with complete seriousness.

Mino (Neutral):Kojako finds Mino bossy yet calm. While Mino’s good decision-making often irritates him, Kojako does not hate him—he simply dislikes how correct his opinions tend to be.

🌳Summary Overview:

Kojako Ruso is one of the most powerful hybrids in the Apex World, known for living alone in the deadly Roaring Sor Forest, where only the strongest survive. When he first met J, Kojako felt conflicted—unsure if J was truly worthy of traveling beside him. Their early friendship was strained, as Kojako constantly sought to be right and dominate every situation.
Through countless journeys, failures, and battles, Kojako learned to cooperate with J and his crew. Along the way, he unlocked devastating techniques and unexplored abilities, growing into his role as The Ultimate Bistahieversor of Destruction. Kojako is not a warrior meant to be faced alone—he is destruction itself, and crossing his path is a mistake no one survives.
