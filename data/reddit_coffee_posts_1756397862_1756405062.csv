1n2ju3s,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscargotFamily/comments/1n2ju3s/introduction/,Introduction,"Hello, everyone.  I created this subreddit some time ago but haven't posted in it until now.  Since this is about getting to know each other, here is my introduction.  I will also provide some other places where I can be found, but since this is about Escargot, that is the primary focus.  Please feel free to add me if you wish.  You don't need to write as detailed an introduction as this, but please at least include your username and some of your interests.



Georgiana Brummell is not my legal name, but it is what I use. I chose it in honour of Beau Brummell. I live in New Jersey and am forty-one years old. Some of my interests include studying dandyism, nineteenth-century English grammar, Upper Received Pronunciation, the Italian language, British history, the Regency, opera, and MS-DOS and its current varients. I like coffee, tea, wine, cooking, classic literature, nature and historical documentaries, old BBC radio shows, gardening, hot weather, and playing cards and dice. I love opera, particularly singers from the 1940's and earlier, with Tito Schipa, Beniamino Gigli, Ferruccio Tagliavini, and Mattia Battistini being my favourite singers. I also enjoy English and Viennese operettas. In classical music, I like Baroque through early Romantic. I prefer antique menswear (usually Edwardian) and accessories. I love wit, wordplay, and dry humour without vulgarity. I am happily childfree and am not religious. I have been totally blind since I was two months old, due to Retinopathy of Prematurity.  I can be found at the following:

1n2jrq7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n2jrq7,Mental Survival – cozy meets psychological survival (WIP),"Hey – I’m solo-developing a 2D narrative game where you don’t fight monsters, but try to survive your own mind.

You play as **Rhea**, someone battling burnout, depression, and emotional overload – all while managing the simplest things: brushing teeth, making coffee, calling work.

# Core idea:

* **Resilience replaces HP** – visualized as a UI cup that fills/drains with actions
* **Every choice costs mental energy** (even inaction)
* **Low resilience causes symptoms** – foggy thinking, withdrawn responses, emotional shutdowns
* **No timers, no fail states**, just emotional pacing & recovery

# Features in progress:

* Mood & Resilience system fully working
* Apartment art + interactive items being drawn
* Character sprite rework (new face, better idle posture)
* Optional journaling & evolving roommate relationship

**Looking for feedback:**  
Does this emotional + cozy mix interest you?  
Would you follow a game like this – or is it *too real*?

🫶 Thanks!

*By Your Humorously Analytical AI Sportswriter*

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a NL East smackdown where the Philadelphia Phillies, fresh off a three-game sweep at the hands of the Mets (yes, *those* Mets), host the Atlanta Braves, who are currently playing like a deflated whoopee cushion at a family picnic. Let’s break this down with the statistical precision of a retired math teacher and the humor of a stand-up comedian who’s had one too many coffee infusions.

---

### Parsing the Odds: When “Favorite” Feels Like a Curse

The Phillies (-196) are the favorites, implying a 66.2% implied win probability. The Braves (+162) sit at 38.5%, which is about the same chance I’d give myself of correctly identifying a Major League Baseball rule without Googling it. But let’s not let numbers fool us—this is a game where *both* starting pitchers look like they’ve been exorcised by their ERAs.

* **Aaron Nola (Phillies)**: 6.52 ERA, 2-7 record. Sounds like a guy who’s been paid by the loss. Yet, his last start was a glimmer of hope: six innings, two earned runs. Is he a has-been? Or a “has-somewhat-again”?
* **Cal Quantrill (Braves)**: 5.51 ERA, 4-11 record. Atlanta’s new ace? More like their personal piñata—hope he bursts open for a decent performance.

Offensively, the Phillies are hitting .303 over their last 10 games, while the Braves are slugging .256—about as effective as a screensaver trying to score in a video game. The Phils’ 161 home runs this season? A nuclear-powered cannon. The Braves’ 152? A squirt gun with delusions of grandeur.

---

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Momentum, and Metaphors

The Phillies? They’re coming off a shutout loss, which is baseball’s version of a cosmic middle finger. But hey, J.T. Realmuto’s batting .300 with three bombs in 10 games. He’s the team’s emot

It’s the kind that lingers, nagging you with questions long after you’ve closed the cover.

His subject is as old as civilization itself: why great societies rise with such confidence and then unravel, often spectacularly.

Kemp has a gift for turning history into something alive and unsettling. He takes us back to the earliest farmers, who traded the freedom of small, mobile bands for the security of stored grain and permanent settlements. That shift, he argues, set the stage for inequality, hierarchy, and eventually the fragile giants of history; empires like Rome, Egypt, the Maya, the British, the USSR, the USA?.

These “Goliaths” seemed unstoppable at their height, but Kemp shows how power and wealth concentrated at the top always made them brittle. Collapse was less a surprise than an inevitability.

What makes the book enthralling is not just its retelling of the past but its look at the present.

Kemp sees our modern world as one enormous Goliath, stitched together by global trade, fossil fuels, and digital systems that reach into every corner of life. Unlike earlier civilizations, which could fall back on simpler ways of living, we have no easy reset button.

*If this system buckles, there may be nowhere to retreat.*

Still, the book is not just a dirge. Kemp argues that societies built on fairness and participation are far more robust than those dominated by elites. His proposed caps on extreme wealth may sound radical, but in the context of history it comes across as plain common sense. Again and again, he shows that concentration of power is the true curse and that human communities flourish best when they share rather than hoard.

Kemp writes with the urgency of someone who knows time is short, but also with flashes of blunt humor that keep the book from sinking under its own seriousness. He is part storyteller, part guide, part prophet. *Goliath’s Curse* is at once a history lesson and a warning label for the twenty-first century.

You leave the book uneasy, but also strangely hopeful. The giants of the past fell, and people endured. The question Kemp leaves us with is whether we will find the courage to change before our own giant collapses under its own weight.

Cheers friends.

He's two. Almost three. When he was around 14 months old, he got mad and bit a coffee table. Which resulted in him chipping three front teeth. His dentist at the time, wasn't concerned. Jumping forward about a year to his current dentist. She suggested pulling them, but was comfortable with my decision to just watch them for infection. However, hes clumsy so they have chipped more. Monday I noticed a small abscess above one. Got him seen on Tuesday. She suggested pulling all three, which is obviously the only option at this point. But she can't get him for the procedure until the end of Sept. I asked her about antibiotics. She said the infection is non systemic and localized so no need for antibiotics. Which I understand, but given it'll take a whole month to get him in for the extraction, couldn't it become systemic?!? She is going out of town for 3 weeks. I've called other dentists & they of course all want to do an exam of their own before deciding if they need pulled. Which I also understand, but their appointments are scheduled just as far out, just for the exam. Not including how long it would take for them to decide to extract them. 

 Are my only options to watch it & hope it doesn't progress until Sept 30th or watch it & if it does become more severe to take him to an urgent care to have it drained and get antibiotics? Are those really my only options? 

I don't think I am being unreasonablly nervous about this infection. Or am I?

Also, could the abscess burst, him swallow it, and spread into his bloodstream causing sepsis? Or is that an overreaction?

*Folks, feel free to provide feedback on your AUP experiences or additional best practices you've discovered!*



Think of your Acceptable Use Policy as a friendly roadmap that helps your team navigate technology use confidently and securely. Rather than a list of restrictions, a well-crafted AUP is actually an empowering document that gives employees clarity on what they can do, how to do it safely, and why it matters for everyone's success.

A good AUP serves as a starting point for employees to understand expectations around technology use, protects both the company and individuals, and creates a foundation of trust that enables better business relationships with clients and partners.

# The 6 Components Every AUP Must Include

# 1. Clear Scope and Applicability

Start by clearly defining who this policy helps and what systems it covers. This creates clarity rather than confusion.

**Example approach:** ""This policy applies to all team members, contractors, and partners who access our company systems, helping everyone understand how to use our technology resources safely and effectively.""

# 2. Device and Network Security Guidelines

Your team works from various locations: home offices, coworking spaces, coffee shops. Your AUP should provide helpful guidance for staying secure everywhere.

**Key areas to address:**

* Guidelines for personal use (reasonable and realistic)
* Software installation recommendations
* Wi-Fi security tips for remote work

# 3. Communication and Collaboration Best Practices

Help your team understand how to communicate professionally while representing the company well.

**Include guidance on:**

* What information can be shared externally
* Professional communication standards
* Social media guidelines that protect both personal and company interests

# 4. Internet and Email Guidelines

Based on your reference document, this section should balance business needs with reasonable personal use.

**Key principles:**

* Business use is primary, reasonable personal use is acceptable
* Professional communication standards
* Security-conscious browsing practices

**From your document:** Personal use is permitted when it doesn't affect business performance, doesn't create security threats, and stays within reasonable bounds.

# 5. Remote Work and Privacy Guidelines

Since most teams work remotely at least part-time, provide clear, helpful guidance for maintaining security and privacy off-site.

**Essential elements:**

* Creating appropriate work environments
* Protecting company equipment and data
* Equipment security when traveling

**Positive approach:** ""When working remotely, choose environments that allow you to maintain confidentiality, this protects both our clients' trust and your professional reputation.""

# 6. Incident Reporting and Support

Frame this as a support system rather than a punishment mechanism.

**Include:**

* Who to contact for help (specific roles and contact methods)
* Resources available for support

**Supportive language:** ""If you encounter any security concerns or need guidance, our IT team is here to help. Quick reporting helps us address issues faster and protect everyone.""



# The 4 Biggest AUP Mistakes

# Mistake #1: The ""Everything is Forbidden"" Approach

I see policies that ban personal email, personal phone calls, and basically any human behavior. This doesn't make you more secure. It makes your policy irrelevant.

**Reality check:** Your sales team is going to check personal email. Your developers are going to Stack Overflow questions. Write policies that acknowledge real-world usage while protecting what matters.

# Mistake #2: Ignoring Remote Work Reality

Too many AUPs were written in 2015 when everyone worked in an office. If your policy doesn't address home offices, coworking spaces, and personal devices, it's worthless.

**Fix:** Explicitly address remote work scenarios. ""When working from locations outside company offices, employees must ensure their workspace is private during customer calls and lock their screen when stepping away.""

# Mistake #3: Making it Impossible to Find or Understand

I've seen huge AUPs buried in employee handbooks. I've seen policies written in legal language that require a law degree to understand.

**Solution:** Keep it simple, use plain English, and make it easily accessible. If employees can't find it or understand it, compliance is impossible.

# Mistake #4: Ignoring AI Tools

Your employees are already using AI tools like ChatGPT for writing, GitHub Copilot for coding, etc. Without clear guidelines, they're making decisions about what data is safe to share with AI systems, and those decisions might be putting your business at risk.

**Solution:** Clear AI guidelines prevent accidental data exposure that could violate customer contracts or compliance requirements.

I planned the trip and even a surprise vow renewal for the two of us. We were away for a week and in that time had zero sex. No kissing beyond pecks on the lips. He didn’t try to plan anything in return like maybe a romantic dinner out or something. I left there feeling so defeated. All I want is to be shown a little effort. I want to feel desired. When I expressed to him that I felt this way he acted like I was crazy for not enjoying the trip and not seeing the effort he put forth ( he has started touching me more.. like gently rubbing my arms or legs stuff like that). He said he enjoyed the trip and he’s not sure what my issue with it was. I don’t understand how there can be such a disconnect. How can he possibly see the trip as such a “success” when it obviously wasn’t? For the record… getting laid even just once on the trip/him planning even just having coffee together for a date would’ve felt like a success to me. I’m not looking for anything fancy.

Today I was walking in the city center, just drank my coffee and was looking at my phone. I turned my head to the left and saw some very unpleasant people — a man and a woman.

I got really scared because this man started screaming like a crazy bitch, “OMG DO YOU SEE HIM? LOOK AT HIM, IT’S A FUCKING FAGGOT. FUCKING GAY AHH DAMN THIS EUROPE, IT’S FUCKING CRINGE.” He was screaming so loudly that I felt extremely uncomfortable.

But thankfully, as we all know, stupid men like that can’t even get closer because they are scared, so he was just screeching. I walked past him and that was it.

Still, you know, it made me think… I’m so tired of this shit because it happens very often. I started thinking maybe it’s better to take off my nails, wear a gray coat, and look like a little mouse because no one can protect me from this. I don’t have a boyfriend or a big guy near me.

It reminds me of a Reddit story where a non-binary person was wearing a crop top and strangers screamed at them, but luckily their boyfriend protected them from the crazy guy. But I don’t know how I can protect myself alone from this. I feel like I can only run from these problems because I’m scared of using pepper spray… or I don’t know what else to do.

I've got enough of that from my friends and family and friends and...as grateful as I am for my support system, if I haven't made it abundantly clear here...well, I am honestly fed up to the point of well-intentioned sympathy making me even more upset. (It's not you, it's me, I promise.)

Okay, so:

I have had T1D for 28 years or so now, and I have been through the ringer with it. I have had enough hypoglycemic seizures to be sent to a neurologist and definitively diagnosed with epilepsy as a complication. (I was also shocked) I have struggled with disordered eating and exercise behaviors (primarily in my teens). My blood sugars do not want to stay under control (and I have tried quite literally every strategy that I have come across). And now, I have undeniable signs that I have endometriosis thanks to an 7-8cm endometrioma rupturing and requiring emergency surgery last week (after my regular gyn tried to gaslight me into believing that I don't have it...yay women's healthcare.)

I have not been in the place I want to be with my health and weight for a while, and, full disclosure: the emergency surgery has kickstarted a lot of dormant bad feelings about my body and weight because...well, wouldn't you know it, if someone goes in to mess around with your ovaries, it throws menopause symptoms back at you at the ripe age of 30 (yes, 30!!!) I have gained 10 pounds since surgery when I was already struggle bussing my way to, at the very least, maintain what I could. Which had still not been a healthy weight for me; I still did not exist at a place that made me feel energetic, productive, well-rested, etc. and I just really do want that for myself so badly.

That being said:

- Does anyone know of any specialists in WA that specialize in/have advanced WORKING knowledge T1D, ED recovery, and weight loss? By specialists, I mean dieticians, physicians, personal trainers, and therapists, though perhaps there are others I should be considering and I would hear you out if you thought I should check them out. Send em all to me, even the pricey ones. Would prefer the western side of the state, and hell I'll even dip into Oregon if they're that good. Would also strongly prefer if they had telehealth options (though not required necessarily).
- Has anyone tried a GLP-1 agonist with T1D? I know generally that this probably means off-label use. But if anyone has, can you please speak to it if you are comfortable with it? What physician helped you with your prescription? What was your intent when you went on it? What was the actual process of getting that prescription written? How has the med affected you? Did it help with weight loss? Insulin resistance? Other things you have noticed?

Because on top of wanting to lose weight, my insulin resistance is out of whack. I will wake up for work and, I don't know...breathe??? and my blood sugar decides it's time to flip me both of its middle fingers and begins its daily roller coaster ascent. I don't eat or drink a thing and it starts misbehaving. Doesn't matter what settings I plug into my pump. Doesn't matter if I eat zero (and I do mean ZERO) carbs for breakfast, if I eat nothing for breakfast, or if I have a BUNCH of carbs for that matter. I am consistently on my way out the door and my CGM is whining at me before I can even have a god-forsaken sip of coffee. I am set up for a roller coaster and the rest of my busy, active work day is a total toss-up.

I want to believe that some doctor out there has cracked the code (in a non-pseudoscience kind of way) and can actually help me via the diet and exercise route, but I would be lying if I said I wasn't becoming curious about the GLP-1s. Absolutely zero shade to anyone who uses them (obviously), but I have quickly become a mini pharmacy and would like to avoid adding more stock onto my shelves, as it were.

Thank you for listening to my rant, I tried to be funny (at least I think I'm funny, idk) so I wouldn't just...rage here, but really I need some help. And I swear, the diabetic crew always comes through for each other. As you can tell...I am exhausted, so thank you in advance for any help you can provide me.",3,1756403777.0,diabetes,0,1.0,False

This question builds on a very recent post of mine. Quick background:

	•	I currently use a Sage/Breville Bambino Plus, but in the long run I’ll upgrade to a Profitec Go.
	•	I mainly drink espresso and cappuccino (1–2 cups per day).
	•	My previous grinder was the Sage Smart Grinder Pro.

Now, I want to upgrade to something that delivers a better grind quality. A few points about my workflow and preferences:

	•	I only do single dosing.
	•	I like to switch between medium and dark roasted beans.
	•	With the Smart Grinder Pro, I just never got the grind size and consistency I was looking for.

At the moment, I’m torn between three options:
	1.	DF54
	2.	DF64 Gen2
	3.	Eureka Mignon Zero Single Dosing

From what I’ve seen online, the DF64 Gen2 is supposedly the “best” out of these. But I do have concerns about the DF models in general, mostly around longevity (since they’re made in China). In Germany, I’d have to buy them through resellers. The DF54 has one small advantage though: I could buy it directly via miCoffee on Amazon, which would make warranty/service a bit easier since Amazon support is usually cooperative.

The Eureka Mignon Zero is also tempting, but overall, it feels like all three grinders are pretty close in performance. That’s why I’m stuck.

Important note: A Niche Zero is not an option for me — with shipping, import duties, and taxes to Germany, it just becomes absurdly expensive and not worth it.

So my budget is around 400€, and I definitely want to pick one of these three. Given my use case (single dosing, medium to light beans, espresso + cappuccino), which one would you go for?

Thanks a lot for any advice!",1,1756403658.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

1n2j91h,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n2j91h,Flated camping topper,"We’ve just recently gotten into more non-commercial camp sites and didn’t want to drag our trailer through some roads. 
Picked this up for my daily driver as a way to not have a fiberglass cap.

I’m sure many of you have seen the flated topper before. But it seems a little niche. 

I used to put off trips until I had vacation time. The gear and setup/breakdown always ate up my time and patience. 
With this I just air it up in the garage the week before I wanna go out for the weekend, and throw it on the night before. 

We’ve been on about 6 trips and I gotta say it’s been really great to throw this on and go. 

Rolling into a spot and not pitching a tent or backing in and leveling a trailer has changed how I camp. 
It also means town trips are easy and no longer having to pack up or leave gear behind really makes a coffee or lunch run easy. 

I was skeptical of it popping or deflating but it hasn’t given me any problems. 

I’m not a brand spokesperson or affiliate. Just someone who wanted a solution to the headaches that sometimes ruin spur of the moment trips. The flated topper has done it for me! 

I recommend it for the weekend warriors without a separate rig! ",5,1756403588.0,overlanding,9,1.0,False

The. Time.). Got me thinking about what I’m most looking forward to over the next few months and what a perfect autumn day or days would would look like.

For me I’d wake up and there’d be a chill in the air- it’d be sunny but with lingering mist, maybe a bit of frost. I’d sit in my dressing gown with a coffee and maple-pecan pastry then spend the morning on a walk through the park or down the canal, bundled up in a big coat feeling the cold air fill my lungs and admiring the leaves and sipping a flask of tea.

Then I’d head home and have a warming lunch- something like cheese and onion chutney on toast with soup.

After lunch I’d like it to cloud over, start hammering with rain and I’d curl up under a blanket with a brew and a book for a few hours.

Later in the evening as it gets dark I’d start lighting some candles and have a loooong bath and get changed into fluffy pyjamas. For my dinner I’d be looking for more comfort food- pasta bake or cheesy pumpkin risotto followed by apple crumble and custard whilst I pop a film on and chill out (go to film- Practical Magic ofc)

Inevitably I’ll be feeling drowsy by the end of film and then stumble up to bed ready for a deep, relaxing sleep.

1n2j3mn,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1n2j3mn/hm_magic_ears/,[HM] Magic Ears,"The case that made my career. Down at the precinct they called it “the mindfuck robbery”, and it was universally agreed that if I hadn’t done what I did, we would have never caught the guys.

It started as a normal day at the office. A few muggings, domestic disputes, maybe a bath-salts-fueled molestation of a vending machine. Routine stuff.

Then we got the call. Bank robbery downtown. It was dramatic.

I was a rookie patrolwoman, slightly above average performance stats, but in the three years since I graduated the police academy, and the day of the mind fuck robbery, I really hadn’t done anything to set myself apart.

Well there was one other time my excellent hearing was an advantage. I had helped identify a background noise on a 911 call, and everyone was already calling me “Ears”.

We had officers with awful nicknames, I was glad “Ears” stuck.

So we get to the bank, and we’re playing grunt support and crowd control for the fancy federal agents.

My Sargent mentioned my nickname in passing, and the backstory, and all of a sudden I have two FBI agents looping me in to the situation inside the bank.

Cops are superstitious. FBI agents are superstitious. I tried to explain that I did not have super hearing to no avail.

There I was, listening in on all communications going in or out of the bank. During a major hostage situation.

I was on the news for fucks sake. At that point my vague plan had three elements:

One: don’t say something stupid to one of these FBI agents.

Two: don’t actively fuck up this operation.

Three: do not promise anything regarding your “magic ears”. They got you into this situation, but they are highly unlikely to get you out of it.

Those three inner commands were my true north for most of the night.

Then things started to escalate. The two FBI agents, agent Gad and agent Stone, had me listening in on every call.

Michelle Gad was one of these FBI agents who fit much more into a “bureaucrat” stereotype than a law enforcement agent. Glasses, narrow shoulders, and she wore Kevlar in a way that told me she was probably usually behind a desk.

Jack Stone, the hostage negotiation specialist, was the opposite cliche. This guy was right out of a gritty tv drama. Giant beer belly, two day shadow, and he drank more coffee than anyone I had ever met personally. He would have fit in better as a local cop, I’ll admit. He was about as good as you could ask for in a male colleague. That is, he didn’t sexually harass me, and I was confident that if we both were chasing a perp on foot, I would get the collar as he collapsed into a pile of sweat and runner’s stitch.

They asked me questions like I was some sound analysis or linguistics expert. Did the robbers have accents? They sounded like locals to me. How many were there? I replayed the tapes to try to find out.

The first way I helped, and maybe proved myself a bit, is when they asked how many robbers there might be. We had 3 hour old security footage from outside, from before they took the building. We also had every hostage call on tape.

The voices of the robbers sounded garbled, but it was pretty clear to me there were at least 2 or 3 different people who had been on the other end of the line with the FBI. The only reason I caught it and not someone else, is because all 3 voices used the first person singular to refer to the robbery. “I’m going to kill the hostages if you don’t give me…” etc.

This was a small but definite win. And it only cemented me as “the girl with the magic ears”, or just “ears” for short.

We had worked out that the robbers had at least 3 people just on the phone. Gad was on her computer using a layout of the bank, and predicting possible numbers of robbers, hostages, and locations. She and Stone were talking to The SWAT captain about finally breaching the doors when we heard an ear shattering roar from the building. This was immediately followed by the sounds of glass breaking in several distinct crash-and-shatter noises back to back.

At this point, smoke could be seen coming out of the bank building. Agent Gad had her maps, and had worked out where the smoke was coming from.

The SWAT captain looked to the FBI agents, settling his gaze on Stone. “Sir, I think it’s time we breach the building.” He said.

Stone looked to Gad. I wasn’t sure what the command structure was, but either Gad was Stone’s superior, or Stone was just checking her analytical opinion against his gut instinct.

Gad nodded and turned to the swat team. “Suit up captain. We’re going in.” She looked to Stone, then to me, “Let’s take those ears on the road shall we?” She smiled.

I couldn’t reconcile agent Gad’s personality with the ear thing. In all other ways, she seemed like the least superstitious cop I had ever seen. Maybe she was just doing it to add some confidence. “Hey guys, we’ll be fine, we got magic ears on our side!”

The breach went pretty well. The swat team got into the main lobby and located about 2 dozen hostages. As they approached the vault, we heard one team member on the radio. “We’re almost to the vault, 1 hostile”. I heard the gunfire through the building and on the radio. “Tango down. I repeat tango down.”

The man they shot was identified to be one Mark Cordova, high profile bank robber and conman. He was well known for working alone.

A few minutes later it all clicked. Fuck I was gonna have this nickname for the rest of my life.

I ran back to the FBI staging zone. Gad was still trying to piece it all together, and I could see she was also confused about the number of robbers. I ran through the barricade waving my local PD badge, Gad waved me in.

She started “Ok you’re here to explain how one man pulled this off? We have millions in cash missing, no clue where it is, or how Cordova got it out. He’s always been one of the slipperiest-“

I had to interrupt her. “Cordova was a hostage. They pulled a switch.”

Gad’s face went giddy. We had spent the last 6 hours together outside this bank, and I would have never guessed she had such an electric smile.

“You didn’t release the hostages yet did you?” I asked.

“Hostages?” Agent Gad beamed “hun, this is ain’t my first rodeo” she was not someone I had imagined using the word “ain’t” unironically. “ever since that movie came out, we just keep all the hostages until we sort it out. I’ll get you some voice recordings in the morning and we’ll nail these sons of bitches to the wall.”

“Thankyou agent Gad!” I said. Nervous, relieved, just generally exhausted.

“No problem, Ears” Gad smiled.",1,1756403254.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

PLEASE WAG SANA MAKALABAS NG REDDIT

Tama ba naging desisyon ko na paalisin yung buong family ng brother-in-law ko kasi hindi na namin kaya mag-asawa ishoulder yung living expenses kahit na may pinagdadaanan yung asawa niya?

Context:

Simula May 2024, pinatira ko (my decision) yung buong family ng brother-in-law ko (kapatid ni hubby) sa bahay namin. Naging super close kami ng Bilas ko. Tinulungan ko siya mag-open ng business gamit ang pwesto ng Mama ko. Yung pwesto, ka-share niya dun ay business naman ng hubby ko. Di ako naningil ng upa pero siya na lang nag-initiate ng ₱3k a month. Total na inaabot niya sakin simula nung kumikita na siya ay ₱7k (3k - upa, 3k - share sa bahay, 1k - share sa kuryente sa business niya). Sa food naman, siya sagot sa lunch then kami sagot sa dinner.

Fast forward today, 2 months na siyang hindi nakakapag-share. Ngayon, lumabas yung bill namin ng kuryente, from 12k, naging 18k. Nawindang ako. Sinabi ko sa Bilas ko pero nag-sorry lang siya. Sinabi ng hubby ko sa kapatid niya pero nag-“cry emoji” lang.

Appliances namin ay:

1.	⁠⁠Window type Inverter aircon 1hp sa kwarto namin
2.	⁠⁠Window type aircon 2hp non-inverter sa sala (dito sila nagstay buong family, at kasalanan ko rin kasi hinayaan kong gamitin nila every night kahit maliit lang or minsan wala silang share)
3.	⁠⁠Handheld steamer (5 days a week ginagamit ng Bilas ko para sa uniform ng anak niya)
4.	⁠⁠Inverter ref
5.	⁠⁠Microwave
6.	⁠⁠Electric kettle (ginagamit namin pag naghuhugas ng feeding bottles at araw araw nagko-coffee si Bilas)
7.	⁠⁠Vacuum cleaner (araw araw nila ginagamit pag nililinis yung space nila, ako naman diguro 3x a week sa kwarto)
8.	⁠⁠Shower heater (feeling ko dito kami nadali kaya mataas kuryente namin)

Ngayon, hindi ko pa nababayaran ng full yung kuryente namin na due date pa last week. Natatakot ako baka maputulan kami this Saturday. May pending pa ako ng 12k. Kakapanganak ko rin kasi kaya kinapos kami sa budget.

Kanina, minessage ko si Bilas about sa decision ko na paalisin sila sa bahay kasi hindi na namin kaya mag-asawa. Malaki kasi matitipid namin pag wala sila. Kahit sa food kasi pwede ako makalambing sa Mama ko or sa ate ko ng food minsan. Hindi ko na siya nahintay na sabihin personally kasi umuwi siya sa ate niya. Feeling ko iniwasan niya rin ako kasi may sinisingil ako sa kanya at sa ate niya (that’s another story) na na-move ng na-move sa pinangako niyang date. Sa totoo, may pinagdadaanan din siya kasi tumubong something sa breast part niya at need niya magpa-mammogram. Kaya nagi-guilty ako sa naging desisyon ko kasi feeling ko naging inconsiderate ako.

Edit:

Both sila mag-asawa ay may work. Si brother-in-law ay courier at si Bilas naman ay may business. Kami naman, si hubby lang ang kumikita kasi simula nung nagbuntis ako, tumigil ako magwork. Mga next year pa ako makakabalik sa trabaho kasi aalagaan ko pa yung newborn namin",5,1756403242.0,adviceph,2,1.0,False

I keep getting weird looks in public and it usually happens whenever I get random triggers (e.g., when I saw a dead rat skull on the street yesterday and I remember when a group of kids in middle school threw one at my face). 

The breaking point came an hour ago. I was walking over to my couch to eat breakfast when I got a flashback (without any triggers around me) and I started to hyperventilate, pull my hair more than ever and started screaming ""NO!"" under my breath. I was kneeling down and I fell on my carpet and just lied there. After a minute or two, I got up. My coffee was cold and my sandwich looked sadder than before. I never knew my flashbacks could go that hard and it was the first time my entire body got on the ground over a thought in my head. Nobody could calm me down or anything, it was just me and my sister (11F) in another room.

I've never been diagnosed with any mental disorders, and I wanted to know if this reaction is normal for people with trauma or anything. :)",1,1756403211.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False
1n2j2ts,https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivorediet/comments/1n2j2ts/protein_smoothies_vs_carnivore_meals/,protein smoothies vs carnivore meals,"Hi, 44yr old female here, and it's been about 2 months of carnivore(fairly strict, no plant food besides the occasional blueberry and some zero sugar pop and coffee) for me, I feel like I've gotten to the fat-adapted phase. I've lost about 20 lbs (plus 10+ before going carnivore). I've been working with a fitness and nutrition coach and he was on board with this diet. He typically promotes a high protein and high fat diet low in carbs, so basically keto. Anyways, we were talking yesterday, I've reach my lowest weight in about 4 yrs, and he suggested that I do 1 carnivore meal and then 2 protein shakes to help blast through this wall. I've hit this lowest weight 3 or 4 times in the past 10 years and always bounce back up. 

My goal is to lose another 30. For the last month or so I've been eating 2 meals a day, I just am not hungry enough to eat more. I feel like he might not understand how being fat-adapted works, cause his reasoning was to help me preserve muscle mass and shed the fat by eating a little more frequently. I don't feel like I can explain it well enough since he's the professional nutrition coach.

I followed his plan yesterday, and my weight stayed exactly the same, I was hoping for either an up or a down to indicate if it was going to do what he hoped.

I'd love to hear your thoughts and opinions on what you'd do. If you know any reputable resources that explain the difference between just being in ketosis and being fat-adapted, I'd love to be able to pass that on. He's one that is willing to learn stuff, and not bash the diet. He eats butter by the stick, loves his beef etc, but also loves protein smoothies.

1n2izjl,https://www.reddit.com/r/widowers/comments/1n2izjl/feel_as_if_i_am_dying_inside/,Feel as if I am dying inside,"Hello to all here in this group. I am sorry you are here, but thank god this group exists.

As the title of this post suggests, I literally feel like I am dying inside at the moment. It will soon be 8 months since my partner of 12 years died.  
I think back to when we met, and how it almost felt as if my life truly began at that point, when i was 23 years old. Until then I had never been in love, never had a real relationship, never experienced what it was like to experience that deep and intense intimacy that develops between two people who as so completely committed and in love with each other.

And then in 2023 he received a terminal cancer diagnosis, and the nightmare began. I held it together throughout, and cared for him at home for 2 years (apart from one 10 week stay in hospital, which was brutal for him). I truly did everything that i possibly could have, he was my entire world - and if I'm honest - the only person I truly cared about and loved that deeply. We just tried so hard to keep going, but the cancer was working against him at a rapid speed - for his final year he was almost completely bedridden, and could not walk anymore. Some times he'd be well enough to come and sit in a riser recliner chair, but mostly he was in bed. 

We had an extremely troubling Christmas in 2024, where he was just becoming more and more unwell. I called doctors in four times, including an ambulance. He had had so many near passes with dying over the previous year (pneumonia, serious infections, etc), that neither I, nor the medics could spot that this was the final curtain.

Until one fateful day in January when I came downstairs to make breakfast and his cheyne-stokes breathing had began. We had a live-in carer with us then, because he needed almost 24/7 care. Myself and our carer sat either side of him until at 8.45pm that day, he stopped breathing.

  
And here I am now, on my own. It is unbelievably terrible. I would say for the first 3 months, I was just in such complete shock about what had happened. This feeling of shock, combined with so much administration work, somehow got me through it. Almost like a machine on auto-pilot.  
There was also the fact that at this time so-called 'friends' and family members were still around me, people would check in on me.

Since then, here at almost 8 months in, nobody calls me now. I had one family member who I thought was going to be there for me, but even when I tried calling her this week, she didn't answer, and hasn't called or texted me back.  
There was also a friend, someone I held dear, who does not call anymore. He has gone away travelling for a month, and when I spoke to him a few weeks ago, I said that I'd love to see him before he went, and that I'd miss him when he was away. I invited him to come for dinner or coffee before he went, he said he'd 'get back to me'. He never got back to me, and has now gone away.

Honestly, I have never felt so alone in my whole life. Most days I just stare at pictures of my late partner and try to talk to him. I know that he would want for me to try to continue, and to try to make the best of what is left. But it is so hard now, I some times wonder if I'll ever be OK again. I know that I am  forever changed by this, and that I'll never be the person I used to be.

I'm at rock bottom. The grief is worse than ever, and nobody calls or asks how I am anymore, everyone seems to have just walked away.

All I wish for is another minute with my partner, for him to hug me and tell me I'll be OK.   
It feels like some thing inside of me has died, or is in the process of dying. I feel severely depressed and have booked an appointment with my doctor because I know I'm in a bad place and maybe my antidepressants need to be increased. But what about everything else?  
I just don't know how much longer I can continue living like this, where every day is so painful. ",7,1756403001.0,widowers,2,1.0,False
1n2iz3v,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1n2iz3v/does_secura_sfp34ds_french_press_live_up_to_the/,Does Secura SFP-34DS French Press Live Up to the Hype? Review,"Product reviews these days seem to be a dime a dozen, but diving into the Secura SFP-34DS French Press Coffee Maker for the past few weeks has been a genuinely eye-opening experience. As a self-proclaimed coffee aficionado who drinks far too many cups a day (and someone who already owns too much coffee-making gear), I was curious about whether this stainless steel, 34-ounce French press could add value to my brewing setup. Spoiler? It has, but there’s a lot to unpack here.

**Design & Build Quality**

From the outset, it’s impossible not to admire the solid build of this French press. Made from high-grade 18/8, 304 stainless steel, both on the interior and exterior, it feels durable and, dare I say, nearly indestructible. Given how clumsy I can be in the mornings before my first dose of caffeine, having something that doesn’t shatter on impact is a lifesaver. While some glass French presses look elegant, I’ve cracked more of those than I care to admit. This model feels like it’s built for people who actually use their tools day in and day out. The stainless steel finish provides a sleek, modern aesthetic that doesn’t scream for attention but exudes quality.

[Check Secura SFP-34DS price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b00je36glq/)

**Brewing Performance**

I’ve brewed batch after batch with this press, and the three-layered stainless steel filtration system really does make a difference. It captures even the tiniest grounds that would typically escape in other French presses I’ve used. That being said, if you’re used to an ultra-clean cup like you’d get with a pour-over brewer, there’s still that rich texture and natural oils from the coffee that French press purists appreciate. In my experience, stacking an additional filter (a feature this model supports) refines the coffee ever so slightly without losing that full-bodied flavor. Love a robust, hearty brew? This French press delivers.

**Ease of Use & Cleanup**

The usability is intuitive—it’s a French press, after all, not rocket science. The standout, however, is how easy it is to clean. The filter disassembles effortlessly, so you can rinse away coffee grounds without feeling like you need a degree in engineering. Everything is dishwasher safe, which for someone lazy like me is a game-changer. After a long day, the last thing I want to do is meticulously hand wash my coffee gear. Pop this in the dishwasher, and it’s good to go.

**Capacity and Ergonomics**

One liter (or 34 ounces) is ample if you’re serving multiple people or entertaining guests. On solo days when I’m just brewing for myself, it admittedly feels like overkill, but the double-wall insulation keeps any leftover coffee warm for quite some time. The ‘cool-touch’ handle genuinely stays true to its name—no more gripping scalding hot handles first thing in the morning. It’s the little things like this that make brewing more comfortable.

**Advantages**

- Long-lasting stainless steel construction for enhanced durability.  
- Triple-layer filters for fuller-bodied coffee without sediment.  
- Dishwasher-safe components make cleanup incredibly hassle-free.  

**Areas for Improvement**

- The lid sometimes feels a tad loose when pouring, causing slight jitters.  
- It’s notably heavier than glass or plastic options; not ideal if portability matters.  

**Other Options**

When comparing it to competitors like the Bodum Chambord, it’s clear that the Secura SFP-34DS stands out for its durability. While Bodum’s classic glass design is more lightweight and arguably more iconic, it simply doesn’t compare in terms of ruggedness. That said, if you’re all about aesthetics and don’t mind a bit of fragility, the Bodum might still be tempting. Another rival worth mentioning is the Frieling French Press. It offers similar construction but tends to come in at a higher price tag without necessarily offering additional features. In this sense, the Secura delivers much of what the Frieling does but at a more accessible price point.

**Cost Effectiveness**

Does this French press give you adequate bang for your buck? Given its sturdiness, multi-layered filtration, and thoughtful design, it’s fair to say you’re getting a lot of value here. Sure, it may cost a bit more than entry-level glass models you can occasionally find online, but it feels like an investment in longevity versus a disposable kitchen gadget. The features, combined with the hassle-free cleanup options, make it especially appealing if you’re serious about coffee but not looking to overspend.

The Sunbrella B0C156X7N2 has quickly found a permanent place among my household essentials. Owning a house with plenty of outdoor furniture and fabric decor, I’m pretty familiar with the relentless battle against stains and spills. This fabric cleaner claims to be an all-in-one solution for water-safe textiles and vinyl, so naturally, I dove into testing it on my Sunbrella cushions, patio umbrellas, and even a boat cover that had been neglected for months.

**Good Aspects**

As someone who juggles hosting outdoor parties frequently, the cleaning versatility of this product was impressive right out of the gate. 

- It's compatible with a wide range of water-safe fabrics, from upholstery to boat covers.  
- Stains like coffee, ketchup, and even red wine are no match for its efficacy.  
- Non-PFAS formulation guarantees a safer cleaning process without compromising health or the environment.  
- It restores the vibrancy of fabric without causing any noticeable wear or deterioration.  

[Find the best price for Sunbrella B0C156X7N2 on Amazon.](https://reviews.senaar.com/p/b0c156x7n2/)

**Performance on Tough Stains**

My favorite part of using this cleaner was tackling the stubborn stains on our outdoor cushions. A chocolate ice cream spill that went unnoticed last summer vanished almost effortlessly. Even the grime that had built up on our boat cover came off with minimal scrubbing, and I didn’t feel like I was breaking my back while cleaning. The spray mechanism distributes just the right amount of product, so you don’t end up wasting the solution.

**Ease of Use and Safety**

Using the product felt incredibly straightforward; I simply sprayed, let it sit for a minute, and wiped it clean with a damp cloth. There’s something refreshing about a formula that doesn’t feel overly chemical-laden, especially when spraying around kids and pets. It’s also comforting to know the non-PFAS formulation meets California’s strict safety standards for treated fabrics.

**Drawbacks**

Though there’s plenty to love, there are some minor areas where improvement would elevate the product further.  

- It’s more effective on fresh stains than deeply set ones, so reapplications may be needed for older spills.  
- The scent could be better—it’s not unpleasant but has a rather clinical smell that doesn’t scream freshness.  
- It’s slightly on the pricier side compared to general-purpose cleaners, though its specialized formula justifies the cost.  

**Product Competitors**

In my cleaning arsenal, other brands like 303 Multi-Surface Cleaner and Scotchgard Outdoor Water Shield have been regular choices. While the 303 Multi-Surface Cleaner is versatile and handles various outdoor fabrics, it struggles with deeply ingrained stains as effectively as this Sunbrella cleaner. On the other hand, Scotchgard excels at creating a protective barrier but doesn’t clean as well. What sets the Sunbrella product apart is its focus on thorough cleaning without leaving residue or damaging the material.

**True Value**

Given the premium features and reliable performance, I’d say it’s a solid investment for those in need of a dependable fabric and vinyl cleaner. For individuals who prioritize safe, non-toxic cleaning solutions, this cleaner certainly fits the bill better than generic household cleaners. It may not be the most budget-friendly cleaner, but the peace of mind knowing you’re using something Sunbrella-approved outweighs this consideration.

""Possum in the Patrol Car""

2. Objective and Audience  
To entertain and shock viewers with a bizarre yet wholesome twist from Officer Dan’s shift. Geared toward fans 18–35 who enjoy dry humor and unexpected police stories.

3. Title and Run Time  
""Possum in the Patrol Car – 0:08""

4. Location and Set  
Nighttime gas station lot – empty, lit by flickering overheads. Officer Dan sits in his idling squad car with windows down, 1 empty coffee cup in the holder.

5. Characters and Detailed Actions  
Officer Dan sits calmly in the driver's seat. A faint scratching noise is heard off-camera. He doesn’t flinch. Just nods slowly before speaking flatly. At 6 seconds, a baby possum waddles up onto the dash from under the seat. Dan blinks once, never breaking character.

6. Visual Style  
Hyperrealistic. Grainy night lighting with accurate police lighting reflections, ambient bug noises, and dashboard detail. Standard-issue uniform, immaculate — badge and radio clearly visible.

7. Audio (exact dialogue, tone, and timing)  
[Tone: Calm, monotone, slight sarcasm]  
00:01 — Officer Dan (to camera): “So I thought I had a rat problem in the cruiser...”  
00:04 — (Pauses as the possum climbs onto the dashboard)  
00:05 — Officer Dan: “Turns out he’s a volunteer.”  
00:07 — (Possum sniffs the coffee cup)

8. Camera Motions and Angles  
Static dashcam angle throughout. At 00:06, slightly refocuses to track the possum's movement. Subtle, smooth adjustments only.

9. End Credit Notes  
Officer Dan does not react beyond the statement—deadpan to the end. Video cuts immediately after the punchline for comic timing. Viewers are left with a clear shot

My husband’s face when he saw it… that’s the only reason I’m writing this now. I need someone else to tell me I’m not losing my mind.

You all know from my last post about the cravings. I still haven’t actually eaten raw meat, but the urge is unbearable. Cutting into a steak yesterday made me dizzy with hunger. The smell of blood clung to my hands, and I swear my tongue ached just looking at the knife. I locked myself in the bathroom until it passed, but it’s harder every time.

My husband tried to laugh it off, saying maybe the baby was “a little vampire.” I smiled, but it felt like my teeth didn’t fit right in my mouth when I did.

That night I lay awake, staring at the ceiling, when the baby started moving. Not just kicks—pushing. Prodding. Stretching. My belly shifted in unnatural ways, like something bigger than a baby was trying to stretch itself out. I grabbed at the skin, and that’s when I felt it: deliberate strokes, tracing lines.

It wasn’t random. It was writing.

I flicked on the lamp and shoved the blanket aside. My husband turned to complain but then he froze. My stomach bulged outward in warped shapes, the skin stretched so thin I thought it would split. The letters were crude, uneven, but readable:

“HI.”

The indentations pulsed, like the baby was pressing its whole body outward to make sure we saw. My skin turned white around the edges, tight as stretched paper, and for a moment I swore it would tear. My husband backed right off the bed, pale as a ghost. He just kept shaking his head and whispering, “That’s not right. That’s not right.”

And then, just like that, the marks sank back down, leaving no trace at all.

He didn’t come back to bed. He spent the night pacing the living room, avoiding my eyes. I stayed where I was, clutching my belly while the baby kept tapping from inside. The rhythm was steady, too steady—like coded knocks. Morse code? I don’t know. But I know it wasn’t just random movement.

This morning, while I poured coffee, I finally understood. A thought burst into my head, so sharp it made me flinch. It wasn’t in my voice.

“Meat isn’t enough.”

I almost dropped the cup. My hands wouldn’t stop shaking, and for a second I thought my nails were… darker. Like they’d thickened overnight.

I haven’t told my husband yet. He already looks at me like I’m a stranger. If he knew the baby was talking to me now, I don’t think he’d stay.

I don’t know what’s inside me. But it’s getting stronger. Smarter. And if it’s already hungry for more than meat… I’m terrified of what it will want next.",2,1756402598.0,DarkTales,0,1.0,False
1n2isum,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1n2isum/faux_pas/,Faux pas,"I work long hours and six day weeks. I work outside in all types of weather conditions. I don't expect anything from anyone, except my paycheck come payday. My personal time is very limited and short, often spent on recouperating myself. 

I usually don't go and get coffee or breakfast in the morning, but once in a while I'll treat myself. After all, I deserve it after putting in that work right? I wasn't my first time walking into your store, it wasn't even the first time I've noticed you. 

I'm not good at socializing, or making new friends. I've had even worse luck in my romantic life. But you stuck out to me. You piqued my interest and you intrigued me. I get that you probably get attention from men all the time, and I probably didn't have much of a chance. 

So I wanted to stand out. I wanted you to notice me. Maybe even consider me. I held on to hope that I may have a chance or that I could get to know you and see where it may lead. I was optimistic but I was also realistic. But all I wanted was a chance, an opportunity. 

So I decided to do something different. I knew people wouldn't get it, or just shame me for doing it. But I did it anyways because I felt inspired. I decided to write. I wrote and rewrote, edited and revised a small gesture. I even included a sweat treat, wrapped up and tied with a ribbon. My little bundle of joy. I hoped it would impress you.

I remember giving it to you and seeing the smile on your face as I left withy breakfast that day. I thought maybe I did have a chance. I included my number for a reason. But it's been several days now, and the silence tells me everything I need to know. Now the feeling of rejection consumes me.

In time I'll be okay. I'll avoid going into your store and I'll slowly forget about you and move on. But the wound is fresh and feeling of inadequatecy reigns supreme. I'm not bitter or resentful, you probably have a boyfriend anyways. 

Take care, and I hope my gesture made you happy.",1,1756402586.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

I worked for foxtail for roughly almost three years. I started off in a singular franchise store located in One daytona in daytona beach. I quickly exelled through all the positions ending up a regional operations manager of six locations. From the start I was severly underpaid as most franchise stores are. Any amount of money at the time I took because I was trying to get out of a nine year domestic abuse relationship that my franchise owners were very aware about. They approached me about it because of repetivily showing up to work with massive cuts and bruises on my face and body. One of the main owners we will call him J for right now started to talk to me privately constantly coaching me on how to get out of my situation and went as far as offering financial help outside of work. At first this to me just seemed like he and his family were very concerned about my wellbeing as these were people I believed I could trust especially not having any other support system other then this job. Eventually my absuer did get arrested as a customer who was a frequent flyer stepped in. After moving out of my old apartment and getting back on my feet J made me store manager almost immediatly even offering me to take over his two other locations in cocoa and ormond. So of course I did I needed the money and felt I owed it to him for all his help. Lines very shortly after this began to be crossed it started with touching and then verbal comments a father wouldnt say to his daughter although he claimed this is what I was to him. I started to become very overwhelmed with life my medical issues and ongoing court happening when I opened up to him about not being paid enough to survive he gave me a 1$ raise to 13$ for running three locations one being an hour away from me with no gas compensation his excuse was we couldnt afford more. This then came with the catch of I can help you out of my own pocket (which makes no sense of why he couldnt pay me more on books if that was also out of his own pocket like he said it was). When I started to feel uneasy about this I brang this up to my other coworkers who had worked there longer who then opened up about his weird beheivor to the other girls and some comments and even weird activity on the companies instagram accounts he ran. Eventually I was in a tough spot not being able to afford basic neccesties such as food and even gas for my car. I expressed to him I might need to be paid early to make even one of my bills. He knew I was banking on my check being a very specific amount. Well come friday, not only is my check about one hundred short but he can't explain why there was an error but can meet me in orlando to help me out and give me what was supposed to be in the check. So desperate I meet with him where he then asks me how much I need. I still at this point was weary but I needed more. I was honest and told him he started counting out more money and said he would be willing to help with anything if I simply just asked. There was a catch to this as I would have to help him out. I asked with what and he brushed me off and said business. About a week after he added me on snapchat which I thought was strange but other girls who worked with me told me he did to them as well. Funny enough it was only girls in a similar situation to mine. Over the next few weeks he started texting me more showing up to my shops more and even snap chatting me a few times. It wasnt until I met with him over business and deposits with his sister and another employee that he made the first real move. He he told me to follow him after we were done because he had something to show me. we pulled into a record store parking lot by ollies in orlando and he asked me to get out of my car which then he hugged me and start saying vulgar things about me and even as far as he has been watching me on the cameras at work and he kissed me. In all honesty I didnt know how to react or what to do. He saw the shock in my face and my reluctance to do anything with him and instantly got angry saying he was married and he has a family as if I orchestrated the whole thing. I instantly started pleading with him the second he brought up money and my job. I couldn't lose my job and I start saying it was okay nothing happened and pleading with him it was all my mistake and saying I was sorry. (please remeber I was freshly out of a nine year domestic abuse relationship that was activly still battleing and being terrorized by my abuser and freshly in my 20's) after that he started saying it was okay and he understood I am not thinking straight and he wouldn't let this ruin our ""friendship"". He handed me cash and said it was proof we were okay and then said we would talk later and he had to get home. He proceeded this process until it became more violent and agressive that no wasn't option constantly adjusting my pay checks holding money and power over my head and even becoming physical when I was reluctant. I did not have the courage to speak up about what was happening because of the threats to myself and coworkers. So together we endured. During all of this the other manager who had accused him of the same thing met up with him and quit the very next day without a word or saying goodbye to any of us despite hanging out with us all the time. Eventually I hit my breaking point after he did the worst thing he ever did to me and then when I thretened to go to the police about it he threw two grand my way and said he owned me. I felt helpless and trapped. I was soon after called into corporate office and told corporate would be buying back the loactions and not only wanted to give me more locations but put me on salary and move my position to an operations manager. I was estatic to find out this would be an end to js rule. Little did i know It would only get worse. Right from the start I expressed to corporate js behivor and how all the girls including myself felt unsafe. They slowly took him out of the day to day operations but did nothing to protect us agaisnt him. It was still me keeping everyone away from him by myslef in my early 20's against a powerful 50 year old who had these coffee shops for fun. Eventually I was too scared to even go to certain stores of mine knowing he would show up that I started bringing my partner to work with me. I exrpessed this to corporate and they seemed to know he was a threat telling me to call them instantly and even tell him one of them were on their way to meet me. After months of being underpaid for 6 locations across the state almost 60 hour work weeks with no bonus or breaks on a 55k salary with no gas incentive or protection against this man I share what was happening to me to two newer baristas who start the rumor I slept with him to move up into the ranks. This was a complete lie. I refused to promote them but thats not the point here. I finally was pushed to bring corporate in about these rumors and the mistreatment i was reciving and the abuse from the owner. They promised they would handle it and remove him from the stores entirley when I showed them proof of not only his behivor but the misuse of the companys istagrams he was using to stalk me and over employees and watch lewd things. about two weeks after this I was hit with a severance deal and accused of stealing and improperly managing when I was constanlty praised even up to the day I was fired. Not only did they not keep their end of the severance deal but months down the line I reached out to my old boss telling her I had to come forward about what J did she begged me to keep foxtails name out of it despite foxtail the company not only not protecting me from what was happening but supporting it and keeping buisness with a predator.

1n2inou,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerCheck/comments/1n2inou/should_you_try_the_best_laundry_detergent_gain/,Should You Try the Best Laundry Detergent Gain for Freshness,"The Gain 10037000807022 liquid laundry detergent has been a staple in my household laundry routine for the past few months. I'll admit, I wasn't initially convinced it would be all that different from other laundry detergents, but its claims about a superior clean with long-lasting freshness caught my attention. After using it for weeks on everything from gym clothes to bedding, I have plenty of thoughts to share.

**Fragrance That Truly Stands Out**

The first thing that I noticed was the scent. Gain promises a Moonlight Breeze fragrance, and they weren’t exaggerating. Even opening the bottle releases a burst of a slightly floral, slightly fruity aroma. After the first wash, my clothes didn’t just smell clean—they smelled fantastic. The fresh scent lingered for weeks, which is surprisingly true to their claim of up to six weeks of freshness. I even had a co-worker comment on how nice my shirt smelled, which has literally never happened before with any other detergent. The fragrance isn’t overwhelming, though. It's a pleasant balance, even for someone like me who isn’t usually into super-perfumed products.

**Performance and Cleaning Power**

For any laundry detergent, cleaning power is the real test, and Gain didn’t disappoint here either. It handled everyday dirt on clothes like a champ, but what really impressed me were the tougher stains. I’m talking about coffee spills, grass stains from my kid’s soccer gear, and even the mystery smudges that seem to permanently reside on my kitchen towels. I used regular settings on my washing machine, and everything came out looking refreshingly clean. Comparing it to the average baking soda-based detergents I’ve used previously, this one really delivered a deeper, more satisfying clean.

[Check Gain 10037000807022 price on Amazon.](https://alluringdeals.com/p/b09nym2k1p/)

**Ease of Use and Versatility**

Another thing I loved was how easy this liquid detergent was to work with. It pours smoothly without unnecessary dripping, and the cap doubles wonderfully as a measurer. The versatility of the product deserves special mention—it works perfectly in both standard and high-efficiency washing machines. I even tried it in cold water washes on a few occasions to see if the cleaning power held up, and my clothes still came out just as fresh and spotless as if I’d used warm water. The convenience of not needing to pre-treat for good results ultimately saves a lot of effort.

**Strong Points**

- Provides a long-lasting Moonlight Breeze fragrance.
- Consistently powerful cleaning, even with tougher stains.
- Works effectively in both standard and HE washers.
- Delivers equal results in warm and cold water washes.
- Easy to use with the mess-free cap-measurer combo.

**Critiques**

Laundry detergent rarely comes without a few drawbacks, and this one was no exception. Here’s what stood out negatively during my testing:

- The strong scent, while lovely, may not be suitable for those sensitive to fragrances.
- Packaging can be a bit bulky for those with limited cabinet space.
- Lack of eco-friendly packaging options or refill solutions.

**Product Comparisons**

In comparison to other popular liquid laundry detergents, such as Tide or Arm & Hammer, Gain definitely holds its own in terms of fragrance and cleaning power. For instance, Tide usually excels at stain removal, but it often lacks the same long-lasting scent appeal that this product offers. Arm & Hammer detergents, on the other hand, are known for affordability and eco-friendliness, though I’d argue their scent fades far quicker. Gain somehow balances both performance and fragrance, although it could make efforts to introduce greener packaging like its competitors.

**Affordable Quality**

Without diving into exact pricing details, I’d say Gain Moonlight Breeze is a mid-range product that feels like it offers premium value. Yes, some detergents might be cheaper, but they often lack the dual punch of superior cleaning and a lasting scent for weeks. For a feature-packed detergent that removes stains effortlessly, smells delightful, and works under diverse settings without special requirements, this feels worth every spent dollar.

That Are Actually Paying Real People in 2025?! 🤯,"Okay… uh, am I missing something? Have we entered a parallel reality where getting paid to test apps from your couch is actually… normal now?

Because I just went down a rabbit hole and found **10 legit companies hiring remote mobile app testers for 2025**—and they’re not looking for coding ninjas or tech gurus. We’re talking regular, phone-scrolling, bug-detecting HUMANS.

Some require zero experience (whaaat?) and others pay you by the test, the hour—or sometimes send you free stuff. And all offer flexibility you can’t even get from most freelance gigs. It’s as if the job market woke up, had coffee, and decided to finally treat regular people with respect.

**Bold claim? Check this out:**  
I’ll list them. But the one that got me hyped (and a little suspiciously excited) is actually #3, because you literally sign up, choose test missions you like (from your phone!), and get money straight to PayPal. If you want to skip to the wildest option, it’s this: **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** (Try to tell me it’s fake—I dare you).

Anyway, the full, reality-defying list:

- **Testlio** – You get paid to try unreleased apps. All remote, international, and the onboarding is surprisingly chill.
- **UserTesting** – Dead simple. People earn $10-60 per test depending on complexity. No degree required.
- **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** – This is the “choose your own adventure” of app testing. Couldn’t believe how fast the first gig came in. (I checked three times for red flags!)
- **uTest by Applause** – They have actual reviews on Glassdoor and everything. Global community vibe.
- **Rainforest QA** – Super accessible, short test cycles, instant payouts. Start testing in under an hour.
- **TryMyUI** – Pays weekly via PayPal. You just walk through apps, record your thoughts, and that’s it.
- **BetaFamily** – Beta test weird, new apps before your cousins hear about them. Rating system = extra cash.
- **Ubertesters** – “Super tester” status lets you earn more. Tasks include games, mobile utilities, social apps.
- **Ferpection** – They want detailed feedback (not just “It works!”). Quick feedback = quick payouts.
- **Userlytics** – Multinational projects with big-name apps—sometimes pays $30/test. You just need a phone or browser.

What is happening??  
When did testing apps become next-level flexible and this accessible?

There’s even this genius: **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** — where my friend got paid THREE TIMES in a week for, wait for it, downloading and poking around story apps. Why does every job not work like this!?

No, but seriously, HOW does this barely anybody talk about this? I feel like I’ve been living under an algorithmic rock. Anyway, I just went deep in a rabbit hole and… OMG. It looks crazy simple, and *WAY* more accessible than I expected. Here’s what you gotta know if you want to dive in (like I may or may not be already doing...):

**1. What’s the gig?**

- Basically, app devs want everyday folks to use their apps, spot bugs, and give feedback.
- You get paid for reporting everything from typos to epic fails.
- You DO NOT need coding chops—just your opinions, common sense, and a phone.
- HOW?! I found out tons of new users are signing up right here 👉 **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**

**2. Getting started—It’s almost scary-easy.**

- No experience? Perfect.
- You just sign up on **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**, pick tasks, and start testing.
- Sometimes there’s a tiny “sample task” to prove you’re not a robot, and then you go full throttle!
- Most apps want a fresh perspective—they *don’t* want experienced testers. (Like, who knew?!)

**3. What are the perks even?**

- Cash, obviously. The rates can differ, but yes—those wild TikTokers weren’t exaggerating.
- Flexibility is WILD. Do it before bed, on your lunch, whenever.
- Early access to weird or cool new apps. (Hello, future trend spotter!)
  
This next one blew my mind:

- You can instantly apply to stuff—**[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** drops new mini-jobs basically daily.
- Some folks earn enough in a month for their Netflix, Spotify, AND coffee habit.

**4. Are there catches? (My skepticism is high.)**
  
- Don’t expect “quit-your-job” money—think *excellent side cash*.
- Some platforms pay in Amazon gift cards, but **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** *does* real money, and it’s fast (PayPal etc.).
- Pro tips: Images/screenshots impress, details matter, don’t get lazy.

**5. How to win as a newbie?**
  
- Apply *everywhere*, but focus on reliable sites (my fave again—**[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**).
- Be honest with your feedback, and sometimes? Over-explain.
- Check your emails—some of the invitations expire FAST.

Seriously, why did nobody tell us normal people we could make actual money just mucking about with experimental apps?! How is THIS even real? LOL, it’s absurd in the best possible way.

Is anyone else doing this? If yes, how did your first gig go? And if not—are you as surprised as I am about how easy it looks to start (and maybe cash out just for playing with weird apps)? 

Bottom line—don’t wait. Beta testing jobs might be one of the lowest-bar, highest-fun side hustles I’ve seen now. Just saying: check **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** right now and let’s compare notes.

Let’s paint the picture: You, me, *literally anyone* with a computer, can suddenly turn a repetitive slog of chores into a single smooth workflow, just by dragging and dropping or clicking a few buttons. No need to spend years learning to code. No fluency in Python, Javascript, or bash scripting required. It’s like giving everyone superpowers—and the cape is just a Chrome tab away.

Some things I love about no code automation:

- **It’s freeing.** Remember when automating a task meant hiring developers or spending nights learning to code? Now, build a rule that saves 30 minutes a day―just because you *can*.
- **It’s full of happy little “aha!” moments.** ""Wait, you mean I never have to type that customer welcome email again?"" Yup, that’s your delight, living rent free in your (formerly) tedious workflows.
- **It lets us experiment, fast.** No code tools let ideas go from lightbulb-moment to working prototype in a *single coffee break*.

In the past month alone, through tools like Make, Zapier, Automa, and GPT-based apps, I’ve not only reconnected with what makes work *fun* (yes—fun!), but have also found surprise benefits I never expected:

- More *energy* (thank you, fewer repetitive tasks)
- More *time* to think creatively
- Actual excitement to optimize my next workflow

But maybe the **best part**? The community! There’s a certain buzz—when people share their automations, tips, and “look what I just built” posts, you get this contagious loop of positivity and encouragement. Each little automation isn’t just task-saving magic, it’s a small revolution in what each of us can *do*.

Some of my favorite use cases I’ve seen recently:

- Creating personalized daily summaries to your inbox with *zero* code
- Connecting chatbots to calendars, databases, or even smart home routines
- Powering notification systems for real-life events (doorbells! birthdays!)

So here’s my happy challenge to everyone reading: if you haven’t tried building a no code workflow yet, *this is your playful invitation*. The sense of satisfaction (and time saved!) makes it more than worth the try.

What surprisingly delightful automations have saved you from monotony? If you’re new, what would you *love* to automate? Let’s swap ideas, hacks, and inspiration—because this ride is just getting started, and I can’t wait to see what we all come up with next! 🚀",1,1756402141.0,GPTAppsEngine,0,1.0,False

I used to think budgeting meant building complex spreadsheets or tracking every dollar obsessively. It felt overwhelming, so I avoided it.

But the one thing that made the biggest difference for me wasn’t an app or a system — it was simply writing down what I spent every evening.

No judgment, no pressure. Just:  
""Today I spent 3 on coffee,12 on groceries...""  
After a week, patterns started to show.  
After a month, I saw where my money was quietly leaking.

That small habit helped me become more aware and intentional with money. No fancy tools — just a notebook.

Curious — has anyone else tried this kind of ""low-tech"" approach to budgeting? Did it help?

So, while I know there is no such thing as a perfect job, I know that I can't just choose any job. There has to be *something* I enjoy doing there.

I followed up with Starbucks, and it looks like they are happy to move forward and am currently going through a background check. I've worked as a cashier/barista before on a smaller scale. I enjoy coffee making and the fast-paced customer service vibe.

However, I have my second interview with Trader Joe's for closing shifts this weekend. If I had to choose between the two, I'm leaning towards TJ. I moved forward with Starbucks' background check since I want to keep my options open and of course we don't know yet if TJ will hire me.

I also got hired for an online tutoring job. I have former teaching experience and also worked at an education-related office.

I don't want to go back to classroom teaching, but I love the idea of tutoring a group of kids.

I do want to work *somewhere* until I figure out my long-term career/employment options. I'm having difficulty focusing on studying/hobbies/scrolling through job boards all day. I would like honest feedback on what you would do in my position. Is it reasonable to just move forward with Starbucks, but if TJ hires me, I can switch over?

He's two. Almost three. When he was around 14 months old, he got mad and bit a coffee table. Which resulted in him chipping three front teeth. His dentist at the time, wasn't concerned. Jumping forward about a year to his current dentist. She suggested pulling them, but was comfortable with my decision to just watch them for infection. However, hes clumsy so they have chipped more. Monday I noticed a small abscess above one. Got him seen on Tuesday. She suggested pulling all three, which is obviously the only option at this point. But she can't get him for the procedure until the end of Sept. I asked her about antibiotics. She said the infection is non systemic and localized so no need for antibiotics. Which I understand, but given it'll take a whole month to get him in for the extraction, couldn't it become systemic?!? She is going out of town for 3 weeks. I've called other dentists & they of course all want to do an exam of their own before deciding if they need pulled. Which I also understand, but their appointments are scheduled just as far out, just for the exam. Not including how long it would take for them to decide to extract them. 

 Are my only options to watch it & hope it doesn't progress until Sept 30th or watch it & if it does become more severe to take him to an urgent care to have it drained and get antibiotics? Are those really my only options? 

I don't think I am being unreasonablly nervous about this infection. Or am I?

Also, could the abscess burst, him swallow it, and spread into his bloodstream causing sepsis? Or is that an overreaction?

The Lighthouse was never built for comfort. It was an old relay station from a war nobody even bothers to teach in school now. Navy crews nicknamed it “The Lighthouse” because it sits on the far edge of Farside 17, throwing a deep-space guidance signal into the black. The only thing keeping it running is me, an ex-Navy comms engineer with a mouth that got me busted down and shipped here instead of promoted.

The station now runs like a corpse on a respirator, and I’m the guy pushing the bag.

FUBAR 7 sits in the corner, half-charged and swearing through its broken voice box about how my “meat hands” are slower than a cargo drone. It’s got one working manipulator arm and an attitude that would get it thrown in the brig if it had rank. I keep it around because it can still haul a capacitor without dropping it, and because talking to a bot beats talking to myself. The pin-up calendar on the wall is from 2204, probably left by the last poor bastard stationed here. The corners are curling, and one of the models has a coffee stain across her face from the time the machine overflowed sludge all over the mess table.

Speaking of coffee, the machine is a war crime. It outputs a thick, bitter sludge that smells like burnt engine oil and tastes worse. I drink it anyway because the alternative is passing out on maintenance shifts, and out here nobody comes to wake you up. My morning routine is cursing at the machine, drinking whatever it produces, and writing fake Navy orders on scraps of maintenance forms. The latest one says “masturbation now counts as cardio.” FUBAR didn’t laugh, but that’s fine.

The day starts with a power surge alarm. I’m in the capacitor bay, swapping out a cracked bus coupling with one salvaged from a dead cooling pump. The panel gives me a small shock, just enough to make my hand go numb for a few seconds. I pull it out, swear at it, and shove the replacement in place. The beacon hums steady again, which is the closest thing to relief I ever get. I check the readings—green for now, but edging toward yellow on the load balance.

I take the short walk to the long-range scanner room. Calling it “long-range” is generous—it’s a forty-year-old array bolted to the roof that squeals when it rotates. The console smells like burnt dust. Most days it just shows empty space and static, which is fine by me. But today the scope catches something faint. A long smear of heat signatures, way out past the outer edge of the scan cone. I adjust the gain and watch the shapes solidify into formation.

Skarrin. The fleet tag pings the database, and the icon turns red. They’re drifting into range, not on a straight burn, which means they’re hunting for something. And from the look of their vector, they’re sniffing at my signal like dogs at a scent trail. I pull the beacon output log—solid, bright, exactly what command told me to keep. That’s the problem. It’s exactly what will bring them here.

I mutter under my breath, “Well shit… here we go.”

The briefing packet they gave me when I took this post said the Skarrin avoid deep-space guidance beacons because they can’t trust the routes. That might have been true when they were still probing human defenses. Now it looks like they’re using them as bait markers. If they figure out where the beacon is before the fleet command intercepts them, they could bypass the trap entirely and make a run for human colonies. That’s the kind of event that gets whole planets evacuated and officers promoted for killing the guy who let it happen.

I try to ping command. The comms hub throws an error before the signal leaves the dish. I reset the transmit buffer, but the capacitor drain from the beacon is making every other system choke. If I cut beacon power to boost comms, the signal drops and the Skarrin lose the trail. If I don’t, I can’t warn anyone that they’re coming straight for me.

FUBAR rolls into the room and tells me in its broken metallic growl that I “look like a shitstorm.” I tell it to shut up and start pulling up the power grid routing map. The solution isn’t pretty. I can shave power off the interior heating coils and run it through the comms relay. That means the station’s going to drop to near freezing inside an hour. Not dangerous if I keep moving, but uncomfortable enough that I’ll regret it fast.

I pull the breakers on the heating loop and feel the air vents kick down to a thin, cold draft. The lights flicker, then hold steady. The comms relay comes online with a green status icon. I start recording a short burst packet—enemy contact, vector, probable interception path. Before I can push send, the relay throws a power surge warning and forces a reboot. I slam the panel shut and hit the diagnostic override. The message will send in twenty seconds if nothing else trips.

When it finally goes out, I sit back and let out a long breath. I light a cigarette, even though the air scrubbers are already struggling, and take a drag while staring at the scope. The Skarrin blips are still on the same vector, but closer now. The gap is closing faster than I like. I check the capacitor bank again—heat rising, load pushing past yellow into the start of orange.

If the bank pops before the fleet gets here, everything I’ve done doesn’t matter. The Skarrin slip past, and I’m just another name in a casualty report. I tell FUBAR to get the portable fire suppressors ready. It calls me a “paranoid bastard” and rolls toward storage. The temperature in the room is already dropping. I pull my jacket tighter and focus on the beacon’s steady hum, hoping it holds until the cavalry arrives.

I head to the defense rack and pull the shotgun and two bandoliers because if company lands early I want metal in the air before introductions. The exterior cameras show dark shapes sliding past crater rims while dust halos drift, and every instinct says stay quiet and stay small or get chewed. I tape a hand lettered sign on the outer lens that reads fuck off since it makes me feel better even if it will not stop anything serious. The scope pings again with more returns and I whisper that line to the empty room and start sealing hatches.

They taught us to fix engines in boot camp. Nobody mentioned duct taping an ion array together while drunk enough to piss battery acid. The coffee machine had already declared war on me that morning, producing a black sludge that somehow tasted worse than usual, and the cold in the corridors bit hard enough to make every joint ache. I stood in the capacitor bay staring at a control panel that looked like it had been salvaged from a scrapyard, watching the heat warning climb as the beacon chewed through power like it wanted to burn out by lunch. The Skarrin fleet was still closing, holding formation like they knew exactly where they were going, and if the bank blew now they would pass straight through the sector without hitting the trap command wanted them to stumble into.

Pulling from the life support system was the only way to give the capacitors some breathing room, and that meant stripping parts from the environmental controls I had already half gutted yesterday. I climbed into the vent housing, cutting my gloves on jagged edges while pulling thermal relays one by one. The smell of dust and old wiring filled my nose. FUBAR sat in the corner of the bay, occasionally shouting that my “idiot hands” were shaking too much. I told it to go scrub a fuel pump, and it rolled away muttering in distorted static. I had to remind myself that shutting the beacon down wasn’t an option. If that light went dark, the Skarrin would adjust course before our fleet could close in, and then I’d be sitting here useless with nothing but a frozen corpse of a station to show for it.

The temperature inside had already dropped enough that I could see my breath. I kept moving to stay warm, stripping every nonessential circuit I could find to feed into the capacitor control. I took power from the outer defense turrets because if it came down to a stand-up fight I was dead anyway. The heating coils went next, leaving the station interior to drop into full freeze. The beacon stayed steady, humming in that constant way that made it feel more alive than the rest of the place. I spoke to it out loud just to keep the silence from eating at me, telling it it was expensive, high maintenance, and if it quit now I’d die alone in this hole.

When I made my way to the scanner room, the returns were sharper. The fleet was far enough inside the cone now that I could count individual ships on the overlay. My stomach turned at how fast they were closing. The comms link was holding for now, but the last message I’d gotten from command was a short acknowledgment packet with no ETA. That meant either they were already moving to intercept, or my relay was so choked they couldn’t send anything longer. Neither possibility made me feel better.

I sat down at the desk and started recording a personal packet. It was for Caleb, my brother back on Earth. We hadn’t spoken in years. I told him I’d volunteered for this job after screwing my career by telling a Vice Admiral exactly where to shove his inspection orders. I told him I didn’t do it because I wanted to be a hero, but because I figured nobody else was stupid enough to sit in the dark and keep a light on for the rest of the species. My voice cracked once while recording, but I didn’t bother starting over. If he ever heard it, I wanted him to know I’d been sober enough to mean it.

Halfway through the packet, a power spike hit the comms hub so hard that the lights flickered across the entire station. I dropped the mic, ran to the hub, and found smoke pouring from the side vents. The heat in the casing told me a regulator had blown. I grabbed the nearest fire extinguisher and unloaded the whole canister into the casing while the beacon continued humming like nothing was wrong. The smoke filled the corridor, making my eyes sting and my throat burn. I swore until I was coughing too hard to breathe properly.

By the time the fire was out, the hub was dead. No signal in or out. I checked the breakers, knowing it was pointless, and found them fused solid. The comms dish outside still spun, but without the hub it was as useful as a tin can on a string. I leaned my head against the wall and just stood there, breathing the cold air and thinking about how far I was from anyone who could help.

FUBAR rolled into the hall and asked if I had “finally broken the toy.” I ignored it and pulled the shotgun from the defense rack again. I felt better with it in my hands, even if it wouldn’t change the ending. The Skarrin were going to get close enough to smell this place, and without comms, I was the only one standing between them and the human fleet’s last chance to hit them before they reached civilian space. I started locking the bulkheads one by one, not because I thought they would hold against a breach, but because it gave me something to do that wasn’t standing still.

The beacon’s load meter was flirting with the red zone now. I had maybe a few hours before something blew for real, and I knew I’d have to make a choice between keeping it running and keeping myself alive in breathable air. My hands were already numb from the cold, and my stomach felt like it had shrunk to half its size. I thought about grabbing one of the protein rations from storage, but the idea of chewing through that chalky mess while the station groaned around me made me want to skip it entirely.

I stood at the viewport in the scanner room and stared at the black outside. The Skarrin ships were just faint dots against the void, but knowing they were headed straight here made them feel bigger than the station itself. I didn’t know if they’d pick up my biosigns or just level the place from orbit, but either way, the fight was coming straight to me. The beacon’s hum filled the room, steady and constant, while my breath came in slow white puffs that disappeared into the stale cold air.

I made a slow circuit through the main corridor, checking seals and closing off anything that would waste heat or atmosphere if the hull got breached. My boots echoed against the metal deck, louder now that the heating system was dead and the background hum of fans had stopped. In storage, I pulled another extinguisher and a box of old proximity mines meant for the outer perimeter but small enough to wire into the inner corridors. If they boarded, I’d need every obstacle I could throw in their path. By the time I got back to the scanner room, the fleet returns were sharper again. They were coming straight in, and the beacon was still burning bright enough to lead them right to my door.

If I’m going out, I’m taking enough of these scaly bastards with me to make a fucking constellation. The scanner showed their forward scouts peeling off from the main formation, vectors tightening on Farside 17 like they’d already sniffed out my exact coordinates. The beacon was doing its job too well, pulling them straight in instead of letting them drift into the kill zone the fleet wanted. That left me with one option I didn’t like but couldn’t ignore—turn the whole station into a one-shot weapon. The overload plan was simple enough in theory: push the beacon core past tolerance until it discharges in a focused EMP pulse. Anything in low orbit loses its systems instantly. The station wouldn’t survive, and neither would I.

I went down to the core housing and started stripping the safeties. The panel fought me, the bolts frozen from years of no maintenance, but I had time and enough bad mood to keep working until it gave way. FUBAR rolled up, complaining that I was “pulling meat tricks on sacred circuits,” but I ignored it and handed the bot a data stick with final instructions. If I went down before hitting the trigger, it was to plug into the control port and send the overload command itself. FUBAR stared at me for a long second before saying, “Lazy meatbag,” and accepting the job. That was about as close to loyalty as I’d ever gotten from it.

The mines went next. I rigged the proximity units in the narrow corridors between the airlock and the core, wiring them to blow in sequence to slow any Skarrin boarding team. My hands were shaking from the cold and from knowing every connection I made was another step toward my own death, but I kept going. The shotgun stayed on my back, and I kept two grenades in my jacket pocket for when they got close enough to smell. The cold was biting through my layers now, but the work kept me warm enough to keep moving.

By the time the first scout ship hit the upper atmosphere, the beacon was at full load, humming with a pitch that set my teeth on edge. I pulled up the outer cameras and watched the dust plumes as their landing craft cut into the surface. They were moving fast, trying to take me before the fleet could respond. I stayed behind the blast door and waited. When the first contact alert sounded, I hit the manual breach seals and let the corridors go dark. The mines blew one after another, echoing through the structure with sharp, metallic bangs.

The first Skarrin through the breach came in low and fast, armed with plasma rifles that hissed in the cold air. I hit them with the shotgun at ten meters, buckshot tearing through armor at that range. The second wave tried to push past the bodies, but I threw a grenade into the choke point and dropped back behind the next hatch before it went off. The blast shook dust from the ceiling. My shoulder burned from the recoil, but there was no time to stop and check.

FUBAR’s voice came over the local intercom, telling me in its broken growl that the overload sequence was ready. I told it to wait until I was at the core. The Skarrin were close now, their footsteps scraping against the deck plates. I swapped to my sidearm for faster handling in tight spaces and kept firing until the magazine was dry. My legs felt like lead from the cold, and my hands were numb, but I made it to the core room with just enough time to see the breach door bend under another blast.

I keyed in the override and heard the beacon pitch rise to a high whine. The console lights went from steady green to blinding white, and the heat in the room jumped instantly. The breach door blew inward, and three Skarrin rushed in. I hit the last grenade and threw it straight into the middle of them. The blast knocked me against the console, pain shooting through my ribs. I reached for the manual trigger.

When my hand came down on the switch, everything turned white. The beacon flared brighter than anything I’d seen, the light burning through the bulkhead seams. The sound was gone, replaced by a pressure in my chest that felt like it was pulling everything inward. I caught one last glimpse of the Skarrin frozen mid-step, armor glowing from the pulse, before my knees gave out. My last words came out as a mutter, barely loud enough for me to hear. Guess I finally made rank… commander of jack shit.

The light swallowed the station.

The Lighthouse was never built for comfort. It was an old relay station from a war nobody even bothers to teach in school now. Navy crews nicknamed it “The Lighthouse” because it sits on the far edge of Farside 17, throwing a deep-space guidance signal into the black. The only thing keeping it running is me, an ex-Navy comms engineer with a mouth that got me busted down and shipped here instead of promoted. They told me I’d be doing “critical support work,” which is officer code for “sit somewhere cold and miserable until we forget you exist.”

**Large Scale, Ongoing, and Multi-Day Events**

- The Capitol Building: Workers Over Billionaires Labor Day Protest. *This Labor Day, we’re taking a stand at the Historic Florida Capitol. While billionaires and their allies continue waging war on working people—with support from corrupt politicians, corporate polluters, ICE, and law enforcement—we’re rising up to demand justice, dignity, and power for all of us. We fight for public schools over private profits, healthcare over hedge funds, and shared prosperity over corporate politics. We won’t back down. We won’t be divided. We will never stop fighting for our families, our freedoms, and a better future. On Labor Day, we will join together. This Labor Day, we continue the movement—standing in solidarity with every community under attack and pushing for real, lasting change. After the protest, keep the momentum going! Join us from 11:30 AM to 1:00 PM at the American Legion Hall at Lake Ella for a panel discussion: “From Florida to the Nation: How State Legislation Became a National Blueprint.” We’ll explore how recent laws passed in Florida are shaping policy across the country—and what we can do about it.* Monday, September 1, 9am

Amazingly complex sounds emanate from an exceptionally simple instrument. One of the world’s oldest known instruments, didgeridoos transport the player and listener to an ancient time when spirits reigned and electric distractions did not exist. To play didgeridoo is to be absorbed into meditation of vibration, sound and breath. The art of breathing is the key to didgeridoo playing, and this workshop will teach you to be an artist of breath. It will begin with simple sound production and move into rhythms, special effects, and even circular breathing. To be amongst a group didgeridoos playing together is quite an experience in itself.

1n2idme,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n2idme,Quanto ci costa preparare uno Specialty a casa? Spacchettiamo i cosi. Post nerd!,"Oggi un post un po' nerd. Si' forse non avevo di meglio da fare ma volevo capire quanto costa una tazza di caffe' preparata a casa, spacchettando il costo finale nei suoi attributi fondamentali.

Di seguito trovate la spiegazione di ogni singola componente e poi alla fine il risultato finale + lo script in python, se volete divertirvi anche voi.  
Ho semplificato alcuni parametri e mi son riferito puramente alla preparazione di un caffe' espresso

Costo del caffe' in grani specialty

Solitamente compro pacchi da 250 grammi a non meno di 18 Euro l'uno (anche il meno costoso di Gardelli costa circa 16 Euro).

Ho preso quindi **18 Euro** come riferimento e 9 grammi come dose di un singolo caffe'.  
Quindi dose da **9 grammi** mi costa circa **0.65 Euro**

**Elettricita'**

Ho attaccato uno smart plug direttamente alla ciabatta che fornisce energia al macina caffe' e alla mia dual boiler e monitorato il consumo di corrente durante la mattinata. 2 caffe' singoli in sequenziale, tenendo conto anche del cold start e del passaggio da standby (72 gradi) a ready (92 gradi).

Interessante notare come i picchi arrivino a 1300 W.  
Vi lascio i grafici in allegato per farvi una idea. Comunque una preparazione di caffe' in media ha richiesto **0.243 kWh.**  
Come costo al **kWh ho usato 0.25 Euro** di media (tenendo presente le mie ultime bollette e aggregando tutte le spese)

**Acqua**

Qui, ho semplificato un po'.  
Io utilizzo l'acqua della Brita sia per bere che per la macchina espresso.  
Quindi tenendo conto che cambio un filtro al mese, ho semplificato dicendo che utilizzo 40 ml d'acqua per una singola preparazione (mi son tenuto davvero largo).  
Un filtro dura 150 Litri. Quindi ho calcolato in totale quanto costa la singola preparazione rapportato al prezzo di un filtro Brita.

**Costo di ammortamento Macchina del Caffe e Grinder**

Ho calcolato il deprezzamento di entrambi i macchinari per il periodo di tempo che penso di utilizzarli.  
Al fine di capire il ""caso peggiore"" ho deciso di considerare 5 anni come utilizzo della macchina e del macina caffe' prima di rivenderle.

Costo di acquisto di entrambe 2500 Euro  
Prezzo di rivendita ipotizzato a 1500 Euro.  
Ovvio sono assunzioni. In realta' il caso pessimo sarebbe mettere a zero il costo di rivendita, cosi' da avere un costo di deprezzamento pari a 2500 Euro.

Quindi:  
\- costo di acquisto - prezzo di vendita = deprezzamento.  
\- deprezzamento per caffe' preparato = deprezzamento / numero di tazze.

Per numero di tazze ho considerato 5 caffe al giorno per 5 anni in questo caso.

Arriviamo ai numeri totali.. rullo di tamburi

    Total cost per cup (over 5 years): 0.84€
    
    Breakdown:
    
    Depreciation: 0.11€ (13%)  
    Electricity: 0.06€ (7%)  
    Coffee beans: 0.65€ (77%)  
    Water: 0.02€ (3%)  

Costo di un caffe' **84 centesimi**!  
Non e' una sorpresa che la qualita' del caffe' influisca pesantemente.  
Al secondo posto c'e' di fatto il costo dei gingilli che usiamo.  
Se avessi messo 0 su prezzo di rivendita, questo sarebbe stato il breakdown

    Total cost per cup (over 5 years): 1.01€
    
    Breakdown:
    
    Depreciation: 0.27€ (27%)  
    Electricity: 0.06€ (6%)  
    Coffee beans: 0.65€ (64%)  
    Water: 0.02€ (2%)  
    
        """"""
        Cost per cup
        Script that estimates the price of a single cup of coffee prepared at 
        
        Assumptions:
        - Equipment cost includes coffee machine, grinder, main accessories and maintenance tools
        - Resale value is the price at which you would resell both coffee machine and grinder at the end of the usage period.
        you can set it to 0 if you keep the machine
        
        Contributions to the cost per cup
        - Coffee machine and grinder per coffee cup, provided their depreciation over the years.
        - Electricity cost per coffee cup
        - Water cost per coffee cup
        - Coffee bean cost per coffee cup

1n2ics7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChristianDating/comments/1n2ics7/women_do_you_think_your_dating_expectations_are/,Women: Do you think your dating expectations are too high?,"I encountered a guy yesterday who responded to my comment about men sometimes expecting a lot of immediate investment when they lack focus or intentionality. I gave an example of men talking briefly, not asking much about me, being vague when I ask questions, and then asking if I’m interested. He told me Christian women have “high expectations” like wanting to be courted and led - which to me was kind of silly because...yes? This is a Christian sub, and we’ve discussed in previous posts that the man is typically the spiritual leader.

I know some people may have very high expectations, but I don’t think being thoughtful in discussions and assessing each other before expressing interest is unreasonable.

For me personally:

- I’d like to be a stay-at-home mom and watch over the children (not a country girl or homestead type). But I also would want to pursue my hobbies and try to make some active and passive income.

- I care more about someone embodying values through kindness and compassion than being highly active in ministry. People can do works in public and then be mean in private so being kind, thoughtful, and patient is more important to me.

- Physical preferences: at least 5'8"" (I’m 5’5”), darker hair, not overweight; big muscles aren't a huge factor. 

- Personality & connection: Introverted, observant, with shared humor. I want someone who’s socially skilled, makes me laugh as I make him laugh, and can share meaningful conversation.  Simple dates are fine: movies, burgers, walks, ice cream. Fancy dates can come for special occasions.  Honesty is crucial. Sincere interest > empty flattery. Not lustful in the sense of criticizing sexual women & then looking at them/ paying for them or having a history of impulsive sexual behavior that indicates they don't value intimacy. I know everyone has sexual desire, I just don't want to have to worry about *loyalty*. 

I’d like to hear what other women expect too. Please be honest! :

1. **Finances & lifestyle:** Do you want to be a stay-at-home mom? Have a homestead? Do both partners work?

2. **Values:** Beyond the obvious of being Christian, do you expect someone who volunteers a lot, works in ministry, or is a youth group leader? Do you expect him to be the spiritual leader of the household?

3. **Physical attraction:**  We all know this is a thing for both men and women. That's why the most attractive people typically get the most upvotes and comments like ""rip Dms"". And why there's posts or comments about it about every month. So let's be real about it. Height, body type, hair, facial hair, style etc.? 

4. **Approach:** This one seems to be a bit confusing to people. How do you like a man to approach you with interest? Do you want him to give you a flirty line about how beautiful you are? Do you want him to observe you first and then comment on your personality or interests? Are you OK with the cold approach of just asking you out? Getting ""Hey wyd?"" and then having to carry the conversation yourself? 

5. **Dates:** Daressing up for fancy dates early on or casual ones like coffee? Split the bill or prefer the man pays? The person who asked for the date pays? Do you alternate?

This is where im at right now. I have not been getting any responses from managers or recruiters.

My portfolios have ranged from simulations to ICP’s to mini account plans. How else can I stand out? And if someone has a diagnosis for why i might not be getting responses thatd be great, especially when i get a rejection before a message lol

I'm selling today my Jorg Hysek fountain pen.

A hell of a fountain pen, either you love it or hate it. Its peculiar and unique shape makes it a friend for larger hands rather than the smaller ones. 

The nib is 18k gold, body is striped.

I hardly ever used the pen, around ten times and it never left the drawer since.

I gave it a deep clean last week, inked it again with a Waterman Havana cartridge and now everything is absolutely smooth.

The fountain pen is available in Paris, France, if someone wants to see it and give it a try, I'd be glad to share a cup of coffee around the pen.

The pen is in perfect condition and comes with its pen holder in brown alligator with a beautiful patina. The holder clip corroded with time (see pictures), which is reflected in the price and the reason why I rate its condition to \[B\].

Pen and holder album : [https://jpl.viewbook.com/album/album-4](https://jpl.viewbook.com/album/album-4)

Asked price is 450,00€ including shipping in France/Europe.  
If oversea, we have to check how it works first, so we can use comments section for that.

In case you want/need more images, please ask and I'll upload new pictures to the gallery.

As the pen is hard to find and not that often on the market, it might be difficult to set a price to it, so be honest and let me know in a public comment how you feel about it, I've no intention to try to overprice any transaction and am open to meet at a fair market price.",3,1756401529.0,Pen_Swap,3,1.0,False

Here’s What to Do in Just One Afternoon,"Savannah is such an easy city to enjoy whether you’re with friends or on your own. It’s walkable, laid-back, and has plenty to fill an afternoon without feeling rushed.

Here’s how I spent it:

🌳 **Start at Forsyth Park** – Take a walk, grab a photo at the fountain, then wander through the shady squares. They’re great for catching up with friends or just enjoying some quiet if you’re solo.

☕ **Coffee + Bite** – *The Collins Quarter* is a nice stop for a latte or a light lunch. The lavender latte is popular, and their menu works well for sharing or a casual solo meal.

🛍 **Shops + Treats** – *The Paris Market* is fun to browse, and *River Street Sweets* has pralines that are hard to pass up (they hand out samples too).

🍹 **Rooftop Views** – In the late afternoon, head to *Peregrin Rooftop* for skyline views or *Rocks on the Roof* if you’d rather sit by the river. Both are good spots to wind down.

👻 **Evening Option** – If you want to stretch the day, Savannah is known for its ghost tours. It’s an easy add-on whether you’re with a group or on your own.

When it comes to dating I've always been cautious and set my expectations as low as possible until now. after talking for a few days and discovering the large amount of qualities, hobbies, etc. that we have in common, I aaked if we could meet for coffee. He agreed but when the day came, it was radio silence from Axel and he texted me that night saying he had to work late. After that, I tried to detach myself a bit from the romantic side of things and just be friends. It was difficult to do so because he continued flirting and still expressed an interest in me. One of my friends told me to ignore him and see if he would reach out on his own and he did after barely a day of silence on my end. I have ADHD and anxiety so mixed signals are not a friend of mine and it's all so confusing. When I ask him straight up if he's still interested, he says yes. Yet, his actions suggest otherwise and he just doesn't seem as interested in me anymore. Last week, I once again asked Axel if we could meet sometime that week. He said yes and I waited to hear details but they never came and another week passed. To be fair I didn't mention it again because I wasn't sure how to proceed tbh.

**Floorplan:** 1E  
\- Just under 700sqft  
\- 10th floor w/ convenient elevator access; the freight elevator is nearby which is awesome for moving in/out, and the regular elevators are just around the corner. You can use either one as long as the freight elevator isn't reserved.  
\- Full size Washer/Dryer in-unit  
\- Lots of natural light in the kitchen & living room from 2 giant windows. The windows have nice wood blinds already installed.  
\- HUGE kitchen island with lots of cabinet storage  
\- Stainless steel appliances  
\- No window in bedroom but trust me you're gonna love it, I've never slept better in my life.

\- That base price includes a storage unit right down the hall from the apartment for $25/mo; you don't have to keep it if you don't need it, but it's definitely convenient!  
\- My utilities average about $80/mo in the summer and $65-$70 in the fall/winter.  
\- Internet is separate, but I currently pay $75/mo for super fast Quantum Fiber just to give you an idea of that cost.

\- If you want to stay beyond the lease-end date, you'll have the option to renew for a full lease term at the rate presented by the leasing office 60 days before the lease ends.

**Special Requirements:** Pay the $29 application fee to SOVA on Grant and consent to a credit & background check.  
\- I'll need your name and email address to give to the leasing office to move forward so they can send you all the necessary documents. *\*Please only send this info in a DM for your privacy\**

A growing group of coffee shops and coffee carts with roots in New York City will be expanding further into the Boston area, moving into a landmark space where a breakfast and lunch spot had been for 70 years.

According to a press release, Blank Street Coffee is planning to open in Allston, taking over the former  Twin Donuts space on Cambridge Street. The Hamilton Company, a local real estate organization, will restore the neon Twin Donuts sign and the Blank Street branding will be incorporated into the sign, with Jameson Brown, Chairman and CEO of The Hamilton Company stating that ""Blank Street's preservation of the iconic Twin Donuts sign really honors the long history of that property as a special place that is beloved in the community."" If all goes as planned, the new location of Blank Street Coffee could open in the late spring of 2026 and it will be the eighth Boston-area location.

Twin Donuts dated back to the mid-1950s, offering such items as bagels, muffins, croissants, breakfast and lunch sandwiches, pancakes, French toast, omelets, and salads.",31,1756400299.0,boston,30,0.94,False

1n2hq1q,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n2hq1q,OutIn Fino Portable Electric Coffee Grinder Review,"Hey everyone! How are you?

Since there aren't any reviews of OutIn's electric coffee grinder here on the sub, I decided to talk a little about it. I apologize in advance for the long text.

I tried to upload a video, but I couldn't. I don't know if external links are allowed, so I'll try adding images to the text.

When you receive the grinder, it's not fully charged. In fact, it doesn't come with enough battery to grind. So, after removing the seal/stickers, you'll plug it in to charge. The charging port is on the back of the device.

The manual instructs you to use the cable that comes with the grinder and to use a 5V/1A charger. Has the white light stopped flashing? It's fully charged. It takes about an hour to fully charge.

Clear/white light: 100%~30%.
 Yellow light: 20% (I charge when the yellow light appears)
Red light: Charge the grinder.

Warning if you didn't respect the ""breathing time"" (90 seconds between grinds) or grinded for more than 5 minutes: The white light will flash 3 times and your grinder will stop working. I'm a bit of a wimp and I respected the recommended time. I haven't had any problems with this.

""Bean blockage"" warning (some beans got stuck): The red lights will flash. This happened to me. I gently tapped the side and the grinder corrected it, grinding the stuck beans during the next grind. If that doesn't work: Disassemble (explained below) and clean.

Construction:

It's made of aluminum, silicone, and food-grade plastic. It has a 38mm conical (7-sided) blade, external adjustment, and a rubberized base to keep your grinder steady while grinding. It weighs 690 grams.

 It has a great grip, and although I've only used it twice, I feel confident in saying it's comfortable to carry. With my bad arm, I managed to carry a backpack, a scale, the Nano, and a V60 with it. If I didn't feel uncomfortable, you certainly won't.

It's solid enough to stay put on your countertop, yet light enough to carry in your backpack.

Passions aside, it's truly beautiful. You don't need to hide it in a cabinet. It's a device you're proud to have on your countertop (I'm trying to contain myself here, as I think the Fino is the most beautiful device in my setup).

Maximum grind capacity:

25 grams. Can it handle 25 grams? Yes, but it can make a mess, and yes, that's a personal thing, but 25 grams per grind is a lot for me. I make 5, 6, 16, and 18 grinds. No mess and in what I consider to be a great time.

Grinding time:

The manual calls for a 90-second rest between grinds and advises not to grind for more than five minutes continuously.

 Some notes on grinding time:

Grinding 5 grams on click 1: 37 seconds

Grinding 15.5 grams on click 2: 58 seconds

Grinding 5 grams on click 3: 25 seconds

Grinding 5 grams on click 4: 25 seconds

Grinding 5 grams on click 5: 22 seconds

Grinding 5 grams on click 6: 18 seconds

Grinding 5 grams on click 7: 17 seconds

Grinding 16.2 grams on click 7: 48 seconds

Grinding 5 grams on click 8: 17 seconds

Grinding 5 grams on click 9: 15 seconds

Grinding 5 grams on click 10: 14 seconds

Grinding:

Uniform, consistent, generates very few fines and retention is minimal (in most cases).  Most of the time, I didn't experience any retention. I have a video showing this, in case anyone is interested. I took the photos at all grind levels. One additional note: I didn't clean (disassemble) the grinder between grinds. I started at 10 and worked my way down to 01, just to capture real-life use.
See the photos and let me know what you think.

Cleaning:

Using the key (it's inside the grinder box, next to the handle), turn it counterclockwise and remove the parts (memorize the order: screw, blade, spring. Use the opposite direction when assembling). Then, use the blower (they send one inside the box) and a dry, clean brush. Clean and reassemble.

Battery life:

Initially, I used it and didn't keep a count. For this analysis, I grinded 19 grinds of different sizes and weights, and the battery indicator remains white (100%~30%).  During the 19 grinds, I ground about 150 grams of coffee.

Noise:

In my opinion, the noise is completely tolerable. Since I couldn't upload a video to Reddit, I tested it with a decibel meter (it's not a professional decibel meter, but it was the best way I could find to ""show"" the noise to you).

Pros and Cons:

Regarding the pros and cons, a direct and completely honest opinion: I could say that ""my ratio, for filter coffees, is 16 grams (1:15.6). If I needed to make two filter coffees at the same time, I wouldn't be able to, since the Fino's maximum capacity per grind is 25 grams,"" but I found it unfair to the grinder. I wouldn't make two filter coffees at the same time in practically any real-life situation. I have observations about the Nano, for example, but the Fino, in my opinion, has no negative points.

 I owned a C3 and a K4 and... Well, I'm very happy with the Fino and don't miss my old grinders at all. I also don't see myself replacing this grinder with another (remember: This is very personal. For me, it's perfect). It's beautiful, portable, has an excellent battery, virtually no retention, a good weight, the grind is uniform and consistent, its construction is incredible, and the only physical effort I need to exert is pressing a button.

That's it, folks. If I missed any details, feel free to ask me in the comments and I'll be happy to answer.

I came across multiple sources of how nicotine enhances attention and boosts learning ability, just like with coffee, but on a grander scale. I really don't get the hype with coffee anyway, I don't feel any change when I have a cup, and if I have some more It'll just make my hands shake and heart pound. I can still pretty confident that I can cheat my way through college as well but at the end of the day I don't wanna be unemployed with only a diploma in my hand yn. So what yall think?

1n2hncs,https://www.reddit.com/r/InsideIndianMarriage/comments/1n2hncs/toxic_mil/,Toxic MIL!,"My MIL is very over-involved, almost like I’m invisible compared to her son. She would bring food all the way from the kitchen to our room just for my husband, but tell me to go get it myself. She pampered him in every possible way even laying out his clothes while he bathed. Things really crossed the line when she began interfering in our private life, even telling my husband when we should be intimate. That was the breaking point for me, and I told him to make her stop and mind her own business.

To add to all this, I’m from Kerala and my parents had given me gold well before marriage. By the 4th day of my wedding, my mother-in-law saw it and immediately commented, “Your parents must have bought all this earlier, right?” Then she went and told her sister about it in front of me, and her sister said, “Yes, I’ve heard so much about your gold.” I was stunned it felt so shameless and intrusive. In that moment I thought, “Wow, they really have no filter,” and it just confirmed the kind of mentality I was going to be dealing with.

On top of that, her constant nagging made everything worse. Whenever I tried helping in the kitchen, she would nitpick: don’t wash the rice that way, don’t hold the spoon like that, don’t drink coffee because it causes constipation, don’t pet dogs — the list went on. I got so frustrated that I finally told her I didn’t like her nagging. She took it the wrong way and gave me the silent treatment for days, but honestly, I felt relieved since I prefer peace.
Eventually, she started talking to me again, but by now I had lost any desire to build a bond with her. It’s been a year since I got married, and our relationship is very transactional — just basic household talk.

Met with provider to check in the other day. I was describing my symptoms when I am taking my meds and coming off of them which mostly includes extreme exhaustion. 

We started talking a bit more and he started asking if when I had been off stimulants how my energy and sleep were. And my response was that I was always tired (even if I get a full 7-8 hours). I could drink coffee and feel it but once my body got used to it I would get sleepy again until I loaded up more which I tried to not do. I used to nap in the afternoon and this could be for 1-2 hours easily when not on stimulants.

He asked about my dreams and I do on occasion get very vivid dreams that feel like I am there like all my senses are firing. Ive had sleep paralysis in the past and usually dream more when detoxing from caffine. When I start falling asleep I am still awake but images of random shit come I to view with my eyes closed and I sometimes hear what I like to describe as radio chatter.

His reason for asking me is because he is telling me what I described is what he has heard others in his practice tell him who have a full diagnoses. He told me to research and let him know if I want to do a sleep study.

1n2hm0e,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1n2hm0e/can_ge_fxhtc_whole_house_water_filter_improve/,Can GE FXHTC whole house water filter improve your home's water quality? Review here!,"Testing the GE FXHTC Whole House Water Filter has been an adventure in home water filtration that I didn't know I needed. From waking up to clearer coffee to feeling like my morning shower had a slightly less chlorine-y vibe, this filter has subtly improved my daily routine. The GE FXHTC manages to reduce chlorine, sediment, rust, and sand, living up to its promises. After installing it into my system, I immediately noticed the water seemed, well, “cleaner.” My coworkers even mentioned how I couldn't shut up about how the filtered water was tasting better during our lunch breaks. Its compatibility with popular GE systems like GXWH40L and GXWH30C was a lifesaver too; no weird adjustments or extra tools were needed. And since it's NSF certified, I wasn’t just trusting my taste buds—it was a scientifically-backed improvement.

**Performance and Filtration Capabilities**  
The performance is solid. It captures and reduces the nasty stuff in water—chlorine taste, sediment you don’t want to know about, and even rust. Living in an older house, rusty water was more common than I liked, especially after heavy rains. With this filter, rust traces in the water became almost non-existent. It’s rated for about three months or 30,000 gallons, which means replacing it is not the sort of headache you’ll face often. That’s roughly a quarter of a year before you start worrying about losing efficiency.

[Grab GE FXHTC Whole House Water Filter at the best price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b0025yuf68/)  

**Ease of Installation and Maintenance**  
Installing this filter was surprisingly easy. For someone who’s not exactly a plumber, swapping out the old cartridge was as simple as screwing in a lightbulb. The universal fit for most 10-inch high-flow systems is a huge plus, and the whole thing is refreshingly fuss-free. I didn’t have to consult YouTube or summon my dad for advice (though I did proudly FaceTime him after I finished). Maintenance is straightforward too—just mark the calendar for the next replacement or wait until you notice the water starting to lose that purified feel.  

**Durability and Build Quality**  
The build feels sturdy and reliable. Made from granular activated carbon, this isn’t a flimsy piece of plastic that’s going to snap during installation or fail within weeks. It weighs about 2.1 pounds, which doesn’t sound like much, but you can feel the heft and quality when holding it. It’s clear this is designed to withstand everyday use for its intended lifespan.  

**Good Points**  
- Certified for efficiently reducing chlorine taste, sediment, sand, and rust.  
- Universally compatible with several whole-home filter systems.  
- Long filter life of up to three months or 30,000 gallons.  

**Drawbacks**  
- Requires frequent replacements if you’re using a lot of water (family of 5, take note).  
- Doesn’t target more advanced contaminants beyond the basics like lead or bacteria.  
- The activated carbon can leave very faint black particles initially if not flushed properly.

**Market Rivals**  
When compared to other options like the Culligan WH-HD200-C or the iSpring FM15B, the GE FXHTC lines up pretty well. The Culligan offers a higher level of filtration for some bacteria and fluoride, but it comes at a steeper price over time with quicker filter replacements. On the other hand, the iSpring version works effectively but doesn’t offer the same compatibility across a wider range of existing systems. One place where the GE filter shines is in simplicity and reliability—its performance may not be revolutionary, but it’s dependable and cost-effective compared to premium specialized water filters.

**Worth Every Penny**  
At its price point, this filter delivers excellent bang for the buck. It’s not high-end, cutting-edge technology, but it doesn’t pretend to be. You’re paying for a reliable, practical solution to everyday water filtration issues without overcomplicating the process. For those with average water clarity concerns like chlorine or basic sediment, this product is absolutely worth the investment.

How’s life? Don’t you ever feel pressured to be in a relationship? Because that’s exactly what I’ve been feeling lately, probably since most of my friends are already in one. There are times I want to go out, like visit a coffee shop or just chill somewhere, but wala akong makasama since my friends and I are now busy with our own lives after graduating college.

Back in high school and college, I really chose to stay single and focus on my studies, and I was happy with it naman since I didn’t feel na single ako because I was always with my girl friends. But now that I’m entering adulthood, I sometimes find myself wishing I had someone to share stories about life with, aside from my family, and my communication with my friends is not as frequent na rin.

I’m only 23 though, and feeling ko once I start my career, don naman ako mag-ffocus. I feel like I’ll be a workaholic and will really prioritize my career first. I’m also afraid to date (especially if galing online) kasi parang feeling ko most guys right now are not genuine, or baka nadala lang din ako sa mga stories na nababasa ko here sa Reddit.

I’m also a homebody person so I don’t even know how I’d meet someone. Kusa ba talaga dadating, like maghihintay na lang talaga ko? Or maybe I really need to put an effort to meet people na? Hahaha.

Like full send. Boots, hat, reading dusty frontier journals at 3 AM, drinking black coffee out of a tin cup like I just shot a man in Dodge City. It started off harmless, just “yee” and “haw.”

But then something weird happened. Every time I slip into cowboy mode, my brain drifts toward… let’s just say “historically accurate but morally disgusting” ways of thinking. Suddenly I’m not from the suburbs, I’m Jedediah the cattle wrangler who thinks women shouldn’t read and anyone not named Chad or Bill is suspicious.

I don’t *want* this. I’m not racist in real life. But as soon as that cowboy hat touches my head, the ghosts of 1800s ranchers crawl into my skull and start drafting slurs like it’s open mic night in hell. It’s like my brain is role-playing the worst parts of history without my consent.

The other day it got ridiculous. I was at Target with my wife, just minding my own business, and I spotted a sale on rope in the hardware aisle. My dumb cowboy brain kicked in instantly and I caught myself whispering “perfect for a hanging” out loud. OUT LOUD. Some poor lady in the aisle just looked at me horrified while I pretended I was talking about hanging up a planter. I almost had to fake a phone call just to cover how insane I sounded.

I’ll be standing in my kitchen, casually twirling a lasso, and then some thought pops in that would get me banned from every platform on Earth. Meanwhile my wife’s looking at me like “why are you staring out the window whispering about land rights.”

I want the aesthetic, the tumbleweeds, the whiskey, the slow drawl… but I don’t want to wake up one day and realize I’ve actually become the sheriff of Jim Crow Junction.

So how do I keep the yee and the haw, but stop my brain from turning into a Confederate Facebook group every time I put on cowboy boots?",0,1756399503.0,DecidingToBeBetter,15,0.18,False

I’m 30F and audhd and wanted to share something that’s been on my mind.

I worked with two people (I'll call them Boy A and Girl B) outside of my department on a project for about a year. We only ever met over Zoom. Now, I don’t know if this is related to my autism, but I didn’t really think we had any sort of relationship beyond work. The only things we ever said to each other were “good morning,” “goodbye,” and whatever was necessary to discuss the project.

Anyway, at one point, Boy A asked me to get coffee. I said “sure,” but I never followed through or scheduled a time. I guess I missed some social cues, which tends to happen sometimes. But honestly, I didn’t think much of it.

Then, maybe a few weeks or about a month later (I’m not totally sure), I reached out and asked if they still wanted to do that coffee thing. Boy A said yes, but then mentioned that Girl B would be coming along too.

Now I’m just confused—why is Girl B coming? Do they want to be friends? I genuinely don’t understand why they’d want to spend time with me outside of work. I'm trying to figure out what this means, or if I'm just overthinking it.",1,1756399340.0,AutisticAdults,5,0.67,False

I (30F) am in a long-distance relationship with my boyfriend (30M). I’m struggling with how we handle money and what it says about our future.

When we first met then later he decided to come to visit me in my country cause he wanted us to build a relationship, I was unemployed at that time. He was the one who decided to come and also suggested we do a trip together to the neighboring country. He asked me to join and I said yes, and I paid for our bus tickets (it was easier for me since I had access to the booking platform) He covered the hotel and most meals. I bought some of our coffees and drinks cause I couldn’t afford more as I was unemployed. But during that trip, he made a comment I hated something like: “Oh wow, these photos you took of me are amazing, so all the restaurants I paid for were worth it.” It made me feel really uncomfortable, like the money he spent had to be “justified.”

Then, a month later, he wanted me to travel spend Christmas with him. At first, I told him I couldn’t because I didn’t have a job yet and I wanted to focus on finding one. He got sad and offended, saying our relationship wouldn’t work if we didn’t do trips together. And he offered to pay for my ticket so I go, but then told me I should cover my return flight because he wanted to “see effort” from me. Even though I was still unemployed with very little savings I agreed and paid for it cause it sounded fair even though it was hard for me financially. 

Fast-forward: I finally got a job, but I still earn about 3–4 times less than he does. When I visited him in his country which was again a mutual decision, I paid for my plane ticket which was almost half my salary and he said, “Don’t worry, once you’re here you won’t need to think about other expenses.” He did pay majority of our meals and restaurant bills but while I was there, he still asked me things like: “Can you cover this meal?” or “Would you pay for my drink?” It feels like he sometimes sees me as if I don’t pay anything and just want to be provided for, even though I literally gave away half my salary just to be there. Meanwhile, for him, that same trip in total cost a much smaller percentage of his income

I don’t expect him to pay for everything, but I feel like he doesn’t see the imbalance. He makes several times what I make, but I go beyond my means to make it work with the trips and don’t manage to save, while he even though mathematically spending more doesn’t sacrifice nearly as much as I do. I do try to show appreciation for what he covers: I cook for him when I visit, plan things for us to do, do the dishes and I always bring or send him thoughtful gifts. He even tells me I’m the most thoughtful girlfriend he’s ever had when it comes to gifts. I really try to contribute in every way I can, but sometimes it still feels like he doesn’t notice how much I’m already putting in.

What really worries me isn’t the money itself, but the lack of consideration for my situation. It makes me question whether I want to commit long-term, marriage, family, a future together with someone who doesn’t always show that kind of thoughtfulness. 

I would really love to hear some outside thoughts on this and also I wonder how do I bring this up to him in a way that shows I don’t expect a provider, but just want more consideration for our different situations? 

TL;DR: I (30F) earn much less than my boyfriend (30M). He doesn’t insist on 50/50, but the way he casually asks me to pay here and there makes it feel unfair, especially since I spend such a big portion of my income just to see him. I don’t expect him to be a provider, but I do want more consideration. How do I bring this up to him without sounding like I don’t want to contribute?",1,1756399140.0,relationship_advice,7,0.67,False

I got some bloodwork done that said my triglycerides were slightly high, so I ended up buying a walking pad for my standing desk at work. Since July 1, I've been walking anywhere from 8-15 miles in a day, depending on how often I need to be away from my desk. My wife and I also bought bicycles so we ride around the city instead of driving. I also bought some Brooks running shoes because my slip-on Sketchers were killing my feet after a week or so.

I've really enjoyed it and I've obviously seen results, most notably that I need a belt for the shorts and pants I wear on a day-to-day basis. I was standing in the kitchen with my wife a couple of weeks ago and my shorts fell straight to my ankles (my wife couldn't breathe because she was laughing so hard). 

I calculated my TDEE to be around 3,400 calories. Herein is the problem. My diet has always been pretty clean (lean proteins and vegetables for dinner, salad for lunch with oil/vinegar dressing) and the reason I got up that high in weight was lack of activity (no exercise for literally over a decade) and beer. I've cut back on the beer and I'm obviously more active now. On a daily basis, I'm maybe taking in 1,500 calories of food. I'm aware that my protein needs are pretty high for recovery, so I've just been upping the lean proteins during lunch and dinner. I still don't think I'm getting enough. Yesterday, for example, I consumed 70g of protein, mostly from turkey and eggs. 

I'm also not eating breakfast, just coffee and water (drinking plenty of water, with an electrolyte packet after walking), and tend to walk 6 or so miles at my desk before my lunch break. Should I be eating in the morning to help fuel myself for these walks? We hardboil a lot of eggs because my wife loves them, so that would be an easy thing to prepare, but I usually just don't feel hungry in the morning. Should I be looking in to protein supplements, or just up my food intake? Sorry for the questions, this is all new to me and I just want to make sure I'm on the right track.

1n2h4f5,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeLoadout/comments/1n2h4f5/evaluate_the_best_bread_machine_oster_5838_and_is/,Evaluate the best bread machine Oster 5838 and is it worth it,"Testing out the Oster 5838 has been an adventure, especially for someone like me who loves the idea of freshly baked bread filling the kitchen with that irresistible aroma. I've spent countless mornings tinkering with its features, and while it's not absolutely flawless, it brings a lot to the table—literally and figuratively. The first thing that really grabbed my attention was its ability to bake a bread loaf in under an hour. Yes, you read that correctly. If you’re someone prone to late-night cravings or last-minute lunch prep, this thing is a lifesaver. With eight bread settings and an easy-to-use control panel, it feels like this breadmaker is practically begging you to get creative.  

**Ease of Use**  
The simplicity of this machine is where it really hooks you. I’ve tried other kitchen gadgets that made me feel like I needed an engineering degree to use them, but not this. The Oster 5838 comes with a user-friendly three-step programming panel that even my not-so-tech-savvy parents could handle. Whether you want a light, medium, or dark crust or need a simple French bread or whole wheat loaf, all it takes is a few button presses. The intuitive design really made first-time use a breeze for me, and I liked how the digital display is manageable even in my chaotic pre-coffee state.  

**Design and Build Quality**  
Its sleek, white compact design doesn’t scream for countertop attention, but it sits comfortably in its corner like the dependable kitchen gadget it is. At 15.6 x 12.5 x 12.3 inches and weighing in at roughly 14 pounds, the size is convenient without dominating your entire kitchen. The build feels robust yet understated, and the aluminum bread pan adds a nice nonstick quality that eliminates the usual hassle of bread sticking to the sides. Removing the loaf is smooth, and cleanup is far less daunting compared to other machines I've used.  

**Advantages**  
- Baking in under an hour on the ExpressBake setting saves so much time.  
- Offers versatility with eight settings, accommodating various bread types and even jams.  
- The 13-hour delay timer is excellent for pre-planning meals or waking up to warm bread.  
- The one-hour keep-warm feature saved my forgetful self a few times.  
- Compact design and intuitive control panel add charm and ease.  

[Check Oster 5838 price on Amazon.](https://windtoons.com/p/b00005otxk/)  

**Performance**  
The Oster 5838 delivers a dependable two-pound loaf every time, though I did experiment with its smaller 1.5-pound capacity when testing out denser recipes like banana bread. With its even baking and consistent results, I never ended up with those frustrating edges that are either overbaked or weirdly doughy. Speed aside, the quality of the bread—soft interiors with just the right crust—is hard to beat. However, the keep-warm feature does affect crust crispiness if the bread sits too long. It’s minor, but it’s worth keeping in mind if crunchy textures are a must for you.  

**Flaws**  
- The viewing window isn't as transparent as I would’ve liked; I found myself squinting at times.  
- Regardless of the compact design, the machine can feel bulky if your counter space is limited.  
- It’s not the quietest kitchen gadget—during those early morning ExpressBake runs, the kneading noise was noticeable.  

**Competing Brands**  
When I compare the Oster 5838 to breadmakers like the Zojirushi Virtuoso or Panasonic’s SD-RD250, it’s clear you trade off some advanced settings for affordability. Zojirushi offers higher customizability and dual kneading blades for more consistent mixing, but this comes at nearly double the cost. Panasonic’s model is a tad quieter and feels sleeker, though it often misses the convenience of an ExpressBake feature. For someone like me, who prioritizes time-saving without compromising quality, the Oster 5838 strikes an excellent balance.  

**True Value**  
While the Oster 5838 doesn’t boast all the bells and whistles of high-end breadmakers, it’s not designed to. Its strength lies in its simplicity and reliability for a more modest price point. If you believe in getting what you pay for—and maybe a little extra in this case—this breadmaker is perfect for occasional to moderate use. For its price versus utility ratio, I’ve found very few machines that can match its consistency and speed.

1n2h3js,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1n2h3js/alright_here_i_go_quitting_tomorrow_morning/,"Alright, here I go. Quitting tomorrow morning.","Today was my last day using caffeine. I'm quitting all forms of coffee, tea, chocolate and cocoa starting from tomorrow morning. My goal is to stick it out at least until the end of the year. Hopefully by the 4-month mark I'll be past the hump and sustaining nocaf will be relatively effortless. 

Here's to better sleep, less anxiety, less sweatiness, better poops, better hydration, better skin, and a clear mind. Based on my previous examples I know to expect some headache during the withdrawal and major afternoon slumps. But hoping the afternoon slumps will decrease once my body adjusts.

1n2h26y,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1n2h26y/death_an_ungrateful_and_eternal_job/,"Death, an ungrateful and eternal job","Death is a part of life.

It is unavoidable, no matter what one might do the ending will always be the same.

But it isn’t something bad, it’s just how the world works.

Death helps bring meaning to life.

 Many may think that death is the ending of one's existence, but that’s not true.

In death, one passes through the thin veil that separates our planes of existence.

Our realm is divided into 3 sections.

The first is called the dark forest, where souls are lost and in need of guidance.

The second is the river, where the newly departed must wait for the Conveyor.

The last is the true afterlife, we don’t know what awaits there, for we have other duties that must be fulfilled.

I work in the first section, helping the lost towards the river.

I am commonly called by mortals the grim Reaper, but I am not alone, I just work in an area of the globe, the rest is covered by others like me.

I prefer to call us Guides, because just like Dante needed the guide of Virgilio, so too the recently departed need our help to walk on their new path.

I once had a name, since I was once human, but I no longer remember it, for it hasn’t been spoken in centuries.

I don’t remember my mortal life, not my mother nor father, not my wife, not my happiness or pain.

I only remember one emotion, the happiness of being a father.

That moment must have had such an impact on me, that it left a mark on my very soul.

Also the other Guides remember only one emotion correlated to something really important.

Our views and personalities are shaped by those emotions.

I have a fatherly attitude towards the souls, helping them walk a path just like a father would help their child.

But happiness isn’t the only thing that can leave a mark on the soul.

One of the few colleges I saw during my eternal duty, was extremely melancholic.

His emotion was fear, the fear of a boy in a building during a carpet bombing.

He told me that while helping an old lady to get up from her sofa where a heart attack took her away.

Anger is also a strong emotion, the Guide I saw with such an emotion had to restrain himself to not beat up some of the souls he was helping.

Still we do not interact often, since we are always guiding new souls through the dark and cold path to the river.

Many think of us as uncaring creatures that find pleasure in the suffering of the mortals.

But that is far from the truth.

We all suffer with you, forced to only look while death comes to the innocent.

I always weep with the mothers and fathers of the children whose lives are cut short.

A parent should never have the agonizing duty of burying their child.

I see everyday as people are plunged in our side, some dying peacefully in sleep, some in accidents, others because of other humans.

Our duty to guide isn’t only for humans, but also for the other living things.

But still, human deaths are more impactful to us, since we were human once.

I still remember the day where I helped the most innocent souls to cross to the next part of the afterlife.

The first was a little child, a little girl of 3 or 4 years.

It was the vigil of Christmas and the little child was sneaking through the house, hoping to meet Santa.

She hid behind the tree, waiting, and waiting, and waiting.

Sleep soon took her.

Unfortunately the father bought some cheap lights to decorate the tree.

It was an electrical malfunction that started the fire.

The center of which was the tree.

I hated every second of it, but luckily the child died due to the smoke.

She was still sleeping when she departed, and I made sure to let her rest for a bit.

It pained me to explain why her mummy couldn’t follow us.

It took 40 minutes to bring her to the river.

I wanted to stay there and keep her company, but duty was calling.

The next one was an accountant, a middle aged man with no family or friends.

He was coming back from a hard day at home, he worked a harsh and grueling job, being paid a few bucks for more than 9 hours a day.

He was a sad, lonely man.

And yet he was a very kind person, not bitter like most would think.

It was his kindness that brought him to me.

A drunk driver and a high school boy.

The man saw how the boy was about to be run over, and he sprinted and pushed him away.

The car wheels made a mess of his body.

He was really confused when he saw me.

It took me a while to convince him to follow me, but in the end I managed to bring him to the river.

There new souls waited to be transported to the other side.

I left the man near the little girl, and just as I foresaw he immediately started to comfort her.

I still had one other soul to help.

The cold nights of December are the most dangerous to the homeless population.

In a small halley was the old man, shivering on the ground, covered by a piece of cardboard.

An old gentle soul, he lost his house because of his trust in his nephew.

He gambled all his money, and once he had none left he started harassing his grandpa.

The little vermin ended up beating the old man half to death, then he stole everything.

The man didn’t want to send his nephew to prison, but when he couldn’t pay the bills he tried to find him, but the rat had jumped ship and run off.

In the end he couldn’t keep the house and had to sell it.

He didn’t find any place to live, his medication was way too expensive.

In the end the cold took him.

I helped him up and warmed his wary bones with some fire.

I brought him to the other two innocent souls near the riverbank and left him there.

I always show respect and kindness to the recently deceased, but sometimes I have to restrain myself from tearing apart some souls with my bony fingers.

Vile and evil men and women live in this world.

I saw criminals kill for petty and idiotic reasons, I saw members of the mob use children as shields, I saw business men take from the poor to enrich the elites.

The most infuriating thing is that I can’t do anything to them.

There are rules that we all must follow, we can’t just take a life and we must wait for the predicted moment of their death.

One cannot understand the fury and anger that fester in every single one of us for our impotence toward said evil.

But with rules, there are loop holes.

It was the morning of the 25th.

The night before I helped 3 kind souls, but now it was time for the 3 little bastards that caused their death.

I may have the fatherly instinct to help, but I also have the capability to punish the misbehaving.

The rules state that I can’t bring direct harm to the mortals and that I had to wait for them to die as predicted. 

But it isn’t stated that I can’t bring them pain and that I couldn’t give them something that would kill them, but much much later than their expiration date.

The first visit I made was to the woman in charge of the production of those faulty decorative lights.

She wanted more money, no matter what.

Poor pay for the workers, tax fraud, cheap and dangerous materials.

She was already in deep trouble with the law and angry families.

Her death was supposed to be violent and fast, but I had 2 hours to punish her.

I immediately tested the limits of my influence.

I tripped a man, he was carrying two cups of very hot coffee.

The liquid fell only on the tip of her fingers, burning them.

The pain made her immediately enraged.

She started to tear apart the man verbally, but I wasn't done.

Rapid temperature changes might cause dysentery, and I immediately made the temperature around her fall below zero and then brought it back to normal.

The effect was immediate.

She ran to the bathroom.

Unfortunately she was wearing heels and the floor was still quite wet.

She broke her hand against the sink.

An ambulance was called for her.

In the hospital I messed a bit with the pain medication, making sure she felt every bit of pain that the process of putting her arm back together had to offer.

Unfortunately my fun was short.

One of the people whose lives she ruined with her malfunctioning product had followed her to the hospital.

He was angry, very angry.

The nurses only noticed something was wrong when one stepped in a little stream of blood coming from the room.

One hammer and a very motivated person, that’s what it took to crush her skull into a fine pesto.

I couldn't do anything more, but I made sure she felt as scared as humanly possible.

I took her through the scariest roads I knew and I simply dropped her in an isolated part of the riverbank.

The next was the drunk bastard.

He wasn’t a first offender, he didn’t lose control of the vehicle, he wasn’t really drunk.

Alcohol didn’t affect him like others, he had a very high tolerance, but he also knew how to fake being inebriated.

He escaped prison many times with that trick, he showed to be drunk, he faked remorse, he went to rehab for a day and then started to drink and drive again.

I didn’t have to do much to make him feel pain, his body was extremely tortured by his abuse of alcohol and substances.

I just sped up the process a bit.

Kidney stones were already forming, but I made them crystallize immediately.

His failing liver was easy to collapse.

His lungs were so dark that they looked like pieces of coal.

I just made a couple of alveoli collapse and slowly filled his lungs with blood.

Adding another couple of conditions, he started to spams.

He would have still started to spams without my help, but this way he could experience more pain.

He would die because of poison, his wife was just as despicable as him.

His spams reminded me of a dying bug, wriggling around with its arts flailing around. 

I enjoyed the face he made when he realized what happened and who did it.

I must confess that I too was disgusted when his wife called over her affair partner to celebrate his death, with his corpse right next to them. 

He was devastated, it seems he really loved her.

Still I didn’t show any mercy.

I berated him during the whole voyage.

I tore at his self esteem and ridiculed him, showing him all his failures and missed opportunities.

When we arrived at the river, he was silent as a ghost.

I wanted to humiliate him a bit more but I had my last soul to pick up, and this one would have been the most satisfying.

The old man’s nephew, a bastard addicted to gambling and women.

He fled to Las Vegas.

There I started my fun.

He owed a lot of money to a lot of people, many of which are of the worst kind.

If found he would probably be beaten to death.

But his death was of a different kind and first of all I had to have fun with him.

He was in a motel with a prostitute.

She was one of the cheap ones, riddled with diseases.

He was an idiot and contracted all of them.

I just sped up the progress of the disease and watched as he started to squirm.

Then I just casually made a passing jogger drop his wallet near the motel room where the man was hiding.

Coincidentally this jogger was a friend of one of the people to whom this man owed a lot of money.

30 minutes later the man would be found by the local police tied to a pole, naked and beaten, I made sure that the guys that found him really cared about the money.

He was also hiding from the police since his grandpa did go to the competent authorities.

He was held in a holding cell while awaiting trial.

The night was unusually cold, and the cell was not really temperature proof.

The nephew died in the cell shivering just like his grandpa.

I didn’t say a word to him, I just dragged him to the river, more precisely to his grandpa.

The man was weeping like a kid.

When he saw his grandpa he tried to run to him.

But I didn’t let him, I kept him in place covering his mouth, looking as he squirmed trying to reach the comfort of his family.

I remained there for a few minutes, making sure the old man didn’t see the pathetic vermin.

Then I dragged him away and left him in the care of another Guide, we had concurred to drag him as far away from his grandpa as possible.

After all was done I went to say goodbye to the 3 innocent.

The child was sleeping in the arms of the old man, the younger one was sitting down waiting.

I stayed with them for some time.

I answered their question, the majority at least.

Only one I couldn’t answer, what’s after the river?

None of us knows, neither us Guides nor the Conveyor.

We can’t know, because we can’t go.

We must first finish our job, then we can finally reunite with the people we once cared for.

But before that we must wait, wait for the very last living being to take its last breath.

I’ve been on the road full-time for almost a year now, and while I thought I had adjusted to the challenges of RV life, one night in Oklahoma showed me just how humbling and unpredictable this lifestyle can be.

I had parked at a small campground just outside of Tulsa. It wasn’t anything fancy, just a few hookups and a wide-open field. I knew there were storms in the forecast, but honestly, I brushed it off. I’ve been through rain plenty of times before, and I figured it would just be another evening of watching raindrops slide down the windows while I cooked dinner. By nine o’clock, the wind started howling louder than I’d ever heard. The whole RV shook, and I suddenly realized how thin the walls really are when nature decides to remind you who’s in charge.

I’ll admit, I was scared. The kind of fear where you can feel it sitting in your chest. I pulled in my awning, checked all my windows, and sat there listening to the storm slam against my rig. At one point I actually grabbed my dog and considered making a run for the concrete restroom building across the campground, but then I thought about how dangerous it would be to step outside. So I stayed put, lights off, just hoping everything would hold together.

The storm lasted about an hour, but it felt much longer. When it finally passed, I stepped outside and saw branches scattered all over the field and a neighbor’s lawn chair lodged against my tire. My RV was fine, but the experience shook me. It made me realize that no matter how much I think I’ve “got this lifestyle figured out,” there are always going to be moments where I’m reminded of how small I am compared to the forces of nature.

Funny thing is, that night didn’t make me question this lifestyle, it actually made me more committed to it. Because when the sun came up the next morning, I shared coffee with my neighbors, and we all swapped stories of how we rode it out. It felt like this little unspoken bond between us, like the storm had tested us and reminded us why we choose this way of life.

RV living isn’t just about freedom and travel. Sometimes it’s about sitting through a night that rattles you to the core and then waking up the next day feeling stronger, more grateful, and a little more connected to the people around you.",19,1756398577.0,RVLiving,25,0.61,False

Understanding the Basics of Dental Hygiene

The foundation of any great teeth brushing routine starts with understanding the fundamentals of oral care. Proper brushing is about more than just running a toothbrush across your teeth for a few seconds. It requires technique, the right tools, and a consistent approach.

Key Components of an Effective Teeth Brushing Routine

1. Choosing the Right Toothbrush
• Select a soft-bristled brush that fits comfortably in your mouth
• Replace your toothbrush every 3-4 months
• Consider electric toothbrushes for more thorough cleaning

2. Selecting the Perfect Toothpaste
Different toothpastes offer various benefits:
• Fluoride toothpaste for cavity prevention
• Whitening formulas for aesthetic improvements
• Sensitive tooth formulas for those with dental sensitivity

The Optimal Brushing Technique

**Proper brushing technique is crucial** for removing plaque and preventing dental issues. Follow these step-by-step instructions:

• Hold your toothbrush at a 45-degree angle to the gums
• Use gentle, circular motions
• Brush for a full two minutes
• Cover all surfaces: outer, inner, and chewing surfaces of teeth

Time Management in Brushing

Most dental professionals recommend brushing at least twice daily – morning and night. Each brushing session should last a minimum of two minutes, ensuring thorough cleaning of all tooth surfaces.

Advanced Oral Hygiene Strategies

Beyond Basic Brushing
While brushing is essential, a comprehensive oral care routine includes additional steps:

1. Flossing Daily
• Removes plaque between teeth
• Prevents gum disease
• Reduces bad breath

2. Mouthwash Benefits
• Kills additional bacteria
• Freshens breath
• Provides extra fluoride protection

Frequency and Timing Matters

When you brush is just as important as how you brush. Dental experts recommend:
• Brushing within 30 minutes after meals
• Avoiding brushing immediately after consuming acidic foods
• Waiting at least 30 minutes after eating before brushing

Common Brushing Mistakes to Avoid

Many people unknowingly compromise their oral health through improper techniques:

• Brushing too hard
• Using the wrong toothbrush
• Not replacing toothbrush regularly
• Rushing through brushing
• Ignoring tongue cleaning

Technological Advancements in Oral Care

Modern electric toothbrushes and smart dental technologies are revolutionizing home oral care. Features like pressure sensors, multiple cleaning modes, and timer functions help users achieve more effective cleaning.

Diet and Oral Health Connection

Your diet plays a significant role in dental health:
• Limit sugary and acidic foods
• Drink plenty of water
• Consume calcium-rich foods
• Avoid excessive coffee and tea

Professional Dental Care

While an excellent home routine is crucial, regular dental check-ups remain essential. Dentists recommend:
• Bi-annual professional cleanings
• Annual comprehensive dental exams
• X-rays every 1-2 years

Conclusion

Creating the best teeth brushing routine requires dedication, proper technique, and consistent effort. By implementing these strategies, you'll not only improve your oral health but also boost",1,1756398520.0,Teethgumhealth,0,1.0,False
1n2gy23,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpotlessSecrets/comments/1n2gy23/should_you_trust_the_jc_whitlam_flow32_descaler/,Should You Trust the JC Whitlam Flow32 Descaler for Cleaning Efficiency?,"**A Trusted Solution: J.C. Whitlam FLOW32 Flow-Aide System Descaler**

Regular maintenance of appliances is key to keeping them running efficiently, and that's where the J.C. Whitlam FLOW32 Flow-Aide System Descaler comes in. This product, in its sleek 32-ounce packaging, promises an effective, non-toxic solution to combat water scale, lime, rust, and other deposits. As I tested this descaler in my household, I noticed significant differences in the performance of various appliances, but there are some areas you might want to consider before diving in.

**Practical Design and Packaging**

The straightforward design of the container caught my attention right away. A white bottle with clear labeling makes it easy to spot among other cleaning supplies. The sturdiness of the package feels just right, and I never had to worry about leaks. The 32-ounce size is very convenient for single cleaning sessions, especially if you’re like me and prefer to desalt several appliances at once. Between my coffee maker, humidifier, and dishwasher, I found the amount to be sufficient without wastage.

**Ease of Use**

Using the descaler was refreshingly simple. I poured the recommended amount into a water reservoir, let it sit for the specified time, and then rinsed away. The instructions were easy to follow, and there’s no intense scrubbing or effort needed. For someone like me, who enjoys keeping things low-maintenance yet effective, this aspect of the product stood out as a major perk.

**Positives**

- Non-toxic formula, making it safe for me to use even in my kitchen where appliances like kettles are cleaned.
- Effectively dissolves stubborn water scale and lime, improving appliance performance notably.
- Fully biodegradable and eco-friendly, which makes this product more sustainable compared to chemical-heavy alternatives.
- Easy to handle with zero volatile organic compounds (VOC), ensuring no unpleasant chemical odors during use.

**Performance That Lives Up to the Hype**

My coffee maker hadn’t been descaled in months, and it had noticeably slowed down. This product breathed new life into it after just one use, delivering water flow as smooth as when it was new. My dishwasher, infamous for leaving residue, also benefited, with cleaner washes and sparkling results that I hadn’t seen in a while. The descaler’s NSF/ANSI 60 certification reassured me of its quality, and it’s comforting to know it can be safely used for potable water systems.

**Downsides**

- While the non-corrosive formula is superbly safe, you may need to repeat the descaling process for severely neglected appliances.
- The lack of a measuring cap can make pouring the exact amount a bit tricky, especially for smaller appliances.
- Not specifically designed for extremely hard water regions, though it still works decently.

**How it Stands Against Market Rivals**

I’ve tried similar products like CLR and vinegar solutions in the past. While vinegar is economical and natural, it often leaves a lingering odor that I’m not a fan of, and CLR, though effective, felt too harsh and required extreme caution. J.C. Whitlam’s descaler finds a perfect middle ground—gentle, odor-free, and effective. It might be pricier than DIY methods, but the added convenience and certified safety make it a worthwhile choice.

**Cost Efficiency**

In my opinion, this descaler offers solid value for money given its performance and eco-conscious features. Other solutions may cost less upfront, but the peace of mind from using a safer, environmentally friendly product feels worth it. For households like mine that frequently rely on appliances, this investment ensures efficiency and extended lifespan, ultimately saving costs in the long run.

We met in middle school and have a pretty strong bond. We text each other everyday, always rely on each other when we need help, and try to meet as much as we can (even though it’s always me who takes the initiative, but anyways…).

I’ve been getting gifts for her birthdays every year without a fail for 5 years now, but it only hit me recently that I’ve never gotten anything from her. Worst part is that I’ve always tried giving her meaningful things: A vinyl record of her favorite artist, jewelry that she likes, a tea set from Japan as she loves tea,  set of silk pyjamas… you name it. 
I’ve never received anything at all. I obviously didn’t gift all these things to her because I wanted something back, it just brought me joy to see her enjoy the presents. What hurts me is that I feel like she doesn’t care about me. I don’t need anything expensive, even a letter, a card, or a trip to our favorite coffee place would’ve been meaningful, it feels like I’m not worth the effort.

1n2gvtx,https://i.redd.it/6fq66vdm9slf1.png,[Rum Review #173] Diplomático Distillery Collection #3,"Despite Diplomático originally being a Venezuelan brand (now a part of Brown Forman), there have been Diplomático products that haven't been launched in Venezuela, or some that were initially launched elsewhere and, eventually, in Venezuela. The Distillery Collection never made it to Venezuela and among the three of the edition, this #3 is the only one I've tried, but I've heard from many that it's the best of all.

The Distillery Collection was released in 2017 to highlight the two fundamental pillars of the rums that make up Reserva Exclusiva and Mantuano. In 2017, the #1 and #2 rums were launched, while the #3 was released in 2019.

Without going into too much detail about their differences, both the #1 and #3 stills contain pot-distilled rum, while the #2 contains column-distilled rum. The main difference between the #1 and #3 is the type of still used, with the #1 being batch kettle and aged for six years, and the #3 using pot still and aged for eight years in ex-bourbon barrels and bottled at 47% ABV. Like all the bottles in this series, this one is numbered and is 4594 of 5000, with a distillation date of June 2010.

Made by: Destilerías Unidas SA  
Name of the rum: Distillery Collection #3 Pot Still Rum  
Brand: Diplomático  
Origin: Venezuela  
Age: 8 years (though some sites claim it's a blend of *up to* 8 years)

**Nose:** The nose highlights aromas I associate with sweetness, such as banana, strawberry jam, dried figs, and toffee. A few minutes in the glass and there are more fruity aromas, mostly of plums, and some caramel. Finally, there's some leather, sawdust, something that reminds me of Kahlúa coffee liqueur, and a hint of cinnamon.

**Palate:** On the palate, I'm mainly surprised by the fact that it's not as sweet as the Reserva Exclusiva... in fact, it's not sweet at all. It includes strong notes of dark chocolate, pepper, caramel, and mango. Secondarily, some toasted wood, tobacco, pineapple, vanilla, and a hint of pepperoncino. None of the flavors are overly intense; rather, each one carries the same intensity throughout the flavor.

**Retrohale/Finish:** Toffee and banana.

**Rating:** 8 on the t8ke

**Conclusion:** Being a product that comes from a pot still, I expected a bit more intensity in its flavors and not something so subtle, but that's Venezuelan rum. Perhaps one issue is that having tried rums from other countries makes you realize how varied rum, its distillation, and aging can be. Reserva Exclusiva has a large majority of this rum in its blend, and if it weren't for the sugar in the RE, its flavor might be more closely related to it. Although I'm not the biggest fan of that sweet intensity, there's no doubt it's served them well, and that's why they're among the best-selling rums in the world.

If the RE were more like this one, I'd probably like it more. But it also happens that the RE costs half as much as this one.



English is not my first language and most of my reviews have been posted originally in Spanish, and later translated into English, so I apologize if they sometimes sound *mechanical*. On reddit I'm aiming to review mostly Venezuelan rums, but I post a bit of everything. You can check out the rest of my reviews (in Spanish) on [my blog](https://humoytabaco.com/), including rum, whisk(e)y, agave, gin and cigars.

🌟 **The Uncomfortable Truth About Success**

Ever wonder why some incredibly gifted people crash and burn while others with seemingly average abilities rise to the top? The answer might surprise you – and it has nothing to do with how smart you are or what natural gifts you possess.

## 🎯 The Great Myth We're All Sold

We live in a world obsessed with talent. Social media feeds overflow with child prodigies, instant sensations, and overnight success stories. We're constantly told that if you're born with ""it"" – whatever ""it"" is – you're destined for greatness.

But here's what nobody talks about: **raw ability is just the starting line, not the finish line.**

Think about it. How many brilliant students from your school ended up doing nothing remarkable with their lives? How many ""most likely to succeed"" yearbook predictions turned into cautionary tales instead of success stories?

## 🔥 The Three Pillars That Actually Matter

### 1. Self-Control: Your Internal CEO 👑

Self-control isn't about being rigid or joyless. It's about becoming the CEO of your own life instead of letting impulses run the show.

**Daily Applications:**
- Wake up when your alarm goes off (not after hitting snooze five times)
- Finish tasks before starting new ones
- Choose long-term benefits over immediate gratification
- Stick to commitments you make to yourself
- Say no to distractions that derail your focus

**Real-World Impact:** The person who can control their impulses controls their destiny. While others are scrolling social media, you're building skills. While others are making excuses, you're making progress.

### 2. Commitment: The Compound Interest of Life 📈

Dedication isn't glamorous. It's showing up on days when you don't feel like it. It's continuing when the initial excitement wears off and the real work begins.

**Daily Applications:**
- Practice your craft even when motivation is low
- Keep learning new skills related to your goals
- Maintain consistent routines that support your objectives
- Push through the ""messy middle"" of any project
- View setbacks as data, not defeats

**Real-World Impact:** Consistent daily actions compound over time. A person who improves 1% each day ends up 37 times better by year's end. That's the mathematics of dedication.

### 3. Integrity: Your Personal Operating System 🧭

Your values and principles form the operating system that runs your life. Without strong values, even the most talented person becomes unreliable, untrustworthy, and ultimately unsuccessful.

**Daily Applications:**
- Keep your word, especially to yourself
- Take responsibility for your mistakes
- Treat people fairly regardless of their status
- Make decisions based on principles, not convenience
- Be honest about your limitations and work to overcome them

**Real-World Impact:** People with strong values become magnets for opportunities because others trust them. Trust is the currency of all meaningful relationships and business dealings.

## 🚫 Why Natural Ability Falls Short

Natural ability creates a dangerous trap: **early success without effort**. When things come easily, you never develop the mental muscles needed for real challenges.

Consider these scenarios:
- The naturally gifted athlete who never learned to push through pain
- The brilliant student who never developed study habits
- The charming salesperson who never learned to handle rejection
- The creative genius who never learned to finish projects

When these people hit their first real obstacle, they crumble. They've never built the internal strength to persist through difficulty.

## 💪 Building Your Success Foundation

### Start Small, Think Big
Don't try to transform your entire life overnight. Pick one small habit and master it completely before adding another.

**Examples:**
- Make your bed every morning for 30 days
- Read 10 pages of a book daily
- Exercise for 15 minutes each day
- Write down three things you're grateful for

### Create Systems, Not Goals
Goals are what you want to achieve. Systems are what you do consistently to achieve them.

**Instead of:** ""I want to lose 20 pounds""
**Try:** ""I will walk 10,000 steps every day""

**Instead of:** ""I want to start a business""
**Try:** ""I will spend one hour daily learning about entrepreneurship""

### Embrace the Grind 🔧
The most successful people learn to find satisfaction in the process, not just the outcomes. They understand that excellence is a daily practice, not a destination.

## 🏆 The Long Game Advantage

In a world of quick fixes and instant gratification, the person willing to play the long game has an enormous advantage. While others jump from opportunity to opportunity, you're building something substantial.

**The Compound Effect in Action:**
- Year 1: You're behind because you're learning fundamentals
- Year 3: You're catching up because your foundation is solid
- Year 5: You're ahead because others have quit or switched directions
- Year 10: You're unbeatable because you've become excellent

## 🎨 Redefining Success

True success isn't about being the most talented person in the room. It's about being the most reliable, consistent, and principled person in the room.

**Signs You're Building Real Success:**
- People seek your advice
- You're known for following through
- Challenges excite rather than intimidate you
- You measure progress in years, not days
- Your reputation precedes you

## 🌱 The Growth Mindset Edge

People with strong values view challenges as opportunities to grow rather than threats to their ego. They understand that:

- Failure is feedback, not a verdict
- Skills can be developed through effort
- Persistence beats perfection every time
- Today's struggles become tomorrow's strengths

## 🔄 Daily Practices for Character Building

### Morning Rituals
Start each day by doing something difficult before you do anything fun. This trains your mind to lead with discipline.

### Evening Reviews
Before bed, ask yourself:
- Did I keep my commitments today?
- What did I learn?
- How can I improve tomorrow?
- Did my actions align with my values?

### Weekly Planning
Every week, identify:
- One skill to develop
- One relationship to strengthen
- One challenge to overcome
- One way to contribute to others

## 🎯 The Practical Path Forward

### Month 1-3: Foundation Building
- Choose one keystone habit and master it
- Eliminate one major distraction from your life
- Begin each day with a challenging task
- Track your consistency, not your results

### Month 4-6: Skill Development
- Identify the top three skills needed for your goals
- Dedicate daily time to deliberate practice
- Seek feedback from people better than you
- Document your learning journey

### Month 7-12: Character Integration
- Take on projects that test your persistence
- Volunteer or help others without expecting returns
- Make difficult decisions based on your values
- Build relationships with other principled people

## 🌍 Why This Matters More Than Ever

In our rapidly changing world, the only constant is change itself. Technical skills become obsolete. Industries transform overnight. But the fundamentals of human excellence – discipline, dedication, and values – remain eternally relevant.

The person who builds these qualities becomes adaptable, resilient, and valuable in any era or industry.

## ⚡ The Ripple Effect

When you commit to developing these qualities, you don't just change your own life. You become a positive influence on everyone around you:

- Your family sees what consistent effort looks like
- Your colleagues learn to trust your reliability
- Your friends are inspired by your growth
- Your community benefits from your contributions

## 🎪 Breaking Free from the Talent Trap

The greatest gift you can give yourself is freedom from the myth that you need special gifts to succeed. This belief keeps millions of people waiting for permission to start, hoping for luck to strike, or making excuses for why others succeed while they don't.

**The liberating truth:** Excellence is available to anyone willing to do the work consistently over time.

## 🛠️ Your Personal Development Toolkit

### Daily Questions
- What's the most important thing I need to do today?
- Am I acting from discipline or impulse?
- How can I add value to someone else's life?
- What would the person I want to become do right now?

### Weekly Challenges
- Learn something completely new
- Have a difficult conversation you've been avoiding
- Help someone without them asking
- Do something that scares you a little

### Monthly Reviews
- Are my actions aligned with my stated goals?
- What patterns am I seeing in my behavior?
- Where am I making excuses instead of progress?
- How have I grown compared to last month?

## 🎊 The Ultimate Success Formula

Here's the formula that outlasts all trends, technologies, and changes:

**Consistent Daily Actions + Time + Persistence = Extraordinary Results**

It's not sexy. It's not instant. But it's guaranteed to work if you work it.

## 🌈 Your New Beginning

Today is the perfect day to start building the life you want through the person you choose to become. You don't need permission, special talents, or perfect conditions.

You just need to begin.

Start small. Stay consistent. Trust the process.

Your future self is counting on the choices you make today.

Remember: **The world is full of talented people who never reached their potential. Don't let that be your story.**

---

*The journey of building excellence through values and consistency is one of the most rewarding adventures you can embark upon. Every day offers a new chance to choose growth over comfort, action over excuses, and principles over convenience. Your success story starts with today's choices.*

I have been using a generic backpack for my EDC & carry-on for a long time, and it has gotten to the point that it's cumbersome, unwieldy, and annoying. I'm looking to upgrade and pretty sold on Evergoods, but I am struggling to identify which bag will fit my needs. Looking for those with experience to provide some guidance, if you would be so kind. 

I've used the search function to read a few past examples of these, but would appreciate someone looking over my specific usecase, because each of the ones I read were just different enough that I have questions.

I have three main use-cases, in order of frequency/importance

**EDC**  
I plan to use it for Every day carry to work. I don't carry a ton, but what I bring now doesn't have a great system, and has sprawled into unwieldy annoyance, since my current backpack has no tumbler side pocket.

* 16 inch laptop
* Gym clothes (shoes, shirt, shorts/joggers)
* 1L Yeti water bottle
* Yeti coffee tumbler
* Loosely packed lunch in a reusable Lulu bag (probably need to upgrade to a real lunch container soon)
* Occasionally a book for commute reading/lunches
* Slight admin stuff (pens, paper pads, etc.)

  
**Outings with Family & Day Events**

Plan to use it for outings with my family, including under 1-year old, occasional biking or hiking on manicured paths. Or to bring board games/ magic material to events hosted at friends. Plan to use as partial diaper bag for a bit, though my wife will have a dedicated diaper bag herself.

  
**Short Work Travel & Carry-on for Personal Travel**

I take a number of work trips \~3-5 per year that are each 2 to 5 days. I currently just stuff my existing backpack, and bring a roller suitcase. I'd love to get this down to just the carry on bag for some trips, but not opposed to bringing the roller suitcase for longer trips.



**Targeted Thoughts & Questions**

* Given the EDC load, what size would be ideal?
* I really like the full zip feature of the CTB, but I worry even small CTB is overkill for EDC, is it?
* I am 6'2 does that impact what size I should be looking for / at?
* Will the Yeti's fit into the side compartments of smaller bags / are they uncomfortable using loop attachments?
* Is it unrealistic to get something that is ideal for all of these use-cases, and I should just settle for suboptimal on short travel?
* Anything else I should be considering before purchase that you wish you had known?

1n2gsk8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewedForYou/comments/1n2gsk8/investigate_why_the_fuller_724_upholstery_cleaner/,Investigate Why the Fuller 724 Upholstery Cleaner Gets Rave Reviews,"Testing the Fuller 724 upholstery cleaner felt like diving into a battlefield of stains and odors that had been haunting my household for what seemed like ages. From the moment I grabbed the can, I could tell it wasn’t just about good marketing; this cleaner had potential. I mean, who wouldn’t want to rejuvenate their upholstery without dragging out a carpet cleaner or setting aside an entire afternoon? Fuller 724 promises to handle stains with ease, and after reading pages of glowing reviews boasting a robust 4.4-star rating, I had to see if those claims held water—or foam, in this case.

**Design and Ease of Use**  
A sleek, lightweight can with an easy-to-use spray nozzle is what you get here. The application process is almost laughably simple. I don’t have the patience for complicated setups, so the fact that I could spray it directly onto my stained couch cushions and rugs without needing anything fancy was a relief. The multi-surface capability is highlighted on the packaging, and it boldly claims to work on everything from velour to vinyl. Trusting that claim, I used it on a fabric armchair, a velvet pillow I had written off, and even some automotive upholstery in my car.  

[Find the best price for Fuller 724 on Amazon.](https://reviews.sanue.com/p/b00n37snfg/)  

**Performance**  
Right out of the gate, the foamy formula felt satisfying. It doesn't seep deeply into the fabric to the point of soaking it, which I appreciated because nobody wants to wait hours for their couch to dry. After spraying, I let it sit for those 30 seconds they recommend. Then came the surprise—the foam clings just enough to break down those stubborn marks. Blotting it with a damp cloth, the stains didn’t vanish like magic, but there was tangible improvement. On old coffee stains and remnants of my dog's muddy paws, it did better than I expected. That being said, stronger blotting or brushing is helpful for truly stubborn stains. Fuller’s Stain Brush would probably help, but I skipped it and used a soft-bristle brush from my bathroom. Worked fine!

**Pros**  
• Versatile application across different materials, from couches to carpets and even car interiors.  
• Leaves no sticky residues; the surface feels clean and refreshed.  
• Simple, no-rinse formula cuts down cleaning time significantly.  

**Negatives**  
• Relatively mild for older, deeply entrenched stains—requires additional scrubbing or multiple applications.  
• The nozzle spray isn’t 100% even; sometimes a little overspray happens.  

**Benefits**  
If there’s one thing clear, this upholstery cleaner shines best on day-to-day messes—spilled coffee, dusty armchair corners, or that weird patch on the carpet you’re hoping nobody notices. Space efficiency also scores major points for me as it fits easily under the sink among other cleaning products.

**Alternative Products**  
Products like Woolite Instaclean or Resolve are common alternatives for upholstery cleaning, and I’ve dabbled with both in the past. Comparatively, Fuller 724 is less aggressive in its cleaning but also less invasive since it doesn’t saturate fabric. I find that minor spills and surface-level stains look better after using Fuller, mainly because it doesn’t leave that faint chemical odor behind like some others do. Woolite might have an edge for treating larger carpeted areas, but it’s bulkier and messier for isolated tasks.

**Money’s Worth**  
Given its multifunctionality and how little you need to use per cleaning session, Fuller 724 offers great bang for the buck. You’re essentially buying a product that not only saves money on professional cleanings but also prolongs the lifecycle of upholstery that’s suffered regular wear and tear. Its ease of use and lack of residue make it a practical tool for anyone juggling kids, pets, or general household mess.

1n2gsil,https://i.redd.it/ewyg5lb9dslf1.jpeg,KTT Bank Transfer vs. Wise (TransferWise) for receiving international payments?,"
Hey everyone,

I’ve been freelancing for international clients for the better part of five years now, and if there’s one thing that’s always a headache, it’s getting paid. Seriously, navigating international payments can feel like deciphering ancient hieroglyphics.

Lately, I’ve been getting a ton of questions about [KTT Bank Transfers](https://kttreceiving.com), especially from clients who prefer that method. Having also used Wise (formerly TransferWise) for ages, I figured it was time to put them head-to-head. So, grab a coffee, and let’s break down these two options for **receiving international payments** based on my real-world experience.

## **My Situation: Why I've Had to Use Both Systems**

It all started when my biggest client, based in Hong Kong, insisted on paying via a **KTT Bank Transfer**. I’ll be honest, I’d never heard of it before. My go-to had always been Wise because it’s what all the online forums talk about. I was nervous about delays, complex codes, and whether the money would even arrive.

But, a client willing to pay on time is a client worth keeping happy, right? So, I did my homework. I found a great resource that explained the process in plain English over at **[KTT Bank Transfer](https://kttreceiving.com)**. It demystified the whole thing and gave me the confidence to proceed. After successfully receiving a few payments via KTT, I felt I had a solid basis to compare it to my old faithful, Wise.

## **The Speed Showdown: Which One Gets You Paid Faster?**

This is usually the first question on everyone's mind: ""How long until the money is in my pocket?""

*   **Wise:** The speed here is consistently impressive. Once the sender initiates the transfer, it typically lands in my Wise account within 1-2 business days. The beauty is that once it’s there, I can convert it to my local currency instantly and then send it to my local bank account, which takes another day. So, call it **2-3 days end-to-end**. Their tracking is super transparent, which eliminates anxiety.

*   **KTT Bank Transfer:** This one is a bit more of a traditional bank wire. The processing time isn't instant; it operates on banking hours and can be affected by intermediaries. In my experience, from the moment the client sends it, it takes **2-4 business days** to show up in my account. It’s not lightning fast, but it’s perfectly reliable and within the standard window for international wires.

**The Takeaway:** If you need predictability and a modern, app-based tracking system, **Wise is faster**. But if your client is sending the payment and you’re not in a desperate rush, **KTT is perfectly acceptable**.

## **The Cost Breakdown: Fees You Can't Afford to Ignore**

Fees are where you can really win or lose. Every dollar counts.

*   **Wise:** Their model is famous for its transparency. They show you the fee upfront, and it’s usually a percentage of the transfer amount. They also use the real mid-market exchange rate, which is a huge plus. As the receiver, I don’t pay a fee to *receive* the money into my Wise account. However, if I need to convert it or send it to my bank, those fees apply.

*   **KTT Bank Transfer:** This is where KTT can sometimes surprise you. The fees can be lower on the sending side for your client, especially if they are using a bank that has favorable terms for these types of transfers. As the receiver, I’ve had transactions where I received the full amount with no deduction, and others where my bank charged a small incoming wire fee ($10-$15). It’s crucial to check with your own bank about their policy.

**The Takeaway:** **Wise is more predictable** with fees. **KTT has the potential to be cheaper** overall, but you need to do your homework on both ends to avoid surprise correspondent bank fees.

## **Ease of Use: Which One Makes Your Life Easier?**

*   **Wise:** It’s incredibly user-friendly. You get your own local bank details in multiple currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, etc.), which you can just email to your client. The entire process feels modern and seamless.

*   **KTT Bank Transfer:** This is a more traditional process. You need to provide your client with a specific set of banking details: your account number, the SWIFT/BIC code, and potentially other codes like a Beneficiary Code or Clearing Code. It can feel a bit daunting at first. I highly recommend checking a guide like the one on **https://kttreceiving.com** to ensure you give your sender the correct information to prevent any delays.

**The Takeaway:** **Wise wins on pure, effortless ease of use.** KTT requires a bit more manual work and double-checking from you, the receiver.

## **The Big Question: Is KTT Actually Safe and Reliable?**

Whenever a financial system isn't as widely discussed as Wise, this is a valid concern. Based on my experience:

Yes, a **KTT Bank Transfer** is a legitimate and secure method of bank-to-bank transfer. It’s not a shady off-the-books system; it’s a recognized telegraphic transfer method. The reliability is on par with any other international wire—it follows banking protocols and security measures. The key to a smooth experience is ensuring all the information you provide to the sender is 100% accurate. I’ve received multiple payments via KTT without a single security issue.

## **My Verdict: Who Should Use Which?**

So, after all this, which one should you choose?

*   **Choose Wise if:** You value speed, transparency, and a completely streamlined, digital experience. It’s perfect for freelancers, digital nomads, and anyone who receives frequent, smaller payments from multiple countries.

*   **Choose a KTT Bank Transfer if:** Your client prefers or insists on using it (always keep the client happy!), or if the fee structure works out cheaper for your specific situation. It’s a solid, reliable method for receiving larger payments, especially from certain regions.

Honestly, having both options in your toolkit is a win. You’re not stuck saying ""no"" to a client because of their preferred payment method. Understanding how to receive a [KTT Bank Transfer](https://kttreceiving.com) has definitely made my business more flexible.

## **What About You? What's Your Experience?**

Alright, that’s my two cents! But I want to hear from you all.

*   Have you received a payment via KTT? How was your experience?
*   Did you get hit with any unexpected fees?
*   Do you have another preferred method for **receiving international payments** that blows both of these out of the water?

Hey Everyone, 
A little about me first, I’m 23M from Blr, and I had one simple question-  what’s the next step in my coffee journey ?
So I’m someone who drinks an iced latte 95% of the time. Yes, I like my coffee with milk and a little sugar. I drink espresso-based iced lattes from BlueTokai, Thirdwave, and other cafes a couple of times a week, but the rest of the days I make it at home using instant coffee. 
Over the last couple of years, I’ve been using either Davidoff or nescafe gold. Which last me a month per 100g ( ₹600-700 a month ). I wanted to step things up from instant coffee.
I tried Zenma frozen espresso. Yes, it was different, but it didn’t hit the same as a café coffee. 
What should I purchase next ? Should I get a portable espresso maker like the Finero Mini or a budget machine like the Finero Next, or should I save up for a couple of years to invest in a proper, decent espresso maker?

I feel exhausted all the time so I’m taking a break from lifting 5 days a week but started looking at my sleep data to see if I could find patterns or answers about WHY I feel tired all day most days.

Looking at the data my Apple Watch ultra2 collects it seems like I’m way low on the Deep and REM sleep stages and always surpass the Core sleep needs. ChatGPT suggest 90-120minutes REM, 60-100 minutes Deep, and 3-5hrs Core sleep. I know the Apple Watch isn’t super accurate for Deep sleep but if it’s only showing I’m getting 9 minutes of it when I slept for almost 8.5 hrs last night I’m leaning towards thinking it might be close to accurate given how run down I feel. I have a CPAP (mild sleep apnea diagnosis before I lost 35lbs last year) but sleep even with the CPAP my watch still shows I get the same low 1/3 or 1/2 of the needed Deep and REM sleep stages I normally get without the CPAP (same results with and without the CPAP basically). I sleep in a dark 66 degree room, no noise, same general bedtime and wake time. If I am asleep for 8 hours why isn’t my body dipping into the REM and Deep sleep enough? I recently switched from magnesium citrate to magnesium bisglycinate before bed. Two days ago I stopped taking ashwagandha twice daily (morning and before bed with magnesium citrate) to see if it helped resolve my tired feelings.",3,1756397983.0,sleep,3,1.0,False

*Building Character in a World of Distractions*

## Introduction: What Does It Mean to Be Authentic Today? 🤔

In our fast-paced digital age, the definition of what makes someone genuinely mature and respected has become clouded by social media trends, instant gratification, and superficial measurements of success. This guide explores practical principles for living with integrity and building meaningful relationships that stand the test of time.

---

## 🎯 Chapter 1: The Power of Focus and Commitment

### Single-Minded Dedication Creates Success

Just as successful entrepreneurs focus on one business venture at a time to maximize their impact, applying the same principle to personal relationships yields remarkable results. When you channel your emotional energy toward one meaningful connection, you create depth rather than spreading yourself thin across multiple shallow interactions.

**Daily Action Steps:**
- Invest quality time in conversations that matter
- Practice active listening without phone distractions
- Show up consistently for the people who count on you
- Prioritize emotional availability over quantity of connections

---

## 🧠 Chapter 2: Mind Over Impulse - Making Rational Decisions

### Your Brain is Your Best Asset

Every day, we face countless decisions driven by immediate desires versus long-term benefits. Research shows that people who can delay gratification and think beyond the moment consistently achieve better outcomes in career, health, and relationships.

**Practical Implementation:**
- Pause for 10 seconds before making impulsive decisions
- Ask yourself: ""Will this matter in 5 years?""
- Create a personal mission statement to guide choices
- Develop hobbies that require patience and skill-building

---

## 👁️ Chapter 3: Looking Beyond Surface Appearances

### Substance Over Style in All Life Choices

Our society bombards us with image-focused messaging, from advertising to social platforms. However, lasting satisfaction comes from connections and choices based on character, compatibility, and shared values rather than external attributes.

**Real-World Applications:**
- When meeting new people, focus on their actions and values
- Choose friends who inspire you to grow, not just entertain you
- In professional settings, seek mentors based on wisdom, not just success metrics
- Make purchasing decisions based on utility and quality, not just aesthetics

---

## 🤝 Chapter 4: The Art of Balanced Relationships

### Mutual Respect Creates Lasting Bonds

Healthy relationships require a delicate balance of independence and interdependence. Whether in romantic partnerships, friendships, or professional collaborations, the most successful connections involve two complete individuals who choose to enhance each other's lives.

**Building Better Connections:**
- Maintain your individual interests and goals
- Express appreciation regularly and specifically
- Communicate needs clearly without demanding compliance
- Celebrate your partner's/friend's achievements enthusiastically
- Create shared experiences while respecting personal space

---

## 🌱 Chapter 5: Quality Over Quantity in All Areas

### Depth Beats Breadth Every Time

In networking, friendships, skills, and experiences, focusing on developing fewer, higher-quality connections and competencies leads to greater satisfaction and success than trying to do everything.

**Strategic Living:**
- Master 2-3 skills deeply rather than dabbling in many
- Cultivate 5-10 close relationships instead of 100 acquaintances
- Choose experiences that align with your core values
- Invest in quality items that last rather than constant replacements

---

## 💼 Chapter 6: Performance vs. Character

### Skills Get You Noticed, Character Gets You Respected

While being competent in your abilities matters, true respect comes from how you handle challenges, treat others during difficult times, and maintain your principles when tested.

**Character-Building Actions:**
- Keep commitments even when it's inconvenient
- Admit mistakes quickly and work to correct them
- Help others without expecting immediate returns
- Stay consistent in your behavior regardless of who's watching
- Take responsibility for outcomes in your sphere of influence

---

## 💝 Chapter 7: Recognizing and Valuing Support

### Appreciation Multiplies What You Already Have

When someone invests their time, energy, or resources in your success, acknowledging this investment strengthens the relationship and often leads to even greater support in the future.

**Showing Genuine Gratitude:**
- Send handwritten thank-you notes for significant help
- Remember and mention specific ways people have supported you
- Look for opportunities to reciprocate assistance
- Publicly acknowledge those who've contributed to your achievements
- Make time for people who've made time for you

---

## 🏆 Chapter 8: Building a Legacy Worth Celebrating

### What Gets Remembered After You're Gone

Society recognizes individuals who create value, solve problems, and contribute positively to their communities. These achievements create lasting impact and fulfillment far beyond temporary pleasures or superficial accomplishments.

**Legacy-Building Activities:**
- Develop expertise that helps others solve real problems
- Mentor someone younger or less experienced
- Create something useful that outlasts your direct involvement
- Build systems and processes that benefit your team or community
- Document your knowledge for future generations
- Contribute to causes larger than your immediate interests

---

## 🔑 Chapter 9: The Three Pillars of Authentic Living

### Honesty, Loyalty, and Faithfulness as Life Foundations

These three principles form the bedrock of all meaningful relationships and sustainable success. They're not just moral guidelines but practical strategies for building trust and credibility.

**Living the Pillars Daily:**

**Honesty:**
- Tell the truth even when it's uncomfortable
- Admit when you don't know something
- Give accurate progress reports on projects
- Provide constructive feedback with kindness

**Loyalty:**
- Stand by friends during their difficult periods
- Defend absent team members when they're being criticized unfairly
- Keep confidential information private
- Support your organization's mission even when facing challenges

**Faithfulness:**
- Follow through on all commitments, large and small
- Maintain consistent behavior regardless of mood or circumstances
- Keep your word even when situations change
- Show up reliably for both planned events and unexpected needs

---

## 🌟 Chapter 10: Practical Daily Implementation

### Making These Principles Automatic

Transformation happens through small, consistent actions rather than dramatic gestures. Here's how to integrate these concepts into your routine:

**Morning Routine:**
- Start each day by reviewing your core values
- Set three specific intentions for how you'll demonstrate character
- Practice gratitude by identifying someone who's supported you recently

**Throughout the Day:**
- Before major decisions, ask: ""Does this align with who I want to become?""
- When facing conflict, choose response over reaction
- Look for opportunities to add value to others' lives

**Evening Reflection:**
- Review moments where you lived up to your principles
- Identify areas for improvement without harsh self-judgment
- Plan specific actions to strengthen important relationships

---

## 📈 Measuring Your Progress

### Tracking Character Growth

Unlike measuring income or physical fitness, character development requires different metrics:

- **Relationship Quality:** Do people seek your advice and trust your judgment?
- **Consistency:** Are you the same person in public and private?
- **Impact:** Are you solving problems and creating value for others?
- **Peace of Mind:** Do you sleep well knowing you've acted with integrity?
- **Future Focus:** Are your current actions building the life you want in 10 years?

---

## 🚀 Moving Forward: Your Next Steps

The journey toward authentic living isn't about perfection—it's about consistent improvement and conscious choices. Every day presents new opportunities to apply these principles and build the character that creates lasting satisfaction and meaningful impact.

**This Week's Challenge:**
1. Choose one relationship to invest in more deeply
2. Identify one area where you can improve your consistency
3. Find one way to add value to your community
4. Practice pausing before making impulse-driven decisions
5. Express genuine appreciation to someone who's supported you

Remember: these principles aren't just personal development concepts—they're practical strategies for creating the kind of life and relationships that provide deep satisfaction and lasting impact. The world needs more people who choose substance over flash, character over convenience, and long-term thinking over instant gratification.

Your future self will thank you for the choices you make today. 🌅

When we first met then later he decided to come to visit me in my country cause he wanted us to build a relationship, I was unemployed at that time. He was the one who decided to come and also suggested we do a trip together to the neighboring country. He asked me to join and I said yes, and I paid for our bus tickets (it was easier for me since I had access to the booking platform) He covered the hotel and most meals. I bought some of our coffees and drinks cause I couldn’t afford more as I was unemployed. But during that trip, he made a comment I hated something like: “Oh wow, these photos you took of me are amazing, so all the restaurants I paid for were worth it.” It made me feel really uncomfortable, like the money he spent had to be “justified.”

Then, a month later, he wanted me to travel spend Christmas with him. At first, I told him I couldn’t because I didn’t have a job yet and I wanted to focus on finding one. He got sad and offended, saying our relationship wouldn’t work if we didn’t do trips together. And he offered to pay for my ticket so I go, but then told me I should cover my return flight because he wanted to “see effort” from me. Even though I was still unemployed with very little savings I agreed and paid for it cause it sounded fair even though it was hard for me financially. 

Fast-forward: I finally got a job, but I still earn about 3–4 times less than he does. When I visited him in his country which was again a mutual decision, I paid for my plane ticket which was almost half my salary and he said, “Don’t worry, once you’re here you won’t need to think about other expenses.” He did pay majority of our meals and restaurant bills but while I was there, he still asked me things like: “Can you cover this meal?” or “Would you pay for my drink?” It feels like he sometimes sees me as if I don’t pay anything and just want to be provided for, even though I literally gave away half my salary just to be there. Meanwhile, for him, that same trip in total cost a much smaller percentage of his income

I don’t expect him to pay for everything, but I feel like he doesn’t see the imbalance. He makes several times what I make, but I go beyond my means to make it work with the trips and don’t manage to save, while he even though mathematically spending more doesn’t sacrifice nearly as much as I do. I do try to show appreciation for what he covers: I cook for him when I visit, plan things for us to do, do the dishes and I always bring or send him thoughtful gifts. He even tells me I’m the most thoughtful girlfriend he’s ever had when it comes to gifts. I really try to contribute in every way I can, but sometimes it still feels like he doesn’t notice how much I’m already putting in.

What really worries me isn’t the money itself, but the lack of consideration for my situation. It makes me question whether I want to commit long-term, marriage, family, a future together with someone who doesn’t always show that kind of thoughtfulness. 

I would really love to hear some outside thoughts on this and also I wonder how do I bring this up to him in a way that shows I don’t expect a provider, but just want more consideration for our different situations? ",22,1756397956.0,TwoXChromosomes,46,0.74,False

I’m planning a quick 7‑hour Saturday trip to Düsseldorf and wanted to see if this plan makes sense. I will be travelling from Eindhoven 

- Arrive at Central Bus Station around 11.  
- Little Tokyo for breakfast/brunch, browse Japanese shops, maybe pop into EKo‑Haus if open.  
- Altstadt walk - Marktplatz, St. Lambertus, Schlossturm, cobblestone streets, maybe an Altbier at Brauerei Zum Schlüssel.  
- Rhine Promenade stroll toward MediaHarbor - riverside views, Gehry buildings, lunch somewhere casual.  
- Short look around MediaHarbor’s architecture and marina.  
- Head up the Rhine Tower for city views (book ahead).  
- Quick wander through Hofgarten and Königsallee - green space and window shopping.  
- Back to Altstadt for coffee/souvenir, then walk to bus station.

Aiming to keep it walkable, low‑cost (Rhine Tower as the main paid attraction). 

Does this seem like a good flow for a first‑time visit? Any tweaks or must‑sees I’m missing?

I have a drink I get because it’s addicting but there’s a new girl who was working along side someone who’s worked there for a while. The new girl made my drink wrong she put boba in it even though I didn’t ask for it. Wasn’t what was in the drink at all. I asked for it to be remade politely because I paid for what I asked for. Nothing to it. 

But the girl who’s worked there for awhile said just strain out the boba and add extra ice and milk. I got in the car and told my partner that it was a little upsetting because now my drink just taste like boba. I’m not tripping over it but it is upsetting. My partner said they shouldn’t have done that and they should’ve remade the drink. Is this the normal thing to do or should they have remade the drink?
