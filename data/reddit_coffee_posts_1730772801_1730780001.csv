Literally, Vanilla and if you're lucky, Chocolate. There used to be a good cookies and cream that was sold at Safeway but I don't see it any more. Occasionally you'll find different flavors but always under the same circumstances. 
•Very Expensive. 
•Very Small
•Same 10 flavors that rotate, only a few of which are decent. 

And don't get me started on Sugar Free Coffee Creamer! French Vanilla (Noticing a pattern here) and Hazelnut are IT for the sugar free most of the time. Walmart o casionally gets the seasonal flavors and I saw they had Italian Sweet Cream in SF as well. But That's a very recent find. I got the Pumpkin Pie Spice flavor. It's decent. But like over 4 bucks for one container.

After a small dinner in a … a fairly empty mess hall if we’re being honest, I made my way towards Triwt’s room.

“Let’s see… She said it was down this hall?” I openly ask myself as I look down the hall. Despite the foot traffic of much larger species walking around me, they are surprisingly aware of my presence and are actively trying to not bump into me.

*Is this a normal thing when dealing with smaller species or is this a ‘Oh god, a human is here walking among us’ thing?*

*Only way to find out is to ask somebody.* 

*That and you aren’t even sure this is the right hallway.*

*These halls all look the same, save for decorated room doors and signs…*

I let out a little sigh under my breath and looked up at a person that was walking somewhat towards me.

“Um, excuse me?”

They look down at me, with a slightly amused look on their face. “Yes, little one? Are you lost by chance?”

*Okay, very feminine voice and it seems they believe me to be a child.*

“Just two quick questions, actually. I don’t wanna take up too much of your time.”

“Oh don’t worry, dear. Feel free to ask me anything.”

“I noticed that a lot of people around here have a tendency to… I wouldn’t say avoid me, but more actively try to not get too close. Is this simply because I’m short in comparison or because I’m a new person?”

“Oh, it’s probably a mix of both. When you’re much larger than some others, you have to be mindful of those smaller than you. You don’t wanna accidentally hurt anyone, big or small.”

“That’s fair, I just feel a little… isolated. I mean, I have some people who I’ve been spending time with and they’ve been helping me a lot, but when they aren’t around…”

“I think I understand, dear.”

*Either she still thinks I’m a child or this is just how she talks to everyone.*

*So long as she isn’t figuratively talking down to us. Because in every physical manner, almost everyone is, besides maybe Lys, literally talking down to you.*

“Thank you for that.”

“What was your other question?”

“Oh right! Um, my living quarters, or is it just room? Either way, my living quarters hasn’t been installed yet, so I’m trying to find my friend’s room where they offered me to stay for the night, so yes I am a little lost.”

“Oh I can help you then, what’s your friend’s name?”

“Triwt.”

The person in front of me seemingly freezes for almost 2 seconds as they tensed up and slowly relaxed, before asking, “You said Triwt, correct?”

“Yes?”

“Security Commander Triwt?”

“YYYes?”

“You’re her friend?”

“Yeah, I’m also friends with Cerelia and Lys.”

She looks like she is moments from passing out.

“What’s your name by chance, dear?”

“Jordan.”

“The one-”

“The one from the cryopod?”

She nods at me and I let out a sigh.

“Yes. I uh- look it seems I might be in the wrong area-”

“No! No, I just wasn’t expecting someone, well not to be rude, but small and cute like you to be the one who broke my cardio endurance record.”

She looks at me with a smirk and I put two and two together.

“Korextrel?”

“Mhm, I’m surprised a small little guy seriously ran that long. You could at least apologize to me for making an impossible score to beat, at least out of respect to your seniors.”

I nod and look up at their face, “I’m sorry for beating your score, Senior Korextrel.”

She stares at me before laughing, “Goddess, I can’t even be remotely mad at you. You’re like, way too cute to be a security officer. You remind me of my little sister. But the apology is accepted, I would be happy to show you to Triwt’s living quarters.”

*Do I have an effect on people or something?*

*This almost feels like that time I read in an article that elephants think humans look cute.*

*But this is like, maybe the 5th time I’ve heard someone call me ‘too cute’.*

*You probably just are?*

*I appreciate myself trying to lift myself up, but did I seriously have to question my own self esteem like that?*

*It’s a bad habit and you know it.*

*Yeah…*

I look up at Korextrel as I’m following her. It’s not accurate, and probably rude to be comparing, but she reminds me of the depictions of a minotaur, just with much shorter and rounded off horns. That and she has a lot of… curves despite her very toned body.

“I hope you’re paying attention to where we’re going, Commander Triwt assigned me to be your trainer when she isn’t available. You may be cute, but I take my job seriously, and I plan to make you a fine security officer. She informed me you get lost in your thoughts, and while off the clock that’s fine, it’s something we’re gonna be working on when you’re on the clock.”

I nod my head, “Thank you Senior Korextrel for taking care of me.”

“Sheesh, you’re off the clock, don’t be too formal. Anyways, here you are.”

She motions at a door to our right that has photos of Triwt on it with…

“Are those corgis?”

“Hm? No, those are Yoltis. They’re her pets and she loves them dearly.”

“Oh okay, they just look a lot like an animal from where I’m from called corgis.”

“Well the names are kinda similar, I guess.” She says with a shrug, “Anyways, I’m heading up to start my shift, see you around newbie.”

With that, she starts walking away. I wave her goodbye, though I doubt she can see me waving. I turn around to face the door and before I can even knock, the door slides upwards and a large white fluffy snake tail wraps around me and pulls me into the room as the door shuts behind me.

I had instinctively closed my eyes. Turns out I close my eyes when caught off guard.

“Jordan? Meet Luun and Dorin\~!” I feel familiar arms holding me now and I open my eyes to see what are basically 2 giant corgis. 

*Well for a Corgi they’re giant, but I wanna say they’re more around the height of an English Mastiff, which is still huge either way.*

“They have such short and small legs” I say as I looked at them, they were very cute and their coats were well groomed and maintained.

“I know\~! I love watching them run and chase their toys around. They’re such good boys!” Triwt essentially coos at them as she speaks, the two looking up at me and tilting their heads before Triwt sets me down and I’m basically attacked in a fluffy pile of alien dog kisses.

*Thank goodness their saliva isn’t acidic.*

*For the most part.*

*Huh?*

*Well y’know, saliva is really just a chemical the body produces to initiate the deconstruction of food, so to a degree it is acidic.*

*… Could you kill someone with saliva?*

*They’d probably die first from drowning before the acid breaks them down. Now your stomach acid on the other hand.*

*No, I am not continuing this self conversation.*

I laugh a little and let Luun and Dorin give me small licks on my face as I pet them in return. I can hear Triwt giggling in the background before I’m lifted up again, this time with Luun and Dorin, and carried to bed.

The Yoltis seem to have their preferred spots in the bed as I’m being held closely by Triwt. If giant 4 armed fluffy snakes could purr, then Triwt definitely is as she coils around me gently. We haven’t laid down yet, as we’re still sitting up for the most part as I let her do what she wants.

“Jordan?”

“Yes?” I reply as I tilt my head back just enough to look up at her.

“Do you like being held?”

“Like this?” I nod my head. “It’s nice and relaxing, though I doubt this is what working will be like.”

She nods her head, “True, working won’t be like this, especially since I will be your commander, though I will admit this is very nice for me.” She lets out a sigh. “I kinda wish you weren’t getting your own room.” She says with a small laugh.

“Oh? Why’s that?”

“Well, I’m just a little lonely is all. Vast majority of the people on this ship are scared of me, let alone the crazy few who for some reason worship me.”

“Sheesh that must suck, I’m more the type to try and blend in the background, but if you don’t mind me asking, why are people scared of you?”

“Well, it’s rather complicated, but through some terrible events, I’ve landed myself a very scary title that tends to follow me wherever I go.”

“Oh, is it that bad?”

“I’ve once had someone present me a head on a spike as a way to ask me out because they assumed my title meant that I like those things. I do not.”

“Yeah, I don’t think I would want a head on a spike either, so what is that title anyways?”

“On my homeworld I’m known as a War Commander, or a Lady of War. It basically means that I’m considered an elite warrior capable of commanding armies that can turn the tide of battle with just their presence. Men have also received the same title, but would be called Men of War, but the official title is still War Commander.”

“I see. Can you command full armies like the title suggests?”

“Well yes, but that’s besides the point. It brings unwanted attention and it makes it really difficult to make relationships with anyone.”

“Oh, well I think that just makes you a bit more cool, but it doesn’t make me scared of you. You’re Triwt, probably the nicest person to me on this entire ship, with Luun and Dorin tied for 2nd.”

Triwt stares down at me for a few moments before a smile spreads across her face as she stifles a small laugh as she gives me a really big hug.

“And that’s why I like having you around so much, you just aren’t scared of me and you still treat me like an equal, not just some scary lady.”

“Trust me, my mom is a scary lady.” I say with a half laugh as some unpleasant memories flash in my head.

***“You’re too damn quiet, speak the fuck up you little shit!”*** *The back of a hand traveling too fast for my young mind to process.*

***“Wake the fuck up, you miserable little bastard. Why should I be taking care of you?”*** *Coffee, still scalding hot, poured down my arm and chest because I didn’t wake up at 6:00 AM.*

***“It’s your fault he’s gone, you know!”*** *A fist to my stomach followed by relentless kicks once I was curled up on the floor.*

***“I’LL NEVER FORGIVE YOU, YOU FUCKING MISTAKE! YOU WERE NEVER SUPPOSED TO HAVE HIS NAME!”***

*The sensation of blood pouring down my face from multiple open wounds and broken shards of glass is still very fresh, despite how long ago it was…*

I open my eyes with a sudden start, finding my breathing to be erratic and myself in a cold sweat as my mind races and scrambles. Memories are locked up for a reason, and I’d much rather keep those memories forgotten. I can hear myself breathing heavily, though it sounds so distant. The sound of sirens and ringing in the air. It’s all so far away and yet so close as well.

“...-ordan?”

Someone shakes me a little.

“Jordan?”

I look up and see a worried expression on my Dad’s face as it fades away before I can fully see him. I blink and his face is replaced with Triwt’s face. She’s staring at me with a look of genuine worry and slight panic.

“Sorry… I just had some bad memories, that’s all.”

“Bad memories? You mentioned your mother and you suddenly began breathing erratically while clutching at your chest and head. You even started ‘sweating’ despite not working out. You’re rather cold if anything, and you have tears in your eyes.”

“It’s fine, I-I’m fine. It’s been a long time since I’ve had anything like that happen, but you don’t need to worry.”

“Hm, I’m not buying that, but…” She looks me in the eyes. “Call it an instinct of mine, but something tells me you’re just not ready to open that can of ranugas just yet.”

She gently curls around me, her soft fluffy embrace surrounding me. I slowly catch my breath and it feels like I haven’t breathed in forever.

“I’ll let you tell me when you’re ready, but I’ll be here for you when you are.”

“... Thank you…” I whisper out quietly as I gently hold onto her arms, curling up a little as Luun, seemingly sensing my distress and sadness, waddles over and begins licking my face gently, nudging his head against me gently. I reach an arm out and begin gently petting him as I can feel Triwt gently petting my head while humming.

*I really am super emotional, aren’t I?*

*Yeah, but the only ones judging you for that are those that wish they can be open about their emotions like you are.*

*Thanks, me.*

*You’re welcome.*

**Triwt, Female Valis-Trobat Hybrid, Security Commander**

Despite only having fur on the top of his head, it’s rather relaxing to pet Jordan’s head and it seems to be helping him as well after that apparent panic attack.

*This is very nice and quite blissful, but I'm also worried for Jordan.*

i sigh and I close my eyes and find myself slowly drifting to sleep as I protectively curl around Jordan.

*If my mother were to see me, she would say this is as good as being married.*

Too tired to try and fight that thought from my mind, I drift off to sleep. The last thing I noticed before I was fully asleep was that I could hear the faint tapping of mechanical digits on the floor.

_____________________

**\[REDACTED\], Male \[REDACTED\], Agent of The Vanir Empire, Unit 157 Hunt Master**

From my shrewd and very temporary camp just on the edge of town, but close enough to the spaceport, I watch the feed of my little stealth drone as it readjusts it’s position. The tent flaps ruffling in the wind as a snowstorm blows past. Luckily my suit keeps me well protected from the weather, the tent is mainly for protecting my other gear and a place to sleep while remaining undetected. The stealth drone scurries across the floor before finding a spot on a cabinet, high in the kitchen area where it can watch the target rest.

“Hm… Interesting. I thought I recognized that hybrid from somewhere. The War Commander Triwt, ‘The Final Commander’. Heh, if only that little runt wasn’t my target, I would love to have hunted her.”

I watch my target interact with the War Commander, who is seemingly very gentle and relaxed with my target.

“Not the first time I’ve noticed this type of behavior displayed around this, ‘Jordan’... Hm, there was that Kinomaz earlier who guided the target to the War Lady’s living quarters. They’re typically known for being abrasive and blunt, if not rude, yet they seemed to be... happy guiding my target.”

Intrigued, I pull up the video archives and rewatch the scene. I request access to other records of the drone I normally don’t have access to, such as the chemical display and some other stuff that kind of displays emotions.

After about 20 seconds, I receive approved access to the files I desire from my stealth drone.

*Pretty stupid I can’t access these when it’s MY drone…*

I let out a gruff as I looked over the information.

“Hm, seems like I was semi-correct in my theory.”

In the interactions with the Kinomaz, the emotions of the Subject seem to alter and change when interacting with the Target. The Kinomaz initially was displaying annoyance and irritability before being approached by the target. 

*Seems like she was having a bad day.*

But when the Target begins interacting with the Kinomaz, the Kinomaz suddenly starts experiencing… Warmth, nostalgia, and maternal protectiveness?

I can feel my left eye twitch.

“Does it see herself as the target’s mother or something? How is this a superweapon!? It makes people favor it?! Why in the bloody hells is this target the key to our victory?! It doesn't make sense!”

A notification.

*“That’s a side effect of the target’s ‘ability’. Well a side effect of the target’s species to be more accurate. Majority of species found them adorable, cute, or perfect partners, making it easy for them to socialize and intermingle with any groups. Ironically enough they struggle intermingling with themselves over the slightest of differences.”*

*I can almost hear a chuckle from that last part.*

“Okay? What’s the main reason we want the little runt and why are these ‘humans’ so rare apparently?”

*“Since you’re one of the only sane and trustworthy people of your Unit, I have been given permission from Intelligence to tell you.”*

“Okay, so out with it then!”

*“Humans were very popular when arriving on the scene some 300 cycles ago. A species that seemed peaceful and eager to find life besides their own.”*

“Yeah, like every species is when they first become spacefaring, so what?”

*“The weapons! Nearly every weapon these days was inspired by their creativity, that spark in their life to build and create. It just so happens that when humans needed something dead, they would find a way to do it, without fail every time.”*

“If they’re so great, then why is this the first time I’ve heard of one?”

*“Because, they’re either dead or have been hiding from the rest of the galaxy. We only know of ‘The Lost Son of Terra’ as it is stated in the archives that Humans weren’t so peaceful as the galaxy first thought.”*

“Oh?”

*“Humanity began racing towards the stars as they noticed our… allies had been abducting them. They wanted their sons and daughters back. They ripped through many of our allies and did rescue their children, but of course it was impossible to find them all. Our target isn’t* ***THE*** *Lost Son, he is* ***A*** *Lost Son of Terra. A title given to the abducted. Humans only truly showed themselves to the galaxy after their rescue mission became impossible by themselves. So they introduced themselves as a apparently peaceful peaceful species, grieving and desiring their lost children to be returned.”*

“Okay, so a deadly yet peaceful species. I guess it makes sense so far, but why the title?

 *“They say before their space age, Humans would use drink cartons advertising the picture of their children that have gone missing and that they need help finding them. Wherever they are. The title is essentially the drink carton. They want their sons and daughters back, wherever they are.”*

“How does this help us?”

*“Well it has two possibilities. Jordan is stated through your audio records to know how to create ammunition and has made experimental ammunition as well. A brain scan could earn us potentially destructive and useful ammo blueprints. Hells, BYR Rifles and PPMI’s are* ***imitations*** *of guns the Humans designed in their space age and they don’t even come close to what the Humans made!”*

“But, the target has been in cryo for 500 cycles?”

*“Yes, but all humans have a thing for tinkering. He will more than likely improve upon existing designs. Human history is chock full of improving designs. He is already gathering tools for crafting, so we’re almost curious to let him keep working before capturing him.”*

“Ugh, so more time following the target?”

*“Yes, but don’t you want to be like your founders?”*

“Yes, but-”

*“Then be quiet. The second option we have is to head into the Lin’Ottal Sector after capturing the target. It’s rumored that the dead sector is hiding the humans in completely advanced stealth beyond even our Empire’s dreams. They say if you bring a Lost Son or Daughter, the humans will show themselves and accept their lost children home.”*

“So we’re just finding a missing child? For what? Nothing?”

*“No, not just nothing. Everytime a child was found, there was always a reward listed on the 'drink carton'. Technology and even trade agreements.”*

“So either we keep the target and get technology, or we return the target to the ‘rumored to not be dead’ humans and we get super advanced technology and what? Trade agreements that- Oh I see, the trade agreements would make new supply lines from a sector that's 'dead' making it impossible to find out where our supplies are coming from.”

*“Yes, now you’re catching on.”*

“Oh wait, what happened to the humans? We kind of glossed over that.”

*“Well they either killed themselves around 200 cycles ago, or like we said, they more than likely went into hiding.”*

“They killed themselves?”

*“Well, around 200 cycles ago, all life suddenly and alarmingly went missing in the Lin’Ottal Sector. It’s a literal dead space now that used to be home to the Humans.”*

“I see, well, if you excuse me, I have a target to capture alive and healthy, though we’ll see how long this mission will take.”

*“It will take as long as it needs to.”*

The agent disconnects and I return to my monitoring of the target as it rests.

But something in the back of my mind is bugging me, in that one little spot that's invisible to the Empire. That one spot that is truly mine besides my Hunt Master aspirations.

*Who is to say the humans wouldn't see the Vanir Empire for who they are? Who is to say Jordan won't?*

Was just thinking about three places I used to go to all the time - now long gone.

Italian Bite in Civic, Bunda St. Really amazing breakfasts (I put on 10kg here) and very good coffee. I think the main barista was Australian champion if I recall. They used to put a tiny little apple and filo pastry thingy on the saucer with your coffee. Was great!

Hidden Dragon, Bunda St. My love for char siu pork was born here, as was my love for little bowls with soy sauce and fresh chilli to go with said pork. Gained about 10kg here too.

Can’t Remember the Name, Alinga St. sorta near No Name Lane. It was an Asian place that did the world’s best pork laab. He’d only make it once a week and holy crap it would blow your head off some weeks! If anyone knows this guy, please ask him to make a YouTube video or write a book, I have never been able to make a laab as great as his. I think he made other stuff but that laab? Yoh.

Just like last time all of these quotes are a jumble-spagetti-mess of favorite scenes/lines, retorts, and things that can be wildly taken out of context. All of these are in chronological order, so if you want to find them it'll be easier. Hope you enjoy reading! 

Did I miss any of the good quotes? Which was your favorite? 

Names for the quotes are just like book 2: Skull, LUcy, LOckwood, George, Barnes, Flo, Quill, Holly, BobbyVernon. Brackets are descriptions and my comments and no innital is Lucy's narrations/thoughts!

--Book 3--

S: “I say stab them first, ask questions later! That’s your only sensible option.”

S: “Now’s your chance!” it whispered. “Kill them both, and it’s job done!”

Lu [to S]: “And, by the way, we can’t just stab a suspect! I keep telling you this!""

S: “But I’m an invaluable member of the team!” Lu: “Says who? You spend most of the time cheering when we nearly die.”

S: “You’re not going to leave me behind, are you? I’m hoping for a ringside seat when you perish horribly.”

Lu: “How can you possibly think about eating now?” G: “Very easily. Mortal fear gives me an appetite.”

George’s face generally expresses as much emotion as a bowl of custard.

S: ""So you’re setting each other on fire, now? That’s a new one!"" [George threw a flare at a tendril but missed and basically hit Lockwood instead]

S: “Is he [Lo] dead? Yay! Oh. No, he’s hanging on to the shutters. Shame.""

S: ""You three really are incompetence on a stick.”

Unfortunately, the body within the uniform belonged to Quill Kipps, so the overall effect was like watching a plague rat lick a bowl of caviar

S [to Lu]: “You’re wheezing like an asthmatic sloth. It would help to lose a little weight. Like that bit on your hips Lockwood’s always going on about.”

S: “Hark at you, Queen Fibber. I’ve told porkies in my time, but that shocks me something awful. You can’t stand her.”

G: ""It’s bloody murder, pure and simple.”

G: “One day we should do this somewhere nice. You know, have a picnic where nothing’s going to want to kill us. It would be quite fun.”

S: ""If you want to make psychic contact with a killer ghost, why not? I say, Go, girl!”

You could count the times I’d volunteered to help him at the National Newspaper Archives on the fingers of no hands

B [to Lo]: “I like it. Head wounds clearly suit you.”

George had his faraway look, the one that made him look like a constipated owl

Talking to her [F] was like striding naked through a thornbush: not impossible, but there was a definite element of risk

Everything was simple. It was just us, together, chasing a giant helium lion down a central London street.

S: ""Utterly nauseating. Pardon me while I quietly vomit over here""

S: ""You should be vaulting the coffee table and pouring your drink down Munro’s blouse. Look at her, little Miss Prim and Perfect, taking center stage. You’re not standing for this. Go on, punch her! Kick her shins! Snatch off her shoes and throw them in the fire!” Lu: “Will you just—” Everyone looked at me; I cleared my throat. “Will you all just raise a glass,” I said, “to our success? To Lockwood and Co.! To the team!”

I so hoped she’d [H] fall into an open coffin or catacomb or something before the night was out. It didn’t have to be a very bad fall. Just a dusty one. Involving bones.

Lu: ""Is mindless violence your solution to everything?” S: “Pretty much, yeah.”

I contemplated getting into a heated debate with the skull about the moral implications of murder but decided it was pointless.

S [telling Lu how to kill H]: “I’ve got one word for you: egg whisk.”

S: ""Oops"" [after the Lu and H argument at the department store, they feel pressure and they all know they done messed up]

BV: “Ow! Careful. I’m in pain here, you realize.”

What did the guy do or not do to prove that he was a different person and convinced you to give him another shot? 

I flat out asked her if she was done forever and got the response of “well, forever is a long and you never know what might happen, I just need to get my headspace right”.

My ex and I still speak daily, just a good morning and goodnight, sometimes a little more, sometimes a lot more but I just don’t know whether to simply give her no contact and reach out in a few weeks, see how she is and ask her out or even a coffee date. 

The comment was made to me by her a few weeks ago when I made a last ditch effort that she initiated all conversations so now it’s my turn! I’m so confused and any help, negative or positive appreciated. ",1,1730779536.0,relationship_advice,1,0.67,False

I expected a decreased appetite but not a zero appetite…I am currently 283 down 5 since last Wednesday when I took the shot, 10 overall.  It’s been a MAJOR struggle to make sure I’m eating.  I’m eating around 900 each day and that’s if I’m lucky. I’ve been focusing on high protein food, fiber and my water.  Averaging 70g of protein each day and 100oz of water.  I’d like to get more protein but I just can’t eat anymore.  Just ordered some premier protein to mix with my coffee so hopefully that helps bring in some more calories. 

The last thing I want is to lose weight because I’m flat out not eating enough.  I started this medication to help me get over whatever blockage my body has that’s stopped me from losing weight in the past.  I eat moderately healthy, workout 2-3x/week doing cardio and heavy strength training, have been doing this for years but couldn’t lose more than 5-20lbs and it wouldn’t stay off for long. 

I finally asked my dr for help because I was just at my end wanting something to give but this is not the way I want to do it. Back in HS, I struggled with anorexia and I’m worried if this is how this medication goes, my metabolism is just going to end up even more effed…

I’ve read a ton of posts and know I’m not alone with the appetite struggle, but this just can’t be healthy.  I really hope this isn’t how it’s gonna be the entire time…someone tell me it gets better. 🙃",3,1730779308.0,Zepbound,2,1.0,False

I play a ton of retro games on both my PC and my Steam Deck. But for some reason I keep eyeing devices like the Miyoo Mini Plus and I don’t know why. I never had any hand helds as a kid, so I don’t have a personal nostalgia for the form factor. I don’t ever really play games away from home other than on work trips while either on the plane or in my hotel, where the steam deck works wonderfully. Like I can’t see a world where I take a small handheld with me to a coffee shop or a cafe for example. That’s just never been part of my routine. My steam deck and PC stay synced in terms of save states and game saves with SyncThing, an option I don’t think I’ll have on any of these other devices. So keeping my saves synced will be a pain. Like I can really come up with many reasons why I don’t need one, but yet every few months I get this urge to buy one. 

I guess I just wanted to brainstorm with some like minded folks lol. Someone talk me out of buying this darn thing. Or, maybe suggest some use case I’m not thinking of that would convince me to finally pull the trigger. 

And just as an aside, I’m not a millionaire, but I’ve been very fortunate in life and money isn’t the issue here. However, I try and not be wasteful and buy things just for the sake of it. ",1,1730779182.0,retrogaming,1,1.0,False

This is the prompt from ChatGPT: Render a focused, photorealistic image of a young woman sitting at a modern workstation in a dimly lit room. She has an intense, concentrated look as she types on a sleek, mechanical keyboard, surrounded by multiple computer screens displaying complex software processes. She has shoulder-length, dark hair, a casual yet stylish appearance, possibly wearing glasses with a reflective tint from the monitors. The room has a warm, ambient glow, with soft, moody lighting highlighting her focused expression. The desk is organized with a few coffee cups and notebooks, and the room contains shelves of computer hardware and gaming items, showcasing a tech-savvy atmosphere. The lighting is balanced to capture both the details of her features and the subtle reflections off her glasses, creating a sense of depth and focus.

I’m 47 female, technically obese 😢, former smoker but I haven’t smoked in 12 years. Cannabis user, moderate, stopped using vapes over a year ago so I just do edibles. I have ADHD, anxiety, sleep apnea treated with cpap, a high stress life, and my doctor recently diagnosed me with a heart murmur. She said she saw it at my physical last year and assumed it was from my ADHD meds, but since my dad had a major heart attack at age 50 she decided to send me for an echocardiogram- but my appointment isn’t until February. I also drink coffee. I think her deciding factor was that I told her I get short of breath when I lie flat- I use an adjustable bed. 

She didn’t say to stop using the stimulant. Resting heart rate is 82, and I noticed that my heart rate was up to 130 during an argument with my kids - but this was 14 hours after my last stimulant dose. It’s usually around 100 with light activity and when I did a workout today it ranged between 110-130. I felt a little tightness in my chest during the argument and had felt shaky with a fast heart rate after a workout earlier. 

I didn’t take my stimulant today because I was hoping I could get the echo soon - didn’t realize they were booked so far out. I have a very demanding job and I really struggled today. I have several deadlines tomorrow and usually take my stimulant before I leave for the office so it’s kicked in by the time I get to work. I’m on 7.5 adder**l twice a day, but I usually only take the morning dose.

I really think the tightness was just anxiety/ stress, and I’m just way more aware of my heart rate after the physical. I know I can’t get medical advice online and I need to talk to my doctor, but would love some thoughts from people more familiar with cardiology while I wait to hear from her. Just wondering if taking the single dose raises red flags - really hope I don’t have to skip it until February.

1gjy0aq,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1gjy0aq/chatgpt_search_is_public_whats_your_generative/,"ChatGPT Search is Public, What's Your Generative SEO (GEO) Strategy?","You may have seen the Set as Search Engine button atop of ChatGPT's search feature. News publications and noteworthy subject matter experts are calling SearchGPT ""The Google Killer"" and very few are disappointed at the SERP. AI pins, such as Rabbit and Humane, could be powered by OpenAI, along with the unknown of products coming into the marketplace. We're a breath away from having AI Assistant from movies such as H.E.R. with AI's such as JARVIS (Iron Man).

We're all asking ChatGTP ""why did you rank these results in this order,"" and getting back the same ""I don't use an order"" answer. Still, if our clients don't appear in a SERP, there's SEO work to be done.

Thanks to experts like Ryan Jones, who study Google Patents on things like AI Overviews and create tools like SERPrecon, we're able to reverse-engineer AI SERPS to some degree. Still, there are not any published strategies outside of the rhetoric of using schema and writing as if you're answering a question.

# So, Let's Talk About GEO

**My Observations:**

I looked at the SERP for ""I'm looking for breakfast restaurants in La Habra, CA"" in ChatGPT Search and ""breakfast restaurants in La Habra CA"" in Google organic results.

ChatGPT Search gave me Author's Coffee Shop as the 1st result, followed by Eggbred. Google gave me La Habra Heights Cafe, followed by Pepper Shaker Restaurant (the same results Gemini gave me by the way).

Here are the citations ChatGPT gave me (in order):

* **Tripadvisor** \- THE 10 BEST Breakfast Restaurants in La Habra
* Restaurantji - Where to Have Breakfast near La Habra, CA
* **Tripadvisor** \- THE 10 BEST Breakfast Restaurants in La Habra (yes, the same as #1)
* Best Breakfast OC - *Arthur's Coffee Shop* La Habra, CA - Best Breakfast in Orange County
* **OpenTable** \- 6 Best Breakfast Restaurants In Brea / La Habra
* EggBred - EggBred | EggBred
* superpages\_com - Breakfast Restaurants in La Habra, CA
* **Tripadvisor** \- THE 10 BEST Breakfast Restaurants in La Habra

Here are the Google organic results (in order):

* **TripAdvisor** \- THE 10 BEST Breakfast Restaurants in La Habra
* Yelp - THE BEST 10 Breakfast Brunch Spots near LA HABRA, CA
* La Habra Heights Cafe - The Heights Cafe – Great Tasting Breakfast and Lunch
* *Arthur's Coffee Shop* \- Arthur's Coffee Shop La Habra, CA - Best Breakfast in Orange County
* **OpenTable** \- 5 Best Breakfast Restaurants In La Habra
* Denny's - Breakfast near me in La Habra 1150 S Beach Blvd
* Grubhub - 15 Best Breakfast Delivery Restaurants in La Habra
* Yelp - Best Breakfast near Laura's Cafe & Bakery in La Habra, CA
* IHOP - IHOP® Breakfast in La Habra, CA on 1301 W Imperial Hwy

I found it interesting that ChatGPT recognized Arthur's Coffee Shop as ""Best Breakfast OC"", potentially because of the domain it used or keyword-explicit backlinks. Google wasn't fooled by the EMD. I also didn't see any Yelp, probably because their robots.txt denies them access (non-implicitly, but explicitly for Gemini).

User-Agent: Google-Extended  
Disallow: /

User-Agent: \*  
Disallow: /

So I decide to ask a Follow Up Question in ChatGPT Search:

**Question/Prompt: Why is Arthur's Coffee Shop shown first when there are much more notable brands like IHOP and Denny's?**

**Answer:** Arthur's Coffee Shop is highlighted first due to its *strong local reputation* and *popularity* among La Habra residents. As a locally owned establishment, it offers a unique dining experience that reflects the community's character. Many patrons appreciate its cozy atmosphere, friendly service, and classic American breakfast offerings. While national chains like IHOP and Denny's are well-known, *Arthur's Coffee Shop stands out for its personalized touch and local charm*, making it a favorite for those seeking an authentic, community-focused breakfast spot.

Continuing my quest to understand, I continued.

**Question/Prompt: You made some interesting statements in your answer. How do you know the local reputation and popularity are represented by La Habra residents?**

**Answer:** Arthur's Coffee Shop has garnered positive feedback from both locals and visitors, as evidenced by numerous reviews. For instance, a reviewer on Tripadvisor mentioned, ""We are a group of six ladies who have been coming to Arthur's for many years. We love it so much—the delicious food, the friendly workers, and great atmosphere."" Additionally, the restaurant holds a 4.5-star rating on Google, based on 468 reviews, further indicating its favorable standing among patrons. These testimonials suggest that Arthur's Coffee Shop is well-regarded in the La Habra community.

**Inferences:**

1. While GenAI only displays actual businesses, they appear to use their SERPS to determine who to display.
2. Citations may play an important role in GEO like they used to for Google Maps.
3. For location-based queries, ChatGPT Search seems to have a bias on trusting TripAdvisor.
4. On that same note, I'm not seeing a lot of Yelp citations in subsequent searches.
5. Tech SEO and user experience may matter less (if at all) to GenAI, which is great news for SMBs.
6. Links may matter less to GenAI, or else IHOP and Denny's would be first.
7. GenAI pays attention to reputation beyond the stars, taking actual context to determine local relevance.

# Key Takeaways

I haven't even touched the surface of the research ahead of me. Still, I'm finding it extremely fascinating how much weight ChatGPT Search gives to citations, reputation, and even context within business websites that allow them to crawl.

So where do we start our tests?

* Barnacle SEO? Start with the top-cited directories in our citation optimization?
* Parasite SEO? Start with the top-cited non-directories in our contributed content efforts?
* Buying a bunch of exact match domains and attempting to replicate Authur's Coffee Shop?
* Start looking for ""Content-Blasting Services"" in Fiverr (formerly $5 link-building services)?

Obviously, I'm kidding, please don't compromise your brand by giving your best content to websites other than your own. But where you might start is by doing the following:

1. Study the SERP and create an action plan based on your findings (for testing).
2. Follow tags and Google Alerts for ""Generative AI"" ""SEO,"" ""GenAI SEO,"" and ""GEO"" ""SEO"".
3. Write posts like these in hopes that someone might be willing to share their test results.

Also, bonus points to whoever can guess the 5 consecutive words above that Nash added to Emery's magic word list while inside her. 😜

Anyhoo, the vast majority of FMC’s magic words go undefined in this book, just listed like a mantra. Mentioned in passing during her lil panicky moments.

So on my re-read last week, I looked them up.

All of them.

The digital landscape is changing rapidly, and one of the most significant shifts in recent years is the rise of voice search. With the increasing popularity of voice-activated devices such as smartphones, smart speakers, and virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant, voice search is quickly becoming a dominant way people interact with search engines. According to recent statistics, a substantial portion of all online searches are now made through voice commands, and this trend is expected to continue growing. As a result, optimizing your website for voice search is no longer optional—it's essential for businesses looking to stay competitive in the digital age.



In this blog, we will explore the importance of voice search optimization, explain how it differs from traditional text-based search, and provide actionable strategies that will help businesses and website owners prepare for the future of search.



\### Why Voice Search Optimization Matters



Voice search has fundamentally changed the way users engage with search engines. With voice-activated devices, users can now ask questions, search for information, or perform tasks hands-free, all with the power of their voice. This is a game-changer for both consumers and businesses alike, but it also introduces a unique set of challenges for those in digital marketing and search engine optimization (SEO).



Here are a few reasons why voice search optimization is crucial:



1. \*\*Changing User Behavior\*\*  

   Traditional search queries often involve typing short keywords or phrases into a search engine. In contrast, voice searches tend to be longer, more conversational, and more specific. For instance, instead of typing “weather NYC,” a voice search might sound like “What’s the weather like in New York City today?” This shift in how people search requires businesses to adapt their SEO strategies to match the natural language and intent of voice queries.



2. \*\*Mobile and On-the-Go Usage\*\*  

   Voice search is primarily used on mobile devices, smart speakers, and wearables, making it ideal for users who are on the move. Whether they are asking for directions, making a purchase, or seeking out a local service, voice search offers convenience and speed. Optimizing for voice search helps businesses connect with users in real-time, especially when they are seeking immediate answers or looking to engage with a nearby service provider.



3. \*\*Local Search\*\*  

   Voice search is particularly useful for local searches. When users perform voice queries, they often expect location-specific answers. For example, a user might ask, “Where’s the nearest coffee shop?” or “Find a plumber near me.” Businesses that serve local communities can greatly benefit from voice search optimization, as this provides a golden opportunity to be discovered by users who are looking for nearby services.



4. \*\*Hands-Free Convenience\*\*  

   Voice search makes it easy for users to search for information without needing to interact with a screen or keyboard. Whether cooking in the kitchen, driving, or exercising, people are more likely to use voice search in these hands-free situations. Optimizing your website for voice search means you’re catering to the growing demand for convenience and accessibility in user experiences.



\### Voice Search vs. Traditional Search: Key Differences



To understand how to optimize for voice search, it's essential to recognize how it differs from traditional search methods. Here are the key distinctions:



1. \*\*Query Length\*\*  

   Text-based searches tend to be brief and direct, usually consisting of just a few keywords. In contrast, voice search queries are longer and more conversational. For example, while someone might type “best pizza near me,” they may say, “What’s the best pizza place near me with good reviews?”



2. \*\*Natural Language\*\*  

   People use natural, full-sentence questions when performing voice searches, which is closer to how they speak rather than how they type. This means that optimizing for voice search requires targeting long-tail keywords and questions that reflect how real people converse.



3. \*\*User Intent\*\*  

   Voice search queries often have a clear intent, such as finding local businesses, getting directions, or making a purchase. This means that voice search optimization should focus on providing answers that align with specific user needs, whether it’s an instant answer, a recommendation, or a location-based result.



4. \*\*Search Results\*\*  

   While traditional search results may display multiple pages of content, voice search usually delivers a single, direct answer. This makes it critical for websites to focus on structured data, such as local listings and featured snippets, to increase their chances of being the “chosen answer” for a voice search query.



\### Key Strategies for Optimizing Your Website for Voice Search



Now that we’ve established why voice search optimization is so important and how it differs from traditional search, let’s discuss some effective strategies you can implement to optimize your website for voice search.



\#### 1. \*\*Focus on Conversational Keywords and Phrases\*\*



As we mentioned earlier, voice search queries are often longer and more conversational than typed queries. Therefore, it's essential to target long-tail keywords and phrases that reflect how users speak. Think about the questions your audience might ask aloud, and try to incorporate these into your content.



For example:

\- Instead of just targeting ""best sushi in Chicago,"" consider optimizing for ""What’s the best sushi restaurant in Chicago?""

\- Instead of “affordable hotels,” optimize for “What are some affordable hotels near me?”



To find these conversational phrases, you can use tools like Google’s Keyword Planner or Answer the Public, which can help uncover questions that people frequently ask.



\#### 2. \*\*Optimize for Local Search and “Near Me” Queries\*\*



Many voice searches are location-based. People often use voice commands to find nearby businesses, services, and points of interest. To ensure your website is visible for local searches, it's essential to:

\- Claim and optimize your Google My Business listing.

\- Include location-based keywords in your content.

\- Ensure that your Name, Address, and Phone Number (NAP) details are consistent across all online platforms.



By focusing on local SEO, you can help your business rank higher for “near me” searches and increase the chances of being found by potential customers in your area.



\#### 3. \*\*Improve Site Speed and Mobile-Friendliness\*\*



Voice searches are often conducted on mobile devices, so it’s essential to ensure your website is mobile-friendly and loads quickly. A slow-loading site can hurt your rankings in both voice and traditional search results. Use tools like Google’s PageSpeed Insights to test and improve your site speed, and ensure your site is responsive across all devices.



\#### 4. \*\*Implement Structured Data (Schema Markup)\*\*



Structured data, also known as schema markup, helps search engines understand the content on your page more effectively. By adding schema markup to your website, you increase your chances of appearing in featured snippets, which are often the answers read aloud by voice assistants. Whether it’s for a product, review, recipe, or business listing, structured data helps search engines provide more accurate and detailed results for voice searches.



\#### 5. \*\*Create FAQs and Content That Answers Questions Directly\*\*



One of the most effective ways to optimize for voice search is to create content that directly answers common questions. Voice searchers are typically looking for immediate answers, so having a dedicated FAQ section or blog posts that address common queries related to your business can increase your visibility in voice search results.



For instance, a restaurant could have a page with answers to questions like:

\- “What are your hours of operation?”

\- “Do you offer vegetarian options?”

\- “What’s your address?”



By answering these types of questions clearly and concisely, you improve your chances of being the “answer” provided by voice search systems.



\### Conclusion



Voice search optimization is more than just a passing trend—it's a critical component of any forward-thinking SEO strategy. As voice-activated devices continue to grow in popularity, businesses that fail to optimize for voice search risk losing visibility and traffic to competitors who are better prepared. 



By understanding the differences between voice search and traditional search and implementing strategies like conversational keyword targeting, local SEO optimization, mobile-friendly websites, and structured data, you can position your website for success in the evolving digital landscape.

It's usually only one or often *none* per update, so when I saw this sudden windfall, I had to try ALL of them. 

**Hearse of Pancakes**

Notes: *There’s still a little time to kill before the viewing… surely it wouldn’t hurt to stop for a short stack? Black coffee, syrup-drenched buckwheat cakes, and a crusty cruller for the road.*

As one might expect, this is very sweet. I didn’t expect to like this because it sounded like it would have tons of maple syrup and anything with maple syrup is too sweet for me. However, there’s less syrup and more coffee in this than I anticipated, which helps to cut the sweetness a bit. 

I can smell bitter-sweet coffee, fluffy pancakes, butter, maple syrup, and cinnamon. Very realistic, truly smells like I could actually stick a fork in them. I would not wear this as a perfume because it’s just too sweet for that, but as a room spray I think it’s delicious. 

General Impression: Very sweet, rich, gourmand. 

FS or no? Yes, but probably just one. If I were more into super sweet gourmands though, this would be a panic and buy ALL the bottles type situation. 



**Lime Green Hearse**

Notes: *A shiny, genteel, vintage ride for all those who feel dead inside: lime rind, citron, petitgrain, white musk, a swish of bay rum and a bit of black pepper.*

Going by the notes, I thought perhaps this would be a masculine cologne type scent. It’s not like that at all though. The notes that really pop out here are the lime and the citron. They’re both fresh, but unexpectedly sweet notes. I cannot smell the white musk as a separate note, but it seems to be giving the lime a fizzy quality. In the background, I can also smell the rum and the barest hint of black pepper. 

General Impression: Slightly sweet, fresh, bright, tart, citrusy. 

FS or no? I will not be buying a bottle of this. It’s not bad, I just don’t love lime enough to want my house to smell like this. 



**Hot Pink Hearse**

Notes: *A dream hearse for anyone who grew up presiding over numerous doll funerals: flashy pink guava, strawberry jam, sugared pink grapefruit, blackberry, bergamot, and pink champagne adorned with a gleaming chrome Landau bar.*

I definitely did not need to look at the notes to know this contained guava and champagne. Aside from those two notes, I can also smell strawberry, pink grapefruit, and blackberry. All of these notes seem “sugared” to me, but they don’t come off as super sweet lollipop type notes. It’s more like fresh fruit topped with sugar. The pink grapefruit and blackberry both have a pleasant tartness that helps to temper the sugar. It’s got a nice balance to it. I am happy that I’m not smelling any “chrome” as I absolutely hate metallic notes. This is such a fun scent!

General Impression: Sweet, sugary, fruity, fizzy, tart, girly, playful. 

FS or no? Yes, but probably just one because fruity isn’t what I usually go for in room ambiance scents. 



**Hiss and Hearse**

Notes: *A dribble of Dorian and a squiggle of Snake Oil, delicately stirred with a moss-crusted muddy shovel.*

This is a bit disappointing. All I can really smell is the Snake Oil. No Dorian, no mud, *maybe* a hint of moss. I love Dorian by itself, but Snake Oil not so much. Still though, I have to say I think Snake Oil works a lot better as a room spray than it does as a perfume (personal opinion obviously). 

General Impression: Slightly sweet, resinous, powdery. 

FS or no? No, I’m not willing to pay $45 for this. If it were $33 like the other sprays, there’s a chance I’d consider it just to see if Dorian appears during aging. However, if you LOVE Snake Oil and want a room spray to match your favorite perfume, look no further. 



**Convertible Hearse**

Notes: *The cadaver, my friend, is blowin’ in the wind: a chilly whoosh of dead leaves seasoned with the perfect amount of smog.*

Eye watering bonfire smoke. That’s all. 

General Impression: Smokey and slightly sweet. 

FS or no? Hellll no. I hate this. For a point of reference, I’m someone who really enjoys scents like BPAL’s Smokestack, but Convertible Hearse ain’t it. 



**Headless Hearseman**

Notes: *A bottomless swirl of black leather, dead branches, and flaming pumpkin guts.*

I expected to hate this, but it’s actually my favorite of the sprays by a wide margin. I smell the lab’s dead leaves note very strongly (even though it’s not listed in the notes). I’m super confused because I hate leather. I actually hate it so much that leather notes often make me feel a bit queasy. But in this, the leather doesn’t smell like leather to me at all. It smells like a deep, rich and somewhat sweet tobacco. I guess if I concentrate, I can imagine some part of this note as leather…. but I have to really search my soul to find it. I can also smell a smoky, sweet, vegetal pumpkin with a dash of cinnamon. 

General Impression: Slightly sweet, deep, rich, atmospheric. 

FS or no? Yes, several in fact. 



Bonus Review: **Pumpkin Nut Bread**

Notes: *Pumpkin puree baked into a walnut-studded loaf, steaming with cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove.*

Ahhh, this is sad. Really glad I didn’t opt for a bottle straight away. There’s something *off* about it. I can smell overly sweet pumpkin bread, walnuts, and a vague hint of spice. Something about it makes me wrinkle my nose. It smells… fake? I guess. I dunno. I was really looking forward to this one, but I just don’t like it. 

General Impression: Very sweet, creamy, gourmand. 

FS or no? Definitely a no from me.

He has expressed to me he is uncomfortable with some of my male friends and coworkers. He says it’s his boundary that his partner can’t have these close friendships that make him uncomfortable. It is mainly around one group chat where we discuss fantasy football and one friend who I’ve been close with for 10 years. He and I will occasionally text 1-1 and grab coffee sometimes. 

He is upset I haven’t handled the situation by telling my male coworkers and friends to not text me 1-1. I feel this is controlling. He says it’s a boundary and I’m not respecting him by not “handling” it. He said if I had an issue with any of his friends he’d handle it immediately. 

I am empathetic that he may be feeling jealous or I guess just views it as wrong for men and women to be close friends. But I feel it’s weird to text a friend who in my opinion has done nothing wrong and tell them they need to speak to me less and not in 1-1 texts. Also I don’t want to leave this fantasy football league? 

I told him I wouldn’t stop texting my friends and that he was being controlling in requesting I demand my friends only speak to me in groups. He got angry and said I was acting like I lived for male attention.

**The Power of PPC Marketing Automation**

**In the ever-evolving landscape of digital marketing, where milliseconds matter and competition is fierce, automation has emerged as a game-changer. Pay-Per-Click (PPC) advertising, with its real-time bidding and dynamic ad placements, demands agility and precision. That’s where automation steps in, wielding its magic wand to optimize, streamline, and elevate your PPC efforts.**

* **Efficiency Unleashed:**
* Manual tasks can be time-consuming and error-prone. Automation liberates marketers from mundane chores like bid adjustments, keyword research, and ad scheduling. With algorithms crunching data faster than a caffeinated squirrel, you can focus on strategy and creativity.
* Imagine bidding wars fought by AI bots while you sip your chai. That’s the efficiency automation brings.
* **Precision Targeting:**
* Automation tools analyze user behavior, demographics, and intent signals. They serve your ads to the right audience at the right moment. No more showing cat food ads to dog lovers!
* Dynamic search ads adapt to search queries dynamically. It’s like having a chameleon ad that blends seamlessly into any search result.
* **Budget Optimization:**
* Ever felt the panic of overspending on irrelevant clicks? Automation allocates your budget intelligently, maximizing ROI. It’s like having a financial advisor for your ad spend.
* Set your budget, sip your chai (again), and watch the magic unfold.

-An LED picture lamp installed above the art

An area rug for the couch would be sick. I’m indecisive on color/patterns there


I’m not too happy with the lighting, especially with how dull the grey floors appear at nighttime. Considering some back lighting on the ladder shelf, or maybe some small battery lamp/light. 

I want to set a mood, but I haven’t figured it out yet. I’m a fan of the art hanging beside the L couch, between the themes of nature and cool coordinated colors. 

Lastly, my bathroom’s ultra plain, and I’m not a fan of the tile or the sink (not allowed to renovate/change tiling) felt pretty uninspired here. 

Any advice on placing lamps or lighting to improve the feel in here? Any color palates I could explore in the communal areas or my bathroom?

> On Monday, disbarred attorney, unpaid ex-Donald Trump staffer, and disgraced politico Rudy Giuliani floated the idea that he could resume his position as Gotham&#039;s mayor-23 years after he left the office.

> It&#039;s hard to imagine how Giuliani even has time to consider the costly and stressful endeavor of running for office-especially in a city that has openly denounced him for driving Trump&#039;s election conspiracies.

> Giuliani&#039;s decision to serve at Trump&#039;s side has lost him practically every merit in the years since.

> The former Trump attorney unsuccessfully filed for bankruptcy, lost his accountant over his insurmountable debts, begged Trump for help settling his seven-figure legal fees, had his WABC radio show canceled for spewing 2020 election lies, and miserably started his own coffee brand, &quot;Rudy Coffee,&quot; in an effort to funnel in some extra cash.

> Giuliani claimed he was stiffed by his favorite client, Trump, to the tune of millions of dollars.

> Amazingly, Giuliani&#039;s legal troubles don&#039;t end there: The MAGA henchman is also one of 19 co-defendants in the Georgia election interference case and was named in April in an Arizona indictment charging another slew of Republican officials and Trump allies for their alleged involvement in a scheme to overturn the state&#039;s 2020 presidential election results.

This is a short trip for us as we normally spend 7-10 days here 3 or 4 times a year. I wanted to provide some insight to outsiders of the status here.

Water: Still under a boil advisory. We brought 12 gallons of bottle water with us not sure of the availability. But every grocery store, gas station, and restaurant has a good supply of bottle water. Ice is not as easy to find. We are treating the tap water like the tap water in Mexico. Bathing and washing dishes is fine, but we use bottled for brushing teeth. I've accidentally drank a little bit of water in the shower at least a dozen times, haven't seen any adverse reactions.

Restaurants: We ate out 6 times. Many restaurants, coffee shops, and bars are still closed. Not all places are investing in the infrastructure to use bottled water in the kitchen. We noticed that some places are full of people others seem almost empty. Food has been a bit subpar and service has been slow, not complaining, just how things are. Apparently many employees left town and places are short on labor. So be patient. The staff we spoke to seemed happy they were open and that we the tourist were there. We left higher tips than normal, 30%-50%. 

Activities: Most of the normal activities are still closed: hiking, Biltmore, window shopping. And fall leafs are near the end of their peek. There will be some color still on the trees next weekend. The arts district and some area along the river have been completely destroyed. 

Traffic and Parking: Traffic is a little worse than normal. Most roads in the city are open and cleared, we didn't have any problem getting around. Parking downtown is easy given no tourist. Travel to the smaller towns, parks, and other attractions in the mountains is definitely limited, so do some research there. 

Friday and saturday were perfect days here, sunny, warm, the leafs are just past their peek. Just beautiful days. This should be peak tourism time. And yet, downtown was almost empty. The number of people was about the same as a cold weekend in January. It was really sad. 

Summary: The city is still hurting and some resources are limited. The normal amount of tourists can't be supported right now. But a small number of tourists can and should come.

1gjx3gj,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1gjx3gj/is_this_workplace_bullying_or_am_i_the_problem_my/,"Is this workplace bullying, or am I the problem? My skip-level told me this is something I'll have to deal with in any job, but I've had a lot of jobs and it's never been this bad before.","I lost a lot of confidence in June 2023, when I was laid off (for the first time in my life) from a startup. Five months later, the only job I could land was a temp position at a major company I've always loved and respected. I took the position, hopeful that I could move up the ladder after proving myself.

My direct team praised me early on so much that our group's VP set up a 1:1 with me because she was so impressed. I earned a surprise pay raise out of nowhere after four months.

Meanwhile, despite all this, there were some red flags, particularly with the corporate social team, who I was expected to work with on projects for my department. My manager and I attend a weekly meeting with them, and it's been stressful from the start.

The meetings consist of the head of social (a slightly older man), a project manager (a woman around my age), an editorial representative from my department (a slightly older woman), my manager (a man who is just a few years older than me), and me. Early on, my skip-level and manager encouraged me to build a relationship with the project manager - we will call her Kate. But there was never any real chance for a friendship to blossom between us. I had been hired to take over a project she'd been pulled from, without a reason why. She told me this when we grabbed coffee one day during our lunch break. She also told me that, just a few months before I joined the company, she and her previous manager were told that their jobs were being eliminated, but that they could interview for some new roles that were opening up soon. She said her manager was so furious, she refused to re-apply, and started her own company. Kate said she ""had no choice"" but to re-apply and re-interview to work for the company.

Her old role consisted of social media support for my product department. Basically, she used to be the ""old me."" Her salary was paid out of my department's budget. I think there might be some lingering resentment towards my department for her firing.

She told me, ""Enjoy it while it lasts."" I wasn't sure what to make of that.

After that day, I knew we wouldn't be friends, but I hoped that we could work together without issue. But when my skip-level suggested an idea for social that was inspired by a picture I took, I tried my hardest to execute it. I brought it up repeatedly in meetings, but Kate, the editorial representative, and the head of social all blinked at me as if I was speaking a different language. My manager has proven to be a bit timid when it comes to defending or advocating for me, although he does try sometimes.

Kate would ignore my Teams messages for days or weeks at a time. One time, I needed a timely response, so I sent her a Teams message and after twenty minutes, I emailed her the same question with my manager and skip-level copied. She replied to the email quickly, and then replied to my Teams chat, ""Did you just ask me this same question in an email?"" I apologized and tried to smooth it over with a Happy Friday gif. But that experience taught me that if I wanted a response, I needed to email her and copy the head of social along with my manager.

She always made excuses for projects she didn't want to work on together - projects that my skip-level said would ""be a great opportunity to partner."" Her excuses ranged from the project being something she was no longer responsible for since taking on her new role, to ""that is something the head of social should work on."" (Her title used to be Social Media Manager, by the way.)

Kate would tell me, ""I need advance notice for an idea"" and I would reply, ""I'm giving you two months' notice."" I would suggest that we film on a Tuesday for a specific event, and she would say, ""The team that films only comes in on Wednesdays."" But when the head of social would bring these ideas up in our meeting, and I would bring to light the scheduling issue, Kate would say, ""Oh, we can accommodate your needs"" as if she hadn't been telling me just the opposite privately for weeks.

Even the head of social scoffs at my ideas. One day, we had to meet privately because Kate, my manager, and the editorial rep were all out of the office. It seemed like a positive meeting. The head of social seemed thrilled by my idea. But later, when we all met as a group again, he made a negative comment about the ""silly"" idea I'd pitched, and stifled his own laughter, and Kate began grinning. After ten minutes, she said, ""I'm just laughing at my roommate's dog off-camera.""

My idea never came to fruition. It was never spoken of again. I followed up on it via email, and then dropped it when I was ignored.

Let me pause here and ask - if you are in a group meeting, and someone says, ""Sorry if it looks like I'm making faces, that's just because of x, y, and z happening off-camera"" or ""I'm laughing because of my dog off-camera"" is it paranoid to assume that they're lying and that they are actually making faces at or laughing at you? Because both the editorial rep and Kate have done this before, and I always feel like it happens right after a moment when I spoke or someone spoke to me or about me.

Our department's SVP has been holding regular emergency meetings to strategize ideas to save the failing business. There has been an emphasis placed on social media. My skip-level privately asked me during our 1:1 how much involvement I've had with social, saying it's been brought to her attention that I haven't been as involved as she assumed. I explained to her how my ideas are ignored and mocked, and how it feels like an uphill battle getting anything done. She said something like, ""Well, you will have to deal with people like this at any job you have."" But I've had a lot of jobs and it's never been this bad before. Have I dealt with rude colleagues? Yes. But never this consistently, and at the end of the day, my colleagues always got the work done. But not Kate. It's almost like she is actively trying to stop my department from succeeding.

Today I woke up with a new idea - let's interview people in our city near our headquarters and make a fun Reel out of it. We could ask them trivia questions related to a new product we are launching. I ran the idea past two senior colleagues, and they loved it. I ran the idea past my skip-level and manager, and they loved it. My manager agreed to pitch it to the social team (at my request), since they usually listen to him over me. Our meeting started, and my manager pitched the idea, and everything seemed to be going well. But then Kate started talking negatively about the idea, saying, ""Lots of companies do this near our office, and I always tell them no or ignore them, because I think it's stupid and annoying.""

The head of social laughed awkwardly and said, ""It sounds like a tourist activity then! Stick to just tourists."" Then he suggested that we interview employees in our office instead. Kate said, ""Legal prefers for us to \*not\* interview employees. It would be more organic if they \*weren't\* employees.""

The head of social suggested we film at an event, and Kate said, ""The sound sucks in conference halls. We just experienced this at Comic-Con."" She complained for what felt like fifteen minutes. Then she said, ""I mean, I can put this on the calendar for our video team. But we'll need a member from the department with experience.""

My manager said, ""Balletbouquet has experience filming. She can go, right?""

I said, ""Yes, I can go.""

Kate repeated in the most scathing tone I'd ever heard her use, ""We need a member from the department with experience. Our video guy is only going to set up the shot and microphone. We need a member from the department with experience who is comfortable doing this.""

Now, I am absolutely experienced. I have been working in marketing for years, and I am 100% comfortable doing this. Frankly, I'm way overqualified for this temp position, which only fuels my current career insecurity. I've appeared on camera for video marketing efforts and TikTok content for a major agency, provided voiceover work for a startup, and filmed from behind the camera for numerous companies. I even majored in journalism in college. I have interviewed strangers for numerous projects, both during college and my professional career. But when Kate questioned my competence in front of the entire group, I froze in shock. I just sat there on camera and said nothing. Partly it's because of my upbringing -  I was raised to be polite, to please people, to never confront. 

My manager eventually said, ""We'll find someone"" and Kate said, ""Okay, I'll put it on the calendar"" and that was that.

But I left that meeting in shock, and when I told my senior colleague what happened, she said, ""What the heck! You'd be perfect at interviewing people! What is her problem!""

Later, my dad called me out of the blue to check in, and as I was explaining the situation to him, I began to cry. I just couldn't help it. It hit me all at once after verbalizing everything.

I feel I'm vetting my dates well enough before meeting but I'm getting disempathic and co-dependent people based on face to face interactions. This shouldn't surprise me based on how society has pushed toward anti-social ways of communicating but I am surprised it's coming out of this age bracket. 40+ should be lower edge of Gen-X. We grew up face to face and with telephone calls, not text.

I had 2 dates with the 51 year old and surprisingly after the 2nd date I got a ""just friends"" bomb via text after talking voice via the app and phone setting up the 2nd date. I wasn't going to ask for a 3rd date but I was going to talk to her over the phone. I found her text dump and run disrespectful, and immature for our age.

I'm educated, successful, have my life ducks in a row, dress sharp, tall (6'1""+), fit like a runner, moderately attractive, speak well and can carry a conversation. What I don't do is play games, but that's what I'm getting in return. I'm not good at pokey banter, either. Personally, I think sarcasm and pick-on-you banter is immature. 

I have 2 dates lined up, Wednesday and Monday.
My date formats have been dinner, lunch, comedy show and trivia night. These next 2 dates are coffee and dessert at diners. I like face to face conversation. I don't drink, so I gotta do something other than that.

I'm getting close to just stopping dating for a while out of frustration. Any tips?",0,1730775396.0,datingoverforty,61,0.45,False
1gjwwwb,https://www.reddit.com/r/bupropion/comments/1gjwwwb/1_month_and_a_half_in_my_experience_so_far/,"1 month and a half in, my experience so far.","I'll start by saying that if you are on the fence about trying Bupropion, I would highly recommend giving it a shot. I'm a 31 year old female and this is the first antidepressant I have tried. I wish I would have tried it a decade ago.    

For the first 2 days or so (150 mg xl in the morning) I experienced some severe digestive side effects. Gas,diarrhea, cramping. I almost wanted to stop taking it, but I'm glad I pushed through because by the third day all of these side effects completely subsided.  

I stopped drinking caffeine entirely for the first 5 days of being on Bupropion. Before this I would consume a 20 oz cold brew and at least one Red Bull most days. I definitely felt groggy and irritable w out caffeine so on the fifth day I decided to try having a small amount of coffee (half a cup) and immediately started feeling better. My caffeine consumption is still WAY lower (12-16 ozs of coffee a day) 1.5 months in to being on Bupropion and I do attribute my lack of energy to my depression. Now instead of relying on an insane amount of caffeine to just get by I am able to make it through the day with level energy.

I will say the only time this medication made me feel tired was when I increased my dose from 150 mg to 300 mg. This lasted for about 2 days. I felt generally kind of numb and exhausted. It really freaked me out because I thought maybe I was finally becoming accustomed to the medication and the honeymoon phase was over and this was the actual effect. After a couple days my body adjusted and I've been on this dose since and am feeling really good. 

My whole life I assumed an anti depressant would kind of numb me out or take away some of my emotional intensity...which I have found to be totally untrue on Bupropion. If anything, now I feel far more equipped to handle and process my emotions. Before it all felt really heavy and impossible. Now, I still feel a wide variety of emotions, they are just easier to navigate. 

Another thing that kept me from going on an antidepressant was weight gain (shallow I know) but it's something I've struggled w my whole life and I knew long term I could not stay on a medication that made my weight even more difficult to stabilize. 1.5 months in on Bupropion I've lost 7 lbs (albeit I am actively trying to lose weight right now). Point is I haven't gained weight which is HUGE. 

Alcohol use disorder and alcoholism/addiction in general run in my family and I have struggled w alcohol on and off for around 12 years. This medication has entirely diminished my desire to binge drink. Before I felt a real compulsion to KEEP drinking to excess. Now if I have a beer with dinner or something I can leave it at that. (I am trying to stop altogether because I know you really shouldn't drink on this medication) ((baby steps)) 

Anyways, I thought I'd make this post because when I first started this medication I came to Reddit to see how other peoples experiences were and I found it really helpful. ",2,1730775387.0,bupropion,1,1.0,False

1gjwwor,https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveTV/comments/1gjwwor/i_channeled_my_inner_mickey_tonight/,I channeled my inner Mickey tonight.+,"LOL, well, sort of, anyway. I had bought some things at a grocery store tonight, including a box of Mallomars. I had seen the Mallomars on a display at the last minute, so it was an impulse buy.

Right after I bought them I realized that I should have checked the date--I am slow with eating & finishing boxes of cookies, and I also don't always open them right away. The one that I had bought had a January 13 date on them (which obviously is not bad) but when I went back to the display to take a second look, I saw some with a January 26 date.

I had my receipt so I went back over looking for the cashier that I had just had two minutes before, but she had left her area and was doing something else in the aisles. I saw another cashier and showed her the two boxes and my receipt and said, ""I just want to change to this one because it's a better date."" She said, ""Oh, you have to see the manager for that.""

Me: (feeling tired) ""Who is that?"" (I looked around and saw the cashier that had just had, so I gestured towards her, although she wasn't looking over at us.) ""She was the one who checked me out..""

Cashier is still looking around for the manager. I'm tired and I just want to get out of there.

Me: ""I'm just taking this.""  I put the new box into my tote bag, and I leave the old Mallomars box on the register, and start to leave.

I just wasn't in the mood to stay in the store anymore. It was really just trading one box of cookies for another with a slightly better date. I totally thought of that **LOVE** coffee scene though, when the guy didn't want to let Mickey take the cup of coffee even though she's a regular there, because she didn't have her wallet (end of Season 1/Episode 1) and she says, ""No, I'm fucking taking this coffee right now.""

Also, if so—why? I’m a half black American and half Pakistani. My African ancestors have been in the US since 1705 coming into Virginia on a slave boat. (My father’s ancestry is traced back directly was back to Mohammed).

For 4 centuries, half my people were traded and bred like animals. And I’m one of the first people in my black side born AFTER civil rights.

If my people were barely seen as human beings, why are priests trying to tell me my divorce is a sin and it’s the worst thing ever. I come from a people being baptized into the name of Christ for slave labor and being divided into pieces like his garments. 

Question 2: Isn’t being divorced actually a step up since it acknowledges I actually had legal rights that my ancestors didn’t have before? Not to mention—I was an interracial marriage and even that wasn’t legal until 1967.

Question 3: How does Orthodoxy look at a people group like black slaves in the Americas both inside and outside of Orthodoxy? Not many blacks convert to Orthodoxy. And we won’t even touch the Pakistani side (Satan’s probably pissed one of us females got away from Shiite Islam and lived to tell! But to be fair—Christ is his mercy probably allows us to be martyred instead of giving us time to find Orthodoxy because many of us can’t fit in well after leaving that nonsense). 

Thanks for the insight and forgive any unintended offenses. I just don’t understand what I’m supposed to do being different and trying to respectfully wait for people to catch up. Teaching seems like the obvious answer but I don’t consider myself compassionate enough to know what to do if things go south during coffee hour.

I’ve had eczema my whole life. In 2021 my skin started acting up, fast forward to 2023 I was in a full body, debilitating flare. I discovered the horrible world of TSW and was convinced it was that - I went on immunosuppressive drugs and got my life back, but now I’m realizing there likely is/was a mild element this whole time. 

Recently had a mycotoxin test and tested very positively (or bad?). Ochratoxin was the worst, reading was 10x normal range, followed by Alflotoxin and Gliotoxin.

My ND has started me on a mold protocol…nyastatin, glutathione, charcoal, methylfolate to name a few. I’m doing Epsom hot baths, saunas, low mold diet. Ps, Bulletproof coffee has no flavour!

Shortly after starting the protocol I went from 0-100 in the way of anxiety, panic, depression, feeling flat/hopeless, weeping…I’m also 45W so hormonal changes are possible too. Anyone relate?

I bought some test kits on Amazon…was planning on testing areas of home and my work. Are these kits a good clue?

I don’t know if this will actually help me in any way, but I just need to get this off my chest. I guess Reddit will do. So... here’s my story.

A while back, during my summer in Croatia, I was on the hunt for a part-time job. You know, just something to earn a little cash without too much commitment. That’s when my friend David reached out with a tip. He told me about an opening at a small, local museum tucked away in the old part of the city. He seemed excited, but I was skeptical.

“Come on, just give it a shot,” he said, sounding way too enthusiastic for someone who knew me. “All you gotta do is keep it clean and tidy, and they actually pay really well. Last week, I made an extra 1k just for staying an hour late.”

I sighed, replying with sarcasm: “Sure, but if this paycheck feels like cartel blood money, I’m out.”

“Oh, stop being so dramatic! Just meet me at the museum tonight at 8, alright?” he said. “And don’t be late, bozo!”

When I arrived at the museum, I took a deep breath, gathered my nerves, and stepped inside. The place was dimly lit, with that weird old-building smell. And there, slouched over in the reception area, was a guy asleep in a chair. I squinted, recognizing him.

“David...?”

I walked over and gave his arm a light shake. “David!”

He jerked awake, mumbling, “Huh? Wha—?”

I couldn’t believe it. “Are you seriously sleeping on the job?” I said, shaking my head.

“So what?” he replied, rubbing his eyes.

“Oh my gosh, David. How many hours did you sleep last night?”

“Like... three?” he said with a yawn.

I groaned. “David, we talked about this! Maybe try putting down the phone before bed, drink some milk, take some magnesium, something? Quit exposing yourself to that blue screen all night.”

He rolled his eyes. “Fine, fine, Daddy-O. Are you happy now?” he said, smirking.

I couldn’t help but chuckle at that. “Yeah, yeah. Now that you’re listening to me for once.”

David stood up, stretching a bit. “But seriously, man,” he said, looking around, “this place is barely held together. The boss, Mr. Boris, he’s... interesting. Chill, but kinda private about the museum’s ‘operations.’ I haven’t figured him out yet.”

“So he’s some kind of mysterious boss?” I replied, eyeing the black-and-yellow caution tape surrounding the gallery on the first floor. The poles supporting the tape were all about half a meter apart, neatly blocking off one section of the hall.

David noticed me eyeing the caution tape and stepped closer. “Whoa there, Daddy-O. We don’t mess with that. Just leave it alone, alright?”

I held my hands up. “Fine, but seriously, doesn’t this all feel... off?”

He looked at me, confused. “What’s ‘off’?”

“Look around! The place is closed off, I’d never even heard of it, and this random ‘caution’ area? Not to mention the mysterious boss you barely know... I dunno, man, it’s just weird.”

David pinched the bridge of his nose, sighing. “Dude, really?”

I shrugged. “Can’t a guy be curious?”

He finally laughed. “Alright, alright. Maybe I’ve been a bit impatient with you. I’m running on fumes here, man. Roll me up and bake me, would you, Daddy-O?”

I burst out laughing. “I’ll eat you raw, cupcake.”

We both cracked up, the silly, weird humor loosening up the tension a bit. After we settled down, I looked at him seriously.

“Okay, but really—what happens now?”

David cleared his throat and adjusted his cap. “Now? Let’s go practice some security protocols,” he said with a wink.

So that’s how it all started. But I had no idea what kind of “protocols” we’d be running into. I just thought I’d share it all here… But looking back, there were signs—little things I should have noticed from the start. But, hey, hindsight’s 20/20, right? So there I was, standing next to David, who was stretching out his back. With a half-grin, he said, “Oh, one more thing... before I take you on the grand security tour as the real pro that I am... I could really go for some coffee. I mean, I’m craving that caffeine right now.""

I raised an eyebrow, shooting him a classic “are you serious right now?” look. David caught my expression and shrugged it off with a lazy grin. “What? It’s not like I’m seriously sleep-deprived, bro.” He waved me off casually and shuffled over to the coffee machine.

I let out a small sigh, watching him walk away. “Whatever, man...” I muttered, flicking my hand dismissively. As he moved further, the lively atmosphere between us faded, replaced by an uncomfortable silence that filled the room.

David’s voice broke through, echoing slightly down the hall. “Be right back! Just gotta get that sweet, sweet dose of today’s finest caffeine.” His footsteps grew distant, each step swallowed by the stillness. Then, right before he disappeared from view, I called out, “Just don’t make me come looking for you,” I muttered with a smirk, knowing he’d catch the tease.

David laughed. “Oh, please. Like you’d drink my bitter coffee over your fancy latte cappuccino.”

“Maybe,” I replied with a mischievous grin. And with that, he vanished down the hall, leaving me alone in the dimly lit gallery. The silence deepened, the air thick with a strange, tense quiet. And that was when I first felt it—that prickling sensation, like someone or something was watching from the shadows.

Always with that freaking coffee—I thought to myself while sitting on a nearby chair. As I waited for my unique 'cinnamon bun' to arrive, I began to wonder: seriously, what’s up with this place? Couldn’t they have put a radio or something inside? Were they really that cheap?

I glanced around at the paintings hanging on the walls. They were nice, I guess, although I didn’t recognize most of them. I sighed, looking at my phone; almost an hour had passed. It was about 21:00. Just then, a message from Aleks, one of my best friends from middle school, popped up on my screen: “Hey. How’s life going?”

Instantly, my mind flooded with nostalgia, and I was momentarily blinded by memories of our past—the endless 3D sandbox trolling we used to do. We were known as “the weird kids,” but we didn’t need any supplements; we were just high on creativity. I replied: “Hey. I'm good, Aleks. You? I'm kinda reconsidering my job choices, lol.”

He responded, “Oh, cool—I guess. Whenever you feel like it, we could always hop on a call and talk like we used to in the past, y'know.” A warm smile spread across my face at the thought of reconnecting. But suddenly, out of nowhere, I froze.

A strange, dropping ""inky"" sound echoed from behind me. I really hope it's just the roof leaking, I thought. My bravado heightened enough for me to turn around, and what I saw left me feeling... confused. Behind all those “caution” stripes, there it was—an exact replica of a famous painting. I could recognize it even without much enthusiasm for art: it was Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa.

As I stepped closer, unease washed over me. The dead silence of the gallery amplified the unsettling sight of the painting, which had been hidden beneath a cloth until now. What’s going on? I thought. My pulse quickened.

I noticed the dissolved towel on the ground, smeared with a black, inky substance. A few drops of it were still dripping from the painting. Curiosity got the better of me; I reached out, my fingertips brushing against the damp towel. A shiver crawled down my spine as I felt a cold sensation in the air, like a breath of icy wind.

Startled, I straightened up and looked back at the painting, and my breath caught in my throat. Something was... wrong. The Mona Lisa’s serene smile seemed a touch too wide, her eyes a bit too knowing. I blinked, telling myself it was just the dim lighting or my imagination playing tricks on me. But as I focused, her expression morphed before my eyes.

What the hell is happening? This cannot be... I screamed in my mind. Her smile stretched unnervingly across her face, lips thickening into a grotesque, exaggerated grin that didn’t belong in any Renaissance portrait. Her dark hair slowly lightened into a vibrant red, each strand seeming to shift as though animated by some unnatural force. Her once-smooth face became angular. This wasn’t possible.

I staggered back, my foot hitting the now-discarded cloth on the floor, its inky black stains smearing under my shoe. I tore my gaze away, trying to catch my breath, when a soft, slithering sound came from behind me. My heart pounded in my chest. As I turned, I half-expected to see David standing there with his usual grin. But the only thing staring back at me from the darkness was the emptiness of the hall, the silence weighing heavy around me. 

And then, when I finally dared to look back at the painting, she was gone.",1,1730774344.0,u_NocturnKeeper_Offic,0,1.0,False

My mom has been living with relatives, namely her brother and his wife. Their daughter just got married, and they have been kinda twisting her arm to sell the house as soon as possible. They used to respond to my texts and she did too more frequently but since I voiced my opinion that my mother keep her disgusting but beloved home to finally fix it up and sell it at a worthy price (invest ~250k, home is worth easily .5mil if sold in good condition), it has basically been radio silence. 

Don't get me wrong. It's weirdly vindicating to watch this unfold. I have an inkling they want any money faster so they can take it to pay for my cousin's wedding. They can vilify us and sit on the high horse while my mom's memory and free agancy wanes further. She doesn't even remember much for more than a few minutes and has been struggling with the concept that she can no longer control the situation. The city has seen it and it is either sell it to someone who will fix it, fix it ourselves, or condemnation, seizure and probably fines. I have a feeling they don't want to hear my opinion especially because it is the same as my dad's, and they despise him. Just for him divorcing my mom... But she made us grow up in squalor! and now all those precious belongings she cared about more than us will go to making my cousin's sweet life even sweeter!! My dad brought me some of my residual belongings from my spaces in the house. I think of stuff everynday I want to reclaim from the mess. I think of all the times I tried to clean or offered financial assistance for services to fix the many problems in the house (it is condemnable and everything that was there REEKED of mold for weeks after removal...heck, when my fiancé and I first left our stay in that house our coffee maker looked like a petri dish when we brought it into the heat and light of day from the basement!). I live states away from all that and have kids of my own now that I honestly don't care if my mom ever gets to meet. Some days I want to forgive her and then I remember that I actually laughed out loud when I heard the house had burnt. Apparently 1 in every 3 deaths from fire in America are in/result of hoarded homes. 

I mean, it IS a fitting end. It's bittersweet, and ironic in a million ways. I guess I am just glad that house won't cast a shadow over us any longer by physical presence and maybe we can all move on and forget how this XL sized token of neglect mouldered away our souls as children.

Hey fellow devs! I just wanted to share my experience of building the game with AI, along with some brutal honesty about indie dev life.

It all started with me procrastinating by listening to Antoine van der Lee's podcast (anyone else learning Swift from his blog since forever?). They were discussing this 2-2-2 approach: validate in 2 hours, prototype in 2 days, release in 2 weeks. In my infinite wisdom, since I have a bit of free time I decided ""Hey, why not build 5 apps by the end of 2024?"" Yeah, I know, I know...

# The Idea

Was binging Netflix's ""Devil's Plan"" - a show where contestants compete in various mental challenges (great show btw), and there was this word association game that looked fun. Couldn't find anything similar on the App Store, so classic dev move - ""I'll build it myself!""

# The AI Experiment

Decided to go all-in with AI. Although I've been using an unofficial Copilot extension for XCode for quite a while, for this project, I decided to use primarily Cursor with Claude Sonnet model and Sweetpad extension, and holy - it actually worked decently well. Gave it the game rules, and 15 minutes later had a working prototype with all the views, models, game logic separated into different files. Sure, it looked like it was designed by a backend developer (first screenshot), but it worked...kinda. It took me the remaining 7 days to iterate, adjust, tweak and build on top of it to bring it to a production level.

# The Reality Check

Current user base:

1. Me
2. Also me (on simulator)
3. My partner (bless her)
4. My mom (who's still trying to figure out how to sign in)
5. Probably the App Store reviewer

But hey, that's 5 users more than yesterday! 😅

# The Tech Side

* SwiftUI + MVVM + semi-clean architecture (because we're all proper developers here)
* Firebase: Authentication, FireStore, RemoteConfigs (because what's an indie app without Firebase?)
* Mixpanel (to track those massive user numbers)
* RevenueCat (I know, overkill for my 0 purchases so far)

# Working with AI - The Good, Bad, and Weird

Think of AI as that junior dev who sometimes has brilliant ideas and sometimes makes you question everything. It's like pair programming, but your partner doesn't drink your coffee or judge your variable names.

Good stuff:

* Built a prototype in 15 minutes (would've taken me 2 days of overthinking)
* Created a tag cloud view in seconds (saved me from a StackOverflow deep dive)
* Actually decent UI suggestions (I kept most of the initial UI)

The ""interesting"" parts:

* Jumping between Xcode and Cursor like a caffeinated kangaroo
* AI: ""Here's your feature!"" Me: ""Cool, but can you make it... actually work?""
* Made a huge backlog of ""nice-to-have"" features (that I'll totally get to...someday)

# Honest Lessons Learned

1. Building with AI is surprisingly fun. It's like having a very eager intern who occasionally writes better code than you.
2. Shipped in 7 days (about 40-60 hours). Could I have done it faster without AI? Maybe, but would I have enjoyed it as much? Nope!
3. The app icon is... well, it's a devil created in Midjourney with ""WORDS"" slapped on in Photoshop. Design is my passion™️

# The App Itself

* No ads, no subs (because I don't expect any profit, it's just for fun)
* Just pure, simple word gaming with minimal UI design
* Available now on the App Store. You can search **Devil's Words Association Game**. Or here is a [link](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/devils-words-association-game/id6737246063?pt=2248795&ct=reddit.iosprogramming.05112024&mt=8)

# What's Next?

If I somehow hit 1000 downloads (currently at 5, so... getting there!), I'll add some fancy animations and features from my massive backlog. Until then, I'm moving on to app #2 of my 5-app challenge. So stay tuned.

Would love your feedback:

* How far did you get before rage quitting or getting dead bored and deleting the app?
* How does the UI/UX fill? Is the UI too minimal or just minimal enough?
* Any features you'd want to see?
* Should I give up and do web dev instead? 😅... Nah, I've been an iOS developer since iOS4, I may think about quiting on iOS49.

# The Philosophical Bit

Is AI replacing developers? Nah...or maybe... NAAAH! Is it making development more fun and slightly less painful? Absolutely. It's like having a rubber duck that actually talks back and sometimes writes code better and faster than you do.

Let me know if you want to hear more about specific parts of the development process, or try the app and tell me where you got stuck. Also accepting suggestions for a less terrible app icon! 🙏",11,1730773933.0,iOSProgramming,7,0.92,False

1gjwesp,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlieTheTraveler/comments/1gjwesp/greece_country_highlights_creating_a_solid/,"Greece: Country Highlights & Creating a Solid Itinerary
","Below is an article I wrote in which I explained where in Greece I think you should visit, how much time I think you should spend at each of these recommended destinations and the order in which to visit these destinations. Feel free to direct message me if you need help.



Formally introduced as the “Cradle of Western Civilization,’ yet commonly known for its incredibly alluring and diverse islands, Greece offers a healthy balance between history and heritage on one hand and Mediterranean-style leisure and partying on the other. Greece is home of architectural jewels such as Corfu Town, Chania in Crete, Rhodes Town and the Cycladic Islands. The country also features a seemingly endless array of archeological treasures (e.g. the Acropolis and Parthenon), striking monasteries (especially Meteora and Mount Athos), plenty of hiking (e.g. Samaria Gorge), and even skiing (especially Arachova) opportunities.



As for those who simply want to vacation, Greece has long been a favorite among families and revelers alike. Greece has the twelfth longest shoreline in the world and neither tourists nor locals waste an opportunity to have some fun in the sun. Of course, there are plenty of islands as well as areas along the mainland’s coast that provide for a quiet stay. However, if looking for some of Southern Europe’s most vibrant beach bars and nightlife, then Greece will be an ideal destination for you. To describe Greece in only one sentence, it is a country that cherishes its past, lives for the present, and plans as if only to party.



Days 1-3: Start your trip to Greece in Rhodes. 3 days suffice, including the early morning arrival from abroad, ideally from Fethiye, Turkey. Fethiye is only a 1.5-hour boat ride away. Rhodes Town is a great base from which to explore the island. Renting a car is necessary.



A medieval town protected by fortification and graced by a maze of streets featuring inviting restaurants, cafés and shops, the UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the beautiful island capital that is Rhodes Town - an architectural gem of the Aegean Sea. Other treasures of this fairly populace and self-sustaining island include the village of Lindos and its acropolis, castles, archeological remains, rocky and scenic mountains, exotic beaches, and clear and calm waters along the southern coast.



Taken as a whole, Rhodes successfully balances its heritage with being a tourist-friendly and relatively well-organized destination. Noteworthy, however, is that the northern coast has given way to package tourism. At least in July, and especially August when tourists pack the island, this area is best known for its resorts, windsurfing activities, and hot-and-heavy nightlife. Ultimately, Rhodes is what you want it to be: a paradise for partygoers, a retreat for families, and/or an island home of rich culture and well-preserved traditions.



Day 4: Make a daytrip via a 1.5-hour boat ride to Symi. This island has become a haven for tourists from abroad, especially from the United Kingdom and Italy. The influx of tourists has led to the restoration of a great number of homes, many of which were destroyed during World War II.





Day 5: Take a quick and early-morning flight from Rhodes to the town of Heraklion, Crete. Renting a car is necessary. Heraklion is home of an archeological site called Knossos. Next, take a 1.5-hour drive to the village of Matala, home of great beaches and caves. Lastly, take a 1-hour and 45-minute drive to the charming town of Rethymno. There you can do a little sightseeing, have a nice dinner and enjoy some evening entertainment. The ride to the town of Chania from Rethymno takes about 1 hour. While on Crete Island, base yourself in Chania.



Missing from today’s itinerary is a stop in Plakias, also home of some great beaches. If you really want to squeeze Plakias in, then from Matala you could take a 1.5-hour drive to reach it. You could then go from Plakias to Rethymno via a 45-minute drive.



Day 6: As a daytrip, take a 1.5-hour drive to Samaria Gorge. There you can do some hiking. Afterwards, return to Chania and do an evening stroll around town.



Day 7: Make a daytrip to the western side of Crete. Take a 45-minute drive to Kissamos, followed by a 1-hour boat ride to Imeri Gramvousa. This small island hosts the remains of a Venetian fort as well as of buildings left behind by Cretan insurgents who were compelled to live as pirates during the Greek War of Independence. After exploring the sites, relaxing at the beach, and returning to the mainland, take a 1-hour drive to the island of Elafonisi. When the weather is fine it is possible to walk from the mainland to the island through the shallow water. The drive from Elafonisi back to Chania takes about 1.5 hours.



Day 8: Explore the charming town of Chania.



Perhaps most atmospheric at night when the many bars and romantic restaurants light up along the shores and under the stars, Chania is home of a charming port that serves some of the tastiest food in all of Greece. Surrounding this historic town are streets containing boutique hotels, as well as shops that commonly illustrate Crete’s fascination with artisanship. Venetian in style yet complimented by Ottoman features, Chania is not only Crete’s most architecturally attractive destination but it is also the ideal location in Crete to use as a base from which to explore the central and western parts of the island. If you seek an authentic experience, then you should lodge in the nightlife-rich old town rather than the outlying beach areas where the package tourists tend to stay.



Days 9-11: Take a 2-hour speed boat ride from Heraklion, Crete to Santorini. 3 days of exploring the island suffice, including the afternoon arrival from Heraklion. Renting a car or motorbike is necessary. On the third day make sure to include a visit via a quick ferry ride to the volcanic island of Nea Kameni.



Whitewashed and pastel-colored cubic buildings and blue-domed churches seemingly pile onto one another, cling onto the cliff-side caves of a caldera to form a dramatic landscape and striking views in what is one of the most unique destinations on earth. Especially in the villages of Thira and Oia, one can wander through a labyrinth of narrow and stone-paved alleyways filled with seasonally vibrant taverns and cafes as well as boutique shops and hotels. In these very same alleyways, you can find some pretty vibrant nightlife in the summertime.



Cycladic in style yet complimented by some neoclassical elements, Santorini is every photographer’s fantasy. With its villages perched several hundreds of feet above water, adding to this volcanic island’s allure is a stunning and world renowned-sunset, best viewed from Oia. Now throw into the mix locally produced and internationally acclaimed wines, scuba diving activities, archeological remains, and beaches with sand or pebbles made of solidified lava of various colors (e.g. Red Beach). Suddenly you have what is one of the most romanticized - and unsurprisingly visited - islands in all the Mediterranean.



Days 12-13: Take a 2-hour speed boat ride from Santorini to Paros. 2 days of exploring the island suffice, including the early morning arrival from Santorini. Renting a car or motorbike is necessary.



Paros looks and feels exactly like a quintessential Greek island: a maze of blue and white buildings packed with all kinds of shops, romantic restaurants dotted along the calm and clear sea, stars shining from far above, and music that makes reality temporarily forgotten – and that’s just a description of the old town. Perhaps even more of a draw is the beach scene. Although not as world renowned as nearby Mykonos, Paros is no less enticing. Whether you seek rest and relaxation or whether you enjoy wondering aimlessly, this relatively small island would be a great choice for you.



Days 14-15: Take a 1-hour speed boat ride from Paros to Mykonos. 2 days of exploring the island suffice, including the early morning arrival from Paros. Renting a car or motorbike is necessary. If you have extra time on your hand, then consider visiting via a 30-minute boat ride the ruins in the island of Delos.



Now famed for seasonally hosting some of the best beach parties and nightlife in all the Mediterranean as well as featuring an exciting fashion scene combined with stylish bars, restaurants and shops, what initially put Mykonos under the international spotlight is its clear and calm waters and quintessential Cycladic architecture: whitewashed cubic buildings, a labyrinth of narrow and stone-paved alleyways, and numerous little churches dotted around town. Although Mykonos is one of Greece’s chicest and most visited destinations, the island usually only feels overcrowded in July, especially in August, and sometimes in September. Visit Mykonos virtually any other time of the year and experience an island as authentically Greek as anywhere “off the beaten path.”



Day 16: Make a daytrip via a 1-hour boat ride to the island of Syros.



The town of Ermoupoli stands on a naturally amphi-theatrical site, with neo-classical buildings, old mansions and white houses cascading down to the harbor. The City Hall is where Miaoulis Square lies, ringed with cafes and with seating areas under palm trees. Ano Syros is the second town of Syros and was built by the Venetians at the beginning of the 13th century. Ano Syros maintains a medieval atmosphere. Innumerable steps between narrow streets and houses with colored doors lead to the top of the town. The Catholic cathedral of Saint George dominates Ano Syros. From the cathedral visitors have a panoramic view of the neighboring islands of Tinos, Delos, Mykonos, Paros, Andros and Naxos.



Day 17: Take an early morning, 4-hour speed boat ride from Mykonos to Athens. Only spend that same day exploring the capital, with the key attractions being the ancient citadel of Acropolis and its museum, the Hellenic Parliament building, a flea market called ‘Monastiraki’ and the Plaka neighborhood.



Day 18: Make an early morning daytrip from Athens to an archeological site called Delphi via a 3-hour drive or an organized bus tour. The trip is a bit fatiguing but is still the best option. Ideally, it would be nice to relocate to Delphi and a couple of days later head north. In reality, this is complicated, that is, unless you rent a car.



Days 19-20: Take a 5-hour bus or preferably train ride from Athens to Kalabaka, home of an Eastern Orthodox monastery complex site called Meteora. 2 days suffice, including the afternoon arrival from Athens.



One of the largest and most impressive Eastern Orthodox complexes in all of Greece, Meteora is home of stunning monasteries perched onto surreal-looking and seemingly unapproachable sandstone rock pillars (there are steps).  You will need a full day to visit all six monasteries. Note: some of them may be closed depending on when you go. Make sure to begin your day bright and early. Majestic Meteora is a place known to put visitors in touch with both nature and spirituality. Those who wish to stay near to the complex commonly base themselves in Kalabaka.



Days 21-23: Although you could use public buses, it is best to rent a car and take a 2.5-hour drive to Igoumenitsa. From this port town take a 1.5-hour boat ride to the island of Corfu. Including the afternoon arrival from Igoumenitsa, 3 days suffice, one of which to do some sightseeing in the town itself and the rest to explore the island. Renting a car is necessary.



Venetian in appearance yet mostly dating from the neoclassical British period, the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Corfu Town is characterized by its palaces, churches, maze of narrow and stone-paved streets, squares, seashore promenade, trendy restaurants and cafes, and its two imposing castles that provide clear views of it all. What’s more, the town is the capital of a small and mountainous island that features verdant scenery, exotic beaches, and clear waters. Seasonally popular Corfu is otherwise known for exceptional nightlife.



Corfu became one of the first-visited islands during Greece’s tourism boom in the 1960s. Although areas of Corfu fell to mass commercialism and overdevelopment, fortunately the island still provides many natural and unspoiled charms. Package tourists tend to lodge outside of the capital. If you are seeking an authentic experience, then you should find accommodation in the old town. Here is where you are likely to meet some of the most cultured and friendly islanders in all of Greece.



Day 24: Make a daytrip from Corfu to the islands of Paxos and nearby Antipaxos via a 1.5-hour boat ride. The west coast of Paxos is dominated by steep white, chalky cliffs that are greatly eroded at sea level. Paxos harbors many 'blue caves', which can be explored on launches departing from Gaios. Antipaxos is famous for its wine as well as for two of the finest sand beaches in the Ionian Sea.



Day 25: Take a quick flight to Thessaloniki. 1 day suffices as long as you arrive early enough from Corfu. Rent a car at the airport. Thessaloniki isn’t as popular for its architecture as it is for its distinct culture, local cuisine, and incredible nightlife scene. If you want to experience big city Greece at its most authentic, then head to the country’s second largest city.



Day 26: Make a daytrip to popular beaches located less than 25 kilometers south of Thessaloniki: Perea, Agia Triada, and Asprovalta.



Day 27: Make a daytrip via a 2.5-hour drive to Mount Athos, a mountainous peninsula that is home of twenty striking Eastern Orthodox monasteries. Head for Ouranoupolis, from where early morning boat trips depart. Many tourists simply do a one-day boat trip excursion because a permit is needed to enter the area. How quickly the permit is granted varies greatly from days to months. The other thing to consider is while men are allowed onto the land with a permit, women are denied access altogether.



My girlfriend at the time and I decided to relocate to a village closer to Ouranoupolis rather than make a daytrip from Thessaloniki. The day we had arrived, most hotels and bed & breakfast establishments were fully booked. We had not booked a room in advance. I went to a travel agency to seek help. An agent linked me up with a local who showed me a photo of his hotel. My girlfriend and I went to his place and were unpleasantly surprised. It was his mom’s home. The place had absolutely nothing to do with the photo this guy showed me. I don’t know why I went inside to have a look at his place, but I just did. He showed us both his personal room and his sister’s. He said that my girlfriend and I could sleep in the bed with him or his sister. The guy was nuts - but hilarious in his own bizarre way. My girlfriend and I finally found a family bed & breakfast.



The next problem, the next day, involved a boat cruising along Mount Athos’ coastline also being full. We tried to get on, hoping for a last-minute cancellation. Not only did we not get on, but even people who had paid for tickets were denied entry. The company had overbooked. Since we still wanted to do the tour that same day, our only option was to embark upon another boat from a port approximately 1 hour away.



Taxis were too expensive. A travel agent I met had an acquaintance drive us for a lower amount. This guy was nuts, even worse than the guy who wanted me to sleep with his sister. He kept smoking, drinking coffee, and directly looking at us rather than on the road as he was talking nonstop. I almost begged him to stay focused. He said that he had a drunk-driving accident some years prior, as if that would make me feel like we weren’t going to crash. He told me not to worry, as he knew the roads using his eyes, ears, and heart. He made absolutely no sense whatsoever. Thank God we made it to the port safely. We got onto the boat and did a great tour.



Not Included in the Greece Itinerary



Solely due to logistics, not included in the itinerary is a visit to Monemvasia.



Uninterrupted by modern structures, Peloponnese’s own Monemvasia is a partially fortified and charming village that clings onto a relatively high and rocky mountain. This natural landmark is sprinkled with rather colorful and diverse flowers, is romantically illuminated at night, and offers great views of the old medieval town. No less attractive are the clean, clear, and calm waters running along Monemvasia and far beyond. If all that isn’t enough, thanks to its location within the agricultural heartland of this historic nation, Monemvasia is home of some of the Mediterranean's richest cuisine - wines, seafood, vegetables, and fruits. Near the rocky mountain, and right across the bridge, is a “new town,” where local dishes are best enjoyed while dining along the pebbly beaches. Almost anyone who visits this underrated destination will quickly discover that it ranks among Greece’s finest.



Also not included in the itinerary is the island of Milos, which boasts the most beautiful beaches in the region. It is highly recommended you visit Milos after Santorini and before Paros. Milos is a 2.5-hour boat ride away from Santorini and a 3.5-hour boat ride away from Paros. It is recommended you spend 2 full days in Milos. Rent a car. Sleep at a hotel near to the port.



First head to a beach called Paliochori. There you should start a boat ride along the southern coastline. Highlights include the beaches at Agia Kiriaki, Tsigrado, Firiplaka, Provatas, Kleftiko and Sikia. After the boat ride, head to a beach called Thiorichia. There you can have breathtaking views of the coastline. The following day, the first destination should be the village of Klima. There you can see cute homes built right along the coastline. Next, take a 5-minute drive to a catacombs archeological site. The guided tour there takes around 15 minutes. After this tour, go by foot to the nearby ancient amphitheater followed by foot to the nearby church overlooking the town.



Next, take a 10-minute drive to a beach called Firopotamos. It is recommended you simply have a look and do not go swimming yet. Next, take a 5-minute drive to a beach called Mantrakia. It is recommended you purchase lunch at the restaurant there. After your meal, take a 10-minute drive to a beach called Papafragas. There you have a great viewpoint of the coastline. Next, take a 5-minute drive to a beach called Alogomandra. It is recommended you swim there for about 15 minutes. Next, drive to a beach called Sarakiniko. This is the greatest beach of them all in Milos. It is recommended you spend a couple of hours there. After Sarakiniko, take a 10-minute drive to the village of Plaka. There you should take a 15-minute hike to a viewpoint overlooking the village. It is from this viewpoint you are to watch the sunset.



Also not included in the itinerary are the islands of Lefkada and Zakynthos. If you wish to add them, it is recommended to do so after visiting Corfu and before visiting Thessaloniki. From Corfu, take a 6-hour boat ride to Lefkada. After Lefkada, take a 7-hour boat ride to Zakynthos. After Zakynthos, take a flight to Thessaloniki. Lefkada and Zakynthos are both known for their beaches, which may be the nicest in all of Greece. You will need to rent a car to explore both of these islands.



For exploring Zakynthos, visit the island in this specific order:



1. Banana Beach (have a quick look)

2. Keri Beach Viewpoint

3. Shipwreck Beach Viewpoint (near to Saint George Monastery)

1gjwdtg,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1gjwdtg/zoologist_perfumes_34_samples_and_short_reviews/,Zoologist Perfumes: 34 samples and short reviews,"I love Zoologist for its intentions and its vision. They make beautiful, thoughtful, unique and interesting fragrances. There is something for everyone in this house, and I can’t recommend enough that you seize the opportunity to sample as many of their fragrances that you can. One thing that I needed to adjust to was the use of incense in many of these fragrances. Be prepared for that and you might fall in love with these!
Performance key: weak < acceptable (4-6hrs) < adequate (6-7hrs) < strong (8 hrs) < godly (9+hrs)

Beaver (maple)
Solid opening with a pronounced maple note on the top. Dry down is green, grassy and earthy. The vetiver is pronounced with this one. A bit mossy as well. No sweetness nor ozonic notes to balance out this green and earthy fragrance. Performance is adequate. It’s a 6.5/10 for me.

Snowy owl
Light, airy, slightly floral (lily of the valley), not very animalic. Pronounced mint note on top. Also a green vegetal note in there, reminiscent of nautica voyage (cucumber?). Very balanced and interesting. Unisex. Dry down is a bit ozonic and sunscreeny, somewhat like sailing day replica by Margiela. Performance is adequate. Artful in its execution, although it’s not really for me. 6.5/10

Panda
Top 5 of the house for me. Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful dirty jasmine note that smells intoxicating on my skin. Slightly sweet, floral and very strong performer. It radiates and lasts 8+ hours. Artfully balanced, floral and unisex. I guess some would call it a well-made “oriental” style fragrance. 9/10 for me. Highly considering a bottle.

Hyrax
By far the most challenging of the entire house for me. It’s the strongest of the animalic frags. It smells strongly of civet and barnyard notes, with a dry, stony note that heightens the strength of the funkiness. I can’t really see anybody pulling this one off. I’ll keep the sample as a gag scent for the homies to sniff because it’s so unique. 10/10 for its unmitigated gall, but a 1/10 in terms of overall desirability and wearability. The performance is godly. I’ll smell remnants of this on my arm after 30+ hours. 

Rabbit
A delightful and artistic gourmand. Beautifully nutty, sweet and delicious though not in a conventional sense. Most gourmands smell cakey, vanilic and sickeningly sweet, but this is very nutty, not too sweet, and also has a faint carrot note. It’s very versatile and I like it a lot. It leans feminine. Performance is adequate. 7.5/10 

Camel
Another one of my favorites. Strong animalic barn notes in the mid, with warm, dry spices in the base that are seductive and beautiful. The oud accentuates the barn smell but it works so well with the bold spices. Dry down is gorgeous and feels altogether different from the top and mid. It combines a traditional, more middle Eastern-feeling fragrance with some more animalic notes. Performance is strong. 9/10 contemplating a bottle since I have nothing like this in my collection.

Bat
Probably my favorite. It’s a funky fruity top that smells like hot berries starting to go bad. It’s a little leathery and dark, perfect for an evening fragrance. Somehow it’s masculine but flirty and seductive. It’s not too sweet either. Dry down is somehow fougere and undeniably masculine. Performance is acceptable, less than I like, maybe lasts 6 hours. 9/10 might have to get a bottle of this.

Rhinocerous
Deeply masculine, leathery and boozy (whiskey) with a green, grassy vetiver note. Dry down does not fit my skin chemistry, but I can see some people really liking it. It’s odd, the leather and booze make it feel evening, but the grassy makes it feel spring and daytime. This is the opposite of a light freshy. Performance is strong. 5/10

Penguin
This one is really fascinating from the sensory aspect. It smells like snowy air. Not as cooling as snowy owl, but I can’t describe it any other way than that it just smells like melting snowy air. I’m not sure about how this performs, I feel like it is somewhat weak on performance. 8/10 how did they do this?

T-Rex
Really well done and deeply true to its name. Smoke, ash, leather, metallic blood. Deeply spiced with frankincense, masculine, spicy, mysterious yet dominating. Ideal for evenings and cool weather. Not super date night worthy unless you’re naturally bold and not flirty. Performance is godly. 8/10 very cool frag.

Sloth 
This is an interesting one. It’s deeply green, and somewhat…medicinal? It’s very non-linear and the dry down smells like a clean and somewhat fresh frag, oddly enough. I like this one a lot. Performance is acceptable. 8/10

Bee
Everyone loves this one but it’s so not for me. Deeply incensey, floral honey and sweet. Drydown smells like Catholic Church service and old ladies and fermenting sugar. This is one of those examples of how some of the zoologist fragrances have too much incense in some of their fragrances for my taste. Performance is godly. 4/10 

Moth
This one is so interesting, and, to me, so unlikable. It’s got all the qualities of old moth balls and dust. The clove, nutmeg and cumin with iris is such a strange and unique combo. It smells like a musty suit found at the bottom of an estate sale with some sweetness on top. It’s really cool though. Performance is strong. It doesn’t smell nearly as sweet as I’ve heard other reviewers say of it. 3/10

Squid
Oddly warm spicy to my nose. I’m not sure I can really detect a squid ink note. Almost like an unsweetened angels share? It’s nice and I see the appeal, but the dry down is a bit one note for me. It doesn’t make me think of squid at all if I’m being honest. Performance is strong. 5.5/10

Seahorse
This one is nice. It’s somehow watery yet also airy/ozonic. It’s also floral with an unmistakable neroli note. It reminds me a little bit of sailing day by Margiela with a twist of Tom Ford Neroli Portofino. If you like snowy owl, you might enjoy this one as well. Dry down becomes a bit powdery which is not my favorite. The floral accord is lovely though. Performance is adequate. 7.5/10

Tiger
This one is interesting. It’s kind of similar to Terre dhermes in my opinion, but grassier and greener with less citrus, with a sweeter and more floral opening. I love the vetiver and jasmine in this one, but performance was weak on my skin. If I didn’t already have Terre dhermes, I’d consider a bottle. 8/10

Macaque (yuzu)
This is a beautiful, soft fougere, barbershop fragrance. The fuzzy and soft, relaxing hinoki wood note is gorgeous and a relaxing touch to a traditional oakmoss and hydrocarbonic aerosol fragrance. The yuzu is short lived, unfortunately. Dry down is masculine and safe smelling. Performance is acceptable. 7/10

Macaque (Apple)
Virtually identical to macaque yuzu, but with a yummy, sweet apple note right on top. It lasts for about an hour on my skin as well before it dries down to another classic barbershop, shaving cream fougere. I love fougeres but I have a ton of them and can buy them for super cheap. This is a little more flirty though with the fruity top note. Performance is acceptable. 7.5/10

Dodo (jackfruit edition)
This is exactly what a classic fougere smells like. Shaving cream, through and through, but with a tiny hint of baby powder. Similar to macaque yuzu but it projects more and is a little bit spicier. The fermenty jackfruit top note is awesome but short lived. Clean and masculine. Very likable and unobjectionable. Dare I say…somewhat uninteresting for a niche frag? I might catch heat for that. It’s still beautiful and well made. Performance is adequate. 7.5/10 as a fougere lover, I just have way too many fougeres and fougere-adjacent fragrances to buy this one.

Northern cardinal
This is beautiful. It’s fruity, floral and cedar all in one delightful fragrance. The oakmossy, cedar finish with the more feminine, fruity top makes this unique and unisex. I haven’t smelled anything with this profile before. My wife and I both really like this one. It’s very versatile and could be used throughout all seasons. Performance is acceptable. 8.5/10 you could twist my arm to get a bottle of this

Elephant
Very green and unisex. Grassy, leafy on the top with a smooth, slightly sweet coconut dry down. This one is likeable, not too animalic of any, and is also very versatile. The incense is pronounced in this one and can be jarring at first if you’re not familiar with fragrances with incense. Performance is acceptable and the dry down is smooth. 7/10 

King cobra
This one smells like another masculine, barbershop fougere. It smells a bit like arrid xx aerosol and a little bit of Armani code, but without the overt sweetness and a hearty note of vetiver to make it interesting. I can see an older gentleman (45+) feeling nostalgic and liking this one. Very middle of the road for me. As a man, I think I could wear it and get through the day without turning too many heads. It’s well-made and longevity is there. Performance is adequate. 7/10

Koala 
Holy eucalyptus! This borders on medicinal with the strength of green eucalyptus in the opening. It’s only amplified by the menthol notes as well. I like this one as it’s really interesting, yet I feel somewhat confused by it. It has traditional fougere (oakmoss) and traditional “oriental” notes (vanilla), yet somehow it works out better than I imagined it would. The dry down is smooth and creamy with the vanilla. Performance is acceptable, and it’s very non linear. Solid 7.5/10 someone will love this one.

Dragonfly
Absolutely gorgeous and interesting. To me it smells like a dewdrop in a fantasy movie. Deeply aquatic, floral, green and fresh. Somewhat melon-ey as well. Performance is adequate. I love this one and want my wife to love it so that I can smell it on her. 9/10

Chameleon
It’s a HARD NO for me. It’s triggering. You might love this if you love Tom Ford F*cking Fabulous, but to me it’s a deeply unlikeable smell of baby wipes with funky diaper bin on top. I didn’t dislike it as much the first time I tried it, but the 2nd time, it resonated very poorly with me. This is a deeply opinionated take. It’s probably not as bad or as divisive as I find it, but I can’t get past my emotional reaction toward it. I like some more animalic fragrances but the fresh florals mixed with this one are so unsettling. Performance is adequate. 2/10 no no no.

Nightingale
Oooooooo, this is pretty. I normally am not a rose/oud enjoyer, but this is nice on the opening. Floral and dark with the oud touch. Some might find this one objectionable as it is retro feeling and oud can be divisive. Dry down is a little mothbally or dry and musty. This feels ideal for evenings. It has a mysteriousness to it that I find enjoyable. Performance is adequate and nonlinear.  7.5/10

Hummingbird
This is beautiful. It’s like diving into a bowl of fruit punch. Super fruity and sweet on the top. I grew up in a place where honeysuckle grows wild in the spring, and this has a GORGEOUS honeysuckle note in there that I’m in love with. It’s nothing revolutionary, but I also have a soft spot for hummingbirds, so the marketing is working on me. Performance is acceptable, suitable for day/spring.  8/10 really enjoy this.

Cockatiel
This is unlike anything I’ve smelled before. It’s floral forward, powdery and solar. I do not detect the champagne in this one too much. Maybe the vanilla and rhubarb mixing together make an accord that I’m so unfamiliar with. The first time I smelled this, I almost thought it smelled like new furniture or like drywall. I can’t think of any other way to explain it. Maybe that doesn’t make any sense. Performance is acceptable and it’s versatile to wear during the day, regardless of season. 6.5/10 interesting but maybe not for me.

Musk deer
This is a nice barbershop fougere in my opinion. Slightly animalic but not overpowering. Smooth and slightly sweet. I’m usually very challenged with oud and rose fragrances, but this one is blended in a way that is very palatable to me. The creamy sandalwood and jasmine smooth this musky fragrance perfectly. Surprisingly this one doesn’t perform as strong as I’d like, as it’s only acceptable. 7.5/10 

Cow
Delightfully fresh and has a delicious apple note on top. Not nearly as lactonic as I thought It’d be. It’s slightly lactonic and that is bolstered with the pop of sage on the top. It’s unlike anything you might find at a Sephora in that it combines a fruity cleanliness with a sagey, milky blend. Dry down is sweet and dry. I like this one a lot, and performance is adequate. 8/10

Chipmunk
This is a delightfully green, woody and grassy fragrance that is rooted in fougere, barbershop masculine notes. There are pachouli, pink pepper and cedar notes that work really well on my skin chemistry. It’s versatile and not challenging at all to me. Performance is adequate. 8/10 

Harvest mouse
This is a really nice fragrance. It balances warm nutty sweet gourmand with interesting notes of beer and wheat. Some might think it smells a little bit medicinal for its clovy nutmeg notes. Usually vanilla forward fragrances are not my cup of tea, but everything mixed with this makes it really enjoyable. In the end the dry down is sweet, gourmand and nutty. Maybe a bit like rabbit but slightly more spiced. This is a nice one. Performance is adequate. 7.5/10

Civet
This is challenging not for its animalic nature, but for its syrupy dry down. It does not do well with my skin chemistry in the slightest.  It’s weirdly sweet yet not honey or sugar sweet. The resins and coffee and vanilla all mixed together lay heavy on my skin and bring out a funk that is unappealing to my nose. Performance is strong. 4/10

Sacred scarab
Really nice. I like the warm sweet spicy fruitiness here. There is a palpable animalic note of civet to cut through everything. Deep and rich yet somewhat airy at the same time? Really well balanced between clean, spicy and dirty. I can see this one being well received by a masculine crowd. Performance is strong. 8/10 camel wins by just a smidge for me.",31,1730773721.0,fragrance,15,0.97,False

I recently got accepted into LSA as a transfer student for the winter semester from a community college where I have an associate’s degree (did early college in hs). I’m interested in going into biomedical engineering, and multiple people told me to apply to LSA and then transfer to the CoE. 

I haven’t taken any classes very specific to my major, so if I get into it and end up hating it my second “major of interest” would probably be pre-dental. I live in Michigan and plan on commuting to campus. 

I’m currently taking Calc III and Calc-Based Physics I. I’m doing pretty well in both of those classes rn, but I have exams coming up for physics and am worried about the class. The worst case scenario is that I fail, and I’m wondering if that happens what are the chances that I get my acceptance revoked. I’ve never got below a 3.5 in any college class. If I end up doing bad and had to retake the class I know I would do a lot better. My physics professor says our class is MIT level and it’s hard so we can be able to transfer it to any college.

I’m very into music, I play bass guitar and percussion but most enjoy playing in jazz ensembles. My other most significant hobby is arts and crafts, specifically sewing and crochet. I also roller skate and am consumed by fashion. Some hobbies I want to dive deeper into are reading, running, learning different instruments, language learning, and shuffle dance. 

So if there’s any cool clubs, extracurriculars, or places (specifically coffee shops) in Ann Arbor that might fit these interests please let me know. ",4,1730773677.0,uofm,0,0.7,False

1gjw9st,https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1gjw9st/iaa_oshawa_insurance_company_stole_my_stuff/,IAA Oshawa (Insurance company stole my stuff?),"Hello, I dearly need help with this. 

So unfortunately, I was at fault when driving a rental vehicle from enterprise & I was involved in a crash on September 30th of this year. No other passengers involved. Furthermore; a deeper investigation that night led to me being detained for a months time and the vehicle was towed by a company named ""JP towing"" later that morning. 
The police had taken evidence from the vehicle & then the vehicle was taken to JP's lot. 
I was unaware of this while incarcerated; as all of my belongings in the truck needed to be obtained still. 

On October 28th I was released on bail and conditions to my own faults. 
I contacted the police and they told me the property from the vehicle was ready to be claimed from JP towing , so off I went to JP. (Across the map from the crash scene.) 

When I got to the tow yard/ the man clerk was very confused as to what vehicle I was referring to as the truck was not at their yard anymore & had actually been gone since the 3rd of October. 
Being as enterprise picked it up at 10:30pm October 3rd. It arrived at JP towing October 3rd at 2:30pm and left from there with enterprise knowledge. 
It then got taken wherever (with my belongings) and somehow ended up at IAA in Oshawa. 

So I called IAA , and explained the situation. 
Also called the police and told them that they gave me wrong information. They told me to go to IAA for my belongings ; as did enterprise. 
Enterprise was emailing IAA supposedly, to track my belongings. 

While speaking to IAA, I spoke to a woman that told me that the truck had come in & was purchased already- but hasn't left the lot. 
So I asked about my belongings and they never got back to me & denied my calls when telling me they would call me back. 
I waited all weekend. 


Now , I  hadn't heard back since Friday this last week , so this morning I called IAA. The same lady then told me that they recovered my belongings from the truck and it was picked up by the buyer. 
I asked when I could come and pick up my belongings - she said as soon as possible because they have a lot there. 

So I travelled by go train, all the way to the insurance /auction lot in Oshawa today. 


The experience I had was relentless & heartbreaking. 

Upon entering IAA, I asked to speak with the woman whom I spoke with earlier this morning, and she right away had a very unpleased look on her face about me coming to collect my property. 

She seen me and said "" our guys take pride in being throughout with cleaning & making sure everything is there."" 
""We just collect all garbage and throw it into bags and then the property is left in the vehicle."" 

So after she said this, she went to the back & grabbed a contractor garbage bag of stuff and handed it to me. 
Right away- I knew that not even half of my belongings were in the bag. But I took it and I said ""that's it?"" She proceeded to bat back at me and said ""that's all that was there , if there was anything else than it's been taking by the rental company."" 

I took a walk outside with the bag, opened it to see that not even a fraction of my belongings were there including very expensive shoes, brand clothing , electronics , jewellery , etc.

I returned back inside and I confronted her about it & her demeanour got worse. Almost offended. And she told me to wait and that she would be back. 
Insisted I sit down and wait as if 
I WAS IN TROUBLE..?
And she came back with a hi vis vest, handed it to me and told me to walk around the building as the truck was being brought for me to see.. (wasn't it already sold and picked up this morning?)
So I walked out to the back & went to the window to check who I was to speak to about the vehicle and lone behold, she's back there making a scene about something to the two yard men that I assume would be in charge of cleaning the truck & I witnessed her mid freak out. The one man opened the door and asked if I was there to see the truck and I agreed. I walked towards the truck and the two men followed me and asked me what I was missing and upon seeing the truck, 
There was still various things that belonged to me within the truck & no garbage had been thrown out or even cleaned. They actually took some of my stuff and threw it into the bed of the truck under the scrap auto parts from 
The accident and destroyed my belongings that were there , but all of my safety gear, all of my power tools, my hand tools, brand new car seat , amongst many more items - were not there or even recovered. 

I have video recordings of the whole thing as well as pictures
I told them I wanted to figure out who to speak to about this situation of my stuff being stolen & they offered me a coffee. In response I said no. I want my stuff. 
And they left. 


I returned to the front office and spoke about me getting my lawyer involved and she said to go after enterprise. 

And was very rude about it. 


Man , I'm starting to lose my mind a bit. 

I just need some help with who to call and what to do. 

If anyone could please help me out.

What should I get him? I already gifted him a gaming table but I want something to give him on Christmas morning.  (Table is mostly finished, I built it with the help of his friend) 
My husband is a huge D&D and fantasy board n video game fan. (Pathfinder,  Dark Souls, Shadow Run, Gurps, Elden Ring) In previous years I've gifted accessories,  new expansions, etc. This year unfortunately nothing new is out between his birthday and Christmas.  
The suggested lists on Google are laughable.

Or, maybe, the plan can wait. What's the worst that can happen?

Or every opinion you have is because you’re emotional/hormonal. I just got off the phone with my mom and told her she can’t plan a trip to take my 7y/o son across the country for vacation next year because I don’t know if I’ll be able to go at that time and she said “we can talk about it when you’re not pregnant and hormonal”..

1gjw62z,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1gjw62z/what_would_you_do_about_a_mean_sibling/,What would you do about a mean sibling?,"I've had my sister and her husband living with me in my house for the last two months. Our mum died unexpectedly and our dad told them to move out, but we'd been planning for them to come live with me eventually anyway. They are both very welcome here, I put together a periodic lease for them so it's official and they know I legally can't just throw them out - and I never would, but accusations are confessions, and she accused me many many times of not really wanting her around, to the point where I kinda don't anymore. If this were her house and I pissed her off, she'd probably kick me out or at least threaten it so she can have her way, I don't doubt that for a moment.

My sister is volatile. She always has been. The morning of their wedding she cracked the shits with hubby and went AWOL for an hour. We had relatives and friends visiting from all over and it was a shit show trying to cover for her when the groom wasn't even sure if the wedding was still going ahead and the guests are sitting around awkwardly waiting. It took us another hour or so to convince her to let us do her hair and makeup, she decided that she was going to go ahead with no hair and makeup and not even in her special wedding dress. Obviously she would have never forgiven us if we had let her go ahead with her stupid plan.

I'm not privy to the details of their relationship and I don't really want to know either, but I know my sister is a person you have to be really really careful around. She has a really aggressive attitude that she just doesn't seem to recognise or be aware of. She's developed a hobby of monologuing about all of the things that have gone wrong for her and how badly she was treated at school and work. We have had a few road trips together in the last couple of months and she will spend five hours straight talking about old wounds if you don't redirect her. 

She prefers to word things as passive aggressive sarcastic questions instead of helpful suggestions or reminders. Ie - instead of saying hey could you hang that decoration sideways so we don't have to duck, she would choose a harsh tone and say and what do you expect us to do when we walk under, just smack our heads? Do you think our guests would be comfortable and enjoying themselves with that in the way? She will continue till you verbally acknowledge that you are going to do it her way. She also chose to say this to me in front of all our relatives so I felt small and worthless. I once told her to pull over because she was driving like a dickhead, she was speeding and tailgating on the freeway, so she decided that she would hitchhike home and I had to grovel and beg for 40 minutes (and listen to her lecture me about MY dangerous driving that she had never mentioned before) before she'd get back in the car. I would probably have called her bluff and fucking left her there if we weren't in the middle of nowhere and leaving her would have been dangerous. 

So my sister is like, emotionally violent with everyone around her. I don't know how else to describe it. She doesn't fight fair, she'll always bring other stuff up, she'll go for the jugular. She once told me I deserved to be abused, because she was angry at me for not allowing her to harass a housemate I was having a conflict with. (Two seconds of thinking about it and you might realise starting shit with my housemate would just escalate all my problems at home) Just nasty shit like that. Like you think she's throwing a lifeline, but it's a snake and it'll bite when you grab hold. She knows I don't trust her and I try not to let on how I feel, but I can't hide that I resent her for all of the abuse she's dished out over the years. If she decided to cut me off forever I think my life would be much more peaceful and simple. I find myself wishing she would storm out and not come back. I'm just venting now, but if anyone has insight I'd love to hear your thoughts on this one -

We had some relatives visiting this weekend and she had two screaming matches with her husband in the morning while we were all hanging out. He's European so he will raise his voice when he's upset and she doesn't yell, just keeps repeating ""you don't love me"" and stuff, telling him his English is shit and he doesn't understand. We tried very hard not to listen and to continue our conversation in the next room. The relatives were pretty shocked. Sister comes into the sitting room where I am with the guests and tells me to evict him, they're getting a divorce. She then made several remarks about ending it all and locked herself in her bedroom while her husband simmered down outside. I was and still am concerned about these remarks, especially since we're all still grieving. 

But then she comes out of her room and it's like she's hit the reset button on everything. She's calm, cheerful, hanging out with the relatives, coming out for coffee with us, buying Christmas presents for her husband like she didn't tell me to evict him that morning. Her husband looks deflated and miserable, crying outside. He goes at her with the same attitude she brings to him, so naturally she escalates until the other person backs down. I don't believe it's typical for him to get aggressive the way she has done all our lives. He's shown me texts where she's threatening divorce and saying angry unkind things. Once she has her way, it's all water under the bridge to her, no matter what vile shit she's just said to her loved ones. If you get angry at her and carry it past the point that she's finished with the issue, you're the asshole in her eyes and she'll start up again. I have a good sibling relationship with my brother in law so I can tell he's beaten down and hurting, but I can't get involved or take a side and I don't want to. I can't imagine what she'd do to me if she thought I was siding with him against her.

What do you do when you're third wheeling a dysfunctional couple? People will probably just say ""just cut her off!"" And I daydream about that like other people would daydream about winning the lottery. If I'm going to go nuclear on her I might as well just kill myself because that will be faster, easier and probably have pretty much the same outcome.

I have embodied the Grey Rock. I don't have much going on at the moment anyway, so I don't need to share my opinions, my political views, I don't need to tell her if I'm dating, I bite my tongue 4 times out of 5 when it comes to anything personal or idealogical. I have my own inner bubble of safety and calm, and I can live just fine inside myself like that. She's gotten very frustrated with me for my grey rocking. I didn't tell her how I voted in a recent referendum because I knew she would have a go at me for it, so instead she had a go at me for not telling her how I voted. (I voted yes to the voice because I understand how the constitution works, would you believe it) I'm scared to water the pot plants because I did once a few days after she moved in and she came after me asking all kinds of sarcastic  questions in an angry tone. Yeah I'm not good at remembering to water the plants, I only kept a couple while I was getting the hang of it, but now I feel sick and sad when I look at my pot plants.

Well now I'm 32, she's almost 34, and I don't think this is a fair way for me to live my life anymore. I feel like I'm letting her walk all over me. I bought a place on my own and lived here just fine for a year but two months into this new arrangement and she ""does everything around this house"" and I'm back to feeling like a useless, helpless child in trouble, tiptoeing around the grown ups fighting bitterly.

Please ladies, give me your wisdom and your strength. This post has become such a mess. I need some tough love and constructive criticism, but if you just want to tell me this is my fault for letting her move in and I deserve this, spare it, you'd probably get along better with my sister. I pick my battles compromise where I can, but I'm not completely spineless.

Edit: I just talked to my BIL this morning, he told me she lied to him yesterday and said that she'd swallowed a bunch of pills to kill herself when she didn't swallow any pills at all. He lost a sibling to suicide so it's pretty deliberate on her part. She's an absolute monster when she wants to be.",2,1730773054.0,AskWomenOver30,4,0.75,False

Currently, I have an ""N/A Drink Menu"" alongside a ""Refills"" (priced at zero) menu. It's clumsy, but I guess it functions OK.  
Do I put modifiers on each menu beverage for ""1st Drink"" and ""Refill?"" With pricing at the modifier level to charge for 1st drink and 0 for refills?  
Auto discount doesn't work because if you have 4 soda drinkers at a table, you need to charge for 4, not 1.   
All beverages except coffee and water go to our bar station, FYI. So refills need to be rung in, but not charged.

David sat behind his desk, fingers drumming in rhythm to the ticking clock. He wasn’t a criminal in the traditional sense. No, he was worse—he stole dreams by denying loans, crushing aspirations with numbers. Today's target:

Olivia, the savings nerd, a master of budgeting, a queen of frugality. She had saved every penny, every dime, and he'd ruin her dreams.

His thoughts raced. She'd be in soon, armed with her spreadsheets and cup of coffee. He'd dealt with her before. She was coming back to prover her case. But she didn’t know who she was up against.

He had his own strategies. He could ruin her dreams with a simple tap of a few clicks. Why was it so satisfying to watch savings nerds struggle?

It was the power. The control. The ability to crush someone’s spirit.

He glanced at the clock. Time was ticking. Olivia walked in full of determination. She greeted him with a smile, unaware of the storm brewing in his mind. She started explaining her plans, her savings, her dreams.

He listened, nodding, but inside he was calculating. How could he make this hurt most? Her words faded into background noise. Numbers danced in his head. Interest rates, repayment plans, all the ways he could deny her.

But as she spoke, something shifted. Her passion ignited a flicker of doubt in him. Could he do this? Could he really crush her dreams? The thought clawed at him. He didn’t want to admit it, but there was something admirable about her. She fought against the odds, and for a moment, he felt a strange empathy.

He rubbed his head, feeling stupid. ""No, I can't do this for you because ....

And with that Olivia whipped out her can of Black Fire hairspray and sprayed it all over the room, lighting a match on her heel and flicking it in David's cubicle as she walked out of the bank.
