1oir209,https://www.reddit.com/r/daddyissuesclub/comments/1oir209/was_my_date_a_narcissist_or_did_i_self_sabotage/,Was my date a Narcissist or did I self sabotage?,"Hey Reddit, I really need some perspective because my head is all over the place.

I (F21) met this guy (M25) at a coffee shop. I was playing chess with a friend and he came up to me and asked if he could play. I said yes, and after that, I saw him again a few times. When we played the second time and I was leaving, I said “See you later,” and he said, “See you later hopefully.” It was small, but it stuck with me and after seeing him a few more times, I developed a crush.

Then I didn’t see him for over a month. My friends all said he looked like an F-boy, but I still liked him.

Out of nowhere, I bumped into him again at the gym. He seemed genuinely happy to see me and asked if I wanted to play chess later that day. I said not today. We chatted a bit more, I found out he boxes, and when I mentioned I did too, he said we should box together one day and took my socials. Later that day, I went swimming and saw him again by the pool. We talked more, and he asked me out. I said I was free the next day, but he never messaged me to confirm, so we didn’t go out.

I saw him again at the gym a few days later and was a bit cold with him because he’d flaked. On Friday I ran into him again I was tipsy before the gym, so I was extra confident and probably made it obvious I liked him. That same night, he messaged me and asked me out for coffee again.

We set a date for Tuesday. Over the weekend and Monday, we messaged a lot and he came across kind, respectful, and surprisingly not like an F-boy, he would also almost instantly reply to my messages,and ask a lot of questions about me . He even asked for my uni timetable so he could see when I had lessons, and he paid attention to it. He also questioned me a bit about a guy friend from the coffee shop, which honestly felt like a little bit of jealousy.

He’s currently on a driving ban but has a nice car. He told me if I wasn’t comfortable with him driving, I could drive it. I didn’t believe he was serious until the day of the date, he actually insured me on the car and let me drive. I’d never driven automatic before and was nervous, but he stayed calm and reassuring even though I wasn’t driving well at all. He even told me I could drive the car back, once the date was over, which I said no to.

We went for coffee, played chess again, and then the conversation got deeper. He asked about my past, I asked about his. That’s when he told me: •	“I’m a narcissist, so it’s better you know now.” •	His last girlfriend broke up with him. •	He doesn’t get attached easily •     He also told me he’s not manipulative,      just persuasive.

He also told me stories about getting into fights in the past and even being arrested twice but denied involvement, so nothing came of it legally. He followed it up by saying he’s “a calm person now” and has grown out of that phase.

I told him that if he ever disrespected me, I wouldn’t argue or stick around I’d just leave. I also told him (because he’s moving abroad in 2 months) that I’m not looking for a fling. He said that’s fine and he just wants to see where things go.

But here’s where I messed up. I couldn’t stop hearing what other people had said about him, calling him a fuckboy, and I’ve been hurt in the past so as soon as I heard the word narcissist my guard went up. Every time he said something, I’d give him a look, and he actually said: “Why are you looking at me like you’re interrogating me?” I told him straight up that my friends don’t like him, that he looks like a fuckboy, and I even said I think he has no emotions. When he asked if I really thought that, I said yes. When he told me he can be narcissistic, I said “I knew it, there was a vibe about you.”

Looking back, I was really rude. He, on the other hand, was nothing but kind. He didn’t get annoyed with my bad driving of HIS CAR. He wrapped up my food so I could take it home. He told me I smelled nice. He paid for everything. He showed me around the mall because he was surprised I had never been there before. He even insisted on dropping me off home, because it was far instead of the train station, but respected my boundaries when I said no, although he was very insistent that he could drop me off to my town without me having to share my address if I wasn’t comfortable. He also hugged me twice at the end of the date, once in the car, and once when I stepped out and he got out the car as well.

The only thing that stung a little was that he didn’t compliment how I looked I’d actually put effort in, since every other time he’d seen me I’d been dressed casually. But other than that… he was genuinely sweet.

Now I can’t stop overthinking and asking myself: Did I self-sabotage my date because of my insecurities and my friends’ opinions? I put up walls the whole time. And now that it’s over, I can’t stop thinking about how kind he actually was. Was it all just part of his plan, or was he a genuine guy?",1,1761699523.0,daddyissuesclub,0,1.0,False

1oiqtfj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIndianMen/comments/1oiqtfj/the_downfall_of_indian_women_good/,The Downfall of Indian Women Good ?,"Good Evening Gentlemen,
I come before you today not as a critic, but as a humble observer of the tragic decline of Indian Women — a sight that pains my noble heart deeply.

I was raised in a cultured household, where my mother taught me that women were the epitome of grace, dignity, and modesty. She used to tell me, “Son, a true lady never forgets her dupatta, or her decency.” Those words echo in my ears every time I see a woman on Instagram posting pictures with filters and… confidence.

I come from a long line of honorable men — we always stood up when a lady entered the room, even if it was just to check the Wi-Fi signal. But what do I see now? Influencers, hashtags, and cold brew coffee. Where is the humility? Where is the poetry?

During my college days in one of India’s most prestigious universities, I saw the horrors firsthand. Women laughing loudly in canteens, having opinions, wearing ripped jeans… it wasn’t the cultured environment I had imagined. Sometimes I sat in silence, clutching my ethics, feeling like the last gentleman left on this campus.

I have a younger brother — and it terrifies me that he’ll grow up in a world where women no longer wish to be saved. They walk alone at night, not even waiting for us to accompany them. How can we protect them if they don’t let us?

I try bringing these topics up with my female friends, but they resist. “We don’t need saving,” they say. But it’s not about them — it’s about our ethos as men.

I must also extend my gratitude to the few romantic partners who have taught me patience — even though they left me on read, they helped me grow into a better man.

Is there any hope for the women of this land? Will they ever return to the virtues of simplicity, or are we destined to scroll endlessly through stories of brunches, reels, and sarcasm?

I look forward to hearing your thoughts, dear men of Reddit. Together, perhaps we can restore the balance — one lecture at a time.

We’d go to his friend’s house parties together. I’d invite my friends (mostly guys due to the industry I work in RIP) over to our place for a dinner party and he’d bring a couple of his mates along. I will tell him about work banter with my male colleagues and he’d laugh along (they know him too and have invited him to outside-of-work events). When him and most of his female friends hang out they’d invite me (which I’d politely decline and let them enjoy themselves!), and I’m totally fine with them going out for brunch or coffee or drinks or whatever together because although I’m not as close to them I’m also a friend and like most of them! 

Essentially our social lives mesh well, our friend groups often come together. All gucci. 

At the same time, there’s this one female friend of his from back-in-the-days who I get very worked up about (AIO moment lol). They’re quite close since she’s one of his oldest friends from uni but every time she comes up I just want to roll my eyes. A few reasons…

I’ve met her 2 times, both times at a group gathering. I get that maybe she’s shy or whatever but she never talks to anyone else but her plus one or my bf. The time she does talk is when she’s piss drunk claiming that she’ll be the “best man” to my bf if we got married (lol didn’t ask but ok bro). So I don’t really know her apart from her social media (influencer type). 

My bf talked about her and her family a lot. I raised this to him because it was really pissing me off and since he’s been way quieter, but before I voiced this he wouldn’t stop yapping about how like him she also had a certain breed of dog growing up, her family’s business, what her sister does, her (ex)bf, and her influencing side hustle. I understand that they’ve known each other for a long time but remind me who is this person??? At one point he would say things like “I thought you knew xyz thing about her”- I’ve met this person twice and you bring her up so often?? Anyway it’s stopped since I brought it up and he apologised for not realising that he sometimes repeats himself a lot. Interestingly though I saw my bf text her and said “yeah my gf got annoyed because of this lol”. 

She either ghosts his texts, or calls him when she’s drunk/tipsy. He’s a very kind soul to his friends and is a very good texter, but she starts a convo, he replies, and doesn’t hear back for days. There’s also been a few times in the late evenings when e.g. we’re we out on a walk or chilling at home together and his phone gets rung up by her, and she’s calling him after a few drinks to complain about working late, or about her relationship, or just rambling in about whatever it is. To me this is just disrespectful of other people’s time, mental energy, and their own relationships? Or maybe she’s just intoxicated idk?

When she broke up with her bf, she called my bf. We were on the way home from an engagement party at 2am and she wouldn’t stop calling him. The next day when I woke up at 9am my bf’s already been on the phone with her for 2 hours. Then a few days later she called and asked him if she could stay over at our place for a couple weeks to sort herself out, even though her family lives very close by and I barely know her at all. He turned her down on the phone because I got annoyed (for context we have a guest room and would happily host friends and fam visiting from abroad). 

She stands people up. She would propose a catch up with my bf, and he would have to check whether it’s still happening or not and almost arrange everything. The romantics would call this spontaneous; I’m leaning towards inconsiderate. I said to him “well if she wants to hang out, why are you doing most of the work?” And he wouldn’t have a real answer. 

Idk at this point I just feel like she only takes but doesn’t give, and is extremely disrespectful of other people’s time and boundaries. She knows he has a gf me, and still calls at unsociable hours when drunk, ask for unreasonable favours, invites him out to drinks. I really don’t like her?? AIO? And what do I say to him?? Every time I hear about her I just get pissed off lol and I don’t know how to get over this. 

TL;DR bf’s one female friend gives massive pick-me energy. Drunkenly calls him at weird hours, tried to crash at our place for weeks after her breakup, ignores his texts but expects immediate support, barely acknowledges my existence when we meet, and my bf used to constantly talk about her until I complained).

1oiqpar,https://i.redd.it/lzca74i56yxf1.jpeg,Cottage Cheese Protein Pancakes : fluffy breakfast for small appetites,"Some mornings on GLP-1, breakfast feels like a chore. The appetite’s gone, everything sounds too heavy, and even coffee doesn’t hit right. These little cottage cheese protein pancakes have been my quiet fix for that.

They’re super soft, fluffy, and easy to eat, kind of like if a crepe and a cloud had a baby. I make a small batch (about six mini pancakes), which is just enough to get some protein in without that overfull, queasy feeling.

**What I use:**

* ½ cup cottage cheese
* 2 eggs
* ¼ cup oats or oat flour
* ½ teaspoon baking powder
* Pinch of cinnamon
* ½ teaspoon vanilla
* Tiny pinch of salt

Blend it all for 20 seconds so it turns smooth and airy. Cook them on low heat till golden on both sides. I usually top mine with a spoonful of yogurt or a few soft berries.

They sit really gently, perfect for shot weekends or slow mornings when you still want to eat *something* but don’t want to push it. The cottage cheese adds protein without making it dense, and the texture stays light enough to handle even if your stomach’s sensitive.

**Why they work:**

* Soft and light , no heavy batter feel
* Good protein without overwhelming your stomach
* Easy to portion,  you can stop after 2 or 3 and it still feels enough
* Warm, comforting, not too sweet

If you want a little twist, add blueberries for hydration and sweetness, or half a banana in the blend for that extra comfort-food vibe. You can even skip the vanilla and go savory with herbs and a bit of cottage cheese on top.

These have been a lifesaver for me on those “nothing sounds good” mornings. Curious what everyone else makes when their appetite disappears, what’s your gentle go-to breakfast lately?",3,1761698552.0,Glp1meals,2,1.0,False

-Book Loft to buy some new bday books
-Toy store, she hasn’t been able to tell us what she wants for her bday, so we thought it would be more fun to just let her pic a toy out on the day (is the Olentangy Target near the only option or is there anything closer to the “city”?)
-Fun lunch spot (she likes almost anything)

I am surrounded by trash my dresser is covered with empty drinks and plates. My floor next to my bed has 5 DoorDash bags. I have 2 rotting coffees on my head board. My stove is covered in trash. I havent taken my trash out in weeks so I had to put 5 bags of trash in my balcony closet. 

6 weeks ago my apartment was deep cleaned by me but the motivation was someone coming over. I know I will feel 10x better if it is clean but I just cant do it.

Also my tub is filled with water and I cant call maintenance because it's so gross I keep showering in it and letting the tap clump up in the water. The lightbulbs are out in my room so ive been in the dark for weeks. I bought lightbulbs because its too messy for maintenance to come in but it was the wrong ones so I gave up.

I really want a therapist but I dont show up to the appointments. I had an online physiatrist appointment but I missed it due to my sleep schedule being so random and they will not answer me to reschedule. 

I am planning on moving downtown when my lease is up in January I think it will help me a lot with being more social and leaving my apartment more (I am self employed) but I really want to use the next few months to build new and better habits because I view this move as a reset and I dont want to bring these issues with me.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

I don't know if I should keep fighting for this or let it go.","We’ve only been married for about 5 months, and honestly, I feel like I’m the only one trying anymore.

I cook, clean, work two jobs, try to make her life easier in every way I can. I wake her up for work, make her breakfast and coffee, handle the house, everything. I do it because I love her, not because I have to. But lately, it just feels like none of it matters.

We had agreed to spend a day together, she was too tired and slept the whole day. The next week, same plan, but she told me that day she already had plans with her friends and was sleeping over.
A couple of times I waited for her to come home so we could have dinner (which I cooked), and I found out later she was already out eating with her friends.

I finally texted her explaining how that hurts me, that I just want some connection, that I feel invisible, that I’m tired of always giving and not feeling wanted in return.

When we talked after that, it blew up. She flipped it on me, said I’m giving her a hard time for spending time with her friends, told me I “don’t love her,” and that I “make her feel like her mom used to.”
She even said she regrets marrying me. That crushed me.

I tried explaining that I’m not trying to control her, I just want us to feel close. She said I only do things because I expect something in return, that it’s the man’s job to initiate, and that her version of “partnership” is just not giving me a hard time.

We barely have sex anymore, and when we try, I sometimes lose my erection because I feel disconnected and anxious. I told her it’s not about her looks, it’s about how distant we are emotionally. She threw that back at me too.

Last night she slept on the couch and told me, “You said I don’t give you anything, so why does it matter if we sleep together?”

I’m just broken. I love her so much, but she makes me feel like I’m nothing to her. I’ve done everything I can to make her life easier and show her love, but she doesn’t see it, and instead tells me I’m like the mother she hates.

I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t want to give up, but I’m so unhappy and drained. Is there even a way to fix this? Or am I just holding on to something that’s already over?",3,1761698373.0,Marriage,2,1.0,False

If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

I need a recommendation on a machine!,"I like dark roast coffee specifically French roast. We currently have a Gaggia Brera that is struggling because of the oily beans. I’m too lazy to deal with constantly cleaning the brew group and grinder because of the oily beans. 

I love the single serve fresh ground beans but I think I’m going to have to give something up because of my laziness. I would like a recommendation on a good machine that I can use whole beans but not have to deal with the brew group and weekly grinder maintenance. I’m ok to give up the single serve aspect as long as I can at least limit the waste of coffee. I typically have 1 maybe 2 cups in the morning and my wife has 1 cup.

I don't know if I should keep fighting for this or let it go.","We’ve only been married for about 5 months, and honestly, I feel like I’m the only one trying anymore.

I cook, clean, work two jobs, try to make her life easier in every way I can. I wake her up for work, make her breakfast and coffee, handle the house, everything. I do it because I love her, not because I have to. But lately, it just feels like none of it matters.

We had agreed to spend a day together, she was too tired and slept the whole day. The next week, same plan, but she told me that day she already had plans with her friends and was sleeping over.
A couple of times I waited for her to come home so we could have dinner (which I cooked), and I found out later she was already out eating with her friends.

I finally texted her explaining how that hurts me, that I just want some connection, that I feel invisible, that I’m tired of always giving and not feeling wanted in return.

When we talked after that, it blew up. She flipped it on me, said I’m giving her a hard time for spending time with her friends, told me I “don’t love her,” and that I “make her feel like her mom used to.”
She even said she regrets marrying me. That crushed me.

I tried explaining that I’m not trying to control her, I just want us to feel close. She said I only do things because I expect something in return, that it’s the man’s job to initiate, and that her version of “partnership” is just not giving me a hard time.

We barely have sex anymore, and when we try, I sometimes lose my erection because I feel disconnected and anxious. I told her it’s not about her looks, it’s about how distant we are emotionally. She threw that back at me too.

Last night she slept on the couch and told me, “You said I don’t give you anything, so why does it matter if we sleep together?”

I’m just broken. I love her so much, but she makes me feel like I’m nothing to her. I’ve done everything I can to make her life easier and show her love, but she doesn’t see it, and instead tells me I’m like the mother she hates.

Firstly I arrived at this university knowing just 1 person. A close friend of mine that happened to know her because they live close by. 1 month passed I would look at her, she would look at me but we never really interacted. One day we had a physics lab we sat next to each other and I decided to talk to her. We did our in-class work and had a assignment for next week. Unexpectedly she waited for me and wanted to meet me. We took a walk around campus for around an hour. Exchanged socials, i didn't think much since I wasn't really feeling anything about her. First week goes by we talk a little from dms she approached me and we started having small talks here and there or as we waited for public transport we would talk for a bit. Now second week comes by we had a common break from 10 till 12 I got a message she wanted to hang out. Again it was mostly about university and all that but slowly slowly we started learning eachother more and more. 



Another week goes by we continued to talk from Instagram but her response times would range from 2 minutes up until 30 hours. I mirrored her behavior to he fair since I didn't care at the time and then she started double texting to get my attention. Tuesday comes by and we have that common break (its the only time of the week we both have a common break). She Again reached out and wanted to hang out at a nearby coffee shop. This time it was different she Firstly showed me her presentation, then vented about different topics about her putting for class representative. She sat next to me leaned onto me and started talking about her problems and bullying she has been facing in class after a good 2 hours of talking and sharing opinions and seeing how much chemistry we had. I started actually taking a liking on this girl.



During that week I helped her socialize and speak to people in our lectures she never spoke to before. I also spread her opinions around class and managed to gather around 35 people to vote for her. Anyways she did end up losing but texted me the same day ""just know im greatful for everything you did ❤️❤️"".
After that her response times where immediate and would find every chance to be close to me.



Currently its exam week. She is stressed, im stressed everyone is. Her response times are 30-40 hours but sends me tik toks all day. Basically she finds chances to talk to me. Always smiles at me, stares at me when im not looking and her body language is open and different around me and gets closer to me than your average friend. She sends me big voice mails 10-15 minutes. Appreciates me because I understand her and vented how she was never really treated this way, having someone that isn't bored of her talking all day. She does have bad rumors going around in my class and that kind of hurts her.



Now what's the negatives you might ask. 2 days ago she started talking about a blue eyed boy that looks at her and she thinks she mightve took an interest. Then hit me with the ""Im here trying to do love but at the same time I don't want to do love."". Now I did try to hit her with the ""yeah I like a girl too"" card but she seemed a little unhinged about it. Didn't ask me any questions like who. She responded with ""I won't judge just tell me and ill see if I'll help.""



TLDR I believe she seems me as a bestie/ friend but does invest alot of energy and wants to hang out 1 on 1. At the same time she compliments me and has this behavior. Im confused on how to continue this and what is really going on. She seems intrested but has pretty on and off behavior.

1oiqfw6,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeepThisInMind/comments/1oiqfw6/how_long_do_coffee_makers_last/,How Long Do Coffee Makers Last?,"If you love coffee as much as many of us do, knowing how long your coffee maker should last is important before you consider a replacement. The lifespan depends on various factors including the type of coffee maker, how often you use it, your maintenance habits, and its build quality.

**Average Lifespan by Coffee Maker Type**

* **Drip Coffee Makers:** Generally last around 4 to 6 years with average use and proper care. Their simpler mechanics tend to make them more durable with less maintenance.
* **Espresso Machines:** These vary widely. Manual and semi-automatic espresso machines often last between 7 and 15 years. Fully automatic or super-automatic machines with complex electronics may have a shorter lifespan around 4 to 8 years.
* **Single-Serve Pod Machines:** Usually last between 3 and 5 years. These tend to have more wear due to their compact, mechanical pod-piercing designs and electronics.

**Key Factors That Influence Coffee Maker Longevity**

* **Frequency of Use:** Machines used multiple times daily will wear faster, but interestingly, machines left unused for long periods can suffer from mechanical and electronic deterioration as well.
* **Maintenance and Cleaning:** Proper descaling, cleaning of coffee oils, and replacing water filters greatly extend the durability of any coffee maker. Neglecting these can cause buildup, damage heating elements, and impair taste and performance.
* **Water Quality:** Hard water accelerates scale buildup inside the machine, damaging components. Using filtered or softened water can vastly improve lifespan.
* **Build Quality and Brand:** While higher-end models usually offer better materials and reliability, a mid-range machine cared for well can outlast a premium model that’s neglected.

**Signs It’s Time to Replace Your Coffee Maker**

Look out for these indicators:

* Inconsistent brewing temperature resulting in weak or burnt coffee.
* Leaks or pooling water around the machine.
* Persistent odd noises or grinding sounds.
* Noticeable change in coffee taste indicating internal damage or residue buildup.
* Frequent breakdowns or need for repairs that become costly.

for context: i recently moved to france so it's still takes a bit of effort to talk all the time in french but he's moroccan so he understands most of my arabic and english so it's really easy for us to communicate.

the next day he texted me to say that he had a really nice time and he'd like to see me next weekend i said okay and after a couple of days we talked again but that was that. 

and the next saturday rolls around and he texts me to see me so invite him to go out with me and my friends. we were at a bar first and then we went to a club next to us but the bouncer didn't let me in because my id was digital so my friends went in and me in him went to sit next to the water and talk. we ended up going back to his place and there we obviously hooked up but i asked him before we went if he was pursuing this in a physical way or something more he said it's too early to tell and i said okay because he has a point. 

but the thing is while we were at his place i felt like we really connected emotionally and i just don't know if im the only one who feels this way but i really don't think so. we talked about stuff about the future and kids and love and biggest fears and where we'd want to settle down when we're doing with our studies. i won't get into more details because this post is already long but it was just genuinely the most romantic evening i've ever spent with anyone ever and he at some point asked me to take a picture of us together and i took a video and everytime someone sees it they say you seem and act like youre already a couple.

the day after he was still very sweet to me and he suggested to make me coffee or something to eat i said it's okay and we spent the morning together till noon then i went home because my phone was dead. he didn't text me all day until i sent a text which he replied to with ""im sorry i should've checked up on you that you got home but i fell asleep and had some stuff to do"" i didn't mind it i understand that people get busy, but then he ended the conversation immediately with ""anyways, catch up later"". 

no text after that, it's been a couple days and we're off this week from uni so he can't be THAT busy. i just dont know what to do or if im reading too much into it and making it a bigger deal than it is but i genuinely feel like he did feel that too that night. ",1,1761697601.0,Advice,3,1.0,False

The Senate voted 52 to 48 to pass the resolution sponsored by Sens. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.) to terminate Trump’s 50 percent tariffs on Brazilian imports, such as coffee, oil and orange juice.

Republican Sens. Mitch McConnell (Ky.), Thom Tillis (N.C.), Susan Collins (Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) voted with Paul and 47 members of the Democratic caucus to pass the resolution.

Paul, speaking on the Senate floor, called the tariff a tax on U.S. consumers.

The Kentucky Republican argued that the Constitution requires that “taxes must originate in the House” of Representatives.

“Yet, these taxes are originating with the White House,” he said.

The passage of the measure is largely symbolic, as Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) is unlikely to bring it to the House floor for a vote, and Trump would veto it if it ever reached his desk.

Democrats were able to force a vote on the resolution because it is privileged under the Senate’s rules. ",59,1761697567.0,neoliberal,4,1.0,False

I've heard Griffith Park and the Huntington Library are great places to spend a day .. which would you recommend (or something else)? He's too young to really need ""kid activities"", but he does need some surfaces to crawl and climb for a bit.

Additionally, where would be a good location to stay the night? We need to be at LAX by 8am the morning after. 

I know my partner would love to get dinner in Koreatown, but that's less of a priority.

Before the baby, I would usually stay in walkable neighborhoods with a lot of bakeries, coffee shops and restaurants, but willing to compromise for convenience and less driving! ",4,1761697556.0,AskLosAngeles,6,1.0,False

Hello guys I'm a freshman in mechanical engineering (19M) so is she she(19F) is also in my classes and labs. 



Firstly I arrived at this university knowing just 1 person. A close friend of mine that happened to know her because they live close by. 1 month passed I would look at her, she would look at me but we never really interacted. One day we had a physics lab we sat next to each other and I decided to talk to her. We did our in-class work and had a assignment for next week. Unexpectedly she waited for me and wanted to meet me. We took a walk around campus for around an hour. Exchanged socials, i didn't think much since I wasn't really feeling anything about her. First week goes by we talk a little from dms she approached me and we started having small talks here and there or as we waited for public transport we would talk for a bit. Now second week comes by we had a common break from 10 till 12 I got a message she wanted to hang out. Again it was mostly about university and all that but slowly slowly we started learning eachother more and more. 



Another week goes by we continued to talk from Instagram but her response times would range from 2 minutes up until 30 hours. I mirrored her behavior to he fair since I didn't care at the time and then she started double texting to get my attention. Tuesday comes by and we have that common break (its the only time of the week we both have a common break). She Again reached out and wanted to hang out at a nearby coffee shop. This time it was different she Firstly showed me her presentation, then vented about different topics about her putting for class leader. She sat next to me leaned onto me and started talking about her problems and bullying she has been facing in class after a good 2 hours of talking and sharing opinions and seeing how much chemistry we had. I started actually taking a liking on this girl.



During that week I helped her socialize and speak to people in our lectures she never spoke to before. I also spread her opinions around class and managed to gather around 35 people for her. Anyways she did end up losing but texted me the same day ""just know im greatful for everything you did ❤️❤️"".
After that her response times where immediate and would find every chance to be close to me.



Currently its exam week. She is stressed, im stressed everyone is. Her response times are 30-40 hours but sends me tik toks all day. Basically she finds chances to talk to me. Always smiles at me, stares at me when im not looking and her body language is open and different around me and gets closer to me than your average friend. She sends me big voice mails 10-15 minutes. Appreciates me because I understand her and vented how she was never really treated this way, having someone that isn't bored of her talking all day. She does have bad rumors going around in my class and that kind of hurts her.



Now what's the negatives you might ask. 2 days ago she started talking about a blue eyed boy that looks at her and she thinks she mightve took an interest. Then hit me with the ""Im here trying to do love but at the same time I don't want to do love."". Now I did try to hit her with the ""yeah I like a girl too"" card but she seemed a little unhinged about it. Didn't ask me any questions like who. She responded with ""I won't judge just tell me and ill see if I'll help.""



TL;DR I believe she seems me as a bestie/ friend but does invest alot of energy and wants to hang out 1 on 1. At the same time she compliments me and has this behavior. Im confused on how to continue this and what is really going on. She seems intrested but has pretty on and off behavior. Does speak to me daily at university and we will talk for a lengthy amount of time in or out of class. On Instagram she will leave me on delivered for 1 or 2 days. But proceeds to send me tik toks and answer to mine back. Its been around 4 weeks since we started talking. What do yall think?",1,1761697350.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

1oiq8h6,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1oiq8h6/something_hatched_in_the_nickel/,Something hatched in the Nickel,"Hello. The past three days since that night have been a swirl of packing, making calls, talking to managers, moving out and in, and trying to barely think about what happened, but I’m going to post this as a little insurance. That’s if I can even type it all out—every creak of flooring and every door slammed in my building feels like death.

I’m going to change the names around, but someone very close will reveal this is real if my company tries anything. I don’t think they really would, but I’m on such an edge right now I couldn’t get the thought out of my head. So here I am.

My name’s Riley, and I work as a night watchman. I’ve been trying to make a music career work, but the money hasn’t exactly been flowing. My bass player Mule—his real name’s Stan, but he carries our heaviest equipment so we call him Mule—and I got the job together, and for the last five months, it’s been great.

We’d work shows from evening till night, then we’d go to work and make our rounds talking about the band. The worst thing that ever happened was just stuff like snakes or birds tripping alarms. All of this is to say I would have been content to keep the routine for years, until Wednesday night.

The company I work for is pretty big and owns a lot of blue-collar sites, and the one I was working at is a nickel refinery. We don’t have many of them in the US, but the one I worked at is a pretty busy one. Anyway, we were probably halfway through our shift. Mule was in the parking lot, and I was heading up onto a catwalk above a pile of raw nickel. We were playing this game where one of us hums a song and the other has to guess the band.

“Hm hm hm… hm-hm-hm hm hm hm”

“It’s Queen, ‘Another One Bites the Dust.’”

Mule would usually throw me the basics. It sounds like a boring game, sure, but when it’s dark and every gust of wind or fallen leaf makes you jump, it helps ease your nerves. I was passing along the catwalk, losing to Mule as he guessed a Soundgarden song, when I started absentmindedly kicking bits of nickel.

Filtered rocks piled out from a sieve a little ways off the walk, but bits would still fall onto it. They would scrape across the metal and make a dull sound below:

*S*c*r*e*ec*h

**Thud**

Mule was checking out a truck for a second, so I was all alone. In those moments between words, you really have to force off any nerves and just pretend like you’re in control. I came to another rock:

S*c*r*e*ec*h*

**Thud**

When I say pretend to be in control, I just mean you have to throw off the “technicallys.” Technically, someone could be sneaking up behind me, but technically, if I turn my back, whoever’s waiting ahead could take their shot. Another rock:

*S*c*r*e*ec*h

**Thud**

The best you can do is just keep forward, hold your nerves, watch, and hope. I heard a bang of metal somewhere far off, and I began to listen in close. There was a final rock:

S*c*r*e*ec*h*

**Th-crack**

Hissssssss

My attention snapped below. I tried to tell myself that it was a snake, but a snake couldn’t hiss loud enough to hear from a catwalk. Besides, this noise was different.

“Hey Mule, I heard something weird. I think there’s some animal in the facility, I’m gonna go check it out.”

“Okay, sounds good. That truck was fine, by the way, someone just forgot to roll their windows down. I swear, man—”

He rambled on, but even with Mule talking, the silence was thicker. Sounds like the rattling of the stairs was actually eerie again, but I was still able to pretend it was nothing important.

I wasn’t too sure after I saw a large chunk of nickel, split in half, oozing with a grey, pungent slime that led away.

I radioed in and explained to Mule.

“...Really?”

“Yeah, man, come down here and look at this shit.”

Despite my instincts, I threw a look over my shoulder.

“I don’t want to deal with this alone. I think I might go ahead and radio in to the others.”

Mule and I were only junior watchmen, so we just got a taser and outside watch. The senior watchmen actually had guns and were assigned to the file rooms.

“Well, you know the rules—we only radio if something’s wrong.”

“Seems like something's wrong to me!”

“*Sigh.* Yeah, I meant like if we actually see something. I mean… what’s to say it’s not just some hibernating reptile or something?”

“Bro, it came out of solid rock.”

“Listen, just wait there. I’m heading your way. You’re in the East wing, right?”

“Yeah, I’ll be waiting here.”

Three agonizing minutes passed by as I waited. Three minutes of jumping at birds flying off, staring and darkly theorizing at the slime, and barely breathing to keep quiet. I almost had a heart attack when I was struck by Mule’s flashlight for the first time.

“What took you so long?!”

“Calm down, man, it’s not—*Whoa.*”

Mule flashed his light over the rock. I saw the fear creep its way over his face, but then he fought against it.

“Look, Riley, this is definitely freaky, but it’s our job to deal with stuff on our own before calling for backup.”

I stood there locking eyes with him, shifting on the spot. He had a point, sure, but I wish I’d had the spine to tell him no. Probably wouldn’t have changed anything, but still, it would’ve been better.

“You remember what happened to Jane? She had one false alarm, and they put her off duty for a week!”

“Okay. Okay, fine.”

I scanned around. Whatever was leaking out of the nickel only went a few meters beyond it.

“The trail leads down that way, but there’s a fork south and north. I’ll take south, alright?”

Mule scanned around a bit, trying to seem in control, before answering.

“Okay, sounds good.”

I remember getting some of my confidence back after regrouping with Mule. It really began to be feasible in my mind that this was some rare animal we hadn’t heard of. We went on our separate paths, and the paranoia began to eat over me once more. My radio sparked up:

“Hmmmmm hm hm hmmmhmm hmm—”

“Look! Now’s not the fucking time.”

“Alright, man, calm down. We’ll get this over with first.”

“Good, and besides, that was ‘Wayward Son,’ and you made it obvious.”

I found nothing—just some high-dollar equipment that wasn’t locked up. After I set it in its place, I radioed in.

“Mule, I’m not finding anything on my end. It probably is some kind of lizard or something. I’ll keep looking, but—”

“Riley,” he was speaking in a shaky whisper, “I found something. It looks like some kind of husk.”

“...What does it look like?”

“It’s like—oh shit!… WAIT W-WA—AAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!”

The radio pierced my ear with static, but I didn’t bother to turn it off as I ran back the way I came, taser out. I found a break room trailer with the door open, but all was silent. I began to make my way over to the door, but suddenly a streak of shiny grey-black came hissing out of the darkness. I fired my taser the moment I saw it, without aiming first, and I put up my hands to brace. It hit me with more force than I expected from something so small, and I felt a wet, searing pain run over my arm. I dropped onto my back, and whatever it was ran off farther into the facility.

I was trying to catch my breath, but the pain in my arm was taking it away. I ran into the trailer and flipped the light on, but pain or not, the macabre and disgusting sight of Mule froze me for a moment. I ran over to the sink and ripped off my jacket and ran my arm under hot water.

Across my left forearm was a grey, shimmering slime, and though it was cold as ice, its acidity burned like hot steel. I only got hit with some residue off its body though, so I was able to wash it off. It hurt me to do so, but after I was done, I turned around.

There are many scenes from that night that will haunt me, but seeing Mule, laid out over the coffee table, eyes and mouth agape, in a petrified scream as the rest of his body was melting into shimmering goo and red slush, will hurt me for years to come. Even the band pins on his coat were melting—those were his favorite.

I went back outside and picked up the radio I’d dropped. I found it, too, had gotten a slash of acid, and was subsequently buzzing and chirping uselessly.

I had two options: hole up in the trailer and hope it didn’t come back, or make a break for the security office. My nerves were too shot to think clearly, but hours of loneliness with Mule’s disintegrating corpse was still a hard sell. Besides, I still had a job to do.

I started walking. Each breath and step felt like trying to soundlessly drag a bag of metal pans. At that point, it didn’t matter what the noise was; it made me jump and stand still all the same.

I wouldn’t say I’m not brave. I had respect from the other security workers, and I’ve handled myself well, but what are you supposed to do? Stay calm in the face of some unknown thing that’s as fast as a wasp and melts skin?

I began to pick up on a trail that, much to my nausea, was in the direction I was headed. Scenes like forklifts seared down to a third, discarded bits of flesh, and sickening pieces of molted grey skin began to pop up. I kept on, until I saw a reflective mound ahead.

One of the other watchmen, Ted, had been attacked. All that was left of him was bone, a few stray scraps of flesh, and his radio. I almost marveled at how fast this thing could pick someone apart while I clicked it on.

“Hello, this is Riley. Something’s loose in the facility, and I need help. I’m just outside the office, so meet me down here.”

No response. I set it on SOS and kept walking, but I soon heard a noise. It reminded me of a dog eating kibble, and when I rounded the corner, I saw it.

Most of it was just a dark grey silhouette, but I could make out many details. Somehow it had grown to be at least three meters. Its body was long and covered in shiny hairs that looked sharp as needles. Its arms—there had to be at least seven pairs—were busy probing over a pile of raw nickel. I watched it consume pounds and pounds of nickel as leftover flesh flicked off its sharp body. I was just standing there, peeking around an excavator, when my radio suddenly sounded.

“Hey, Rile—”

I snapped it off and ducked under the machine. The noise had ceased, and it became deathly quiet. Silent as it was, I could still hear it inching towards me. Under a half moon’s light, I could barely see the bottom of it over the long rubber wheels. Time had slowed down. Acid saliva dripping down seemed to take minutes, multiple legs piercing the soil beneath felt like hours, and then, when it was only a couple meters away, I began to hear its high-pitched hum.

“RILEY! WHERE YOU AT?”

“Tracker says he’s just over there.”

It sounded like my supervisor and some of the other senior watchmen. My heart sank when the thing flipped around and rushed towards them.

There was nothing I could do. I just sat there as my ears were barraged by the sounds of screams, a terrifying insectoid warble, and gunshots. When I heard the crunching of bone, I nearly began to cry.

The feeding was over quick, and I suppose it had forgotten about me because everything was silent before long. It still took some time to drag myself out though. Once more I was faced with a choice: stay there and wait to be hunted, or make for the security office where they lock our phones up for a shift. I chose the latter, and I suppose the guilt of my cowardice helped push me forward. I’ll spare you the details of the “leftovers,” but it’s enough to say the number of bodies only left me and some scattered junior watchmen.

I found the office undisturbed as I quickly bolted the door behind me. There’s a main tracking system that shows where each radio is in the facility. To my surprise, one of them—Leonard’s—was heading straight for the office. It then hurt me dearly to realize it was only me and him left. As the first light of day shone through the blinds, Leonard came smashing into the office door, and I think I almost gave him a heart attack when I unbolted it and popped out at him.

“AHHH!”

“It’s me, man, calm down!”

“R-RILEY! This fucking thing, it attacked me and Chris, and—”

“I KNOW, I KNOW! Just breathe and keep quiet, man!”

I pulled him in and locked up. We sat there unloading on each other.

“I can’t believe Mule’s dead, Riley.”

“I—I know.”

My thoughts turned to him. Rotting in that trailer, when we should be getting off to go sleep right now. I thought of our dreams, all our plans. Taken away. The only thing I could do for him now was to try and get this thing caught.

“Leonard, keep watch. I’m gonna go get my phone to call the cops.”

My hands were still shaking, so it took a few tries to get the combination lock off, but once I did, I dialed 911 faster than you can imagine. As I was beginning to explain things to a tired operator, Leonard’s face made me pause. He looked mortified.

I knelt down beside him and separated the blinds. There, at the end of the yard, we saw it. It was over twelve meters long and it was climbing over the fence, dragging a pair of legs with it. And, not far behind, something small followed. Something with shiny hairs and dozens of legs.

Once it was gone, the whole night and its implications finally dawned on me. These monstrous killers were loose, and I freed them. Someone else would have eventually, sure, but still. They could kill anyone in their way, guns apparently didn’t work on them, and they were breeding.

We kept our frozen position on that couch for hours until everyone arrived. After that, it all feels like one long sleepless dream. The company couldn’t have this out, so I guess some deals were made, because the next day the cops were reporting that a machine accident had taken out all the watchmen together in the office—all but me and Leonard.

I was in no state to perform, my best bandmate Mule was gone, and so my music career was certainly not high on my priorities. Besides, with all the stress and lack of sleep, I could barely think as they shoved papers and NDAs under my nose. I could lose my job, or I could take a serious pay raise on the other side of the country. I don’t know if it was the right decision, and I don’t know if going back on my word and posting this is either. But I still don’t want some suit deciding I’m not worth the risk and snuffing me out. Hopefully, this post protects against that.

I’m not sure where life is taking me now, but at least it’s away from that town, with those things. Maybe this all amounts to nothing but the death of a few good men—my good friends—but maybe those things are multiplying.

If they are, then be ready to hide.

And stay away from nickel refineries.

1oiq785,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oiq785,La Repuvlika de Kuba,"On March 31, 1492, three months after the fall of Granada, the Alhambra Decree was proclaimed by Queen Isabella of Castille. All practicing Jews under the Castillian-Aragonese monarchy would have to convert to Christianity or leave. These Jews, the Sephardim, fled Spain in droves, with some estimates placing the population of exiled Jews at 300,000. In our timeline, the Sephardim fled to North Africa, Italy, and the wider Ottoman Empire. 

In this timeline, King Ferdinand is able to convince Isabella not to give the decree so early after the Spanish Conquest of Granada, preferring to wait for a time so they could profit from the labor of Spain’s Jewish population and for the Reconquista to fully take hold in the South. But, less than a year after the decree was supposed to be proclaimed, Christopher Columbus returned from his Caribbean voyage, telling Ferdinand and Isabella of the faraway land. Queen Isabella leapt at her chance, proclaiming the Toledo Decree of 1493. The Sephardim would not be exiled from Spain, but would be used as a tool of colonization. She declared that to purify Spain, the Jews could either be exiled to the New World, North Africa, or convert to Christianity. If there had to be Jews in her empire, she wanted to ensure that they would be far away, out of sight and mind.

Isabella and Ferdinand declared the creation of a colony on the island of Cuba, called Nuevo Aragón (Muevo Aragón, מובה ארגון). To populate it, the Spanish monarchs commissioned a fleet of 50 ships to begin a large-scale population transfer of the Sephardic population from Spain to the Caribbean. The fleet completed one voyage per year for two decades, transporting 50,000 Sephardic Jews from Cádiz to Nueva Barcelona (Muevo Barcelona, מובה ברסלונה), Nueva Valencia (Mueva Valencia, מובה בלנסיה), and Nueva Palma (Mueva Palma, מובה פלמה) between the program’s start in 1495 and its end in 1515. 

From then on, Sephardic Jews became influential early explorers in the region, like Rafael Abenafia, who fully mapped the coasts of Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola, and the Lucayan Archipelago by 1510. They also played an important role in the early colonization of the Caribbean - the growing Sephardic settlements in Cuba and their accompanying farmland were among the early pressures which drove the Taíno to revolt against Spanish overlordship. But, the cruel and deadly policies put in place by the governors of the Spanish Caribbean during the 1500s quickly led to the near-extinction of the Taíno people. Throughout the early 1500s, more and more conversos, that is, Jews who had converted to Christianity, discretely made their way from Spain to Nuevo Aragón, rejecting their new religion in favor of that of their birth. This constant influx of population, paired with Spanish institutional backing, prevented the colony of Nuevo Aragón from collapsing in on itself during this time.

Just as the Sephardic settlements had been a key part of Spanish colonialism before 1550, those same settlements became the lifeblood of Taíno resistance in later decades. The Jewish population of the island had no personal loyalty to Spain, having themselves been exiled to the New World. So, when the Taíno began suffering similar persecution to that which the Jews had faced in Iberia, the leaders of the Sephardic settlements, headed by Rabbi Messod Danon, accepted Taíno refugees and hosted Taíno freedom fighters. Over time, Cuba and the settlements which made up Nuevo Aragón (Muevo Aragón) attracted the vast majority of the surviving Taíno from across the Caribbean, who fled slavery under direct Spanish rule.

Throughout the 1500s, a strong Taíno-Sephardic mixed culture began to emerge in Nuevo Aragón. Though nominally within the Spanish Empire, Spain worried very little about the governance of this island - so long as they were exporting sugar. To do so, the Spanish imported a large number of slaves to Nuevo Aragón from Africa to be overseen by the mixed local population. However, the anti-slavery Sephardic-Taíno population rejected the institution of slavery at its very core. Communal Sephardic labor had been used in the years leading up to slavery - it would be used again, now. The Sephardic population in particular held religiously-inspired ideas about slavery and exile harkening back to their own collective memory of that trauma, so when African slavery began to take off in the Caribbean in the early 1530s, the Sephardic-majority island of Cuba halted their sugar exports in protest. In time, people of the Taíno-Sephardic mixed culture came to be known as Kubanos.

Spain, in a fury, demanded that Nuevo Aragón export the waiting sugar, but the Nuevo Aragonians held firm. An overwhelming force was sent to the island in 1535, but the Taíno, Sephardic, and Black populations of the island knew it better than the Spanish forces, disappearing into the island’s dense interior. Try as they might, Spanish forces sent to recover the settlements and find the settlers were doomed to be unsuccessful. Between 1535 and 1565, Nuevo Aragón was only nominally part of the Spanish Empire, its population hostile to Spanish oversight. However, King Philip II was able to reassert control over Cuba in 1565 by granting amnesty to the island’s population and agreeing to prevent slavery from taking place on the island. The island resumed sugar exportation, but its place as only nominally Spanish was permanently cemented into the culture of the island during this era.

By the late 1500s, almost all of the Caribbean had fallen under European control, with ships from English, Dutch, French, Portuguese, and Spanish ports sailing around the New World. A coastal settlement in the North of the Island, named la Habana (לה הבנה), became centrally important on the island, gaining a large population of traders and wealthy merchants. The next century would see little change to the status quo, even as the English and French slowly stripped territory away from the Spanish. In 1602, the Sephardic settlers of Cuba declared la Región Judía Autónoma de Cuba (the Autonomous Jewish Region of Cuba), which isolated it from the Catholic-controlled islands and territories around it. Toledo did not recognize their autonomy for several years, eventually agreeing to quietly look the other way and ignore the island’s Judaism in exchange for higher taxes. One consequence of Nuevo Aragón’s Jewish rather than Catholic colonization was the preservation of Taíno religion. Judaism does not encourage conversion or proselytisation, so the Taíno people did not have Christianity pushed on them in the same way as in our timeline. Some Taíno living in Nuevo Aragón, especially those originally from Puerto Rico and Hispaniola, had been converted by the Spanish, but most Taíno in Nuevo Aragón retained their indigenous religion. 

The 1600s were a comparatively dynamic century for the Caribbean, as the slow decline of the Spanish Empire drew it into conflicts with France, England, and the Dutch. Nuevo Aragón remained mostly out of the fray, but lost its Northernmost and Southernmost territories (Bahamas and Turks and Caicos and Jamaica and the Cayman Islands) to the British in the latter half of the century. Those distant territories were mostly populated by Catholic Spaniards, though, so what remained of Nuevo Aragón was even more distinct and separate from Spain itself. England expelled the residents of these islands to Puerto Rico rather than to Nuevo Aragón, as in our timeline. Also during this time, the Taíno were generally assimilated into the Sephardic population. Disease from the European settlers as well as the destruction of their traditional ways of living prevented the wounded Taíno nation from healing fully after colonization began, and by the end of the 1600s, most Taíno spoke Ladino and many had even converted to Judaism, thus completing the creation of the modern Kubano identity.

In the 1700s, Enlightenment philosophy began to permeate European society, making its way even as far as Nuevo Aragón. The Ladino speaking, Jewish-majority, largely self-sufficient island of Cuba began eying increased autonomy, especially after the American and New Granadan revolutions of the later decades of the century. In 1735, the island was carved out of the Captaincy of Florida and consolidated into the Captaincy of Nuevo Aragón, to be ruled by a local hand-selected by the King of Spain. In 1742, Nuevo Aragón was permitted to raise a domestic military force for protection against other powers. In 1758, the Captaincy was granted sole responsibility and control over the port of la Habana in the North of the island. 

In 1794, the French invaded Spain, sparking a series of revolutions across the New World as the colonies came to the collective realization that they did not need Spain to manage their affairs for them. Nuevo Aragón was no different, its people declaring their independence from Spain on April 9th of that year as the Republic of Kuba (La Repuvlika de Kuba, לה רפובליקה ד קובה). The Spanish were unable to resist the immediate and violent decolonization of the Caribbean and South America, beginning with their loss of Nuevo Aragón in 1795 in the Treaty of La Habana and ending with their loss of all of their American territories by 1820. 

During the 1800s, Kuba grew as a primarily-agricultural economy, focusing on coffee, sugar, and tobacco. The city of La Habana (לה הבנה) grew especially quickly, its port becoming a major thoroughfare for ships entering and exiting the Gulf of Mexico. Geopolitically, Kuba was dominated by larger and more powerful neighbors, so it tried to avoid conflict. Towards the middle of the century, Kuba faced an invasion by Americans, led by Southerners trying to establish a so-called “Golden Circle.” The Kubans quickly defeated the American force, who returned in the 1890s to try to take the island again. Kuba briefly fell under American control between 1897 and 1906, and remained only nominally independent until the repeal of the Platt Amendment in 1934, when Kuba reestablished full sovereignty over itself. 

Kuba remained neutral in both World Wars, but accepted thousands of Jewish refugees from Europe in the lead-up to and aftermath of the Holocaust, making it the country with the highest Jewish population in the world by 1950 with \~7 million Jews, including \~0.5 million Ashkenazim and 6.5 million Sephardim making their home there. The 1950s and 60s saw Kuba turn towards the West, agreeing to host the American Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay in exchange for trade exclusivity for Kuba with regards to certain products, like sugar, rice, and coffee. 

Modern-day Kuba is a major tourist destination in the Caribbean, attracting visitors from around the world to witness the country’s unique cultural and historical heritage. Since the end of the Cold War, the island nation has prospered and remains the premier naval power in the Caribbean. Ties with the United States have weakened over the years, but there nominally remains in place a strong alliance between the nations.",8,1761697191.0,AlternateHistory,0,1.0,False

How do I get him to understand?,"We've been on and off again for a few years mostly due to life circumstances. Nothing dramatic or relationship related. But now for about a year we are much more what people consider ""serious"" and it's been great! We get along great and he's very supportive of my career, solo travel, hobbies, friendships, etc.

He really wants to live together and I swear in my head I hear a record scratch every time he mentions it. He's never lived by himself and in the couple years I've known him, he's lived with other guys in a total pig sty or with his extremely wealthy family and a maid. He's not great at picking up after himself, his standards of cleanliness are low, and when he does clean up after himself it sometimes results in a disaster. For example he will use a whole roll of paper towels to wipe something down when a rag, sponge, or scrub brush would have done a better job and then proceed to try and flush the whole thing down the toilet. Now I have no paper towels and have to go use the bathroom in the coffee shop because the toilet is broken.

I told him I would be interested in spending lots of time at his place to see how he handles living on his own. Then maybe one day we could talk about living together.

When he gets frustrated at my fears over turning into his maid because I'll want the place reasonably clean and not destroyed, he offers to get a cleaner. While this is a nice offer it bugs me for a few reasons. We live in a city with small apartments unless you're super rich so I just never found it that hard to clean my own place while working full-time plus I like the privacy. He will be working part-time in a 700 sf apartment so I think he should just clean it. The offer of hiring a cleaner really makes me so unnattracted to him. It makes me see him as a lazy, spoiled, rich child. I wish he would see for me it's about developing a send of responsibility, self sufficiency, and pride in keeping your small living space clean. I don't know how to tell him this without hurting his feelings. 

I don't think I'm asking for much. Just watch a few YouTube videos on scrubbing a tub, making a bed, washing the bed sheets, it's all online now! Please help. I feel so frustrated and sad. In every other way he's a mature and supportive partner but I think he doesn't know how to live without a maid and I'm scared of becoming the maid!",48,1761697188.0,relationship_advice,42,0.91,False

1oiq5z4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1oiq5z4/sunday_with_leah/,Sunday with Leah,"It was one of those gray, quiet Sundays that seemed to exist outside of time. The kind where the sky never quite brightens and the whole world feels muted, as if it’s agreed to let you rest for a while.

You woke first. The house was still, except for the faint sound of wind moving against the old windowpanes. Leah was asleep beside you, one hand tucked under her cheek, her hair an easy tangle across the pillow. You watched her for a moment before she stirred, squinting at you with that soft, lazy grin she always had in the morning.

“Coffee?” she murmured.

“Always,” you said.

Downstairs, the fire in the wood stove had burned down to embers, so you stirred it back to life. Lucy followed, stretching and shaking her collar until the tags jingled. The house smelled faintly of cedar and last night’s candles. You ground the coffee, poured the water, and waited for that first rich scent to fill the kitchen.

Leah came down wrapped in your old sweatshirt, the sleeves nearly swallowing her hands. Her hair was piled up haphazardly, and she still had the faint pillow crease on her cheek. She leaned against the counter, bleary-eyed and perfect.

“What’s for breakfast, chef?” she asked.

“French toast,” you said. “With that thick bread from the bakery.”

That bakery was your Saturday ritual. The old man behind the counter always tucked an extra pastry into Leah’s bag and winked at you. “She’s a keeper,” he’d say every time, and Leah would grin and blow him a kiss that made him blush like it was the first time anyone had ever done it.

You whisked the eggs and cinnamon while the coffee brewed. The record player in the living room was already spinning — something you’d dropped the needle on before she came down. The familiar crackle of vinyl drifted through the house, mingling with the smell of maple syrup and toasting bread.

Leah danced a little as she passed through the doorway, her bare feet silent on the floor. “We should move the turntable in here,” she said, leaning around the doorframe.

“Absolutely not,” you said. “Good music deserves good acoustics.”

She laughed and disappeared into the living room for a minute, and you heard her humming along to the record, her voice just barely carrying over the soft guitar and hiss of the fire.

Breakfast lingered long after it was done. The two of you sat at the kitchen table with mugs of coffee and sticky plates, talking about nothing — about Lucy’s new habit of stealing on Leah’s socks, about the news, about how you should really get out and walk before the day faded away.

Eventually, you bundled up and did just that. The air outside had that crisp, damp edge that hinted spring was trying to find its way in. The woods behind the house were quiet, except for the occasional crow and the soft crush of leaves beneath your boots. Lucy bounded ahead, nose to the ground, tail wagging.

Leah looped her arm through yours. “I could live in this moment forever,” she said.

You squeezed her hand. “You kind of already do.”

By the time you got home, your cheeks were pink and your fingers cold. Leah kicked off her boots by the door and announced, “Soup. Definitely soup.”

In the kitchen, you chopped vegetables while she stirred. The turntable spun again in the living room — a Bonobo record this time, all low beats and warmth. The music drifted in and out, mixing with the sound of the knife on the cutting board and the occasional clink of the wooden spoon against the pot. Lucy curled up by the stove, her fur drying in the rising heat.

Leah reached across to steal a carrot slice and grinned. “You realize we’re basically a cliché, right?”

“Perfectly fine with that,” you said.

When the soup was done, you ate on the couch, bowls warm in your hands, the music still playing softly. Outside, the light was fading fast. The fire crackled again, throwing shadows across the room.

Leah set her bowl down and leaned against you, sighing contentedly. “We did nothing today,” she said.

You smiled, kissed her temple, and murmured, “Exactly how it should be.”

The record kept turning, slow and steady, as the house settled into the quiet rhythm of the night — fire, music, soup, and the easy warmth of being together.",1,1761697097.0,stories,0,1.0,False

Just how do I approach this new hobby!? 

Obviously, my grains are different than the tutorial showed, and mine came out of the freezer, so the time markers were off right from the beginning, and first crack did start around the 7 mins mark, but seemed to go on and on and on like popcorn, so I started the cooldown at 8:15.

The freshly roasted grains(Mason Jar) does look similar to what I usually drink(Airscape), which I’d consider medium roast I guess(?), but I’ll wait 2 days before trying it in my Lelit Mara X.

Now I don’t have the roaster’s companion book, so I have no clue what to do now, but have a ton of questions..

- How do I gauge the different phases of my roasting, as I’m in it? 
- How do I discern first and second crack, especially if it doesn’t seem to stop?
- Is it fine to roast fresh beans straight out of the freezer?
- I’ve read here that a loosely closed mason jar is fine to let the roasted beans breathe for a day or two, is this true?
-Do I start every beans on the same basis, or are there largely different roastings, for each type of processed beans?
- How do I learn from now on, is it imperative to note absolutely everything down?

I have so many questions I could keep going on , but those come to find first…

If anyone has a reference that pretty much answers it all, I’d be grateful!

1oiq47b,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossJourneyUSA/comments/1oiq47b/beyond_the_scale_your_top_5_questions_for/,Beyond the Scale: Your Top 5 Questions for Sustainable Weight Loss Answered,"This post cuts through the noise to answer your most common and crucial questions, focusing on **sustainable weight loss tips** that stick.

# 1. What is the single most important rule to start losing weight?

The one undeniable truth in weight loss is creating a **calorie deficit for beginners**.

No matter what diet you follow—Keto, Mediterranean, or simply eating less of what you love—if the number of calories you consume (**Calories In**) is less than the number of calories your body burns (**Calories Out**), you will lose weight. This is the foundation of CICO (Calories In, Calories Out).

* **Actionable Tip:** Don't start with a drastic deficit. Begin by cutting just 300-500 calories below your estimated maintenance level. This is often enough for a visible, manageable start without crashing your energy.

# 2. Is calorie tracking really necessary, and how to track calories accurately?

While CICO is the rule, tracking is the tool. For many, especially beginners, tracking is essential because people consistently under-estimate their true calorie intake.

* **Necessary?** Not forever. Many successfully transition to **weight loss without counting calories** once they have developed ""portion intuition"" and learned the calorie density of common foods.
* **Accurate Tracking Tips:**
   * **Use a Food Scale:** This is non-negotiable for accuracy, especially for things like cooking oil, nuts, and starches (rice, pasta).
   * **Log** ***Everything*****:** Don't forget creamer in your coffee, that handful of chips, or the sauces. These ""micro-calories"" add up fast.
   * **Be Honest:** If you binge, log the binge. The data is for you to learn from, not a morality test.

# 3. I'm stuck in a plateau. How do I figure out how to calculate maintenance calories now?

Plateaus are frustrating but completely normal. As you lose weight, your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) decrease because there is less of you to move!

The number you calculated at your starting weight is no longer accurate.

* **The Best Strategy: Use Your Data.** Don't rely on online calculators alone. Use the average calories you ate over the last 3-4 weeks *while your weight remained stable*—**that is your new maintenance calorie number**.
* **Next Step:** From that new maintenance number, re-establish your 300-500 calorie deficit. This adjustment often breaks the plateau immediately.

# 4. What is the role of protein and strength training?

These two elements are vital for a *successful* weight loss journey, which means losing **fat** and preserving (or even building) **muscle**.

* **Protein is King:** Higher protein intake is strongly linked to feeling fuller for longer, which makes maintaining a calorie deficit easier. It also provides the building blocks to prevent muscle loss while dieting.
* **Strength Training is Your Shield:** Muscle is metabolically active, meaning it burns more calories at rest than fat. Prioritize lifting weights or doing bodyweight exercises 2-3 times per week to protect and grow this calorie-burning engine.

# 5. My goal is big, and I'm losing motivation. What is the best way to stay consistent?

Consistency is the real superpower. When you lose motivation, you rely on discipline and small habits.

* **Set Non-Scale Goals (NSGs):** Instead of only focusing on the weight number, celebrate milestones like:
   * ""I ran for 15 minutes straight.""
   * ""I meal prepped four lunches this week.""
   * ""My old pants fit again!""
* **Find Your Community:** This is what Reddit is for! Share your victories and struggles in communities like r/\*\*\* The support from people who get it is an incredible motivator.
* **Embrace the 80/20 Rule:** Don't demand perfection. Aim to be consistent 80% of the time, leaving room to enjoy life (and your favorite foods) 20% of the time. This makes your plan a lifestyle, not a temporary diet.

Firstly I arrived at this university knowing just 1 person. A close friend of mine that happened to know her because they live close by. 1 month passed I would look at her, she would look at me but we never really interacted. One day we had a physics lab we sat next to each other and I decided to talk to her. We did our in-class work and had a assignment for next week. Unexpectedly she waited for me and wanted to meet me. We took a walk around campus for around an hour. Exchanged socials, i didn't think much since I wasn't really feeling anything about her. First week goes by we talk a little from dms she approached me and we started having small talks here and there or as we waited for public transport we would talk for a bit. Now second week comes by we had a common break from 10 till 12 I got a message she wanted to hang out. Again it was mostly about university and all that but slowly slowly we started learning eachother more and more. 



Another week goes by we continued to talk from Instagram but her response times would range from 2 minutes up until 30 hours. I mirrored her behavior to he fair since I didn't care at the time and then she started double texting to get my attention. Tuesday comes by and we have that common break (its the only time of the week we both have a common break). She Again reached out and wanted to hang out at a nearby coffee shop. This time it was different she Firstly showed me her presentation, then vented about different topics about her putting for class representative. She sat next to me leaned onto me and started talking about her problems and bullying she has been facing in class after a good 2 hours of talking and sharing opinions and seeing how much chemistry we had. I started actually taking a liking on this girl.



During that week I helped her socialize and speak to people in our lectures she never spoke to before. I also spread her opinions around class and managed to gather around 35 people to vote for her. Anyways she did end up losing but texted me the same day ""just know im greatful for everything you did ❤️❤️"".
After that her response times where immediate and would find every chance to be close to me.



Currently its exam week. She is stressed, im stressed everyone is. Her response times are 30-40 hours but sends me tik toks all day. Basically she finds chances to talk to me. Always smiles at me, stares at me when im not looking and her body language is open and different around me and gets closer to me than your average friend. She sends me big voice mails 10-15 minutes. Appreciates me because I understand her and vented how she was never really treated this way, having someone that isn't bored of her talking all day. She does have bad rumors going around in my class and that kind of hurts her.



Now what's the negatives you might ask. 2 days ago she started talking about a blue eyed boy that looks at her and she thinks she mightve took an interest. Then hit me with the ""Im here trying to do love but at the same time I don't want to do love."". Now I did try to hit her with the ""yeah I like a girl too"" card but she seemed a little unhinged about it. Didn't ask me any questions like who. She responded with ""I won't judge just tell me and ill see if I'll help.""



TL;DR I believe she seems me as a bestie/ friend but does invest alot of energy and wants to hang out 1 on 1. At the same time she compliments me and has this behavior. Im confused on how to continue this and what is really going on. She seems intrested but has pretty on and off behavior. Does speak to me daily at university and we will talk for a lengthy amount of time in or out of class. On Instagram she will leave me on delivered for 1 or 2 days. But proceeds to send me tik toks and answer to mine back. Its been around 4 weeks since we started talking. What do yall think?",1,1761696927.0,AskMenAdvice,4,1.0,False
1oiq3ou,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1oiq3ou/the_kids_in_my_town_drastically_change_on_their/,The kids in my town DRASTICALLY change on their 18th birthday.,"Ethan Harley shouldn’t have been crying at his own birthday party.

The party was in full swing, but it was the adults who were celebrating, while the birthday boy himself sat alone, his head buried in his lap. 

He was crying. I could tell by his shuddering shoulders, trying to bury himself in his lap and make himself smaller.

Ethan’s father greeted me with a rainbow cupcake and stroking my hair. 

I awkwardly laughed, shoving him away. “I'm seventeen, Mr Harley.”

I was pretty sure he still saw me as a child. 

Mr. Harley was like an uncle to me. He loomed over me at an impressive and slightly intimidating height, dark red hair slicked back, always wearing brightly colored pants and long trench coats. 

According to my mother, Ethan’s dad was the only one who could stop me from crying when I was a baby, pretending my screams were lyrics to a song he liked which cemented my nickname.

Personally, I just think my infant self was so confused by him singing over my screams that I immediately stopped. “Hello, Ruby Songbird!” he laughed, ruffling my hair again.

I inched away. “Still seventeen.”

“Dylan.” My mom’s face crinkled into a smile. “Congratulations.”

Mr. Harley nodded with a grin, his gaze flicking to me. I didn't notice, mesmerized by the huge cake sitting on a metal platter. I didn't see Ethan’s name on it, though. 

The little kids were running around while the adults stood in their own little groups, holding champagne glasses and whispering to each other.

I noticed they kept shooting glances at Ethan, who had moved to the backyard, now sitting on the edge of their pool. Mr. Harley was quick to usher me away so he could talk to my mom.

“All right, my little Songbird! Why don't you take this to my mopey son?” he chuckled, handing me a bowl of ice cream, gesturing to Ethan. “I thiiiiink he needs cheering up.”

I took the ice cream with a nervous laugh. “Uh, what's wrong with him?”

Mr. Harley’s lips twitched, and he and my mother shared a smile.

I was expecting a slightly passive aggressive explanation to why my age group were all *bad*, and that's exactly what I got. 

Mr. Harley nudged Mom playfully, his gaze snapping back to me. “It’s an illness that only affects teenagers, turning them into evil monsters who refuse to do what their parents say.”

He held out the ice cream, covering it with chocolate sauce. “Right now, *this* is the only cure we have. Ethan prefers vanilla, but one bowl of this, and I'm sure his… *symptoms* will clear up.”

I shot Mom a pained look, and she nudged me a little too hard. 

So, I took the ice-cream. “Yeah, um, sure, I'll give him his *cure*.”

Mom’s smile was a warning. 

*Do not push it*. 

I had to resist the urge to outwardly cringe. Ethan’s father was… a lot. 

Ethan himself used to be a great guy. We grew up together, bonding over our birthdays only being two weeks apart, so it was always me and him. 

He was the boy next door, the two of us growing up facing each other's windows. He was that freckled awkward little kid, and then, he made my stomach kind of flutter.

We started junior high hand in hand, promising to stay friends forever. 

Yeah, that lasted maybe two fucking minutes. Boys and puberty don't mix. 

Suddenly, he was drawing his curtains and blocking me out. I called him out, of course, and to my surprise, he apologised for being an asshole. We reconciled and our friendship groups merged together. 

But over the last few months, Ethan stopped knocking on my door and ignored me when I shouted his name across the street. 

When I texted his friends, and then *my* friends, I got no answer. 

Look, I was already a little weirded out by the sudden dramatic change in behavior in some of my classmates when they reached the big one-eight. Jesse Radcliffe and Aris Mora, Ethan’s friends, were the latest casualties. 

In the space of two weeks, the two of them had turned from obnoxious jocks to I wasn't even sure.

Was there a word for a complete change in personality/behavior? 

These guys used to spend their Friday nights in the diner, drinking beers and trying to hit on the 20 year old waitress. 

Now, from what I heard, they stayed inside and watched English *golf.*

Whatever happened to them, it freaked Ethan out.

He stopped returning my calls, and just went totally silent. 

At school, he shoved past me, completely ignoring my existence. 

Ethan’s mother called it “typical teenage behavior” when he and a group of guys from school tried to run away from home. 

They were caught, and ever since then, Ethan had become a different person. 

He told me to fuck off a week prior, and I didn’t like the sudden hollowness in his eyes. 

Ethan didn't look happy on his *happy* day, and part of me wasn't surprised

But hey, it was his eighteenth, he should have been at least forcing a smile. 

When his mother gently pulled him into the house to join in on the birthday song, he reluctantly dragged himself inside, rolling his eyes the whole time. I noticed him playing with a keychain, a little Pokémon attached to it, his fingers wrapping around and squeezing it for dear life. 

I was pretty sure it was a gift from Aris. Speaking of, he was keeping his distance for some reason, hanging out with all the parents. 

I did catch looks between them. Ethan, glaring at his friend, and Aris, grinning back at him, saluting his birthday with his glass of… whiskey? 

Didn't Aris hate the stuff? I vaguely remembered him throwing up on my sneakers during a summer camp out. 

When Ethan was told to blow out his candles, the boy refused, and to my surprise, violently shoved his mother away when she tried to pull him into a hug. Mrs. Harley looked hurt, but she maintained her smile.

“Ethan.” Her tone was still gentle, despite her strained grin. “Baby, blow out your candles and thank everyone for coming.”

Ethan didn't move, his face bathed in warm candlelight. 

I tried to meet his eyes, but he refused to look at me. 

I was only met with empty darkness, and a stranger with my best friend’s face.

“No,” he whispered, wrapping his arms around himself.

Ethan’s response was met with low murmurs in the crowd.

“Young man,” Mr. Harley spoke up this time, his smile stretching a little too thin. 

Ethan’s tone terrified me.  He lifted his head, glaring at his parents. “It's not my *fucking* birthday.”

I tried not to notice Jesse smirking at the corner of my eye. 

Ethan’s mother burst into tears, and my own eyes started to sting. 

“Ethan!” Mr Harley chastised. “Apologize to your mother!”

The boy stood very still for a moment, before a smile slowly pricked on his lips. I saw his body relax, his shoulders slumping. His fingers twined around the key chain went limp, and he stuffed it in his pocket. “You're right, Mom,” Ethan smiled brightly, but there were tears in his eyes.

When Ethan was caught running away from home, he freaked out, trying and failing to hide the conflicting emotions. This time, he let the tears fall, soaking the collar of his shirt. But he was still smiling.

“Thanks for the cake, *Mom*,” he said, before plucking a still-lit candle from the frosting and dropping it into his mouth. Luckily, Mr. Harley forced him to spit it out. 

“Relax!” Ethan laughed, “Wow, guys, it's almost like you don't want me to hurt myself!”

Mrs Harley was still trying to smile, her eyes wild. “Ethan, *stop*.”

“Stop *what*?” The birthday boy surprised me with a grin, his gaze meeting mine. 

“What's wrong, *Mom*? Isn't this what you've always wanted?” He started cramming candles into his mouth in a frenzy, choking on them. But that didn't stop him trying to stuff more down his throat. They were quickly taken away.

After a very brief hissing match with his parents, he saluted them with a rebellious grin,  grabbed the cake, and planted his face directly into rainbow frosting before collapsing into hysterical giggles. 

There was a stunned silence, and I think both of his parents were on the edge of their tether, before the crowd, mainly the adults, started laughing, leaving me the only one who wasn't. 

Jesse and Aris were howling, the two of them slapping their thighs, like this was comedy genius. A shiver slowly slithered down my spine. Ethan was sobbing. Through his violent laughter, tears running down his cheeks, choking him. He shot his father a wide grin, licking frosting from his lips and chin. 

“I thought you *wanted* me to celebrate my birthday?” the boy danced over to the cupcakes, stuffing them into his mouth. 

“I'm having a great time!”

I started forwards to stop him, but my mother, who was joining in with the cacophony of shrieking laughter, yanked me back. 

“It's not our business, Ruby.” Mom said, shoving a drink in my face. 

“Sweetie, have a drink!”

I don't think any of us were expecting Ethan to pour the entirety of the chocolate fountain over his head, which set the kids around me into fits of hysterical laughter. 

“Please ignore our son!” Mr. Harley told the crowd. “He's just being a typical teenager!”

The crowd laughed *louder*, and something slimy crept up my throat. 

Ethan was self-destructing, and I couldn't bear watching. 

I turned to Mom to ask if I could leave, but she was already talking to Ethan’s friends, her lips brushing the edge of a wine glass. 

There were several things wrong with what I was seeing, and I remember trying to swallow down soda that was creeping back up my throat. 

Mom didn’t usually talk to the older kids. I remember her telling me to stay away from Jesse and Aris, both of whom she was now deep in conversation with. 

When Ethan ran away from home, Jesse and Aris were caught along with him. 

I wasn’t supposed to be watching out of my window, but I did. I saw a very heated conversation between my mother and the two boys. 

Something about staying away from me and leaving Ethan alone. The last time I saw them, the two were standing on our front lawn throwing bricks at our door. 

Now, however, it seemed like Mom was friends with them. Jesse kept nudging her like they were best pals, while Aris swirled wine around his glass. 

I couldn’t make out their words, but they kept stealing glances at Ethan and whispering to each other. 

Jesse and Aris didn't seem like the gossiping types, but somehow they looked comfortable with the adults, exchanging greetings with other guests and laughing with my mother. 

They were even dressed weirdly, swapping casual hooded sweatshirts and jeans for more formal dress shirts and pants. Jesse’s converse were already dirty from walking around in the foliage. 

When they were caught by their parents, the three were clinging onto each other. Jesse and Aris were dragged away screaming, and Ethan was pulled back inside. Mom caught me peeking, and she was *pissed.* 

Now, the two boys barely even looked at Ethan, except shooting him judgemental glances over their wine glasses. When the party resumed, the music was cranked up, and nobody was paying attention to Ethan Harley except for me. 

My gut twisted, no matter how many times I tried to convince myself that everything was okay. I watched him, still smeared in frosting, hovering over what was left of his cake. 

He was rocking backwards and forwards, unsteady, and I saw it, his fingers twitched, and in one quick motion, he snatched up the abandoned cake knife. I didn't like his smile, the sudden sparkle in his eyes. 

Like he was going to self-destruct even more. 

Mrs Harley, however, was quick to pull the knife from his fingers, and his arms dropped to his sides, his expression crumpling. She was surprisingly gentle with him, wrapping her arms around him and leading him out into the backyard. 

Ethan plonked himself on the edge of the pool, ignoring his mother's attempts to talk to him. She gave him a towel and told him to wipe his face, and he didn't respond, throwing the towel into the pool.

When Mrs Harley rested a hand on his shoulder, the boy jerked away– and she gave up, leaving him alone. I decided to join him, dipping my toes in iridescent water, comforted by the cool temperature. 

“Ethan.” I said. 

“Go away, Ruby.”  he grumbled. 

I shuffled slightly to the left. “What exactly are you doing?”

Ethan surprised me with a sigh, tipping his head back and blinking at the blistering sun. “I'm trying to figure out how to inconspicuously drown myself in a kid's pool.”

“Oh.” I kicked my legs in the water. “Sounds fun.”

Keeping my eyes on water sparkling under late afternoon sunlight, I offered Ethan the dessert, and to my surprise, he took it, offering me a watery smile. “Thanks.”

“Ethan.” I said again. 

I wasn't sure how to ask him what was going on with him, but I didn't need to. 

“I don't want to talk about it.” He leaned back, his mouth pricking into a smile. “If I’m honest, I just want to enjoy the summer breeze on my face,” he leaned over, tracing the water with his fingers, “Maybe go skinny dipping when the kids are gone.”

When he started spooning desert into his mouth, I couldn't resist. “Soooo, what did your candles taste like? Were they as tasty as you were expecting them to be?”

Ethan’s gaze was glued to his friends laughing with the adults. 

Jesse and Aris were embedded in a conversation with my Mom, the three of them drinking  coffee with the other parents. Ethan’s lips curled in disgust, but I also saw hurt, like it *hurt* him to even look at them. “Like fucking rainbows, dude.”

“Ignore them,” I muttered, “They're being assholes.”

The boy turned to me, his eyes swollen red. “Don't say that.”

“What? That your best friends who abandoned you are complete fucking jerks?”

I wasn't expecting him to hide his face, sniffling into his sweater sleeve. “You've got no idea what you're talking about,” he said, his tone hardening. “Just go home.”

I tried to smile, but my stomach was twisting into knots. 

I started to get up, brushing myself down. 
“Well, happy birthday.”

He sighed, planting his cakey face in his lap. “I've told you, it's not my birthday.”

Ethan lifted his head,  but he didn't look at me, his gaze somewhere else entirely. Lost in the sinking rays of the dying sun. “It's my Dad’s.” 

He shuffled closer, leaning his head on my shoulder.

“Can you make me a promise, Ruby?” 
 
“Uh, sure.” 

I felt my cheeks redden. 

When we were little kids, Ethan asked me to marry him. 

I said, “Maybe when we’re adults.”

Ethan was frowning at a pool floaty, his eyes turning impossibly dark, impossibly hollow, Something in my gut twisted, a sliver of ice cream creeping its way back up my throat. 

He reached out and grabbed my hand, squeezing my fingers. “Before you’re eighteen, I want you to do something important,” he said, his voice splintering. Ethan turned to me, his expression twisted with fright, with hopelessness I would never understand. 

I swallowed. “What's that?”

Ethan shuffled away from me. “Can you die for me?” 

Ethan looked up at me–his eyes were red from crying.

He was terrified, and I didn't know why. “No matter what happens, you have to promise me you will die before you turn eighteen.” he held out his pinkie for a pinky promise, just like when we were kids. 

I couldn't resist a laugh, but his expression was serious. 

“I'm sorry, *what*?”

Ethan averted his gaze. His hands were trembling. “Do you want to know a secret?”

“Not really,” I muttered. “Look, I can understand that you're scared to turn eighteen, that it's a big age for responsibility and becoming an adult, but it's also still *young*.” I shivered.

“I'm not excited of the idea of leaving home and being a responsible adult either, *but* we all have to at some point.” 

I was babbling, trying to hide that I was fucking terrified of what my friend was trying to say. I rested my head on his shoulder. I expected warmth, but he was so unnaturally *cold*. The sun was slowly eclipsed by clouds, and all the warmth was sucked from the air. 

It was suddenly so cold, an icy breeze violently blowing my hair back. I wrapped my arms around myself. 

“Just… promise *me* you'll start seeing a therapist.”

I found myself staring into the pool, where the water suddenly didn't look so welcoming. 

“Therapy.” Ethan said it like a joke, tipping his head back. “Sure.”

*“Ethan!""*

Lifting my head, Lila Fabrey was looming over him. 

Ever since *her* eighteenth birthday, Lila wasn't acting like herself either. 

Like the boys, a key member of our gang had turned from a signature potty mouthed cheerleader, to a stranger in the space of a single day. She grabbed him and yanked him to his feet. 

Instead of hanging around with Ethan, she had spent the afternoon drinking with the adults. She wasn't alone. 

Jesse and Aris had joined her. “What is the *matter* with you?” she hissed. “You can't talk to Ruby like that!”

Lila had this weird mother-like tone that was both jarring and frustrating. 

“I'm fine.” I managed to choke out, aware we had an audience. 

Lila shook her head. “No, sweetie, what he said was uncalled for,” she said, folding her arms. “Ethan, apologize to her.” 

When he didn't respond, she tapped her foot. “Now!”

“You're making a fool out of yourself, boy.” Jesse said, shaking his head. 

Ethan looked paralysed for a moment, staring at his friends, his lips parting like he was going to speak, before his expression crumpled.

“Not her face.” He whispered, his wild eyes snapping to all three of them, and then he was moving, stumbling back, his breaths coming out in sharp pants.

“That's not fair.” Ethan broke out into a sob.

When he dropped to his knees, Lila started towards him, he shuffled back, terrified. 

“Ethan—”

“Get the FUCK away from me!”

Ethan’s eyes found mine, and he sputtered out a laugh. “Do you remember our promise?”

I didn't move, my hands were trembling by my sides. 

Ethan’s parents were quick to grab and pull him to his feet, but he was laughing. “I told your daughter to die,” he spat at my mother, struggling in his father’s arms. “Because what’s the alternative, Mrs. Chase?”

Mom didn't respond, which made him laugh harder. 

“Well?” Ethan yelped when his arms were pinned behind his back. “What is the fucking alternative?”

By now, the whole party was watching his breakdown. 

Mom pulled me into her arms when Ethan was dragged away, still screaming. 

I shoved her away, rattled by his words. “What's he talking about, Mom?”

Mom didn't respond for a moment, her lips pursed. “He is… clearly mentally unwell.”

“Answer me!” His wails were like knives stabbing into my spine, his violent struggles, his attempts to rip from his parents embrace, only to scuttle backwards on his hands, and try and run before Mr Harley scooped him into his arms. 

“Get off of me! Let me go! You assholes!” Ethan kicked and screamed, “He… he's not even my real father–”

Whatever he was going to say was promptly muffled by his mother. 

When Ethan was gone, presumably dragged to his room for a talking to, I tried to follow him. 

Jesse Radcliffe blocked my way, fixing me with a wide smile. 

This was the same guy who used to burp the alphabet. 

He took a step towards me, and I found myself stumbling back towards the pool edge. 

“He's fine,” Jesse said. “Ethan is just in a time-out.”

“Right.” I said, “Well, I just want to talk to him—”

He blocked my way again. “His parents are dealing with him.” The boy slowly cocked his head, his gaze drinking me in, as if for the first time. “When is *your* birthday again, Ruby?” he asked casually.

I tried to sidestep away from him, but Aris was behind me, his breath tickling my neck. These were my friends! But why was I so fucking scared of them?

Why, no matter how hard I tried, couldn’t I recognize their eyes?

“It's in two weeks.” I managed to get out. “You should *know* that.”

Jesse nodded slowly, his smile widening. “I'm excited,” he murmured. 

Jesse had zero concept of personal space, stepping closer, despite just a few months ago, complaining that I gave him eyesores. He was joking. 

Jesse and I were like brother and sister. When we played video games, he tugged out my controller so I couldn't join in. Looking at him now, he was a stranger with my friend’s face, a grinning NPC staring straight through me. Jesse lifted his glass, as if saluting my upcoming birthday too. 

“There's nothing better than seeing a girl blossom into a young woman.”

Definitely not something Jessie would *ever* say. 

Unless he had substantial brain damage.

I had an idea. 

It was a stupid idea, but it was an *idea*. 

Instead of responding to that, I grabbed his arm and tugged him into the hallway. To my surprise, he followed me. 

“Do you know when we, uh, hooked up in the back of your Dad’s car?” I whispered. 

His expression crumpled with *disgust*, but he nodded. “Yes, of course I do.”

“I'm pregnant,” I whispered, and it was when his eyes flew open in terror, and he stumbled away, quickly excusing himself, that I knew I wasn't talking to Jesse Radcliffe.

Jesse is gay, still in the closet– and would rather commit seppuku (his words, not mine) than be intimate with any female - let alone *me*.

I could sense phantom bugs filling my mouth. 

What the actual fuck?

I wouldn't put anything past our close knit tiny community, which thrived on youth. The parents seemed more excited than the kids themselves over turning eighteen.

I spent the rest of the party sitting on the edge of the pool waiting for Ethan to come back. 

I had a conceptual plan. When he did come back, we were going to get the fuck out of town and start a new life somewhere else. 

Party guests started to leave, the sky above me darkening. 

I was watching the sunset, pretty streaks of red and orange, when Mom came to give me a slice of birthday cake. I threw it in the pool when she wasn't looking. 

I kept expecting Ethan to plonk down next to me, but he didn't. I figured the boy was on an *indefinite* grounding; at least until he left for college. 

Mom was still talking to Ethan’s friends, and there was no sign of the birthday boy or his parents. I jumped up, shivering, and headed back into the house, slipping through the sliding glass doors. 

The kitchen was a mess, and I snatched up a plastic cup of orange vodka, downing it. 

I was busy staring at the cracked wallpaper when a sudden shriek rattled my skull. 

Ethan. 

Before I could stop myself, I followed his cries through a door I didn't recognise, which led me onto a long white hallway. 

This part of the Harley household felt cold, almost sterile. 

Untouched. 

“Ethan?” I whispered, cringing when my voice echoed. 

There was a door at the end of the hallway, and something was pulling me toward it. I remember it feeling narrow, almost otherworldly. 

I took slow steps, dragging my fingers down the pale white walls. I remember disliking the texture. It was too clinical, fake, even, like venturing down the hallways of an emergency room. 

When I peeked through the gap in the door, the first thing I saw was… red. Everywhere.

It was wet on the floor, pooling between my bare toes. 

The room was too white, with bright lights shining in my eyes. I don't think I had fully registered the wet warmth between my toes and trickling through the gaps in the floor tiles at that point. I took a single step forward, blinking rapidly. 

Ethan was strapped to a scary looking metal bed. 

“Ruby.” His voice was more of a breath. I heard both relief and terror. 

“You shouldn't… be here.” He let out a wet sounding sob, wrenching at velcro restraints, and I could see him trembling. I took another step, like my body was in control of my mind. 

I might have been screaming, but I couldn't hear anything. All I could hear was the wet-sounding drip of Ethan’s blood hitting the floor. The red was coming from him, slicking his skin like paint. 

Initially, I thought Ethan really *was* scared of being an adult. He was so scared, in fact, that he had tried to hurt himself. I could see the claw marks from his own nails, his teeth trying to tear into his own skin. But Ethan looked strangely calm, like he was meditating.

He twisted his head, and I noticed straps pinning his shoulders to the table. “Can you do me a solid and grab a scalpel?”

I found my voice, standing on my tip-toes to grasp for one on the top shelf above him. 

In person I hesitated, but inside, my mind was screaming. 

When I tried to cut the restraints pinning his ankles, he shook his head violently. 

“No, that's not what I meant. Please *kill* me.” He whispered in a hysterical giggle. When I checked his eyes, his pupils were huge, dilated.

“What did your parents do to you?” I managed to choke out. 

I was met with a giggle. “Parents?” He scoffed. “They're not my parents! More like my great, great, great, great, great, great–”

Footsteps sounded, and I slammed my hand over his mouth. Someone was coming. Ethan was still giggling to himself, muttering, *great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great* into my hand. 

Looking for an escape, there was none. The only place I could hide was— I panicked, dropping to my knees and crawling under the bed. 

Ethan somehow caught hold of himself, sobering up at the sound of his mother's heeled footsteps closing in on us. 

“Ruby.” His voice spluttered into a helpless sob that broke my heart. “Get the fuck *out* of here. I don't want you to see this.”

I wanted to, but the door was already opening and then slamming shut. 

I glimpsed two pairs of shoes. Heels, and white converse smeared with dirt. 

I recognised those shoes, though I wasn't sure where *from*. 

“Please, Mom.” Ethan’s voice was a whimper. “Please don't fucking do this to me.” 

Mrs Harley’s heel clacks sent chills spiking through me. 

In four steps, she was hovering over her son, and I found myself scootching back. 

Something hit the floor with a loud  *clang*, and I had to bite back a cry, my mouth filling with blood when I bit through my tongue. 

The scalpel.

Mrs. Harley’s chuckle was unreal.

“Ethan, sweetie, you know I'm not your mother. I have never seen you as a son.”

“Derek.” Ethan spoke through his teeth. “Jesse fucking hated you.”

It was Jesse’s laugh that sent my thoughts into a whirlwind. 

“Thank you.” Jesse snorted. “I wasn't particularly fond of the boy, either.”

“Ethan, that's rude.” Mrs Harley hissed. “Be nice to your friend.”

“He's not my–” Ethan burst into sobs, the bed rattling with the force of his squirming. 

“Mom, please don't do this.”

The sudden screeching sound of blades was so deafening that I slapped my hand over my mouth, muffling a cry. Ethan let out a single, piercing wail, as if he was trying to cry out, before he... He just… stopped. 

Everything about him stopped, his sharp, panting breaths and his violent struggling. 

I thought Mrs. Harley had shown mercy, had come to her senses. 

But then… it started to rain inside the white room? Ethan Harley had gone deathly silent. It was just a wet spot on my forehead, at first. I swiped at it, and my hand was bright red. My brain processed slower than my body. Blood. 

When I realized what was raining from the sky or in my case, pooling over the edge of Ethan’s bed, the shrieking screech of blades started up again.

The noise was so loud, ringing in my skull, I thought it would never stop.

Half aware, I clawed at my face to muffle my own hysterical shrieks. I don't know why I couldn't move. I froze, paralysed, watching fleshy white strips of flesh and hair dropping into rapidly spreading red stretching across the floor. 

My stomach was twisting and turning, my mouth filling with bile. When the blades stopped, I was sitting very still, my eyes full of bright red. I barely noticed that I was soaked in blood.

It was dripping in thick rivulets down my face, warm and wet and utterly grotesque.

I don't think I'll ever forget that sensation. 

*Ethan* was in my mouth, in my eyes, running down my chin. 

I couldn't move, my knees pressed to my chest, vomit staining my shirt.

“*Hello*, sweetie.”

Ethan’s mother’s voice slowly pricked something inside me. 

I didn't know I had my eyes squeezed shut, until gloved hands fingers were wrapping around my ponytail, and yanking me from my hiding spot. 

I kept my eyes shut, clenching them against the tears, trying to tug away from her, my mouth full of stale barf. 

When I was politely placed in a plastic chair, I sensed Mrs Harley crouched in front of me. Her breath tickled my cheeks. “Ruby, you can open your eyes,” she hummed, “I've… cleaned everything up.”

I did, against my better judgement. 

Prying open my eyes, I was suddenly aware of Mrs Harley swiping at my face with tissue paper. Behind her was what I was trying to escape, trying to pretend didn't exist. But he was still there, reduced to a limp body covered with a white sheet, his hand hanging off of the surface. 

When his fingers twitched, suddenly, something acrid filled my mouth. 

“All better.” Mrs Harley straightened up, fixing me with a wide smile. “Now, I know you have questions, and all will be answered in due course. But right now, I have a surprise for you.”

The woman turned around and pulled a paper party hat from her pocket, before placing it on my head. I didn't move. I *couldn't* move. I was still watching Ethan’s blood fill the gaps between the floor tiles. “Happy early birthday, Ruby.”

I started to jump up, adrenaline driving me to my feet. 

But then, Mom walked in. 

I screamed for her, immediately wanting my *mother*. 

But her wide, satisfied smile only sent me into hysteria. 

Mom’s gaze flicked to Ethan’s body. “You were careful with the body, correct?” 

“Of course I was.” Mrs Harley said, pulling me to my feet to another empty bed. She slammed me down, pinning my wrists and ankles. “Michael is just resting, Iris. He'll be up and about in no time, do not worry.” 

Mrs Harley nodded to my Mom, who rolled her eyes like a teenager. “Go and get yourself prepared. I will be ready when you are.”

Mom scoffed. 

“Oh, please,” she said, “Derek waited three days before his rebirth into his little brat.” 

Mom started towards me, her face growing monstrous, her eyes flicking up and down my struggling body. This thing had been wearing my mother for as long as I'd known her, and all that time I was nothing but her end goal.

“I've waited so long,” she hummed, pulling at her own cheeks, “Inside this… ancient, stretchy trash bag.” she prodded at my face with her manicure. “I want to watch it happen!” 

Mrs Harley hesitated, before nodding, pulling on fresh gloves.

“Of course, Iris.”

I won't describe what my ‘mother’ did to me, because it fucking hurts. 

What I do remember is her savage grin when spinning blades started up. 

I was too choked up to scream, my body was stuck. 

Paralysed. 

But before those blades could rip me apart, turning me into a second skin, both my mother and Mrs Harley hit the ground. 

Before I knew what was happening, Ethan was looming over me, a metal tray in his hands. He was covered in blood, still dressed in the blue scrubs he died in. His hair had been shaved off, leaving him with bald, rugged skin held together by stitches. 

Ethan blinked rapidly, the tray slipping from his fingers. He looked confused, slowly inclining his head, before grabbing a scalpel. For a moment, it looked like he was going to drag it across his own throat. 

It *wasn't* Ethan. 

He cut through my restraints with trembling hands. I jumped off the bed, reaching to grab him and pull him with me only to find, to my confusion, that he was kneeling on the floor, helping his mother stand. 

He didn't even look at me, wrapping his arms around his psychotic mother. 

When he *did* lift his head, his lip was curled in disgust, eyes narrowed into slits. 

“Sweetie,” Ethan shook his mother. “Honey, she's getting *away*.”

I had half a mind to finish my mother off right then and there.

But I got out of there. 

Aris Mora stepped in front of me, and I saw it straight away. 

How did I never *see* it? 

Stitches, just below his hairline. 

So subtle, but right *there*.

I couldn't control myself, quickly shoving past him and running - as fast and far as my feet could take me.

I realized that day, that Aris and Jesse weren't just dead: they were hollow skins filled with monsters. 

Once I was far away from the Harley household, I hid under an old bridge for three days. I stole Mom’s car, with the intention to get the fuck out of dodge. 

I got all the way to the intersection leaving town, before headlights were blinding me. I expected the cops, or *worse*, my mother herself– hunting me down for what she thought was *hers*. But when Ethan Harley stumbled out of his car, I think something inside me snapped in two. 

It was his expression. He looked like Ethan again, wide frightened eyes blinking at me. But I could also see the stitches under thick brown wig, marking him as one of *them*. 

In my mind, there was zero way my neighbor, my best friend, could survive *that*. 

I had come prepared, obviously. 

I didn't know how to use it, but it was just point and shoot, right? 

I pulled out my mother’s gun, pointing it right between the boy's unfocused eyes.

“Why are you here?” was all that I could choke out.

He shrugged. “I don't know.” he kept blinking, like he was genuinely confused. “I was in my backyard planting flowers,” his face crumpled, “and now I'm standing here.”

His words took me off guard. 

I tightened my fingers around the gun, struggling with the trigger. “What did your birthday candles taste like?” I demanded. 

Ethan looked confused, his lips curling into a smile. 

“What?”

I swallowed a shriek. “Your birthday candles! What did they *taste* like?”

“Rainbows.” Ethan said, and when I found myself fingering the trigger, he flinched, throwing his hands up. “Like *fucking* rainbows!” He corrected himself. “Jesus, Ruby, can you please put the gun down?”

I did, letting harsh metal slip through my fingers. 

“I don't have time to explain,” he said. I noticed he was keeping his distance. “But I can get you away from your Mom.”

I didn't realize I was trembling until I was on my knees, my throat clogged with sobs. 

“How did you find out?” I spoke to the ground, my chest aching. 

It wasn't Ethan. 

But it was also *was*?

Ethan’s small smile crumpled, and he lowered his hands. 

“I snuck into Jesse’s house on his brother’s eighteenth birthday,” he said shakily. It started to rain, and I could barely feel it dampening my hair, sticking my clothes to my skin. 

Ethan stepped closer to me. When we were face to face, he prodded the scar that monster gave me. 

“There were four of us, and…” His voice shook. “We saw everything.” Ethan pretended to fold his arms across his chest, but I could see him trembling. “We were fifteen.” he heaved out a breath. “So, we dedicated every year following to escaping this fucking town.”

Something in his eyes turned dark, a shiver sliding down my spine. 

“But, you know,” he shot me a watery smile. “That didn't happen.” 

Ethan gestured to his car. He told me he was going to take me to a safe place. 

When I jumped into the passenger seat, there was a gun sticking from the glove compartment. But I knew it wasn't for me. 

I didn't question his jerking head, or his hands slick with blood wrapped around the steering wheel, every time he gingerly stroked the stitches still lining his forehead. 

He wasn't stable.  I could tell by the way his body moved, like he was fighting his own limbs. But that didn't stop him shooting me a small grin and cranking up the radio, singing along to Fall Out Boy. 

I found myself relaxing in my seat, my eyes flickering, sleep finally biting me. 

But sitting there against the backdrop of a rainy evening, I finally let myself *sleep*. 

I was hesitant at first, but his hand found my arm. It was warm. 

“It's okay.” Ethan’s voice was a low murmur. “You can sleep.”

When he pulled up at a hotel, Ethan tried to drive away. 

But I was pretty sure he was trying to get rid of the monster inside his head. 

I told him to stay with me, and if his behavior turned erratic, I promised I would shoot him. 

The good news is, we've had Ethan’s parents’ cash to afford us being on the run. 

I got a card through the mail, and I knew exactly what it was.

I don't know how she's found me. Maybe Ethan didn't murder his father after all. 

The birthday card was home-made, covered in glitter. 

*Happy birthday, my dearest Ruby! I'm sure by now, you should be feeling the effects of being so far away from me. 

I think we both know I deserve what is mine. I have waited 18 years, sweetheart. Do not make me come and get you myself. You have until your birthday eve, darling. Then I will be taking matters into my own hands.*

*Can't wait to see you again!*

*So much love*, 

*Mommy.*

Ethan tore up the cards and burned them. 

He stays up all night with a baseball bat to protect us.

I'm turning 18 next week, and I'm starting to understand what ‘Mom’ wrote. I've mostly been couch crashing, lying about my age and trying to finish my senior year. 

But over the last few days (weeks, maybe) it's like my body is rejecting me. It took me an hour to get out of bed, to even open my eyes, despite my brain being wide awake. 

My body is getting worse. I woke up this morning, and I can't eat anything. 

My arms are aching even fucking typing this. Fuck, it's like my body is screaming at me. I keep throwing up, and every time, it feels like my body is rejecting *me*.

I'm probably less brain foggy and a bit more alert during the day.  My downcycle around 3 - 5 pm is still brutal and I still periodically doze off in my chair at home during the last dregs of work hours.  I'm still tweaking and tuning my numbers and I haven't had that ""epiphany"" moment where I realize that the world is a much better place after CPAP.

But...

A week ago I was heading out on a six hour drive to a vacation by myself.  I've never actually fallen asleep on the interstate before while driving, but holy crap those afternoons are brutal!  You fight drowsiness all afternoon, live rest stop to rest stop so you can get out to move and wake back up.  You know all the coffee houses between where you take off from and where you're going to go to because caffeine might as well be a prescription drug for safe arrival.

I left in the morning with a cup of coffee and a soda, stopped at lunch time part way through the trip and arrived at about 5ish.  And not ONCE did I feel like I was falling asleep at the wheel.  I wasn't using any of my usual tricks, wasn't even listening to amazingly interesting podcasts or whatever to keep myself awake.  It was me, alone with my thoughts for 6 hours and at no point did I ever feel the need to pull over and take a nap.  My next TTRPG campaign got a lot of mental work done on it on that drive.

It's no miracle occurrence: on the way back home I got a little tired...so nothing life changing yet...but it's there.  It's small, but it's there.

Hi there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

I am an English guy 

So firstly I’m not conservative and I’m not from the USA anyway and I am not religious the way I am is my own personal choice and how I have wanted to live my Life. I’m not intending to offend anyone at all I would ask those to be respectful towards me don’t report this post if you don’t like it im a very decent man I know what I want in life and I want to find a decent woman! If I don’t appeal to you please just move on! 

Any women from the USA or Canada please message me I want to hear from you I love your accents! 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 35 hanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy.

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone I loved and cared about 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after.

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I’m not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv.

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly not showing too much off with revealing clothing. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

I dont have any physical looks requirements other than I like natural looking women

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv.

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly not showing too much off with revealing clothing. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

I dont have any physical looks requirements other than I like natural looking women 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

1oips1h,https://www.reddit.com/r/MotivationByDesign/comments/1oips1h/advice_how_i_tricked_my_brain_into_being/,[Advice] How I tricked my brain into being productive again: the NO-BS guide that finally worked,"Way too many people right now are quietly drowning in burnout. They bounce between motivation videos, TikTok advice from 19-year-olds with ring lights, and productivity tools they never open again. Being constantly busy but weirdly unproductive has become the new normal. If that’s you, this post might help.

This isn’t another “just wake up at 5 am and drink lemon water” thread. This is based on what actually works, backed by real research, books, podcasts, and behavioral science. Had to unlearn a bunch of toxic hustle culture takes and relearn how productivity actually operates in a human brain, not a robot.

Here’s what helped and might work for you too:

- Productivity is not about doing more, it’s about doing less distracted. Cal Newport’s book *Deep Work* breaks this down. The brain can’t handle constant task-switching. Try blocking 90 minutes of uninterrupted time for focused work and treat it like a meeting. Don’t let your phone, Slack, or tabs mess it up.

- You’re not lazy, you’re overstimulated. Dopamine overload from scrolling kills your drive to do boring but important things. Dr. Anna Lembke’s *Dopamine Nation* explains how overstimulation leads to under-productivity. Quick fix? Do a dopamine detox for 24 hours. No phone, no sugar, no screen binging. Your brain resets surprisingly fast.

- Stop trying to rely on motivation. The *Huberman Lab Podcast* nails this: discipline comes from systems. Habits don’t form by willpower. They form by reducing friction. Put your to-do list on paper, not in your head. Set up your environment so doing the right thing is default. E.g., if you want to write in the morning, sleep with your laptop on the table, not your phone.

- Your body controls your brain. Productivity starts with sleep, movement, and food. Matthew Walker’s sleep research shows even one bad night reduces focus and memory by over 40%. If you’re tired and can’t focus, it’s not you being lazy. It’s your brain literally glitching. Fix your sleep first.

- The 3-task rule works better than any planner. From *Make Time* by Knapp & Zeratsky (former Google designers): pick 3 meaningful tasks per day, no more. Prioritize for energy, not urgency. Don’t start your day checking email or messages. Start with the one task that moves the needle.

- Your “future self” is not a different person. Behavioral scientist Katy Milkman (from Wharton) says procrastination happens because we treat our future selves like strangers. Trick your brain by making the benefits of finishing a task feel immediate. Set up a reward that hits today, not someday.

- Anxiety is often just unstructured time. When your calendar has big empty gaps, your brain fills it with dread. Structure your time even if you’re not super busy. Pomodoro method, time blocking, or even “fake meetings” with yourself help. Less freedom = more peace when you're overwhelmed.

- Movement boosts focus. Cognitive science from Stanford and University of Illinois shows that walking for 10 minutes increases creativity and attention by 60%. If you feel stuck, get up and move. Walking outside resets the brain way faster than forcing yourself to sit and “grind”.

- Phone addiction is killing your ability to focus. And it’s designed that way. Nir Eyal, author of *Indistractable*, explains how tech hijacks attention with variable reward systems. Solution: turn your phone grayscale. Use apps like Forest to gamify not using your phone. Or go full cold turkey with a digital Sabbath on weekends.

- Your identity shapes your actions. If you want to be productive, stop saying “I’m terrible with time” or “I have no discipline.” James Clear (*Atomic Habits*) says identity-based habits work better than goal-based ones. Say “I’m the kind of person who finishes what they start.” Then act like it for 2 minutes. Repeat.

- Set up “activation triggers.” Dr. BJ Fogg from Stanford talks about this in *Tiny Habits*. It’s easier to start a task if it's paired with a cue. After I pour coffee, I open my laptop. After I brush my teeth, I review tomorrow’s tasks. The smaller the starting point, the more likely you’ll start at all.

- You don’t need a system. You need a rhythm. Burnout often comes from trying to be productive *every* day. Energy isn’t linear. Build a weekly rhythm: 3 high-output days, 1 admin day, 1 creative day, 2 rest or low-load days. This works better than forcing 100% every day and crashing.

- Deadlines make you care. Self-imposed deadlines are usually ignored. But Parkinson’s Law is real: work expands to fill available time. Try public accountability. Tell a friend, post your goal, or use apps like StickK that make you pay money if you don't follow through.

- Celebrate small wins. This isn’t fluffy advice. Research from Harvard Business School (Teresa Amabile) shows that recognizing small progress is the #1 predictor of motivation. Write down or voice record 1 thing you did well that day. It rewires your brain to seek momentum, not perfection.

Too many people think lack of productivity means they’re lazy, broken, or not built for success. That’s not true. Most of us are just dealing with overstimulation, poor systems, and zero recovery.

You can rebuild your focus. You can reset your rhythm. But it has to start with understanding how your brain actually works, not what some TikTok grindset guru yells at you.

A **women-only glamping summer camp** where the only thing you carry is your duffel — and maybe a secret stash of chocolate.

No men. No kids. **Just us.**

Think **safari tents** with real beds, crisp linens, and fairy lights that make bedtime feel like a sleepover you never want to end.  
No midnight hikes to a sketchy porta-potty. No waking up with a rock in your spine.

Instead:  
✨ Morning coffee delivered to your tent  
✨ Braid trains by the fire  
✨ Friendship bracelets, capture the flag, and yes — **bug juice** (but make it rosé)  
✨ Workshops, stargazing, and zero pressure to “be productive”

This isn’t self-care on a yoga mat.  
This is **self-care in motion** — laughing until your cheeks hurt, screaming during a trust fall, and remembering the girl who believed summer could last forever.

We’re bringing back **childhood camp nostalgia**, but upgraded:  
No curfews. No homesickness. Just **pure, carefree joy** with women who get it.

We both think it's because a higher up who supervised her co-op term really liked her and basically insisted on her. As this is going on she's getting stressed out that I haven't been furthering my life goals and honing my skills, I'm employed but at a minimum wage job -16 CAD an hour - and not in school atm. She's making over double my wages. Before this she worked a few odd jobs and always got minimum so this is new territory for her. She's working an IT like job that has her working close with the business side of the operation too. Months go by, we fight on and off about my work situation, school situation, my weed use and our alcohol use.

 I quite for a while which she's happy about but during this whole time our sex life is basically non existent and we basically only have sex when we're drunk. We talked about it many times during that period and she told me that me wanting it so much and being disappointed when we have sex was leading to her feeling anxious about it and not wanting to which she said sucks for her because she loves sex which I can testify to. This was kinda weird to me because the last talks we'd had about sex had her saying that she thought the way we engaged in sex didn't have enough build up as we basically just asked each other ""Hey wanna fuck?"" ""Hey can I suck your dick?"" ""Hey want me to beat up your clit?"" So after trying to get more grabby and intimate turned out to be the wrong move I obviously tried to tone that down and just let her initiate things for a while or just ask casually since what's the harm in asking right? Whoever said that should be shot. 

During this time I'm also trying to work out more, start doing shit on khan academy and trying to get interested in learning to code so I can further my prospects and relate to her. I don't get very far very fast cause I work 4 10 hour shifts a week and basically have 2 hours of free time those days after the commute to and from work so the 3 I get off a week I'm not nearly as productive as either of us wants but I try to put in the effort to better my life and our situation without losing my mind in the process but it never feels like it's enough. During this whole time she talks about work sometimes and I try to engage and ask questions -but apparently still need to ask more- and some coworkers who come up a bit more often than the others are a person whose team she was on during her co-op term -she's on a different team now- and someone from the business floor. I get nervous and go through her notes on her phone, nothing in the notes: okay cool. Then I check Claude on her phone - a language model similar to Chat GPT-  and see her talking about workplace dynamics like eye contact, what kind of messages certain perfumes send, analyzing coworkers messages to her and their emoji use.

 There were stories about her she enjoyed making her one coworker hot under the collar by leaning close when they worked together and talking about how close behind her a different worker walked behind her in the hall sometimes and pondered if he's run in to her pelvis first if she just stopped walking suddenly. This crushed my and I talked with her about it the morning after and she was understandably hurt that I'd gone through her phone and told me that she used that as a place to get validation that she was attractive and that people wanted her and was never meant for others to see and told me how embarrassed she was. I was torn between feeling betrayed and like I'd betrayed her. We almost broke up there but it's been 8 year and I love her, she says she loves me too and I believe her.  We get through that argument and try to see how things go for a while. A couple weeks later after a drunken night of fighting her phone falls on my chest out of her fingers as she falls asleep on me. I no I shouldn't even look at the screen but I do and see she's on chat GPT. 

I proceed to find out that this is where she keeps the REAL spicy and sexual stuff. she talks about looking at one of the business guys like she wants to eat him and know he knows what the look is and wonders if it's too much. Other things like wanting to tie a different coworker to a chair, slap him and then suck the soul out of him, her words not mine. There was this other one about a couple of her coworkers giving her instructions -orders more like- about how to cum and how many times and talks about how business guy has such a perfect ass and how she wants to eat it and how insanely cute he is. She never even blows me anymore let alone eats my ass anymore despite espousing to still enjoy it when I ask about her preferences. We talk about it in the morning again to much the same effect, she tries to assure me that they are just fantasies and crushes and that it's the thought of doing them that excites her and if it ever moved into the realm of reality it ruin everything. 

I ask her if she chooses me and she says she does. I take this and try to use it as a mantra against anxiety for the next couple months. She also puts a password on her phone and says if I go through her phone again it's over. about a month in I glance her password as she's putting it in that morning and debate weather I should tell her to change it or not. I decide not to. Another month goes by and one day I finally crack, I understand the consequences of the actions I'm about to take but I need to know what I dealing with, sex isn't improving, the time we spend together still feels strained. I go through with the objective of seeing what new she had to say about her coworkers and if she mentioned me at all in any positive or sexual way even once. I find a fuck literal walls of text of her asking chat gpt about what this thing her coworkers said or that means and if they know she's into them and what they are doing about it and if their girlfriends are jealous etc etc. There is also this anecdote about how her and business guy - it's almost always co-op term team guy or business guy - making like 5 seconds of eye contact at a time while talking and about how comfortable she felt with him and about how he looks at her like I look at her. 

That was the only time I found mention of me is when she was comparing to him telling chat gpt how even after 8 years of being together it's still so obvious how much I want her and how hungry I am for her and that that's the same look business guy with perfect ass gives her. Then she went on to talk about how they were leaning on a desk close to one another looking at each other while both leaning their heads on one hand just smiling at each other. She even got chat GPT to render the scene using generic art. Also there was a time she talked about she and him joking about being neighbors one day and both having nice places near the water which she then contrasted to me not being prepared to take that next step in life with her -that was the only other time I came up - there was also a lot sprinkled in entries about how much she respects the work of these two and how she hope that they can be real friends on day and not just work friends. Obviously I'm once again crushed and decide things can't go on like this so I resolve to end things the following day but then remember she's in the middle of mid terms. Her work let her take time for school since she worked so hard during her probation period.

 I decide that it would be cruel to to this during her midterms so I decide to wait till they are done. I find out that the last one is a week away for some reason and her birthday is like right after and I don't want to break up near her birthday so settle for giving her a week in between midterms to deal with things and break things off now. I pack up all her stuff and move it to the door so she can go easily and without any awkwardness and wait for her to wake up. She wakes up, I hand her a cup of coffee and explain the situation. The same fucking thing happens. I tried to break things off but seeing her like that... Seeing her try to find a way to make things work between us and seeming to genuinely want to be with me, I don't know man maybe I'm a massive pussy but I caved and asked her if there was any way we could even make this work and then we got to talking. It's been a few days since we had a good weekend and had a lot of good sex but when the week hit she went back to work and I've just been fucking terrified man. My prospects are looking up, I'm going into plumbing soon and school funds aren't going to be a problem, I've cut down heavily on weed and drink way less but I just feel like I'll never be good enough. 

It really bothers me that I never showed up in any of those notes and that she expressed not only extreme sexual interest in her co workers but emotional connections too. also just the sheer volume of content she has on these guys, I would've had to read every night for a week straight to get through it all and might not even then. Oh also I'm her first relationship, we've brought a girl into bed once a a guy another time so I'm just the only guy she's every had sex with but I am the only one she's been in a relationship with. For context I'm 6'2'' I'd say I have a 6.5 body and a 7.5-8.5 face depending on your preference. I guess the questions I'm asking are: Is this normal? Is this worth it? Are we cooked? Did I open pandora's box or is there a way to get back to a healthy happy relationship with her? Was it smart or dumb to look through the phone in the first place or should have I left that alone? What would you guys have done? what would you do in my shoes currently? I think she really loves me but is she fooling herself into staying in a relationship she doesn't want deep down?",1,1761695639.0,relationship_advice,7,0.67,False

These are the 2026 goals. I can’t promise exact dates (I’m one hobbyist dev, not an octopus), but I can promise I’ll push them as fast as reality and Android Auto allow. May the Android Auto god show mercy this year. Last year demanded more sacrifices than a head unit should legally require.

This post stays pinned in r/NonStopRadio announcements. Drop ideas that would make NSR the app that brightens your day in these very weird times. Huge thanks to the dozens of you who left 5 star reviews, and to everyone brave enough to try a new radio app instead of the usual suspects.

My wish for the year: may NSR be with you in your joys, your sorrows, your lonely nights, your gatherings, and in the moments you’ll remember for the rest of your life, *your only friend through* *~~teenage~~* *tune-age nights.*

**2026 roadmap (things I’ll do or at least wrestle into submission)**

1. **Export/Import Favorites** so you can move favorite stations across devices.
2. **Play Screen UI fix** so transport controls (play/pause, etc.) stop jumping around.
3. **No more “Unknown”** your dashboard deserves a name so it gets the station’s.
4. **Instant metadata purge** on station change to avoid stale or incorrect info.
5. **Android Auto no metadata freeze fix** so the screen doesn’t get stuck.
6. **Better local files** plus search by artist, genre, and more.
7. **More Favorite Lists** for radio and local music, playable in Android Auto.
8. **Podcast downloads** because tunnels and flights exist.
9. **Play downloaded podcasts in Android Auto.**
10. **Double tap save fix** so it stores song and artist, not just title.
11. **Smarter metadata parsing** for stations that add extra words around the track title. Clean it up as best as possible.
12. **Sleep timer.** Because sometimes sleep wins.

1oipi4n,https://i.redd.it/8pphzruowxxf1.png,Dressing with Panache: The Ultimate Guide to Men’s Overcoats and Jackets – La Mode Men's,"# Introduction

When the temperatures drop, style doesn’t have to go into hibernation. Men’s overcoats and jackets are far more than functional garments—they’re expressions of confidence, taste, and personality. At **La Mode Men's**, we believe outerwear is the finishing touch that defines a man’s presence. Whether you’re stepping into a boardroom, strolling down city streets, or venturing into the countryside, the right coat or jacket enhances your look and keeps you comfortable in every season.

In this comprehensive guide, we’ll explore the world of men’s overcoats and jackets—diving into their origins, key styles, materials, fit tips, and the art of styling them for every occasion. You’ll learn how to choose the perfect piece that reflects your individuality and elevates your wardrobe with timeless sophistication.

# A Brief History of Men’s Overcoats and Jackets

# From Utility to Sophistication

The story of men’s overcoats and jackets begins centuries ago, when these garments were designed primarily for warmth and protection. In the 17th and 18th centuries, thick woolen coats were essential for soldiers and sailors braving harsh conditions. Over time, practicality merged with elegance as tailors refined silhouettes and materials, giving birth to the modern overcoat—a garment that combined function and form.

# Icons Who Defined Outerwear Style

From Winston Churchill’s classic trench coat to Steve McQueen’s effortlessly cool leather jacket, cultural icons have long influenced men’s outerwear trends. The trench coat became synonymous with power and poise, while the bomber jacket symbolized rebellion and youth. These timeless pieces still dominate men’s fashion, proving that great design transcends generations.

# Exploring the Types of Men’s Overcoats and Jackets

The variety of men’s outerwear today is vast—each style offering a unique personality and purpose. Understanding their differences helps you build a versatile collection suited for any occasion.

# 1. Classic Trench Coats

Few garments carry as much history and versatility as the trench coat. Originally developed for British officers during World War I, its waterproof fabric, belted waist, and structured silhouette make it ideal for rainy days and city life. Modern trench coats—often in beige, navy, or black—pair effortlessly with suits or casual attire. They project refinement while providing protection against unpredictable weather.

# 2. Timeless Peacoats

The peacoat, a double-breasted wool coat with broad lapels, has naval roots dating back to European sailors. Its structured form and durable construction make it a favorite for both smart and relaxed ensembles. A navy peacoat over a turtleneck and chinos evokes polished masculinity, making it a must-have in every man’s wardrobe.

# 3. Modern Parkas

Parkas are the kings of practicality. Designed for Arctic explorers, today’s parkas combine insulation with style. Featuring down or synthetic fills, fur-lined hoods, and water-resistant shells, they are perfect for winter commutes or outdoor adventures. Neutral tones like olive, gray, or black blend seamlessly into modern wardrobes, offering warmth without sacrificing style.

# 4. Stylish Bomber Jackets

Originally crafted for military pilots, bomber jackets have become icons of casual fashion. Characterized by ribbed cuffs, a zip front, and a waist-length cut, bombers are ideal for transitional weather. Whether in leather for a rugged edge or nylon for streetwear appeal, they bring energy and personality to any outfit.

# 5. Elegant Topcoats

Topcoats are the epitome of formal outerwear. Sleek and lightweight compared to overcoats, they’re designed to drape gracefully over suits or dress ensembles. A camel or charcoal topcoat instantly adds authority and sophistication, ideal for business meetings, formal events, or evening outings.

# Materials That Define Quality

The fabric of your outerwear determines not only how it feels but also how it performs. At **La Mode Men's**, we emphasize materials that offer comfort, longevity, and timeless appeal.

# Wool: The Classic Choice

Wool remains the most popular choice for overcoats and peacoats due to its warmth, structure, and durability. Variants like cashmere and merino wool offer luxurious softness and superior insulation. A well-tailored wool coat can last for years with proper care, maintaining its shape and sheen season after season.

# Leather: The Statement Maker

Leather jackets are the cornerstone of rugged masculinity. Whether smooth lambskin or textured cowhide, leather exudes confidence and edge. It molds to your body over time, becoming uniquely yours. Pair it with jeans and boots for a casual look or over a turtleneck for an elevated ensemble.

# Technical Fabrics: Modern Innovation

Contemporary materials such as Gore-Tex, Thinsulate, and recycled nylon are revolutionizing outerwear design. These fabrics offer lightweight warmth, water resistance, and breathability—perfect for active lifestyles. They allow you to stay stylish and dry during urban commutes or outdoor excursions.

# Mastering the Perfect Fit

The best coat or jacket not only looks good—it *feels* right. Fit is the cornerstone of style, ensuring comfort, mobility, and confidence.

# Getting the Size Right

An overcoat should fit comfortably over a suit or sweater without appearing bulky. Shoulders should align naturally, and sleeves should end just past the wrist. For jackets, aim for a tailored fit that flatters your frame while allowing free movement.

# Layering Like a Pro

Layering adds dimension and functionality. During colder months, pair your overcoat with a wool blazer, knit sweater, or turtleneck. Ensure that each layer complements the next in color and texture. The key is balance—never too tight, never too loose.

# Styling Your Overcoats and Jackets

Outerwear is an opportunity to showcase your versatility and taste. The right styling transforms simple garments into sophisticated statements.

# 1. Formal Elegance

For business or evening wear, opt for a **topcoat or trench coat** in dark, neutral colors such as navy, black, or camel. Pair it with a tailored suit, polished leather shoes, and a La Mode Men's tie for an impeccable finish. Add a silk scarf for extra refinement.

# 2. Casual Chic

Casual doesn’t mean careless. A **bomber jacket** over a crisp dress shirt and slim-fit jeans creates an effortlessly modern look. For weekends, choose a **parka or peacoat** with chinos and boots—perfect for city strolls or coffee dates.

# 3. Seasonal Versatility

Spring and fall call for lightweight layers—think cotton trench coats or suede jackets. Winter demands insulation, so rely on wool or down-filled parkas. Adapt your wardrobe to the climate while maintaining your personal flair.

# Care and Maintenance Tips

Your overcoat or jacket is an investment in style. Proper care ensures it remains in excellent condition for years.

# Cleaning

* **Wool and cashmere coats** should be dry-cleaned once or twice a season.
* **Leather jackets** benefit from specialized cleaning and conditioning to prevent cracking.
* **Technical fabrics** can often be machine-washed, but always follow care labels.

# Storage

Hang your coats on wide, sturdy hangers to preserve their shape. Store them in breathable garment bags during the off-season, away from direct sunlight or moisture. For leather, apply conditioner annually to maintain suppleness.

# Building a Versatile Outerwear Collection

Creating a well-rounded outerwear wardrobe doesn’t require dozens of pieces—just thoughtful choices that fit your lifestyle.

1. **The Everyday Essential:** A neutral wool overcoat for both professional and social occasions.
2. **The Weekend Favorite:** A leather or bomber jacket for laid-back confidence.
3. **The Winter Defender:** A down-filled parka for extreme cold.
4. **The Transitional Piece:** A lightweight trench for rainy days and spring outings.

With these four staples, you’ll be prepared for any weather or event while maintaining an impeccable sense of style.

# Why Choose La Mode Men's

I have always been a fan of frying chicken, pork chops and similar in a skillet. I stopped enjoying this meal because of everything about it. Teflon non-stick skillet, vegetable oil while frying etc. 

Anyway the first thing I was hoping to do is to stop using the vegetable oil. I have recently began to filter bacon grease through a coffee filter and keep the remaining grease in the refrigerator. I have thought about trying to use this grease to fry chicken. However, I am scared how it will turn out. Secondly, I use whatever is left in the pan to make gravy. So I am concerned it is just not going to work out. 

Before this gets to be too a flood do you guys think the bacon grease could be worth trying? Also what alternatives can I use to fry chicken in a skillet and get the closest results to the vegetable oil? Keeping in mind I am usually making gravy afterwards? I also bought some peanut oil earlier this year but also read it is a seed oil and not much better than regular vegetable oil. 

Finally I would like to hear some alternatives for a good pan to fry bacon, eggs, chicken, pork chops, etc in. From my research it looks like the best viable pan is learning to use and season a nice cast iron skillet. However, first thing is first, I wish to get rid of the seed oil. I would be grateful for any advice or tips anyone here can give me.

- [if you get an RPG hit, a squad mate asks...] ""Since when did you become an expert in rocket-propulsion kinetic-physics""...""last night""

- ""this....this is like some kind of battlefield 6"" 

- ""we have an army""....then a witty retort like ""we have a tank.""

- ""my name is John Battlefield"" then someone says like ""oh we're using our soldier names...my name is soldier-man""

- if you run away from the enemy you say something like ""nope! Not before my coffee"" 😆😆😆😆

“Unsettling Differences” by Blue Smock Nancy plays

OMG!! IT'S KEVIN OWENS!! Kevin Owens in Universal Studios for the first time since 2015. “HOLY SHIT” chants intensifies as the crowd is so excited to see The Prizefighter back in Winter Park, FL

*Kevin Owens vs. Eric Young*

The match begins with a wild brawl. Young pummels Owens with clubbing forearms, but Owens shoves him off and decks him with a thunderous right hand. The two exchange heavy shots, fists flying, the referee shouting to maintain order. Owens backs Young into the corner and unloads with rapid-fire chops to the chest — CRACK! CRACK! CRACK! — each one louder than the last. The crowd eats it up, chanting “Holy Shit!”

Owens whips Young across the ring, charges in, and crushes him with a running clothesline followed by a cannonball! Young rolls out to the floor to regroup, clutching his ribs, but Owens wastes no time — he bounces off the ropes and dives through the ropes with a suicide dive! The impact sends both men crashing into the barricade! The crowd explodes again as Owens roars, slapping his chest and yelling, “This is MY ring now!”

Owens drags Young up by the beard and slams him face-first into the apron, rolling him back inside. He follows with a senton for a quick cover — 1… 2… kickout! Young retreats to the corner, trying to create distance, but Owens is relentless, stomping him down and laying in forearm after forearm.

Desperate, Young catches Owens with a low dropkick to the knee, sending the big man stumbling. He capitalizes with a neckbreaker, using the ropes for momentum. Owens sits up groggy, and Young rushes in with a sliding forearm smash to the jaw. Cover — 1… 2… Owens powers out!

Young starts yelling at the crowd, screaming, “You cheer for HIM?! He doesn’t belong here!” He grabs Owens by the head and slaps him hard across the face. Owens glares up at him, rage flashing in his eyes. Young backs off for a moment, realizing the mistake — but he doubles down with another slap. Owens explodes to his feet, throwing a headbutt that rocks Young backward, then a series of blistering knife-edge chops.

Young staggers into the ropes, rebounds, and hits a flying forearm smash! Owens stumbles, but Young pulls him in for a pile driver attempt — Owens blocks it, powering Young up into an Alabama Slam! The crowd pops hard. Owens stumbles into the corner, trying to shake off the pain as Young writhes on the mat.

Young crawls to the ropes, clutching his neck. Owens charges in — Young counters with a back elbow, then climbs to the top rope, looking for his trademark Elbow Drop… but Owens rises fast, catching him with a leaping uppercut to the jaw!

Owens climbs up after him, landing heavy forearms to the side of the head. Young fights back, biting Owens’ forehead to break free, and shoves him down to the mat. Owens hits the canvas hard, Young steadies himself, and dives off with the elbow drop! But Owens rolls out of the way! Young crashes hard, clutching his ribs!

Owens senses the opening and hits the ropes — Running Senton! He covers — 1… 2… kickout! The crowd claps along, urging Owens to finish it. He hauls Young up, whips him off the ropes — POP-UP POWERBOMB! — NO! Young counters mid-air into a hurricanrana, sending Owens crashing to the corner!

Young scrambles up, sets for a Piledriver again, yelling “You don’t belong in TNA!” — but Owens counters, back body dropping Young over his shoulder. Young pops up, running wild with a lariat — Owens ducks, hooks him from behind — Backdrop Driver! Owens keeps hold of the wrist, pulling Young back in and nailing a short-arm lariat that nearly turns him inside out!

The fans are on their feet. Owens wipes his mouth, snarling, then yells: “TIME TO FIGHT!” He drags Young up by the hair and delivers a superkick to the jaw, staggering the veteran backward into the ropes. As Young rebounds, Owens scoops him — POP-UP POWERBOMB CONNECTS!

Owens immediately hooks the leg —
1… 2… 3!

*Kevin Owens def. Eric Young (8:33)*

In his first ever match ever in Total Nonstop Action, Kevin Owens got a win and he beat a veteran in Eric Young.

***Build to Final Resolution 2025***

Kevin Owens shows up on the Impact after Turning Point to explain why he came to TNA when ERIC YOUNG ambushes him from behind on the ramp with a Steel Chair. Eric sends Owens in the ring and hits a PILEDRIVER on Owens’ surgically repaired neck. A stretcher comes out for Owens but Owens powers through and walks away on his own two feet.

The next few weeks, Director of Authority,  Santino Marella tells Owens to stay away from TNA the next few weeks to recover because he is nowhere near cleared. 2 weeks before Final Resolution and against Santino’s orders, Kevin shows up and immediately attacks Eric Young, resulting in a brawl. After the brawl, Owens goes into Santino's office and asks for a rematch with Young and he wants it to be MONSTER'S BALL!!! Santino, regretfully, makes the match

***TNA Final Resolution 2025 | El Paso, TX | (12/5/25)***

*Monsters Ball - Kevin Owens vs. Eric Young*

They charge at each other instantly, throwing wild punches. The crowd roars with every connection. Owens wins the exchange, forcing Young into the corner and unloading with lefts and rights, punctuated by a vicious chop that echoes across the arena. Owens bounces off the opposite ropes for a cannonball—Young dives out of the ring just in time!

Owens wastes no moment, sliding out after him, only for Young to whip him shoulder-first into the steel steps! Owens grits his teeth, clutching his arm, and Young grins with sadistic delight. He lifts the apron skirt and starts tossing weapons into the ring — steel chairs, a trash can, a kendo stick, and finally… a bag of thumbtacks. The crowd gasps as he shakes them, sprinkling some over the mat.

Young turns around and eats a clothesline from Owens! The impact sends him tumbling into the barricade. Owens grabs a kendo stick and cracks it across Young’s spine — once, twice, three times! Splinters fly. He rolls Young back inside and follows with a Senton splash onto the tacks — but it misses! Young moves at the last second, and Owens crashes back-first into a small handful of tacks! He arches his back in pain, tacks embedded in his skin, while Young cackles.

Young takes over, slamming Owens’ head into the turnbuckle repeatedly. He wedges a chair between the ropes, then whips Owens into it headfirst! Owens slumps to the mat, dazed. Young takes a moment to taunt the crowd, shouting, “You wanted your hero? This is your hero bleeding for you!”

He pulls Owens up by the beard, hooks him in, and drops him with a Piledriver! The crowd gasps! Young crawls into the cover — 1… 2… OWENS KICKS OUT! The roof nearly blows off the Impact Zone! The camera zooms in on Young’s face, twisted in disbelief. He screams in frustration, pounding the mat, before rolling outside to grab a table.

Young sets the table up in the corner, slides back in, and drags Owens toward it. He tries for another Piledriver — but Owens blocks it, back body dropping Young right through the table! The crash sends splinters flying, and the crowd chants “TNA! TNA!” Owens drops to a knee, breathing heavily, blood running from a cut on his arm.

He slowly rises, picks up the trash can, and smashes it over Young’s back. He hits another, then throws the can down, bounces off the ropes, and cannonballs Young into the wreckage! Owens covers — 1… 2… kickout!

Owens rolls outside and pulls out something new — a ladder. The crowd pops huge. He slides it into the ring, but Young meets him with a baseball slide, sending the ladder right into Owens’ ribs! Young follows with a suicide dive, driving both men into the barricade again.

Both men are battered, crawling. Young’s eyes are wild as he drags Owens to the announce table. He yells at the commentators to move, clears the table, and hooks Owens for another Piledriver. Owens fights back, hammering Young with elbows to the ribs, then lifts him into the air and powerbombs him onto the announce table! The table doesn’t break, the impact just echoes — a sickening THUD!

Owens shouts, “You wanted a fight, Eric? YOU GOT ONE!” He hoists Young again and slams him through the table on the second try — it shatters, and the crowd erupts in a “Holy sh*t!” chant. Owens, exhausted, drags Young’s limp body back toward the ring.

Inside, Owens sets the ladder upright near the corner. He climbs halfway up and Frog Splashes off the ladder, crushing Young through the trash can below! The crowd counts along — 1… 2… Young somehow kicks out!

Owens can’t believe it. He stumbles to his feet, grabbing the bag of tacks. He spreads them across the center of the ring, the silver glinting under the lights. He grabs Young, but the veteran rakes his eyes and bites Owens’ forehead to break free. Young hooks Owens’ arm, screaming “This is MY company!” — PILEDRIVER ON THE TACKS! The fans gasp, some covering their mouths. Owens is motionless for a moment.

Young covers, smirking — 1… 2… OWENS KICKS OUT AGAIN! The arena erupts!

Young’s jaw drops, his composure shattering. He grabs a steel chair, smashing it into Owens’ back repeatedly, each shot louder than the last. He goes for one more, swinging wild — Owens catches it!

Owens yanks the chair away and blasts Young with it across the skull! Young collapses. Owens throws the chair aside, breathing hard, then grabs Young by the head, shouting “You never should’ve messed with me!” He hooks him for the Package Piledriver, but his knees buckle — he’s too exhausted. Young senses the hesitation, elbows free, and runs for a lariat — Owens ducks!

Superkick! Young spins around — another Superkick! Owens roars, bouncing off the ropes — Pop-up Powerbomb! The crowd loses it! Owens, still feeding on adrenaline, pulls Young’s limp body up, hooks the arms deep, lifts — PACKAGE PILEDRIVER ON THE TACKS!

The crowd explodes into a frenzy! Owens hooks the leg —
1… 2… 3!

***Build to Genesis 2026***

Kevin Owens shows up on the Impact after Final Resolution. Bloodied, bruised, and beaten. But more importantly, a winner. He says the reason why he came to TNA is because he's been a part of almost every wrestling company in the world. WWE, ROH, PWG, ect and the one place he's never been, is TNA. And not only does he just want to be in TNA, he wants to be the World Champion in TNA. Out comes Mike Santana. He says if he wants a title shot all he has to do is ask because he is a fighting champion. Then Mustafa Ali comes out. He says it is unfair for KO to get a World Title shot after only being in the company for a cup of coffee. He also says he deserves a title shot because he's beaten Santana before and he can do it again. Finally out comes Santino, he makes a number one contenders match between Owens and Ali in the main event of Impact.

***TNA Genesis 2026 | Dallas, TX | (1/18/25)***

*Kevin Owens vs. Mike Santana(c) - TNA World Heavyweight Championship*

Owens and Santana circle. The tension’s palpable. They lock up — collar and elbow — both men straining for leverage. Owens powers Santana into the ropes, gives a clean break, and taps his chest. Respect. Santana smirks and returns the gesture.

They go again, this time Santana transitions into a side headlock, wrenching it tight. Owens shoves him off, Santana rebounds — shoulder tackle, and Owens doesn’t move. Santana tries again — same result. The fans start a “This is awesome!” chant already. Third time, Santana hits the ropes — Owens drops down, pops up, leapfrog — Santana charges again — Owens catches him with a wicked back elbow!

Owens follows with a snap senton, covers — 1, 2, kickout. He pulls Santana up and whips him into the corner, charging for a Cannonball — Santana slips out just in time and catches Owens with a running enzuigiri! The crowd gasps. Santana hops up to the second rope and nails a springboard crossbody, hooking the leg — 1, 2, Owens powers out.

They stand, staring each other down as the crowd claps and cheers the evenly matched start. Santana nods, mouthing “Alright then.” Owens grins and gestures, “Come on.”

They go into a blistering exchange — forearm from Santana, one from Owens, back and forth, faster and harder until Santana ducks one, spins around, and chops Owens across the chest! Owens fires back with a chop of his own, even louder. They trade chops until both men’s chests are beet red.

Santana breaks the rhythm with a rolling cutter! He covers — 1, 2, kickout! Santana quickly transitions, hooking Owens for a Falcon Arrow, but Owens blocks, lifts Santana instead, and hits a Fisherman’s Buster! Both men crash hard and stay down. The referee starts a count as the fans chant, “This is wrestling!”

Owens crawls over first, draping an arm — 1… 2… Santana kicks out!

Owens pulls himself up using the ropes, sweat dripping, and climbs to the middle rope. He looks down, measuring Santana, and drops a senton — but Santana gets the knees up! Owens rolls in agony as Santana pops up, sprints off the ropes, and hits a spinning lariat! He covers — 1… 2… Owens kicks out again!

Santana rises, frustrated but focused. He signals for the Street Sweeper Kick, bouncing off the ropes — Owens dodges and Superkicks Santana square in the jaw! The crowd erupts! Owens lifts Santana, whips him off the ropes, and Pop-up Powerbomb! The ring shakes! Owens covers — 1… 2… Santana kicks out at the last second!

Owens drags Santana to the corner and sets him up for another Cannonball. This time, he connects! The crowd cheers wildly. Owens doesn’t go for the pin — instead, he climbs to the top rope, signaling for the Moonsault. He leaps — Santana rolls away! Owens crashes chest-first into the mat!

Santana takes advantage, dragging Owens up and hitting a Death Valley Driver! He covers — 1… 2… NO! Owens just gets the shoulder up. Santana yells in frustration, pounding the mat. He grabs Owens again and tries for another — Owens counters mid-motion into a DDT! Both men are down!

They slowly rise, leaning into each other for balance. Santana swings — Owens blocks — headbutt! Another! Santana stumbles, dazed, and Owens roars before hitting another Superkick! He scoops Santana onto his shoulders for a Powerbomb onto the apron— but Santana wriggles free, landing behind him, and German Suplexes Owens onto the ring apron! The crowd gasps!

Both men collapse on the outside, the referee’s count reaching 5… then 6… Owens drags himself up by the barricade, slides back in at 8. Santana follows, slower, clutching his back.

Santana tries to go for the kill, hoisting Owens up — but Owens bites down, elbows out, then plants Santana with a Stunner! The building explodes! Owens covers — 1… 2… Santana kicks out again!

Owens signals for one more Pop-up Powerbomb. He drags Santana up, whips him — but Santana leapfrogs over him! Owens turns around and eats a jumping knee strike! Santana follows instantly with a lariat that flips Owens inside out! The champion falls into the cover — 1… 2… Owens kicks out!

Santana slaps the mat, adrenaline coursing. He looks out at the crowd, eyes burning. The fans chant “Let’s go Santana!” / “Fight Owens Fight!” back and forth. He grabs Owens’ wrist, drags him up slowly, and yells in his face — “Stay down!”

Owens responds with a headbutt! Santana fires back with a forearm! Owens stumbles, rebounds off the ropes, Superkick! Santana staggers, but on pure instinct, runs the ropes and hits a spinning forearm smash! Both men drop to their knees, eyes glassy, exchanging wild, exhausted strikes from the mat up to their feet again.

Then Santana suddenly hooks Owens — lifts — Rolling Cutter into a Brainbuster! The crowd gasps as Owens goes limp. Santana isn’t done — he pulls Owens back up, roars, and hits the SPIN THE BLOCK flush!!

Owens crumples. Santana covers —
1… 2… 3!

In reality, it really wasn't. There is no anti gravity, no artificial gravity, no momentum stabilizers, or acceleration buffers. No particle shields, or force fields. No nanotechnology. Physics is a cold hard bitch. We did however get faster then light travel of a kind, but it as more.. the ship wasn't moving faster then light, but we did get ""Space"" to move faster then light. We finally did get a form of the Alcubierre drive. It required power. So much power. After fusion become the primary power source of earth, and superconductors were finally developed with the help of AI, we managed to get FTL travel. It required long ships. Very long spaceships. The longer they are, the more ""space"" they can move, but more materials where needed, so they were often only 50-100 meters wide at their thickest. The causality effect was effectively resolved before it was even a problem, as inside the long thin spacetime bubble, communications to the outside universe was impossible, and the drive could not be steered or collapsed once started until the destination was reached. From the crew’s perspective, it feels like they’re going FTL, and from physics’ perspective, no information actually outruns light in a way that can be used to build a paradox. Observers in different frames might disagree on the ordering of “departure vs arrival,” but they weren't able to use that to send messages backwards, because the only message is the ship itself and could not be redirected to “exploit” the frame difference. 

Nicknamed NeedleShips, as the fastest ones were over 100 kilometres long but with only a diameter of 50 odd meters, they did allow us to get into space. With the development of infinite length carbon nanotube manufacturing, space tethers were finally common place, and getting into low earth orbit was a common affair, and, finally, the needleships allowed us to reach intersolar space.  The biggest problem came with us. Human beings had not evolved for space. Microgravity was brutal, and radiation was always a problem. That, and needleships needed to be initially fast before engaging their drive, so interstellar dust and micrometeorites impacting the ships at high speed, with no known way to stop them, the needleships needed ablative ice caps that needed to be rebuilt after every few hundred hours of travel, or even more in bad areas of space.  To help with the bone mass loss and the problems of moving around in microgravity, the ship rotated around its long axis at around 4rpm. It wasn't earth like gravity, as the coriolis effect was still pretty stong, but it was enough to massively reduce the effects of microgravity. You could always tell when someone had spent too long on a needleship, they moved slowly on a planet, turned their heads so cautiously, and often fell over when changing direction, and often spent weeks or even months on anti-nausea medication. Called spin-lag, a lot of long time spacers could never return to a normal planet's gravity.  

Oxygen, water and food however was solved fairly easily. With genetically engineered algae tanks, oxygen and water filtration/reclamation was a faily self sufficient process, but the food.. it wasn't great. Protein paste by itself was fairly bland, and flavourings and spices that couldn't be made on ship needing to be purchased, the industry around flavours, spices, pure mechanical re-processing, and essential vitamins and minerals boomed. What could be made with the base protein was amazingly varied. Carbohydrates, also essential, was now an easy problem to solve, and vats of special algea and bacteria providing what our human bodies required. 

Radiation continued to be the major issue for humans however. Cell degradation causing cancers and illnesses, and microgravity causing bone loss, partially resolved with constant exercise, and the long axis spin, were still the number one issue for long space flights. The crew of these needleships had expiration dates. Unless they willingly continued on their careers, most crew had a maximum in ship serving time of 5 years, and AI did a lot of the hard work, the less crew to be exposed to the dangers of space travel the better, with passengers passports counting the hours in space, very few people ever had more then 200-300 hours in space apart from crew. 

It was no high tech science utopia. 

However, the radiation issue was solved ironicly, from a human caused radiation disaster. 

Scientists had discovered bacteria and fungi around the disaster area known as Chernobyl where able to feed of radiation. Specifically beta and gamma. The two real killers of humans in space. 

Somehow, through a quirk of mutation or evolution, perhaps both, scientists were able to create mats and panels of hybrid lifeforms able to actually shield humans from spaceborne radiation. It was not perfect, but even a simple reduction of 50 percent greatly reduced the occurances of cancer in spacefaring humans. In what felt like a day, radiation blocking materials were available. The panels were alive, they needed oxygen, and moisture, but the living radiation shields changed the way we travelled space. Needleships turned into organic bastions against radiation, and we reached further into space yet again. Able to cross distances at around 100 times the speed of light, humans started a diaspora, spreading throughout our little corner of the galaxy.  And in a stroke of luck, a needleship returned to earth with another mutation in their radiation shielding that was able to also feed on cosmic rays, and with the mutation easily copied, ""innoculation"" of all needleships against cosmic rays was basically as simple as a bottle of a genetically engineered virus dumped into the irrigation systems of the mats. 

A decade later, after genetic engineering, advanced metamaterial research, and perhaps, good old dumb luck, a researcher had discovered a way to make a substrate out of these radiation blocking materials that didn't require the living hosts of bacteria and fungi. The energy of radiation was no longer used as a food for these lifeforms, but instead, the radiation was converted into energy in the form of light. Though incredibly expensive, the critical human occupying areas of needleships became glowing sanctuaries. Some engineer, with a manufactured vat grown coffee analog in his system thought to himself one day. ""It's so bright in here, will a solar panel capture this light?""

And they did. These expensive substrates suddenly became power sources as well, with integrated inch thick panels, standardised in shape and form, becoming radiation shields and power sources all in one. The technology around capturing the broadband light and converted energy from these complicated radiation sucking molecules into electricity boomed, and suddenly, it was possible to use radiation from planets far from a solar systems sun to generate power. Arrays of these panels were used to both protect human beings and generate power with stations around gas giants, with what used to be the extremely dangerous occupation of skimming gas giants for fusion fuel becoming much safer, and the moons inside the radiation bands of these planets becoming settled, with shielding and power all due to the discovery of radiation eating lifeforms, from a human disaster deep in earth's past. 

Once again, humanity leaped forward in its occupation of space. In the face of hard physical limits, and medical technology already much more advanced in the field of anti-cancer, with the side effect of increasing human lifetimes, we spread. With the average human lifespan now reaching 150, barring physical accidents and trauma (humans still are not immune to the vacuum of space, or a micro-meteorite puncturing a spacesuit), the future of mankind wasn't the magic force fields and handwaving of science fiction novels, but pure, hard, science. Hard won.  

The human spirit, in the face of adversity, always fought on, always battled, solving problems one day at a time.


Excerpt from Needleship Crew Orientation Handbook, paraphrased by a grizzled engineer, with smooth white patches of scar tissue on his face and hands from his body automatically rejecting cancers because of the anti-cancer medication coursing through his body. 

""The Alcubierre drive is not a thruster, and it is not a maneuvering system. Once engaged, the bubble of warped space is sealed. Nothing may enter or leave until collapse, and no course corrections are possible. To outside observers, a Needleship accelerates on fusion ion thrust, then vanishes at its point of departure and reappears at its destination.

This limitation is not an inconvenience but a safeguard. If signals could cross the bubble, or if the bubble could be steered while in motion, contradictions in cause and effect would arise. Physicists proved long ago that such paradoxes would destroy any consistent chronology. The ship itself becomes the only message, and that message can only be delivered forward in time. We don't know what would happen if this was possible, and we do NOT want to find out. 

For this reason, navigation is completed before the drive is spooled. Once the bubble forms, the crew enter silence and darkness, their universe consists entirely of the bubble. No stars, no light shows, just darkness. No messages pass outward, and no signals can be received. Only when the warp collapses does communication resume. This rule is universal across all Needleships, enforced by both physics and design.

Cadets often ask why this restriction cannot be overcome. The answer is simple. If it could, time itself would lose order. Better that we cross the stars with silence, than risk tearing apart the story of our own lives, or even worse, cause problems with reality itself. We don't know how the universe would resolve these tears, even if it's possible, and it keeps many spacers awake at night.",8,1761694607.0,worldbuilding,16,0.9,False

[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ntmf7e/i_have_memory_loss_and_my_sleep_paralysis_demon/), [part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1o7rudb/i_have_memory_loss_and_my_sleep_paralysis_demon/).



Morning came, so did another call.  I jittered at the kitchen table as I waited for Mom to pick up.  With a click, my Mom’s voice eased some of my anxiety, “Hello, sweetie, so nice of you to call so soon!”

My heart fell into my chest at the thought of ruining her joy with the questions to come.  With a sigh, I responded, “Hi! Yes, well, I hate to call for depressing reasons, but I have more…um… questions about Dan…if you don’t mind?”

A crippling pause on the line.  “Of course, honey,” She finally replied, “I’m sure it's awful having forgotten things about your sweet little brother… How can I help?”

“Well, I remembered some of his worst episodes of night terrors, but the actual details of them are still a blur.  I was hoping you would remember. Do you recall what it was he would see during those, uh, occurrences?”  

A contemplative breath was taken, “Well,”  She began, “Sometimes, it would just be shadows that scared him.  You know, figures in the corner, or something peeking from out of the closet.  But his worst one was something that got right up to him.”  A restraining sigh paused her story before continuing, “Oh, I remember he was really rattled by that one.  He was shaking in my arms the whole night, crying about a giant with eyes all over him.  That was the worst one…the worst one.  He only had that particular nightmare about four times, though, before the accident…”

I digested that statement, cold sweat coating my palms, “Were all pretty close to when the accident happened?”

Another thoughtful pause, “Yes, I believe all four episodes happened about a month before the accident.  Why do you want to know all this?  Are you still getting awful sleep?”

Concern dripped through the phone.  I tried to stamp it out, “No, no, I have been doing better.  I was just curious if this was all, like, a genetic thing or something me and Dan maybe watched when we were little and stuck with us.  Like a scary movie monster or something.  Just jumpstarting my memories since they are still pretty foggy lately.”  Not a total lie, I was hoping for some easy explanation for all this.  

With notable relief in her voice, Mom replied, “Ok, as long as you're sleeping, and no, I don’t remember you two watching a movie that would scar you like that! Unless you snuck downstairs one night WITH Dan.”  

I smiled as memories of doing just that reemerged.  Warm, happy memories of staying up late into the night with Dan during summer vacation, watching all sorts of shit we definitely were too young to see.  But still, no recollection of a horror movie traumatizing us.  The worst-case scenario remained prominent.  I ended the call with pleasantries to further ease the concern I caused Mom, before frantically searching online for any way to snap out of sleep paralysis by force.  Ice coursed through my blood as I watched the day burn away, the daunting, inevitable blotching my mind.   

A new fear arose from my conversation, fuel to the already unstable fire.  The number of episodes Dan had before he died.  Four, four times he saw this thing.  And then, the accident.  Something had latched onto his brain, something that was much more patient with him.  I couldn’t believe it was a coincidence, no matter how much I tried.  

Three times I had already seen it.  What would happen after a fourth visit?  The implications were suffocating me.  Sunset was approaching.  Another pot of coffee brewed as I stared out my window at the dimming daylight.  The stockpile of existential horrors lay like bloated corpses on my mind.  I would remain awake, no matter my exhaustion, that much I knew.  I planned out my night of activities to avoid any leisure that could lead to a mishap like last time—puzzles, video games, anything that required my stimulated attention.  Of course, these were to be supplements when searching for an answer to my predicament grew too frustrating.  

All lights remained on, TV blaring in the background, as I tried to concoct any ideas on how to shake this nightmare off my trail.  What could I do if I couldnt move or speak?  After a lengthy internal spiral, I came to the simple conclusion that was staring me in the face the whole time.  I would not sleep ever again.  

It was deep into the early morning when this revelation occurred.  A digital clock glowed its haunting red hue onto my nightstand; the time was 3:21 AM.  Another cup of coffee to celebrate my enlightenment was in order.  With a flourish, I giddily poured the stale drink into my stained mug.  Whether it was the lack of sleep mixed with copious amounts of caffeine or the strain of mental turmoil finally breaking me, I will never know.  All I knew was that I was shaking with tremors of laughter on my couch upon this plan’s discovery.  The relief fueled this avalanche of chaotic joy.  The rest of the night, like a coked-up child, I pointed and laughed at whatever mindless sitcom happened to be playing on the TV.  Cup after cup of coffee, I quaked with giggles through the night; the jitters were part of the fun, I suppose.  

Then the sun began to rise, which was when I took a long, hard look at myself.  Exhaustion was setting in, along with the embarrassment of my behavior.  Another pot brewed on the kitchen counter as I stared at my phone.  The word, *Monday*, was staring at me.  I had two more days off to ‘enjoy’ before I returned to a job I had little to no recollection of.  With a plan of such childish proportions that, if I followed through with it, it would debilitate any capacity I had to re-learn my job’s role.  

Another stressor.  Another life-threatening responsibility I had little understanding of clawed its way onto the pile of dread in the pit of my stomach.  Nevertheless, I would go through with my plan.  I was dead-set on never sleeping again.  Simple as that.  I knew I would need something much stronger than coffee at some point, but I would cross that bridge when I got there.  

All day, I exerted as little energy as possible, all while trying to remain somewhat active to ensure a drowsy fit would not sabotage me.  Walks, gaming, puzzles, calling what friends and family I could recall.  I gave my Mom a break from me; I had already upset her twice.  With that, another day came and went.  The moon mocked me through my open window as I stared at the horizon.  

I lasted the next day, and then the next.  Seventy-two hours of no sleep does things to the body.  I could barely stand up without almost blacking out.  My body felt both like a corpse my soul was chained to, and a third-person out-of-body observer of my own self.  I couldn’t leave the house; my vision was a wavy blur of unfocused stimuli.  No way I could drive.  Work was tomorrow.  Hoping for the best, I sifted through my contacts, hoping to find someone clearly labeled “boss”.  

Thank God, I found him, *Jim (boss man)*, was buried in my contacts.  With a sobering sigh, I called.  As soon as he answered, and after we got through the courtesy talk of “how are you doing?” and “feeling rested, I hope”, I delved into the script I had lucidly concocted in my sleep-deprived soup brain.  “Yeah, so uh,” I began, “I hate to say but I am still pretty rough right now and even just remembering where I sleep has been an issue,” I embellished my condition for a few more lines, before ending with the question I was obviously building up to, “Would it possible to get the next two days for me as well? I think having the long weekend will be enough for me to really gather myself.”

A long pause rattled any confidence I had in my rushed script.  After a sigh I definitely was not supposed to hear, Jim concluded the call with, “Yeah, yeah, we can handle things here while you're out.  Take the time you need.  Just be sure you are ready to go on Monday, first thing.”  

Thanking him, before I could end the call, he cut me off, saying, “By the way, get some sleep.  You sound either drunk or exhausted, and I don’t wanna assume the worst,”  and hung up.  

I couldnt even be mad at him.  I got the time off, but eventually, I would have to drag my barely conscious corpse to work.  And clearly, I was already deteriorating in ways I hadn’t noticed.  Another night to come, and this erosion would only get worse.  

I expected it to be like a learning curve for my body.  That one of these days I would adapt and suddenly feel alive and energized again.  After another day, now a total of five, this assumption desimated.  Time lulls, days are hazes of barely noticed stimulation.  If it wasn't for my phone, I wouldn't know what day it was.  Eventually, it was Saturday, apparently.  I stood against the wall, propping myself upright, staring out the window at the rising sun.  

I turned toward the kitchen table, reached out for my coffee mug.  That simple, sudden movement was all it took.  My head swam, my vision melted as I felt my legs give out.  With a desperate flail, I managed to push off the wall, ensuring I would not cave my head into the table corner.  Loose noodle arms extended, I braced with impact.  A wet pop was the last thing I heard before completely blacking out.

1oiozw2,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1oiozw2/i_28f_love_my_partner_32m_deeply_but_my_doctor/,"I (28F) love my partner (32M) deeply, but my doctor says I can never live with a cat, and he refuses to rehome his.","My partner (32M) and I (28F) have been dating a little over a year. We don’t live together yet, but we’ve talked often about our future together and truly see each other as life partners. Our relationship is healthy, communicative, and full of love. It’s the most stable and supportive partnership I’ve ever been in.

About four months into the relationship, I started having health issues that my doctor traced back to time spent at his place. I was having strong histamine reactions whenever I visited, and after testing, my doctor determined it was mainly due to his cat (7M). Because I also have an autoimmune condition that affects my immune system and makes me immune compromised, my doctor told me I should never live with a cat and should limit exposure as much as possible due to potential long term side effects that could occur. 

This has created a major roadblock for us. Recently, my partner had a health scare with his cat that made him realize how much he loves his cat and he told me clearly that he could never rehome him. While I understand the emotional attachment of having a pet and thinking about them as your “child”, it was really hard to hear, especially since he’s said I’m the love of his life and he wants a long term future together, potentially marriage. I guess what makes it difficult too is that he’s seen me struggle with my chronic illness through pain, surgeries, the emotional side of having an incurable chronic disease, etc. but still doesn’t fully understand why I have to choose my health over a risk like this. I also just feel unfair asking him to rehome his cat, as that’s a big life decision and don’t want to cause resentment. 

He mentioned that if we ever lived together and my health seriously declined from the cat exposure, then he’d consider rehoming him to a good friend or family. But to me, that feels too late. My health would already be compromised at that point.

Beyond the allergy issue, I also struggle with cleanliness concerns. His cat is allowed on the kitchen counters, dining table, coffee table and even inside kitchen cabinets. It makes me feel uncomfortable and anxious, and I just can’t see myself living in that kind of environment, especially given my health background.

We’ve talked about possible compromises/solutions, like living in a split level home and keeping the cat on one floor, but that doesn’t feel fair to the cat or realistic for us. I’d be paying for a home I don’t feel fully comfortable in, and I’d probably feel trapped in my own space. I’ve lived in situations before with past partners that felt unsafe or dysregulating for my nervous system, and I promised myself I’d never go back to that.

The hardest part is feeling like I’m being chosen second to a pet. I completely understand loving an animal deeply, as I have a dog myself. But I know that if our roles were reversed, I’d rehome my dog to a family member or friend if it meant preserving my partner’s health and our shared future. He has close family and friends who would take his cat and give him a great life, so it’s not like he’d never see him again.

We ended the conversation with him consoling me, saying we’d “figure it out,” but I honestly am struggling to see a long term solution that works for both of us. It also hurts knowing he would indeed choose his cat over me. We’re both heartbroken over it and unsure if we’re wasting each other’s time.

TL;DR: My doctor says I can’t live with a cat for health reasons which I only learned after I started dating my partner and had a strong histamine reaction to his cat. My partner (32M) loves his cat (7M) and refuses to rehome him despite the potential effects to my health since I am immune compromised. We’re in an otherwise loving, healthy relationship, but I’m not sure if there’s a viable future given this incompatibility. I also just feel unfair asking him to rehome his cat, as that’s a big life decision and don’t want to cause resentment. 

How would you handle this situation? Has anyone successfully navigated something similar where health/living conditions and a partners pet conflicted? Is there another possible solution I haven’t thought of? Thank you in advance. ",0,1761694062.0,relationship_advice,60,0.38,False

I'm completely charmed - I've been single (by choice, not for lack of good options) for a long time, but boy, did he do everything right.

Can I have things delivered there for him (like if I ordered him cookies or flowers)? Will he even get it? (He's a tactical... something, not a regular patrol officer). Can I go to any of those public relations events cops work at (idk what the term is.

1oioujz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Duskers/comments/1oioujz/new_player_some_questions/,"New player, some questions","Hello all, I know this is not the most active subreddit but I really need your help. I played this game several months ago and even though I liked it I never actually understood it. Last week I tried again and I'm enjoying it but I still feel like I don't fully get the gist of it. I've been a good boy, read the ""Getting started"" article in the wiki which actually led to more questions. Probably many of them you'll feel are dumb questions, but I'm obsessive and perfectionist so I can't help to ask a lot. So here we go:

**Q1) What is the point of this game?**  
Now don't get me wrong, I like it! I love the vibes and the lo-fi and everything make me feel like *Alien* with its old computers. But seriously, what is the goal? If I am not mistaken the game never ends, it just keeps spawning galaxies and systems for you to go on, so provided you have drones and fuel you never stop playing. Which is great, but what should I be aiming for? Just survival? Which leads to the next question.

**Q2) When should I call it a day in a derelict?**  
I have read in some comments that you don't need to explore everything, but this is a scavenging game after all. When I go into a ship my idea is to take as much as I can (unless of course there's some threat I can't get rid of, I accept that). But if survival is the main goal, and we need fuel to travel, what stops me from abandoning a ship if I find fuel in the first couple rooms with no engagement at all? But if I do, then what am I playing the game for?

**Q3) What is the best thing to scavenge from derelicts or what I should focus on?**  
Speaking of fuel, the [Autotrader](https://duskers.fandom.com/wiki/Autotrader) article in the wiki mentions a couple times selling fuel in autotraders as if it was the most beneficial thing to do. But if fuel is what keeps the game going, isn't then the most valuable asset? What is the best strategy then? My main worry was fuel but after reading that I don't know what to think anymore.

**Q4) When do you assess it was a good trip?**  
The last one related with the two above I guess. So considering fuel, scrap and all, when do you say *""this ship was worth the fuel""* upon leaving a derelict? For now the best thing for me is when I get both types of fuel and of course a new drone or at least an upgrade, but I don't know how to properly balance with risk. I like to inspect every room but if I find a drone early on perhaps I should quit while I'm ahead?

  


As I said above I read the ""Getting started"" in the wiki, which includes some ""general tips"" that I would like to comment:

**T4) OPEN THE AIRLOCK.**  
Ok, I once moved my ship without closing airlock 1 and the whole first room (and then some adjacent ones) went full on radiation (beginners mistake lol). I take it if I purposedly open an airlock when a drone or other living threat is in the room I get rid of it? But does radiation always happen as a consequence? If so, may I consider the airlock as a turret that I can't deactivate afterwards (thus making the room impassable)?

**T8) Sometimes it's better to just do a full RESET.**  
All right, this one I honestly don't get. Doesn't reset basically restarts the game from scratch? No drones, no upgrades, no nothing? Then how is it better? Better compared to what? I guess this one's related with Q1 actually.

**T11) You don't have to visit EVERY ship on each system. Prioritize based on your situation.**  
Again, this is related with some of my questions above. I simply don't know when to stop. What's the difference between visiting a new ship in my current system (provided I have the fuel) or trying my luck in a new unknown system? Perhaps if I'm low on resources and the ship is unstable and has three different threats or something like that? But again, if I don't explore that one am I playing only to survive as long as I can?

My final question is related with some numbers I found incoherent. There was a system (Narcissus) I had been in with four ships (I think it was my second one). When I left and had finished another system, the galaxy map showed Narcissus as having 8 objects, 4 visited. But when I look the system there are only four ships. So where are the other four?

  


I think that's it for now. I like the game, I like that I can calmly play it controlling everything with the keyboard while I enjoy a cup of coffee, yet at the same time feeling the tension of the unknown in an *alienesque* environment. But I sense I still don't completely get the game. I enjoy exploring random ships, but with the absence of a clear goal I feel like I'm playing friendly matches in a soccer game. I'm lacking purpose. I notice I don't get the whole picture. Please help me do it! And thanks in advance.",2,1761693700.0,Duskers,0,1.0,False
1oioujp,https://www.reddit.com/r/CCCX/comments/1oioujp/macro_analysis_cccx/,Macro analysis CCCX,"Hello everybody, 

I would like to contribute with a macro analysis perspective on CCCX, to clarify; the purpose is to examine the long term potential while trying to ignore short term noise. 



This analysis will be a bit longer, so get cosy and bring a cup of coffee. Please continue the discussion in the comments! 



Clarifications: I own 210 shares in the company and I have not used AI to write this text if you couldn’t figure it out from my lack of grammar. 



**Political** 



The Trump administration is now considering a $10M investment into a few quantum computing companies, at this point CCCX is not one of the companies mentioned. This investment is considered speculative compared to the 10B dollar investment that went into Intel, which is an established company with a proven concept that’s just fallen behind in the AI landscape. With that being said I don’t think the potential $10M investment should bear too much weight. The interesting thing is that the US government is giving attention and showing interest, they’re also considering QC as a strategically important technology. On the other hand - this does not mean that we are any closer to obtaining a large-scale applicable QC. But it’s one step in a marathon. 

JPMorgan Chase also mentioned that a slice of the $1.5T they are planning to invest into key sectors are going to QC-companys. Another indication that institutional interest is growing.



Viewing a geopolitical perspective we can see that there is a lot of tension under the surface, something I see as advantageous because tension and imbalances are the key factor driving growth and development.  

In 2018, President Donald Trump, then in his first term in office, signed the National Quantum Initiative Act, authorizing $1.2 billion for quantum research and development over five years. 

The interesting thing is that the National Quantum Coordination Office (NQCO) coordinated the operation and assigned NIST, NSF and DEO with focus on improving manufacturing, energy and healthcare. Meanwhile Europe’s Quantum Flagship program, launched in 2018, committed to a 10-year investment of €1 billion, funding thousands of researchers and a wide variety of projects. 

Lastly we have China which is far ahead of both the USA and Europe when it comes to investing in the quantum-section. China has approximately invested $15B into quantum technology research which is mainly state-governed. Beijing is aware of the military advantages in cryptology, national security, communication and information processing this arms race implies. 



Getting to the point - this situation is similar to the cold war, three super powers are entering a new realm which enables a military advantage, probably the strongest fuel to drive innovation and growth (even if it’s irrational). As I see it we are in the early stages with minor breakthroughs, chipping away on the mountain. China has a reputation/history of throwing resources on problems and relatively quickly solving them, for example when they created the atomic bomb in the 1960’s. 

If the USA and Europe is going to be a part of this race, they have to ramp up the spending and raise the stakes sooner or later. Perhaps what we are seeing now is the first step ($10M potential investment in commercial QC-companies).

 If there is any QC company that would qualify for a bigger investment in the future I think it would be CCCX, because of the aligned goals and interests between CCCX and the US-government. This positions CCCX in a great way for the future, even if they aren't among the CQ-companys that might get an investment this time.  

Just to quickly summaries this part: We are seeing the world's superpowers creating quantum technology programs and funding research - China is trying to pull ahead by investing vast sums into state-governed projects mainly to gain military advantages  - meanwhile the US is perhaps in the starting phase of investing in the commercialised companies trying to stay in par and utilize competence within the existing companies to develop military tools etc. If that’s the case we might see more capital flow in the QC-sector which will hopefully translate to further growth, especially for CCCX which is focused on exactly that. Nothing moves the market like governments getting FOMO.

  


**Economical** 



Moving on to the economical factors affecting the quantum landscape. We are now at a ATH in M2 supply which usually indicates a more risk prone investment climate and a rise of liquidity in the financial system. Further on the interest rates are on their way down which also is supporting more risk prone investments. 

Statistics show that VC-firms and institutions are more open to invest when inflation and interest rates are going down and the labour market is strong. A risk is the labour market in the US (showing signs of weakness), aside from that the macro is looking healthy. But the most resilient sectors emerging after and during late stages of covid was AI-tech, climate-tech and health-tech which still received capital flow. The reason these sectors were resilient is because they drive long-term growth, something investors often lean back on when the near term future is looking dark. The way CCCX are positioning themselves is advantageous for funding long-term considering this trend and in a way hedging the risk of lower economic growth, high unemployment levels 



Another interesting aspect is that QT (quantitative tightening) is now coming to an end. Which in turn opens up the question, if we might see QE instead. This might not be the most popular decision right now because the inflation is still not 100% under control, but it’s still an interesting subject for the future. The psychological effect of QT coming to an end might be larger than a decision to initiate QE, just stopping the capital flows going in the wrong direction will probably have an effect. QT coming to an end will lead to more liquidity entering the system once again - that’s good for CCCX. 



Jerome Powell is leaving office 31 January 2026 and is going to get replaced. Judging Trump's way of speaking it’s fair to assume that the new chair will be aligned with Trump's wishes of further rate cuts and easing. The risk is rising inflation and further plummeting of the USD, but a clear pattern is that Big Tech is taking advantage of this weakened dollar - selling more services overseas and receiving more dollars than usual - this explains the increase in earnings for MAG-7. 



Quick summary of this part: The fundamental macroeconomics factors are good, but I have to mention that it’s walking on a tightrope. We might see a down turn if the unemployment rates keep rising which could cause the beginning of a recession - in that case the rates would not be cut for the right reason to generate more risk prone investments primarily. The ultimate case going forward is that the unemployment rates get stable and interest rates are getting cut to stimulate growth - continuing with QE to fully unlock the capital waiting at the side lines to flow into the economy. This could create a great environment for CCCX to lock up funding and continue full force ahead to develop their products. 

  


**Social** 

Going on to the social aspect, I’ll try to explain some important structures in society that’s affecting the quantum sector. 



First of all we have competition from IONQ, IBM and Google, but there’s a big difference in which field of quantum computing these are competing, what goals they have and how they are trying to achieve them. See table below: 



Both Google and IBM can throw more resources on the projects, but CCCX has the advantage of CQ being their primary focus with +130 engineers and physicists working together. CCCX has found the most affordable way to scale their manufacturing of CQ. Compared with IONQ, the biggest advantages as I see it is that they’ve already gone public and have first move advantage. They have proof of concept and are leading the race in terms of qubits right now - IONQ is perhaps a bit more mature in that sense. But their revenue is merely ahead, which show that CCCX is progressing faster right now. We can’t neglect that CCCX already have government contracts, are partnerning with NVIDIA and are apart of a powerful network with loads of key players that have power to unlock new doors. 



Another event that’s hard not to mention is the GTC event NVIDIA just held, it was a short term sell off due to neither CQ-company being named (short term noise). More importantly, it's valuable that CCCX is on the radar and that NVIDIA is looking to integrate CQ with AI to work symbiotically to unlock new tech. Huang mentioned that we will reach 1000 LQB → 10,000 LQB → 100,000 LQB (eventually) and so on, this will elevate the computational potential long term. This emphasizes the potential of quantum computing if we one day get there. I see this as a good sign, because NVIDIA will probably go with the company that has come the farthest when all QC-companys start to reach the finish line and right now CCCX seems to be on the right path. This further confirms that QC-companys will grow into their valuations with time (the ones that survive) and most likely rapidly grow as more key breakthroughs come along. But most importantly it confirms that key players belive that QC can bring long term value and that it eventually will be usefull at scale and actually contribute to solve IMPORTANT problems regualar computers can’t.



Another aspect is that the adoption of QC as a technology and idea is still fairly low, there are still a lot of pessimists among the ones aware of the technology. If you ask your cab driver, he probably doesn't know what it is. The retailers are mainly investing into IONQ, RIGT, QBST and so on, just because of the buzz-word or lack of knowledge, having no clue what the companies are actually doing. This creates a highly speculative market with high risk, but considering CCCX stealthy position (not pushed for publicity nor received a lot) compared to the others I think the majority understand the difference in quality. Putting CCCX in the same basket as the rest of the “garbage” QC-companies doesn't do CCCX justice. This makes me think we have a lot of upside considering this aspect alone, as more time passes and people realise the difference it will move the stock. It’s almost like a beach ball being held under water, eventually it will pop - the longer and further down it’s been held the further it will fly. 



To summarise this part: the structural imbalance between different power figures - contribute to the perception the world have of QC. We are in the early stages of mass recognition (mainly among high risk retail traders that barely know what they are doing) but the majority of people are probably unaware of what QB actually is. Big moves on the market are highly speculative uneducated guesses, and a lot is retail interest trading these companies like a meme stock. Institutions and retail just want exposure to QC-companies if it blows up, this psychological effect spirals the prices, which further confirms bystanders to FOMO in - right now CCCX is a fairly unknown company, blending in with the rest. If CCCX stays on their path, I would think they are going to ride out the storm and emerge as a clear frontier when the rest of all “Quantum Computing” companies eventually fall off. 



**Technological** 

I’m no quantum expert what so ever, I have a background within economics but I’ll do my best to explain some of the nuances of the technological aspect as well. 



CCCX are building their CQ with neutral atom technology, which are easier to scale than trapped ions or superconducting qubits. The challenge is to reach as high fidelity as trapped ions - but at least neutral atom technology is improving its fidelity.

The advantage is that laser technology makes cold atom tech more scalable which has already been demonstrated, but the con is that these laser systems are very complex and expensive. Hybrid potential, CCCX also works on quantum sensors and networking, not just computing which have great potentiall for space exploration, communication and nationall security. This is something CCCX is already taking advantage of, partnering with DARPA, US Department of Defense, and universities on quantum sensing and atomic clock tech diversifying revenue streams. Targeting markets without a lot of competition. 



As more governments back quantum technology, the stakes are getting higher. The combination of artificial intelligence and quantum computing could unlock new levels of technological advancement as mentioned before. According to a Bank of America Institute report, with AI accelerating quantum development and quantum providing the necessary computing power for AI. An interesting correlation, which might invite more investments into QC-field further along the way. 



I don’t want to get deep into all the technical stuff, because I’m not too sure about it. But to summarise this part: from what I understand IONQ is relying on their high gate fidelity to minimize their quantum error correction (QEC) to achieve logical QB’s, meanwhile CCCX is relying on their more scalable approach to add more qubits with lower fidelity to obtain logical QB’s. But right now IONQ is stagnating at becoming more scalable, at the same time as CCCX are making big improvements in achieving a higher gate fidelity to lower the QEC - this implies that CCCX are solving their biggest problem, meanwhile IONQ is making incremental improvements in comparison. 

Worth adding - CCCX’s natural path and road map to a 100-1000 qubits and many logical qubits is looking more realistic considering the pace they are reaching their goals. 



**Summary** 



Time to summarize, this has been a macro analysis of the current market, focusing on the quantum sector. We are seeing the broader patterns of tension between China, Europe and USA when it comes to developing quantum technology. The US is considering an investment into commercial QC-companies which might be the start of something larger going forward. 

The economical landscape is advantageous for risk prone investments and we have good reason to believe it’ll continue to be a good climate during Trump’s last term considering the new FED chair getting filled. A risk is if the unemployment rate doesn't get under control. 

CCCX is still not a mainstream QC-company - meaning it’s probably undervalued compared to its peers, looking at how they are valued compared to other QC companies. They are making big moves under the surface which sooner or later will emerge to the surface. 

We are still in the early phase of adoption when it comes to the concept of quantum technology - institutions and retail just want exposure - leading to overseeing which companies will come out on the other side of the storm. 

CCCX cold atom tech is the most natural roadmap to +1000 qubits and many logical qubits, with scalable application. Showing impressive results in attaining higher gate fidelity - closing the gap to IONQ. 

All and all bullish on CCCX - seeing a lot of potential for further appreciation in the coming 5-20 years, I’ll remain long in the positions I got. 



I just want to remind everybody that’s reading, this is in no way financial advice, just my opinion. It’s still an extremely high risk investment and a lot of speculation. 



It’s been really fun writing this analysis, please let me know what you think about it and come with feedback! It’s been a broad subject and it’s hard to cover everything, but I’ll try to write another more in-depth macro analysis sometime in the future, focusing on one or two aspects at the time. 



I got some more time later this week, please let me know if you would like a more in-depth analysis of the potential market valuation in the future (2030-2040) and valuation analysis of CCCX as of right now. In that case I’ll be more nuanced and totally focus on that area with more calculations and statistics to support my arguments.

1oiou12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/1oiou12/why_not_an_apionly_accounting_platform/,Why not an API-only accounting platform?,"I have never met anyone who *likes* QuickBooks. Business owners hate it. Tax preparers hate it. Tax lawyers hate it. Accountants hate it. The common theme is loathing.

After a year building an app that talks to QBO’s API, I now hate it at a deep personal level. The documentation is incomplete, self-contradicting, and sometimes flat wrong. Huge chunks are not documented at all, so you end up spelunking through forum threads to answer questions like “How deep can sub-accounts nest” or “Is this enum even valid.” The API actively punishes you for following the docs. It feels like a dumpster fire with raccoons, and someone gave the raccoons grenades.

And that is just the backend. The frontend experience is also universally despised. Slow. Busy. Opinionated. Unintuitive. Everything is a tradeoff and none of the competitors actually “fix” it. They just move the pain around.

So I ended up with this idea: **What if the accounting platform itself was API-only with no native UI at all?**

All features are manageable through the API. Webhook callbacks are available for any dataset. At this rate the frontend becomes a commodity, allowing you to choose the right one for your business.

* Do you run your business completely from your Iphone? Find an app-integration you like and buy it.
* Running a veterinarian clinic and don't want to have to step over vast swathes of the UI designed for coffee shops, machine shops and tire shops? Then pay for the provider who sells a veterinarian specific integration.
* Wishing you could use parts of platform A but then do your invoicing from platform B? No sweat, open integration means it's the same data in both places.

In order for this to work you'd have to follow a model that's similar to AWS. Provide the infrastructure that gets you 80% of the way there and then use a third party platform designed for your business to get you the last 20%. Although in this case any integration would have to be structured around the end user owning all data that lands on the platform. So for example if you go to platform A and the provision you an account on the API platform, you'd have to be able to take that account with you when you departed. So you could set up an account on platform B and connect it the account platform A provisioned for you.

I'm not sure how billing would work, I guess you as the customer would have to pay for your API account and pay for whatever integration you selected. So it would be two bills every month

That's my idea. After wrestling with the QBO API for the last few years I find myself wondering why it's considered the best option by so many people. And also hated by so many.",1,1761693664.0,Startup_Ideas,1,1.0,False
1oiotbf,https://www.reddit.com/r/oregon/comments/1oiotbf/oh_snap_holding_out_a_halloween_helping_hand/,Oh SNAP! Holding out a Halloween Helping Hand,"Imagine being a parent on SNAP this week, knowing that the food safety net isn’t going to be there next month. They need to project normalcy to their kids and it’s Halloween, so they’re taking the kids out trick-or-treating as usual. They know the kids will get their candy, but all the while they’ll wonder what the kids will eat next week?

Wouldn’t it be great if they found people offering something to them as well? 

I propose that we each set out meal kits in a bag, ready for any SNAP parent in need to discreetly grab while their kids are getting candy. 

Set them out under a sign that says “For SNAP parents” or something similar. Don’t make a big deal out if it, and don’t make them ask for it: they don’t want their kids to know.

I suggest each kit be a sturdy grocery bag containing the ingredients of a meal for 4. (Any SNAP parent out with their kids will have *at least* two mouths to feed.) Prepare more than one kit, as many as you can, and each time one is taken refresh the offering. (If you end up with extra, you’ll find a way to use or donate it.) 

Make an effort to provide ingredients for a **complete** meal for 4: a box of Mac and Cheese is not completely helpful without the other ingredients it needs for preparation, right?

The ideal meal kit will include the things it’s hard to get from a food bank: protein (canned fish or chicken for example), fat (sticks of butter, tubs of margarine, or bottles of oil), fresh produce, milk,  etc.

Consider setting out pantry staples (flour, rice, salt, sugar, coffee, tea, etc), or non-food items too (TP, hygiene supplies, etc.) for those who need just that one thing.

This is a best-effort situation. Do what you can afford, even if it’s only cups of ramen. Anything helps, and this is a marathon not a sprint. 

This is not a substitute for donating cash to food banks. The need is going to be greater and more persistent than one meal kit. Do what you can there too. 

These meal kits will offer some hope (and maybe even a bit of joy) in the face of a looming struggle. It’ll let them know we see what they’re up against, and that we stand with them. 

Feel free to repost this wherever you like, copy and paste to other services, or whatever else to get the word out.

I’m an entrepreneur based in Noida with a few successful startups behind me. and a coffee lover for over 15 years. Lately, I’ve been thinking about starting something close to my heart: a small coffee venture built for people who love good coffee but are always on the move.

Here’s the idea:
I want to introduce a grab-&-go coffee culture in Noida. The plan is to start with a small 6x6 kiosk serving only a few essentials: espresso, doppio, cappuccino, americano, and latte. Nothing fancy, just really good coffee made right.

I’m exploring locations like malls or business complexes where people can park easily. Ideally, it could even have a drive-through option or quick car delivery during morning rush hours. The focus will be on takeaway only, great quality, and affordable pricing, cheaper than what most cafés charge, but without compromising on the taste or experience.

The brand name I’m considering is “Rush.”
I have the capital to invest and I’m okay with initial losses. I mostly want to explore this idea the right way.

I’d love to hear your feedback, validation, or criticism from this amazing community of coffee lovers. Would something like this appeal to you if you lived in Noida (or a similar city)? What would make you stop by such a kiosk every morning?

The image here is just a an AI mockup of what kiosk may look like.

Thanks in advance! ☕

P.S. I know some might say I shouldn’t share an idea like this publicly because someone could steal it. I get that, but I also believe ideas are easy, execution is everything.

French x Modern Australian and still entirely modern inventive Japanese food. An absolute steal at JPY19,800 for the 12 course chef’s choice menu.  

Hard to pick a winning course because everything was great. The lobster was meaty yet melting, in a rich crab sauce that was almost vanilla-edged. The eel was crispy and light and set off beautifully against the creamy guacamole and the crisp pickles. The wagyu stew was a complete flavour bomb. The pigeon was incredibly tender and perfectly cooked. And the desserts showcased seasonal produce wonderfully.

All produced single-handed by Kuriwaki-san, in a constant blur of hospitality and cooking, for 7 guests this evening (which admittedly does make for a rather long almost 3 and a half hour dinner). 

Alcohol pairing with 13 pours including American sparkling, Slovakian Chardonnay and Merlot, Japanese beer and sake, an Australian Picolit, a couple of lovely Japanese whites, and cold filtered coffee for another JPY15,000.

1oiong7,https://i.redd.it/1rcbar7fqxxf1.jpeg,Amy’s Diary — Tuesday: After-School Smoothie Chaos!,"Dear Diary,
Today after school, we went straight to Coffee Day again — because Zoe said she needed “taste testers” for the Halloween smoothies! 🍨

The moment we walked in, it already smelled like pumpkin spice and caramel. The café looked busier than ever — fairy lights everywhere, spooky stickers on the counter, and even a cardboard ghost cutout saying “Drink… if you dare!”

Zoe waved from behind the counter. “Perfect timing, girls! We’re trying out new flavors for Friday’s charity booth — want to help?”

Of course, we said YES!

Winfrey was the first brave volunteer. She tried a smoothie called Pumpkin Delight — and her eyes lit up. “It’s like autumn in a cup!” she said dramatically.
Then Carmen grabbed the next cup, labeled Witch’s Mix. One sip later, she squeaked, “Whoa! Why does this taste like bubblegum and cinnamon had a spooky baby!?” Everyone burst out laughing, even Ayaka behind the counter.

Meanwhile, I tried a green smoothie Zoe called Monster Mint. It was delicious — sweet, minty, with a little sparkle of sugar on top. I told Zoe it tasted like Halloween magic. She smiled and said, “That’s the idea.”

Then came the funny part — Siu Ling accidentally grabbed a blender lid that wasn’t closed tight. When she pressed the button… PFFF! Pumpkin smoothie exploded everywhere! 😂
It splattered on the counter, the floor, even Haruka’s apron.
“Ahh! My uniform!” she yelped, trying not to laugh.
Zoe just sighed playfully. “Well, that’s what we call a Pumpkin Shower.”

Mr. Tanaka came in from the back room with a towel and said calmly, “Looks like we’ll need extra paper cups and… maybe a mop.”
Everyone burst into laughter again.

After cleaning up, Zoe gave us all a cup of the final recipe — Haunted Pumpkin Cream. It was creamy orange with chocolate drizzle shaped like a spiderweb on top.
“This one’s going to be the star of the charity booth,” she said proudly.
We all agreed — it was perfect.

Before leaving, we helped hang the last batch of paper bats near the window. Penny joked, “If I see one of these fly for real, I’m quitting Halloween.”
Winfrey added, “Unless it’s a cute vampire bat.”

When I got home, Mom asked why my school shoes smelled like cinnamon. I just said, “Long story — involving a blender, a bat, and Zoe’s new invention.”

This Halloween is getting better every day.

I woke up to a violent scream. An annoyingly loud, painful scream. That scream, of course, coming from me as my left leg sat comfortably at a ninety-degree angle. I’d never really felt pain like that; a pain that makes it seem like it would’ve been better waking up to my leg simply chopped off instead. My stomach had been cut by the boards, so I was bleeding onto the floor a little. I tried to slide around or make any movement but all I could feel was my knee touching the ground in a way I definitely shouldn’t be feeling it do that. All in all, I felt pretty screwed.

I looked around to find some way out, but it was too dark to really tell. It seemed like a basement, but I had lived in this house for years and it never had a basement. At least, not a basement my dad had ever mentioned. The only bit of light I had was coming from the hole that I made falling through the stairs. I reached for my phone and painfully pulled it out of my pocket. Turning on the flashlight, I could make out more of the room. A square cement room with mildew stains, completely empty with one closed wooden door. I couldn’t get a call out and my battery was quickly dying so I decided the only way out was hopefully wherever that door led. I ignored the pain as best I could and got onto my stomach. 

The floor felt damp as I baby crawled my way across the room and I couldn’t get the smell of ash out of my nose. It felt like an hour before I reached the door. I could make out some scratches at the bottom almost like someone had already clawed their way out of this room. It did help to open the door from the ground, the actual door had no knob to it, so it just took a good few pulls to get it to scrape against the floor. Once I got the door open enough for me to squeeze through, I kept pushing myself along the floor by the door frame and was able to make it halfway through a hallway before I needed a break. 

I turned on the flashlight again and could see where the hallway ended. Another doorway. It wasn’t that far away, but my flashlight couldn’t light the room it led into at all. A pitch-black room. I took a breather before pushing myself down the hallway again. My head was pounding and I could feel my body giving up, the pain feeling more unbearable by every second. The floor got colder as I got closer, the smell of ash got stronger and the room I was crawling into only seemed to get darker. 

My eyes felt heavier once I passed the doorway; I could almost make out a noise. A quiet hum. It felt nice, almost made the pain ease as I went deeper into the darkroom. What was that feeling? Like a hushing lullaby that only got louder the more my body shut down. I couldn’t push any farther, I didn’t want to be left down there and forgotten about. Dying in the grungy basement of an insane man, the only woman I’d ever loved moved on and only being with me in my memories, the idea of an easier life being brought down by my own stupidity and my trust in this house to bring it to me. I started to cry. I don’t know, at that point I thought I couldn’t cry, but there I was sobbing into a cement floor. Mom. I wanted my mom. Whoever that was, hopefully how she seemed when my father described her. To imagine a love, I’d never gotten and to think it would make everything better. Fuck, I felt stupid. 

I started wailing and screaming for help; screaming like a kid that scraped their knee. It felt like the room was getting darker by the second. I tried to reach for my phone, but it was so dark I couldn’t even see my own hands anymore. I didn’t know what was happening to me, what I had gotten myself into. I thought of Lila; how simple things were when all I needed was her. I blacked out after that. Maybe it was from all the pain, maybe it was from the lack of sleep and desperation, maybe it was from the pale white arms I started to see growing in the depths of the dark room. Either way, something caused me to go out. 

I could feel warm sunlight, the glow shining slightly through my eyelids. The smell of ash had transformed into the smell of a freshly cleaned house and fresh cinnamon rolls. I could hear the clutter of dishes being washed and it made me open my eyes. I was back in the living room somehow, laying on the couch I never bothered to sit on. It never felt comfortable, but right then it felt like the softest cushion I’d ever felt. How did I get back up? Who was in the kitchen? “Hello?” I called out. My voice was raspy, and my throat felt dry. I hadn’t realized how long it had been since I’d really spoken. 

I could pick myself up enough to sit upright on the couch. The pain was still faint, and the memory of my collapsed leg was still fresh in my mind, but my knee was back to normal. Same thing for my sides. I looked down at myself and noticed my fresh and clean looking clothes, although when I smelled them enough I could still get a whiff of mildew and ash. “Don’t get up, honey. I’ll be there in just a second.” The voice of a woman came from the kitchen. I listened and sat still on the couch and a few minutes later she came into the room. 

A familiar face carrying a plate of cinnamon rolls and a glass of milk. All I could make was confused, “Cinnamon rolls?” as she set them down on the coffee table in front of me. She smiled and took a seat on the couch while humming quietly. I looked at her face. Whatever stranger she was, she was a familiar one. I think she could see the confusion on my face as she wrapped an arm around my shoulders. She gave me a peck on my forehead, “You’re okay now, hon.” She kept humming. I thought back to my dad’s stories, where I had heard that song before. It was my dad’s favorite song that he used to sing to me when I was younger. I wrapped my arms around her tentatively and after my heart stopped nearly beating out of my chest, I let out one word. “Mom?” She smiled at me as if she’d been waiting forever to hear such a word. “Not just me. Your dad will be home soon.” 



I know this part took some time. I scrapped the original idea I had for it and decided this is where I wanted the character to be for right now. It did make me tear up this morning as I was writing it. Thank you.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Nashville Predators vs. Tampa Bay Lightning: A Battle of Two Doormats, With More Skates Than Goals**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a hockey game so low-scoring, it’ll make a nap during a PowerPoint presentation feel like a thrill ride. The Nashville Predators (2-2 in their homestand, 2.5 goals per game) host the Tampa Bay Lightning (2.67 GPG, 0-for-15 on the power play) in a matchup that’s less “showdown” and more “two old friends awkwardly agreeing to disagree over coffee.” Let’s break this down with the statistical rigor of a man who once calculated the odds of his cat knocking over a vase… and then bet against himself.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Tale of Two Toaster Offenses

The Predators are listed at **+250** (implied probability: \~28.57%) on DraftKings, while the Lightning are **-156** (\~61.29%). That’s the kind of line that makes you question if the bookmakers checked the box scores or just asked fans, “Which team sounds more like it’s from Florida?” Nashville’s recent homestand? A rollercoaster of “we’re building!” energy, per Coach Brunette, which is code for “we’re not terrible, but we’re not great either.”

The total goals line sits at **5.5**, with the under priced slightly higher. Given both teams rank in the bottom six in goals per game, this feels like betting on a race between two sloths who also have a mutual dislike of movement. The Lightning’s power play? A tragic comedy. Zero-for-15 in their last 15 attempts is like a golfer who only hits the green once every 18 holes—and that one time, they still three-putt.

---

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Milestones, and a Lot of Sighing

**Nashville’s Hopefuls**:

* **Roman Josi**, their Swiss maestro of defense, is out with an upper-body injury. Without him, their blue line is like a sieve that’s been told to “sift flour”—it’ll let everything through and then cry about it.
* **Jonathan Marchessault** returned from injury and scored against Dallas, breaking a 11-game power-play drought. Let’s just say Nashville’s power play is less “dominant” and more “a toddler trying to assemble IKEA furniture.”

**Tampa’s Troubles**:

* The Lightning’s power play is a statistical abomination (0-for-15), and their 2.67 GPG is about as exciting as a tax audit.
* **Andrei Vasilevskiy**, their goalie, has a stel

“Honey! Is the mac and cheese ready?” 

7 a.m. and here I was, pulling an aluminum pan of homemade macaroni and cheese out of the oven. Ridiculous the things I had to do now that we were a good, church going family. I sighed, placing the pan carefully onto pot holders on the countertop. “Yes, it’s finished,” I called back, smoothing the skirt of my long-sleeved floral dress with my hands. 

Twenty-three years of being married to this man and I never expected he would become so devoted and uptight about something as silly as church. We weren’t even religious before he got moved to a new department for work. Then, suddenly, we were “devout”, sitting in the same pew every time the doors were open. 

And it was all against my will. 

I have never cared about appearances, especially not enough to rearrange my whole life. But Gideon seemed obsessed. Though that was no surprise. Anything to get him a step up with his job. Even attending the same church as his boss. Too bad he wasn’t that much of a kiss-ass at home. 

Speaking of, he finally came out of the bedroom, still adjusting the cuff of his neatly ironed button up as he walked into the kitchen. Dark hair styled just right. Flashy watch on his wrist. Picture perfect for taking in the Lord’s word. 

His eyes lifted and I could feel the scrutiny behind his glasses. “Didn’t you wear that last Sunday?” 

I rolled my eyes, settling my hands on my hips. “Two Sundays ago. Why? I like it.” 

“Hmm.” 

And that was it. All he had to say, but I knew he didn’t approve. Not that I cared. After spending so much time getting ready along with waking up early to fix a dish for the monthly potluck, there was no world where I was going to change. 

Gideon turned and grabbed his mug from the cabinet, shifting his attention to the coffee I’d already brewed. “Is Clay ready?” 

“Should be,” I answered. “I woke him up a little while ago.” 

“I’m sure he turned right back over after you closed the door,” he mumbled, shaking his head before taking a careful sip. “Might want to go make sure.” 

Of course, another thing on my plate. I wanted to tell him to go do it himself, but that would just start an argument. So, I just nodded and went upstairs like the good little housewife he trained me to be. 

I knocked, and that deep grumble from the other side just pissed me off more. Gideon was right. When I went in, I was met with a big lump in the bed, lights still on from when I came up before, and the smell of sweat and stale beer. “Clay. I already told you to get up. We need to leave soon.” I groaned, going over to the closet to get his clothes out. Twenty-two years old and still needing his mom to wake him up. Though that was probably partly my fault. 

“But Ma,” he whined from under the blankets. “I don’t wanna go to church. It’s so boring.” 

Again that morning I had to roll my eyes as I grabbed a light blue button-up and khaki slacks off their hooks, tossing them down on the foot of his bed. “Clay, no one wants to go to church. Just humor your father.” Every Sunday came with this exact argument. I couldn’t really blame him. It was boring as hell. “He’ll be gone for work next week… maybe I’ll let you skip out then,” I offered. 

“Ugh. Fine.” With that last little gripe, he finally sat up, brown hair a mess and looking like he stayed up most of the night. 

“Thank you. Get ready and come downstairs. Don’t take too long,” I said sternly, slipping out of the room to give him some privacy. 

Now that everyone was squared away, I stopped at the hall mirror on my way back to the kitchen, wrinkling my nose at what I saw. My long, bottle-dyed black hair was washed and nicely styled. Makeup caked on to hide the bags under my eyes and the wrinkles that looked deeper by the day. My hands ran over the slight belly I gained over the years of staying home, my insecurities flaring for a moment before I turned and kept moving. 

Gideon was nowhere to be found when I went to cover the pan of mac and cheese. Probably outside with a cigarette between his fingers and on some stupid business call if I had to guess. At least I had another moment of silence before we had to leave. Soon, with everything ready to go, I found myself leaning against the counter with my vape in one hand and phone in the other. Puffing and scrolling mindlessly, wishing I could be doing that in my pajamas on the couch for the rest of the day instead of wearing those uncomfortable ass granny heels Gideon deemed holy enough for me to be seen in. 

“We got breakfast, Ma?” Clay’s deep voice cut through my peace, but I didn’t mind. As needy as he could be, he was still my boy. Even if he towered over me and looked nothing like the sweet little thing he used to be. 

Looking over my phone, I arched my brow. “Boy, I’ve been up all morning making food for church,” I answered with a small laugh. “Grab a granola bar to hold you over. And do up that top button.” 

Clay grumbled but did as he was told, heading to the pantry. 

Minutes later, Gideon entered from the sliding glass door, still tucking his phone into his pocket and smelling of cigarette smoke. “Morning, son. You look sharp,” he said, coming over and adjusting Clay’s collar for him. 

Clay stood still for him and gave a sleepy smile. “Thanks, dad.” 

The sweet little moment was over when Gideon glanced over at me and frowned. “Thought we talked about you doing that outside,” he said, eyes flicking from my face to the purple vape in my hand. 

“You talked about that,” I corrected without hesitation. “Got any more complaints? Or are you ready to go?” 

His frown deepened, but thankfully he dropped it. “Go ahead to the car. I need to put on some cologne.”   
  
After grabbing my purse and the mac and cheese, I stepped closer to Clay and sniffed the air around him. “You too. Deodorant, now.” 

Clay groaned, still chewing the last of his breakfast bar. “Damn. I forgot,” he said, tossing the wrapper in the trash on his way back upstairs. 

And just like that, we were on our way in the sleek SUV Gideon bought after his promotion. Both Clay and I with our noses in our phones while Gideon listened to a boring news station the whole way. Of course, the church his boss went to was on the other side of town. After around forty-five minutes we finally pulled into the small packed parking lot of Willow Grove Baptist. 

I got out carefully, adjusting my skirt before grabbing the covered aluminum pan from the backseat. Letting Gideon and Clay take the lead, I followed close behind them, taking in the people filing into the holy building. Everyone in their Sunday best, each family with trays and platters of dishes, just like us. We blended in quite well. 

Better than we had any right to. 

As we moved closer in the line of patrons, I got a glimpse of… him. Silas Whitmore, the preacher's son and only piece of eye candy in the place. It was pretty fucked up of me to see him that way, not only because we were in the house of the Lord, but because he was somewhere around Clay’s age. I just couldn’t help myself. Not with that broad, tall stature, strikingly handsome facial features, and a head full of neatly combed back blond hair. 

He stood just inside the entrance, as he always did, in a dark green sweater over his white button-up and black slacks. Warmly greeting everyone as they came in by name. It slowed the flow of people, but added a nice little touch to what would be a boring activity as a whole. 

“Good morning, Mr. Dalton,” Silas said with that charming smile of his as he shook my husband’s hand before his attention shifted to Clay. “Morning, Clay.” 

“What’s up, man? Been here since dawn I bet,” Clay teased playfully as we walked inside, the last in the line as usual. 

Silas laughed, cute little dimples forming on his cheeks. “You’d be right. Sunday starts early for us.” 

Then, his icy blue eyes settled on me and my back instinctively straightened. “Good morning, Mrs. Dalton. You look lovely.” It was a standard compliment. Probably one he gave out a hundred times already that day. Still, it sank deeper than it should have. Heat prickled the back of my neck as my heart started thumping harder and faster. 

“You’re too sweet, Silas,” I said with a soft laugh, tightening my grip on the tray. 

“Just being honest, ma’am,” he chuckled. “We have changed up the way we’re putting the food out for the potluck. I’ll show you, if you like.” 

I nodded and glanced over at Gideon and Clay, who were on their way into the sanctuary to sit at our usual pew. “That would be great, thanks.” 

Silas led the way down the little hall to a communal room the church used for all kinds of events. The room was already set up with fold-out tables, chairs, and a long counter jam packed with food. “What’cha make?” he asked. “We’re trying a new way of organizing the dishes to make things easier.” 

“Macaroni and cheese,” I answered and Silas brought us to the middle section of the counter, shifting things around until a spot was made where I could place the tray. 

“You know… and don’t tell anyone I said this,” Silas said, his smile shifting to something more sly. “Your food is always my favorite.” 

That really flustered me and it shouldn’t have. I know he could see the light blush settling on my pale cheeks. “Oh, you flatter me too much. You better watch it or it’ll go to my head,” I laughed, trying to brush it off. 

“No, I’m serious, ma’am. You’re an amazing cook. Mr. Dalton and Clay are really lucky,” he doubled down, glancing around to make sure no one overheard. 



I shook my head, mostly trying to ground myself. “Well, if you really feel that way, you should come by for dinner sometime.” 



And that was how it all started. 



A simple dinner invitation.

#▌Main stories covered:

>- **[NEWS]  Bloomberry sells Korean casino subsidiary...** **Bloomberry** [BLOOM] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=fa7451d18bc9b821ec6e1601ccee8f59)] has announced its exit from the casino business in South Korea, marking the end of a decade-long effort to sell its underperforming venture. In a disclosure on 24 October 2025, BLOOM said its South Korean indirect subsidiary, **Golden & Luxury Co. Ltd.** (G&L), will spin off and subsequently sell its casino business on Jeju Island to **Gangwon Blue Mountain Co. Ltd.**, which has made a down payment of ₩500 million. Since 2015, G&L has operated the Jeju Sun Hotel and Casino, which has been on the market for several years as its operations continue to struggle to recover from the pandemic-induced downturn. Jeju Sun’s gross gaming revenue dropped 93% in the second quarter to ₱2.5 million.
>    - ***MB:*** This sale has been a looooong time coming. For those who have been reading BLOOM’s quarterly and annual reports for a while, as I have, BLOOM’s Korean assets almost pop off the page through all the notes and analysis for their sheer waste. I’m not sure what took BLOOM so long to make this sale since the Korean assets have been sad and lame for years, and BLOOM’s owner, **Enrique Razon**, is known to be a quick and decisive operator. It’s crazy, because the first time it occurred to me that BLOOM should sell, it was when physical casinos were hot and I wanted them to deploy all the capital into that business. The next time I thought that, it was when BLOOM was breaking into the digital gaming space when e-gaming was hot and I wanted them to deploy all the capital into that business. That’s why Ricky’s the best: he knows when to hold em. Or at least he knows how to look like he knows.

>- **[UPDATE]  Asiabest backdoor delayed by valuation wait...** **Asiabest** [ABG] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=14f730cebc551726ec6e1601ccee8f59)] disclosed that the initial valuation of the assets it plans to fold into the company is expected to be confirmed “around the end of October,” with management committing to establish the foundation and final details of the transaction to “ensure that all key details are aligned before moving forward.” In a response to the Exchange’s query on 28 October 2025, ABG said the final valuation details will be presented to the Board of Directors for formal approval in the “first week of November.” The company added that the necessary documentation will subsequently be prepared for presentation to shareholders. The PSE already approved a 10-day voluntary trading suspension of ABG starting on 14 October 2025 following shareholder calls for greater transparency on the planned vend-in of Concrete Stone Corp., Industry Movers Corp., and Kabalayan (through PremiumLands Corp.). ABG said the trading pause aims to “ensure full transparency and proper price discovery.”
>    - ***MB:*** As noted by Bilyonaryo ([link](https://bilyonaryo.com/2025/10/28/dolomite-beach-maker-francis-lloyd-chua-misses-own-valuation-deadline-keeps-asiabest-fold-in-in-limbo/property/)), ABG’s new owner (**Francis Lloyd Chua**) has already exceeded the timeline he gave investors for the valuation the assets that could be backdoored into ABG. While the delay isn’t necessarily a big deal (what’s another two to four weeks in the grand scheme of things?), I’m starting to get vibes from Mr. Chua’s conduct that (at least for me) will cause me to stay far away from ABG (or whatever it will become) until it can prove itself to be stable, transparent, and reliable. I’m not even thinking about Mr. Chua’s involvement in the Dolomite Beach scandal; besides, how can I be mad at a guy who did so much for my mental health during the lockdown? (/s)

>- **[UPDATE]  Apollo Global president to pursue “diversification efforts within the digital sector”...** **Apollo Global** [APL] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=62934083b8371fd1ec6e1601ccee8f59)], the PSE’s only undersea mining company, told investors that its President, **Bonner Dytoc**, had been granted “full authority” by the APL board of directors to “proactively identify and advance strategic business opportunities”, with a focus on “creating synergies that strengthen the Company's core operations” while also “spearheading diversification efforts within the digital sector.” It has now been 1,730 days since APL first told its shareholders and the investing public that its only mining vessel, the **MB Siphon I**, was in “in position” and ready to begin commercial operations. In the 247 weeks that have passed since that announcement was made, APL has failed to mine a single metric ton of ore. It has, in the 57 months since that announcement, found time to conduct a follow-on offering to buy a stake in the MB Siphon I, changed its President, repaired its tugboat, and renovated its head office.
>    - ***MB:*** Are we going to get a shitcoin? ALL WE WANT IS FOR APL TO MINE IRON ORE FROM THE SEA BED, LIKE IT SAID IT WOULD DO 4.74 YEARS AGO. Is there even a boat? What are these clowns doing? If I was a younger man, I would buy a million shares of APL (don’t worry, that would only cost P9,000 because this stock sucks), and go to its newly-renovated office at Antel Global Corporate Center in Pasig (near Megamall) every day demanding to see meeting minutes, the stock transfer book, board resolutions, and whatever correspondence I could get my hands on. Not to harass the company (as that would not be a legitimate purpose for requesting those records), but to protect shareholder value (which is a legitimate purpose). I’d take pictures of everything I see (without being a creep or weirdo), and I’d try to get a sense for how many employees actually report to work each day, and of those that do report to work, what time they arrive, what time they leave, and how long they take lunch. If all we get after all this time is some half-baked woowoo Xurpas-like digital bullshit, I’d want all of that data to support the lawsuit that I would absolutely file on behalf of myself and any other aggrieved APL shareholders that are tired of being gaslit. Fortunately (for my family), I’m an older man, and I have more important things to do with my time (like trying to find the best Vietnamese Coffee in town). Current leader is Wildflour. Cheer me up by DMing me with any alternative suggestions in the Makati area!

Hey there! I’m 33, married but open, demisexual, and looking to meet someone curious, kind, and open-minded. I’m an easygoing guy who spends way too much time in bookstores and thinks autumn is the best season by far. Horror movies, long hikes, and daydreaming about life’s odd little mysteries are my idea of fun.
I’ve got a mellow, thoughtful vibe — but I love good conversation, laughter, and that spark of connection that just clicks.
If you’re the kind of woman who enjoys cozy weather, deep talks, or just happens to rock a pair of Chucks, I’d probably enjoy your company already. Let’s swap favorite horror movies or find out which local coffee shop has the best vibe.",2,1761692632.0,asexualdating,0,1.0,False

With 3 kids in cat seats it’s a game changer plus we’ve had it for over a month and have only filled it up once which is insane!!!!! So happy overall…. EXCEPT THE CUP HOLDERS. wtf?! 
There are like 20 in the thing and 1 of them holds my large bottle. If I have my yeti with coffee in it I have to decide which one I want to basically balance on top of the cup holder that’s too small, and hope doesn’t spill all over the middle console!! A small but simple change they could have made for this model. So many people have larger cups these days… I can’t be alone in this complaint?! ",11,1761692620.0,ToyotaSienna,14,0.79,False

1oiod0a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/1oiod0a/i_was_recording_a_video_but_another_me_is_there_i/,I was recording a video but another ME is there. I didn’t do what she’s doing,I was making a video on tiktok. It was a continuation of a previous video which was a conclusion so nothing super detailed. I talked for around 3 minutes paused and talked again for 1-2 minutes while I made a coffee and concluded the video. When I went to edit the video the second cut was no longer there and instead it was ME DOING STRANGE THINGS AND STARING INTO THE CAMERA while doing them. It was about 4-6 clips which I did not record and I dis not do what she is doing in them. I am beyond confused and was completely freaked out over it for weeks. I can’t figure out how they got there. I talked the entire video never once did I sit doing nothing and being weird. Could it be some sort of AI testing??? I have video proof of this but not sure If I can post it here. Has this happened to anyone else? ,8,1761692499.0,Glitch_in_the_Matrix,18,0.73,False
