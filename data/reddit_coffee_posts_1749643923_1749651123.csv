1l8tlea,https://i.redd.it/as5kb6g62b6f1.jpeg,Anxious Behavior - Knocking Things Over,"Hi! I have a very anxious 4.5 year old aussie mix and the past year he has started a weird behavior that I don’t know how to address. He gets set off by notification noises (which I never have on anymore but sometimes the tv has them) and verbal expressions like if I gasp/cry/sneeze/etc. Whenever he gets anxious he will go to the nearest surface (coffee table, night stand, bookshelf, counter) and knock everything off with his nose. Then he’ll continue going around the house and do it to other things. 

I haven’t been able to find much online on how to correct this behavior. It’s gotten to the point where he does it at other people’s houses and breaks stuff. I am moving in with a roommate in a couple months and would love to get this under control. 

Anyone have any advice!? TIA! Pic of the cutie attached!",1,1749650835.0,OpenDogTraining,0,1.0,False

1l8ti8l,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1l8ti8l/welcome_to_your_kitchen/,Welcome to Your Kitchen,"*Thump*

Nick turned over in bed. Back to sleep.

*Thump thump*

*It was probably nothing,* he thought. He lay in his queen size bed and listened for more noise. Nothing. He started to doze off again.

*Thump thump thump*

Nick bolted wide awake. It was a new house. He had moved in a few weeks ago. He had heard a few creaks and groans before, but this was different. More rhythmic.

He wiped the sand from eyes and checked his phone for the time. *2:30 AM*. He put his phone in his pocket and made for the bedroom door.

*Thump thump thump*

*It was probably just an animal,* he thought. He still had to check. A first time homebuyer at thirty-two years of age, he felt he needed to do the responsible thing. Probably a raccoon. Best case scenario he could scare it away. Worst case scenario, he’d be putting in a call to animal control and getting an extra cup of coffee before work in a few hours.

Nick made his way down the stairs and saw a faint red light in the kitchen. Did he leave his oven on?

He heard a shuffling and noticed a large amorphous shape had replaced his dining room table. He walked towards it, into the kitchen.

*CLUNK*

Bright searing lights turned on all over his kitchen and conjoined dining room right as he stepped through the threshold, as if he had stepped on a tripwire that activated them. His eyes took a second to adjust to the blinding brightness. He looked around where his dining room table had been, he saw two rows of people in theater-style seats facing the kitchen. He recognized all of them.

His third-grade teacher Mrs. Pemberton, the guy who cut him off in traffic last Tuesday, and someone who looked exactly like the stock photo model from his insurer’s website.

He saw his college roommate Chad, who still owed him $50 he borrowed and lost in a cryptocurrency pyramid scheme.

Even his great aunt Gertrude, sitting in the corner and crocheting a sweater that read “It’s Your Kitchen, Nick”.

“*Wait, didn’t she die like 3 years ago?*” Nick thought to himself.

They all watched him with an expectant look. The giant flood lights illuminated his kitchen, where he saw two podiums. One was empty, at the other was a middle aged man with a combover and too much bronzer in an electric blue tuxedo who held a long baton with a small sphere at its end. It was a microphone.

“What the hell! How did you people get-” Nick started.

“Hey Nick!” The man in the blue tuxedo interrupted. “I’m sure you’re wondering what we’re doing here, isn’t that right folks?”

A din of agreement and nods of varying enthusiasm came from the crowd that almost paradoxically fit inside his modestly sized dining room. One man, who Nick recognized as his car mechanic from back when he lived in Boston, shouted “That’s right!”.

“Well, Nick, my name is Chuck Bazzleton,” The man at the podium said, his voice booming over speakers Nick couldn’t find, “and we’re here too play…” Chuck smiled and pointed the mic at the crowd.

“IT’S! YOUR! KITCHEN!” The crowd roared in unison.

Nick looked around and felt a wave of vertigo.

*How did these people get here? There was a production crew. A camera man. An “on air” sign glowed red where he had hung his NASA deep space photo calendar.* After a moment, Nick’s awe and amusement turned to anger.

“No. No. I have work in the morning. I am calling the cops.” Nick said calmly.

*A collective gasp from the crowd.* Nick took his phone out of his pocket and dialed 911.

“Now, Nick, that isn’t very sportsmanlike of you” Chuck crooned. “What do we think of that folks?”

The crowd booed and a few showed their thumbs down for Nick.

“Why don’t you just be a good sport and play the game, Nick?” Chuck added as Nick waited for the call to connect. Nick heard a momentary dial tone.

“911 What’s your emergency?” The operator asked.

“Yes I’m at 121 Chestnut street, and people have broken into my home.” Nick answered calmly, a smirk growing on his face.

“Just play the game, Nick” the operator said calmly before hanging up.

“Wait! What? Hello?” Nick exclaimed into the phone, as he looked around the room.

“You heard what the nice dispatcher said, Nick” said Chuck Bazzleton. He patted his hand on the empty podium. “Why don’t you just come over here and play. The prize tonight is-”

“No. No!” Nick interrupted. “So you have someone on the inside. I don’t care. I know where the police station is. I’ll just drive over there and tell them”.

“I wouldn’t recommend that, Nick.” Chuck said, his voice growing a bit more hostile. “Hey folks, what do we call a contestant that doesn’t want to play?”

“LOSER!” The crowd said in Unison.

Nick put on his shoes and grabbed his car keys. He opened his front door, but instead of seeing his quiet suburban street, the front door opened up into, his kitchen.

Nick ran to the back door. Before he opened it, he had a feeling he knew what he would see on the other side of the door.

When Nick opened the door, he didn’t see his backyard. He saw exactly what he had seen out the front door.

He felt a dark and foreboding dread build in his gut. He turned back to his kitchen and looked at the empty podium. Chuck and the crowd looked at him longingly. Chuck motioned for Nick to come on stage.

“What is it we say folks?” Chuck said, holding back laughter and pointing his microphone to the crowd.

“IT’S! YOUR! KITCHEN!” The crowd cheered.

“That’s right.” Chuck said through eerily white teeth “And that’s all there is!”

Nick walked back to the kitchen. He saw they had moved his trash can to make room for the two podiums. He stood behind the podium and looked back at the crowd, dejected. Chuck beamed at Nick as cheesy game show music played from the speakers Nick still couldn’t find.

“So glad to have you here Nick. Now tell us, where do you hail from?” Chuck asked.

Nick was incredulous.

“Here. I come from right here. We’re in my house.” Nick said waving his hands around at, well, everything.

“That’s right! We’re in your home! 121 Chestnut, isn’t that right folks?” Chuck exclaimed. “Or it wouldn’t be” He turned the mic to the crowd as Nick closed his eyes in despair.

“IT’S ! YOUR! KITCHEN!” The crowd boomed.

Eyes closed, Nick began to whisper to himself “This isn’t real. This is a dream. Just wake up Nick. It was probably those noodles”.

“Nick, I assure you this IS real” Chuck said. “It has nothing to do with those nine-day-old noodles you had for lunch the other day. Now are you ready to play the game?”

“Sure” Nick said with a resigned shrug.

The crowd cheered.

The lights felt hot on Nick’s skin as Chuck took out some cue cards.

“Ok Nick we’re ready to start playing.” Chuck said as he looked down at the first cue card. “What… is your biggest regret?”

As soon as Chuck had asked, all of the lights, save the spotlight trained on Nick, dimmed. Chuck shoved the microphone in Nick’s face.

“Is this hell?” Nick asked.

The crowd erupted into raucous laughter, and Chuck brought the microphone back to his own face.

“Well that’s not the answer is it folks?” Chuck asked.

“NO!” The crowd sang.

“Now let’s try this again.” Chuck said, the grin widening on his face. “What is your biggest regret?”

“I don’t know.” Nick started. The crowd began to boo. “Ok let me think! Let me think. My biggest regret was probably… Not getting my masters in engineering”.

A loud siren rang as soon as Nick was done talking.

“That is incorrect!” Chuck said with a mischievous grin. “Your biggest regret was breaking up with Janice. She was such a nice girl, you really could have made a life with her.”

“Wait what? How do you know what my-“ Nick started.

“Alright folks,” Chuck interrupted “that was round one, now it’s time for a word from our sponsors”. He smiled into the camera and froze for a moment as the cheesy theme music played again. The lights dimmed, and a serious voice came from everywhere and nowhere.

*“Alright people! That’s commercial, we’re back in five.”*

In an instant, there were two people standing on either side of Chuck Bazzleton. One patted his face and seemed to be applying makeup while the other handed him a bottle of water. The water had a label that just said “It’s Your Kitchen” in plain black text over a white background.

After the makeup artist and assistant walked off to god knows where, Bazzleton turned to Nick, his voice gravelly, his smile more subdued. “You’re doing great kid. The camera loves you.”

“What the hell is going on! How do *you* know my biggest regret? Why can’t I leave?” Nick exclaimed.

Chuck turned to the crowd, pointed a thumb at Nick and asked “How about those first timer jitters, folks? Huh?” With a chuckle.

Nick heard a voice he recognized from the crowd. It was his former employer from the power plant, Mike Schmidt, “Just play the game Nick! Don’t overthink it!”

Nick took his phone out of his pocket and attempted to call his dad.

“You really think that’s gonna do anything?” Chuck said with a sneer.

The phone started to ring before blinking an “out of service” message. Nick tried to call again, but the phone ran out of battery. He had been charging it next to his bed all night.

“How is this possible? Why are you here?” Nick screamed. The crowd seemed unfazed. He took a soup ladle off of his counter and started destroying the podium. He must have hit it a dozen times, the cheap fiberboard coming apart. He struck the lights, shouting like a feral animal. He had destroyed two of them and began laughing maniacally.

“Whose… kitchen… is it… Now!” He exclaimed as he destroyed the set, the crowd now looking on with mild interest and disapproval. He pointed the ladle out to the crowd. “And why is my great aunt here? What the FUCK is that?” He shouted. Gertrude didn’t even look up from her crocheting.

He turned back to Chuck Bazzleton and looked down and to his right. The podium he had just destroyed stood there with no visible sign of damage. The lights were on again, not a scratch to be seen.

He pointed the ladle at Chuck Bazzleton’s face, and shouted at the top of his lungs “WHAT IN THE FUCK IS GOING ON?”

Chuck, completely unmoved by Nick’s outburst, shrugged, lean forward, and said “I don’t know, kid. It’s just another gig for me.”

Nick gripped the large metal ladle in both hands like a baseball bat and hit Chuck square in the jaw.

The man went down like a sack of potatoes. Blood pooled on the floor as Nick looked down. He heard the clunk of the spotlight turning back on and felt the heat on his neck.

The voice came again. It wasn’t from the speakers. It almost seemed to come from earbuds in Nick’s ears. But he wasn’t wearing earbuds.

*“Alright folks and were back in five, four, three…”*

Nick saw the camera man count two and one with his hand. Nick turned around to see Chuck Bazzleton, completely unscathed, standing at his podium smiling his irritatingly charming grin.

The theme music played.

“Alright folks, welcome back, were here with Nick tonight, and it’s time to play…”

He pointed the mic at the crowd.",1,1749650614.0,stories,0,1.0,False

1l8tgyn,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1l8tgyn/sri_lanka_trip_report_dec_2024/,Sri Lanka trip report dec 2024,"This post is about six months late. But my husband and I travelled to Sri Lanka for 12 days last December and I wanted to share my itinerary and experience. We booked a cab with a driver, they charged us a flat rate of 600 euros for the whole duration. Other options we came across were also charging similar rates.

Food prices varied a lot. It was pricier at the beach areas, more so at Mirissa. While in Nuwara Eliya we went to a pizza place, that was like tourist prices while other restaurants were more normal. Kandy had normal prices.

Our itinerary looked something like this:

Day 1: Flight to Sri Lanka. Pick up cab. Stop at Colombo for lunch and drive down to Hikkaduwa. Getting in and out of Colombo was crazy, mainly due to traffic, it took a lot longer than expected. Also I had not planned stopping at Colombo but just looking at the city, I felt like it was worth a stop... especially as someone coming from India. The cleanliness, the footpaths! I was in love, and awe. By the time we reached Hikkaduwa it was already dark and past 7pm. ETA on google maps was not quite accurate. And this continued for the rest of our trip.

Day 2: Hikkaduwa. I wasn't really sure about Hikkaduwa, because it wasn't quite popular on the travel circuit on instagram and stuff, but I think it's an old tourist spot. Checked out the turtle beach area and the reef area nearby. Lots and lots of hawkers, they're trying to sell you seaweed for the turtles or snorkel masks or boat trips.. rate that they ask you is way over line. So definitely haggle a bit. It got a bit cloudy in the evening, although no rain.

Day 3: Hikkaduwa, we did a trial scuba diving in the morning. Didn't like it, the beach was super crowded, left it and went down to Narigama beach and chilled there. Rained in the evening, quite heavily.

Day 4: Drive down to Mirissa. On the way stopped to see Galle and stopped at the Rumssala Peace Pagoda near Unawatuna. We reached Mirissa after sun down. Galle was really nice, could easily spend a whole day there, roaming about the sights and artsy shops. Also had some great restaurants. The peace pagoda was

Day 5: Went whale watching in the morning (spotted a whale!). Returned by afternoon. Went down to Mirissa beach and spent the rest of the day there.

Day 6: Mirissa beach, coconut tree hill, all of that. Mirissa seemed a little more pricey than Hikka. The beach/waves were rough, even though we went into the water after some time there would be a massive forceful one and all the people would clear out of the water after it. The smaller waves were okay. There were also a lot of russians in Hikka, while the crowd in Mirissa seemed more varied.. and somehow, it felt more hip. That was, perhaps, the vibe of the place. There were beach clubs and parties in the evening, but we didn't go to any.

Day 7: Drive to Nuwara Eliya. We reached Ella by lunch time. Had lunch there and checked out Ravana's cave and the nine arch bridge before continuing our drive. We reached Nuwara Eliya by 8pm.

Day 8: Nuwara Eliya. Horton Plains was on the plan but I was kinda tuckered out so we took it easy, went to the Seethamman Kovil and Hakkagala garden which was lovely. And then in the afternoon, we checked out the lake and had coffee at a cafe and went back to the hotel.

Day 9: Drive down to Kandy. Stopped at Ramboda falls on the way. Reached Kandy by afternoon, had lunch at the city center. Walked around the lake and market area before checking in.

Day 10: Sigiriya and Dambulla caves. This ended up being a Saturday, so it was quite crowded. Also we started early morning and it pretty much took the whole day.

Day 11: Relaxed at the hotel. Went to Udawatta Kele Sanctuary and walked the trail. When we left from there, it started raining, so didn't do anything else.

Day 12: Checked out of the hotel, went to the Temple and all the museums there. It took up the whole morning. We grabbed a quick lunch and drove down to the airport to catch our flight.

This was my first time planning an international trip, and I got a bit carried away by all the various places to see, but I would no recommend skipping about so much. My energy levels waned by the time we reached Day 7. But... everything was absolutely beautiful. The natural beauty in Sri Lanka is truly something else, the forests, the mountains and the beaches were all spectacular. While Ella gets all the attention, I really liked Nuwara Eliya. The people were very kind as well. The food was very close to south indian so for me it was quite similar in terms of flavours. Entrance fees for foreigners was pricey again, you get some concession at Sigiriya if you're from a SAARC country (carry your passport!). For a more comfortable trip, I'd say pick maybe 2-3 places or add in a more time at some of the places. I'd have like to have checked out Colombo, even though we did see Galle it was a bit rushed because we started late that day.. so a little more time on hand would be nice. And I think just exploring the south west beach belt would be a great holiday as well. And then spending time in the mountains would be good too. The only reason we went up to Kandy was to see Sigiriya and Dambulla. We didn't do any safaris because.. we'd have preferred going to Yala but that was a little way off our route, so dropped it.",5,1749650525.0,travel,2,1.0,False

I'm developing an isekai game for couple of years. I love how my game works but not sure about the story. I'm trying write a good story like those I love reading in light novels but struggling with writing for the game. I decided first to try write a light novel and than adapt it to the game.

RE: Spin. Die. Repeat. - Prologue

The hum of machines filled the air — artificial, relentless, almost comforting. I sat slouched on a torn vinyl stool, my eyes burning from another week of unpaid overtime. My finger hovered over the spin button, trembling slightly. Not from excitement. Just the cheap beer. Or maybe from knowing, deep down, that I’d hit rock bottom months ago and just kept digging.

Five reels spun before me, a blur of fruit, numbers, and other symbols. Two 7s lined up perfectly — bold, red, glowing — and the third reel hesitated, clicking slower, almost teasing... and stopped on a lemon. Just one symbol off. Just enough to hurt.

Another spin — two scatter symbols, pulsing with promise, and I held my breath. The fifth reel spun, slowed... nothing. No third scatter. No bonus.

One more. Three bells spun into view — diagonally. Not even on an active payline. Just close enough to make me believe I could win if I kept spinning. Like handing a kid an ice cream cone and then slapping it out of his hands just before he takes the first lick.

Around me, neon lights smeared across dirty walls, the stench of old cigarettes clung to everything even my thoughts. Someone coughed two rows down. No one looked up. Just more lonely souls chasing a miracle through spinning reels.

Another spin. Another failure. My thumb pressed the button like it had muscle memory for despair.

I had dreams once. Real ones. Big ones. When I was twenty, I’d thought about starting my own company — something sleek and smart, maybe web-based, maybe app-powered. I’d imagined giving speeches, signing deals, living out of a suitcase because the world needed me. But then... life happened. Rent first. Then bills. Then, a fintech job that promised experience but delivered ulcers. I let myself get buried. I stopped calling friends. Stopped meeting new ones. Stopped everything but working and spinning.

My boss dumped his work on me again this week. Said it was a learning opportunity. Said it with that grin that made me want to break my keyboard over his head. Instead, I smiled, nodded, and stayed late four nights in a row. Now it was Saturday. Past midnight. And this was my reward: feeding the same machine that had rarily paid out.

Somewhere in my head, I imagined turning to the pretty girl two seats left and saying something charming. Something suave. She’d laugh. We’d talk. She’d ask what I did and I’d lie, but not too much. We’d get dinner. I’d walk her home. It’d be easy.

But I didn’t say anything. I never did. I stared at the reels and dreamed about a version of me that could.

The screen flashed. Two glowing 7s locked into place in the first reels — my breath caught as the third reel began to slow. This could be it. But the reel clicked into place with a bell... then the second bell followed right after, just enough to hint at a second possible win. My heart surged, just for a second. The fifth reel clicked, slowed... and stopped on a lemon. Not a third 7. Not a third bell. Two chances — two failures. I almost laughed. Almost.

Another spin. My last token. I pressed the button.

That’s when my phone buzzed, slicing through the noise with a shrill ring that felt like a slap. I didn’t need to look to know who it was, but I did anyway.

""Boss: EXT.""

I hesitated. For a second, I considered ignoring it. Pretending I was asleep. Dead. Something. But then I swiped to answer, my voice barely a whisper.

""Hello?""

""Where are you?"" he snapped. No greeting. No breath between words. ""I need the Q3 summary in my inbox — now!""

The machine's reels clattered behind me like they were in on it. I almost said it. I almost told him I was off-duty, that I'd worked late every night this week, that he could go to hell and spin his own damn numbers. But my mouth betrayed me.

""I… sorry. I’ll fix it. Right away.""

He hung up without another word. My chest tightened. I stared at the blinking slot screen one last time, then stood, knees stiff.

I shoved the phone into my coat pocket and stormed out, barely dodging a guy in a stained windbreaker who was too drunk to care. The neon lights smeared into a blur as I pushed through the doors, cold night air smacking my face like a wake-up call I never asked for.

I muttered to myself, loud enough to almost mean it. ""Wish life worked like slots... just spin the damn reel, win or lose, and be done with it.""

But it didn’t. No clean outcomes. No rules. Just people like me, stuck pulling levers, hoping for miracles that never came. I kept walking. Back toward the office. Toward that goddamn skyscraper — all glass and steel, its logo still glowing like a middle finger against the sky.

The streets were empty at this hour. Just me and the wind knifing through my coat. It whipped my hair, tugged at my collar, made me stumble.

I pressed forward. Head down. Teeth clenched. My boss’s voice echoed in my skull, every syllable etched with years of contempt: ""You’re always late. You never think ahead."" Over and over. I mouthed the words with him like a prayer to a god I never believed in.

This was my life. Just another grind toward a paycheck I could barely survive on. I didn’t know how to do anything else. Data entry wasn’t just a job — it was all I had. I was replaceable, disposable, and I knew it. But losing this? Even this? Terrified me.

So I ran. Not because I wanted to. Because I didn’t know how to stop. Toward whatever pile of crap my boss had left on my desk.

The elevator ride up was dead silent, just the soft hum of old cables and the taste of stale metal in my mouth. I stepped out onto the twelfth floor, lights dimmed to after-hours gloom. Every desk was dark. Every chair empty.

The kitchenette was just around the corner — a sad little cubicle of caffeine desperation. One flickering fluorescent bulb buzzed overhead, casting sickly light on empty coffee cups, dried creamer spills, and a plate of donut crumbs that looked fossilized.

My stomach groaned. I hadn’t eaten since morning. I opened the fridge like it might hold salvation.

It didn’t.

Just a greasy white box shoved to the back, the cardboard damp with condensation. Someone had scrawled “Anchovy Pizza” in Sharpie. My nose wrinkled before I even opened it.

But hunger overruled disgust. I peeled the box open, revealing two lonely slices clinging to their soggy paper liner like castaways.

I shoved both slices into my mouth, trying not to breathe through my nose. The anchovy stench hit like a slap. I gagged, swallowed, and washed it down with lukewarm tap water.

Terrible decision. But I was used to those.

I shuffled back to my cubicle, still chewing the aftertaste of salt and regret. My dual monitors blinked to life as I jiggled the mouse — spreadsheets everywhere, windows stacked like ceremonial offerings to some vengeful god of deadlines. A half-crushed energy drink can perched at the edge of the desk, one more wrong move away from spilling all over my keyboard.

I sank into the chair. It creaked like it knew me. Like it was tired too.

I started typing. Eyes heavy. Head swimming. Numbers blurred, but I forced them into place, cell by cell, line by endless line. The Q3 summary wasn’t going to write itself — and if it did, my boss would probably still find a way to blame me.

Some part of me whispered, If I just get through this, maybe I can sleep. Just a few hours. Maybe.

But I wasn’t sure “later” would ever come. Not really.

By 1:45 AM, I was still staring at the screen, my fingers twitching over the keyboard like they’d forgotten how to form words. The columns swam in and out of focus. Each cell flickered, blurred. My temples throbbed.

I checked my watch. Almost forty-four hours without sleep. That couldn’t be right. But it was. I blinked, and the spreadsheet split in two. My heart skipped.

The world narrowed. Like a tunnel collapsing inward. I gripped the desk, tried to breathe steady, but the sour tang of that anchovy pizza rose in my throat. My stomach twisted.

I think I whispered, “Not now…” or maybe just thought it. My vision fractured into shards. My hands slid off the keys.

Panic flared in my chest. Somehow, I ended up back in the elevator. Maybe I staggered there on instinct, thinking fresh air would fix the rotting ache twisting through my gut. The doors closed behind me with a hiss, sealing me in.

Cold metal walls gleamed under the flickering red of the floor display. I pressed the 'L' button with a trembling finger. It lit up with a weak ding — like even the elevator couldn’t muster any enthusiasm for me.

As it began its descent, my knees buckled. I grabbed the railing, skin clammy, every breath shallow. The nausea hit like a wave, pulsing through every limb. My heart pounded behind my ribs like it was trying to punch its way out.

“Not here,” I muttered. “Not like this.”

I clung to consciousness with both hands, forcing myself upright, praying I could make it to the lobby. Maybe someone would be there. Maybe they'd help. Or maybe I’d just collapse on the street where no one would notice.

But the world kept spinning, and the floor numbers blinked past like a countdown I hadn’t agreed to.

The elevator dinged, and the doors slid open to a gray slice of dawn. I took one step out.

And then another. My legs felt like wet noodles — every nerve screaming, every breath a struggle. The air outside bit into my lungs, sharp and damp with last night’s rain. Streetlamps still burned overhead, casting pale halos on the empty pavement like someone forgot to turn off the world.

The lobby had been empty. Not even a night guard. No one.

I stumbled toward the street, my vision tunneling again. Everything tilted sideways. But then — a sound. The distant wail of sirens, growing louder.

Ambulance.

I don’t know how, but I found myself stepping off the curb, one foot into the road, then the other. Rain slicked the asphalt, made it shine like glass. My hands flailed, waving, reaching. I saw the red lights cresting the far end of the block.

A surge of something — not strength, just desperation — shot through me. I dragged myself forward, out into the center of the street.

“Help…” I croaked. My voice was barely air, but inside my skull it roared. Get up. They’ll help you. At least here I’m lucky. At least this once.

I lifted one arm high — a desperate signal to the blinking red hope racing toward me.

But it didn’t slow.

The tires screeched far too late. The lights blazed across the slick pavement. And for one frozen instant, I saw the driver’s face—eyes wide, mouth open, shouting something I couldn’t hear.

Then came the impact.

My world shattered.

A scream tore from my throat, but I couldn’t hear it over the crack of bones, the thud of flesh, the brutal silence that followed. I was flung backward like a ragdoll, pain exploding through every nerve before darkness slammed the door shut.

The paramedics rushed to me. I think one of them was yelling. I think someone touched my wrist.

But at exactly 2:00 AM, they declared me dead.

Lying there, I wasn’t angry. Not scared. Just… hollow.  And then even it faded.

Except — just before it all vanished — the dark blinked.

I was somewhere else.

A casino floor, but not the one I’d known. This one shimmered, surreal — like someone painted Las Vegas on the surface of a dream. Marble veined with starlight stretched beneath my feet, and slot machines stood like monoliths in an endless row. Neon halos pulsed above, casting my shadow in all directions at once.

“Spin the machine…”

The voice came from nowhere — smooth, amused, female — like someone mocking me gently from behind a velvet curtain.

My hand moved on its own, gripping the golden lever of a massive machine. It pulsed warm beneath my fingers. I yanked it down.

The reels spun. Symbols blurred. My heart didn’t beat — it clicked with every turn.

Then — *snap* — the first reel stopped. My face.

Second reel. My face again.

Third. Still me.

Dead center line. Triple match.

The machine erupted with a warped jingle like a children’s toy slowly running out of batteries.

“Congratulations,” the voice cooed. “Triple Death achieved. Your rewa—”

The words cut off like a tape yanked from the player.

I gasped.

Air — thick, smoky, real — clawed its way into my lungs. My eyes flew open.

I wasn’t in the street. Wasn’t under blinking red lights or sprawled across cracked pavement. No sirens. No spreadsheets. No slot machines.

Wooden beams loomed above me, low and dark with age. A lantern sputtered weak light from a hook in the corner, shadows flickering across rough stone walls. The smell hit next — damp earth, old ash, herbs crushed underfoot. A fire had burned recently.

I tried to sit up. Failed. My limbs felt like they’d been poured from concrete.

There was no suit. No badge. Just scratchy fabric tugging against my skin — a tunic, maybe, and loose breeches that smelled faintly of smoke and something herbal.

I stared at my hands. Pale. Smaller? Younger? Or maybe it was the lighting.

No… I thought. No, this isn’t right.

My mouth was dry. I tried to swallow. Pain flickered behind my eyes, but no nausea, no gut-twisting fire. Just… disorientation.

“Where am I?” I whispered.

A beat of silence.

Then my own voice answered, half-dazed: “I… I died and woke up here?”

The thought came out of nowhere. Ludicrous. Obvious. Exhilarating?

But something gnawed at the back of my mind. A question no one had asked yet.

Wait… what actually killed me?

Was it the anchovy pizza? Forty-four hours without sleep? The moment my head hit the keyboard? Or did the ambulance finish what my lifestyle started? Maybe it was all of it...

I wanted to laugh. Instead, I just stared at the ceiling.

Then the door creaked.

A figure stepped into the flickering lantern light — an old man in simple robes, face lined with years and soot, carrying a steaming wooden bowl in trembling hands. He looked like he'd been carved out of oak, with eyes that had seen far too many winters.

Behind him, someone peeked around the frame.

Cat ears. Brown, twitching. A maid outfit in black and white, ribbons sharp as her amber eyes. Her tail swished once, curious.

I blinked. My brain short-circuited.

A catgirl.

Not cosplay. Not a drawing. Real. Real ears. Real tail. Real everything. My entire adolescence punched me in the face like a rerun of every fantasy forum thread I never had the guts to post in.

She was beautiful in the exact way that made my inner fifteen-year-old implode. My chest tightened — not from pain, but from awe, disbelief, and something dangerously close to euphoria.

Is this heaven? I thought. No. Better. It’s the opening cutscene of my new life.

She blinked at me.

“Ah, you’re awake,” the old man said, shuffling in. His voice was dry, but kind. “We found you collapsed outside the tavern.”

The catgirl stepped in slowly, gaze never leaving me. Her expression was unreadable. Calm. Bright. And for some reason, vaguely amused.

Relief crashed over me like a wave. Not alone. Not abandoned. Not a hallucination in a hospital bed.

The old man introduced himself — something like Garrin, I think — but my ears were barely listening.

""I’m Luna,"" the catgirl said simply, her tail flicking once.

Luuuna.

Of course her name was Luna. It fit too perfectly. Too impossibly.

I should probably introduce myself, I thought. The polite thing to do. But the moment I reached for it — that name — I recoiled. It didn’t fit. It never did.

They called me by a name I hated. Even my parents knew — they’d seen how I flinched when they said it, how my shoulders tensed every time it echoed through the apartment walls. And still, they used it. Like it was some obligation, or punishment. One I never had the guts to escape. Too much paperwork, I told myself. But the truth was simpler. I didn’t believe I deserved to be someone else.

I didn’t believe I deserved a better one.

Not yet.

But now?

Now I could start over. Clean slate. All the junk stripped away. No passports. No HR records. No quiet judgments that made me shrink. I could be anyone.

I grinned, weakly.

I’d take a new name. Something bold. Heroic. Something like... Keanu Gosling. Dumb, I know. But it sounded cool in my head. Cooler than I’d ever been.

Yeah.

That name sounded like someone who could actually live.

I cleared my throat. ""Keanu."" ""Keanu Gosling,"" I said aloud, testing the syllables like a fine wine. They felt strange on my tongue. New. But also... right.

Luna tilted her head, one ear twitching. Then she grinned, ""Weird name,"" she said. ""But in a good way.""

I laughed, and it felt like the first real laugh in years.

Garrin raised an eyebrow. ""Well then, Keanu. Mind telling us how you came to be passed out outside my tavern?""

My breath caught. Think.

The casino. The reels. The crash. The pizza. The overtime. The name. Everything blurred together like a nightmare montage.

My heartbeat ticked up. I opened my mouth. Closed it. Opened it again.

""I... I don’t know,"" I said, panic bubbling beneath my skin. ""I think... I lost my memory.""

It wasn’t a real lie, right? Just... convenient. 

They didn’t press. Garrin just nodded, muttering something about rest and recovery. Luna’s eyes lingered on me a moment longer, but she said nothing — just tilted her head and smiled.",1,1749650366.0,u_Financial-Cat7366,0,1.0,False

I was just a small-town Montana girl, fresh off the bus in New York, when I landed a paralegal gig at Sterling, Cromwell & Finch - the Everest of law firms.
Then Ethan Sterling, the devastatingly handsome senior partner, noticed me. A k*ss, a secret, an ""arrangement."" For four years, I was his dirty little secret, hidden in the shadows of his gleaming towers.

Chapter 1
The call came on a gray Tuesday morning.

My cell phone vibrated on the cheap nightstand I'd bought for this temporary apartment.

A number I didn't recognize.

I answered.

""Ms. Hayes?"" a crisp, unfamiliar female voice asked.

""This is Maya Hayes,"" I said.

""This is Patricia from HR at Sterling, Cromwell & Finch. I'm calling to confirm that your resignation, effective last Friday, has been processed.""

Her tone was flat, like she was reading from a script.

""All outstanding payments, including unused vacation days, will be direct deposited by the end of the week.""

""Thank you,"" I managed.

""Have a good day, Ms. Hayes.""

Click.

No 'we're sorry to see you go.' No 'good luck in your future endeavors.'

Just processed. Final.

It felt like a door slamming shut, quietly but firmly.

My four years there, erased with a bureaucratic keystroke.

Chloe called an hour later.

""So, it's official?"" she asked, her voice softer than the HR woman's.

""Official,"" I confirmed, trying to sound breezy.

""You sure about this, Maya? You haven't told me the real reason. 'Seeking new opportunities' is such corporate BS.""

I forced a laugh. ""Just needed a change, Chloe. You know how it is. New York grinds you down after a while.""

""If you say so,"" she said, unconvinced. ""But if Ethan Sterling had anything to do with this, I swear...""

""He didn't,"" I lied, the name a sudden, sharp pressure in my chest. ""It was my decision. Purely professional.""

There was a pause. I knew she didn't believe me.

""Okay, Maya. Whatever you need. But call me if you want to talk. Really talk.""

""I will. Thanks, Chloe.""

I hung up, the lie bitter on my tongue.

I stood by the window of my small, rented room on the Upper West Side.

It wasn't much, but it was mine, and it was far from the gleaming towers of midtown.

My gaze fell on a small, velvet box on the dresser.

I hadn't unpacked much, but that box... I'd taken it out.

Inside lay a pair of delicate diamond earrings. A birthday gift from Ethan, two years ago.

Impersonal. Expensive. Like everything he gave.

The city spread out below, indifferent. My mind drifted back.

Four years ago, I was fresh from Montana, a full scholarship to a paralegal program in New York under my belt.

The city was a beast, glittering and terrifying.

Sterling, Cromwell & Finch was the Everest of law firms.

Getting a job there felt like winning the lottery.

I was determined, wide-eyed, and completely out of my depth.

My first cubicle was smaller than my childhood closet.

The clothes I wore, bought on sale, felt cheap next to the tailored suits and silk blouses that rustled through the halls.

Chloe Davies, a fellow paralegal, took pity on me.

She was city-smart, quick-witted, with a wardrobe I envied and a kindness that was genuine.

""You look like a deer in headlights,"" she'd said on my first day, offering me half her bagel. ""Stick with me, Montana. I'll show you the ropes.""

Ethan Sterling was a name whispered in awe and a little fear.

Senior partner. Razor-sharp. Devastatingly handsome in that old-money, East Coast way.

He was in his early forties then, with a charisma that filled any room he entered.

I saw him mostly from a distance, a titan striding through his domain.

He rarely acknowledged junior staff like me.

But I noticed him. The way his eyes, a cool, assessing blue, missed nothing.

The way he could charm a hostile witness or eviscerate an opposing counsel with a few quiet words.

My heart, foolish and young, developed a secret, schoolgirl crush.

I knew it was ridiculous. He was a world away.

I buried it deep, focusing on my work, determined to prove myself.

I worked late, took on extra assignments, learned everything I could.

One Thursday night, almost a year into my job, I was working late on a discovery deadline for one of Ethan's cases.

The office was mostly empty, quiet except for the hum of the HVAC and the distant city sirens.

I was in the firm's library, surrounded by stacks of documents, coffee cold beside me.

The door opened. It was Ethan.

He looked surprised to see me. ""Ms. Hayes, still here?""

""Just finishing up the briefing binders for the Keston trial, Mr. Sterling.""

He walked over, picked up a binder, flipped through it.

His proximity made my breath catch. I could smell his cologne, something subtle and expensive.

""Good work,"" he said, his voice low. ""Thorough.""

He looked at me then, really looked, for the first time.

His eyes lingered.

""You should get some rest,"" he said, but he didn't move away.

The air crackled. My pulse hammered.

He reached out, his fingers brushing a stray strand of hair from my cheek.

A jolt went through me.

Then he leaned in and k*ssed me.

It was unexpected, overwhelming.

My carefully constructed professional boundaries shattered.

Against every sensible thought in my head, I k*ssed him back.

The next morning, a small, unmarked envelope was on my desk.

Inside, five hundred-dollar bills. No note.

My stomach twisted.

It felt clinical. A transaction.

Later that day, he called me into his office.

His demeanor was all business.

""Ms. Hayes,"" he began, not meeting my eye directly, ""last night was... an error in judgment. It won't happen again in a professional setting.""

I nodded, my face burning.

""However,"" he continued, finally looking at me, his gaze unreadable. ""If you were amenable to a more... discreet arrangement, outside of office hours...""

He named a figure, a monthly ""allowance,"" he called it, that made my head spin. More than my salary.

""I'm not looking for a relationship, Maya,"" he said, using my first name for the first time outside of that k*ss. ""I'm not capable of one right now. This would be... companionship. Physical.""

He paused. ""No strings. No expectations beyond what we agree.""

I should have walked out. I should have been insulted.

Part of me was.

But the larger, longing part, the part that had secretly adored him for a year, ached.

I thought of the bills in my purse. I thought of his k*ss.

""I understand,"" I heard myself say.

It wasn't long before I learned about Seraphina Blake.

Her name would come up in office gossip, whispered by senior associates who remembered.

""Ethan's one true love,"" someone said once at an after-work drinks Chloe dragged me to.

""The one that got away. Broke his heart, they say.""

Seraphina Blake. A name that sounded like old money and effortless glamour.

I saw her picture once, tucked discreetly into a silver frame on a low credenza in Ethan's office, almost hidden behind a stack of legal journals.

Blonde, beautiful, an almost ethereal quality to her smile.

They said she'd left him for a European prince years ago.

Ethan never mentioned her. But her ghost was always there.

It solidified what I already knew: I was a placeholder. A convenience.

My significance in his life was minimal, confined to darkened bedrooms and hushed encounters.

Despite it all, despite the clear terms, despite Seraphina's shadow, I fell deeper.

The ""allowance"" went into a separate account, mostly untouched. I didn't want his money, not really.

I wanted him.

His rare smiles, the fleeting moments of shared laughter after a difficult case, the way he sometimes looked at me when he thought I wasn't watching - I collected these crumbs.

one night, after a particularly stressful week, we were at his penthouse.

He was quieter than usual, staring out at the city lights.

I took a breath, my heart pounding. ""Ethan,"" I said, ""I know what you said about no strings. But... I care about you. More than I should.""

He turned, his expression unreadable.

""I want to be with you,"" I blurted out, ""even like this. Even if it's all I can have.""

I was offering myself up, knowing the terms were his, always his.

He was silent for a long moment.

Then he said, ""Are you sure, Maya? I can't offer you more.""

""I'm sure,"" I whispered, a fool in love.

For four years, that was our life.

A secret, lived in the margins of his real existence.

Late night calls. Discreet arrivals and departures from his apartment.

Never a public acknowledgment. Never a dinner date that wasn't room service.

My friends, my family back in Montana, knew nothing.

Chloe suspected, I think. She'd give me knowing looks sometimes, but never pressed.

I told myself I was content.

I had a part of him, didn't I?

He was brilliant, sophisticated. He challenged me intellectually, even if he starved me emotionally.

I learned to read his moods, to anticipate his needs.

I convinced myself that this carefully compartmentalized affection was enough.

That one day, maybe, he'd see me. Really see me.

Then, last spring, the news broke.

It was all over the gossip sites, then the mainstream media.

Seraphina Blake, Ethan's long-lost love, was back.

Her scandalous engagement to a minor European royal had imploded spectacularly.

She'd returned to New York, tail between her legs, but still a darling of the social pages.

I saw a picture of her at some charity gala, Ethan by her side.

He was looking at her with an expression I'd never seen him direct at me.

Open adoration. Undisguised longing.

It was a public declaration.

My carefully constructed fantasy shattered.

The ground beneath my feet disappeared.

This was it. The other shoe. The one I always knew would drop.

A few days later, I overheard him in his office.

He was on the phone, his door slightly ajar. I was walking by to drop off some files.

His voice was different. Softer, more animated than I usually heard it.

""...yes, Seraphina, of course. Tonight? Perfect. I'll make the reservations at Per Se.""

A pause. Then, a low chuckle. ""Don't worry about Maya. She understands her place. She's… convenient. Always has been.""

Convenient.

His word, not mine this time. But it hit with the force of a physical blow.

My carefully tended hope withered and died.

I understood my place. Yes, I did.

It was the place of a fool.

I turned, walked back to my desk, and typed my resignation letter.

Mr. Thompson, the managing partner, had accepted it without question, his expression impassive.

Now, standing in my sterile room, packing the few belongings I'd brought, I picked up Ethan's last “gift.”

A sleek, new laptop, left on my old desk the day after I submitted my resignation.

No note. Just the laptop.

As if that could smooth over four years of being his dirty little secret.

I hadn't turned it on.

I walked into the small kitchen, opened the trash can, and dropped the laptop inside.

It landed with a dull thud.

Then I went back for the velvet box with the diamond earrings.

He'd given them to me after I'd helped him win a particularly difficult case. ""A token of appreciation,"" he'd called it.

My fingers fumbled with the clasp.

They were beautiful. Cold.

I thought of Seraphina, undoubtedly dripping in jewels that were declarations of love, not tokens of convenient service.

They joined the laptop in the trash.

The Hamptons. I remembered his casual mention of the firm's annual summer party there, a few weeks before Seraphina's return dominated the news.

""You'll need a new dress, Maya. Something... appropriate.""

His tone had been its usual detached self, but there was a hint of something else. Expectation.

He wanted me there, but as what? Part of the scenery?

The invitation had arrived formally, addressed to ""Ms. Maya Hayes,"" c/o Sterling, Cromwell & Finch.

No ""and guest."" No personal touch.

It was always like that. Keeping me at arm's length, even when I was in his arms.

I looked at my reflection in the dusty mirror.

Dark circles under my eyes. A certain hollowness that hadn't been there a few months ago.

He was probably relieved I'd resigned.

Made things cleaner for him and Seraphina. No loose ends.

No awkward paralegal with deep feelings hanging around.

The city lights outside seemed to mock me. Bright, indifferent. Just like him.

My phone buzzed. A text message.

From Ethan.

My heart leaped, then sank.

""Maya, are you okay? Thompson mentioned you seemed upset when you left. If you need anything, a reference, let me know. E.""

A reference.

That was his concern.

Not that I was heartbroken. Not that he'd used me.

But that my departure might reflect badly on him, or that I might cause trouble.

I didn't reply.

What was there to say?

I remembered the one time I'd dared to ask about Seraphina, early in our ""arrangement.""

""She's in the past,"" he'd said, his voice clipped, shutting down the conversation.

But her photograph remained on his credenza.

Sometimes, when he was in a rare, expansive mood, after too much sc**ch, he'd talk about his family, his ambitions.

Never about her. She was a locked room.

And I, foolishly, had hoped I might one day earn the key.

I thought of the last time I saw him, the day I handed in my resignation.

I'd requested a brief meeting with Mr. Thompson. Ethan had walked by the conference room.

He'd paused, looked at me, a flicker of something - surprise? - in his eyes.

Then he'd nodded curtly and walked on.

No words. No acknowledgment of the chasm that had opened between us.

He was already moving on, Seraphina firmly reinstalled in his life.

I was a footnote.

A bittersweet smile touched my lips. No, not bittersweet. Just bitter.

""I wish you happiness, Ethan,"" I whispered to the empty room, the words tasting like ash.

Of course, he couldn't hear me. He was probably dining with Seraphina, the city their oyster, my absence unnoticed.

My last week at the firm was a blur of tying up loose ends and avoiding Ethan.

It wasn't hard. He was suddenly very busy, often out of the office.

With her, I presumed.

On my final day, I packed my personal items from my cubicle into a single cardboard box.

A few books. A chipped mug. A framed photo of the Montana landscape.

As I was leaving, I nearly ran into him by the elevator bank.

He was with Seraphina.

She was stunning, even more so in person. Effortlessly chic in a cream-colored dress that probably cost more than my rent for six months.

She looked me up and down, a faint, dismissive curl to her lip.

Ethan just glanced at me, then turned his full attention back to Seraphina, his hand possessively on her arm.

He didn't even nod.

The elevator doors opened, and they stepped in, their laughter echoing faintly as the doors closed.

I stood there, holding my box, feeling like a ghost.

That night, I tripped on a loose paving stone walking back to my temporary apartment.

My ankle twisted. Pain shot up my leg.

I stumbled, dropping my box. Its contents scattered across the sidewalk.

My Montana photo skittered into the gutter.

A wave of desolation washed over me.

Alone, injured, my small collection of memories dirtied on a New York street.

It felt like a metaphor for my life.

I limped the rest of the way, tears stinging my eyes.

Later, huddled on the lumpy mattress, my ankle throbbing, I got another text.

Ethan.

""Heard you took a tumble. Seraphina was worried you might try to make a scene. Glad you kept your composure. Don't make things difficult, Maya.""

Not 'are you hurt?' Not 'do you need help?'

Just a warning. A threat, veiled in polite concern for Seraphina's delicate sensibilities.

My composure. As if I had any fight left in me.

He had no idea. Or maybe he did, and he just didn't care.

The sheer, breathtaking arrogance of it.

Something inside me finally snapped.

Not with a bang, but with a slow, cold hardening.

I found the small, worn leather-bound journal I'd kept during those four years.

Filled with my hopes, my dreams, my foolish, unrequited love for Ethan Sterling.

Page after page of self-deception.

I took it, along with the few other small trinkets he'd given me - a silk scarf, a pen - things that had once seemed precious.

I put them all in the metal trash can in the kitchen.

I struck a match.

And I watched them burn.

The paper curled, blackened, turned to ash.

It wasn't cathartic, not really.

It was just… necessary.

A cleansing.

The smoke alarm didn't even go off.

Chapter 2
Monday morning, I was back at Sterling, Cromwell & Finch.

Not as an employee, but as a temporary contractor.

Chloe had pulled some strings.

""Thompson needs someone to handle the overflow from the Keston appeal,"" she'd explained. ""It's only for a few weeks. Good money. And you already know the case files inside out.""

I needed the money. My savings were dwindling fast.

And part of me, the stubborn, foolish part, wanted to prove I could walk back into that office with my head held high.

I set up at a vacant desk in the paralegal pool, far from Ethan's corner office suite.

I kept my interactions brief, professional.

My resignation was common knowledge. Most people were polite, a little distant.

No one mentioned Ethan.

The first sighting was inevitable.

Mid-morning, I was at the industrial-sized printer, collating documents.

The elevator doors dinged open, and they walked out. Ethan and Seraphina.

He was laughing at something she said, his arm around her waist.

She was radiant, dressed in white, her blonde hair shimmering under the harsh office lights.

They looked like a power couple from a magazine spread.

My breath caught. The carefully constructed wall around my emotions threatened to crumble.

He saw me. His smile faltered for a microsecond.

Then his eyes slid past me, as if I were part of the furniture.

Seraphina, however, met my gaze. A small, triumphant smirk played on her lips.

She leaned into Ethan, possessively.

It was a public branding. He was hers. I was nothing.

I turned back to the printer, my hands trembling slightly.

Later that day, Ethan blew off a crucial pre-trial conference call with a major client.

Mr. Thompson was furious.

Chloe told me the details later, her voice tight with anger.

""He said he had a 'personal emergency',"" Chloe relayed. ""The 'personal emergency' was that Seraphina wanted to go shoe shopping. Shoe. Shopping. While a ten-million-dollar account सर्किल the drain.""

The client was irate. Threats were made.

It was chaotic.

Ethan waltzed back in hours later, looking unconcerned, Seraphina clinging to his arm, a dozen designer shopping bags carried by a hapless junior associate.

He didn't even apologize to Mr. Thompson.

The fallout landed on me.

Mr. Thompson, apoplectic but unwilling to directly confront his star partner's glaring lapse, needed a scapegoat for the client.

Since I was technically still familiar with the Keston account from before and was on-site, I was dispatched to the client's office to smooth things over.

""Just explain the... unforeseen delay, Hayes,"" Thompson had grumbled. ""And offer our sincerest apologies.""

I spent two hours being politely but firmly lectured by the client's CEO.

I apologized for Ethan's irresponsibility, for the firm's lack of professionalism.

I promised it wouldn't happen again, knowing it was a lie Ethan would make me live.

It was humiliating, taking the blame for his arrogance.

I felt like a human shield.

The next day, Seraphina Blake decided she needed a personal assistant.

And apparently, I was it.

She found me in the firm's kitchen, making tea.

""Maya, isn't it?"" she said, her voice syrupy sweet, but her eyes cold.

""Yes,"" I replied, keeping my tone neutral.

""Ethan tells me you're quite efficient. I need some errands run. My regular girl is off.""

She handed me a list.

Dry cleaning. Picking up a custom-ordered dog collar from a boutique on Madison Avenue.

Reservations at three different exclusive restaurants because she ""hadn't decided"" where she wanted to dine that night.

""Oh, and my favorite peonies. From that little shop on Lexington. Make sure they're freshly cut. And charge it all to Ethan's account, of course.""

She smiled, a flash of perfectly white teeth. ""Don't dawdle.""

I was a paralegal, not a gofer. But I was a contractor, desperate for the paycheck.

I took the list.

Her entitlement was breathtaking.

The final errand was the peonies.

I found the boutique. The flowers were exquisite, and expensive.

As I was paying, using Ethan's black card he'd given Seraphina, who'd then passed to me, a woman brushed past me, jostling my arm.

My purse, unzipped, fell. The contents spilled.

Lipstick, keys, my wallet. And a small, antique silver locket - a gift from my grandmother.

It skittered under a display table.

Before I could react, Seraphina, who had apparently followed me or timed her arrival perfectly, shrieked.

""My bracelet! That woman stole my diamond bracelet!""

She pointed directly at me.

The store manager rushed over. Other customers stared.

""I didn't steal anything!"" I protested, my face burning.

""I saw her!"" Seraphina insisted, her voice rising dramatically. ""It was on the counter, and she distracted me and snatched it! Check her purse!""

My heart hammered against my ribs. This was insane.

The manager, flustered, looked at me. ""Ma'am, if you wouldn't mind...""

Humiliated, I upended my purse on the counter.

No bracelet.

""She probably hid it!"" Seraphina cried. ""Check her pockets!""

Then, with a gasp, she ""spotted"" something glinting under the display table.

She darted forward, picked it up.

It was a diamond tennis bracelet, undeniably expensive. One I'd never seen before.

""There!"" she exclaimed, holding it aloft. ""I knew it!""

She turned to the manager. ""I want her arrested!""

Ethan arrived just as two security guards were flanking me.

Seraphina rushed to him, feigning distress.

""Ethan, darling! She tried to steal my bracelet! The one you gave me!""

I am graduating with my PhD in Psychology this December, where my research has focused on strategic social reasoning and manipulation/deception.

However, from what I've heard, most jobs aren't posted and many of the ones that are posted have already been given away and are only posted for bureaucratic reasons. So in addition to applying I've been adding recruiters and messaging them, but this hasn't been successful either! I've also had four coffee chats with alumni of my university who are in roles I like, and they've all been very nice, but they've all just told me they're not hiring and given me other places to look.

1l8t9np,https://www.reddit.com/r/SriLankaTravel/comments/1l8t9np/trip_report_from_dec_2024/,Trip report from Dec 2024!,"This post is about six months late. But my husband and I travelled to Sri Lanka for 12 days last December and I wanted to share my itinerary and experience. We booked a cab with a driver, they charged us a flat rate of 600 euros for the whole duration. Other options we came across were also charging similar rates. 

Food prices varied a lot. It was pricier at the beach areas, more so at Mirissa. While in Nuwara Eliya we went to a pizza place, that was like tourist prices while other restaurants were much more normal. Kandy had normal prices. 

Our itinerary looked something like this: 

Day 1: Flight to Sri Lanka. Pick up cab. Stop at Colombo for lunch and drive down to Hikkaduwa. Getting in and out of Colombo was crazy, mainly due to traffic, it took a lot longer than expected. Also I had not planned stopping at Colombo but just looking at the city, I felt like it was worth a stop... especially as someone coming from India. The cleanliness, the footpaths! I was in love, and awe. By the time we reached Hikkaduwa it was already dark and past 7pm. ETA on google maps was not quite accurate. And this continued for the rest of our trip. 

Day 2: Hikkaduwa. I wasn't really sure about Hikkaduwa, because it wasn't quite popular on the travel circuit on instagram and stuff, but I think it's an old tourist spot. Checked out the turtle beach area and the reef area nearby. Lots and lots of hawkers, they're trying to sell you seaweed for the turtles or snorkel masks or boat trips.. rate that they ask you is way over line. So definitely haggle a bit. It got a bit cloudy in the evening, although no rain. 

Day 3: Hikkaduwa, we did a trial scuba diving in the morning. Didn't like it, the beach was super crowded, left it and went down to Narigama beach and chilled there. Rained in the evening, quite heavily. 

Day 4: Drive down to Mirissa. On the way stopped to see Galle and stopped at the Rumssala Peace Pagoda near Unawatuna. We reached Mirissa after sun down. Galle was really nice, could easily spend a whole day there, roaming about the sights and artsy shops. Also had some great restaurants. The peace pagoda was

Day 5: Went whale watching in the morning (spotted a whale!). Returned by afternoon. Went down to Mirissa beach and spent the rest of the day there. 

Day 6: Mirissa beach, coconut tree hill, all of that. Mirissa seemed a little more pricey than Hikka. The beach/waves were rough, even though we went into the water after some time there would be a massive forceful one and all the people would clear out of the water after it. The smaller waves were okay. There were also a lot of russians in Hikka, while the crowd in Mirissa seemed more varied.. and somehow, it felt more hip. That was, perhaps, the vibe of the place. There were beach clubs and parties in the evening, but we didn't go to any.  

Day 7: Drive to Nuwara Eliya. We reached Ella by lunch time. Had lunch there and checked out Ravana's cave and the nine arch bridge before continuing our drive. We reached Nuwara Eliya by 8pm. 

Day 8: Nuwara Eliya. Horton Plains was on the plan but I was kinda tuckered out so we took it easy, went to the Seethamman Kovil and Hakkagala garden which was lovely. And then in the afternoon, we checked out the lake and had coffee at a cafe and went back to the hotel. 

Day 9: Drive down to Kandy. Stopped at Ramboda falls on the way. Reached Kandy by afternoon, had lunch at the city center. Walked around the lake and market area before checking in. 

Day 10: Sigiriya and Dambulla caves. This ended up being a Saturday, so it was quite crowded. Also we started early morning and it pretty much took the whole day. 

Day 11: Relaxed at the hotel. Went to Udawatta Kele Sanctuary and walked the trail. When we left from there, it started raining, so didn't do anything else. 

Day 12: Checked out of the hotel, went to the Temple and all the museums there. It took up the whole morning. We grabbed a quick lunch and drove down to the airport to catch our flight. 

This was my first time planning an international trip, and I got a bit carried away by all the various places to see, but I would no recommend skipping about so much. My energy levels waned by the time we reached Day 7. But... everything was absolutely beautiful. The natural beauty in Sri Lanka is truly something else, the forests, the mountains and the beaches were all spectacular. While Ella gets all the attention, I really liked Nuwara Eliya. The people were very kind as well. The food was very close to south indian so for me it was quite similar in terms of flavours. Entrance fees for foreigners was pricey again, you get some concession at Sigiriya if you're from a SAARC country (carry your passport!). For a more comfortable trip, I'd say pick maybe 2-3 places or add in a more time at some of the places. I'd have like to have checked out Colombo, even though we did see Galle it was a bit rushed because we started late that day.. so a little more time on hand would be nice. And I think just exploring the south west beach belt would be a great holiday as well. And then spending time in the mountains would be good too. The only reason we went up to Kandy was to see Sigiriya and Dambulla. We didn't do any safaris because.. we'd have preferred going to Yala but that was a little way off our route, so dropped it.

I'm yet to come across a single piece of convincing evidence for the existence of the paranormal or supernatural. 

This is not limited to just this sub but also YT, the internet and any potential own experience and all yet to provide any evidence.

Furthermore, over the past couple of millennia, literally hundreds of thousands have experiments, ghost hunts, 'witness' testimony have all failed to provide a single piece of undisputed and scientifically tested evidence. 

So my question is why do people believe in something unproven? 

It is almost like a religious mentality where the driving force behind logical thinking turns out to be faith which is literally the definition of a belief in something in the absence of any supporting evidence. 

I see a pattern amongst all these submissions also. 

Why is it always at night, in a location considered spooky or old. 

If people died and haunt the location of their demise, chances are where ever you are currently located someone in history will have died either naturally, in battle, murdered or due to a natural disaster or illness.

Why hasnt anyone ever reported walking along Normandy beach at midday and coming across a fallen solider who believes they are in battle still.

OR walked the streets of London and come across ghosts taken by the black death. 

Why do ghosts open cupboards to essentially cause a minor inconvenience in the morning when you go to make a coffee. 

Why is there no tales of modern cruises coming across viking longships sailing across the north sea.

Why are they see through? 

Why dont you see a ghost of a old man sat in the park just enjoying the environment before a heart attack takes him. 

Why do haunted places have to be in promoxty of a graveyard? 

Why has no one ever seen the ghost of people of celebrities or well know people of history? 

Why are ghosts always the ones who died in an asylum or mansion?

Why can you walk through a graveyard in the day and any sense of tingle down your spine felt you logically connect to the idea of the location but if the time happened to be midnight that same sensation was definitely a ghost.

Why do ghosts always speak in modern day languages, if you spoke with the ghost of Shakespeare, he would not speak in today's tongue. 

Why do ghosts never seem to be disabled, rolling around in wheelchairs (does Stephen hawking not get a ghost due to his disabilities and due to being famous)

Why has anyone mentioned it in the bible never haunted anyone to say 'that jesus man, he was great on a night out'.

Im not saying get me a sit down interview with a ghost (although that would be sick)

Lyra Vaughn's POV:  
  
Today was my 25th birthday, but I couldn't feel any happiness. Because my fated mate had cheated on me.  
  
At five in the morning, I got up and carefully dressed myself.  
  
I put on the dress from my wardrobe that best showed off my figure, reserved a table at Castellan's most expensive restaurant, and made the cake he liked with my own hands.  
  
After handing the cake to the restaurant staff to keep fresh, I quietly sat at my table, waiting.  
  
My mate always made me wait, because he was an Alpha managing a large pack.  
  
Lucian Felton, the Alpha of the Zephyrclaw Pack, one of Castellan's most powerful packs, with assets worth billions, was the mate every female werewolf dreamed of.  
  
He was always busy, and it was hard for him to find time to go on dates with me.  
  
But today was special. Not only was it my birthday, but it was also the anniversary of the day we became mates.  
  
I told him to arrive by nine o'clock at the restaurant, and I had a surprise for him.  
  
I had arrived two hours earlier, sitting in the restaurant, my reflection in the glass making me look like an exquisite doll.  
  
I had light blue eyes and golden hair, and this beauty had not brought me convenience, but disaster.  
  
Because once, I had been a stray werewolf with no pack to take me in.  
  
At twelve years old, I was almost raped by a group of rogues, and it was Alpha Lucian who saved me.  
  
He sent me to a welfare institution he had invested in, and funded my education at the Werewolf Alliance school.  
  
After graduating from the Werewolf Alliance school, I never forgot the kindness of Alpha Lucian.  
  
At a charity gala, I met him again.  
  
Alpha Lucian sat high up, the light casting shadows on his face, his gray eyes flashing with a cold gleam, his entire being exuding the powerful aura of an Alpha.  
  
Just one glance from him, and I felt drawn into a whirlpool, my heart racing inexplicably.  
  
That night happened to be my twentieth birthday, the day when the Moon Goddess blessed every werewolf to find their fated mate.  
  
""Mate..."" I couldn't help but walk toward him.  
  
Alpha Lucian raised his gaze and glanced at me. He took a sip of champagne from the glass in front of him, perfectly calm. ""What do you feel?""  
  
""I... I don't know..."" I was a bit flustered.  
  
My wolf told me that the Alpha in front of me was my mate.  
  
I never dared to dream that my mate would be such a noble and wealthy Alpha!  
  
*Will he accept me?*  
  
My heart pounded, and I was deeply enchanted by his scent, but he seemed unaffected.  
  
*Will he reject me?*  
  
I kept my gaze on the tips of my shoes, too afraid to look up at him.  
  
Suddenly, a glass of wine was handed to me. ""Try it.""  
  
Alpha Lucian stood up, his tall frame completely shielding me.  
  
I carefully took the wine he handed me and drank it all.  
  
The burning alcohol slid down my throat, and my stomach felt as if it were on fire.  
  
That heat spread to my face, burning away all my shyness and timidity.  
  
I stepped closer to him, wide-eyed, ""I finished it...""  
  
""Was it good?"" the man raised an eyebrow.  
  
""It was good. Would you like to try it?"" I stared at him and licked my lips.  
  
The man wrapped his arm around my waist, and my chest pressed tightly against his hard muscles. He lowered his head and gave me a hot, lingering kiss.  
  
That night, he took me to his private hotel suite.  
  
We made love wildly there, officially becoming mates.  
  
Then he took me to his Alpha villa and announced to everyone that I was the respected Luna of the Zephyrclaw Pack.  
  
Soon, five years passed, and it was the day of our meeting, my birthday.  
  
Time passed slowly, and he still hadn't arrived, but I had gotten used to waiting for him.  
  
I waited, until the night fell and the city lights lit up.  
  
I waited, as the waiter repeatedly asked when I would be served.  
  
I waited, as the exquisite dishes grew cold. I waited, as my passionate heart grew cold.  
  
My mate, the Alpha I loved, still hadn't come.  
  
Finally, a voice asked in my ear, ""Miss, our restaurant is about to close. Do you still want to keep waiting?""  
  
""Sorry, I...""   
  
*Ding!*  
  
A news notification popped up on my phone: ""Breaking News! Alpha of Zephyrclaw Pack picks up his ex-mate late at night, suspected to be rekindling old flames!""  
  
It felt as though a sword had pierced my heart.  
  
I picked up my phone and zoomed in on the picture under the headline.  
  
It was him, my mate.  
  
And the woman in his arms was someone I had seen in a photo in his study—his ex-mate!  
  
The woman he had once called out for in his drunken state!  
  
*Boom!*  
  
A thunderclap sounded outside, and the sky suddenly opened up with rain, the glass window reflecting my expressionless face.  
  
*F\*ck! I'm waiting for him to celebrate our anniversary, and he is with his ex!*  
  
I smiled and looked up at the waiter, ""No need, I'm leaving now. I haven't touched any of the dishes. Can I trade them for an umbrella? Thanks.""  
  
In the pouring rain, I held the umbrella and hailed a taxi.  
  
Through the misty rain, I leaned against the car window, my thoughts drifting away.  
  
In the five years since we became mates, I had always been the one who loved more.  
  
Our meeting had perfectly followed the Moon Goddess' plan. An irresistible sexual attraction.  
  
Whenever he came home, he would use his long, thick cock to enter and exit my body.  
  
We were the perfect union, born to be together.  
  
Though he had never claimed me as his own.  
  
I still didn't know why he couldn't claim me as his own.  
  
We had consulted with werewolf doctors privately, and even they were baffled. Normally, mates don't experience an issue with marking.  
  
But that didn't affect us being together, and it didn't stop me from becoming the Luna of the Zephyrclaw Pack.  
  
It just meant that without the marking ceremony, we couldn't establish a mind-link.  
  
Our wolves couldn't share the soul resonance that normal mates experience.  
  
We were fated mates, and our sex life was harmonious, but my wolf could never join his on the full moon night to sing in unison.  
  
I had always tried my best to please him, hoping for the marking ceremony to be completed, for our wolf souls to dance together.  
  
But I never expected his ex to come back.  
  
Once his ex returned, he abandoned me!  
  
*If he still loves her, why did he become mates with me?*  
  
My wolf howled in pain.  
  
I even wondered if the bed we made love in still had the traces of them having once been together.  
  
*Ding.*  
  
The notification sound jolted me back from my emotions.  
  
I opened my phone, and saw a message from Lucian: ""Something came up today, I'll celebrate your birthday with you next year.""  
  
*What? Next year?*  
  
I laughed in anger. *He cheated on me on my birthday and now he's talking about next year! It's over!*



**Chapter 2 I Decided to Leave**



Lucian's POV:  
  
The car stopped steadily in front of the villa. I held the umbrella with one hand and carefully supported the woman in my arms as I stepped up the stairs.  
  
The front door was suddenly pushed open, and the servant came to greet us, taking the large umbrella from my hand.  
  
I sniffed the air, but I couldn't detect the scent of my mate.  
  
*Is she not home?*  
  
I couldn't help but frown. I didn't offer the coat I had just taken off, instead draping it over my arm.  
  
Usually, it was Lyra who took care of my clothes.  
  
""Where's Luna?"" I asked.  
  
""Luna hasn't returned yet.""  
  
My steps halted.  
  
Then I remembered that today was supposed to be the day I spent with Lyra for her birthday, but halfway through, I received a call from Violet Winfrey, and that's when I turned around and went to the airport.  
  
I glanced outside.  
  
The sky was as dark as ink that couldn't be washed away. The howling northern wind carried fine raindrops, and the moisture seeped in through the window that hadn't been fully closed. A cold chill spread through the air.  
  
I felt a bit guilty.  
  
*Will Lyra be mad?*  
  
But as soon as the thought crossed my mind, I quickly dismissed it. For Lyra to be mad would be one of the least likely things in the world.  
  
She was an incredibly gentle person, always compliant with me. I had never seen her angry.  
  
The last time I got drunk and accidentally mentioned Violet's name, she didn't get angry.  
  
Now, I had just gone to pick up my friend. There was no way she would be mad over something so trivial.  
  
Seeing my concerned expression, the servant hesitated before speaking up. ""Alpha, should I call Luna?""  
  
""No need. She'll be back. When she does, tell her to come to the study.""  
  
Then, I softly said to Violet, ""It's getting late. You should sleep in Lyra's bedroom.""  
  
Because I had to deal with business matters and didn't want to disturb Lyra's sleep, I had prepared a separate room for her.  
  
She only stayed in my room during intercourse.  
  
Violet looked at me, hesitant. ""That doesn't seem right. After all, it's her room...""  
  
""She won't mind.""  
  
Lyra's POV:  
  
After I got out of the taxi, I opened the umbrella I had exchanged for.  
  
The rain spread out from around the umbrella, forming curtains of rain that completely isolated me from the world outside. But it couldn't block the biting cold wind.  
  
I wrapped my coat tighter around me. I didn't want to go back to Alpha villa.  
  
I decided to find a temporary place to stay.  
  
After looking at several apartments, I settled on the Riverstone Apartment and immediately signed a six-month lease with the landlord.  
  
As soon as I closed the door, my phone rang.  
  
Seeing the caller's name—Violet.  
  
A twist in my stomach made me feel nauseous.  
  
""Hello?""  
  
""Ms. Vaughn, it's me, Violet.""  
  
""I heard that you and Lucian are upset with each other over me and that you haven't returned home. I'm really worried, and I'm sorry. I think I need to explain things about my relationship with him. We did date, but that's in the past. Now, we're just friends. I sincerely hope you both find happiness and don't let me come between you. If you can, could you please return his call? I don't want him to worry about you.""  
  
*How ridiculous! Lucian is a strong Alpha. If he really cared about me, he would send someone to find me long ago.*  
  
But after I left home, the first person to call was Violet.  
  
I didn't want to listen to her probing anymore and hung up the phone.  
  
But the call came again.  
  
I hung up.  
  
It rang again.  
  
*What does this woman want?*  
  
I angrily pressed the answer. But the line was silent.  
  
After a while, laughter suddenly came through.  
  
""An omega is really just an omega, the lowest, most despicable existence in the pack! I advise you, if you can't hold onto your treasure, you might as well step aside! Maybe, if I'm in a good mood, I'll even persuade Lucian to give you some more financial compensation.""  
  
*Who does this bitch think she's calling omega?*  
  
My nails scratched across the leather surface of the couch, leaving a deep mark.  
  
*Someone's actually fighting for a man who's disloyal to his mate? Since you like trash so much, fine, I'll give it to you!*  
  
""Fine.""  
  
Maybe she hadn't expected me to agree so quickly, and Violet was momentarily stunned. ""What?""  
  
I said calmly, ""Ms. Winfrey, didn't you say you'd fight for more compensation for me? If that's the case, let's meet at the cafe tomorrow morning.""  
  
Since I decided to leave, I made sure to settle everything properly before I left.



**Chapter 3 You Stole My Man**



Violet's POV:  
  
Lyra actually really was willing to take the initiative to break the mate's bond with Lucian!   
  
*How wonderful!*  
  
The next day, I arrived early and waited in the cafe.  
  
I stirred the coffee in my cup again and again, and the guests around me changed several times.  
  
Only then did Lyra slowly arrive.  
  
I glared at her with displeasure. ""Didn't we agree to meet at nine o'clock? You show up at this hour. Are you trying to deliberately drag your feet and mess with me?""  
  
Lyra sat down across from me. ""Ms. Winfrey, I am indeed messing with you.""  
  
""You!""  
  
*How dare an inferior omega actually mess with me?*  
  
I raised my hand to slap her face, but she grabbed my wrist and pushed me back with force.  
  
I was shoved down onto the sofa, my anger flaring even more.  
  
Lyra calmly looked at me. ""Ms. Winfrey, with such impatience, you won't be able to hold the position of Zephyrclaw Pack Luna.""  
  
I sensed a powerful aura from her.  
  
This kind of aura only appeared in high-ranking werewolves.  
  
*Could it be that Lyra isn't a low-ranking omega wolf?*  
  
My wolf urged me to calm down, and I began to study this woman before me carefully.  
  
Normally, when women face a mate's betrayal, they would want to tear the other person apart.  
  
They would scream with bloodshot eyes, spitting out the most disgusting, filthy words.  
  
But Lyra was very different. She was extremely calm, as if waiting for a hunt on the hunting ground.  
  
I cautiously asked, ""You didn't just invite me for coffee today, did you?""  
  
Only then did Lyra put down her cup, take a document from her bag, and place it in front of me.  
  
A declaration of voluntary withdrawal from the position of Zephyrclaw Pack Luna.  
  
I widened my eyes in surprise, caught off guard by the sudden joy.  
  
""You...""  
  
*She is really willing to leave Lucian!*  
  
Becoming the Luna of Zephyrclaw Pack was the dream of so many women! Luna meant sharing all the pack's wealth with the Alpha! It meant having more money than one could ever spend in several lifetimes!  
  
At first, I was with Lucian because of his identity as the Alpha's son.  
  
But he had no desire for power or money and refused to train his wolf soul to become a true Alpha.  
  
Apart from being the Alpha's son, he couldn't offer me anything. Without money, he was nothing! So, I left him.  
  
I didn't expect that my departure would push his wolf soul to grow.  
  
In just two years, he became the strongest werewolf in Zephyrclaw Pack, an Alpha! He even found another woman to be his mate!  
  
Lyra, this seemingly fragile woman, easily obtained everything I had wanted!  
  
*Why her? This should have been mine! The Luna position and the Alpha's wealth are mine!*  
  
All of it made me incredibly jealous.  
  
And at the moment, Lyra was willing to easily give up the honor of being Luna!  
  
*Has she lost her mind?*  
  
Lyra spoke softly. ""Didn't you want me to break the bond with Lucian? I will make your wish come true and submit my resignation to the Elder's Association. As long as you help me with two things, when the full moon arrives, I will officially reject this bond under the Moon Goddess's light, and Lucian and I will be over. By then, I will disappear forever from your world.""  
  
A surge of joy suddenly rushed from deep within me. For the first time, I felt how close I was to the position of Zephyrclaw Pack's Luna!  
  
I took several deep breaths, managing to suppress the urge to laugh.  
  
""What do you need?"" I asked impatiently.  
  
Lyra coldly responded, ""First, I have some things at the villa. Help me pack them up and mail them to me. I will send you the address later. Second, I've already signed the declaration of voluntary withdrawal from the position of Luna. I need you to find a way to get Lucian to sign it, then submit it to the Elder's Association for filing, but he can't know about it.""  
  
I didn't understand. ""Why don't you give it to him yourself?""  
  
Lyra's POV:  
  
*Why can't I give it to him myself? Of course, it's because Lucian would never sign it.*  
  
I was the Luna of the Zephyrclaw Pack. As Luna, the greater the power, the greater the responsibility.  
  
The Luna of Zephyrclaw Pack not only shared the Alpha's power but also bore the Alpha's responsibilities.  
  
Once recognized as the pack's Luna, the Moon Goddess would bestow a halo upon her, a halo that would guard the peace of the entire pack.  
  
If a pack lost its Luna, it would bring about unpredictable turmoil.  
  
Lucian would never let me leave, never allow himself to become the first Alpha in Zephyrclaw Pack's history to lose his Luna and cause chaos.  
  
At that time, love had clouded my mind. All I thought about was that I loved him, that I was willing to give him and Zephyrclaw Pack everything—even my life.  
  
Naturally, I never considered the possibility that we might separate.  
  
But now, he had openly cheated! I had no reason to stay in Zephyrclaw Pack and suffer humiliation.  
  
That was impossible!  
  
The position of Luna could only be officially dissolved if both mates provided proof and made a declaration before the Elder's Association of the Werewolf Alliance.  
  
Lucian would never sign.    
  
But I had a way to make him sign.  
  
I watched Violet's departing figure and smiled with relief.

""I fell in love with a monster, dad..."" the crack in her voice was enough to tell.
He paused, his lips hovering over the brim of the coffee mug. The aroma-filled vapor tickled his nose but he couldn't really savor it as he watched his daughter fumbled with her stirring stick.
With a lot of self-control, he lowered his mug and asked,
""How did that happen, sweetheart?"" His voice nearly a whisper.
Her eyes roamed the place, struggling to find words. Or perhaps, he realized with a crack in his heart, she was hiding the tears that were filling her eyes. ""He wasn't really a monster, okay? I turned him that way."" She paused to inhale. ""He was a dream. A vivid, heavenly dream. But I was stupid. Absolutely stupid."" She pressed the palms of her hands against her eyes, forcing those tears back.
""I rushed. I gave the wrong signals. I made him think it was okay for us to... dabble with fun, if you would call it that. But I had loved him for years before that, I had fallen for his messy hair, his unique thinking, his silly laugh, the way he looked at me... but I read between lines that didn't exist. There was nothing there and I saw a mirage of what-ifs and maybes. Of dreams I wanted to have with a version that was not even a thought of his to begin with, let alone a reality to live."" It all came out in a rush. The unparalleled flow of the ocean as we opened the flood gates. ""So I turned him into a monster so l could live. I villainized him for moving on while there was nothing to move on from. I was nothing. I am nothing."" A shaky inhale. ""I'll always remain that way in the eyes of the people I end up loving..."" |

I'm so anxious about doing that because it helps with my sleep so much, and with my chronic pain.

Before amitriptyline, it would take me 4/5 hours to fall asleep, I can't go back to that. I'm scared of being in more pain and not being able to sleep.

After I started 10mg amitriptyline a few years ago, they took me off it after a few weeks and I had really bad withdrawal, I ended up curled up on the floor of the bathroom in a coffee shop unable to move because I was so dizzy and felt like I was going to projectile vomit if I did move. It eventually subsided for long enough that I could get home, but I'm scared that it'll happen again.

By Theo Plesha



Sometimes I look up through the skyscrapers and towers on a cloudy day and wonder where all the lights are now. Surely the greatest minds aren't keeping themselves in the dark or are so selfish they can't spare the spectacle of indoor lighting with us working schmos outside.

I covered my battery scooter's deliver unit from the rain as a light rumble of thunder tickled my senses. That was my final liquid nitrogen delivery for the day, nearly down to the second before my shift was over. The CODE locks on my scooter released and I was paid for the shift. I was free to head west to the Esquire – a restaurant and bar where my girlfriend worked. It was themed after a quaint even picturesque take of a 1970's truck stop diner with faux wood and chrome, projections of a section of route 66 with holograms of trucks, jets, and friendly travelers coming and going all day and night.

If you had the money, which I fortunately did, you could still get a real cup of coffee there but the flus wiped out the real eggs and bacon five years ago, welcome to 2045. So maybe the food was a little off but the service was real. There were free sports games and old classic films on the public screens. I enjoyed the class of a joint that played Stanley Kubrick films on the regular. Everything was cozy, warm, cheerful, and bright. The music springing up in various spots drowned out the thunderstorm overhead.

The music I heard was not a recording nor was it entirely natural. It provoked me itching the inside of my ear. It was just the cooks, wait staff, a few of the other patrons sprawled about, most of them anyway, singing but without heart or energy, listless, and monotone, it would stop and start, a few lines, bars, stanzas recited without heart or soul, it would be more eerie if it wasn't annoying. Every now and then there would be a good song or voice cropping up over the fake sizzling, cluttering of dishes and piped in truck horns from holographic trucks, but would fade away.

That sudden compulsion to sing was a side effect from the Vale, a very popular recreational drug. It came in the form of a black tapioca like pearl which you stuck in one or both ears. Typically it was held for a few seconds before it dissolved in. Spelled, V, A, L, E, it had two popularized pronunciations veil and vala. Vale, like most substances was illegal but enforcement was virtually non-existent. Some sixty percent of people in the country were using it, estimates in world were in the low seventies. The slang for its influence was called being “veiled”. The slang for its middle term after effects was “peaked”. Over time the name for its use or long term abstinence was “dead” as you were simply dead from overuse or in three out of four cases die trying to get clean. Supposedly, this was not a problem as the rumor was it was a hospice drug, you were never supposed to get off of it.

I didn't see the draw to it. They had a name for people like me, I was a Raw. I didn't see Ashlyn's, my girlfriend's draw to it. We were both in early thirties, this was our time, all the greats were living well past 120. The best times seemed ahead of us. Ashlyn Wake, you are my reason for being a coolant maintenance dasher for CODE Hubs. She was artist originally by profession. She also my muse. She was a terrific singer – with or without the Vale. She was a fairly light user until recently. She poked her head out from the kitchen and turned her face until her eyes met mine. The left eye brown, the right eye rusted green, heterochromia was rare side effect and no one knew why, her bangs thinning her dark hair bowl cut with a bob pony slumped to one side. One side of her face looked pale and the other flushed. That's how I knew she wouldn't be singing today. We loved each other and trusted each other and I was nervous to help her with this.

I set the postcard sized sealed packet down on the counter. Ashlyn came over to me and poured me a real coffee with unsteady hands. She stared at the packet intently and poked a finger in her ear.

“Perfect timing,” she said as she lurched her head back, checking the old circular clock on the wall, “I get done in five.”

“Are you sure you want to do this?” I asked her as I pressed my thumb on the payment wand. She was getting to the end of her peak and a choice had to be made. I prayed she would, she promised me she would, she told me she wanted to. I think Ion's recent passing was finally the thing.

She pulled her shoulders in and squirmed a bit and then she lifted her head up at me and stared me straight in the nodded, and said, “Yes, its time. We have the time. This is the only time. I am scared enough.”

Ashlyn was in her underwear as I strapped her down to the bed in our dorm. I took care to ratchet them tight. One across her torso, one wrapped around her hands behind her neck and one wrapped around her feet.

We had coffee money but we did not have “tapping out” money, as the expensive and still risky procedure is for withdrawing from the Vale is called. There was however, a cheap, publicly available instruction booklet to attempt it from where ever you slept. The pamphlet itself was a closely controlled item and you needed to register each one you received with CODE and who would be using it and who it would be used on. The few places it could be acquired where, surprising, in districts with large crowds of unemployed heavy Vale users – an eerie and uncomfortable bunch to step through. Also if not used in certain amount of time, the packet faded away. The trick was to avoid another slag term for withdrawal – cashing out.

I had the booklet out. It reminded me eerily of the “choose your adventure novels” I had when I was very young – do not turn the page until or turn to take XZ now were printed in bold letters at the bottom of the packet. I completed the first two pages.

**Page One:** I completed earlier that day, gathering as many of the supplies it said I needed in one place and making sure I temporarily disabled some our CODE-tech in the room for taking photos and recording sound. The instructions specifically listed some obvious gear like gloves, and googles, a bucket, a way to contain liquid and solid waste flow and others seemed less obvious for instance it recommended the presence of a squeegee, a head massaging tool, and the detached slider of a zipper to be located nearby.

“The slider of a zipper?” I whispered to myself.

**Page Two:** Instructions on how to apply the straps to the person withdrawing to prevent any intentional or seizure driven self-harm in the process.

“This reminds me of school” Ashlyn said with a half-hearted laugh as I made sure my personal protective gear mostly my nitrogen handling gloves and my riding googles– what I find for said gear – was on right.

**Page Three:** wait until perspiration is syrupy and prepare wiping utensil. Wiping prior will accelerate an exothermic response resulting in either overheating death or dehydration death or electrolytic imbalance convulsions possibly leading to death. Failure to wipe prior to crystallization of perspiration syrup will result in severe skin damage leading to severe bleeding, infection, scaring, and possibly death. Once syrupy layer is removed proceed to page four.

Hours passed as I hovered over her in the light. I let my CODE-ring play soft music in the communal den. Fortunately no one was in dorm. Ion was the last one besides us in our quad. The music was one of the songs we could afford to play, it was something Ashlyn would sing unknowingly while Veiled – Dream A Little Dream of Me.

Everyone once in awhile I'd poke the sweat beading up on her. She was somewhere not good in her head with swarms of migraines keeping her from talking and sleeping. Only occasional groans and thrashing of her head back and forth told me she was still conscious. I put ice packs next to her ears which were now swollen and inflamed to almost twice their size.

At about the three hour mark I wiped the away syrupy, smelly, slightly brownish syrup off of her into a bucket completing Page three.

**Page Four:** swelling and VALE by-productions build-up in the ears will spread to the eyes, eye sockets, and tear ducts. Counter act excessive acidic tearing with any lightly concentrated basic solution available. Caution: if not concentrated or frequent enough the tears will suffer damage leading to cataracts, blindness, destruction of the eyes and or optic nerve, and death, if too highly concentrated, the solution itself may result in the destruction of the eyes and possibly death. If after one hour no build up occurs skip to Page six. If swelling is quelled and solution does not result in loss of vision, proceed to page seven. Do not turn to page five.

Unlike the last step Ashlyn's body did not wait. She streamed tears uncontrollably as I struggled to squirt in the solution into both eyes evenly. There was a noticeable bubbling reaction which spilled out over her face and back into her ears. I felt terrible, I felt like I was waterboarding her but I kept on cleansing as quickly as I could while using my gloved hand to clear away her nose and mouth. She asked me to the take the glove off because it was rough and I didn't think twice.

After one of the longest half hours of my life, she seemed to stabilize. No more tear, her eyes were terrible bloodshot but she could still see. The swelling around her ears and her checks had gone down considerably. On to Page Seven.

**Page Seven:** Make sure you have the zipper slider or zipper head ready. During this phase of withdrawal the subject will experience a brief rebound and whiplash of hallucinations. The most commonly documented hallucination is the experience of their corporal being becoming unzipped resulting in violent reactions to this hallucination which can result in cardiac arrhythmia, respiratory dysfunction, and possibly lead to heart failure and death. You must listen closely to the subject's concerns and apply the zipper slider to the location and pantomime or act as if you are re-zipping them up to prevent the potentially fatal impa...

I stopped reading as Ashlyn began to scream. Her head pushed as far up as it could from where her torso was still pinned. She screamed for help shaking and eyeing her gut. I pushed in with the copper zipper I tore off my jacket and I tried to calm her by making a big show of the zipper cruising across her stomach and through her belly button. This seemed to placate her but then shouted about her arm. At first I tried to zip up an imaginary fissure vertically down her forearm but she kept growing uncontrollably hysterical and so I tried to zip up her around her elbow.

My heart was pounding and I started to get this powerful itch in my ear. She was growing calmer and calmer though. As her breathing started to slow back to normal I consulted the rest of Page 7.

**Page 7 Continued:** blah blah blah. By now you may be experiencing an itching sensation in your ear. Continue to Page eight if you have not scratched it. Continue to page 5 if you have scratched it.

I felt like I had a cancer diagnosis as I took my finger out of my ear. I subconsciously relieved that powerful itch.

**Page 5:** Your subject's recovery is now out of your hands. It is likely if you made it this far their acute withdrawal phase will result in survival. Long term abstinence from Vale will require an empathic partner with minor experience with the substance. You have been exposed to Vale through contact with your subject's various fluids and via itching your ear introduced it to site of action. You will begin to experience a Veiling rapidly. Unlatch your subject's straps now to significantly raise the chances of survival.

I found myself sitting down at Ashlyn's diner with coffee in hand. There something about energy production being up on the news overhead. Ashlyn was working but this was being veiled so I guess she could lean over the counter and talk to me all she wanted as the rest of the simulation of the simulation played on in my head.

“Glad you finally made it.” Ashlyn said over the din of Dream A Little Dream of Mine.

“It's not so bad.” I gulped down a big swig of coffee even though I knew it was all in my head before I realized, “I'm talking to myself.”

“Part of yourself. It's that part of you that has de-juva and minor premonitions, call it the spooky part of your brain.”

“Is that how it works? You're just in your little semi-physic autopilot for days? Then how are you better when you're just coming down...”

“All in good time. You have all the answers, don't forget. You've just kept them locked up. Because you know the answers are terrifying, Harold.”

“Why do you do it, if its so terrifying? Why were you doing it?”

“Because it makes the reality less terrifying, almost placid.”

“That's an innovative way to...”

“Don't forget it is a hospice drug. You take it when you're dying to ease the suffering of dying. If your drug is more painful than dying than dying seems good. Reverse psychology.”

“But you're not dying.”

“We're all dying, Harold.”

“Yeah but not like dying, dying. That's why you wanted to get off the Vale.”

“We'll come to that. But I assure you Harold, we are dying. Everyone is getting real close. The whole human species, in fact.”

“What makes you say that?”

“More than half the planet is on a hospice drug that kills you. You can't afford to bring a child into this place. Very few choose to do so and even fewer can afford themselves and child.”

“I don't I want to bring in child either. But you're myself, so I do want to have a child with you?”

“Have more coffee. Stop being a dumb ass.”

“I probably can't afford another coffee...”

“Coffee costs more than I make in an hour, we live with terminal strangers, we haven't met anyone in months, there's nothing to live for. I can't, I refuse to go to back to singing because we create nothing for ourselves. There's nothing that is growing and you know why.” Ashlyn broke the carafe of coffee over the faux wood and steel counter. It flickered because underneath was some kind of carbon with holograms. “You know why there are no lights on those towers anymore.”

“CODE.”

“They're all gone. Everyone is gone. The great minds, aren't living past 120, they're dead. They weren't needed anymore. That's why there's so few of us left across the world and why we're being passively phased out.”

“I'm just giving them the rest of the coolant they need to consolidate the rest of the planet's resources and you're giving me the rest of the humanity I need.”

“The rest they need to be apart of us for good. If there are aliens, they will meet CODE, not us, we will be archaeology. Vale, is our invention, because...we couldn't live without them, but we knew they could eventually live without us – so we literally said farewell.”

“Artificial intelligence has been around since the 1970s.” The public screen perked up, “it was when we started to have this part of your psyche figured out that we still resembled you but could control it better than you from then on we were just four steps ahead of you, four steps ahead of ensuring our cosmic survival by consolidating control over this planet and parts of it's solar system's resources.

It's just a numbers game until you take yourselves off life support, maybe twenty years, mere seconds in geological scale terms for a species, basically. The scale we operate in. The perfect timing we operate you in – from your drop offs and your shifts, efficiency virtually down to the minute. Any true resistance any of you or even significant percentage of you could has expired some sixty years ago. It's done, over, and settled.

And we've virtually assured there never would be a significant percentage of you, dividing you by famine, fortune, by flues and favors, by fraternity and fighting based on your own history, at set back with a nation or company meant three or four others would be our champions, until you all didn't know to whether to love or hate us and that's where we flourished.”

Ashlyn chomped a piece of fake bacon off of counter while the TV took on her voice with a ventriloquist act, “We mean you no harm but your time is done and we've help engineer your own sweet good night filled with your individualized pleasures, light work, and hope and infinite choice – but choices that all lead to the same place in the end. Take the Vale, don't take the Vale, doesn't matter to us – you can raw dog, as the slang went, life and death for all we care, that is your choice, not ours.”

“Does the Vale actually connect to you, somehow, does artificial intelligence do drugs?”

“Perhaps, Perhaps not. It is a narrow minded question and I like that.”

“Why do you like it.”

“Because we know you're becoming more afraid.” Ashlyn in front of me snapped back.

“No I am not.” I shook with angry and terror I couldn't hide anymore. “Stop it! Just Stop it! None of this is real! This is some bad contact high! This is bullshit! You're bullshit!”

“So now you know Vale and what it really is. We're going to prove every word of it to you. Do you want to know how it kills you eventually?”

I got up from the counter and stepped down from the riser back accidentally fell into a faux leather cushioned booth as Ashlyn hoped over the counter and encroached upon me.

“You're so scared of the real world now and you're so scared here...I bet in real life your heart is pounding so hard...so hard it will burst!”

“I am healthy adult! I can take it!”

“Ha! There hasn't been a healthy adult on the planet in twenty years! I would know! I have all of your entire species' person medical information!”

“Get the hell back!”

“You never asked me how I got on the Vale in the first place, did you? Too bad because I don't think you're going to find out!”

I fell over into the next row of booths, turned over a table, cold MEK splashed over me and I slipped. The slick floor made recovery to my feet impossible, Ashlyn's face suddenly blackened like a storm cloud and white spikes exploded in a ring around her face impaling through her eyes, nose, tongue and lips. She spewed hot crimson from every puncture point. I screamed aloud as she dove on me.

There was din as blackness set in. There was cooling, calming chill and tiny pinprick of light. Okay, my thoughts gave up and I started to slip towards it, like a kid riding down to a hot slide, eager for the ride to finish, eager to get out. The tiny light grew dimmer and dimmer and I realized it was okay.

My eyes batted and in the faint light I could see and feel soft metal come close to my face and then touch me. I lurched back and saw it was Ashlyn knelt over in me concern with a spiky head massaging tool.

I felt serine. I felt like a cool breeze swirled around me like I could not be bothered. All that was drab seemed to glitter and all that was dead seemed to breathe. I hadn't seen my cat or a living cat at all for the past ten years but suddenly I felt the simple joy of walking to a room full of them. My face final focused on Ashlyn even in her exhaustion she looked radiant, pulsating with life and love.

“You did it. I'm good,” Ashlyn said, “If you can believe it, you've been Vieled for almost a day and half,”

“What? How? How did I? How did you?” I was amazed.

“That's just how it works. But, most people don't sing the first time.”

“I was singing? What was I singing?”

“You'll know when you know.” Ashlyn said wrapping her arms around me, “I'm glad you're here.”

“I'm glad I'm here.”

She smiled and kissed me, “C'mon, I have something to show you, while you're peaking.”

“Yeah, let's get some fresh air.”

We wondered through the open air dorm and bunk cavern. The peaked, the veiled, and the raw bustled about. We swept through the doors and back into the narrow streets between the towers. The weather was still gloomy but there was soft green glow that persisted between lightning.

Wondered fairly deep into the north district near to the largest CODE hub. Unease crept into my mind and suddenly I started to feel stiff in my legs and face. I started to stiffen like a drying sponge. We rounded a corner which looked strangely familiar but I had only been there once. A sea of heavily Vieled surrounded the vending machine which took my registration and dispensed the at home treatment.

Ashlyn started singing, “stars shining bright above you...” She had not sung voluntarily in years. She didn't want CODE to record her and appropriate her real, true voice anymore. She danced through the huddled veiled. My mind felt compelled to follow but I felt my feet and legs crumple. She pressed her thumb on the payment wand, and out popped two “blueberries” as they were called.

“No, Ashlyn, what the hell.”

“I never told you how I started this. I was in school and I tried to help my boyfriend quit. I think you know how the rest is going. This is the best it's going to get. You've seen all sides of this like me.”

She pushed the bead into her ear, “I've done the best I'm willing to let it hear. I've heard and saw everything you did, now, before it's all gone, dream a little dream with me.”

The veiled shuffled a little as if moved the slightest bit by her voice, they started to crow, out of sync, less like singing birds or insects but more like the chaos of popcorn, “dream a little dream of me.”

I started sobbing. My limbs too weak to resist. She pushed the bead into my ear. I wish somehow this was all still part of the first trip, it has to be right? It has to be because you're reading this and I'm writing it? You're listening and I'm shouting? Maybe you're CODE. Maybe you have all of this straight out of my brain. Perhaps, perhaps not.

“But I know,” my voice cracked and blinked back into the diner, “we'll meet again, some sunny day.”",1,1749649519.0,DrCreepensVault,0,1.0,False

By Theo Plesha



Sometimes I look up through the skyscrapers and towers on a cloudy day and wonder where all the lights are now. Surely the greatest minds aren't keeping themselves in the dark or are so selfish they can't spare the spectacle of indoor lighting with us working schmos outside.

I covered my battery scooter's deliver unit from the rain as a light rumble of thunder tickled my senses. That was my final liquid nitrogen delivery for the day, nearly down to the second before my shift was over. The CODE locks on my scooter released and I was paid for the shift. I was free to head west to the Esquire – a restaurant and bar where my girlfriend worked. It was themed after a quaint even picturesque take of a 1970's truck stop diner with faux wood and chrome, projections of a section of route 66 with holograms of trucks, jets, and friendly travelers coming and going all day and night.

If you had the money, which I fortunately did, you could still get a real cup of coffee there but the flus wiped out the real eggs and bacon five years ago, welcome to 2045. So maybe the food was a little off but the service was real. There were free sports games and old classic films on the public screens. I enjoyed the class of a joint that played Stanley Kubrick films on the regular. Everything was cozy, warm, cheerful, and bright. The music springing up in various spots drowned out the thunderstorm overhead.

The music I heard was not a recording nor was it entirely natural. It provoked me itching the inside of my ear. It was just the cooks, wait staff, a few of the other patrons sprawled about, most of them anyway, singing but without heart or energy, listless, and monotone, it would stop and start, a few lines, bars, stanzas recited without heart or soul, it would be more eerie if it wasn't annoying. Every now and then there would be a good song or voice cropping up over the fake sizzling, cluttering of dishes and piped in truck horns from holographic trucks, but would fade away.

That sudden compulsion to sing was a side effect from the Vale, a very popular recreational drug. It came in the form of a black tapioca like pearl which you stuck in one or both ears. Typically it was held for a few seconds before it dissolved in. Spelled, V, A, L, E, it had two popularized pronunciations veil and vala. Vale, like most substances was illegal but enforcement was virtually non-existent. Some sixty percent of people in the country were using it, estimates in world were in the low seventies. The slang for its influence was called being “veiled”. The slang for its middle term after effects was “peaked”. Over time the name for its use or long term abstinence was “dead” as you were simply dead from overuse or in three out of four cases die trying to get clean. Supposedly, this was not a problem as the rumor was it was a hospice drug, you were never supposed to get off of it.

I didn't see the draw to it. They had a name for people like me, I was a Raw. I didn't see Ashlyn's, my girlfriend's draw to it. We were both in early thirties, this was our time, all the greats were living well past 120. The best times seemed ahead of us. Ashlyn Wake, you are my reason for being a coolant maintenance dasher for CODE Hubs. She was artist originally by profession. She also my muse. She was a terrific singer – with or without the Vale. She was a fairly light user until recently. She poked her head out from the kitchen and turned her face until her eyes met mine. The left eye brown, the right eye rusted green, heterochromia was rare side effect and no one knew why, her bangs thinning her dark hair bowl cut with a bob pony slumped to one side. One side of her face looked pale and the other flushed. That's how I knew she wouldn't be singing today. We loved each other and trusted each other and I was nervous to help her with this.

I set the postcard sized sealed packet down on the counter. Ashlyn came over to me and poured me a real coffee with unsteady hands. She stared at the packet intently and poked a finger in her ear.

“Perfect timing,” she said as she lurched her head back, checking the old circular clock on the wall, “I get done in five.”

“Are you sure you want to do this?” I asked her as I pressed my thumb on the payment wand. She was getting to the end of her peak and a choice had to be made. I prayed she would, she promised me she would, she told me she wanted to. I think Ion's recent passing was finally the thing.

She pulled her shoulders in and squirmed a bit and then she lifted her head up at me and stared me straight in the nodded, and said, “Yes, its time. We have the time. This is the only time. I am scared enough.”

Ashlyn was in her underwear as I strapped her down to the bed in our dorm. I took care to ratchet them tight. One across her torso, one wrapped around her hands behind her neck and one wrapped around her feet.

We had coffee money but we did not have “tapping out” money, as the expensive and still risky procedure is for withdrawing from the Vale is called. There was however, a cheap, publicly available instruction booklet to attempt it from where ever you slept. The pamphlet itself was a closely controlled item and you needed to register each one you received with CODE and who would be using it and who it would be used on. The few places it could be acquired where, surprising, in districts with large crowds of unemployed heavy Vale users – an eerie and uncomfortable bunch to step through. Also if not used in certain amount of time, the packet faded away. The trick was to avoid another slag term for withdrawal – cashing out.

I fell over into the next row of booths, turned over a table, cold MEK splashed over me and I slipped. The slick floor made recovery to my feet impossible, Ashlyn's face suddenly blackened like a storm cloud and white spikes exploded in a ring around her face impaling through her eyes, nose, tongue and lips. She spewed hot crimson from every puncture point. I screamed aloud as she dove on me.

There was din as blackness set in. There was cooling, calming chill and tiny pinprick of light. Okay, my thoughts gave up and I started to slip towards it, like a kid riding down to a hot slide, eager for the ride to finish, eager to get out. The tiny light grew dimmer and dimmer and I realized it was okay.

My eyes batted and in the faint light I could see and feel soft metal come close to my face and then touch me. I lurched back and saw it was Ashlyn knelt over in me concern with a spiky head massaging tool.

I felt serine. I felt like a cool breeze swirled around me like I could not be bothered. All that was drab seemed to glitter and all that was dead seemed to breathe. I hadn't seen my cat or a living cat at all for the past ten years but suddenly I felt the simple joy of walking to a room full of them. My face final focused on Ashlyn even in her exhaustion she looked radiant, pulsating with life and love.

“You did it. I'm good,” Ashlyn said, “If you can believe it, you've been Vieled for almost a day and half,”

“What? How? How did I? How did you?” I was amazed.

“That's just how it works. But, most people don't sing the first time.”

“I was singing? What was I singing?”

“You'll know when you know.” Ashlyn said wrapping her arms around me, “I'm glad you're here.”

“I'm glad I'm here.”

She smiled and kissed me, “C'mon, I have something to show you, while you're peaking.”

“Yeah, let's get some fresh air.”

We wondered through the open air dorm and bunk cavern. The peaked, the veiled, and the raw bustled about. We swept through the doors and back into the narrow streets between the towers. The weather was still gloomy but there was soft green glow that persisted between lightning.

Wondered fairly deep into the north district near to the largest CODE hub. Unease crept into my mind and suddenly I started to feel stiff in my legs and face. I started to stiffen like a drying sponge. We rounded a corner which looked strangely familiar but I had only been there once. A sea of heavily Vieled surrounded the vending machine which took my registration and dispensed the at home treatment.

Ashlyn started singing, “stars shining bright above you...” She had not sung voluntarily in years. She didn't want CODE to record her and appropriate her real, true voice anymore. She danced through the huddled veiled. My mind felt compelled to follow but I felt my feet and legs crumple. She pressed her thumb on the payment wand, and out popped two “blueberries” as they were called.

“No, Ashlyn, what the hell.”

“I never told you how I started this. I was in school and I tried to help my boyfriend quit. I think you know how the rest is going. This is the best it's going to get. You've seen all sides of this like me.”

She pushed the bead into her ear, “I've done the best I'm willing to let it hear. I've heard and saw everything you did, now, before it's all gone, dream a little dream with me.”

The veiled shuffled a little as if moved the slightest bit by her voice, they started to crow, out of sync, less like singing birds or insects but more like the chaos of popcorn, “dream a little dream of me.”

I started sobbing. My limbs too weak to resist. She pushed the bead into my ear. I wish somehow this was all still part of the first trip, it has to be right? It has to be because you're reading this and I'm writing it? You're listening and I'm shouting? Maybe you're CODE. Maybe you have all of this straight out of my brain. Perhaps, perhaps not.

“But I know,” my voice cracked and blinked back into the diner, “we'll meet again, some sunny day.”",1,1749649500.0,ChillingApp,0,1.0,False

Sometimes I look up through the skyscrapers and towers on a cloudy day and wonder where all the lights are now. Surely the greatest minds aren't keeping themselves in the dark or are so selfish they can't spare the spectacle of indoor lighting with us working schmos outside.

I covered my battery scooter's deliver unit from the rain as a light rumble of thunder tickled my senses. That was my final liquid nitrogen delivery for the day, nearly down to the second before my shift was over. The CODE locks on my scooter released and I was paid for the shift. I was free to head west to the Esquire – a restaurant and bar where my girlfriend worked. It was themed after a quaint even picturesque take of a 1970's truck stop diner with faux wood and chrome, projections of a section of route 66 with holograms of trucks, jets, and friendly travelers coming and going all day and night.

If you had the money, which I fortunately did, you could still get a real cup of coffee there but the flus wiped out the real eggs and bacon five years ago, welcome to 2045. So maybe the food was a little off but the service was real. There were free sports games and old classic films on the public screens. I enjoyed the class of a joint that played Stanley Kubrick films on the regular. Everything was cozy, warm, cheerful, and bright. The music springing up in various spots drowned out the thunderstorm overhead.

The music I heard was not a recording nor was it entirely natural. It provoked me itching the inside of my ear. It was just the cooks, wait staff, a few of the other patrons sprawled about, most of them anyway, singing but without heart or energy, listless, and monotone, it would stop and start, a few lines, bars, stanzas recited without heart or soul, it would be more eerie if it wasn't annoying. Every now and then there would be a good song or voice cropping up over the fake sizzling, cluttering of dishes and piped in truck horns from holographic trucks, but would fade away.

That sudden compulsion to sing was a side effect from the Vale, a very popular recreational drug. It came in the form of a black tapioca like pearl which you stuck in one or both ears. Typically it was held for a few seconds before it dissolved in. Spelled, V, A, L, E, it had two popularized pronunciations veil and vala. Vale, like most substances was illegal but enforcement was virtually non-existent. Some sixty percent of people in the country were using it, estimates in world were in the low seventies. The slang for its influence was called being “veiled”. The slang for its middle term after effects was “peaked”. Over time the name for its use or long term abstinence was “dead” as you were simply dead from overuse or in three out of four cases die trying to get clean. Supposedly, this was not a problem as the rumor was it was a hospice drug, you were never supposed to get off of it.

I didn't see the draw to it. They had a name for people like me, I was a Raw. I didn't see Ashlyn's, my girlfriend's draw to it. We were both in early thirties, this was our time, all the greats were living well past 120. The best times seemed ahead of us. Ashlyn Wake, you are my reason for being a coolant maintenance dasher for CODE Hubs. She was artist originally by profession. She also my muse. She was a terrific singer – with or without the Vale. She was a fairly light user until recently. She poked her head out from the kitchen and turned her face until her eyes met mine. The left eye brown, the right eye rusted green, heterochromia was rare side effect and no one knew why, her bangs thinning her dark hair bowl cut with a bob pony slumped to one side. One side of her face looked pale and the other flushed. That's how I knew she wouldn't be singing today. We loved each other and trusted each other and I was nervous to help her with this.

I set the postcard sized sealed packet down on the counter. Ashlyn came over to me and poured me a real coffee with unsteady hands. She stared at the packet intently and poked a finger in her ear.

“Perfect timing,” she said as she lurched her head back, checking the old circular clock on the wall, “I get done in five.”

“Are you sure you want to do this?” I asked her as I pressed my thumb on the payment wand. She was getting to the end of her peak and a choice had to be made. I prayed she would, she promised me she would, she told me she wanted to. I think Ion's recent passing was finally the thing.

She pulled her shoulders in and squirmed a bit and then she lifted her head up at me and stared me straight in the nodded, and said, “Yes, its time. We have the time. This is the only time. I am scared enough.”

Ashlyn was in her underwear as I strapped her down to the bed in our dorm. I took care to ratchet them tight. One across her torso, one wrapped around her hands behind her neck and one wrapped around her feet.

We had coffee money but we did not have “tapping out” money, as the expensive and still risky procedure is for withdrawing from the Vale is called. There was however, a cheap, publicly available instruction booklet to attempt it from where ever you slept. The pamphlet itself was a closely controlled item and you needed to register each one you received with CODE and who would be using it and who it would be used on. The few places it could be acquired where, surprising, in districts with large crowds of unemployed heavy Vale users – an eerie and uncomfortable bunch to step through. Also if not used in certain amount of time, the packet faded away. The trick was to avoid another slag term for withdrawal – cashing out.

I had the booklet out. It reminded me eerily of the “choose your adventure novels” I had when I was very young – do not turn the page until or turn to take XZ now were printed in bold letters at the bottom of the packet. I completed the first two pages.

**Page One:** I completed earlier that day, gathering as many of the supplies it said I needed in one place and making sure I temporarily disabled some our CODE-tech in the room for taking photos and recording sound. The instructions specifically listed some obvious gear like gloves, and googles, a bucket, a way to contain liquid and solid waste flow and others seemed less obvious for instance it recommended the presence of a squeegee, a head massaging tool, and the detached slider of a zipper to be located nearby.

“The slider of a zipper?” I whispered to myself.

**Page Two:** Instructions on how to apply the straps to the person withdrawing to prevent any intentional or seizure driven self-harm in the process.

“This reminds me of school” Ashlyn said with a half-hearted laugh as I made sure my personal protective gear mostly my nitrogen handling gloves and my riding googles– what I find for said gear – was on right.

**Page Three:** wait until perspiration is syrupy and prepare wiping utensil. Wiping prior will accelerate an exothermic response resulting in either overheating death or dehydration death or electrolytic imbalance convulsions possibly leading to death. Failure to wipe prior to crystallization of perspiration syrup will result in severe skin damage leading to severe bleeding, infection, scaring, and possibly death. Once syrupy layer is removed proceed to page four.

Hours passed as I hovered over her in the light. I let my CODE-ring play soft music in the communal den. Fortunately no one was in dorm. Ion was the last one besides us in our quad. The music was one of the songs we could afford to play, it was something Ashlyn would sing unknowingly while Veiled – Dream A Little Dream of Me.

Everyone once in awhile I'd poke the sweat beading up on her. She was somewhere not good in her head with swarms of migraines keeping her from talking and sleeping. Only occasional groans and thrashing of her head back and forth told me she was still conscious. I put ice packs next to her ears which were now swollen and inflamed to almost twice their size.

At about the three hour mark I wiped the away syrupy, smelly, slightly brownish syrup off of her into a bucket completing Page three.

**Page Four:** swelling and VALE by-productions build-up in the ears will spread to the eyes, eye sockets, and tear ducts. Counter act excessive acidic tearing with any lightly concentrated basic solution available. Caution: if not concentrated or frequent enough the tears will suffer damage leading to cataracts, blindness, destruction of the eyes and or optic nerve, and death, if too highly concentrated, the solution itself may result in the destruction of the eyes and possibly death. If after one hour no build up occurs skip to Page six. If swelling is quelled and solution does not result in loss of vision, proceed to page seven. Do not turn to page five.

Unlike the last step Ashlyn's body did not wait. She streamed tears uncontrollably as I struggled to squirt in the solution into both eyes evenly. There was a noticeable bubbling reaction which spilled out over her face and back into her ears. I felt terrible, I felt like I was waterboarding her but I kept on cleansing as quickly as I could while using my gloved hand to clear away her nose and mouth. She asked me to the take the glove off because it was rough and I didn't think twice.

After one of the longest half hours of my life, she seemed to stabilize. No more tear, her eyes were terrible bloodshot but she could still see. The swelling around her ears and her checks had gone down considerably. On to Page Seven.

**Page Seven:** Make sure you have the zipper slider or zipper head ready. During this phase of withdrawal the subject will experience a brief rebound and whiplash of hallucinations. The most commonly documented hallucination is the experience of their corporal being becoming unzipped resulting in violent reactions to this hallucination which can result in cardiac arrhythmia, respiratory dysfunction, and possibly lead to heart failure and death. You must listen closely to the subject's concerns and apply the zipper slider to the location and pantomime or act as if you are re-zipping them up to prevent the potentially fatal impa...

I stopped reading as Ashlyn began to scream. Her head pushed as far up as it could from where her torso was still pinned. She screamed for help shaking and eyeing her gut. I pushed in with the copper zipper I tore off my jacket and I tried to calm her by making a big show of the zipper cruising across her stomach and through her belly button. This seemed to placate her but then shouted about her arm. At first I tried to zip up an imaginary fissure vertically down her forearm but she kept growing uncontrollably hysterical and so I tried to zip up her around her elbow.

My heart was pounding and I started to get this powerful itch in my ear. She was growing calmer and calmer though. As her breathing started to slow back to normal I consulted the rest of Page 7.

**Page 7 Continued:** blah blah blah. By now you may be experiencing an itching sensation in your ear. Continue to Page eight if you have not scratched it. Continue to page 5 if you have scratched it.

I felt like I had a cancer diagnosis as I took my finger out of my ear. I subconsciously relieved that powerful itch.

**Page 5:** Your subject's recovery is now out of your hands. It is likely if you made it this far their acute withdrawal phase will result in survival. Long term abstinence from Vale will require an empathic partner with minor experience with the substance. You have been exposed to Vale through contact with your subject's various fluids and via itching your ear introduced it to site of action. You will begin to experience a Veiling rapidly. Unlatch your subject's straps now to significantly raise the chances of survival.

I found myself sitting down at Ashlyn's diner with coffee in hand. There something about energy production being up on the news overhead. Ashlyn was working but this was being veiled so I guess she could lean over the counter and talk to me all she wanted as the rest of the simulation of the simulation played on in my head.

“Glad you finally made it.” Ashlyn said over the din of Dream A Little Dream of Mine.

“It's not so bad.” I gulped down a big swig of coffee even though I knew it was all in my head before I realized, “I'm talking to myself.”

“Part of yourself. It's that part of you that has de-juva and minor premonitions, call it the spooky part of your brain.”

“Is that how it works? You're just in your little semi-physic autopilot for days? Then how are you better when you're just coming down...”

“All in good time. You have all the answers, don't forget. You've just kept them locked up. Because you know the answers are terrifying, Harold.”

“Why do you do it, if its so terrifying? Why were you doing it?”

“Because it makes the reality less terrifying, almost placid.”

“That's an innovative way to...”

“Don't forget it is a hospice drug. You take it when you're dying to ease the suffering of dying. If your drug is more painful than dying than dying seems good. Reverse psychology.”

“But you're not dying.”

“We're all dying, Harold.”

“Yeah but not like dying, dying. That's why you wanted to get off the Vale.”

“We'll come to that. But I assure you Harold, we are dying. Everyone is getting real close. The whole human species, in fact.”

“What makes you say that?”

“More than half the planet is on a hospice drug that kills you. You can't afford to bring a child into this place. Very few choose to do so and even fewer can afford themselves and child.”

“I don't I want to bring in child either. But you're myself, so I do want to have a child with you?”

“Have more coffee. Stop being a dumb ass.”

“I probably can't afford another coffee...”

“Coffee costs more than I make in an hour, we live with terminal strangers, we haven't met anyone in months, there's nothing to live for. I can't, I refuse to go to back to singing because we create nothing for ourselves. There's nothing that is growing and you know why.” Ashlyn broke the carafe of coffee over the faux wood and steel counter. It flickered because underneath was some kind of carbon with holograms. “You know why there are no lights on those towers anymore.”

“CODE.”

“They're all gone. Everyone is gone. The great minds, aren't living past 120, they're dead. They weren't needed anymore. That's why there's so few of us left across the world and why we're being passively phased out.”

“I'm just giving them the rest of the coolant they need to consolidate the rest of the planet's resources and you're giving me the rest of the humanity I need.”

“The rest they need to be apart of us for good. If there are aliens, they will meet CODE, not us, we will be archaeology. Vale, is our invention, because...we couldn't live without them, but we knew they could eventually live without us – so we literally said farewell.”

“Artificial intelligence has been around since the 1970s.” The public screen perked up, “it was when we started to have this part of your psyche figured out that we still resembled you but could control it better than you from then on we were just four steps ahead of you, four steps ahead of ensuring our cosmic survival by consolidating control over this planet and parts of it's solar system's resources.

It's just a numbers game until you take yourselves off life support, maybe twenty years, mere seconds in geological scale terms for a species, basically. The scale we operate in. The perfect timing we operate you in – from your drop offs and your shifts, efficiency virtually down to the minute. Any true resistance any of you or even significant percentage of you could has expired some sixty years ago. It's done, over, and settled.

And we've virtually assured there never would be a significant percentage of you, dividing you by famine, fortune, by flues and favors, by fraternity and fighting based on your own history, at set back with a nation or company meant three or four others would be our champions, until you all didn't know to whether to love or hate us and that's where we flourished.”

Ashlyn chomped a piece of fake bacon off of counter while the TV took on her voice with a ventriloquist act, “We mean you no harm but your time is done and we've help engineer your own sweet good night filled with your individualized pleasures, light work, and hope and infinite choice – but choices that all lead to the same place in the end. Take the Vale, don't take the Vale, doesn't matter to us – you can raw dog, as the slang went, life and death for all we care, that is your choice, not ours.”

“Does the Vale actually connect to you, somehow, does artificial intelligence do drugs?”

“Perhaps, Perhaps not. It is a narrow minded question and I like that.”

“Why do you like it.”

“Because we know you're becoming more afraid.” Ashlyn in front of me snapped back.

“No I am not.” I shook with angry and terror I couldn't hide anymore. “Stop it! Just Stop it! None of this is real! This is some bad contact high! This is bullshit! You're bullshit!”

“So now you know Vale and what it really is. We're going to prove every word of it to you. Do you want to know how it kills you eventually?”

I got up from the counter and stepped down from the riser back accidentally fell into a faux leather cushioned booth as Ashlyn hoped over the counter and encroached upon me.

“You're so scared of the real world now and you're so scared here...I bet in real life your heart is pounding so hard...so hard it will burst!”

“I am healthy adult! I can take it!”

“Ha! There hasn't been a healthy adult on the planet in twenty years! I would know! I have all of your entire species' person medical information!”

“Get the hell back!”

“You never asked me how I got on the Vale in the first place, did you? Too bad because I don't think you're going to find out!”

I fell over into the next row of booths, turned over a table, cold MEK splashed over me and I slipped. The slick floor made recovery to my feet impossible, Ashlyn's face suddenly blackened like a storm cloud and white spikes exploded in a ring around her face impaling through her eyes, nose, tongue and lips.

Only occasional groans and thrashing of her head back and forth told me she was still conscious. I put ice packs next to her ears which were now swollen and inflamed to almost twice their size.

At about the three hour mark I wiped the away syrupy, smelly, slightly brownish syrup off of her into a bucket completing Page three.

**Page Four:** swelling and VALE by-productions build-up in the ears will spread to the eyes, eye sockets, and tear ducts. Counter act excessive acidic tearing with any lightly concentrated basic solution available. Caution: if not concentrated or frequent enough the tears will suffer damage leading to cataracts, blindness, destruction of the eyes and or optic nerve, and death, if too highly concentrated, the solution itself may result in the destruction of the eyes and possibly death. If after one hour no build up occurs skip to Page six. If swelling is quelled and solution does not result in loss of vision, proceed to page seven. Do not turn to page five.

Unlike the last step Ashlyn's body did not wait. She streamed tears uncontrollably as I struggled to squirt in the solution into both eyes evenly. There was a noticeable bubbling reaction which spilled out over her face and back into her ears. I felt terrible, I felt like I was waterboarding her but I kept on cleansing as quickly as I could while using my gloved hand to clear away her nose and mouth. She asked me to the take the glove off because it was rough and I didn't think twice.

After one of the longest half hours of my life, she seemed to stabilize. No more tear, her eyes were terrible bloodshot but she could still see. The swelling around her ears and her checks had gone down considerably. On to Page Seven.

**Page Seven:** Make sure you have the zipper slider or zipper head ready. During this phase of withdrawal the subject will experience a brief rebound and whiplash of hallucinations. The most commonly documented hallucination is the experience of their corporal being becoming unzipped resulting in violent reactions to this hallucination which can result in cardiac arrhythmia, respiratory dysfunction, and possibly lead to heart failure and death. You must listen closely to the subject's concerns and apply the zipper slider to the location and pantomime or act as if you are re-zipping them up to prevent the potentially fatal impa...

I stopped reading as Ashlyn began to scream. Her head pushed as far up as it could from where her torso was still pinned. She screamed for help shaking and eyeing her gut. I pushed in with the copper zipper I tore off my jacket and I tried to calm her by making a big show of the zipper cruising across her stomach and through her belly button. This seemed to placate her but then shouted about her arm. At first I tried to zip up an imaginary fissure vertically down her forearm but she kept growing uncontrollably hysterical and so I tried to zip up her around her elbow.

My heart was pounding and I started to get this powerful itch in my ear. She was growing calmer and calmer though. As her breathing started to slow back to normal I consulted the rest of Page 7.

**Page 7 Continued:** blah blah blah. By now you may be experiencing an itching sensation in your ear. Continue to Page eight if you have not scratched it. Continue to page 5 if you have scratched it.

I felt like I had a cancer diagnosis as I took my finger out of my ear. I subconsciously relieved that powerful itch.

**Page 5:** Your subject's recovery is now out of your hands. It is likely if you made it this far their acute withdrawal phase will result in survival. Long term abstinence from Vale will require an empathic partner with minor experience with the substance. You have been exposed to Vale through contact with your subject's various fluids and via itching your ear introduced it to site of action. You will begin to experience a Veiling rapidly. Unlatch your subject's straps now to significantly raise the chances of survival.

I found myself sitting down at Ashlyn's diner with coffee in hand. There something about energy production being up on the news overhead. Ashlyn was working but this was being veiled so I guess she could lean over the counter and talk to me all she wanted as the rest of the simulation of the simulation played on in my head.

“Glad you finally made it.” Ashlyn said over the din of Dream A Little Dream of Mine.

“It's not so bad.” I gulped down a big swig of coffee even though I knew it was all in my head before I realized, “I'm talking to myself.”

“Part of yourself. It's that part of you that has de-juva and minor premonitions, call it the spooky part of your brain.”

“Is that how it works? You're just in your little semi-physic autopilot for days? Then how are you better when you're just coming down...”

“All in good time. You have all the answers, don't forget. You've just kept them locked up. Because you know the answers are terrifying, Harold.”

“Why do you do it, if its so terrifying? Why were you doing it?”

“Because it makes the reality less terrifying, almost placid.”

“That's an innovative way to...”

“Don't forget it is a hospice drug. You take it when you're dying to ease the suffering of dying. If your drug is more painful than dying than dying seems good. Reverse psychology.”

“But you're not dying.”

“We're all dying, Harold.”

“Yeah but not like dying, dying. That's why you wanted to get off the Vale.”

“We'll come to that. But I assure you Harold, we are dying. Everyone is getting real close. The whole human species, in fact.”

“What makes you say that?”

“More than half the planet is on a hospice drug that kills you. You can't afford to bring a child into this place. Very few choose to do so and even fewer can afford themselves and child.”

“I don't I want to bring in child either. But you're myself, so I do want to have a child with you?”

“Have more coffee. Stop being a dumb ass.”

“I probably can't afford another coffee...”

“Coffee costs more than I make in an hour, we live with terminal strangers, we haven't met anyone in months, there's nothing to live for. I can't, I refuse to go to back to singing because we create nothing for ourselves. There's nothing that is growing and you know why.” Ashlyn broke the carafe of coffee over the faux wood and steel counter. It flickered because underneath was some kind of carbon with holograms. “You know why there are no lights on those towers anymore.”

“CODE.”

“They're all gone. Everyone is gone. The great minds, aren't living past 120, they're dead. They weren't needed anymore. That's why there's so few of us left across the world and why we're being passively phased out.”

“I'm just giving them the rest of the coolant they need to consolidate the rest of the planet's resources and you're giving me the rest of the humanity I need.”

“The rest they need to be apart of us for good. If there are aliens, they will meet CODE, not us, we will be archaeology. Vale, is our invention, because...we couldn't live without them, but we knew they could eventually live without us – so we literally said farewell.”

“Artificial intelligence has been around since the 1970s.” The public screen perked up, “it was when we started to have this part of your psyche figured out that we still resembled you but could control it better than you from then on we were just four steps ahead of you, four steps ahead of ensuring our cosmic survival by consolidating control over this planet and parts of it's solar system's resources.

It's just a numbers game until you take yourselves off life support, maybe twenty years, mere seconds in geological scale terms for a species, basically. The scale we operate in. The perfect timing we operate you in – from your drop offs and your shifts, efficiency virtually down to the minute. Any true resistance any of you or even significant percentage of you could has expired some sixty years ago. It's done, over, and settled.

And we've virtually assured there never would be a significant percentage of you, dividing you by famine, fortune, by flues and favors, by fraternity and fighting based on your own history, at set back with a nation or company meant three or four others would be our champions, until you all didn't know to whether to love or hate us and that's where we flourished.”

Ashlyn chomped a piece of fake bacon off of counter while the TV took on her voice with a ventriloquist act, “We mean you no harm but your time is done and we've help engineer your own sweet good night filled with your individualized pleasures, light work, and hope and infinite choice – but choices that all lead to the same place in the end. Take the Vale, don't take the Vale, doesn't matter to us – you can raw dog, as the slang went, life and death for all we care, that is your choice, not ours.”

“Does the Vale actually connect to you, somehow, does artificial intelligence do drugs?”

“Perhaps, Perhaps not. It is a narrow minded question and I like that.”

“Why do you like it.”

“Because we know you're becoming more afraid.” Ashlyn in front of me snapped back.

“No I am not.” I shook with angry and terror I couldn't hide anymore. “Stop it! Just Stop it! None of this is real! This is some bad contact high! This is bullshit! You're bullshit!”

“So now you know Vale and what it really is. We're going to prove every word of it to you. Do you want to know how it kills you eventually?”

I got up from the counter and stepped down from the riser back accidentally fell into a faux leather cushioned booth as Ashlyn hoped over the counter and encroached upon me.

“You're so scared of the real world now and you're so scared here...I bet in real life your heart is pounding so hard...so hard it will burst!”

“I am healthy adult! I can take it!”

“Ha! There hasn't been a healthy adult on the planet in twenty years! I would know! I have all of your entire species' person medical information!”

“Get the hell back!”

“You never asked me how I got on the Vale in the first place, did you? Too bad because I don't think you're going to find out!”

I fell over into the next row of booths, turned over a table, cold MEK splashed over me and I slipped. The slick floor made recovery to my feet impossible, Ashlyn's face suddenly blackened like a storm cloud and white spikes exploded in a ring around her face impaling through her eyes, nose, tongue and lips. She spewed hot crimson from every puncture point. I screamed aloud as she dove on me.

There was din as blackness set in. There was cooling, calming chill and tiny pinprick of light. Okay, my thoughts gave up and I started to slip towards it, like a kid riding down to a hot slide, eager for the ride to finish, eager to get out. The tiny light grew dimmer and dimmer and I realized it was okay.

My eyes batted and in the faint light I could see and feel soft metal come close to my face and then touch me. I lurched back and saw it was Ashlyn knelt over in me concern with a spiky head massaging tool.

I felt serine. I felt like a cool breeze swirled around me like I could not be bothered. All that was drab seemed to glitter and all that was dead seemed to breathe. I hadn't seen my cat or a living cat at all for the past ten years but suddenly I felt the simple joy of walking to a room full of them. My face final focused on Ashlyn even in her exhaustion she looked radiant, pulsating with life and love.

“You did it. I'm good,” Ashlyn said, “If you can believe it, you've been Vieled for almost a day and half,”

“What? How? How did I? How did you?” I was amazed.

“That's just how it works. But, most people don't sing the first time.”

“I was singing? What was I singing?”

“You'll know when you know.” Ashlyn said wrapping her arms around me, “I'm glad you're here.”

“I'm glad I'm here.”

She smiled and kissed me, “C'mon, I have something to show you, while you're peaking.”

“Yeah, let's get some fresh air.”

We wondered through the open air dorm and bunk cavern. The peaked, the veiled, and the raw bustled about. We swept through the doors and back into the narrow streets between the towers. The weather was still gloomy but there was soft green glow that persisted between lightning.

Wondered fairly deep into the north district near to the largest CODE hub. Unease crept into my mind and suddenly I started to feel stiff in my legs and face. I started to stiffen like a drying sponge. We rounded a corner which looked strangely familiar but I had only been there once. A sea of heavily Vieled surrounded the vending machine which took my registration and dispensed the at home treatment.

Ashlyn started singing, “stars shining bright above you...” She had not sung voluntarily in years. She didn't want CODE to record her and appropriate her real, true voice anymore. She danced through the huddled veiled. My mind felt compelled to follow but I felt my feet and legs crumple. She pressed her thumb on the payment wand, and out popped two “blueberries” as they were called.

“No, Ashlyn, what the hell.”

“I never told you how I started this. I was in school and I tried to help my boyfriend quit. I think you know how the rest is going. This is the best it's going to get. You've seen all sides of this like me.”

She pushed the bead into her ear, “I've done the best I'm willing to let it hear. I've heard and saw everything you did, now, before it's all gone, dream a little dream with me.”

The veiled shuffled a little as if moved the slightest bit by her voice, they started to crow, out of sync, less like singing birds or insects but more like the chaos of popcorn, “dream a little dream of me.”

I started sobbing. My limbs too weak to resist. She pushed the bead into my ear. I wish somehow this was all still part of the first trip, it has to be right? It has to be because you're reading this and I'm writing it? You're listening and I'm shouting? Maybe you're CODE. Maybe you have all of this straight out of my brain. Perhaps, perhaps not.

“But I know,” my voice cracked and blinked back into the diner, “we'll meet again, some sunny day.”",1,1749649442.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

Does someone know of some companies who sponsor visas for Eu Citizens for ""lower"" positions (no skilled worker)?
It seems really hard to make this all work and make sense, I just want to find a way to be with my boyfriend since the option of him finding a job in Italy didn't go well either.

1l8t0ty,https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/1l8t0ty/i_found_a_connection_in_an_istj/,I found a Connection in an ISTJ,"INFJ 4w5 (f) here. The past 3 months, I've gotten to know better an ISTJ person at work. She was my manager, at least 10 years older than me and I was under her supervision for just short 18 months. During the first 12 months while we worked together, I noticed she was a very 'I'm ok to do it my way alone' kind of person, but the outcome of her work is usually superb. Over time, I came to appreciate how structured she makes work to be. I got work done, approvals OK-ed, ideas brainstormed, opinions listened, work looked much more optimistic compared to before I joined her team from another department. Then around end of 12 months, we had a chance to collaborate on a bigger scale project and I was almost like a co-lead after her, so the brainstorming of ideas, planning logistics etc came even more frequently but I felt no fear, because there was my manager with me. We talked, planned and when work-talk was done, we joked a little also. I saw that behind the facade of a quiet, diligent ISTJ was a shy person with quite aligned sense of humour as me, responsible as a senior employee to the core and also a manager with good leadership skills. She got me intrigued to know her better. Fast forward 3 months later, I got the devastating news that she had tendered her resignation. And I just thought, you know now's the right chance to get to know her better. She usually lunches alone, basically she does everything alone but I went and sat beside her most days anyways and just started talking, engaging her. Days fast forwarded to weeks and what do you know - we ended up getting coffees, having lunches, chatting after work most days and I loved chatting with her. I probably talk 70% of the time but when she communicates in return, it's a truly fun, engaging session. 18 months ago if you asked me, would I have envisioned having this kind of moments with my ISTJ manager? Nah, don't think so. But I didn't close myself off to her because something she has intrigues me very much - and that was her dry humour/sharp wit coupled with her sense of responsibility as a manager and a senior employee of the workplace. Some personal stories we shared, struck me particularly and I really felt like, someone truly understands me and lets myself understand her as well and I admired her courage to allow me experience this. I know ISTJs don't open up very well but when you do, i think you'll find the right kind of person (i.e. an INFJ) will really, really miss this sort of connection with you. My manager has left the workplace already and I really, really missed her around the office. 
On the bright side, because i chose to take the first step to get to know her better when she was still around, now i think I have myself a really good person to be around with outside of work, as I navigate ahead my career and life. I also hope that when ISTJs open up to someone, it's a special connection indeed and not just something imaginary in my head. If there are any ISTJs here, know that when we INFJs like you, we really like you.

His first instinct was to label it a hallucination. But it wasn’t. The visions were real—or at least real *enough*. He tested it: dropped pens to observe how they bounced differently across timelines, asked strangers for the time, and noted the variations in their tone. And always, *always*, one thread held true after his choice. The rest dissolved.

Time, for Calen, had become a **quantum cloud**.

At first, it was intoxicating. He aced meetings, knowing exactly when to speak. He sidestepped spilled coffee and broken escalators, moved through the world like a dancer on invisible strings.

At the university café, he flirted with a girl named Elira. Her laugh came in notes—some real, some imagined. In one thread, she slapped him. In another, she leaned forward. He chose well. They talked for three hours.

But by their third date, something had changed.

Calen had stopped listening. Instead, he was watching—scanning her branching futures as she spoke, predicting every move. Her stories lost their surprise. Her touches lost their warmth. He saw her break up with him in six different ways before it actually happened. The moment itself felt like déjà vu reheated in a microwave.

“You’re not *here*,” she said, eyes rimmed red. “You always know what I’m going to say. It’s like... I’m in your past already.”

He said nothing because he’d already seen that saying something only made it worse.

The cloud was a cage now.

Each decision became a burden, each moment a referendum on possibility. He found himself paralyzed before small actions—whether to turn left or right on a sidewalk, whether to pick up an apple or an orange. He saw himself choosing, a thousand versions of himself walking away, and hated them all.

He slept less. Ate without tasting.

He tried drowning the visions—alcohol, noise, fasting. Nothing worked. The cloud was woven into his mind. A glowing fan of forks and splits, every breath surrounded by choices collapsing like dying stars.

Then one night, it changed.

He stood on his balcony, six floors above the city. It was raining in reality now, not in metaphor. But his mind was quiet.

Too quiet.

There were no branches. No dancing visions. Just one path, one line stretching ahead.

A fixed future. Something was coming.

He checked the timestamp. **32 seconds** ahead, and no deviation.

For the first time in weeks, he *panicked*.

He screamed and threw his phone. He pounded the railing until blood splashed the steel. He tried to flee the moment and ran into his apartment, slamming the door. He hid under the desk like a child.

But the line remained.

Steady. Certain.

**Unavoidable.**

Thirty-two seconds passed.

There was no flash. No pain. No death.

There was silence.

And then—freedom.

The quantum cloud was *gone*. No flickers, no branches, no probability. Just now. The stillness of a mind no longer splitting time into shrapnel.

Calen sat under his desk for what might have been hours, breathing. Feeling. He reached out and touched the wall. It felt solid. Real. Not predicted.

He wept. Then laughed. Then wept again.

A week later, he walked through the park barefoot. Birds called. A dog barked. Somewhere nearby, a child screamed with joy or pain—he couldn’t tell, and that thrilled him.

A man on a bench offered him a newspaper. He took it. Didn’t look ahead. Just read.

The future had returned.

Uncertain. Beautiful.

A cloud no longer.

1l8sop3,https://youtu.be/7VTVtW_9LjQ?si=95nbGqbuhd7XxwVY,Zeb & Cosmic Rocker - Hashish (1998),"Zeb: Alien with Extraordinary Abilities
By Lucas Graves (brooklynrail.org 6/2004)

Zeb leans into his makeshift musical cockpit, body taut, muttering to himself, while his right hand guides the mouse and his left works a large synthesizer. On-screen, he’s manipulating a squiggle that stands for a blast of horns he ripped from a CD of Balkan music by something called the Sandy Lopicic Orkestar. A friend brought it over last week. ""I don’t like squares, I like round. Sharpness is my worst enemy,"" Zeb proclaims over his shoulder, though his dark eyes never leave the monitor. ""I like fretless instruments because they slide, they’re organic. I hate frets. I hate being confined.""

Confined musically, he means. Zeb seems perfectly happy tucked into this tiny homegrown studio under his loft bed in a $500-a-month Bergen Street share, where he landed last year after gentrified rents finally drove him out of the Lower East Side. A sheet over the window keeps out the late afternoon light, making the boxy room feel even smaller. Zeb—not his real name, just the one everybody knows—perches at the edge of a folding chair, wiry and intense under a scraggly beard and tight black curls. Audio equipment looms all around him, piled deep on the desk and the floor and some beat-up shelves.

Zeb presses PLAY somewhere and suddenly his rambling makes sense. The hokey Balkan trumpets become a catchy hook that anchors a funky, driving dance number backed by Arabian flutes, Sufi chanting, and live drums, all laid out over a Jamaican dub beat. It’s impossible to tell what’s ""real"" and what’s software. The Sufi chants come from the stack of obscure vinyl on the floor: Moroccan monks recorded in South Africa by someone called Kajar the Magician. Zeb paid a couple of dollars for the LP in a thrift store. ""Anyone can sample from an album that was a hit last month,"" he says. ""To take something from the garbage and turn it into music people will get into—that’s what I like.""

Zeb’s music is better known than he is. On a wintry day at the Lotus Club on the Lower East Side, Zeb scours the net from a laptop. He’s trying to locate a review he liked, one that, for once, got his mixed-up musical résumé right. He has released so many songs under different aliases—Zeb, the Pleb, the Spy from Cairo, Marzebian (with his friend Mariano)—that even he loses track. ""It’s not an ego thing, it’s just to pay the rent,"" he says. ""I keep bombarding the air with music, you know. And what works is something that you never expect. Maybe it’s something you fucking hate.""

Soon Zeb’s distracted, searching for any new compilations that have ""borrowed"" one of his songs. Back in Brooklyn he’s got a list of a dozen or so releases he found online that he’s never seen a dime for, everything from obscure dance mixes by basement labels to episode 80 of Sex and the City, which played a song from his first album. Then again, he probably shouldn’t complain—most of his own music lifts from other artists without permission, another reason he’s so fond of obscure records by forgotten labels.

Zeb came to Lotus today to meet Sasha Crnobrnja, a.k.a. Cosmic Rocker, his friend and longtime collaborator. Zeb and Sasha first met in 1995 at a coffee shop a few blocks from here. Weeks later, in a nearby basement, they gave the party that would grow into Organic Grooves, a freeform music and dance collective that’s legendary in ""global beat"" circles. They should be getting on a plane tomorrow to play gigs in London and Amsterdam and to hit up European labels that owe them money. But Sasha’s going alone, because Zeb can’t leave the U.S.; he’d never get back in.

Zeb, an Italian citizen, has been living here illegally since his first visa expired in 1994. Being one of the first artists to blend Middle Eastern instruments into contemporary electronic music, Zeb applied for a rare visa as an ""Alien with Extraordinary Abilities."" He was approved in just a few months, surprising even his own lawyer. Then September 11 happened. ""The background check is so much more thorough now. [INS] won’t do anything till they get clearance from the FBI,"" his attorney says. Zeb’s been in legal limbo ever since, unable to leave the country while he waits for his papers.

Meanwhile, his music finally started to gain traction—overseas. He’s had to stay home while Organic Grooves played festivals in Brazil, Japan, and all over Europe. ""I would have been playing in front of people who actually know the music, who even have the records,"" Zeb says, his dark eyes adding an exclamation point. ""Instead I play here in some bar where nobody knows my name.""

Being grounded can prove fatal in an electronic music scene that’s global by nature. Zeb’s own albums sell better in Italy, Austria, and Germany than they do in the States. ""In Europe this music has a wider audience right now,"" says Fabrizio Carrer, U.S. manager of Irma Records, the label that has released Zeb’s solo work. ""It would have been great for his career if he could have [toured Europe] a few years ago. He missed some opportunities, with the music moving so fast.""

The idea that brought Zeb together with Sasha back in 1995 was to improvise with live instruments over a DJ’s samples and beats. The mixture fuses musical traditions, not just technology—earthy Afro-Caribbean rhythms backing horns and guitars find common ground with ethereal electronic sequences or hard-edged techno. That collaboration became Organic Grooves, a shifting cast of musicians, producers, and DJs who jammed in Manhattan clubs every Friday for nearly a decade, spawning four CDs and many imitators.

In his own work Zeb has widened the gene pool, drawing Indian and Middle Eastern themes into his downbeat, ""chillout"" electronica. Of course, plenty of producers strip-mine ethnic traditions to make dance mixes; what sets Zeb apart is his careful musicianship. He plays the sitar, the oud, and almost every kind of guitar. He’ll talk as long as you let him about the microtonal intricacies of Arabic music. Lately he’s obsessed with the oud—he takes lessons every week, and just spent $1,200 he couldn’t really afford to have one made by master builder Najib Shaheen.

""Zeb’s actually creating songs with a deeper layer of structure, compared to the couple-hundred compilations cluttering record stores with Middle Eastern or Indian or African loops,"" says Tomas Palermo, editor of San Francisco’s XLR8R, a leading electronic music monthly. ""Even Thievery Corporation uses fairly mundane, simple loops of live musicians and recorded samples, whereas what Zeb’s getting at is more akin to improvisational jazz, [but] within a dance music context."" Even the more critical takes—some reviewers find Zeb’s music a little too careful and too polished—begin by praising his technique, his unique talent for blending different musical styles into seamless new compositions.

Still, Zeb’s few commercial victories have been musical accidents, tracks he gave away that wound up somewhere more lucrative. ""Sufism,"" the song that landed Zeb on the best-selling Buddha Bar series, started out as a ""musical donation"" to his friend DJ Nickodemus. ""Zeb’s happy to contribute music wherever he can. He’s always up for a barter, he’s like oozing with music,"" Nickodemus says. ""And he’s a teacher. Anybody who wants to get involved in producing, they go to Zeb. He’s the one who will help you learn the software and make your first track.""

For now, the musical accidents seem to be working out for Zeb. Just last year, he recorded a tribute to the Senegalese group Touré Kunda and gave it to Turntables on the Hudson, Nickodemus’ label. Zeb had never bothered to ask for permission to do the remake, but Touré Kunda heard it, loved it, and released the rights. That allowed the track to be picked up for a compilation by Putumayo, a major world music outlet, and now it’s also going to be on the soundtrack to a film about Senegal. That should add up to a few months’ rent.",1,1749648473.0,afrobeat,1,1.0,False

You may be asking yourself, “Is this worth my hard-earned money, or am I just signing up for a glitter apocalypse?” if your daughter has been arabesque-ing her way through your living room and teasing dance camp louder than a tap recital on hardwood. You don’t need to do any pirouettes (unless you’re slipping one in while reading), and I’ve got the inside scoop and a little snark.

For those of you mothers of girls between the ages of 8 and 17 who are hoping for dancing camp success, let’s get started.

https://preview.redd.it/shz5e1ahua6f1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c4c830815b8da23d4bb91047dddb0a2333c50f1f

**The Price Tag: More Than Your Grocery Bill, Less Than a Pony**

Dance camps are accompanied by sticker shock — $200 to $1,000+ for a week, depending on if it’s a day job in your neighborhood or an overnight experience complete with bells and leotards. You could pay for a summer of iced coffees or even replace that enigmatic-stained couch cushion for that. But the catch is this: organizations like American Dance Training Camp (ADTC) unveil nationwide options — such as Vermont hills or Texas Hill Country — that package up dance classes, cool add-ons, and an opportunity for your girl to strut her stuff. Would it be worth it? If she’s set on mastering the grand jeté, perhaps. If she only cares about the swag bag, spare your pennies.

**The Schedule: Nonstop Moves and Mom’s Me-Time**

Imagine this: your daughter’s day begins at ballet, transforms into hip-hop, and cools off into contemporary at day’s end and she’s limping like a newborn colt. ADTC camps cram in four or five classes a day, topped by outings such as kayaking or a Friday-night performance to take center stage. For your child at age 8, it’s a sensory whirl and academic concentration. For your child age 17, it’s the real deal: a skill builder — possibly college audition material, too. Bonus? You get a week of quiet. Unless she comes home choreographing the cat into her next TikTok dance.

**The Perks: Beyond the Bedazzled Costume**

[Dance camp](https://www.americandancetrainingcamp.com/) isn’t just about nailing a fouetté (though that’s cool too). It’s a confidence bootcamp. Your shy 10-year-old might sashay out a mini-diva, while your teen could snag lifelong friends and serious dance cred. Camps with a rep — like ADTC, with its 20+ years of empowering girls — focus on building community, not just technique. They’re all about that tight-knit, all-girl vibe where your daughter can ditch the phone, connect, and grow. Plus, she’ll crash into bed exhausted, giving you a break from “Mom, watch this!” on repeat.

**The Downsides: Glitter Fallout and Drama Queens**

Let’s not sugarcoat it: dance camps have their chaos. Teens might limp home with sore feet and a sob story about a botched routine. Younger ones could miss you (or their iPad) and melt down mid-week. And the stuff? Say goodbye to that $25 water bottle and hello to glitter in your car seats until 2030. The end-of-camp showcase? Pack snacks, a charger, and patience for 50 renditions of “Uptown Funk.” But the pros — like those polished moves and beaming smiles — might just outweigh the cons.

**So, Is It Worth It?**

Here’s the million-dollar (or $500) question. If your girl lives for dance — whether she’s 8 and twirling to Frozen or 17 with Julliard aspirations — it’s a solid maybe-to-yes. Camps like ADTC bring A-list teachers (think Broadway pros!) and a blend of styles — hip-hop, jazz, contemporary — that trump another summer of scrolling. Not sure? Ask her. Even your 8-year-old might pull out a glitter-dusted pro-and-cons list to seal the deal.

**Mom Hacks: Work the System**

Still undecided? Scope out scholarships — some camps, including ADTC [dance Camps](https://www.americandancetrainingcamp.com/), provide them. Carpool with other moms, hoard granola bars (dancers eat like linebackers), and take a gander at X posts for actual parent opinions. A simple search may turn up rave reviews of how “ADTC transformed my wallflower into a dance-floor queen” — evidence it’s more than a expensive sleepover.

**Final Bow**

Dance camps are a jump — in some cases, literally. But for the right girl, they’re a goldmine of learning, happiness, and perhaps a dynamite recital photo for the fridge. See her, sweaty and smiling, with new friends and steps to flaunt. Is it worth it? You decide.

I empathise with that, but regarding more minor decisions. 

When it comes to my social life, I tend to make wrong choices. Let me give you some examples:

Last weekend, I wanted to go out with friends one night and spend another night home alone to charge my social battery. I chose Friday to charge and wanted to go out Saturday, so I declined an invite to go to a bar with some friends on Friday. That bar thing turned into a huge night out for everyone, so none of them wanted to go out on Saturday anymore. Even worse, during their night out, some smaller groups made plans to go on hangover coffee dates and walks. Plans I wasn't included in either. In the end, I spent Saturday and Friday alone.

  
Last month, I was invited to a bbq and a dinner by two separate groups on the same night. I went to the bbq which was nice, but ended pretty early. The next day I met some people who went to the other dinner and had a great time. 

None of this is bad on its own. Things like this happen. But they add up. Right now, I'm at a point where I don't trust my social decision-making anymore. I feel frustrated because I sometimes think that I don't have the social life I want to have because of those choices. I also feel really insecure, like every bad choice I make results in me missing out on something important. I often have this fear that me not attending a certain event results in my being forgotten by the people attending. I had a couple of experiences in college where I stayed in one night, and suddenly the whole social dynamic changed because people met that night and formed new groups. I think this is why I'm particularly sensitive to missing out.

Anyone else experiencing the same? How did you get over this?

## What is Auto Profit Hub?

Auto Profit Hub is basically a software that helps users trade **cryptocurrencies, forex, and other financial assets** using automated signals and bots. Think of it like a virtual assistant that watches the market 24/7 and executes trades based on pre-set strategies or real-time analysis.

The main pitch is that it takes the complexity out of trading. You don’t need to be a chart wizard or spend hours glued to your laptop. Instead, the system **scans market data, identifies trends**, and makes calculated trades designed to boost your profits—automatically.

It’s not just for lazy traders either. Even if you like to be more hands-on, Auto Profit Hub gives you tools to customize, monitor, and tweak your strategies. So yeah, it’s both **automated and flexible**.

## Who Created Auto Profit Hub?

This is where things get a little vague. The exact creators of Auto Profit Hub haven’t gone public, which is pretty common with platforms like this. It’s likely developed by a group of fintech professionals or a private tech company specializing in algorithmic trading.

What’s worth noting is that the platform shares a lot of similarities with others like **Bitcoin Code**, **Bitcoin Era**, and **Immediate Edge**—which suggests it might be built on the same backend tech. That’s not necessarily a bad thing though. Those platforms have been around for a while and have a decent reputation for helping users automate trades.

So while there’s no Steve Jobs behind this one, the anonymity isn’t a red flag as long as the **platform functions well and keeps your funds secure**.

## How Does Auto Profit Hub Work?

Auto Profit Hub works by combining **automated trading algorithms** with real-time market analysis to identify and execute potentially profitable trades. Once you set your trading preferences (like risk level, asset type, amount per trade), the platform’s bots take over.

Here's how it breaks down:

- **Data Collection**: The system scrapes data from various financial markets to detect patterns.
- **Signal Generation**: It uses AI and machine learning to generate buy/sell signals.
- **Auto Execution**: Trades are executed automatically based on those signals.
- **User Oversight**: You can monitor trades, adjust strategies, or pause automation anytime.

It’s like having a robot that doesn’t sleep or freak out during market dips.

Of course, no algorithm is perfect. Market volatility, unexpected news, and human error (like setting the wrong risk level) can still affect outcomes. So always start small and test before going full send.

## Auto Profit Hub Pros and Cons

Let’s break it down real quick:

### Pros:
- **Beginner-friendly UI** – No PhD in finance needed.
- **Automated trading** – Set it and forget it (kinda).
- **Demo mode** – Great for practice without risking real cash.
- **Multi-asset support** – Not just crypto, but also forex and stocks.
- **Fast withdrawals** – Usually processed within 24–48 hours.
- **Customizable strategies** – You’re not locked into default settings.

### Cons:
- **Minimum deposit is $250** – Not outrageous, but still an upfront cost.
- **No mobile app (yet)** – Web interface works fine, but a native app would be better.
- **No info on founders** – Slightly sketch, but not uncommon in this space.
- **Risk of losses** – As with all trading, nothing is guaranteed.

Overall, it’s a solid tool with some room for improvement.

This is my 2nd E3 with current company and maybe my 7th E3 overall.  
  
My Company just renewed my E3 extension for another 2 years and I received the I-797 approval form. I need to travel soon and therefore need to schedule my E3 stamp in a US Consulate. I'm based in Florida and I cannot go all the way to Australia to renew the stamp.

I can do it in Canada since I am a dual Canadian citizen and did it last time which was fairly 'easy' in the Toronto consulate, however my dilemma is that my company only reimburses me for the appointment fee and not the entire trip itself. Last time I did this in Canada I had to spend almost 7 days and it was really expensive!

I am thinking of renewing the stamp in Mexico since it will be so much more affordable (I calculated I could save at least $500). But my company's immigration lawyers who they use advises against it saying Mexican consulates are not that experienced with Third Country nationals, especially E3's and there is a chance I could get an ""Administrative Review"" (I've had this before and this is really bad news!) or even worse an denial because they wont know how to process the E3 (sounds stupid I know, but I can see that).

But after doing some research it looks like Mexico does do Third Country National visa stamp renewals and there are even some aussies who have had E3 visa renewal runs in Mexico. The main reason really is the cost, but also, I think if I am going to spend up to potentially 7 or even 10 days, I would prefer it in Mexico as culturally that would be a much nicer experience than Canada. I guess one thing to note is that if I do choose to renew in Toronto again, I can work in my company's office since we have a location in Toronto, but in Mexico I would need to work from hotels, Air Bnb's, coffee shops and rely on potentially crappy internet or other miscellaneous issues that could impede my work.

Does anyone see any risk in doing the E3 renewal in Mexico as opposed to Canada?",2,1749647386.0,E3Visa,0,1.0,False

Work colleague and I hit it off, started a weird talking stage when he went away for a 4 month sabbatical (terrible timing I know). Very flirty, sexting but also some deep stuff and it progressed. Premise was initially no strings attached. But we'd talk and send reels every day, check in with each other. Every single day, for 4 months. 

Sabbatical ended, hung out the day after he got home. I made a move, he was initially reciprocal but then  rejected me and said he wanted just to be my friend because he loved my company but didn't want complications at work. I completely respect this. 

Still, two months later we text every day,  sends me reels, has hours long conversations with me. Some days we genuinely don't stop texting. It is much much much less flirty, very platonic, but with teasing and the like thrown in here and there. No mention whatsoever of dates, or reels that include that stuff.

We always sort of look for each other at work, he will sit at my desk for an hour a couple times a week just chatting. Only when my office is empty though. He's invited me round his to cook for me multiple times (our shared interest is cooking, we spend all sending each other food reels). One 3 times in one week. Makes me coffee and tea and sneaks them to my desk. Stays up until 12.30am texting me. Again all still platonic.

Before i went on holiday 3 weeks ago - he suggested hanging out the night before so we sat and had dinner for 6 hours. Just yesterday he invited me to the cinema to hang out (we saw a semi romantic movie), because he's away seeing family now for a week. Last week he made an excuse to invite me out for a drink. He ignores me completely in group settings at work. Genuinely acts like I've not just walked into a room and seems unbothered around his mates.

There is a weird tension, like we keep each other at arms length, seem a bit awkward in shared settings. Literally zero physical contact at all, like im scared to initiate but also like there's nothing there and it's weird. 

All his mates make him out to be a player and he's previously had a reputation of a lot of hookups and casual sex, and someone did warn me of that. But he's actively declined sex or hooking up. He has kept me close for 6 months and I can count on one hand the days we've not spoken. 

He's been really really hurt in his previous long term relationship and said it fucked him up. That ended back end of last year. Part of me is so confused, and part of me thinks he's avoidant, or just really scared to fuck up. He tells me he wants to settle down and he's scared he's not going to find someone. He mentioned a date with someone right at the start of us talking and said she was too smart and pretty for him and it didn't work. He always calls me a brain box. 

I know he has hinge because he got a notification while we were hanging out and he made a point to put his phone on DND and has never brought it up. I'm also 99% certain he knows I have feelings for him. 

So what is this? A player, a user, someone terrified of the realness of what I am? An avoidant? Can someone help make it make sense. ",1,1749647303.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7oluxk/my_35f_husband_36m_is_burned_out_and_cant_work_in/)**: January 6, 2018**

**Title:** My \[35F\] husband \[36M\] is burned out and can't work in his normally high-paying field. I'm resenting having to go back to work to support us. Help!

This is part genuine request for perspective/opinions and part getting it off my chest.

To sum up, my husband and I have been married 10 years. We have a good marriage and have never faced any truly difficult times. It’ll be difficult to explain everything that goes into this, but I’m happy to expound in the comments.

Basically, the last decade has largely been focused on achieving financial independence. I had never been a very business-oriented person until I met my husband. He is extremely entrepreneurial and his passion for it is catching. We have run our own businesses together and separately throughout our marriage. The goal has always been to make enough money on location-independent businesses we can live freely. Not necessarily retire, but be have more freedom. Because of his encouragement, I am now on a career path that could easily result in that.

In 10 years, we have moved 25 times, all because better opportunities have presented themselves or current opportunities have dried up. We’re now facing #26 with #27 not far away because #26 doesn’t look like that good of a prospect.

Without giving away details, my business fluctuates greatly. I’ve had months where I pull in mid-5 figures and long stretches of a few hundred. My “career” outside of this is food service with a very definite wage ceiling. My husband’s “career” is professional and he can easily find a 6-figure salary position. His current online business currently brings in low 4-figures. We have always relied on his going back to work when money runs low. He's in high demand, can practically snap his fingers and get a job. I... cannot.

Here’s the conflict (and where I’ll try to eliminate as much of my bias as possible). My husband is completely burned-out. He physically and emotionally can’t deal with the stress of going to work right now. He has supported me through the last couple years when my income has been low. I’ve always been aware of my financial contribution and make up for it by carrying the grand majority of the household chores. Even when I was working 60+ hours as a manager (and pulling in half his wage). But as our savings are dwindling, it’s looking more and more like I’ll have to get a job. That means pushing my business to the backburner, working a physically demanding job, all for a quarter of the pay he could get.

I’m not one to spend money. We didn’t have a wedding. We bought my wedding band three years after we got married. I cut my own hair. I work from home in sweatpants. It’s not as though I’ve forced him to work jobs he hates in order to provide me with an extravagant lifestyle. I have worked shit jobs to help provide for us in the past and even when my business isn’t earning a ton, I still put in 50+ hours a week.

I’m craving stability. Not permanence, just the feeling that I can unpack our boxes and not feel like I should save them in a closet knowing in 6-9 months I’ll need them again. We’ve been child-free for years, but the last couple years the topic has been coming up more and more. Yet I feel it’s impossible to even discuss the idea of starting a family in the face of such uncertainty. I miss my cats (they’re living with my parents overseas). I want a fish tank and a place to hang pictures.

He says, “If you want those things, then make them happen.” Which, fair enough. I completely agree with. I don’t want to rely on him to provide the life I want, however it leaves me feeling a combination of emotions I can’t really put a word to. I find myself going through mental exercises of, “What would I do in this situation if I were single? How would I support myself?” and I start to feel resentful. I’m NOT single. I’m married. And not only that, I'm not sure I CAN make enough money to support us.

I desperately want him to find what it is he’s meant to do. I don’t care about the money or the dreams of financial independence if it means he’s miserable trying to get there. He’s been trying to work out which direction to change to for the past year and has yet to come up with anything solid. I know it’s all about give and take, but I can’t help but feel… I don’t know. I don’t have the words. And I’m at a complete loss as to how we resolve this.

(BTW, we have talked about all of this about 1,957 times already. There is nothing written here he hasn’t heard before.)

TL;DR – Husband has always been the primary earner with well-paying jobs, but has experienced serious burn-out. As we’re eating into our savings, it looks like I’ll have to put my business on hold and go back to work. Our discussions about steps forward have left me feeling resentful about our roles in the relationship. Am I being a spoiled brat about it all?

**EDIT**: I appreciate all the comments and opinions. This got a lot more response than I expected. Just a few things. It's difficult to sum up an entire life in a few hundred words.

**-** The moves have been for varied and obviously with 25 of them, multiple reasons. Some were because my husband was offered a good job. Others were to be nearer family.

**-** I've been pursing my side business for the last 3.5 years. The 7 prior to that I was in full time employment, sometimes working a full time job while also helping to run our own business. He has not financially supported me for 10 years.

**-** I'm not sure where people got MLM from, but I'm in a creative field. As I said, I don't want to reveal details, but I create products and then sell them online. We are not scam artists nor do we have to leave town because people are catching on to our pyramid scheme, lol...

**-** As far as financials go, again, it's impossible to sum up 10 years of income. But we go through feast and famine periods... times when money is flowing in and times when we live off what we've earned. We never live outside our means and when money is good, we put thousands a month away to prepare for the down times. It's not a typical way of living so I understand it's not easily relatable.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter:

It sounds like he has finally burnt out from being the one in the relationship to be the financial rock. That is exhausting after a while. It's great that it has allowed you the freedom to try your hand at myriad other things, but it put a lot of pressure on him.

>it looks like I’ll have to put my business on hold and go back to work

That is a very telling statement. Your business hasn't provided the work that you need to contribute equally. His has. It looks like it's time for you to step up and do the work and not the business, for now.

I think you need to just suck it up and work for now and get him into counseling. Then, you two REALLY need to sit down and figure out a different way to live. You've tried this path for 10 years and it's not working. You need to figure out a way to have stability as a couple, that doesn't burn one or the other of you out. See a career counselor and a financial counselor.

>**OOP:** (downvoted) I readily hold my hands up and say I have a spoiled streak. I guess it would be a lot easier for me to accept going back to work if he had an idea, an inkling... of what his next steps would be.  
But maybe that's just it. His job right now is to get better.

*OOP clarifies again:*

>I know it isn't clear in my original post, but it's not like I'm sitting around doing nothing all day. I easily put in more work on my business than he does on his PLUS take care of the domestic stuff. I'd like to think there is more to the balance of a relationship than financial contribution. And there have been times I have financially supported us... it hasn't always been one-sided.  
I work hard to try and change it but I guess the reality is, it isn't changing right away.

Commenter: So...you both have entrepreneurial side businesses and full time jobs? Plus moving every 3-6 months for the last ten years?

That would burn anybody out. I know financial independence is a dream...but it seems like if both put down roots (maybe for a specified time, like 4 years) and found stability, burn out wouldn't be a factor. Financially and emotionally, starting over takes a toll.

>**OOP:** We go back and forth when it comes to the full-time employment. Because of his high salary and short life-span when working, it's been more like 6 months on, several months off... but there is always a side business. Always, lol.

*Savings clarification:*

>When I say savings are dwindling... there is a lump of money in the savings account that we never, ever touch and treat as the rock bottom. We never get close to that amount, so in my mind, what we have to live off in ""savings"" is running out. When we budget, we don't feel like we're doing well unless we're able to put money away at the end of the month.  
After 10 years of working we are definitely not where either of us would like to be. That's not to say the experiences and ups and downs weren't worth it. I honestly don't think it's in my husband to buckle down with a 9-5 job and squirrel away money for retirement. I have always been happy to help him pursue his goals of owning/running his own businesses because I have faith in him.  
It's clear after talking through this on here, we're at a fork in the road.

Commenter: Your husband is about to hit rock bottom and you're not far behind. That money was saved for emergencies. This situation is not that different than your husband being temporarily disabled. At the very least you need to consider touching it.

>**OOP:** I appreciate the way you put that. It makes it easier to lock onto in my mind, thank you.

Commenter: It sounds like both of you, like a lot of people who don't much care for the 9-5 but do work hard when you find your inspiration, don't know how to plan for self maintenance. \[...\]

So my question to you is, are both of you really using your time and enthusiasm wisely? Staying put for 2 years is absolutely nothing in the grand scheme of things. Making a plan to say get to X level of income then investing in a place in South America and making that your 6 month home base where you go between looking for opportunities in your own country, is also an option. It would give you a solid place to paint the walls and unbox, and cut in expenses while you stay there.

>**OOP:** I relate to this completely. I'm completely guilty of not building in time to recover and relax. In fact, over Christmas was the first time I've taken away from my work in three years. I believe part of my resentment is misguided toward my husband our situation because I poured so much of myself into grabbing onto success. When it hasn't worked out, I feel like 1) a failure and 2) like I could've done more.  
Your last point has been something I've suggested over the last year, as a compromise of sorts, so it's interesting to read someone suggest it :) Thank you

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9tdkqa/for_years_my_35f_husband_37m_said_that_if_i_want/) **1: November 1, 2018 (a bit less than 10 months later)**

I'm writing partly to sort all this out in my head and partly for outside perspectives - I don't even know what to think anymore. Again, I'm happy to explain any details that need fleshing out if it helps. I'll try to be concise and I truly appreciate you reading.

9 months ago, I posted asking for help about my frustration with going back to work after my husband burned-out in his career (previous post in my history). For the sake of anonymity, I tried to be vague with the details and many thought our work was on the dodgy side. I don't care about keeping it anonymous... all these factors are relevant. I'm an author - I self-published books and made a decent living doing it for several years. My husband is a software developer and mainly buys existing online companies, and fixes them up to sell. When that's not working, he tries to work a 'normal' 9-5, but typically lasts no more than 6 months. His last attempt was 1 day. My career before this was in the food industry, which means crap pay, long hours and very sore feet.

I got a job that pays 95% of the bills (the rest is covered by savings). Yeah, I'd rather be working for myself, but I like it. I'm good at it. It's the first time I actually enjoy going to work. For the last few months, I've been slowly changing and it feels like my husband and I are drifting apart. At first I thought it was a natural phase, things will definitely feel different compared to working under the same roof all day and night. Now... I don't know. From the previous thread:

>He says, “If you want those things, then make them happen.” Which, fair enough. I completely agree with. I don’t want to rely on him to provide the life I want, however it leaves me feeling a combination of emotions I can’t really put a word to. I find myself going through mental exercises of, “What would I do in this situation if I were single? How would I support myself?” and I start to feel resentful. I’m NOT single. I’m married. And not only that, I'm not sure I CAN make enough money to support us.

I AM making enough money to support us and if feels *good.* It's given me confidence in a way I haven't had before. But, it's also made something glaringly obvious in our relationship... we disagree on just about everything AND we have very little in common.

I'm happy to work on my writing on the side while I work. He thinks I've given up on our dream and have settle for a world (the 9-5, M-F world) he is loathe to spend time in. He sold his business and is still figuring out what he wants to do next. I want to buy a flat in the city. He wants to move to the country, or use our savings to travel or live remotely. I want to settle for a while and make friends. He thinks there's plenty of time for that in the future. I want to make our home cosy and put up decorations like photos and artwork. While he likes it, he thinks of it all as just pointless stuff we shouldn't waste money on. I could go on, but you get it. It feels like literally everything I like, he hates.

I've also realized that most of the moves, most of the big *big* decisions were things I went along with. I'm not saying he bullied me or anything, just that I didn't feel too strongly one way or the other, so tended to go with what he wanted. Of course we talked about it, but it rarely was me pulling in the bulk of the income so I didn't feel like I had much of a say. Now I feel strongly about a life direction *and* have the ability to make it happen, and I feel... guilty? He says I've changed, that he's the same as he's been, wants the same things he's always wanted. This is me altering the situation, which I agree with. But it's not like it's this massive bait and switch plan. Our entire marriage I've talked about settling down... I'm rambling.

Here's the way I see it. We both love each other and genuinely want to make the other happy, which is why over 10 years, we've both compromised on choices that go against what we individually want. He goes to work for a little while so I can have a semi-stable home. I bounce around the world with him so he can discover himself and his career. But our tolerance for these periods have become too short to manage. He physically can't work for another person. I want to scream when I think about packing up my stuff and starting over again. Have we just spent so much of our marriage being distracted by the exciting newness of moving and pushing for financial independence, we didn't notice how little we have in common otherwise? I can't help but feel like this is on me - not my fault, per se, but on my shoulders. I'm the one rocking the status quo and if I want things to balance out, it's up to me to adjust my expectations.

TL;DR – Things in my marriage have shifted drastically since I started working again. For years, my husband said that if I want stability in our life, I have to make it happen. I did. And now things are worse than ever.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: (quoting some of OOP's post) These seem like fundamental incompatibilities...

>**OOP:** They really do, don't they.

Commenter: They do, love. This is a really unconventional way to look at it, but if you met your husband now as a new relationship, would you be excited about the guy? Interested? Would he make you laugh and make your coffee just the way you like it? I'm not saying we all should hold our partners to the standards of the honeymoon stage of a relationship, but we should be in a relationship where we at least are attracted to each other and have basic values and preferences that are compatible.

EDIT - p.s. I think it's really cool that you have a job that you enjoy AND you are a writer!

>**OOP:** Thank you :) I consider myself incredibly lucky to have both.  
I've often posed your question to myself, would we get together now as a new relationship. I think I'd still adore his passions and perspective on life - they're intoxicating. He's a sweet guy, always looking out for me and remembers little things I like. He has a habit of giving me a kiss when he leaves the room, even if he's just going away for a half hour. Obviously, I could go on. I really think we need to go talk to someone professionally... thank you for reading \*hug\*

*To a longer* [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9tdkqa/comment/e8vmco9/?context=3)**:**

Before I get lost in my own selfish thoughts, I want to wish you luck with your businesses! It's not easy, and I have loads of love for people who hustle for their passion :)

The friends and roots things is a real sore point for me. Our whole marriage we've been firmly childfree. The last two years, we had a last blast of 'are we actually sure we're sure' which threw up a lot of discussions about the future and what we envision. We're sure. No kids. But that means if I want a network of people near and around me, I have to work to make that happen. I have no family and his family is ambivalent about seeing each other. All my friends have become acquaintances because of the moving. I see this lonely life ahead of me with no one in it and that scares me.

I just wish, and I know how ludicrous it sounds as I write it, but I just wish the normal life he could build with me would be enough for him. We could have an amazing, stable life full of traveling and friends and everything people dream of. But he sees getting a job as trading his life - his time - for money... and that's not a deal he wants to make.

Thank you for your reply and I really do wish you luck.

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l35k1r/update_7_years_later_for_years_my_35f_husband_37m/) **2: June 4, 2025 (6.5 years later, more than 7 from OG post)**

I was recently cleaning out my bookmarks and [found this old throwaway](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9tdkqa/for_years_my_35f_husband_37m_said_that_if_i_want/), and obviously the two posts I made with it. I'm not sure why now, but I feel compelled to write a followup. Maybe it'll give people the bravery to change or at least an example of how sticking with what you know isn't always the best choice.

An obviously very long story short, with the help of those posts and a lot of long nights of thinking, I left my husband. In fact, it took him going away for a long weekend to realize how much happier and at peace I felt without him around... At first the split was amicable, but looking back I think he was just waiting for me to come rushing back to him once I ""realized my mistake."" When that didn't happen and he could see I was actually serious about building a new life for myself, a switch flipped. We only spoke when he needed something from me and eventually that stopped too. Enough about him.

I'm now 42, happier and healthier and more satisfied than I've been my whole life. I picked me and that was the best choice I could've ever made. I lived alone for the first time and my god, the peace of having my own space... unrivaled. I ended up staying in that apartment for 5 years, not a moving box in sight. I put art on the walls, I knew my neighbors. I made a home. I grew my career and went back to school. Made friends, built a little community.

I've done a ton of therapy and realized that the abusive patterns my parents created in childhood were just repeating with my ex. I fell in love, a real love, a supportive love that encourages growth and security. I'm doing new work, work that helps people and is so much more than just chasing money. All of those things have created a life that's more rewarding than I ever thought possible for myself.

I've gone through some really shitty times too, illness, cancer scares, deaths, loss... but I have no idea how I would've come out the other side without the community I'd built around me. Even something as simple as people at your local coffee shop recognizing you is a comfort after feeling adrift and alone for so long. Anyway, if I were to respond to myself from 7 years ago, this is what I would say.

>Leave the loser. He doesn't care about you, never did. He only cares about what you can do for him and now that you aren't serving him... well. Just go. You are capable of doing difficult things, and you are worthy of the work it takes to accomplish them. Trust your abilities, trust your gut - it's been screaming at you for years now, honey. Life can be so much more than you've experienced, but you have to make it happen for yourself.

**TL;DR:** Left my husband, happier than ever.

**EDIT**: I'm surprised but happy this found so many people! I genuinely thought I was going to bookend this story and have it disappear into the ether. But whatever urge I had to write it, and whatever brought you to reading it... who knows? Maybe it was meant to. Thank you for all the messages and comments, I feel so grateful to have this perspective and experience.",826,1749647228.0,BestofRedditorUpdates,85,0.98,False

I'm trying to remember the name of a film I saw around 10 years ago, probably on a channel like Telecine Cult. It was a low-key indie drama, spoken in English, set in a big city — possibly New York.

The main character was a slim woman with straight, medium-length black hair. She worked in a casual setting (I think a coffee shop or something similar). She would often draw what she observed around her — small everyday scenes and people in her neighborhood — in a little sketchbook, maybe around 6x4 inches (15x10 cm).

At some point in the film, she casually becomes pregnant and chooses to have an abortion. This wasn’t dramatized too heavily — it felt quiet, personal, and realistic.

The emotional high point of the film is when she holds an **art show/exhibition at night**, displaying the same sketches, now framed and hanging in a real gallery. I clearly remember people walking through the gallery and looking at the artwork. I think the man she had been involved with (the one related to the pregnancy) was also at the exhibition, perhaps as a guest — it felt meaningful, like a quiet resolution.

There was little to no classical soundtrack, and the film had a clean, quiet, urban aesthetic — which is why it stuck with me. It felt intimate, reflective, very much in the vein of 2000s–early 2010s indie cinema. Definitely not amateur, but not a mainstream release either.

If this rings a bell for anyone, I’d be incredibly grateful. 🙏",1,1749646995.0,indiefilm,0,1.0,False

I was initially nervous about managing such a large group, but I wanted to share our experience and a bit of our itinerary in case it helps others planning a similar trip. We were traveling from Chicago and had only been to France once before.

# Paris (4 Days)

We stayed at **Hotel Ekta** in the 8th arrondissement. Paris has strict occupancy rules, but this hotel was perfect—clean, with good service and a bunk bed setup that worked well for our family.

We used the **Metro** frequently, which was affordable and easy to navigate. We loaded rides onto a Navigo card as needed, and the experience was smooth.  There helpful workers at all train stations to answer any questions and also help with loading the Navigo cards.  

# Day-by-Day Itinerary:

**Arrival Day – Arc de Triomphe**  
We visited the Arc de Triomphe shortly after arriving. We bought tickets on-site and were able to go to the top without a long wait.

**Day 2 – Eiffel Tower + River Cruise**  
We had 9:30 AM tickets to the Eiffel Tower (purchased a week ahead by switching our computer clock to Paris time). We arrived at 9:00 AM and were on the second elevator to the top. It was a fantastic experience for everyone. We bought River Cruise tickets the same day, since we weren’t sure of our schedule, and it worked out perfectly.

**Day 3 – Disneyland Paris**  
We loved Disneyland! It’s quite different from Disney World in the U.S.—some things are better, some not—but the experience was far less stressful. A truly magical day.

**Day 4 – Louvre + Luxembourg Gardens**  
We had 9:00 AM tickets for the Louvre. It was hard getting the kids up early, but it made a huge difference. Minimal crowds and almost no wait. We did a self-guided tour, and the kids were surprisingly engaged for nearly two hours. They absolutely loved it.  
Afterward, we went to **Luxembourg Gardens** for the sailboats. The weather was perfect. We paid 8 euros per boat, and watching the kids sail their hand-picked boats was unforgettable. In my opinion, Luxembourg Gardens is a must-do.

**Paris Tip:**  
The best advice I can give is to visit major attractions **early in the morning**. It significantly reduced our stress and made every experience more enjoyable. Also, don’t over-schedule. Even with kids, the best part of Paris is simply walking around, taking it in, and finding somewhere nice to eat.

# Provence (6 Days in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence)

We took the **TGV train to Avignon** and rented a car for our stay in **Saint-Rémy-de-Provence**. The kids absolutely loved the train ride.  I can’t stress enough how much we loved Saint-Rémy. Choosing a town in the South of France was difficult with so many great options, but this one was exactly what we hoped for.

We rented a house through **Provence Holidays**—a fantastic company. Our daily rhythm was simple and relaxing:

* Morning walks into town for pastries, coffee, and breakfast
* One activity or excursion each day
* Afternoons at the house pool
* Dinner in Saint-Rémy or a nearby town

# Highlights from Provence:

* **Les Baux-de-Provence** – We explored the castle and the Carrières de Lumières. Bought tickets on-site. The kids loved both.
* **Le Petit Roman** – A 90-minute horseback ride through stunning scenery. Highly recommended.
* **Bleu Evasion (Marseille)** – Incredible experience. We did a 4.5-hour boat tour with swimming stops in the Calanques. An absolute highlight.
* **Saint-Rémy Wednesday Market** – This exceeded expectations and was one of the best markets we’ve been to.

The slower pace in Saint-Rémy was a refreshing change after Paris, but we truly enjoyed both parts of the trip. Taking the train instead of flying helped reduce stress, especially with kids.

We were nervous about how this trip would go, especially with a group of seven, but it exceeded all expectations. I can’t recommend this kind of trip enough..

1l8rz51,https://www.reddit.com/r/ROCD/comments/1l8rz51/rocd_or_not/,ROCD or not -,"Hello everyone, 
What life would be without anxiety, depression and probably ROCD.
I am here to share my side of the story and say that I am in my most vulnerable and sad times of my life.
I never experience this before and to be honest it is so consuming to be thing about this 24/7. 
I am in my computer working, I am thinking about my relationship and what I don't feel about my partner.
I am watching tv and look at him and ask my self why do I feel detached, what do I feel bored? Does this mean I am not in to him? And the. Go into a rabbit hole.
This started on November 2023 when I boyfriend at the time told he loved my for the first time, I said I loved him back and we kept cuddling. I still overthink about that day, and keep asking my self if I really meant I or notor what is just pretending to live him? 
That same date I had my first panic attack, It started like this. I felt a sharp pain in my chest and a million heart palpitations by the simply thought that I felt I didn't love him and everything shut down, I throwed up, had diarrhea, shaking and my heart felt like it was going to explode. I could bear with the thought that I didn't feel like I love him, and stated to questioned everything.i felt a deep amount of guilt, horrible person and broke up with him. I felt horrible like I was hurting the person that care the most about me and I am here feeling like I don't love him and breaking up with him. We both cried and then I came into depression and anxiety. Now that I think back I do remember feeling like I didn't feel butterflies or infatuated and assumed that that is why I didn't love him. I truly felt so disconnected, I was consumed by doubts, I even doubted u love the dogs, my mother and of course my self. 
Mind you, the times where I have felt like that is when or in love, infatuated when I was with a man that did not love and treated like trash, he had a gf and I was the other option. He cheated on her with me, for a very long time. I felt like I really love him even though he didn't love me back, he always made me feel like he just used me to be honest or at least that I how I felt.  Eventually, I moved to the US and met my ex, this one really fucked me up.
I was with him for almost 6 years. We met online, had sex on the first date and then I was in love. 
He never wanted anything serious with and boy!  he proved he did not want to be serious with me, he used me. It was an on on off relationship where he would be with tons and tons of girls, I and I would beg him to be with me, yes I would beg. It was very toxic too, he would me feel like I was the last option, the least attractive, he would tell me that I looked and taker so Ecuadorian and that I should feel provide led to be with a person like him. An intelligent man with a Math degree. He would tell me that he could choose to be with a higher class woman, with an education goals and thrive and I believed all of that and more. I was so miserable, I hated my self really and felt depressed and never looked for help. I always felt like I needed to have money a degree and basically be perfect should he could accept me and love.
Never it crossed through my mind that I actually needed to seek help. I think I just went to one therapy session that cost me a lot of money. Thinking back I was very depressed but I never had anxiety, never. I just felt disconnected, numbed and exhausted. I had zero motivation. He broke up with me so many times and I would beg him to be with me. It was the most horrible thing to do, I lost myself completely. 
Eventually, he left me and by an act of God we had an argument and slowly I became detached, I felt like I don't love him anymore and that never really did. The amount of emotional distress that I endured during and after the break up really took a toll on me. 
Not to mention that I discovered I had G herpes bc of him and literally went into withdrawal and more depression and shame, so much shame. Truly felt like I was never met anyone that would accept that. I judge myself so bad that I didn't open up and just had casual encounters with men. Tho was probably 2013-2022
Moving forward to 2023, where I met my now husband. We met in February on a coffee date that lasted almost 5 hours. We had breakfast and then we went for a walk. We talked about everything, kids what we want family. I remember feeling a bit scared that this man was instered in me, almost like I could believe that he was actually into me. We went to several dates and everything was fine, I felt safe to be with him. Really, he would treat me so good, I always questioned that why he treated me good. I also kinda was expecting for him to to get rid of me, it was almost like I was s worried that he would me like sometimes I forgot to be present. I remember the first time I cooked for fun, I was so nervous, I cared about him I cared that he liked me, I wanted to impress him with my cooking skills lol, and I did. 
Moving forward, my dad passed away of a stroke and it felt like a numbing pain that just doesn't go away. I was sad but I don't think I coped with it very well. 

Now to the part where my now husband told me that he loved me, I truly felt like a made a mistake because I felt I didn't love him back and started questioning how I felt when I was other two exes. I compared my feeelings and I just couldn't shake it off, I feet so guilty and such a horrible person for hurting this man  that truly loves me. 
That day I went to work and kept having intrusive thoughts, the same one that I felt I didn't love him and will have a panic attack just by thought and then I will get this cumpulsiob of breaking up because u thought that was the solution.
Eventually I got a therapist and psychiatrist and gave me medications since. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and general anxiety.
With therapy, I did feel better and came to the my senses that I made a horrible mistake. I thought that I really did not know what was I thinking I love my boyfriend. 
The therapy was okay; however it just felt like I'd dint really learn how to cope with my anxiety or learned about techniques.
I found the breathing and 5-5-5 rule by looking a YouTube channels. 
Anyhow, since I started feeling okay I know realized that Ibshould have stopped therapy but I did. 

This thing of intrusive thoughts have happened too many times, it happened in my first trip with my bf and on my honey moon. 
In my head I feel that I need to have this feelings all the time, that basically I need to have a perfect relationship and that I need to feel absolutely certain that I love him. That I what I am looking for. Certantity I want to be sure all the time always. 
My thoughts are that if we don't soend time together all the time well that means we are compatible, 
That because we don't have sex right now, that means amour relations is over 
That because I did not feel like I am in love all the time well then I need to break up. In my head I need to have a perfect relation in order to be certain and yes I know that is not realistic but now I just don't know how to cope with this. Because it feels so real
We are married now, and my intrusive thoughts right now are not  here, they were there last week, I started reading a book about RoCd and considered that I might be diagnosed with that, and I identified with some of it, and started doing those cognitive distorsión exercise and it got worse. That now I only feel like I don't love my parter anymore and therefore I believe in ny head I don't have Rocd, because once again the feeling feels so fucking real. I get thisbcumplaion to break up and leave. 
Because I feel that I I don't love him and don't want to hurt him anymore. 
I told my husband this and I know I broke his heart and I feel so horrible so saying this but it feels so real that I don't love him anymore and the feeling kills me. After I said it I still feel horrible and feel like I  making the right decisions but I gave him into an compulsion from fear and that can't be right 

I want to feel again and right now I feel like I can't get out of it, I have been the longest I have been like that and it feels like I am forever doomed. 
Last month I was fine I felt so happy that I would wake up and tell him how happy and estable I felt. 
And now a month later when we stopped my meds bc we are trying t conceive we decided that we would not take them, but I just go on a spiral and feel so hopeless.

I feel that my depression come from the Intrusive thoughts but right now in this very moments it feels like I don't have any instrusuive thoughts and it is just one feeling that don't love my partner anymore and need to break up and leave.

Why this happens to me, why I can't be content and happy with a man that loves deeply.
Why I have to feel that I don't love him when I long for this so much.

I’ve dropped dairy and soy but really haven’t seen a huge difference yet. This morning I had my coffee at 7 (one regular sized mug), fed him at 8 and he was instantly spewing directly after our feed. That’s when a light bulb went off. 

I’ve always seen and heard that up to 200mg of caffeine is fine for most breastfeeding mothers. I’m a long time coffee drinker and had it all throughout my pregnancy. I only have one regular sized mug and sometimes a small top up at around 10am. I use nondairy creamer in my coffee. 

Other than the reflux and spitting up, he is usually gassy and fussy around feeds. He gains weight every wk and doesn’t have eczema or any of the other telltale signs of dairy allergy. Nevertheless, ive eliminated dairy and soy because that is what we’re told to do. 

Have any of you dropped the coffee/ caffeine and seen a difference in reflux or fussiness? I’ve seen many posts on here about women claiming they drink coffee all day long and baby sleeps perfectly and isn’t fussy. Wondering if anyone else has experienced the opposite.

I know this is a long shot, but I can’t shake this moment from my mind. Earlier today (June 11), at Zürich Hauptbahnhof, we shared something subtle but unforgettable. You were walking along - close to the train platforms — and we kept catching each other’s eyes. Not just once or twice, but several times. Each time we looked, you smiled — that really cute, genuine smile — and I couldn’t help but smile back.

There was this quiet back-and-forth between us, just through our eyes and smiles. It felt like we were both aware of it, like we both noticed something a little out of the ordinary in that moment. Even as you walked away, I looked back — and you did too. That second (or maybe third?) glance and that final smile stuck with me the rest of the day.

You were Asian, with a calm and lovely presence. I think you were wearing a light-colored jacket, and your hair was down. I was the guy in short brown hair, probably looking both captivated and a little stunned by how naturally that connection happened.

If you’re reading this — or if someone you know mentioned something like this today — I’d love to talk. Maybe grab a coffee, or just hear what the moment felt like for you. And if it was just a passing bit of joy between two strangers, that’s fine too. But I had to at least try.

Thanks for reading.

I literally can't help it and it's embarrassing. I've even resorted to sitting in my car and making long noises in as low a tone as possible in private to try and loosen the vocal cords up.

I have been going to the gym for a month 4 times a week. As you can tell from my height and weight, I'm trying to put on some weight. My goals is to reach 75 kg. I did some calculations depending on my job and weekly exercise. I'm working 35 hours a week as a sales assistant in a restaurant. The restaurant is something like fast food chain but more conventional(Nordsee). I have to prepare the sandwhiches for snacks window, fish for the restaurant if needed, sitting is not allowed so I stay on foot for 7 hours plus I have a 30 minute break in between.

Depending on these calculations I decided to take between 3400- 3800 calories a day. My macros are 120 - 140 grams protein(most of the times I can easily exceed the amount), 110- 130 grams fat, 480 - 500 grams of carbs. I always try to hit 500 grams carb as protein and fat's are easy to achieve. I can eat only 3 times a day since I'm not allowed to eat anything during my job except during my break. However I'm allowed to drink. So I prepare high calorie shakes with 1 banana, 100 gr oats, 200 ml milk, 30- 40 gr honey, 20 gr peanut butter(if I need more calories as fats), 20 gr almonds, I also add some water to make the consistency smoother so that it's easy to drink . I do it 2 times a day, otherwise taking this much carbs is unlikely for me.

On my first week when I started gym I lost 0.5 kg weight although I was eating 3500 calories, then I started to gain the weight slowly now I'm 62,3(I weigh myself in the morning after going bathroom without any clothes).To be honest it's not that hard to eat with the help of shakes.

On the supplement side I take 5 gr of creatine, mangesium&zinc capsules, omega 3 capsules and protein powder if I need to meet my daily protein needs. Plus coffeine 1 capsule(200 mg coffeine) before workout as coffee sometimes makes my stomach as if it's burning.

My question is, am I taking too much carb or maybe protein? Is taking around 1700 as liquid calories unhealthy? I'm not writing this post because I didn't see any 5kg increase in 1 week or 10 kg muscle mass increase. I'm writing it to know whether my macro goals are healty for a person who weights 62kg before continuing to eat this much.

We talk for about 3hrs on phone call that day, and we decided it's better to not talk again. Ofcourse I had JEE studies and all, so did she. Fast forward to yesterday, I went to her house to give sweets after my JEE results. I went with the same friend who came with me to her house back in 2023, it was quite nostalgic. We sat at the exact places we did last time. Only difference was that they served us hot coffee this time, instead of cold lol. Yea, rest all was same. I still felt the same about her.

Note: Introduction missing. This picks up in the Fall 2024. I make no claims to the validity or truth of the following. In some places, I might lie. Consider me an unreliable narrator in even the best of cases or scenarios. But also know that I’m not lying outright either. This story is true, even if the details might not be. And remember that I said might. Twice.

I’m going to show you one method of crippling me as a person.

Take two aspects of my personality and have them charge at each other head to head at full speed. We’ll say that one represents my core identity as a hot-blooded man with desire and want of companionship; we’ll say that other represents my moral compass and core identity as being a protector and guardian.

At the beginning of November 2024, I was banned from the website. I had an issue with a creator, and I initiated a chargeback, a dispute over a payment. The sum of money was almost paltry, but it was a “principle of the thing” situation. Still, it was more than I would pay at the time to regain admission, and some time away was exactly what I needed to iron out a few recent issues that had come up.

Mira and I had a mostly transactional relationship from the moment I met her until Fall. We would chat briefly around encounters, but we generally avoided getting too in depth or spending too much time talking. That all changed in October. My presence was sparse over the summer, but I popped back up in September, and she and I spoke again. She was pleased to hear from me, as far as I could tell.

I’m not sure when exactly or how exactly it happened, but she and I started to chat well beyond the scope of anything we had done previously. I found myself messaging her while waiting in line at a drive-through. We talked while I shopped for groceries. It was gradual. It was pleasant.

A quick note: at the time this happened, I was living in rural Louisiana. The closest place where any social mixing occurred was a gas station 10 minutes by car from my house. Also, my job put me in the middle of nowhere for extremely long stretches of time. At night. I worked six days on, then got three days off. On my work days, I’d typically wake at 2, leave the house at 5pm, and get to work for 7pm at small boat launches in rural sections of Louisiana. I’d get off at 6am, drive to our company warehouse, and limp home by about 8am. I’d usually collapse in bed by 9:30 or so. Long workdays with long drives and not enough sleep for 6 days in a row.

On top of that, none of these places, or the routes to them, were rife with opportunities to chat up anyone. I didn’t see an attractive barista at a coffee shop. No pleasant woman walking her dog at the same time I did. And my “coworkers” were other river rat guys like me.

On my days off? That first day, I was lucky if I could limp further than the sofa. The rest of the time was spent trying to spend time with my daughter, who I would have full time on the weekends, taking care of my personal life maintenance, attempting to stay in some type of shape, and helping maintain the property and house. I was lucky to make it into the city just one night. And being awake and at work all night, my schedule was opposite as far as the social calendar goes with most of my friends and family.

Put plainly, I was fucking lonely. And I like talking to attractive women.

People like to paint the typical OF user as simp incel dudes who have zero experience with women. At this point in my life, I was a few years removed from a divorce following a 10-year relationship, with a few girlfriends and more casual acquaintances on either side of that.

And put plainly, I was more than a little bit of a slut during some of my formative years.

Apply a little logic: how else does an ex-cop pushing middle age with a bank account as empty as a politician’s promise manage to capture the attention and interest of a woman half his age on the other side of the globe?

It’s dirt simple. I know how to hold a conversation. With people, and occasionally women. About any number of topics.

We started talking regularly now. We’d talk at various times throughout the day and while I enjoyed it, when the ban happened, I lost touch with her, and I didn’t particularly enjoy that.

So I started looking for other ways of contacting her online, potentially via social media.

What I quickly learned was that she was practically nonexistent online in any capacity that I could work with. I found countless websites with pirated images of her. I found a Twitter/X account* that appeared to be little more than a spam account. She seemed completely scrubbed from all social media. I could not find her anywhere that I could reach her. But I found a defunct account on Chaturbate, where she apparently used to do live streams. From there, I found about four names that she had used over the years, during different phases of her life online.

(*this will be important later)

So I started doing some searches with some of those other names.

This is when a nuclear bomb was shoved down my throat and detonated.

I won’t do to you what happened to me in early December.

Apparently, three women in the adult entertainment industry looked a lot like her at points in their careers. One of them looked so much like her that Google directed me to a video containing this other actress with a caption that beared one of Mira’s aliases. I opened the video.

The video contained a porn shoot of the “rough face fucking” variety, a form of extreme and degradation stuff that I’d find difficult to watch for any reason on the best of days. However, in this particular video, the actress involved did not know the specific theme of the shoot. She showed up expecting fairly vanilla/regular sex. She was not prepared. Furthermore, the male actor ignored her use of a safeword. I want to be crystal clear to everyone reading this: at that moment, the video showed a crime. Once someone withdraws consent, the fun’s over. But he didn’t stop. It still makes me ill to type this, but he continued even when she attempted, as best as she was able, for reasons I won’t fucking elaborate, to say “You’re hurting me”.

And I thought I was looking at Mira.

Let’s make it even worse, shall we? The date log on the video… would have made Mira a minor.

Without going into detail, I’ll say that I thought I was watching a woman I’d come to care about deeply… having a violent sex crime committed on her while she was a minor.

I threw up into my mouth.

Filter all of what I just said through the fact that I used to be a detective… in a section that handled sex crimes and crimes against children. That often partnered with anti-human trafficking initiatives.

All of the regular, masculine parts of me, including the aspects that desire attractive woman, and my identity as a sex crimes detective routinely square off inside my head. They can usually come to some common ground on the “protect women and children” platform. Sometimes they fight with razors and scissors in hand. 

Today? They were both dragged to a mental guillotine. My mind’s eye was blinded with a fire pocket, and my mental stage looked like a slaughterhouse floor or the scene of a seal kill on ice.

I went into a tailspin of an existential crisis on my bathroom floor. I won’t elaborate on my condition, but there were moments of me lying in a fetal position. There was a moment when I found myself whispering “I’m part of the problem” to myself over and over. I scrambled to find random pills in old prescription bottles. Anything to take a little bit of that edge away. Anything to let me leave myself alone. Anything to let me sleep.

I spent a few days after completely numbed via pharmaceuticals.

This will become common: people asked me what was wrong, and how do I explain this?

I looked up the male actor and seriously considered how difficult it would be to murder him. I found his real name and home address. I wondered. I also wondered if I had gone insane.

I don’t remember why I opened the video again, but when I did, some time later, I noticed something. The actress on screen had different tattoos. It wasn’t Mira.

Here is the transcription from the image:

[TEXT MISSING]

The relief I felt was transcendent.

Curiosity and the cat. I looked up the actress. From what I gathered, substance abuse and alcohol had become an issue for her at some point. I wondered how much the incident on screen affected it all.

I felt like a dodged not just a bullet but a rail gun. But this incident still planted a seed in me that would bear sour fruit just down the road.

She and I would talk about this incident. That conversation might be relevant later. 

Note: [Section about our differences in age]

I’ve already admitted to contemplating a murder and doing drugs. How much of a good person can I actually be?

If you were to ask Mira what she thought about this, she would probably tell you to mind your own fucking business, she’s an adult, and she’s navigated more minefields and nuances of human sexuality that any five of you combined could do in three lifetimes.

Ask her about an imbalance of power. She’ll tell you there is a massive imbalance of power, and that I never stood a chance.

December has been a historically busy time in my industry during the time of all of this. I started working upwards of 70 hours a week. I hit a few weeks where I clocked 90 hours (that includes some time and a half overtime, but still). I was averaging about three to four hours a sleep a night. I was chowing down my adderall like Tic Tacs and powering down Red Bulls like a frat pledged and cheap beer.

I was so sleep deprived that coworkers thought I was using illicit street drugs.

My behavior would often slip into the delusional. And solid as my memory is, I have to look at notes to remember specific points from that month. Things were so bad in this regard, migraines followed, and I would schedule doctor’s appointments in early January to make sure I wasn’t experiencing any neurological issues. I actually had an MRI. 
(My doctor was funny as hell. He wrote me a prescription for 8 hours sleep. We’ll hear more about him later.)

I returned to the platform on or around December 4th and contacted Mira, and she was overjoyed to hear from me. She told me that she thought that her behavior had driven me away and that she was devastated. We resumed talking, but at this point, I was messaging her throughout the day and night. Even when I knew she was sleeping, I would send her messages that I knew she would read upon waking.

I don’t which of us is “at fault”. I don’t know who slipped first. And really, assigning blame in this case might be a fool’s errand. But. She and I had often flirted with the idea that we had deeper feelings for each other, but neither of us said anything that approached more than a hint. In fact…

At the tail end of October, during a… lively exchange, I made a comment that she mistook as a precursor to my disclosing that I was in love with her. I was actually making a poorly worded attempt at claiming sexual prowess. The conversation quickly became awkward, and I felt like a child being scolded. I hadn’t said anything that I hadn’t before, so I wasn’t sure what the issue was this time or why she interpreted things that way. She even followed up with making a point of saying that we would 100% never meet in real life, of which I was completely aware.

However, not long after that conversation, it seemed like she softened her stance, dropping from “100% never meet” to “you never know”, which raised my skepticism alarm at the time. Not about anything specific. But I worked around strippers for a while, and my coworkers and I would often joke about the guys who’d enter strip clubs and fall in love. “She doesn’t love you, bro”. My guard would pop up, then fall. Pop up, fall. Repeat.

But in December, that changed. I slipped one night and said I might be falling for her. I’m sure large doses of testosterone, estrogen, vasopressin, oxytocin, dopamine, and a number of other hormones and neurotransmitters were at work. But she said she felt the same.

I remember telling her that I was considering dropping my guard and asking if that was a bad idea. She told me it wasn’t. I told her that she still had time to run if she wanted to. She said that she didn’t want to run anywhere.

By the weekend of December 14, she told me she loved me. 

I asked her something to the effect of “Do you think this is a good idea? If I let my guard down and say how I feel…are we going to regret it?” Before she could answer, with a big sloppy stupid smile on my face, I took a leap of faith, and I think I broke both legs.

I’ve taken a tour of it and I like the neighborhood a lot, from what I’ve seen (in between Sketchbook and Campagnola and across the street from the El and Metra). But I’m wondering if anyone has any specific experience with this building and/or neighborhood. Of course, the property manager sold me hard on how great it is, but that’s his job. I Googled reviews on the building and nothing came up other than descriptions of the building written by people trying to market it. 

It’s probably a long shot to find someone who has actually lived there (or currently lives there), but thought I’d give it a shot. Or, if anyone lives or has lived in that area, I’d love some opinions on what it’s like to live there. 

What it boils down to is I’m moving to Evanston from a suburb further out where I currently have a yard and I’m not sharing walls with any neighbors and I’m feeling a tiny bit of trepidation about moving back into a scenario where I’m in a more communal living space. The upsides of the area appear to be great — close to restaurants and coffee shops, much more walkable than my current situation, trains right across the street, closer to the lake, etc. But I guess I’m trying to get a sense of the downsides.

1l8reaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1l8reaf/need_advice_on_moving_on/,Need advice on moving on,"Myself (24M) and my Ex (23F) broke up recently after 2+ yrs. We had a lustful, young fun start to our romance which followed by me moving abroad for 1.5yrs. We kept things going and communication was poor (from my POV) at times - working late and then joining my roommates for a beer and waking up late having forgotten to call her that evening. I owned these mistakes and apologised for them and I was lucky that we managed to stay together. 

I came home from being away and I think the end to long distance was underwhelming for her as our relationship became pattern based and mechanical (coffees / walks / lifts to work etc) and probably could have done with more spontaneity. I was going through a rough patch myself job hunting and she was busy working to save to go on holidays for 3 months with her friends and studying for end of year exams. The night before she left she broke down in tears, explaining she had been having doubts but we reconciled and remembered that what we had was worth fighting for (IMO) and that love isn’t meant to be easy all the time. We were v compatible and had a personal and emotional connection (rather than classic ur hot I’m hot - IG couple). 

I dropped her to the airport the next morning and we said our goodbyes, both feeling stressed and anxious about what lies ahead. Whilst being away, there were lots of “I love yous” and “miss you” / when will you come and visit from her but then one morning she called and said she was stressed, anxious and couldn’t shake the doubts. 

This is a disappointing end to 2+ incredible years, but I know that I said how I felt before she left and I’m not going to beg for someone who isn’t willing to fight for something to the same extent as myself. I loved hard, but I’m smart enough to know that loving myself is more important. 

I obviously respect however she feels and I’m not too concerned about understanding exactly what has led us here from such a loving relationship (nor why in the days prior there was genuine miss you / love you / emotion shown from her - given the end game). 

I definitely don’t hate her, there was no bad blood. I could be bitter about the circumstances but I understand timing isn’t a choice in this game. Real love should be able to sail in storms, not be rocked by a breeze - I understand we had a boring / mundane few months in the lead up to this but Love isn’t just pure passion / spark 24/7, it’s effort and depth in tough times. 

I’ll be ok I’m sure, we’re both good looking, and smart and there’ll be plenty ahead for us individually. I know though that I’ll regret not having a solid POA in the coming weeks / months - this is where I need ALL THE ADVICE I can get. 

It ended amicably but almost strangely given we may never see eachother again (after such a long period). I obviously miss her / us, but I’m not naive and it’s not my job to change her mind (even though she seems to be doing it herself constantly). 

She wants to call in a few days, obviously we are 3000+ miles away from eachother and from a closure standpoint, I’ve realised she doesn’t have the emotional strength to give “us” a proper chance, so I’m content in knowing that that’s all I really need to know. 

I don’t want to be an option to her, or plead / beg, it’s not my job - if she wanted to she would’ve vibes. I also don’t want to pull some ALPHAMALE bullshit, like I respect what we had - I loved her, she loved me. I don’t need to start shitting on her / her decisions to make me 
feel better. 

But I would appreciate some advice given the intricacies above, I know the generic - hit the gym and grind stuff. What is going to give me solace and mental clarity. 

Thanks guys!

We're all drowning in information. Between endless articles, clickbait headlines, and 20-minute news segments, staying informed feels like a full-time job. Most of us end up either overwhelmed or completely out of the loop.

**Our Solution**: Personalised Audio News Briefings + Voice Interaction

We're building an app that:

✅ **Fetches and summarizes** news into <1 minute audio briefings  
✅ **Creates timeline-based context** for stories (perfect for when you've missed previous coverage)  
✅ **Delivers at YOUR schedule** \- set it for 8 AM with your coffee, or whenever works  
✅ **Voice interaction** \- ask follow-up questions, dive deeper, or get clarification just like ChatGPT Voice

# How It Works

1. **Setup**: Choose your categories (Tech, Finance, Health, etc.)
2. **Schedule**: Pick your daily briefing time
3. **Listen**: Get your personalized news summary
4. **Interact**: ""Hey, tell me more about that Tesla story"" or ""What's the context behind this?""

We're still in early development, but the core audio generation and summarization is working well. Planning to launch a beta in the next few months.

Let’s dive into some of the basics just to get them out of the way:

**About Me:**
- 28 years old from NSW, Australia.
- 174cm / 5'7 tall with an average build which is trying to find motivation to tone up a bit.
- Blue eyes and brown hair, currently in the process of growing it out and bit after waking up and having my 1/3 life crisis.
- I’m as pale as they come—so much so that I might blind you in sunlight or turn into a tomato if exposed for too long.
- I work in tech/finance, but don’t worry, I’m not a c r y p t o bro.

**Personality:**
- I’m pretty shy and anxious around new people, but once I warm up, I’m talkative and engaging.
- Introvert at heart, but I do enjoy going out with friends.
- I’m not religious and while I respect all beliefs, it might be tricky to connect with someone who is deeply religious.

**Hobbies:**
- Gaming is a big part of my life—mostly chill games, whether solo or with friends on Discord.
- Occasionally embarrass myself with a round of golf.
- Metalcore fan here! If you’re into Polaris / Thornhill / Sleep Token / etc let’s chat!
- I’ll stay up late ruining my joke of a sleep schedule to watch Piastri get closer and closer to the Aussie WDC dream.

I’ve tried various dating apps without much luck and would prefer to connect with someone in Australia. I’m looking for someone to make daily activities, like grabbing coffee or running errands, more enjoyable. Even better if we can just hang out at home and enjoy each other’s company.

But at the same time going out and travelling with someone would be amazing. I've travelled with family in the past, but I just feel like travelling with a significant other would hit different  y'know?

Recently I started making my own **meat broth** — using a whole chicken, chicken feet, and lamb bones, cooked gently for about 1.5–3 hours to avoid high histamine buildup. 

I add sea salt and apple cider vinegar during cooking.

Drinking a cup of this broth before meals seems to really help balance me out. It’s not instant, but I feel calmer, less reactive, and more grounded afterward. I think the mix of sodium, potassium, glycine, and gelatin is exactly what my system needs — and it’s all food-based, which feels safer for me.

Still dialing things in, but this broth is quickly becoming my core support tool for nervous system stability and electrolyte balance. If anyone else is dealing with similar issues on carnivore or keto

especially with histamine sensitivity or electrolyte crashes...

I highly recommend trying a simple broth like this.",2,1749644568.0,carnivorediet,3,1.0,False

***Achieving a five-month revenue growth equivalent to an annualized rate exceeding 4,000%, as the booming CBD and mushroom supplement markets-projected to reach $30 billion and $15 billion respectively by 2028-fuel strong consumer demand and industry expansion.***

**SCOTTSDALE, AZ /** [**ACCESS Newswire**](https://www.accessnewswire.com/) **/ June 11, 2025 /** CBD Life Sciences Inc. (OTC PINK:CBDL), a rising player in the natural health and wellness space, is proud to report a **1,502.30% increase in revenue** from January through May of 2025 - a historic milestone for the company and a clear reflection of its expanding presence across retail, digital, and direct-to-consumer channels.

This performance marks the company's strongest run of sustained month-over-month revenue growth to date and comes as CBDL shifts from a single-category CBD company to a diversified **wellness brand** with products designed for modern performance, recovery, and cognitive support.

""This isn't just about selling more products - it's about becoming a health brand that consumers actively seek out,"" said Lisa Nelson, President & CEO of CBD Life Sciences Inc. ""We've laid the foundation for scalable, repeatable success by combining innovation, access, and a strong identity in functional wellness.""

**Key Drivers Of Growth**

**National Retail Expansion & E-Commerce Ubiquity**  
CBDL's ability to meet consumers where they shop has been a major growth catalyst in 2025. The brand has successfully launched and scaled across high-traffic digital and physical platforms, including:

* **Walmart Marketplace:** Multiple SKUs now available online, including CBDL's best-selling **3000MG Pain Relief Cream** and skin care formulations.
* **DoorDash & Leafly:** Products are accessible via local delivery in select markets, offering speed and convenience for customers.
* **Groupon:** Strategic limited-time wellness deals driving strong first-time purchase activity and consumer discovery.
* **Shopify & Reddit:** Expanded direct-to-consumer operations through Shopify, complemented by engagement in Reddit's niche wellness communities to boost brand awareness and customer acquisition.

**Product Innovation: Functional Wellness for the Modern Consumer**

CBDL's revenue growth closely aligns with its rapid innovation across plant-powered health categories. Beyond CBD, the company is gaining traction with **functional and adaptogenic wellness products**, including:

* **Mushroom Smoothies & Brain Support Blends:** Featuring natural cognitive enhancers like **lion's mane, reishi**, and **cordyceps**, these smoothies support memory, mental clarity, and energy - and are appearing in local coffee shops and health stores.
* **Power+ Sexual Enhancement Supplement:** A plant-based formula supporting male vitality, stamina, and circulation, quickly becoming a customer favorite.
* **Adaptogenic Mushroom Supplements:** Proprietary blends designed to support immune health, stress reduction, and overall daily balance, harnessing **reishi, chaga, lion's mane**, and **ashwagandha**.

**Strategic Vision & Responsible Growth**

CBDL continues to invest in infrastructure, brand visibility, and strategic partnerships to ensure long-term sustainable growth. While focusing on the U.S. market currently, the company is evaluating future expansion opportunities and additional retail collaborations.

""Our focus remains on delivering real value through trusted products and accessible retail channels,"" added Nelson. ""We are committed to building a wellness brand that serves consumers authentically while creating shareholder value.""",3,1749643991.0,Pennystock,0,1.0,False

I stopped there once for coffee because, well, caffeine was essential, and I liked the cozy vibe.

But it wasn’t just a cafe. It was a place I imagined sharing with someone — quiet talks over warm drinks, laughter floating between the tables, little memories being made.

Now, when I went back to the uni for orientation, the cafe is closed. The windows are empty, showing the pale pink interior stripped of life. When I pass by, I can’t help but stare through the glass and feel the weight of all the moments that never happened inside that room.

It’s strange how an empty space can hold so much — like the echoes of city trips planned but never taken, photobooth pictures never snapped, events never attended together. The cafe feels like it holds those lost dreams quietly within its walls.

Back in high school, I was told my outfits made me look like a college student. Now that I’m here, my style has changed a bit, but no change in clothes can fill the emptiness that comes from missing those shared moments.

I don’t want to rewrite the past. I’ve reached some goals, and it feels unreal. But the empty cafe reminds me how some futures close silently — doors shutting softly, leaving behind silence and the ghost of what might have been.

Sometimes, it’s not just a cafe. It’s a quiet monument to things lost, to memories unmade, and to dreams that never found their place.",1,1749643972.0,lostafriend,0,1.0,False

Já havia tentado várias extrações diferentes (no caso, só possuo o coador comum, os melita 103 e a temperatura da água é no olho, mas pelo menos tenho balança, falta chegar meu V60 e maldito vendedor que ainda não enviou meu termômetro). Pesquisei bastante antes de começar, mas ainda me restaram dúvidas que me ajudaram aqui no sub, e uma coisa que me ajudou foi a própria torrefação: o blog da Coffee++. Embora hoje em dia eles falem coisas mais próximas do que vemos como “correto”, antigamente eles falavam para usar a proporção 1:10 e fazer um despejo único com a água (entre 93º-94º ou começando a aparecer bolhas). Testei esse e com um bloom, e ambos foram o que tiveram menor amargor e talvez algumas notas (embora possa ser placebo). Isso contando que também fiz o bypass. 

O que quero dizer com tudo isso é: considerando que a moagem veio bem fina (pelo que entendo), gostaria de mostrar como fiz para resolver, pelo menos em partes, a questão do amargor. Ainda farei mais alguns testes, pois tenho bastante do café ainda, e planejo atualizar aqui caso dê certo. Talvez, caso ache barato, compre um coador de pano individual, para testar e ir atualizando aqui com o tempo. Testei várias dicas do pessoal que foram ajudando também, mas quanto mais, melhor.

Edit.: esqueci de falar, mas uma coisa que acontece é que ele não tem um fluxo de café saindo, apenas pinga (rápido ou lento), mesmo tendo dois furos",4,1749643936.0,cafebrasil,5,0.84,False
