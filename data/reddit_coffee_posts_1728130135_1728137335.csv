I own a small coffee shop ""3BB Cafe"" in downtown Bethany Beach, Delaware. 

  
We are doing a renovation this off season, and are going to be basically redoing our entire spot. 

To cut to the chase, what are some things you WISH your coffee shop had? They can be as little as a particular tool, or as big as a setup that you loved OR wish your coffee shop had done differently. 

  
We want to make as many changes as possible to make our experience great for our customers AND our baristas. Thinking sustainability, ease of the job, quality control, etc. 

  
For context, we have pretty large array of offerings.

-All standard coffee drinks & some specialty ones like a Cocowater Americano, Fit Frappe, etc 

-We use Monin flavor syrups & locally roasted coffee

-We offer grab n go foods like muffins, croissants, etc. And prepared foods like warmed quiches, breakfast sandwiches, acai bowls, and smoothies. 

-Square is our POS 

-We are quick service, with community tables outside used by our customers & shared with neighboring businesses

  
Also another thing to note: Our volume of business changes an insane amount from on to off season. During the summer, we can have about 30 employees at times, and in the off season, we can have 5 - 10. ",1,1728137223.0,barista,0,1.0,False
1fwr6dj,https://www.reddit.com/r/introvert/comments/1fwr6dj/the_outcast_in_the_office/,The outcast in the office,"I'm disliked by some of my co-workers, I can tell. I'm not social enough for them. I can't just say good morning in passing in the kitchen, and quietly make my coffee without having an entire conversation sharing what we did over the weekend. Unless it's some insane story, or a really pretty plant you bought recently, I don't reeeeally care. The silence makes them uncomfortable, they don't like that, so they make small talk and fill the air with awkward laughter instead. I'm a listener, not a gossiper and they don't like that either. They brown nose eachother, and they can't stand it when I'm not in there doing the exact same.

I'm at work to do my job, not make rounds every 20 minutes to have hour long conversations about the most mundane shit, and they don't like that.

I can hold a conversation just fine... but no I don't care for The Circle on Netflix, or the Country concert that everyone in the office is attending over the weekend. 

Am I alone here when it comes to being the outcast in the workplace? 

Maybe I am an ahole? Should just suck it up and go to the Barre class all of my female coworkers go to? Or buy that expensive ice maker because that's the rage in the office at the moment?",1,1728137179.0,introvert,0,1.0,False
1fwr63o,https://www.reddit.com/r/drivingUK/comments/1fwr63o/fined_for_parking_in_mcdonalds_for_32_hours/,Fined for parking in McDonald’s for “32 hours”,"Went into McDonald’s 9am on the Monday morning for a coffee. Left immediately. Returned the following day at 5pm. Both drive throughs, didn’t park once but just got a fine saying apparently I was parked between 9am on the Monday til 5pm the next day which obviously isn’t true. They have a photo of me entering and one leaving the next day. Conveniently they’ve not included the photo of me leaving at 9.03am and coming back again at 5pm the next day 🤦🏻‍♀️

I have no photographic evidence that my car wasn’t there that whole time. I have a ring camera but obviously it had ran out of battery that week and I took my sweet arse time charging it. All I have is the screenshots of both transactions and also transactions elsewhere that I made after I left the first time and before I arrived the second time, which all show location of transaction. Will that be enough? I feel like they could just argue that me spending money elsewhere doesn’t prove I didn’t leave the car behind. Love how they mess up and it’s left to us to prove otherwise 🙃

1fwr63c,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1fwr63c/would_you_brew_stale_coffee/,Would you brew stale coffee? ,"Awhile back there was talk about resting beans for months before even starting to brew them. As someone that felt beans were best at 1-2 weeks off roast, and stale past 3-4 weeks, I wanted to test this theory. 

I didn't do it exactly the same, instead I started brewing a bag (Dak Blueberry Boom) when I usually would, and then have brewed it intermittently since then. Today it is just shy of 3 months past roast, and the cup is solid. To be sure this isn't just a factor of a lighter roast, I started the same process with a locally roasted coffee that is more medium and a different roast style, and that one being 6 weeks off roast I'm finding a similar trend in the brewing parameters and taste. 

I have ended up with brews at about a 1:13 ratio, 90°C (194° F), and switched to a flat bottom slower draining brewer with more/smaller pours. The beans have really settled in and not changed in awhile, and actually I'm enjoying the cups more consistently now than when they were fresher. They're maybe 93% what I *want*, because I'm missing a little vibrancy which I feel comes from the higher temps, but that is still quite enjoyable and better than chain coffee, and pretty on par with better coffee shops in my area. 

Benefits I'm noticing:
* more flexibility in when I purchase bags of coffee (I don't have to time it for when the coffee will have the ""right"" amount of rest)
* I don't have to resort to freezing coffee
* I get to save money because I'm not adding beans to the purge stash after 4 weeks so I'm not rotating through bags so quickly
* I get to use more of my gear (some of the brew methods like phin are better suited for the stronger ratio, and I don't often use them for lighter roasts like these, but now I can)
* I can either have fun ""chasing the dragon"" or just let a coffee rest longer for a more consistent brew experience
* which also means I can have more open bags on hand if I want. 

So, would you brew ""stale"" coffee? I did, and I think I'm a convert. ",1,1728137155.0,pourover,0,1.0,False
1fwr5vn,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1fwr5vn/why_do_they_act_like_this/,Why do they act like this?,"I met my ex yesterday to get some of my stuff back. We met in a coffee shop. She came in, dropped my things, and wanted to leave immediately. The way she handled my stuff caused my coffee to spill. It was really embarrassing because it seemed like she did it intentionally. Then she walked out the door. 

As I tried to clean up and go through my things, I noticed my passport was missing—the main reason I wanted my stuff back. I called her, but she didn't pick up. When I stepped outside the coffee shop, I saw her waiting. The first thing she did was ask me to buy her weed. I said no. I told her to go ask the guy she cheated on me with or the older guy who gives her money for kissing him. She said, “I deleted and blocked their numbers.” 

I asked her why she’d do that when it doesn't matter anymore, and she said she didn’t care about them enough to keep them in her life. That pissed me off so much. I told her, “You cared enough to jeopardize our entire relationship. You didn’t even think about the hard time I was going through, and how your actions were like nails in the coffin. You cared enough to let them answer my calls on your phone. When you came back, you said he was just your friend, but when he called you drunk, you flipped out like you cared for him. You even wrote in your journal after you went out with him, fantasizing about him, and the guy isn’t even good-looking. (I'm not trying to be petty, but it would’ve been easier for me if he was good-looking because now it feels like anyone could have had you.) And when you came back, you said you couldn’t stop thinking about him because he was falling in love with you. Bitch, what about me? Every damn day, I got drunk and high, then cried myself to sleep. You abandoned me, knowing full well I don’t have anyone in this country, while you have your whole family, who still didn’t care enough to support you when you ended up in the psych ward.”

I yelled, “I never abandoned you!” then she started accusing me of cheating and saying I’m not a saint, or that I used her for her body because she was convenient. Like, what the hell? She literally took no accountability and said I abused her. Then I showed her pictures of all the times she made me bleed or burned my face with a cigarette. She gave a fake apology, acting like she didn’t even know she’d done those things.

By the end of it, she acted like I was the problem for bringing up all her awful actions. If you don’t want someone to bring up your terrible behavior, then don’t do those things in the first place and act like everything is normal afterward. Now I feel like this is why all her friendships fall apart, or maybe other people weren’t as bad as she makes them out to be. I think the reason her parents view her as an eyesore is because she’s probably hurt them so many times that they can’t look past her actions, even when she tries to be good.

1fwr5p8,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1fwr5p8/im_deeply_in_love_with_my_best_friend_but_she_has/,"I’m deeply in love with my best friend, but she has a boyfriend.","I (19F) have been in love with my best friend (19F) for as long as I can remember. I met her when we were in 6th grade, and we became pretty close the following year. We briefly dated for a period of time in 7th grade, but she broke things off and went back to her ex-girlfriend. We stayed as friends, she moved schools before 8th grade, and I didn't see her much. We continued to keep in contact through text, and despite not seeing each other that entire year, grew closer. We started talking over the phone about moving in together after high school, how we would decorate our future apartment, and were planning a life together. I want to go as far as saying I recall us talking about getting married at one point during that time... and being serious about it.

Freshman year rolls around, and we kind of lose contact for a minute. I go through a toxic relationship to the point the point where I basically was forced to cut her off - she's having relationships of her own and making new friends. We pick up a little bit again sophomore and junior year. One night I go to her place and we're jacking around at her mom's house, and I can't remember who suggested the idea, but we kissed that night. She tends to joke about it now that she wanted to then because she was pissed at her own toxic boyfriend at the time.
 
Senior year comes to an end. We haven't seen each other much in the past few years, but we are still in contact. We finally get to meet up and come to find out she's living at her current boyfriend's parents' house now. We started hanging out often last summer. I vividly remember laying down in a hammock in the backyard and us having such a good time talking and her boyfriend coming up to us and flipping the hammock over to screw with us. I hadn't known him long at this point, and it honestly pissed me off that he interrupted us like that and laughed about it. 

December comes. Our birthdays are 3 days apart, and for whatever reason I wanted to give her something small for her birthday. So I bought these specific chocolates she really likes and gave them to her. I came and spent her birthday with her; she came over for my birthday too and gave me one of my favorite CDs, and I thought it was really sweet, and she definitely put thought into it. We never really celebrated our birthdays together until this past December. I came and visited her on Christmas too. Her boyfriend even gave me a gift card to a coffee shop I like. I came to realize he's not such a bad guy after all. He's actually a good kid - certainly the best she's had yet.
Sure, he ignores her from time to time, but he's smart, decent looking, and clearly cares about her. 
 
We are always hanging out at her place. We talk for hours about anything and everything. We reminisce on memories. I'm spending the night there often. Sleeping in the same bed with her. Inches away from her. We even cuddled together once or twice. The energy is always there when we're together. We hung out together last week. Went to dinner, drove around, went to a park, and stared at the stars. It felt so intimate that night, talking to each other in silence at the bottom of the slides, staring into space. Sitting so close to me. She turns over to me at one point and just tells me how she thinks I'm really pretty, and we're speaking so softly, and I just have that feeling she wanted to kiss me. I don't know.
But she has work the next morning, so she drops me off. Kind of left me wondering that night. We also went and saw Chappell Roan Thursday night and had the time of our lives. She was being super touchy the entire night, standing close behind me, holding my hand, always close to me all night.
 
I just don't know what to do with my feelings anymore. There's so many more small details I could get into on here. Like how the night we saw Chappell, while we were getting ready, she comes into the room and asks randomly, ""Do you ever wonder how things would be if we never broke up?"" I feel like I'm going crazy because I have this gut feeling she also still has feelings for me, but how do I even go about that? It's already so hard containing my jealousy when her boyfriend is around. I sometimes wonder if she just enjoys the stability she gets around him since she never got that growing up. His entire family treats her like she's their own. They don't even know that they're together a year and a half later.

I wish I was able to give her that. I wish I could give her even more. I would seriously do anything for her, and she means the world to me. I've written her so many notes I'll likely never give her, cried about her more times than I could count, and would drop everything to come see her if she needed something. I'm sobbing as I write this. I don't think I ever even knew what love was until I knew her. I'm seeing her in a couple hours, should I say something or just keep pretending I’m not deeply in love with her? Am I possibly just overthinking things too much? How do I discuss my feelings without pushing her away or losing our friendship?

I Wish I Hadn't,"I arrived in Shanghai under a haze of jet lag and grief. The city’s chaotic energy did little to ease the numbness that had settled in my bones. I hadn’t returned to China since I was a child, and even then, it was a fleeting visit, a brief encounter with distant relatives I never thought I’d see again. Now, I was back to settle an estate that felt more like a burden than a gift.

The death of my uncle, a man I barely knew, had summoned me here. I had only vague memories of him from my childhood, blurry images of a quiet man standing at the edge of family gatherings. When I was contacted by the lawyer handling his estate, the news didn’t hit me with the shock one might expect. Instead, it felt like a summons, an obligation to a man whose life had been a mystery to me. Still, I accepted out of duty more than curiosity, and now found myself in the heart of a city that thrived on life, while I felt nothing but the weight of death.

After dealing with the legal formalities, I wandered through the neon-lit streets, the skyscrapers towering above me, casting long shadows that seemed to reach out like fingers in the night. The lawyer had been distant, dismissive even, handing me the keys to the old family property with little more than a formal nod. ""It's all in your hands now,"" he had said, and the words echoed in my mind, heavy with implication. What did he mean by that?

I found myself by the river, watching the lights from the Bund reflect on the water. The city hummed with life around me, but it felt as though I was drifting, disconnected, a stranger in my own family’s history. That’s when I saw him.

He stood casually by the railing, his silhouette illuminated by the glow of the skyline. There was something about him that caught my attention immediately. Perhaps it was the way he stood, confident yet reserved, or the way his eyes flickered toward me before I had even realized I was staring. He didn’t belong to the crowd; that much was clear. He seemed... separate, like a fragment of the night itself.

""Beautiful night, isn't it?""

His voice was smooth, almost melodic, breaking through the ambient noise of the city. There was a warmth in his tone that made the hairs on the back of my neck rise, an unsettling, magnetic pull.

I hesitated for a moment before responding. ""It is,"" I said softly, unsure why I was suddenly nervous. His gaze was intense, almost too intense, but there was an undeniable charm in his smile. I found myself drawn to him, feeling a spark of something I hadn’t felt since I’d arrived, a connection in a place that had so far made me feel utterly alone.

""Lei.. he introduced himself, holding out a hand. His grip was firm but cold, a subtle chill that lingered even after he released it.

We fell into an easy conversation as we walked along the riverside, the lights of the city shimmering on the surface of the water beside us. Lei was charismatic, attentive in a way that made me forget, if only for a moment, why I was even in Shanghai. He asked about me, about my life, but deflected when I asked about his. Mysterious, I thought. Maybe a little too mysterious, but I was intrigued. After all, what harm was there in a little distraction from the heaviness of death?

By the time we parted ways, exchanging numbers, I felt a strange sense of relief. For the first time since I’d arrived, I wasn’t alone. But as I made my way back to the sleek, modern apartment I was renting, I couldn’t shake the feeling that Lei had been watching me long before I had noticed him.

The following days passed in a blur of paperwork and phone calls. The estate had more complications than I expected, deeds, assets, and family relics I had never heard of. Each conversation with the lawyer brought new surprises, like my uncle’s ownership of an old house tucked away in one of Shanghai’s forgotten districts. The thought of going there alone made me uneasy, so I kept putting it off. Something about the way the lawyer had brushed off questions about the house felt wrong, as though he didn’t want to talk about it.

But in between the stress, there was Lei.

We had been seeing each other almost every day. Dinners, late-night walks, and quiet conversations in quiet cafes. It was easy to get lost in his charm, his ease of conversation, the way he seemed to understand everything without me having to explain. Still, I couldn’t help but feel there was something he wasn’t telling me, something just beneath the surface. He would smile, but sometimes the smile didn’t quite reach his eyes.

One night, after a particularly grueling day dealing with the estate, Lei invited me to his apartment. The invitation felt natural, a progression in what had quickly become a relationship .

His apartment was on the outskirts of the city, in a high-rise that seemed out of place among the old neighborhoods it towered over. The interior was modern, sleek, and spotless. Yet it felt sterile. There were no personal touches, no photos or signs of a life lived. Just perfect, polished surfaces.

“You must be exhausted,” Lei said, as he poured me a glass of wine. I nodded, trying to shake off the unease creeping up my spine. The warmth of the wine helped a little, but the coldness of the apartment clung to me.

As we sat together on his pristine couch, I couldn’t help but notice how still he was. Too still. His movements, usually smooth and graceful, now seemed rehearsed, like each gesture was part of an intricate performance. And then, for the briefest moment, I saw it.

A crack.

It was small, barely noticeable, but it ran along the edge of his jawline. At first, I thought it was a trick of the light, but when I blinked, it was gone, as if it had never been there. My breath hitched in my throat. I wanted to ask him, to say something, but the words died before they left my lips. I stared at my wine glass instead, forcing myself to relax, to ignore what I had just seen.

“Is something wrong?” Lei’s voice cut through my thoughts, soft but probing.

I shook my head quickly, plastering on a smile. “No, I’m just... tired.”

He watched me for a moment, his dark eyes unreadable, before nodding. “Of course. It’s been a long week for you.”

His hand touched mine, cold against my skin, and for a second, I could swear I felt that same crack beneath his fingers. A chill raced through me, but I said nothing.

The days that followed should have felt normal, but nothing did. My work with the estate became an afterthought, replaced by an obsession I couldn’t shake: Lei. Something about him gnawed at my mind, filling every quiet moment with unease. I kept replaying that night in his apartment, convincing myself that the crack I’d seen was just a trick of my exhausted mind.

But the more I tried to rationalize it, the worse the feeling became. It wasn’t just that. He was changing, or at least, my perception of him was. Small things, barely noticeable at first. His voice would sometimes sound too smooth, almost unnatural. His movements, always so graceful, seemed too deliberate, like they were mimicked rather than natural.

And the dreams... They started shortly after that night in his apartment.

In the first dream, I was standing at the foot of Lei’s bed. He was lying there, asleep, but something was wrong. His face was smooth and flawless as always, but then, slowly, the skin began to peel away. It didn’t bleed, and there was no pain, just layers of flesh slipping off, revealing something hideous underneath. A twisted, contorted face with hollow eyes that stared back at me. I tried to scream, but no sound came.

I woke in a cold sweat, my heart pounding, the sheets tangled around me. It was just a dream, I told myself, over and over again.

The next few days passed in a blur of paranoia. Every time I met with Lei, I couldn’t shake the feeling that he was watching me too closely, studying me. And the crack I’d seen that night? It started appearing more often. Sometimes it was on his jaw, sometimes his hands. Each time it would disappear before I could get a second look, but I knew it wasn’t just my imagination.

One afternoon, I decided it was finally time to visit my uncle’s old house. The place had been left untouched for years, gathering dust and sinking into disrepair. The lawyer’s vague descriptions and dismissiveness had only fueled my curiosity. I had been avoiding it, reluctant to confront whatever history might be buried there, but the weight of uncertainty was starting to suffocate me.

The house stood at the end of a narrow street, hidden among overgrown trees and faded stone walls. It was a stark contrast to the sleek, modern apartment I had been staying in. Everything about this place felt old, forgotten, like it belonged to a different era altogether. I pushed open the creaking door, a rush of stale air hitting me as I stepped inside.

I spent hours going through piles of papers, yellowed books, and fading family mementos. My uncle’s life was scattered across the rooms, half-forgotten, and for a while, it felt like I was drowning in someone else’s memories. The deeper I dug, the more disoriented I became. Dusty photographs, letters written in fading ink, items that seemed to have no connection to me at all.

At the bottom of a worn leather box, buried beneath stacks of old papers, was an old photograph. The paper was fragile, worn around the edges, but it was the faces in the picture that sent a chill through me. I stared at the image, two men standing side by side. One of them I recognized immediately as my great-uncle, though he was much younger in the picture. But it was the man beside him that made my skin crawl.

It was Lei...

The photograph had to be at least 60 years old, judging by the way the men were dressed. Yet Lei looked exactly the same as he did now. His face was unchanged, smooth, flawless, and unaged. The realization hit me like a blow to the chest, my hands trembling as I held the picture closer to examine it. No one could look the same after all this time.

I flipped the photograph over, hoping for some explanation, but the back was blank. No dates, no names, nothing that could tell me who these men were to each other or why this picture existed. A wave of nausea rolled through me. It wasn’t just Lei's unnerving perfection anymore. There was something far darker at play here, something that had been lurking in the shadows of my family long before I arrived in Shanghai.

The air in the room felt thick, suffocating, and I suddenly had the overwhelming urge to leave. I shoved the photograph into my bag and rushed out of the house, not bothering to lock the door behind me.

As I walked back to the apartment, the city’s noise became distant, muffled by the thoughts crashing through my mind. Lei wasn’t human. He couldn’t be. The photograph was proof, proof that he had existed far longer than any normal person should. But why? And why was he here, now, in my life? The questions spun wildly in my head, but no answers came. I felt a growing sense of dread, as if the world around me was closing in.

That night, I lay awake in bed, the photograph resting on the table beside me. I couldn’t stop thinking about it. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw Lei’s face, his perfect, unchanging face, and the crack I had seen on his skin.

The next morning, I woke up feeling heavy, as though the weight of the photograph had settled deep inside my chest, squeezing my lungs. I hadn’t slept well. Every creak in the apartment made me bolt upright, expecting to find Lei standing in the shadows, watching me. The rational part of my brain kept trying to soothe me, to tell me that I was overreacting, but the photograph on the table beside me said otherwise.

I couldn’t just ignore it. I needed answers, but I wasn’t sure how to get them. Who could I even trust at this point?

I decided to meet Lei later that day. I wasn’t ready to confront him, not yet, but I needed to see him. I needed to figure out if there was any part of this man that was still... normal, still human. Maybe I could find a crack in the façade that would explain all of this. Or maybe I was walking straight into a trap.

When he greeted me outside a café, his smile was just as flawless as it always had been. But now, I couldn’t unsee the truth. I couldn’t shake the image of the photograph, the knowledge that he had been standing beside my great-uncle, looking exactly the same as he did now. How long had he been hiding this? And why?

“You seem distant today,” Lei said, his eyes narrowing slightly as we sat down. “Is everything alright?”

I forced a smile, fighting the growing panic in my chest. “Yeah, just... didn’t sleep too well last night.”

He studied me carefully, too carefully, as if he knew I was hiding something. There was something in his gaze that I hadn’t noticed before, something calculating and cold. I could feel my pulse racing, the walls of the café closing in around me.

I needed to leave.

But before I could excuse myself, Lei’s hand reached across the table, resting lightly on mine. His touch, once so warm and reassuring, now felt like ice. “You’ve been different lately,” he said, his voice too smooth, too controlled. “Distracted.”

I swallowed hard, trying to pull my hand away, but his grip tightened.

I yanked my hand free, my heart pounding in my chest. “I... I need to go.”

Lei’s expression didn’t change, but there was something in his eyes that sent a shiver down my spine. He knew. He knew I had seen something, and now there was no going back.

I left the café in a rush, not daring to look back. My hands were trembling as I hurried down the street, my mind racing. I needed to figure out what I was dealing with, but who could help me? The police? No, they’d think I was insane. My friends? They were thousands of miles away, and besides, they wouldn’t understand. No one would.

Except maybe... the lawyer.

The thought hit me like a lightning bolt. He had been so dismissive, so eager to hand off my uncle’s estate and wash his hands of it. But now that I thought about it, there had been something strange about the way he avoided answering my questions about my family’s past. Maybe he knew more than he let on. Maybe he could help me understand what was happening.

I grabbed my phone and dialed his number, my fingers shaking as I pressed it to my ear.

“Hello?” His voice crackled through the line, sharp and impatient.

“It’s me,” I said, trying to keep my voice steady. “I need to talk to you. It’s about my uncle... something really strange is going on.”

There was a pause on the other end, longer than I expected. When he finally spoke, his voice was quieter, more measured. “Meet me at my office. We’ll talk.”

I hung up, a knot of anxiety twisting in my gut. The way he had said it, ""we’ll talk,"" felt loaded with meaning. He knew something. I could feel it.

The lawyer’s office was tucked away in a quiet corner of the city, the kind of place you wouldn’t notice unless you were looking for it. The building was unremarkable, with peeling paint and a small sign that looked like it hadn’t been changed in years. I wasn’t sure why I had come here, but my instincts told me this was my only lead. If anyone could give me answers about my uncle’s strange past, it would be Mr. Feng.

I stepped inside, the musty smell of old paper and dust greeting me. He sat behind his desk, his sharp eyes flicking up from a stack of documents as I entered.

“I thought you were done with the estate,” he muttered, setting his papers aside.

I shook my head, suddenly unsure how to begin. “It’s not about the estate. I’ve... I’ve found something. Something strange.”

He leaned back in his chair, his expression shifting from mild annoyance to curiosity. “Go on.”

I hesitated, pulling the photograph from my bag and sliding it across the desk. He glanced at it, his brow furrowing as he examined the faded image of my great-uncle and Lei standing together, decades ago.

“This photo. It’s old,” I said, my voice barely above a whisper. “But the man in it... He hasn’t aged. That’s Lei. The same man I’ve been seeing for the past few weeks. He looks exactly the same.”

Mr. Feng’s face paled as his fingers tightened around the photograph. He stared at it for a long moment, then placed it carefully on the desk, his hands trembling slightly.

“Where did you find this?” he asked, his voice quieter now, tinged with something I couldn’t quite place. Fear, maybe.

“In my uncle’s house,” I replied. “I was going through his things and... I don’t know. I can’t explain it. But something about Lei. There’s something wrong with him.”

He sighed heavily, rubbing a hand over his face. He seemed older now, more worn down than when I had first met him. “I had hoped this wouldn’t happen,” he muttered to himself. Then, louder: “Your uncle was involved in something. Something he didn’t want to talk about.”

I leaned forward. “What do you mean? What was he involved in?”

He stood up, pacing behind his desk. “Your family has been in Shanghai for generations. There are old stories, legends about strange things happening to people connected to your bloodline. Disappearances, sightings, people aging too quickly or not at all. I thought it was just nonsense, superstitions passed down through the years. But when I saw your uncle’s estate and how quickly he wanted it all handled, I suspected something else.”

He paused, glancing at the photograph again. “But this... this is proof.”

My mouth went dry. “Proof of what?”

“Proof that whatever your uncle was trying to escape has come back. And now it’s after you.”

The words hung in the air, heavy and suffocating. I shook my head, trying to process what he was saying. “Lei isn’t... he’s not human, is he?”

Mr. Feng didn’t answer right away. He seemed to struggle with the words, finally saying, “There’s an old legend, one that speaks of creatures that can take the form of humans. They use their appearance to deceive, to lure people in. These creatures, these painted skin demons, have been around for centuries, feeding on those they can trap.”

I felt a wave of nausea wash over me, my vision blurring as the reality of what he was saying set in. “And you think... you think Lei is one of them?”

He nodded grimly. “I’m almost certain. Your uncle tried to run from this, but he wasn’t fast enough. You need to leave Shanghai. Now.”

I stood up, my legs shaky. “But how... how do I stop him? How do I get away?”

He looked at me with pity in his eyes. “I don’t know if you can. But you need to try.”

I left Mr. Feng’s office with a cold knot of fear in my stomach. The streets outside were busy as always, but everything felt distant, muffled, like I was moving through a dream I couldn’t wake up from. The world around me no longer felt real. Nothing did.

My mind raced as I hurried back to my apartment. Mr. Feng’s words echoed in my head, each one tightening the noose of dread around my chest. Painted skin demon. The idea sounded ridiculous, something pulled straight out of a horror movie. But the photograph, Lei... I couldn’t ignore the truth anymore. I had seen it with my own eyes. I had felt it in my gut. Lei wasn’t human, and now I was part of whatever dark game he was playing.

I fumbled with the keys to my apartment, my hands shaking as I let myself inside. The door slammed shut behind me, and I locked it quickly, as if the flimsy bolt could keep something like him out. The apartment was quiet, too quiet. I moved to the window, pulling the curtains shut, trying to block out the city beyond. For the first time since I’d arrived in Shanghai, I felt trapped, cornered by something I didn’t understand.

I needed to leave. Mr. Feng was right; there was no point in trying to confront Lei. I had to get as far away from him as possible. My flight back to the United States wasn’t scheduled for another week, but I couldn’t wait that long. I had to find a way out now.

I packed quickly, throwing my belongings into my suitcase with shaking hands. As I zipped up the bag, my phone buzzed on the table. The screen lit up with a message from Lei.

“Dinner tonight? I miss you.”

My heart lurched in my chest. The words were innocent, casual even, but now they sent a jolt of terror through me. He knew. He had to know. Why else would he reach out now, after everything? I stared at the message, my hands cold and clammy, before forcing myself to respond.

“I’m not feeling well. Maybe another time.”

I set the phone down and took a deep breath, trying to calm the frantic rhythm of my heartbeat. I didn’t have much time. I needed to book a flight, get out of the apartment, and disappear before Lei realized what I was doing.

I was about to start searching for flights when the phone buzzed again. Another message.

“I can come over. Take care of you.”

I dropped the phone, my pulse spiking. He was too close, too eager. I had to move. Now.

I grabbed my suitcase and darted toward the door. Just as I reached for the handle, there was a knock. Three sharp raps echoed through the apartment like a death knell.

“Hey! it’s me.”

Lei’s voice...

I stumbled back from the door, my mind spinning. How had he gotten here so fast? I hadn’t even told him where I lived, had I? Panic surged through me as the knocking came again, louder this time.

“Are you in there?” Lei’s voice was smooth, calm, but there was an edge to it now, something that made my skin crawl. “You didn’t answer my message.”

I clutched my suitcase, my back pressed against the far wall of the apartment. I could hear him moving outside the door, his footsteps slow, deliberate, like he was waiting for something.

“I know you’re in there,” he said softly, almost playfully now. “Don’t you want to see me?”

I didn’t respond. I couldn’t. Every instinct in my body was screaming for me to stay silent, to keep as far away from the door as possible. But I knew I couldn’t stay here. I had to get out. My eyes darted around the apartment, searching for an escape.

The fire escape. My window led to the back of the building, where the fire escape ladder could take me down to the alley below. It wasn’t much of a plan, but it was the only chance I had. I moved as quietly as I could, tiptoeing toward the window. I slid it open slowly, wincing at the faint creak of the hinges.

Just as I was about to climb out, my phone buzzed again. Another message.

“Where do you think you’re going?”

My stomach twisted. I looked down at the phone in horror. There was no way he could have known. Unless he could see me.

I didn’t have time to think. I clambered out the window, gripping the cold metal of the fire escape as I hurried down the ladder, my breath coming in ragged gasps. The alley was dark and narrow, the shadows thick between the buildings. I hit the ground running, my suitcase dragging behind me as I raced toward the street. I didn’t know where I was going; all I knew was that I needed to get away.

The city felt like a maze, the streets twisting and turning, leading me nowhere. My mind was racing, a jumble of fear and panic that blurred the world around me. I had no plan, no clear destination. I just kept running, hoping that the distance would be enough to keep him away.

But it wasn’t long before I realized that something was wrong.

No matter how far I ran, no matter how many streets I crossed, I couldn’t shake the feeling that Lei was still close. Too close. Every time I glanced over my shoulder, I thought I saw him, just a flicker of movement in the crowd, a face too familiar among the strangers passing by.

I ducked into a nearby café, my chest heaving as I tried to catch my breath. I couldn’t keep running like this. I needed to get out of Shanghai, and fast. I couldn’t just sit here, waiting for him to find me. I grabbed my phone and started scrolling through flights. There was a late-night flight leaving for the United States in a few hours. It was expensive, but I didn’t care. I booked it without thinking, my hands trembling as I entered my payment details.

For a moment, I allowed myself to exhale, feeling the tension in my body loosen just a little. The café was quiet, a small bubble of normalcy amid the chaos that had consumed my life. The low hum of conversations and the clinking of coffee cups gave me a false sense of comfort. I looked around. No sign of Lei. He wasn’t here. Not now.

I slid further into the booth, my legs trembling beneath the table. The adrenaline that had been keeping me on my feet for hours was starting to wear off, replaced by a deep, bone-weary exhaustion. I had barely slept in days, and now that I was sitting still, the weight of everything was crashing down on me. My body was screaming for rest, but my mind wouldn’t stop racing. Every nerve in my body told me to stay alert, to keep moving, but I couldn’t anymore. Just for a moment, I told myself. Just a moment to close my eyes and breathe. I must have only intended to rest for a minute or two, but exhaustion claimed me completely.

I don’t know how long I had been asleep, maybe an hour, maybe less, but when I woke, the café felt different. The air was thick, stifling, and there was a strange silence that hung heavy in the room.

I was still winking the sleep away when suddenly , the screen lit up with a new message.

“You can’t hide from me.”

A cold wave of terror crashed over me, snapping me out of my drowsy haze. I had fallen asleep. I had let my guard down, and now... now he was here. Or close. I shoved my phone into my bag and bolted for the door .

I burst onto the street, my pulse racing as I frantically scanned the crowd for any sign of Lei. Every shadow, every figure felt like a threat, like he was lurking just out of view. I couldn't see him, but I knew he was there. Watching. Waiting.

I waved down the first taxi I saw, nearly tripping over myself as I climbed into the backseat. The driver barely glanced at me as I gave him the address for the airport, my voice shaky and strained. He pulled away from the curb, the hum of the engine a faint comfort as the city began to blur past the windows.

I gripped the edge of the seat, trying to steady my breathing. The flight was booked, and I had a few hours left to make it to the airport. All I had to do was get on that plane. Once I was in the air, once I left Shanghai, I’d be free. At least, that’s what I told myself.

But the uneasy feeling that had settled in the pit of my stomach refused to fade. Lei had found me so easily before. How had he known I was in the café? How had he always been one step ahead?

The taxi began slowing down.

I glanced up and I saw a pair of red taillights ahead, blinking in the dark. There was a construction vehicle blocking the road, a detour sign flashing in the dim light. The driver sighed, pulling the car to a stop.

“Looks like we’ll have to take a different route,” he muttered, glancing at me in the rearview mirror.

I nodded, but something felt... off. The street was too quiet, the shadows too thick. I couldn’t shake the feeling that Lei was still close, no matter how fast I tried to escape.

Suddenly, a loud bang shattered the silence.

I gasped as the passenger window exploded inward, glass raining down like shards of ice. My heart seized in my chest as I turned to see him: Lei. His hand gripping the edge of the broken window, his dark eyes locking onto mine. He moved too fast, too silent, like a predator that had been lurking in the shadows all along.

His hand lunged through the window, reaching for me with terrifying speed. His fingers grazed my arm, cold and unyielding. I jerked back, my heart hammering in my throat, but his grip was like iron, tightening around my wrist. He pulled harder, his strength inhuman, dragging me toward the shattered window, shards of glass cutting into my skin.

""You’re not leaving,"" he growled, his voice low and menacing, sending a chill down my spine. ""You’ll never leave me.""

The driver let out a panicked shout, and the car lurched forward with a screech of tires. The sudden momentum ripped Lei's grip from my wrist and sent him crashing to the ground with brutal force.

The driver swore loudly, the air thick with panic.

I dared a glance over my shoulder, terrified of what I might see.

In the middle of the road, Lei rose slowly to his feet, his movements unnaturally fluid. His head tilted slightly, his eyes locked on the taxi, and a twisted smile crept across his face.

""GO! PLEASE!"" I screamed, my voice cracking as I whipped back toward the driver.

The driver, pale and wide-eyed, nodded frantically, slamming his foot down on the gas pedal.

The moment the taxi pulled up to the airport, a wave of relief washed over me. I was almost there, just a few steps away from leaving Shanghai, from leaving Lei behind. The terminal was busy, packed with travelers hurrying to their gates, dragging luggage and speaking in rapid-fire conversations that blurred together. It was all so normal, so ordinary, that for the first time in days, I felt a flicker of hope.

I just had to make it through.

Dragging my suitcase behind me, I made my way through the throngs of people. I glanced at the departures board, my eyes darting to the flight that would take me back to Houston.

I made my way directly to the boarding gate, and just nearby, I spotted a restroom. Needing a moment to collect myself, I headed into the women’s restroom, eager for a brief escape before boarding. The room was silent and empty, the cold fluorescent lights flickering overhead. Setting my bag down, I splashed cold water on my face, hoping to wash away the fear that clung to me like a shadow.

For a moment, I closed my eyes and breathed deeply. Just a few more minutes. I’ll be in the air, away from all of this.

But when I opened my eyes, everything changed.

Standing behind me in the mirror.. Lei’s reflection filled the space just inches away. His eyes.. those cold..dark eyes, burned with something far more sinister than before. My heart seized in my chest as I spun around, but before I could scream, he lunged at me, his hand wrapping around my throat.

My breath hitched as his cold fingers closed tightly, squeezing the air from my lungs.

Before I could fight back, he lifted me off the ground as if I weighed nothing, his hand tightening around my neck. My feet dangled uselessly in the air, kicking wildly as panic flooded through me. The cold, tiled floor below seemed to stretch away, the world blurring around the edges of my vision...

I clawed at his hand, my nails digging into his skin, but it didn’t matter. His grip didn’t loosen. He held me effortlessly, his dark eyes watching me with that same eerie calm, as if this were all part of some twisted game.

My chest burned, desperate for air. I gasped, but nothing came. My pulse pounded in my ears, and black spots danced at the corners of my vision. The pressure on my throat was unbearable. Every second, it grew tighter, crushing me from the inside out.

He leaned in closer, his voice a low, mocking whisper. “You really thought you could get away from me?”

My mind raced, desperate for a way out, for anything that could save me. But the bathroom was empty, and his grip was relentless.

Then, the door swung open.

A security guard stepped inside, his expression turning to confusion as he saw Lei in the women’s restroom. “Hey!” he called out, stepping forward.

LET GO OF HER!”

Lei didn’t even flinch. His grip loosened on my neck for just a second, but it was enough for me to gasp for air, my body shaking with terror. The guard reached for Lei, trying to pull him away from me, but Lei moved too quickly. He turned on the guard, shoving him backward with a force that sent him crashing to the floor.

They struggled, the guard trying to fight back, but Lei was too strong, too fast. Lei grabbed the guard by the collar and slammed him against the wall with a brutal strength I hadn’t fully understood until now.

But in that moment, I saw my chance.

Without thinking, I ran toward the door, my legs trembling beneath me. I pushed it open and stumbled out into the busy terminal, gasping for air as I ran toward the gate.

The terminal was crowded, a sea of people rushing toward their gates. I ducked into the flow of bodies, weaving through the mass of travelers. I could still hear the sounds of the struggle behind me, but I didn’t dare look back. I had to reach the gate. I had to get on that plane.

I could feel Lei’s presence behind me, even if he wasn’t there. His voice still echoed in my mind, his hands still wrapped around my throat.

When I reached the gate, it was already boarding. The crowd of passengers offered me the cover I needed. I merged into the line, keeping my head down, my hands shaking as I handed my ticket to the agent. She smiled and waved me through, unaware of the terror that had been stalking me for days.

I stepped onto the plane, the cool, pressurized air hitting me like a wave. Rows of seats stretched out in front of me, passengers already settled, tucking bags into overhead compartments and chatting quietly. I moved through the aisle like a ghost, my mind still racing, scanning every face for any sign of Lei. But he wasn’t here. Not anymore.

I found my seat near the back of the plane, squeezing past a woman engrossed in her book, her headphones firmly in place. I sank into the window seat, my hands shaking as I buckled the seatbelt. The hum of the engines below was a faint comfort, something steady in the chaos.

The pit in my stomach tightened as the plane gathered speed, racing faster and faster down the runway. My fingers gripped the armrests, the tension rising with every passing second. I stared out the window, watching as the ground blurred beneath us, the airport shrinking away as the nose of the plane lifted into the sky.

I had escaped.

Or so I thought.

As I sat there, staring out the window, I felt a strange tingling in my hand. I looked down, and my blood froze. There, on the inside of my palm, was a mark, faint, barely visible, but undeniably there. A thin crack, like the ones I had seen on Lei’s skin, ran across the surface of my hand. It was as if a part of him had stayed with me, even now, even after I had escaped.

I clenched my fist, trying to ignore the chill creeping up my spine. I had made it onto the plane. I was leaving Shanghai. But I knew, deep down, that I hadn’t truly escaped him.

I could still feel his presence. [Watching](https://www.youtube.com/@herscreams). Waiting.",1,1728136713.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

What would you do? ,"So I had a friend A (who works with me) for 1 year who hung out with me often. Then she became unfair and always bailed on me last minute. On my birthday party that I had been planning for months, she texted me at 11pm to say she had napped and wasn’t coming but was going to our mutual friends house tomorrow so I would see her there? 
No apology. She also texted me twice for lunch and I set up the lunch meeting and then she just cancelled on the day and said she’s sick and one day I went there and she didn’t even come, but her boyfriend told me. Another friend, friend B, from work and I, who used to be very close, don’t talk anymore. Friend A’s boyfriend loves to gossip and tried to find out why myself and friend B are not friends so that he could tell friend B back everything I would say.

I am obviously now annoyed with friend B and friend B’s boyfriend. They are getting engaged and after 7 MONTHS of me and friend B not seeing each other, she sends a text like “to my favourite girl! I’m inviting you to my wedding and to my engagement party hope you can make both!””

For the wedding, it is a 9 hour flight away so I am not going. The engagement- she said it’s end of November “ISH “ and didn’t specify a date. I can either say 

1.) yes I’m coming to the engagement and then just pretend to be sick one day before or whatever (like she has done to me 4-5 times now) 

2.) hey no I’m not coming as my family are visiting at this time (this is true) so I will be busy and I am also now not a party person anymore. However would love to have coffee/ lunch/ evening meal together one day? 


I know that friend B is not a life long friend and partly only wonder if I’m invited to make an extra number for the party or so her boyfriend can get gossip out of me. What should I say? ",1,1728136691.0,DecidingToBeBetter,3,1.0,False

I Wish I Hadn't,"I arrived in Shanghai under a haze of jet lag and grief. The city’s chaotic energy did little to ease the numbness that had settled in my bones. I hadn’t returned to China since I was a child, and even then, it was a fleeting visit, a brief encounter with distant relatives I never thought I’d see again. Now, I was back to settle an estate that felt more like a burden than a gift.

The death of my uncle, a man I barely knew, had summoned me here. I had only vague memories of him from my childhood, blurry images of a quiet man standing at the edge of family gatherings. When I was contacted by the lawyer handling his estate, the news didn’t hit me with the shock one might expect. Instead, it felt like a summons, an obligation to a man whose life had been a mystery to me. Still, I accepted out of duty more than curiosity, and now found myself in the heart of a city that thrived on life, while I felt nothing but the weight of death.

After dealing with the legal formalities, I wandered through the neon-lit streets, the skyscrapers towering above me, casting long shadows that seemed to reach out like fingers in the night. The lawyer had been distant, dismissive even, handing me the keys to the old family property with little more than a formal nod. ""It's all in your hands now,"" he had said, and the words echoed in my mind, heavy with implication. What did he mean by that?

I found myself by the river, watching the lights from the Bund reflect on the water. The city hummed with life around me, but it felt as though I was drifting, disconnected, a stranger in my own family’s history. That’s when I saw him.

He stood casually by the railing, his silhouette illuminated by the glow of the skyline. There was something about him that caught my attention immediately. Perhaps it was the way he stood, confident yet reserved, or the way his eyes flickered toward me before I had even realized I was staring. He didn’t belong to the crowd; that much was clear. He seemed... separate, like a fragment of the night itself.

""Beautiful night, isn't it?""

His voice was smooth, almost melodic, breaking through the ambient noise of the city. There was a warmth in his tone that made the hairs on the back of my neck rise, an unsettling, magnetic pull.

I hesitated for a moment before responding. ""It is,"" I said softly, unsure why I was suddenly nervous. His gaze was intense, almost too intense, but there was an undeniable charm in his smile. I found myself drawn to him, feeling a spark of something I hadn’t felt since I’d arrived, a connection in a place that had so far made me feel utterly alone.

""Lei.. he introduced himself, holding out a hand. His grip was firm but cold, a subtle chill that lingered even after he released it.

We fell into an easy conversation as we walked along the riverside, the lights of the city shimmering on the surface of the water beside us. Lei was charismatic, attentive in a way that made me forget, if only for a moment, why I was even in Shanghai. He asked about me, about my life, but deflected when I asked about his. Mysterious, I thought. Maybe a little too mysterious, but I was intrigued. After all, what harm was there in a little distraction from the heaviness of death?

By the time we parted ways, exchanging numbers, I felt a strange sense of relief. For the first time since I’d arrived, I wasn’t alone. But as I made my way back to the sleek, modern apartment I was renting, I couldn’t shake the feeling that Lei had been watching me long before I had noticed him.

The following days passed in a blur of paperwork and phone calls. The estate had more complications than I expected, deeds, assets, and family relics I had never heard of. Each conversation with the lawyer brought new surprises, like my uncle’s ownership of an old house tucked away in one of Shanghai’s forgotten districts. The thought of going there alone made me uneasy, so I kept putting it off. Something about the way the lawyer had brushed off questions about the house felt wrong, as though he didn’t want to talk about it.

But in between the stress, there was Lei.

We had been seeing each other almost every day. Dinners, late-night walks, and quiet conversations in quiet cafes. It was easy to get lost in his charm, his ease of conversation, the way he seemed to understand everything without me having to explain. Still, I couldn’t help but feel there was something he wasn’t telling me, something just beneath the surface. He would smile, but sometimes the smile didn’t quite reach his eyes.

One night, after a particularly grueling day dealing with the estate, Lei invited me to his apartment. The invitation felt natural, a progression in what had quickly become a relationship .

His apartment was on the outskirts of the city, in a high-rise that seemed out of place among the old neighborhoods it towered over. The interior was modern, sleek, and spotless. Yet it felt sterile. There were no personal touches, no photos or signs of a life lived. Just perfect, polished surfaces.

“You must be exhausted,” Lei said, as he poured me a glass of wine. I nodded, trying to shake off the unease creeping up my spine. The warmth of the wine helped a little, but the coldness of the apartment clung to me.

As we sat together on his pristine couch, I couldn’t help but notice how still he was. Too still. His movements, usually smooth and graceful, now seemed rehearsed, like each gesture was part of an intricate performance. And then, for the briefest moment, I saw it.

A crack.

It was small, barely noticeable, but it ran along the edge of his jawline. At first, I thought it was a trick of the light, but when I blinked, it was gone, as if it had never been there. My breath hitched in my throat. I wanted to ask him, to say something, but the words died before they left my lips. I stared at my wine glass instead, forcing myself to relax, to ignore what I had just seen.

“Is something wrong?” Lei’s voice cut through my thoughts, soft but probing.

I shook my head quickly, plastering on a smile. “No, I’m just... tired.”

He watched me for a moment, his dark eyes unreadable, before nodding. “Of course. It’s been a long week for you.”

His hand touched mine, cold against my skin, and for a second, I could swear I felt that same crack beneath his fingers. A chill raced through me, but I said nothing.

The days that followed should have felt normal, but nothing did. My work with the estate became an afterthought, replaced by an obsession I couldn’t shake: Lei. Something about him gnawed at my mind, filling every quiet moment with unease. I kept replaying that night in his apartment, convincing myself that the crack I’d seen was just a trick of my exhausted mind.

But the more I tried to rationalize it, the worse the feeling became. It wasn’t just that. He was changing, or at least, my perception of him was. Small things, barely noticeable at first. His voice would sometimes sound too smooth, almost unnatural. His movements, always so graceful, seemed too deliberate, like they were mimicked rather than natural.

And the dreams... They started shortly after that night in his apartment.

In the first dream, I was standing at the foot of Lei’s bed. He was lying there, asleep, but something was wrong. His face was smooth and flawless as always, but then, slowly, the skin began to peel away. It didn’t bleed, and there was no pain, just layers of flesh slipping off, revealing something hideous underneath. A twisted, contorted face with hollow eyes that stared back at me. I tried to scream, but no sound came.

I woke in a cold sweat, my heart pounding, the sheets tangled around me. It was just a dream, I told myself, over and over again.

The next few days passed in a blur of paranoia. Every time I met with Lei, I couldn’t shake the feeling that he was watching me too closely, studying me. And the crack I’d seen that night? It started appearing more often. Sometimes it was on his jaw, sometimes his hands. Each time it would disappear before I could get a second look, but I knew it wasn’t just my imagination.

One afternoon, I decided it was finally time to visit my uncle’s old house. The place had been left untouched for years, gathering dust and sinking into disrepair. The lawyer’s vague descriptions and dismissiveness had only fueled my curiosity. I had been avoiding it, reluctant to confront whatever history might be buried there, but the weight of uncertainty was starting to suffocate me.

The house stood at the end of a narrow street, hidden among overgrown trees and faded stone walls. It was a stark contrast to the sleek, modern apartment I had been staying in. Everything about this place felt old, forgotten, like it belonged to a different era altogether. I pushed open the creaking door, a rush of stale air hitting me as I stepped inside.

I spent hours going through piles of papers, yellowed books, and fading family mementos. My uncle’s life was scattered across the rooms, half-forgotten, and for a while, it felt like I was drowning in someone else’s memories. The deeper I dug, the more disoriented I became. Dusty photographs, letters written in fading ink, items that seemed to have no connection to me at all.

At the bottom of a worn leather box, buried beneath stacks of old papers, was an old photograph. The paper was fragile, worn around the edges, but it was the faces in the picture that sent a chill through me. I stared at the image, two men standing side by side. One of them I recognized immediately as my great-uncle, though he was much younger in the picture. But it was the man beside him that made my skin crawl.

It was Lei...

The photograph had to be at least 60 years old, judging by the way the men were dressed. Yet Lei looked exactly the same as he did now. His face was unchanged, smooth, flawless, and unaged. The realization hit me like a blow to the chest, my hands trembling as I held the picture closer to examine it. No one could look the same after all this time.

I flipped the photograph over, hoping for some explanation, but the back was blank. No dates, no names, nothing that could tell me who these men were to each other or why this picture existed. A wave of nausea rolled through me. It wasn’t just Lei's unnerving perfection anymore. There was something far darker at play here, something that had been lurking in the shadows of my family long before I arrived in Shanghai.

The air in the room felt thick, suffocating, and I suddenly had the overwhelming urge to leave. I shoved the photograph into my bag and rushed out of the house, not bothering to lock the door behind me.

As I walked back to the apartment, the city’s noise became distant, muffled by the thoughts crashing through my mind. Lei wasn’t human. He couldn’t be. The photograph was proof, proof that he had existed far longer than any normal person should. But why? And why was he here, now, in my life? The questions spun wildly in my head, but no answers came. I felt a growing sense of dread, as if the world around me was closing in.

That night, I lay awake in bed, the photograph resting on the table beside me. I couldn’t stop thinking about it. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw Lei’s face, his perfect, unchanging face, and the crack I had seen on his skin.

The next morning, I woke up feeling heavy, as though the weight of the photograph had settled deep inside my chest, squeezing my lungs. I hadn’t slept well. Every creak in the apartment made me bolt upright, expecting to find Lei standing in the shadows, watching me. The rational part of my brain kept trying to soothe me, to tell me that I was overreacting, but the photograph on the table beside me said otherwise.

I couldn’t just ignore it. I needed answers, but I wasn’t sure how to get them. Who could I even trust at this point?

I decided to meet Lei later that day. I wasn’t ready to confront him, not yet, but I needed to see him. I needed to figure out if there was any part of this man that was still... normal, still human. Maybe I could find a crack in the façade that would explain all of this. Or maybe I was walking straight into a trap.

When he greeted me outside a café, his smile was just as flawless as it always had been. But now, I couldn’t unsee the truth. I couldn’t shake the image of the photograph, the knowledge that he had been standing beside my great-uncle, looking exactly the same as he did now. How long had he been hiding this? And why?

“You seem distant today,” Lei said, his eyes narrowing slightly as we sat down. “Is everything alright?”

I forced a smile, fighting the growing panic in my chest. “Yeah, just... didn’t sleep too well last night.”

He studied me carefully, too carefully, as if he knew I was hiding something. There was something in his gaze that I hadn’t noticed before, something calculating and cold. I could feel my pulse racing, the walls of the café closing in around me.

I needed to leave.

But before I could excuse myself, Lei’s hand reached across the table, resting lightly on mine. His touch, once so warm and reassuring, now felt like ice. “You’ve been different lately,” he said, his voice too smooth, too controlled. “Distracted.”

I swallowed hard, trying to pull my hand away, but his grip tightened.

I yanked my hand free, my heart pounding in my chest. “I... I need to go.”

Lei’s expression didn’t change, but there was something in his eyes that sent a shiver down my spine. He knew. He knew I had seen something, and now there was no going back.

I left the café in a rush, not daring to look back. My hands were trembling as I hurried down the street, my mind racing. I needed to figure out what I was dealing with, but who could help me? The police? No, they’d think I was insane. My friends? They were thousands of miles away, and besides, they wouldn’t understand. No one would.

Except maybe... the lawyer.

The thought hit me like a lightning bolt. He had been so dismissive, so eager to hand off my uncle’s estate and wash his hands of it. But now that I thought about it, there had been something strange about the way he avoided answering my questions about my family’s past. Maybe he knew more than he let on. Maybe he could help me understand what was happening.

I grabbed my phone and dialed his number, my fingers shaking as I pressed it to my ear.

“Hello?” His voice crackled through the line, sharp and impatient.

“It’s me,” I said, trying to keep my voice steady. “I need to talk to you. It’s about my uncle... something really strange is going on.”

There was a pause on the other end, longer than I expected. When he finally spoke, his voice was quieter, more measured. “Meet me at my office. We’ll talk.”

I hung up, a knot of anxiety twisting in my gut. The way he had said it, ""we’ll talk,"" felt loaded with meaning. He knew something. I could feel it.

The lawyer’s office was tucked away in a quiet corner of the city, the kind of place you wouldn’t notice unless you were looking for it. The building was unremarkable, with peeling paint and a small sign that looked like it hadn’t been changed in years. I wasn’t sure why I had come here, but my instincts told me this was my only lead. If anyone could give me answers about my uncle’s strange past, it would be Mr. Feng.

I stepped inside, the musty smell of old paper and dust greeting me. He sat behind his desk, his sharp eyes flicking up from a stack of documents as I entered.

“I thought you were done with the estate,” he muttered, setting his papers aside.

I shook my head, suddenly unsure how to begin. “It’s not about the estate. I’ve... I’ve found something. Something strange.”

He leaned back in his chair, his expression shifting from mild annoyance to curiosity. “Go on.”

I hesitated, pulling the photograph from my bag and sliding it across the desk. He glanced at it, his brow furrowing as he examined the faded image of my great-uncle and Lei standing together, decades ago.

“This photo. It’s old,” I said, my voice barely above a whisper. “But the man in it... He hasn’t aged. That’s Lei. The same man I’ve been seeing for the past few weeks. He looks exactly the same.”

Mr. Feng’s face paled as his fingers tightened around the photograph. He stared at it for a long moment, then placed it carefully on the desk, his hands trembling slightly.

“Where did you find this?” he asked, his voice quieter now, tinged with something I couldn’t quite place. Fear, maybe.

“In my uncle’s house,” I replied. “I was going through his things and... I don’t know. I can’t explain it. But something about Lei. There’s something wrong with him.”

He sighed heavily, rubbing a hand over his face. He seemed older now, more worn down than when I had first met him. “I had hoped this wouldn’t happen,” he muttered to himself. Then, louder: “Your uncle was involved in something. Something he didn’t want to talk about.”

I leaned forward. “What do you mean? What was he involved in?”

He stood up, pacing behind his desk. “Your family has been in Shanghai for generations. There are old stories, legends about strange things happening to people connected to your bloodline. Disappearances, sightings, people aging too quickly or not at all. I thought it was just nonsense, superstitions passed down through the years. But when I saw your uncle’s estate and how quickly he wanted it all handled, I suspected something else.”

He paused, glancing at the photograph again. “But this... this is proof.”

My mouth went dry. “Proof of what?”

“Proof that whatever your uncle was trying to escape has come back. And now it’s after you.”

The words hung in the air, heavy and suffocating. I shook my head, trying to process what he was saying. “Lei isn’t... he’s not human, is he?”

Mr. Feng didn’t answer right away. He seemed to struggle with the words, finally saying, “There’s an old legend, one that speaks of creatures that can take the form of humans. They use their appearance to deceive, to lure people in. These creatures, these painted skin demons, have been around for centuries, feeding on those they can trap.”

I felt a wave of nausea wash over me, my vision blurring as the reality of what he was saying set in. “And you think... you think Lei is one of them?”

He nodded grimly. “I’m almost certain. Your uncle tried to run from this, but he wasn’t fast enough. You need to leave Shanghai. Now.”

I stood up, my legs shaky. “But how... how do I stop him? How do I get away?”

He looked at me with pity in his eyes. “I don’t know if you can. But you need to try.”

I left Mr. Feng’s office with a cold knot of fear in my stomach. The streets outside were busy as always, but everything felt distant, muffled, like I was moving through a dream I couldn’t wake up from. The world around me no longer felt real. Nothing did.

My mind raced as I hurried back to my apartment. Mr. Feng’s words echoed in my head, each one tightening the noose of dread around my chest. Painted skin demon. The idea sounded ridiculous, something pulled straight out of a horror movie. But the photograph, Lei... I couldn’t ignore the truth anymore. I had seen it with my own eyes. I had felt it in my gut. Lei wasn’t human, and now I was part of whatever dark game he was playing.

I fumbled with the keys to my apartment, my hands shaking as I let myself inside. The door slammed shut behind me, and I locked it quickly, as if the flimsy bolt could keep something like him out. The apartment was quiet, too quiet. I moved to the window, pulling the curtains shut, trying to block out the city beyond. For the first time since I’d arrived in Shanghai, I felt trapped, cornered by something I didn’t understand.

I needed to leave. Mr. Feng was right; there was no point in trying to confront Lei. I had to get as far away from him as possible. My flight back to the United States wasn’t scheduled for another week, but I couldn’t wait that long. I had to find a way out now.

I packed quickly, throwing my belongings into my suitcase with shaking hands. As I zipped up the bag, my phone buzzed on the table. The screen lit up with a message from Lei.

“Dinner tonight? I miss you.”

My heart lurched in my chest. The words were innocent, casual even, but now they sent a jolt of terror through me. He knew. He had to know. Why else would he reach out now, after everything? I stared at the message, my hands cold and clammy, before forcing myself to respond.

“I’m not feeling well. Maybe another time.”

I set the phone down and took a deep breath, trying to calm the frantic rhythm of my heartbeat. I didn’t have much time. I needed to book a flight, get out of the apartment, and disappear before Lei realized what I was doing.

I was about to start searching for flights when the phone buzzed again. Another message.

“I can come over. Take care of you.”

I dropped the phone, my pulse spiking. He was too close, too eager. I had to move. Now.

I grabbed my suitcase and darted toward the door. Just as I reached for the handle, there was a knock. Three sharp raps echoed through the apartment like a death knell.

“Hey! it’s me.”

Lei’s voice...

I stumbled back from the door, my mind spinning. How had he gotten here so fast? I hadn’t even told him where I lived, had I? Panic surged through me as the knocking came again, louder this time.

“Are you in there?” Lei’s voice was smooth, calm, but there was an edge to it now, something that made my skin crawl. “You didn’t answer my message.”

I clutched my suitcase, my back pressed against the far wall of the apartment. I could hear him moving outside the door, his footsteps slow, deliberate, like he was waiting for something.

“I know you’re in there,” he said softly, almost playfully now. “Don’t you want to see me?”

I didn’t respond. I couldn’t. Every instinct in my body was screaming for me to stay silent, to keep as far away from the door as possible. But I knew I couldn’t stay here. I had to get out. My eyes darted around the apartment, searching for an escape.

The fire escape. My window led to the back of the building, where the fire escape ladder could take me down to the alley below. It wasn’t much of a plan, but it was the only chance I had. I moved as quietly as I could, tiptoeing toward the window. I slid it open slowly, wincing at the faint creak of the hinges.

Just as I was about to climb out, my phone buzzed again. Another message.

“Where do you think you’re going?”

My stomach twisted. I looked down at the phone in horror. There was no way he could have known. Unless he could see me.

I didn’t have time to think. I clambered out the window, gripping the cold metal of the fire escape as I hurried down the ladder, my breath coming in ragged gasps. The alley was dark and narrow, the shadows thick between the buildings. I hit the ground running, my suitcase dragging behind me as I raced toward the street. I didn’t know where I was going; all I knew was that I needed to get away.

The city felt like a maze, the streets twisting and turning, leading me nowhere. My mind was racing, a jumble of fear and panic that blurred the world around me. I had no plan, no clear destination. I just kept running, hoping that the distance would be enough to keep him away.

But it wasn’t long before I realized that something was wrong.

No matter how far I ran, no matter how many streets I crossed, I couldn’t shake the feeling that Lei was still close. Too close. Every time I glanced over my shoulder, I thought I saw him, just a flicker of movement in the crowd, a face too familiar among the strangers passing by.

I ducked into a nearby café, my chest heaving as I tried to catch my breath. I couldn’t keep running like this. I needed to get out of Shanghai, and fast. I couldn’t just sit here, waiting for him to find me. I grabbed my phone and started scrolling through flights. There was a late-night flight leaving for the United States in a few hours. It was expensive, but I didn’t care. I booked it without thinking, my hands trembling as I entered my payment details.

For a moment, I allowed myself to exhale, feeling the tension in my body loosen just a little. The café was quiet, a small bubble of normalcy amid the chaos that had consumed my life. The low hum of conversations and the clinking of coffee cups gave me a false sense of comfort. I looked around. No sign of Lei. He wasn’t here. Not now.

I slid further into the booth, my legs trembling beneath the table. The adrenaline that had been keeping me on my feet for hours was starting to wear off, replaced by a deep, bone-weary exhaustion. I had barely slept in days, and now that I was sitting still, the weight of everything was crashing down on me. My body was screaming for rest, but my mind wouldn’t stop racing. Every nerve in my body told me to stay alert, to keep moving, but I couldn’t anymore. Just for a moment, I told myself. Just a moment to close my eyes and breathe. I must have only intended to rest for a minute or two, but exhaustion claimed me completely.

I don’t know how long I had been asleep, maybe an hour, maybe less, but when I woke, the café felt different. The air was thick, stifling, and there was a strange silence that hung heavy in the room.

I was still winking the sleep away when suddenly , the screen lit up with a new message.

“You can’t hide from me.”

A cold wave of terror crashed over me, snapping me out of my drowsy haze. I had fallen asleep. I had let my guard down, and now... now he was here. Or close. I shoved my phone into my bag and bolted for the door .

I burst onto the street, my pulse racing as I frantically scanned the crowd for any sign of Lei. Every shadow, every figure felt like a threat, like he was lurking just out of view. I couldn't see him, but I knew he was there. Watching. Waiting.

I waved down the first taxi I saw, nearly tripping over myself as I climbed into the backseat. The driver barely glanced at me as I gave him the address for the airport, my voice shaky and strained. He pulled away from the curb, the hum of the engine a faint comfort as the city began to blur past the windows.

I gripped the edge of the seat, trying to steady my breathing. The flight was booked, and I had a few hours left to make it to the airport. All I had to do was get on that plane. Once I was in the air, once I left Shanghai, I’d be free. At least, that’s what I told myself.

But the uneasy feeling that had settled in the pit of my stomach refused to fade. Lei had found me so easily before. How had he known I was in the café? How had he always been one step ahead?

The taxi began slowing down.

I glanced up and I saw a pair of red taillights ahead, blinking in the dark. There was a construction vehicle blocking the road, a detour sign flashing in the dim light. The driver sighed, pulling the car to a stop.

“Looks like we’ll have to take a different route,” he muttered, glancing at me in the rearview mirror.

I nodded, but something felt... off. The street was too quiet, the shadows too thick. I couldn’t shake the feeling that Lei was still close, no matter how fast I tried to escape.

Suddenly, a loud bang shattered the silence.

I gasped as the passenger window exploded inward, glass raining down like shards of ice. My heart seized in my chest as I turned to see him: Lei. His hand gripping the edge of the broken window, his dark eyes locking onto mine. He moved too fast, too silent, like a predator that had been lurking in the shadows all along.

His hand lunged through the window, reaching for me with terrifying speed. His fingers grazed my arm, cold and unyielding. I jerked back, my heart hammering in my throat, but his grip was like iron, tightening around my wrist. He pulled harder, his strength inhuman, dragging me toward the shattered window, shards of glass cutting into my skin.

""You’re not leaving,"" he growled, his voice low and menacing, sending a chill down my spine. ""You’ll never leave me.""

The driver let out a panicked shout, and the car lurched forward with a screech of tires. The sudden momentum ripped Lei's grip from my wrist and sent him crashing to the ground with brutal force.

The driver swore loudly, the air thick with panic.

I dared a glance over my shoulder, terrified of what I might see.

In the middle of the road, Lei rose slowly to his feet, his movements unnaturally fluid. His head tilted slightly, his eyes locked on the taxi, and a twisted smile crept across his face.

""GO! PLEASE!"" I screamed, my voice cracking as I whipped back toward the driver.

The driver, pale and wide-eyed, nodded frantically, slamming his foot down on the gas pedal.

The moment the taxi pulled up to the airport, a wave of relief washed over me. I was almost there, just a few steps away from leaving Shanghai, from leaving Lei behind. The terminal was busy, packed with travelers hurrying to their gates, dragging luggage and speaking in rapid-fire conversations that blurred together. It was all so normal, so ordinary, that for the first time in days, I felt a flicker of hope.

I just had to make it through.

Dragging my suitcase behind me, I made my way through the throngs of people. I glanced at the departures board, my eyes darting to the flight that would take me back to Houston.

I made my way directly to the boarding gate, and just nearby, I spotted a restroom. Needing a moment to collect myself, I headed into the women’s restroom, eager for a brief escape before boarding. The room was silent and empty, the cold fluorescent lights flickering overhead. Setting my bag down, I splashed cold water on my face, hoping to wash away the fear that clung to me like a shadow.

For a moment, I closed my eyes and breathed deeply. Just a few more minutes. I’ll be in the air, away from all of this.

But when I opened my eyes, everything changed.

Standing behind me in the mirror.. Lei’s reflection filled the space just inches away. His eyes.. those cold..dark eyes, burned with something far more sinister than before. My heart seized in my chest as I spun around, but before I could scream, he lunged at me, his hand wrapping around my throat.

My breath hitched as his cold fingers closed tightly, squeezing the air from my lungs.

Before I could fight back, he lifted me off the ground as if I weighed nothing, his hand tightening around my neck. My feet dangled uselessly in the air, kicking wildly as panic flooded through me. The cold, tiled floor below seemed to stretch away, the world blurring around the edges of my vision...

I clawed at his hand, my nails digging into his skin, but it didn’t matter. His grip didn’t loosen. He held me effortlessly, his dark eyes watching me with that same eerie calm, as if this were all part of some twisted game.

My chest burned, desperate for air. I gasped, but nothing came. My pulse pounded in my ears, and black spots danced at the corners of my vision. The pressure on my throat was unbearable. Every second, it grew tighter, crushing me from the inside out.

He leaned in closer, his voice a low, mocking whisper. “You really thought you could get away from me?”

My mind raced, desperate for a way out, for anything that could save me. But the bathroom was empty, and his grip was relentless.

Then, the door swung open.

A security guard stepped inside, his expression turning to confusion as he saw Lei in the women’s restroom. “Hey!” he called out, stepping forward.

LET GO OF HER!”

Lei didn’t even flinch. His grip loosened on my neck for just a second, but it was enough for me to gasp for air, my body shaking with terror. The guard reached for Lei, trying to pull him away from me, but Lei moved too quickly. He turned on the guard, shoving him backward with a force that sent him crashing to the floor.

They struggled, the guard trying to fight back, but Lei was too strong, too fast. Lei grabbed the guard by the collar and slammed him against the wall with a brutal strength I hadn’t fully understood until now.

But in that moment, I saw my chance.

Without thinking, I ran toward the door, my legs trembling beneath me. I pushed it open and stumbled out into the busy terminal, gasping for air as I ran toward the gate.

The terminal was crowded, a sea of people rushing toward their gates. I ducked into the flow of bodies, weaving through the mass of travelers. I could still hear the sounds of the struggle behind me, but I didn’t dare look back. I had to reach the gate. I had to get on that plane.

I could feel Lei’s presence behind me, even if he wasn’t there. His voice still echoed in my mind, his hands still wrapped around my throat.

When I reached the gate, it was already boarding. The crowd of passengers offered me the cover I needed. I merged into the line, keeping my head down, my hands shaking as I handed my ticket to the agent. She smiled and waved me through, unaware of the terror that had been stalking me for days.

I stepped onto the plane, the cool, pressurized air hitting me like a wave. Rows of seats stretched out in front of me, passengers already settled, tucking bags into overhead compartments and chatting quietly. I moved through the aisle like a ghost, my mind still racing, scanning every face for any sign of Lei. But he wasn’t here. Not anymore.

I found my seat near the back of the plane, squeezing past a woman engrossed in her book, her headphones firmly in place. I sank into the window seat, my hands shaking as I buckled the seatbelt. The hum of the engines below was a faint comfort, something steady in the chaos.

The pit in my stomach tightened as the plane gathered speed, racing faster and faster down the runway. My fingers gripped the armrests, the tension rising with every passing second. I stared out the window, watching as the ground blurred beneath us, the airport shrinking away as the nose of the plane lifted into the sky.

I had escaped.

Or so I thought.

As I sat there, staring out the window, I felt a strange tingling in my hand. I looked down, and my blood froze. There, on the inside of my palm, was a mark, faint, barely visible, but undeniably there. A thin crack, like the ones I had seen on Lei’s skin, ran across the surface of my hand. It was as if a part of him had stayed with me, even now, even after I had escaped.

I clenched my fist, trying to ignore the chill creeping up my spine. I had made it onto the plane. I was leaving Shanghai. But I knew, deep down, that I hadn’t truly escaped him.

I could still feel his presence. [Watching](https://www.youtube.com/@herscreams). Waiting.",1,1728136660.0,Horror_stories,0,1.0,False

We were off and on in our twenties but I’d say added up we’re going on 10-11 years all together. We’ve been married 5 years now and have 2 kids 3 and 1.5. I don’t think my wife is into me anymore. We do still have sex but she hasn’t initiated or even seemed into it in like 2.5 years. It almost feels like she’s doing a chore. I’ve talked to her about it and and she says she’s just exhausted and it’s not personal. That being said for the past 18 months I’ve made it a point to prioritize our marriage. I make sure she knows I’m always thinking of her by saying it but also doing small things like grabbing her a coffee or a little surprise when I go to the store, I make sure I give her solid breaks from the kids by going out with her friends or getting her massage packages or giving her some money to go buy herself w.e she wants. I’ll intentionally make it a point to listen to the little things she needs and then doing my best to fulfill those needs. I genuinely listen to her talk every time she talks to my, and I genuinely tell her about my day or w.e she asks about. After 5pm I don’t use my phone because I want to be the best and most attentive husband/father I can be. I’m trying so hard to rebuild a spark between us, Ive had a couple conversations with her about how I’m feeling and make it a point to meet hwr needs in regard to nonsexual intimacy. I just feel unwanted and like my wife is no longer attracted to me. Idk what else to do, she says she’s tired and doesn’t feel good about herself a lot but idk what else I can do to help her feel better about herself. I tell her she’s a beautiful, sexy woman all the time. If that’s truly her issue why won’t she do anything to help herself have a better self image?

I get online. I check reddit and facebook. I think about what I would say if I were to make a post, but rarely do. I get nostalgic for the old days of online journaling. I sink into how my loneliness feels. My body is heavy. My arms are dead weights resting on the arms of my office chair. I shed a few tears.

Most of my evenings in front of a screen. I think about what I could do to develop some kind of identity. I put on a movie on and go to sleep.

I Wish I Hadn't,"I arrived in Shanghai under a haze of jet lag and grief. The city’s chaotic energy did little to ease the numbness that had settled in my bones. I hadn’t returned to China since I was a child, and even then, it was a fleeting visit, a brief encounter with distant relatives I never thought I’d see again. Now, I was back to settle an estate that felt more like a burden than a gift.

The death of my uncle, a man I barely knew, had summoned me here. I had only vague memories of him from my childhood, blurry images of a quiet man standing at the edge of family gatherings. When I was contacted by the lawyer handling his estate, the news didn’t hit me with the shock one might expect. Instead, it felt like a summons, an obligation to a man whose life had been a mystery to me. Still, I accepted out of duty more than curiosity, and now found myself in the heart of a city that thrived on life, while I felt nothing but the weight of death.

After dealing with the legal formalities, I wandered through the neon-lit streets, the skyscrapers towering above me, casting long shadows that seemed to reach out like fingers in the night. The lawyer had been distant, dismissive even, handing me the keys to the old family property with little more than a formal nod. ""It's all in your hands now,"" he had said, and the words echoed in my mind, heavy with implication. What did he mean by that?

I found myself by the river, watching the lights from the Bund reflect on the water. The city hummed with life around me, but it felt as though I was drifting, disconnected, a stranger in my own family’s history. That’s when I saw him.

He stood casually by the railing, his silhouette illuminated by the glow of the skyline. There was something about him that caught my attention immediately. Perhaps it was the way he stood, confident yet reserved, or the way his eyes flickered toward me before I had even realized I was staring. He didn’t belong to the crowd; that much was clear. He seemed... separate, like a fragment of the night itself.

""Beautiful night, isn't it?""

His voice was smooth, almost melodic, breaking through the ambient noise of the city. There was a warmth in his tone that made the hairs on the back of my neck rise, an unsettling, magnetic pull.

I hesitated for a moment before responding. ""It is,"" I said softly, unsure why I was suddenly nervous. His gaze was intense, almost too intense, but there was an undeniable charm in his smile. I found myself drawn to him, feeling a spark of something I hadn’t felt since I’d arrived, a connection in a place that had so far made me feel utterly alone.

""Lei.. he introduced himself, holding out a hand. His grip was firm but cold, a subtle chill that lingered even after he released it.

We fell into an easy conversation as we walked along the riverside, the lights of the city shimmering on the surface of the water beside us. Lei was charismatic, attentive in a way that made me forget, if only for a moment, why I was even in Shanghai. He asked about me, about my life, but deflected when I asked about his. Mysterious, I thought. Maybe a little too mysterious, but I was intrigued. After all, what harm was there in a little distraction from the heaviness of death?

By the time we parted ways, exchanging numbers, I felt a strange sense of relief. For the first time since I’d arrived, I wasn’t alone. But as I made my way back to the sleek, modern apartment I was renting, I couldn’t shake the feeling that Lei had been watching me long before I had noticed him.

The following days passed in a blur of paperwork and phone calls. The estate had more complications than I expected, deeds, assets, and family relics I had never heard of. Each conversation with the lawyer brought new surprises, like my uncle’s ownership of an old house tucked away in one of Shanghai’s forgotten districts. The thought of going there alone made me uneasy, so I kept putting it off. Something about the way the lawyer had brushed off questions about the house felt wrong, as though he didn’t want to talk about it.

But in between the stress, there was Lei.

We had been seeing each other almost every day. Dinners, late-night walks, and quiet conversations in quiet cafes. It was easy to get lost in his charm, his ease of conversation, the way he seemed to understand everything without me having to explain. Still, I couldn’t help but feel there was something he wasn’t telling me, something just beneath the surface. He would smile, but sometimes the smile didn’t quite reach his eyes.

One night, after a particularly grueling day dealing with the estate, Lei invited me to his apartment. The invitation felt natural, a progression in what had quickly become a relationship .

His apartment was on the outskirts of the city, in a high-rise that seemed out of place among the old neighborhoods it towered over. The interior was modern, sleek, and spotless. Yet it felt sterile. There were no personal touches, no photos or signs of a life lived. Just perfect, polished surfaces.

“You must be exhausted,” Lei said, as he poured me a glass of wine. I nodded, trying to shake off the unease creeping up my spine. The warmth of the wine helped a little, but the coldness of the apartment clung to me.

As we sat together on his pristine couch, I couldn’t help but notice how still he was. Too still. His movements, usually smooth and graceful, now seemed rehearsed, like each gesture was part of an intricate performance. And then, for the briefest moment, I saw it.

A crack.

It was small, barely noticeable, but it ran along the edge of his jawline. At first, I thought it was a trick of the light, but when I blinked, it was gone, as if it had never been there. My breath hitched in my throat. I wanted to ask him, to say something, but the words died before they left my lips. I stared at my wine glass instead, forcing myself to relax, to ignore what I had just seen.

“Is something wrong?” Lei’s voice cut through my thoughts, soft but probing.

I shook my head quickly, plastering on a smile. “No, I’m just... tired.”

He watched me for a moment, his dark eyes unreadable, before nodding. “Of course. It’s been a long week for you.”

His hand touched mine, cold against my skin, and for a second, I could swear I felt that same crack beneath his fingers. A chill raced through me, but I said nothing.

The days that followed should have felt normal, but nothing did. My work with the estate became an afterthought, replaced by an obsession I couldn’t shake: Lei. Something about him gnawed at my mind, filling every quiet moment with unease. I kept replaying that night in his apartment, convincing myself that the crack I’d seen was just a trick of my exhausted mind.

But the more I tried to rationalize it, the worse the feeling became. It wasn’t just that. He was changing, or at least, my perception of him was. Small things, barely noticeable at first. His voice would sometimes sound too smooth, almost unnatural. His movements, always so graceful, seemed too deliberate, like they were mimicked rather than natural.

And the dreams... They started shortly after that night in his apartment.

In the first dream, I was standing at the foot of Lei’s bed. He was lying there, asleep, but something was wrong. His face was smooth and flawless as always, but then, slowly, the skin began to peel away. It didn’t bleed, and there was no pain, just layers of flesh slipping off, revealing something hideous underneath. A twisted, contorted face with hollow eyes that stared back at me. I tried to scream, but no sound came.

I woke in a cold sweat, my heart pounding, the sheets tangled around me. It was just a dream, I told myself, over and over again.

The next few days passed in a blur of paranoia. Every time I met with Lei, I couldn’t shake the feeling that he was watching me too closely, studying me. And the crack I’d seen that night? It started appearing more often. Sometimes it was on his jaw, sometimes his hands. Each time it would disappear before I could get a second look, but I knew it wasn’t just my imagination.

One afternoon, I decided it was finally time to visit my uncle’s old house. The place had been left untouched for years, gathering dust and sinking into disrepair. The lawyer’s vague descriptions and dismissiveness had only fueled my curiosity. I had been avoiding it, reluctant to confront whatever history might be buried there, but the weight of uncertainty was starting to suffocate me.

The house stood at the end of a narrow street, hidden among overgrown trees and faded stone walls. It was a stark contrast to the sleek, modern apartment I had been staying in. Everything about this place felt old, forgotten, like it belonged to a different era altogether. I pushed open the creaking door, a rush of stale air hitting me as I stepped inside.

I spent hours going through piles of papers, yellowed books, and fading family mementos. My uncle’s life was scattered across the rooms, half-forgotten, and for a while, it felt like I was drowning in someone else’s memories. The deeper I dug, the more disoriented I became. Dusty photographs, letters written in fading ink, items that seemed to have no connection to me at all.

At the bottom of a worn leather box, buried beneath stacks of old papers, was an old photograph. The paper was fragile, worn around the edges, but it was the faces in the picture that sent a chill through me. I stared at the image, two men standing side by side. One of them I recognized immediately as my great-uncle, though he was much younger in the picture. But it was the man beside him that made my skin crawl.

It was Lei...

The photograph had to be at least 60 years old, judging by the way the men were dressed. Yet Lei looked exactly the same as he did now. His face was unchanged, smooth, flawless, and unaged. The realization hit me like a blow to the chest, my hands trembling as I held the picture closer to examine it. No one could look the same after all this time.

I flipped the photograph over, hoping for some explanation, but the back was blank. No dates, no names, nothing that could tell me who these men were to each other or why this picture existed. A wave of nausea rolled through me. It wasn’t just Lei's unnerving perfection anymore. There was something far darker at play here, something that had been lurking in the shadows of my family long before I arrived in Shanghai.

The air in the room felt thick, suffocating, and I suddenly had the overwhelming urge to leave. I shoved the photograph into my bag and rushed out of the house, not bothering to lock the door behind me.

As I walked back to the apartment, the city’s noise became distant, muffled by the thoughts crashing through my mind. Lei wasn’t human. He couldn’t be. The photograph was proof, proof that he had existed far longer than any normal person should. But why? And why was he here, now, in my life? The questions spun wildly in my head, but no answers came. I felt a growing sense of dread, as if the world around me was closing in.

That night, I lay awake in bed, the photograph resting on the table beside me. I couldn’t stop thinking about it. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw Lei’s face, his perfect, unchanging face, and the crack I had seen on his skin.

The next morning, I woke up feeling heavy, as though the weight of the photograph had settled deep inside my chest, squeezing my lungs. I hadn’t slept well. Every creak in the apartment made me bolt upright, expecting to find Lei standing in the shadows, watching me. The rational part of my brain kept trying to soothe me, to tell me that I was overreacting, but the photograph on the table beside me said otherwise.

I couldn’t just ignore it. I needed answers, but I wasn’t sure how to get them. Who could I even trust at this point?

I decided to meet Lei later that day. I wasn’t ready to confront him, not yet, but I needed to see him. I needed to figure out if there was any part of this man that was still... normal, still human. Maybe I could find a crack in the façade that would explain all of this. Or maybe I was walking straight into a trap.

When he greeted me outside a café, his smile was just as flawless as it always had been. But now, I couldn’t unsee the truth. I couldn’t shake the image of the photograph, the knowledge that he had been standing beside my great-uncle, looking exactly the same as he did now. How long had he been hiding this? And why?

“You seem distant today,” Lei said, his eyes narrowing slightly as we sat down. “Is everything alright?”

I forced a smile, fighting the growing panic in my chest. “Yeah, just... didn’t sleep too well last night.”

He studied me carefully, too carefully, as if he knew I was hiding something. There was something in his gaze that I hadn’t noticed before, something calculating and cold. I could feel my pulse racing, the walls of the café closing in around me.

I needed to leave.

But before I could excuse myself, Lei’s hand reached across the table, resting lightly on mine. His touch, once so warm and reassuring, now felt like ice. “You’ve been different lately,” he said, his voice too smooth, too controlled. “Distracted.”

I swallowed hard, trying to pull my hand away, but his grip tightened.

I yanked my hand free, my heart pounding in my chest. “I... I need to go.”

Lei’s expression didn’t change, but there was something in his eyes that sent a shiver down my spine. He knew. He knew I had seen something, and now there was no going back.

I left the café in a rush, not daring to look back. My hands were trembling as I hurried down the street, my mind racing. I needed to figure out what I was dealing with, but who could help me? The police? No, they’d think I was insane. My friends? They were thousands of miles away, and besides, they wouldn’t understand. No one would.

Except maybe... the lawyer.

The thought hit me like a lightning bolt. He had been so dismissive, so eager to hand off my uncle’s estate and wash his hands of it. But now that I thought about it, there had been something strange about the way he avoided answering my questions about my family’s past. Maybe he knew more than he let on. Maybe he could help me understand what was happening.

I grabbed my phone and dialed his number, my fingers shaking as I pressed it to my ear.

“Hello?” His voice crackled through the line, sharp and impatient.

“It’s me,” I said, trying to keep my voice steady. “I need to talk to you. It’s about my uncle... something really strange is going on.”

There was a pause on the other end, longer than I expected. When he finally spoke, his voice was quieter, more measured. “Meet me at my office. We’ll talk.”

I hung up, a knot of anxiety twisting in my gut. The way he had said it, ""we’ll talk,"" felt loaded with meaning. He knew something. I could feel it.

The lawyer’s office was tucked away in a quiet corner of the city, the kind of place you wouldn’t notice unless you were looking for it. The building was unremarkable, with peeling paint and a small sign that looked like it hadn’t been changed in years. I wasn’t sure why I had come here, but my instincts told me this was my only lead. If anyone could give me answers about my uncle’s strange past, it would be Mr. Feng.

I stepped inside, the musty smell of old paper and dust greeting me. He sat behind his desk, his sharp eyes flicking up from a stack of documents as I entered.

“I thought you were done with the estate,” he muttered, setting his papers aside.

I shook my head, suddenly unsure how to begin. “It’s not about the estate. I’ve... I’ve found something. Something strange.”

He leaned back in his chair, his expression shifting from mild annoyance to curiosity. “Go on.”

I hesitated, pulling the photograph from my bag and sliding it across the desk. He glanced at it, his brow furrowing as he examined the faded image of my great-uncle and Lei standing together, decades ago.

“This photo. It’s old,” I said, my voice barely above a whisper. “But the man in it... He hasn’t aged. That’s Lei. The same man I’ve been seeing for the past few weeks. He looks exactly the same.”

Mr. Feng’s face paled as his fingers tightened around the photograph. He stared at it for a long moment, then placed it carefully on the desk, his hands trembling slightly.

“Where did you find this?” he asked, his voice quieter now, tinged with something I couldn’t quite place. Fear, maybe.

“In my uncle’s house,” I replied. “I was going through his things and... I don’t know. I can’t explain it. But something about Lei. There’s something wrong with him.”

He sighed heavily, rubbing a hand over his face. He seemed older now, more worn down than when I had first met him. “I had hoped this wouldn’t happen,” he muttered to himself. Then, louder: “Your uncle was involved in something. Something he didn’t want to talk about.”

I leaned forward. “What do you mean? What was he involved in?”

He stood up, pacing behind his desk. “Your family has been in Shanghai for generations. There are old stories, legends about strange things happening to people connected to your bloodline. Disappearances, sightings, people aging too quickly or not at all. I thought it was just nonsense, superstitions passed down through the years. But when I saw your uncle’s estate and how quickly he wanted it all handled, I suspected something else.”

He paused, glancing at the photograph again. “But this... this is proof.”

My mouth went dry. “Proof of what?”

“Proof that whatever your uncle was trying to escape has come back. And now it’s after you.”

The words hung in the air, heavy and suffocating. I shook my head, trying to process what he was saying. “Lei isn’t... he’s not human, is he?”

Mr. Feng didn’t answer right away. He seemed to struggle with the words, finally saying, “There’s an old legend, one that speaks of creatures that can take the form of humans. They use their appearance to deceive, to lure people in. These creatures, these painted skin demons, have been around for centuries, feeding on those they can trap.”

I felt a wave of nausea wash over me, my vision blurring as the reality of what he was saying set in. “And you think... you think Lei is one of them?”

He nodded grimly. “I’m almost certain. Your uncle tried to run from this, but he wasn’t fast enough. You need to leave Shanghai. Now.”

I stood up, my legs shaky. “But how... how do I stop him? How do I get away?”

He looked at me with pity in his eyes. “I don’t know if you can. But you need to try.”

I left Mr. Feng’s office with a cold knot of fear in my stomach. The streets outside were busy as always, but everything felt distant, muffled, like I was moving through a dream I couldn’t wake up from. The world around me no longer felt real. Nothing did.

My mind raced as I hurried back to my apartment. Mr. Feng’s words echoed in my head, each one tightening the noose of dread around my chest. Painted skin demon. The idea sounded ridiculous, something pulled straight out of a horror movie. But the photograph, Lei... I couldn’t ignore the truth anymore. I had seen it with my own eyes. I had felt it in my gut. Lei wasn’t human, and now I was part of whatever dark game he was playing.

I fumbled with the keys to my apartment, my hands shaking as I let myself inside. The door slammed shut behind me, and I locked it quickly, as if the flimsy bolt could keep something like him out. The apartment was quiet, too quiet. I moved to the window, pulling the curtains shut, trying to block out the city beyond. For the first time since I’d arrived in Shanghai, I felt trapped, cornered by something I didn’t understand.

I needed to leave. Mr. Feng was right; there was no point in trying to confront Lei. I had to get as far away from him as possible. My flight back to the United States wasn’t scheduled for another week, but I couldn’t wait that long. I had to find a way out now.

I packed quickly, throwing my belongings into my suitcase with shaking hands. As I zipped up the bag, my phone buzzed on the table. The screen lit up with a message from Lei.

“Dinner tonight? I miss you.”

My heart lurched in my chest. The words were innocent, casual even, but now they sent a jolt of terror through me. He knew. He had to know. Why else would he reach out now, after everything? I stared at the message, my hands cold and clammy, before forcing myself to respond.

“I’m not feeling well. Maybe another time.”

I set the phone down and took a deep breath, trying to calm the frantic rhythm of my heartbeat. I didn’t have much time. I needed to book a flight, get out of the apartment, and disappear before Lei realized what I was doing.

I was about to start searching for flights when the phone buzzed again. Another message.

“I can come over. Take care of you.”

I dropped the phone, my pulse spiking. He was too close, too eager. I had to move. Now.

I grabbed my suitcase and darted toward the door. Just as I reached for the handle, there was a knock. Three sharp raps echoed through the apartment like a death knell.

“Hey! it’s me.”

Lei’s voice...

I stumbled back from the door, my mind spinning. How had he gotten here so fast? I hadn’t even told him where I lived, had I? Panic surged through me as the knocking came again, louder this time.

“Are you in there?” Lei’s voice was smooth, calm, but there was an edge to it now, something that made my skin crawl. “You didn’t answer my message.”

I clutched my suitcase, my back pressed against the far wall of the apartment. I could hear him moving outside the door, his footsteps slow, deliberate, like he was waiting for something.

“I know you’re in there,” he said softly, almost playfully now. “Don’t you want to see me?”

I didn’t respond. I couldn’t. Every instinct in my body was screaming for me to stay silent, to keep as far away from the door as possible. But I knew I couldn’t stay here. I had to get out. My eyes darted around the apartment, searching for an escape.

The fire escape. My window led to the back of the building, where the fire escape ladder could take me down to the alley below. It wasn’t much of a plan, but it was the only chance I had. I moved as quietly as I could, tiptoeing toward the window. I slid it open slowly, wincing at the faint creak of the hinges.

Just as I was about to climb out, my phone buzzed again. Another message.

“Where do you think you’re going?”

My stomach twisted. I looked down at the phone in horror. There was no way he could have known. Unless he could see me.

I didn’t have time to think. I clambered out the window, gripping the cold metal of the fire escape as I hurried down the ladder, my breath coming in ragged gasps. The alley was dark and narrow, the shadows thick between the buildings. I hit the ground running, my suitcase dragging behind me as I raced toward the street. I didn’t know where I was going; all I knew was that I needed to get away.

The city felt like a maze, the streets twisting and turning, leading me nowhere. My mind was racing, a jumble of fear and panic that blurred the world around me. I had no plan, no clear destination. I just kept running, hoping that the distance would be enough to keep him away.

But it wasn’t long before I realized that something was wrong.

No matter how far I ran, no matter how many streets I crossed, I couldn’t shake the feeling that Lei was still close. Too close. Every time I glanced over my shoulder, I thought I saw him, just a flicker of movement in the crowd, a face too familiar among the strangers passing by.

I ducked into a nearby café, my chest heaving as I tried to catch my breath. I couldn’t keep running like this. I needed to get out of Shanghai, and fast. I couldn’t just sit here, waiting for him to find me. I grabbed my phone and started scrolling through flights. There was a late-night flight leaving for the United States in a few hours. It was expensive, but I didn’t care. I booked it without thinking, my hands trembling as I entered my payment details.

For a moment, I allowed myself to exhale, feeling the tension in my body loosen just a little. The café was quiet, a small bubble of normalcy amid the chaos that had consumed my life. The low hum of conversations and the clinking of coffee cups gave me a false sense of comfort. I looked around. No sign of Lei. He wasn’t here. Not now.

I slid further into the booth, my legs trembling beneath the table. The adrenaline that had been keeping me on my feet for hours was starting to wear off, replaced by a deep, bone-weary exhaustion. I had barely slept in days, and now that I was sitting still, the weight of everything was crashing down on me. My body was screaming for rest, but my mind wouldn’t stop racing. Every nerve in my body told me to stay alert, to keep moving, but I couldn’t anymore. Just for a moment, I told myself. Just a moment to close my eyes and breathe. I must have only intended to rest for a minute or two, but exhaustion claimed me completely.

I don’t know how long I had been asleep, maybe an hour, maybe less, but when I woke, the café felt different. The air was thick, stifling, and there was a strange silence that hung heavy in the room.

I was still winking the sleep away when suddenly , the screen lit up with a new message.

“You can’t hide from me.”

A cold wave of terror crashed over me, snapping me out of my drowsy haze. I had fallen asleep. I had let my guard down, and now... now he was here. Or close. I shoved my phone into my bag and bolted for the door .

I burst onto the street, my pulse racing as I frantically scanned the crowd for any sign of Lei. Every shadow, every figure felt like a threat, like he was lurking just out of view. I couldn't see him, but I knew he was there. Watching. Waiting.

I waved down the first taxi I saw, nearly tripping over myself as I climbed into the backseat. The driver barely glanced at me as I gave him the address for the airport, my voice shaky and strained. He pulled away from the curb, the hum of the engine a faint comfort as the city began to blur past the windows.

I gripped the edge of the seat, trying to steady my breathing. The flight was booked, and I had a few hours left to make it to the airport. All I had to do was get on that plane. Once I was in the air, once I left Shanghai, I’d be free. At least, that’s what I told myself.

But the uneasy feeling that had settled in the pit of my stomach refused to fade. Lei had found me so easily before. How had he known I was in the café? How had he always been one step ahead?

The taxi began slowing down.

I glanced up and I saw a pair of red taillights ahead, blinking in the dark. There was a construction vehicle blocking the road, a detour sign flashing in the dim light. The driver sighed, pulling the car to a stop.

“Looks like we’ll have to take a different route,” he muttered, glancing at me in the rearview mirror.

I nodded, but something felt... off. The street was too quiet, the shadows too thick. I couldn’t shake the feeling that Lei was still close, no matter how fast I tried to escape.

Suddenly, a loud bang shattered the silence.

I gasped as the passenger window exploded inward, glass raining down like shards of ice. My heart seized in my chest as I turned to see him: Lei. His hand gripping the edge of the broken window, his dark eyes locking onto mine. He moved too fast, too silent, like a predator that had been lurking in the shadows all along.

His hand lunged through the window, reaching for me with terrifying speed. His fingers grazed my arm, cold and unyielding. I jerked back, my heart hammering in my throat, but his grip was like iron, tightening around my wrist. He pulled harder, his strength inhuman, dragging me toward the shattered window, shards of glass cutting into my skin.

""You’re not leaving,"" he growled, his voice low and menacing, sending a chill down my spine. ""You’ll never leave me.""

The driver let out a panicked shout, and the car lurched forward with a screech of tires. The sudden momentum ripped Lei's grip from my wrist and sent him crashing to the ground with brutal force.

The driver swore loudly, the air thick with panic.

I dared a glance over my shoulder, terrified of what I might see.

In the middle of the road, Lei rose slowly to his feet, his movements unnaturally fluid. His head tilted slightly, his eyes locked on the taxi, and a twisted smile crept across his face.

""GO! PLEASE!"" I screamed, my voice cracking as I whipped back toward the driver.

The driver, pale and wide-eyed, nodded frantically, slamming his foot down on the gas pedal.

The moment the taxi pulled up to the airport, a wave of relief washed over me. I was almost there, just a few steps away from leaving Shanghai, from leaving Lei behind. The terminal was busy, packed with travelers hurrying to their gates, dragging luggage and speaking in rapid-fire conversations that blurred together. It was all so normal, so ordinary, that for the first time in days, I felt a flicker of hope.

I just had to make it through.

Dragging my suitcase behind me, I made my way through the throngs of people. I glanced at the departures board, my eyes darting to the flight that would take me back to Houston.

I made my way directly to the boarding gate, and just nearby, I spotted a restroom. Needing a moment to collect myself, I headed into the women’s restroom, eager for a brief escape before boarding. The room was silent and empty, the cold fluorescent lights flickering overhead. Setting my bag down, I splashed cold water on my face, hoping to wash away the fear that clung to me like a shadow.

For a moment, I closed my eyes and breathed deeply. Just a few more minutes. I’ll be in the air, away from all of this.

But when I opened my eyes, everything changed.

Standing behind me in the mirror.. Lei’s reflection filled the space just inches away. His eyes.. those cold..dark eyes, burned with something far more sinister than before. My heart seized in my chest as I spun around, but before I could scream, he lunged at me, his hand wrapping around my throat.

My breath hitched as his cold fingers closed tightly, squeezing the air from my lungs.

Before I could fight back, he lifted me off the ground as if I weighed nothing, his hand tightening around my neck. My feet dangled uselessly in the air, kicking wildly as panic flooded through me. The cold, tiled floor below seemed to stretch away, the world blurring around the edges of my vision...

I clawed at his hand, my nails digging into his skin, but it didn’t matter. His grip didn’t loosen. He held me effortlessly, his dark eyes watching me with that same eerie calm, as if this were all part of some twisted game.

My chest burned, desperate for air. I gasped, but nothing came. My pulse pounded in my ears, and black spots danced at the corners of my vision. The pressure on my throat was unbearable. Every second, it grew tighter, crushing me from the inside out.

He leaned in closer, his voice a low, mocking whisper. “You really thought you could get away from me?”

My mind raced, desperate for a way out, for anything that could save me. But the bathroom was empty, and his grip was relentless.

Then, the door swung open.

A security guard stepped inside, his expression turning to confusion as he saw Lei in the women’s restroom. “Hey!” he called out, stepping forward.

LET GO OF HER!”

Lei didn’t even flinch. His grip loosened on my neck for just a second, but it was enough for me to gasp for air, my body shaking with terror. The guard reached for Lei, trying to pull him away from me, but Lei moved too quickly. He turned on the guard, shoving him backward with a force that sent him crashing to the floor.

They struggled, the guard trying to fight back, but Lei was too strong, too fast. Lei grabbed the guard by the collar and slammed him against the wall with a brutal strength I hadn’t fully understood until now.

But in that moment, I saw my chance.

Without thinking, I ran toward the door, my legs trembling beneath me. I pushed it open and stumbled out into the busy terminal, gasping for air as I ran toward the gate.

The terminal was crowded, a sea of people rushing toward their gates. I ducked into the flow of bodies, weaving through the mass of travelers. I could still hear the sounds of the struggle behind me, but I didn’t dare look back. I had to reach the gate. I had to get on that plane.

I could feel Lei’s presence behind me, even if he wasn’t there. His voice still echoed in my mind, his hands still wrapped around my throat.

When I reached the gate, it was already boarding. The crowd of passengers offered me the cover I needed. I merged into the line, keeping my head down, my hands shaking as I handed my ticket to the agent. She smiled and waved me through, unaware of the terror that had been stalking me for days.

I stepped onto the plane, the cool, pressurized air hitting me like a wave. Rows of seats stretched out in front of me, passengers already settled, tucking bags into overhead compartments and chatting quietly. I moved through the aisle like a ghost, my mind still racing, scanning every face for any sign of Lei. But he wasn’t here. Not anymore.

I found my seat near the back of the plane, squeezing past a woman engrossed in her book, her headphones firmly in place. I sank into the window seat, my hands shaking as I buckled the seatbelt. The hum of the engines below was a faint comfort, something steady in the chaos.

The pit in my stomach tightened as the plane gathered speed, racing faster and faster down the runway. My fingers gripped the armrests, the tension rising with every passing second. I stared out the window, watching as the ground blurred beneath us, the airport shrinking away as the nose of the plane lifted into the sky.

I had escaped.

Or so I thought.

As I sat there, staring out the window, I felt a strange tingling in my hand. I looked down, and my blood froze. There, on the inside of my palm, was a mark, faint, barely visible, but undeniably there. A thin crack, like the ones I had seen on Lei’s skin, ran across the surface of my hand. It was as if a part of him had stayed with me, even now, even after I had escaped.

I clenched my fist, trying to ignore the chill creeping up my spine. I had made it onto the plane. I was leaving Shanghai. But I knew, deep down, that I hadn’t truly escaped him.

I could still feel his presence. [Watching](https://www.youtube.com/@herscreams). Waiting.",1,1728136573.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

He won't mask except on airplanes and now he's refusing to isolate for a few days when he returns home.

After much fighting and boundary testing, he would (mostly) stay in his office and our bedroom and bathroom for thre days after turning from a trip. 

I'd sleep on the couch, use a separate bathroom, and bring him his meals and coffee.

His office is comfortable and includes a TV and comfy armchair. The master bedroom has an attached bath.

I just feel much safer if we could avoid contact for 3 days after he returns from a trip to make sure he doesn't develop a cold or flu or Covid.

He just referred from a trip after not traveling for a long time and is now planted in an armchair in the living room where I sleep and won't move.

He's constantly tested my boundaries over the last few years about this. Insisting on being in the kitchen insisting on using the other bathroom but this is the worst.

1fwqx0l,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1fwqx0l/i_met_my_soulmate_in_shanghai_i_wish_i_hadnt/,I met my Soulmate in Shanghai.... I Wish I Hadn't,"I arrived in Shanghai under a haze of jet lag and grief. The city’s chaotic energy did little to ease the numbness that had settled in my bones. I hadn’t returned to China since I was a child, and even then, it was a fleeting visit, a brief encounter with distant relatives I never thought I’d see again. Now, I was back to settle an estate that felt more like a burden than a gift.

The death of my uncle, a man I barely knew, had summoned me here. I had only vague memories of him from my childhood, blurry images of a quiet man standing at the edge of family gatherings. When I was contacted by the lawyer handling his estate, the news didn’t hit me with the shock one might expect. Instead, it felt like a summons, an obligation to a man whose life had been a mystery to me. Still, I accepted out of duty more than curiosity, and now found myself in the heart of a city that thrived on life, while I felt nothing but the weight of death.

After dealing with the legal formalities, I wandered through the neon-lit streets, the skyscrapers towering above me, casting long shadows that seemed to reach out like fingers in the night. The lawyer had been distant, dismissive even, handing me the keys to the old family property with little more than a formal nod. ""It's all in your hands now,"" he had said, and the words echoed in my mind, heavy with implication. What did he mean by that?

I found myself by the river, watching the lights from the Bund reflect on the water. The city hummed with life around me, but it felt as though I was drifting, disconnected, a stranger in my own family’s history. That’s when I saw him.

He stood casually by the railing, his silhouette illuminated by the glow of the skyline. There was something about him that caught my attention immediately. Perhaps it was the way he stood, confident yet reserved, or the way his eyes flickered toward me before I had even realized I was staring. He didn’t belong to the crowd; that much was clear. He seemed... separate, like a fragment of the night itself.

""Beautiful night, isn't it?""

His voice was smooth, almost melodic, breaking through the ambient noise of the city. There was a warmth in his tone that made the hairs on the back of my neck rise, an unsettling, magnetic pull.

I hesitated for a moment before responding. ""It is,"" I said softly, unsure why I was suddenly nervous. His gaze was intense, almost too intense, but there was an undeniable charm in his smile. I found myself drawn to him, feeling a spark of something I hadn’t felt since I’d arrived, a connection in a place that had so far made me feel utterly alone.

""Lei.. he introduced himself, holding out a hand. His grip was firm but cold, a subtle chill that lingered even after he released it.

We fell into an easy conversation as we walked along the riverside, the lights of the city shimmering on the surface of the water beside us. Lei was charismatic, attentive in a way that made me forget, if only for a moment, why I was even in Shanghai. He asked about me, about my life, but deflected when I asked about his. Mysterious, I thought. Maybe a little too mysterious, but I was intrigued. After all, what harm was there in a little distraction from the heaviness of death?

By the time we parted ways, exchanging numbers, I felt a strange sense of relief. For the first time since I’d arrived, I wasn’t alone. But as I made my way back to the sleek, modern apartment I was renting, I couldn’t shake the feeling that Lei had been watching me long before I had noticed him.

The following days passed in a blur of paperwork and phone calls. The estate had more complications than I expected, deeds, assets, and family relics I had never heard of. Each conversation with the lawyer brought new surprises, like my uncle’s ownership of an old house tucked away in one of Shanghai’s forgotten districts. The thought of going there alone made me uneasy, so I kept putting it off. Something about the way the lawyer had brushed off questions about the house felt wrong, as though he didn’t want to talk about it.

But in between the stress, there was Lei.

We had been seeing each other almost every day. Dinners, late-night walks, and quiet conversations in quiet cafes. It was easy to get lost in his charm, his ease of conversation, the way he seemed to understand everything without me having to explain. Still, I couldn’t help but feel there was something he wasn’t telling me, something just beneath the surface. He would smile, but sometimes the smile didn’t quite reach his eyes.

One night, after a particularly grueling day dealing with the estate, Lei invited me to his apartment. The invitation felt natural, a progression in what had quickly become a relationship .

His apartment was on the outskirts of the city, in a high-rise that seemed out of place among the old neighborhoods it towered over. The interior was modern, sleek, and spotless. Yet it felt sterile. There were no personal touches, no photos or signs of a life lived. Just perfect, polished surfaces.

“You must be exhausted,” Lei said, as he poured me a glass of wine. I nodded, trying to shake off the unease creeping up my spine. The warmth of the wine helped a little, but the coldness of the apartment clung to me.

As we sat together on his pristine couch, I couldn’t help but notice how still he was. Too still. His movements, usually smooth and graceful, now seemed rehearsed, like each gesture was part of an intricate performance. And then, for the briefest moment, I saw it.

A crack.

It was small, barely noticeable, but it ran along the edge of his jawline. At first, I thought it was a trick of the light, but when I blinked, it was gone, as if it had never been there. My breath hitched in my throat. I wanted to ask him, to say something, but the words died before they left my lips. I stared at my wine glass instead, forcing myself to relax, to ignore what I had just seen.

“Is something wrong?” Lei’s voice cut through my thoughts, soft but probing.

I shook my head quickly, plastering on a smile. “No, I’m just... tired.”

He watched me for a moment, his dark eyes unreadable, before nodding. “Of course. It’s been a long week for you.”

His hand touched mine, cold against my skin, and for a second, I could swear I felt that same crack beneath his fingers. A chill raced through me, but I said nothing.

The days that followed should have felt normal, but nothing did. My work with the estate became an afterthought, replaced by an obsession I couldn’t shake: Lei. Something about him gnawed at my mind, filling every quiet moment with unease. I kept replaying that night in his apartment, convincing myself that the crack I’d seen was just a trick of my exhausted mind.

But the more I tried to rationalize it, the worse the feeling became. It wasn’t just that. He was changing, or at least, my perception of him was. Small things, barely noticeable at first. His voice would sometimes sound too smooth, almost unnatural. His movements, always so graceful, seemed too deliberate, like they were mimicked rather than natural.

And the dreams... They started shortly after that night in his apartment.

In the first dream, I was standing at the foot of Lei’s bed. He was lying there, asleep, but something was wrong. His face was smooth and flawless as always, but then, slowly, the skin began to peel away. It didn’t bleed, and there was no pain, just layers of flesh slipping off, revealing something hideous underneath. A twisted, contorted face with hollow eyes that stared back at me. I tried to scream, but no sound came.

I woke in a cold sweat, my heart pounding, the sheets tangled around me. It was just a dream, I told myself, over and over again.

The next few days passed in a blur of paranoia. Every time I met with Lei, I couldn’t shake the feeling that he was watching me too closely, studying me. And the crack I’d seen that night? It started appearing more often. Sometimes it was on his jaw, sometimes his hands. Each time it would disappear before I could get a second look, but I knew it wasn’t just my imagination.

One afternoon, I decided it was finally time to visit my uncle’s old house. The place had been left untouched for years, gathering dust and sinking into disrepair. The lawyer’s vague descriptions and dismissiveness had only fueled my curiosity. I had been avoiding it, reluctant to confront whatever history might be buried there, but the weight of uncertainty was starting to suffocate me.

The house stood at the end of a narrow street, hidden among overgrown trees and faded stone walls. It was a stark contrast to the sleek, modern apartment I had been staying in. Everything about this place felt old, forgotten, like it belonged to a different era altogether. I pushed open the creaking door, a rush of stale air hitting me as I stepped inside.

I spent hours going through piles of papers, yellowed books, and fading family mementos. My uncle’s life was scattered across the rooms, half-forgotten, and for a while, it felt like I was drowning in someone else’s memories. The deeper I dug, the more disoriented I became. Dusty photographs, letters written in fading ink, items that seemed to have no connection to me at all.

At the bottom of a worn leather box, buried beneath stacks of old papers, was an old photograph. The paper was fragile, worn around the edges, but it was the faces in the picture that sent a chill through me. I stared at the image, two men standing side by side. One of them I recognized immediately as my great-uncle, though he was much younger in the picture. But it was the man beside him that made my skin crawl.

It was Lei...

The photograph had to be at least 60 years old, judging by the way the men were dressed. Yet Lei looked exactly the same as he did now. His face was unchanged, smooth, flawless, and unaged. The realization hit me like a blow to the chest, my hands trembling as I held the picture closer to examine it. No one could look the same after all this time.

I flipped the photograph over, hoping for some explanation, but the back was blank. No dates, no names, nothing that could tell me who these men were to each other or why this picture existed. A wave of nausea rolled through me. It wasn’t just Lei's unnerving perfection anymore. There was something far darker at play here, something that had been lurking in the shadows of my family long before I arrived in Shanghai.

The air in the room felt thick, suffocating, and I suddenly had the overwhelming urge to leave. I shoved the photograph into my bag and rushed out of the house, not bothering to lock the door behind me.

As I walked back to the apartment, the city’s noise became distant, muffled by the thoughts crashing through my mind. Lei wasn’t human. He couldn’t be. The photograph was proof, proof that he had existed far longer than any normal person should. But why? And why was he here, now, in my life? The questions spun wildly in my head, but no answers came. I felt a growing sense of dread, as if the world around me was closing in.

That night, I lay awake in bed, the photograph resting on the table beside me. I couldn’t stop thinking about it. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw Lei’s face, his perfect, unchanging face, and the crack I had seen on his skin.

The next morning, I woke up feeling heavy, as though the weight of the photograph had settled deep inside my chest, squeezing my lungs. I hadn’t slept well. Every creak in the apartment made me bolt upright, expecting to find Lei standing in the shadows, watching me. The rational part of my brain kept trying to soothe me, to tell me that I was overreacting, but the photograph on the table beside me said otherwise.

I couldn’t just ignore it. I needed answers, but I wasn’t sure how to get them. Who could I even trust at this point?

I decided to meet Lei later that day. I wasn’t ready to confront him, not yet, but I needed to see him. I needed to figure out if there was any part of this man that was still... normal, still human. Maybe I could find a crack in the façade that would explain all of this. Or maybe I was walking straight into a trap.

When he greeted me outside a café, his smile was just as flawless as it always had been. But now, I couldn’t unsee the truth. I couldn’t shake the image of the photograph, the knowledge that he had been standing beside my great-uncle, looking exactly the same as he did now. How long had he been hiding this? And why?

“You seem distant today,” Lei said, his eyes narrowing slightly as we sat down. “Is everything alright?”

I forced a smile, fighting the growing panic in my chest. “Yeah, just... didn’t sleep too well last night.”

He studied me carefully, too carefully, as if he knew I was hiding something. There was something in his gaze that I hadn’t noticed before, something calculating and cold. I could feel my pulse racing, the walls of the café closing in around me.

I needed to leave.

But before I could excuse myself, Lei’s hand reached across the table, resting lightly on mine. His touch, once so warm and reassuring, now felt like ice. “You’ve been different lately,” he said, his voice too smooth, too controlled. “Distracted.”

I swallowed hard, trying to pull my hand away, but his grip tightened.

I yanked my hand free, my heart pounding in my chest. “I... I need to go.”

Lei’s expression didn’t change, but there was something in his eyes that sent a shiver down my spine. He knew. He knew I had seen something, and now there was no going back.

I left the café in a rush, not daring to look back. My hands were trembling as I hurried down the street, my mind racing. I needed to figure out what I was dealing with, but who could help me? The police? No, they’d think I was insane. My friends? They were thousands of miles away, and besides, they wouldn’t understand. No one would.

Except maybe... the lawyer.

The thought hit me like a lightning bolt. He had been so dismissive, so eager to hand off my uncle’s estate and wash his hands of it. But now that I thought about it, there had been something strange about the way he avoided answering my questions about my family’s past. Maybe he knew more than he let on. Maybe he could help me understand what was happening.

I grabbed my phone and dialed his number, my fingers shaking as I pressed it to my ear.

“Hello?” His voice crackled through the line, sharp and impatient.

“It’s me,” I said, trying to keep my voice steady. “I need to talk to you. It’s about my uncle... something really strange is going on.”

There was a pause on the other end, longer than I expected. When he finally spoke, his voice was quieter, more measured. “Meet me at my office. We’ll talk.”

I hung up, a knot of anxiety twisting in my gut. The way he had said it, ""we’ll talk,"" felt loaded with meaning. He knew something. I could feel it.

The lawyer’s office was tucked away in a quiet corner of the city, the kind of place you wouldn’t notice unless you were looking for it. The building was unremarkable, with peeling paint and a small sign that looked like it hadn’t been changed in years. I wasn’t sure why I had come here, but my instincts told me this was my only lead. If anyone could give me answers about my uncle’s strange past, it would be Mr. Feng.

I stepped inside, the musty smell of old paper and dust greeting me. He sat behind his desk, his sharp eyes flicking up from a stack of documents as I entered.

“I thought you were done with the estate,” he muttered, setting his papers aside.

I shook my head, suddenly unsure how to begin. “It’s not about the estate. I’ve... I’ve found something. Something strange.”

He leaned back in his chair, his expression shifting from mild annoyance to curiosity. “Go on.”

I hesitated, pulling the photograph from my bag and sliding it across the desk. He glanced at it, his brow furrowing as he examined the faded image of my great-uncle and Lei standing together, decades ago.

“This photo. It’s old,” I said, my voice barely above a whisper. “But the man in it... He hasn’t aged. That’s Lei. The same man I’ve been seeing for the past few weeks. He looks exactly the same.”

Mr. Feng’s face paled as his fingers tightened around the photograph. He stared at it for a long moment, then placed it carefully on the desk, his hands trembling slightly.

“Where did you find this?” he asked, his voice quieter now, tinged with something I couldn’t quite place. Fear, maybe.

“In my uncle’s house,” I replied. “I was going through his things and... I don’t know. I can’t explain it. But something about Lei. There’s something wrong with him.”

He sighed heavily, rubbing a hand over his face. He seemed older now, more worn down than when I had first met him. “I had hoped this wouldn’t happen,” he muttered to himself. Then, louder: “Your uncle was involved in something. Something he didn’t want to talk about.”

I leaned forward. “What do you mean? What was he involved in?”

He stood up, pacing behind his desk. “Your family has been in Shanghai for generations. There are old stories, legends about strange things happening to people connected to your bloodline. Disappearances, sightings, people aging too quickly or not at all. I thought it was just nonsense, superstitions passed down through the years. But when I saw your uncle’s estate and how quickly he wanted it all handled, I suspected something else.”

He paused, glancing at the photograph again. “But this... this is proof.”

My mouth went dry. “Proof of what?”

“Proof that whatever your uncle was trying to escape has come back. And now it’s after you.”

The words hung in the air, heavy and suffocating. I shook my head, trying to process what he was saying. “Lei isn’t... he’s not human, is he?”

Mr. Feng didn’t answer right away. He seemed to struggle with the words, finally saying, “There’s an old legend, one that speaks of creatures that can take the form of humans. They use their appearance to deceive, to lure people in. These creatures, these painted skin demons, have been around for centuries, feeding on those they can trap.”

I felt a wave of nausea wash over me, my vision blurring as the reality of what he was saying set in. “And you think... you think Lei is one of them?”

He nodded grimly. “I’m almost certain. Your uncle tried to run from this, but he wasn’t fast enough. You need to leave Shanghai. Now.”

I stood up, my legs shaky. “But how... how do I stop him? How do I get away?”

He looked at me with pity in his eyes. “I don’t know if you can. But you need to try.”

I left Mr. Feng’s office with a cold knot of fear in my stomach. The streets outside were busy as always, but everything felt distant, muffled, like I was moving through a dream I couldn’t wake up from. The world around me no longer felt real. Nothing did.

My mind raced as I hurried back to my apartment. Mr. Feng’s words echoed in my head, each one tightening the noose of dread around my chest. Painted skin demon. The idea sounded ridiculous, something pulled straight out of a horror movie. But the photograph, Lei... I couldn’t ignore the truth anymore. I had seen it with my own eyes. I had felt it in my gut. Lei wasn’t human, and now I was part of whatever dark game he was playing.

I fumbled with the keys to my apartment, my hands shaking as I let myself inside. The door slammed shut behind me, and I locked it quickly, as if the flimsy bolt could keep something like him out. The apartment was quiet, too quiet. I moved to the window, pulling the curtains shut, trying to block out the city beyond. For the first time since I’d arrived in Shanghai, I felt trapped, cornered by something I didn’t understand.

I needed to leave. Mr. Feng was right; there was no point in trying to confront Lei. I had to get as far away from him as possible. My flight back to the United States wasn’t scheduled for another week, but I couldn’t wait that long. I had to find a way out now.

I packed quickly, throwing my belongings into my suitcase with shaking hands. As I zipped up the bag, my phone buzzed on the table. The screen lit up with a message from Lei.

“Dinner tonight? I miss you.”

My heart lurched in my chest. The words were innocent, casual even, but now they sent a jolt of terror through me. He knew. He had to know. Why else would he reach out now, after everything? I stared at the message, my hands cold and clammy, before forcing myself to respond.

“I’m not feeling well. Maybe another time.”

I set the phone down and took a deep breath, trying to calm the frantic rhythm of my heartbeat. I didn’t have much time. I needed to book a flight, get out of the apartment, and disappear before Lei realized what I was doing.

I was about to start searching for flights when the phone buzzed again. Another message.

“I can come over. Take care of you.”

I dropped the phone, my pulse spiking. He was too close, too eager. I had to move. Now.

I grabbed my suitcase and darted toward the door. Just as I reached for the handle, there was a knock. Three sharp raps echoed through the apartment like a death knell.

“Hey! it’s me.”

Lei’s voice...

I stumbled back from the door, my mind spinning. How had he gotten here so fast? I hadn’t even told him where I lived, had I? Panic surged through me as the knocking came again, louder this time.

“Are you in there?” Lei’s voice was smooth, calm, but there was an edge to it now, something that made my skin crawl. “You didn’t answer my message.”

I clutched my suitcase, my back pressed against the far wall of the apartment. I could hear him moving outside the door, his footsteps slow, deliberate, like he was waiting for something.

“I know you’re in there,” he said softly, almost playfully now. “Don’t you want to see me?”

I didn’t respond. I couldn’t. Every instinct in my body was screaming for me to stay silent, to keep as far away from the door as possible. But I knew I couldn’t stay here. I had to get out. My eyes darted around the apartment, searching for an escape.

The fire escape. My window led to the back of the building, where the fire escape ladder could take me down to the alley below. It wasn’t much of a plan, but it was the only chance I had. I moved as quietly as I could, tiptoeing toward the window. I slid it open slowly, wincing at the faint creak of the hinges.

Just as I was about to climb out, my phone buzzed again. Another message.

“Where do you think you’re going?”

My stomach twisted. I looked down at the phone in horror. There was no way he could have known. Unless he could see me.

I didn’t have time to think. I clambered out the window, gripping the cold metal of the fire escape as I hurried down the ladder, my breath coming in ragged gasps. The alley was dark and narrow, the shadows thick between the buildings. I hit the ground running, my suitcase dragging behind me as I raced toward the street. I didn’t know where I was going; all I knew was that I needed to get away.

The city felt like a maze, the streets twisting and turning, leading me nowhere. My mind was racing, a jumble of fear and panic that blurred the world around me. I had no plan, no clear destination. I just kept running, hoping that the distance would be enough to keep him away.

But it wasn’t long before I realized that something was wrong.

No matter how far I ran, no matter how many streets I crossed, I couldn’t shake the feeling that Lei was still close. Too close. Every time I glanced over my shoulder, I thought I saw him, just a flicker of movement in the crowd, a face too familiar among the strangers passing by.

I ducked into a nearby café, my chest heaving as I tried to catch my breath. I couldn’t keep running like this. I needed to get out of Shanghai, and fast. I couldn’t just sit here, waiting for him to find me. I grabbed my phone and started scrolling through flights. There was a late-night flight leaving for the United States in a few hours. It was expensive, but I didn’t care. I booked it without thinking, my hands trembling as I entered my payment details.

For a moment, I allowed myself to exhale, feeling the tension in my body loosen just a little. The café was quiet, a small bubble of normalcy amid the chaos that had consumed my life. The low hum of conversations and the clinking of coffee cups gave me a false sense of comfort. I looked around. No sign of Lei. He wasn’t here. Not now.

I slid further into the booth, my legs trembling beneath the table. The adrenaline that had been keeping me on my feet for hours was starting to wear off, replaced by a deep, bone-weary exhaustion. I had barely slept in days, and now that I was sitting still, the weight of everything was crashing down on me. My body was screaming for rest, but my mind wouldn’t stop racing. Every nerve in my body told me to stay alert, to keep moving, but I couldn’t anymore. Just for a moment, I told myself. Just a moment to close my eyes and breathe. I must have only intended to rest for a minute or two, but exhaustion claimed me completely.

I don’t know how long I had been asleep, maybe an hour, maybe less, but when I woke, the café felt different. The air was thick, stifling, and there was a strange silence that hung heavy in the room.

I was still winking the sleep away when suddenly , the screen lit up with a new message.

“You can’t hide from me.”

A cold wave of terror crashed over me, snapping me out of my drowsy haze. I had fallen asleep. I had let my guard down, and now... now he was here. Or close. I shoved my phone into my bag and bolted for the door .

I burst onto the street, my pulse racing as I frantically scanned the crowd for any sign of Lei. Every shadow, every figure felt like a threat, like he was lurking just out of view. I couldn't see him, but I knew he was there. Watching. Waiting.

I waved down the first taxi I saw, nearly tripping over myself as I climbed into the backseat. The driver barely glanced at me as I gave him the address for the airport, my voice shaky and strained. He pulled away from the curb, the hum of the engine a faint comfort as the city began to blur past the windows.

I gripped the edge of the seat, trying to steady my breathing. The flight was booked, and I had a few hours left to make it to the airport. All I had to do was get on that plane. Once I was in the air, once I left Shanghai, I’d be free. At least, that’s what I told myself.

But the uneasy feeling that had settled in the pit of my stomach refused to fade. Lei had found me so easily before. How had he known I was in the café? How had he always been one step ahead?

The taxi began slowing down.

I glanced up and I saw a pair of red taillights ahead, blinking in the dark. There was a construction vehicle blocking the road, a detour sign flashing in the dim light. The driver sighed, pulling the car to a stop.

“Looks like we’ll have to take a different route,” he muttered, glancing at me in the rearview mirror.

I nodded, but something felt... off. The street was too quiet, the shadows too thick. I couldn’t shake the feeling that Lei was still close, no matter how fast I tried to escape.

Suddenly, a loud bang shattered the silence.

I gasped as the passenger window exploded inward, glass raining down like shards of ice. My heart seized in my chest as I turned to see him: Lei. His hand gripping the edge of the broken window, his dark eyes locking onto mine. He moved too fast, too silent, like a predator that had been lurking in the shadows all along.

His hand lunged through the window, reaching for me with terrifying speed. His fingers grazed my arm, cold and unyielding. I jerked back, my heart hammering in my throat, but his grip was like iron, tightening around my wrist. He pulled harder, his strength inhuman, dragging me toward the shattered window, shards of glass cutting into my skin.

""You’re not leaving,"" he growled, his voice low and menacing, sending a chill down my spine. ""You’ll never leave me.""

The driver let out a panicked shout, and the car lurched forward with a screech of tires. The sudden momentum ripped Lei's grip from my wrist and sent him crashing to the ground with brutal force.

The driver swore loudly, the air thick with panic.

I dared a glance over my shoulder, terrified of what I might see.

In the middle of the road, Lei rose slowly to his feet, his movements unnaturally fluid. His head tilted slightly, his eyes locked on the taxi, and a twisted smile crept across his face.

""GO! PLEASE!"" I screamed, my voice cracking as I whipped back toward the driver.

The driver, pale and wide-eyed, nodded frantically, slamming his foot down on the gas pedal.

The moment the taxi pulled up to the airport, a wave of relief washed over me. I was almost there, just a few steps away from leaving Shanghai, from leaving Lei behind. The terminal was busy, packed with travelers hurrying to their gates, dragging luggage and speaking in rapid-fire conversations that blurred together. It was all so normal, so ordinary, that for the first time in days, I felt a flicker of hope.

I just had to make it through.

Dragging my suitcase behind me, I made my way through the throngs of people. I glanced at the departures board, my eyes darting to the flight that would take me back to Houston.

I made my way directly to the boarding gate, and just nearby, I spotted a restroom. Needing a moment to collect myself, I headed into the women’s restroom, eager for a brief escape before boarding. The room was silent and empty, the cold fluorescent lights flickering overhead. Setting my bag down, I splashed cold water on my face, hoping to wash away the fear that clung to me like a shadow.

For a moment, I closed my eyes and breathed deeply. Just a few more minutes. I’ll be in the air, away from all of this.

But when I opened my eyes, everything changed.

Standing behind me in the mirror.. Lei’s reflection filled the space just inches away. His eyes.. those cold..dark eyes, burned with something far more sinister than before. My heart seized in my chest as I spun around, but before I could scream, he lunged at me, his hand wrapping around my throat.

My breath hitched as his cold fingers closed tightly, squeezing the air from my lungs.

Before I could fight back, he lifted me off the ground as if I weighed nothing, his hand tightening around my neck. My feet dangled uselessly in the air, kicking wildly as panic flooded through me. The cold, tiled floor below seemed to stretch away, the world blurring around the edges of my vision...

I clawed at his hand, my nails digging into his skin, but it didn’t matter. His grip didn’t loosen. He held me effortlessly, his dark eyes watching me with that same eerie calm, as if this were all part of some twisted game.

My chest burned, desperate for air. I gasped, but nothing came. My pulse pounded in my ears, and black spots danced at the corners of my vision. The pressure on my throat was unbearable. Every second, it grew tighter, crushing me from the inside out.

He leaned in closer, his voice a low, mocking whisper. “You really thought you could get away from me?”

My mind raced, desperate for a way out, for anything that could save me. But the bathroom was empty, and his grip was relentless.

Then, the door swung open.

A security guard stepped inside, his expression turning to confusion as he saw Lei in the women’s restroom. “Hey!” he called out, stepping forward.

LET GO OF HER!”

Lei didn’t even flinch. His grip loosened on my neck for just a second, but it was enough for me to gasp for air, my body shaking with terror. The guard reached for Lei, trying to pull him away from me, but Lei moved too quickly. He turned on the guard, shoving him backward with a force that sent him crashing to the floor.

They struggled, the guard trying to fight back, but Lei was too strong, too fast. Lei grabbed the guard by the collar and slammed him against the wall with a brutal strength I hadn’t fully understood until now.

But in that moment, I saw my chance.

Without thinking, I ran toward the door, my legs trembling beneath me. I pushed it open and stumbled out into the busy terminal, gasping for air as I ran toward the gate.

The terminal was crowded, a sea of people rushing toward their gates. I ducked into the flow of bodies, weaving through the mass of travelers. I could still hear the sounds of the struggle behind me, but I didn’t dare look back. I had to reach the gate. I had to get on that plane.

I could feel Lei’s presence behind me, even if he wasn’t there. His voice still echoed in my mind, his hands still wrapped around my throat.

When I reached the gate, it was already boarding. The crowd of passengers offered me the cover I needed. I merged into the line, keeping my head down, my hands shaking as I handed my ticket to the agent. She smiled and waved me through, unaware of the terror that had been stalking me for days.

I stepped onto the plane, the cool, pressurized air hitting me like a wave. Rows of seats stretched out in front of me, passengers already settled, tucking bags into overhead compartments and chatting quietly. I moved through the aisle like a ghost, my mind still racing, scanning every face for any sign of Lei. But he wasn’t here. Not anymore.

I found my seat near the back of the plane, squeezing past a woman engrossed in her book, her headphones firmly in place. I sank into the window seat, my hands shaking as I buckled the seatbelt. The hum of the engines below was a faint comfort, something steady in the chaos.

The pit in my stomach tightened as the plane gathered speed, racing faster and faster down the runway. My fingers gripped the armrests, the tension rising with every passing second. I stared out the window, watching as the ground blurred beneath us, the airport shrinking away as the nose of the plane lifted into the sky.

I had escaped.

Or so I thought.

As I sat there, staring out the window, I felt a strange tingling in my hand. I looked down, and my blood froze. There, on the inside of my palm, was a mark, faint, barely visible, but undeniably there. A thin crack, like the ones I had seen on Lei’s skin, ran across the surface of my hand. It was as if a part of him had stayed with me, even now, even after I had escaped.

I clenched my fist, trying to ignore the chill creeping up my spine. I had made it onto the plane. I was leaving Shanghai. But I knew, deep down, that I hadn’t truly escaped him.

I could still feel his presence. [Watching](https://www.youtube.com/@herscreams). Waiting.

Hi,

I am looking to upgrade my current setup. This can include both my espresso machine and my grinder, but only the machine is also an option.

My partner and I drink all kinds of drinks, mostly milk-based drinks (cappuccino), americano’s and pour over. Around 2-4 drinks per day total.

Here is my current setup:
- DF64 gen 1 grinder, with SSP lab sweet burrs
- Breville Barista Express
- Hario switch (for pour-over)

Also thinking about adding a separate hand grinder for my pour-over coffee’s.

What would you guys recommend to focus on for improving my setup, and which gear do you recommend? My budget is around 2000 euros, a bit higher might also be ok if it is worth the improvement.",1,1728136344.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

# 32

Nairo had often found the grizzlier the crime the more excited the scene was and this one had the electric buzz of a day at the races. Nairo and Ridley hopped out of the police cart after twenty minutes of nudging and fighting their way through the gelatinous after work traffic to find a thronging mass of factory workers forming a mob around the police lines. Nairo politely shoved her way through the crowd while Ridley chose the more democratic approach of shin kicking anyone who got in his way. The sweat and chatter of the excited workers cloyed at her, drowning her in a dozen exotic languages.

“Heard they got exploded…”

“Bits of ‘em be everywhere…”

“Blew a hole a building deep, nothing but a crater left…”

“Naa they got hacked up…”

“Rip to pieces…”

“Must have been Goblins…”

“Revenge…”

Nairo finally arrived, breathless and flustered, at the police lines. Several of the VPD’s heftiest stood arms wide, chests inflated, barking at the onlookers to ‘move on,’ as there was ‘nothing to see here.’

“Sergeant Nairo.” She flashed her badge and scooped her thick hair away from sweaty forehead. “And this is…” she looked around for Ridley and moments later she heard a commotion to her right. There was loud swearing and raised fists before a melee broke out. A few seconds later Ridley came tumbling out of the brawl. He brushed himself down, swore at a Dwarf, and then nodded to the officer and Nairo. 

“He’s with me.”

“Are you sure marm?”

Nairo paused for a moment. 

“Yes.”

Ridley smirked impudently at the officer as they ducked under the police line and walked towards the alley. The chaos of the excited crowd shrank away. The closer they walked to the scene the more it felt like the air was being sucked from their lungs. The electric energy of the chattering crowd dissipated into a mournful hush. There were more officers but these one looked ashen faced and they barely registered Nairo and Ridley’s presence. Nairo nodded at the first couple but she began to feel like a trespasser at a funeral and eventually she too had her eyes glued to the cobbles. As they approached the crime scene there were two detectives at the mouth of the alley sharing a smoke. 

“Afternoon, I’m  Sergeant Nairo.”

“Izla and this is Fisher,” Izla, the taller of the two, answered. 

Both of them had that weary, haunted, look of homicide detectives. Fisher was short and round with a ruddy face and tobacco stains on his teeth. 

“What’s it like in there?” 

“The worst one I’ve ever seen,” Izla said, running a hand through his thinning brown hair. 

“Bits and pieces everywhere,” Fisher added, sipping his cold coffee and taking a thick lungful of his smoke. “Only way we could identify ‘em is through tattoos on the limbs we found.”

“Who were they?” Ridley asked. 

“Don’t I know you?” Izla said.

“Could be. I’m sure we have fond memories. So, who were they?”

“Far as we can make out, they’re lads from down Eversham Hill, might be associated with The Landlord and his mob,” Fisher replied.

“All Human males in their late teens and early twenties,” Izla added.

“Possible motive?” Nairo asked.

“We ain't even sure of the method yet, sweetheart, but you could guess,” Fisher said.

“You could guess,” Izla agreed. 

“So, could you?”

“Guess?”

“Yes.”

“Well word is one of Chaw’drak’s captains got mopped up a couple days ago and this is the get back,” Fisher said.

“Any evidence to support that?” Ridley said.

“Wouldn't be a guess if there was.”

“Benny?” Nairo directed her question to Ridley who nodded. “Can we see?”

“Sure,” Izla said with a shrug.

“Watch your step,” Fisher advised. “There’s… bits of ‘em everywhere.” 

Nairo thanked the detectives and they walked into the alley. 

As soon as she stepped into the alley she felt a damp chill claw across her spine. Nairo heard Ridley curse as his eyes adjusted to the gloom. There was blood everywhere. The walls were coated in streaks of crimson red. The still congealing plasma oozed from the brickwork giving Nairo nightmarish visions of the almost dismembered Benny. Her balance left her for a moment only for Ridley to grab hold of her and prop her up. She could feel the tremor in his hands and the thump of his heart. Nairo tore her eyes from the blood covered walls to the puddle of undefinable Human internals pooled in the crevices of the grimy alley. Dotted around were little white scraps of cloth covering, what Nairo assumed, were the dismembered limbs of the victims. Nairo felt her breath catch in her throat, she was horrified but could not stop her eyes from taking in every ounce of gore. Her eyes fixated on a little round ball with a tendon hanging from it. A human eye stared unblinking at her. Some deep instinctual urge pulled at her making her want to flee from the alley as fast as possible but her legs carried her deeper into the hellish scene.

“This look familiar?” Ridley whispered

Nairo couldn't speak. She simply nodded, her eyes stinging.

As she forced herself to calm, she looked past the gore to the deep scorch marks across the walls of the alley. Whatever had killed them had left angry claw marks in the brickwork. That familiar smell of pennies invaded her nostrils and cloyed in the back of her throat. The scale of the damage became more apparent as they walked towards the epicentre of the blast. Cobbles had been torn up and turned to rubble. There was about a four metre radius of scorch marks that looked like a sudden wildfire erupted in the alley. They came to a stop at the epicentre of the blast. There was a crater shaped hole in the alley, the fire had burned so hot here the cobbles had melted and the brickwork was cracked and warped.

“This has to be the Diamond,” Ridley said. “What happens next time it goes off?”

Nairo, who had been transfixed upon the melted cobbles, looked up at Ridley, her eyes wet. They had been told what the Diamond could do, but to see it sent shivers through her. 

“I need to get out of here,” Nairo said, striding past him, her eyes fixed on the mouth of the alley. 

Ridley hung about a few seconds longer before he was hot on her heels. They were almost at a run by the time they exited the mouth of the alley. Nairo sucked in the fresh air while Ridley spat the taste of copper out of his mouth.

“Here,” Izla held two hot coffees out to them. 

“Ain’t right, is it?” Izla said. 

“Something evil happened in there,” Fisher said.

“What gave it away? The dismemberment?” Ridley’s voice lacked his usual bite. 

Nairo sipped distractedly at the coffee she had been offered, glad to feel the warmth return back to her. 

“What could have done that?” Izla pondered.

“Nothing that I’ve ever seen in twenty years on the job.” Fisher offered to light Ridley’s smoke as the PI’s trembling hands struggled to keep the flame of his lighter lit. 

“Any witnesses?” Ridley asked, shaking the numbness from his fingertips.

“Plenty,” Fisher said. “That factory across the road was full.”

“Shame they speak half a dozen languages and none of em ours,” Izla said. “Far as we can make out there was a big flash and a loud bang.”

“Some sort of explosion,” Fisher said.

“Great deduction,” Ridley muttered.

“No others?” Nairo asked.

“Well, we found a nasty little thing skulking about,” Fisher replied.

“Stank like rotten fish,” Izla added. “He was babbling ‘bout losing something when we found him, so we slung in the back of the wagon.”

Nairo noticed Ridley perked up like a hound.

“We’ll hose him down and take him back to the station.”

“Little nasty fella dripping in bin juice?” Ridley said. 

“Friend of yours?” Izla asked incredulously.

“You could say that. His name is Ozwald and he’s a bin demon” Nairo explained.

“He’s harmless,” Ridley said. 

“Well he was hanging around an adjacent alley…”

“With a lot of trash in it?”

“The usual amount I suppose.”

“He’s a bin demon, where do you expect him to be?”

Izla looked at Fisher who gave a noncommittal shrug.

“We questioned him and got a statement. Fat lot of good that was…”

“Wasn’t worth smelling him for,” Izla agreed.

“Can we speak to him?” Nairo asked. 

“Sure. Feel free to discharge him on your way out Sergeant,” Fisher said. 

“Right. Come on Ridley.” Nairo pushed Ridley in the small of the back and thanked the two detectives as they exited.

“Do you have to antagonise every police officer we meet?” 

“I don't have to…” Ridley said with a smirk. 

The coffee, and whatever he had poured into it, had begun to drive away the deathly chills of the alley.

“Hello,” Nairo greeted the officer standing outside the wagon. “Detectives Isla and Fisher have asked us to discharge their captive, Mr. Oz”

“Who?”

“The stinky little puddle of ooze in the back of your wagon,” Ridley said.

“Thank heavens for that,” the officer said. “Gonna be washing for a week after trying to put the grubby little bastard in the back of the wagon.” He nodded at them and swiftly took his leave.

“Deep breath,” Ridley warned her as he yanked open the doors to the wagon. 

The smell thundered from the wagon like a cavalry charge, almost taking Nairo off her feet.

“Phwoar! Bloody hell Oz! Did you take a shit in here?” Ridley cried, gagging as he finished his sentence. 

“Mr. Oz?” Nairo called into the dimly lit wagon, her eyes watering, as she peered into the gloom. 

“They mustn't find him… How could I lose him…” 

“Mr Oz?” 

“Wah… who’s that? Bloody pigs come for another go?” The little ball of slime and rags leapt to his feet wagging his bony fists causing gunge to be sprayed around the wagon. 

“It’s us Mr Oz, Sergeant Nairo and Ridley.”

Oz stopped his cussing long enough to allow his eyes to adjust to the daylight. 

“Well stone me and call me a carp’s nanny!” Oz’s face brightened momentarily before a deeply suspicious scowl returned to it. “Wot d’yer want?”

“Real nice way to greet your rescuers,” Ridley said.

“Rescuers? I don’t need no rescuing… ‘specially by the likes of you!”

“Well, we’ll just leave you here then,” Ridley said and without missing a beat he began to close the wagon doors.

“Wait! Hold on! I didn’t mean it! Just a joke between mateys.” Oz scrambled to the mouth of the wagon and gave them what he must have thought was an endearing smile. Nairo felt her stomach churn: she could have sworn she saw something wriggle in his yellow toothed smile. Oz hopped out of the wagon before Ridley could change his mind. He flopped to the cobbles like a creature in prayer and kissed the grimy stones. Ridley pulled a face and lit another smoke. 

“Ummm… Mr Oz, what were you doing here?” Nairo asked. 

“Yeah, this ain’t your usual scene,” Ridley said.

“Oh… ermmmm… The lunch these foreigners in the factories throw out is delicious,” Oz replied.

“Lovely,” Ridley said. 

Oz gave him a weak smile and then seemed to hesitate, looking at Ridley curiously.

“Did you see what happened here?” Nairo asked. 

Oz hesitated again and then shook his head so hard an insect flicked out from somewhere. 

“Just heard a big bang, then all these coppers grabbed me up.”

“You didn’t see anyone running away or anything?” Ridley said. 

“No! And even if I did I ain’t no grass!” 

Nairo sighed and gave him a small smile. 

“You’re free to go Mr. Oz,” Nairo said.

Oz looked at her and then at Ridley almost as if he wanted to say more but then he changed his mind. 

“Corse I am,” he snapped at her. “I just want his ciggie.”

Ridley blew a cloud of smoke and offered him the remnants of his smoke. 

“You gotta chuck it on the floor.”

“What? Why?”

“Once any discarded item touches the street it’s considered trash. Demon laws say so.”

“Do they?” Ridley asked, looking at Nairo who shrugged nonplussed. “Fine.” 

Ridley tossed the cigarette butt on the floor. Oz leapt the second it hit the floor and licked it up from the cobbles. 

“So… what happened with the case you woz on? Benny an’ all that.” Oz asked as he happily chomped on the butt like chewing gum.

“Dead end,” Ridley answered. 

“Literally,” Nairo said.

“Wot d’yer mean?”

Ridley drew a finger across his throat and gave Oz a wicked grin.

“We found Benny murdered in his flat,” Nairo said. “Would you know anything about it Mr. Oz?”

“Me?” Oz blanched as he went a paler shade of urine yellow. “Why would I? Ain’t been near them Rat‘Oles in a cuppla weeks. I stays away from lowlifes like that!” 

“Bit rich coming from you, no?” 

“Wot d’yer mean by that!” Oz snapped, wagging a dripping fist at him. 

“Ignore him,” Nairo said. “You’re free to go Mr. Oz and if you do hear anything please be sure to contact us.”

“Yeah… right. Maybe.” Oz glowered darkly at Ridley.

“Have a good evening and…” Nairo’s eyes danced across the mouth of the grizzly alleyway. “Make sure wherever you rest your head tonight it’s safe.”

Oz followed her eyes and he turned an even sicklier shade. He nodded and without another word he scuttled back into the detritus of the city and vanished like a mouse in a hole. Nairo didn't notice him slither away as she was transfixed on the sight of white sheets draped over lumpen body parts being wheeled out by the coroners.

“Come on, I need a drink.” Ridley nudged her lightly on the arm. 

“Yeah.” 

She followed Ridley as he swept away leaving the horrors in the alley behind them. 

32

Nairo had often found the grizzlier the crime the more excited the scene was and this one had the electric buzz of a day at the races. Nairo and Ridley hopped out of the police cart after twenty minutes of nudging and fighting their way through the gelatinous after work traffic to find a thronging mass of factory workers forming a mob around the police lines. Nairo politely shoved her way through the crowd while Ridley chose the more democratic approach of shin kicking anyone who got in his way. The sweat and chatter of the excited workers cloyed at her, drowning her in a dozen exotic languages.

“Heard they got exploded…”

“Bits of ‘em be everywhere…”

“Blew a hole a building deep, nothing but a crater left…”

“Naa they got hacked up…”

“Rip to pieces…”

“Must have been Goblins…”

“Revenge…”

Nairo finally arrived, breathless and flustered, at the police lines. Several of the VPD’s heftiest stood arms wide, chests inflated, barking at the onlookers to ‘move on,’ as there was ‘nothing to see here.’

“Sergeant Nairo.” She flashed her badge and scooped her thick hair away from sweaty forehead. “And this is…” she looked around for Ridley and moments later she heard a commotion to her right. There was loud swearing and raised fists before a melee broke out. A few seconds later Ridley came tumbling out of the brawl. He brushed himself down, swore at a Dwarf, and then nodded to the officer and Nairo. 

“He’s with me.”

“Are you sure marm?”

Nairo paused for a moment. 

“Yes.”

Ridley smirked impudently at the officer as they ducked under the police line and walked towards the alley. The chaos of the excited crowd shrank away. The closer they walked to the scene the more it felt like the air was being sucked from their lungs. The electric energy of the chattering crowd dissipated into a mournful hush. There were more officers but these one looked ashen faced and they barely registered Nairo and Ridley’s presence. Nairo nodded at the first couple but she began to feel like a trespasser at a funeral and eventually she too had her eyes glued to the cobbles. As they approached the crime scene there were two detectives at the mouth of the alley sharing a smoke. 

“Afternoon, I’m  Sergeant Nairo.”

“Izla and this is Fisher,” Izla, the taller of the two, answered. 

Both of them had that weary, haunted, look of homicide detectives. Fisher was short and round with a ruddy face and tobacco stains on his teeth. 

“What’s it like in there?” 

“The worst one I’ve ever seen,” Izla said, running a hand through his thinning brown hair. 

“Bits and pieces everywhere,” Fisher added, sipping his cold coffee and taking a thick lungful of his smoke. “Only way we could identify ‘em is through tattoos on the limbs we found.”

“Who were they?” Ridley asked. 

“Don’t I know you?” Izla said.

“Could be. I’m sure we have fond memories. So, who were they?”

“Far as we can make out, they’re lads from down Eversham Hill, might be associated with The Landlord and his mob,” Fisher replied.

“All Human males in their late teens and early twenties,” Izla added.

“Possible motive?” Nairo asked.

“We ain't even sure of the method yet, sweetheart, but you could guess,” Fisher said.

“You could guess,” Izla agreed. 

“So, could you?”

“Guess?”

“Yes.”

“Well word is one of Chaw’drak’s captains got mopped up a couple days ago and this is the get back,” Fisher said.

“Any evidence to support that?” Ridley said.

“Wouldn't be a guess if there was.”

“Benny?” Nairo directed her question to Ridley who nodded. “Can we see?”

“Sure,” Izla said with a shrug.

“Watch your step,” Fisher advised. “There’s… bits of ‘em everywhere.” 

Nairo thanked the detectives and they walked into the alley. 

As soon as she stepped into the alley she felt a damp chill claw across her spine. Nairo heard Ridley curse as his eyes adjusted to the gloom. There was blood everywhere. The walls were coated in streaks of crimson red. The still congealing plasma oozed from the brickwork giving Nairo nightmarish visions of the almost dismembered Benny. Her balance left her for a moment only for Ridley to grab hold of her and prop her up. She could feel the tremor in his hands and the thump of his heart. Nairo tore her eyes from the blood covered walls to the puddle of undefinable Human internals pooled in the crevices of the grimy alley. Dotted around were little white scraps of cloth covering, what Nairo assumed, were the dismembered limbs of the victims. Nairo felt her breath catch in her throat, she was horrified but could not stop her eyes from taking in every ounce of gore. Her eyes fixated on a little round ball with a tendon hanging from it. A human eye stared unblinking at her. Some deep instinctual urge pulled at her making her want to flee from the alley as fast as possible but her legs carried her deeper into the hellish scene.

“This look familiar?” Ridley whispered

Nairo couldn't speak. She simply nodded, her eyes stinging.

As she forced herself to calm, she looked past the gore to the deep scorch marks across the walls of the alley. Whatever had killed them had left angry claw marks in the brickwork. That familiar smell of pennies invaded her nostrils and cloyed in the back of her throat. The scale of the damage became more apparent as they walked towards the epicentre of the blast. Cobbles had been torn up and turned to rubble. There was about a four metre radius of scorch marks that looked like a sudden wildfire erupted in the alley. They came to a stop at the epicentre of the blast. There was a crater shaped hole in the alley, the fire had burned so hot here the cobbles had melted and the brickwork was cracked and warped.

“This has to be the Diamond,” Ridley said. “What happens next time it goes off?”

Nairo, who had been transfixed upon the melted cobbles, looked up at Ridley, her eyes wet. They had been told what the Diamond could do, but to see it sent shivers through her. 

“I need to get out of here,” Nairo said, striding past him, her eyes fixed on the mouth of the alley. 

Ridley hung about a few seconds longer before he was hot on her heels. They were almost at a run by the time they exited the mouth of the alley. Nairo sucked in the fresh air while Ridley spat the taste of copper out of his mouth.

“Here,” Izla held two hot coffees out to them. 

“Ain’t right, is it?” Izla said. 

“Something evil happened in there,” Fisher said.

“What gave it away? The dismemberment?” Ridley’s voice lacked his usual bite. 

Nairo sipped distractedly at the coffee she had been offered, glad to feel the warmth return back to her. 

“What could have done that?” Izla pondered.

“Nothing that I’ve ever seen in twenty years on the job.” Fisher offered to light Ridley’s smoke as the PI’s trembling hands struggled to keep the flame of his lighter lit. 

“Any witnesses?” Ridley asked, shaking the numbness from his fingertips.

“Plenty,” Fisher said. “That factory across the road was full.”

“Shame they speak half a dozen languages and none of em ours,” Izla said. “Far as we can make out there was a big flash and a loud bang.”

“Some sort of explosion,” Fisher said.

“Great deduction,” Ridley muttered.

“No others?” Nairo asked.

“Well, we found a nasty little thing skulking about,” Fisher replied.

“Stank like rotten fish,” Izla added. “He was babbling ‘bout losing something when we found him, so we slung in the back of the wagon.”

Nairo noticed Ridley perked up like a hound.

“We’ll hose him down and take him back to the station.”

“Little nasty fella dripping in bin juice?” Ridley said. 

“Friend of yours?” Izla asked incredulously.

“You could say that. His name is Ozwald and he’s a bin demon” Nairo explained.

“He’s harmless,” Ridley said. 

“Well he was hanging around an adjacent alley…”

“With a lot of trash in it?”

“The usual amount I suppose.”

“He’s a bin demon, where do you expect him to be?”

Izla looked at Fisher who gave a noncommittal shrug.

“We questioned him and got a statement. Fat lot of good that was…”

“Wasn’t worth smelling him for,” Izla agreed.

“Can we speak to him?” Nairo asked. 

“Sure. Feel free to discharge him on your way out Sergeant,” Fisher said. 

“Right. Come on Ridley.” Nairo pushed Ridley in the small of the back and thanked the two detectives as they exited.

“Do you have to antagonise every police officer we meet?” 

“I don't have to…” Ridley said with a smirk. 

The coffee, and whatever he had poured into it, had begun to drive away the deathly chills of the alley.

“Hello,” Nairo greeted the officer standing outside the wagon. “Detectives Isla and Fisher have asked us to discharge their captive, Mr. Oz”

“Who?”

“The stinky little puddle of ooze in the back of your wagon,” Ridley said.

“Thank heavens for that,” the officer said. “Gonna be washing for a week after trying to put the grubby little bastard in the back of the wagon.” He nodded at them and swiftly took his leave.

I cannot access the responses unfortunately because the app wont let me i get the message ""take a coffee break""...
but for context they have been replying with generic responses asking things like ""what error message are you receiving"" and ""transactions have 0.5% fees"" and other generic responses.  I replied to them again today on the same support ticket and said ""please please read my original issue l, look at the screenshots and watch the screen recording i have sent you"".

5 minutes later they responded but before i had a chance to read their response i got the error message (see images).

This looks like a rate limit message but it also says something about security. I don't buy either of those reasons, i honestly think the support person just blocked me.

What if they block my finances? I have recently switched everything to bunq. I am paying 20EUR/month for me.and my partner to joint our finances, i have joint accounts, cards, personal accounts, savings accounts, scheduled payments, everything is set up.

To combat this, I was drinking LMNT throughout the day. And of course some decaf with stevia (100% organic and raw) in the morning. 

I noticed the only time it got better was when I traveled. A few weeks ago it dawned on me…. I drink a pretty substantial amount of stevia throughout the day… coffee & LMNT. 

Cut out stevia for a few days and ZERO diarrhea. To test the waters, I had a sprinkle in my coffee this morning & was headed to the bathroom within minutes. 

I’m going to continue experimenting…. But I literally think a HUGE part of the problems I’ve had are due to some kind of stevia intolerance.

I get a call from a friend that overlooks/maintains the supercars in the garage that I had a flat.  I ask him, is it a flat or a “flat, flat”

He said “flat, flat”….. I thank him, get out of bed, grab a coffee and think, if typically call AAA but not sure if that is the protocol for a Ferrari parked in a parking garage 5 flights up.

So I call the dealer and they sent someone out here.  This guy showed up with another Ferrari in tow and he was such a pro.

We went to the 5th floor and I hit a roofing nail…. could have been worse with all the “force majeure” in FL.

He goes to my trunk, where there was a tire (tyre) pump…. I had no idea it existed (I’m an amateur) and inflated the tire.

He drove it down and slide it into the trailer.  It was smooth…but I never been in that situation, so when in doubt I typically call them.  I’m sure it’s going to be a nice bill… and pretty sure I can’t buy 1 tire at a time but whatever.

My wife rushed me to the emergency (Houston Methodist the Woodlands) last Saturday night.  After an immediate CAT scan I got diagnosed with an inflamed gallbladder which had a large stone in it. Confirmed by ultrasound. They admitted me and I was moved to a room. They did an MRI on me to see if I had any stones in bile ducts but fortunately there weren’t any that showed up on the MRI. 

Surgery happened Sunday at 3:30pm. I woke up around an hour later. And was back in my room around 5:30pm. Had to stay in the hospital till Tuesday because of elevated liver enzymes and blood pressure. Post surgery pain levels never above a 5 (maybe) during the first hours. 

They prescribed me NORCO for 7 days but I haven’t taken any painkillers since the first night  back home (Tuesday)before going to bed (the only reason I did was because I figured the norco would knock me out while going to bed early). They also prescribed me antibiotics for a week but I had already been loaded up through iv during my time in the hospital, so I decided to stop taking those after 2 days. No pain (just some wound discomfort) , fever, anything. 

Thursday night (4 days post op). Had wings, a couple of beers and then red wine. No issues. Friday morning after coffee and a light, low fat breakfast I started having some serious diarrhea. Consulted a doctor friend and he told me that if I had no gut pain and/or fever I could take Imodium. This stopped it. Last night (Friday night) the family wants to order Panda Express. I at some of that and again had red wine.  

Now, Saturday morning, I just had some coffee.  And it seems I’m doing fine. I am thinking of eating some scrambled eggs for breakfast. 

Throughout the experience I’ve stayed extremely hydrated(close to 2 gallons of water a day) and made sure I moved around a lot (hourly walks in the hospital)

Qualities that are important to me? Hmm, loyalty, consistency; open, honest communication; the ability to make me laugh (hard and often, preferably); patience, kindness, and a genuine desire to learn who I am as a person.

Being self-aware, compassionate, and empathetic are also super important and attractive qualities to me. I try to be kind to everyone I meet. With that said, I was voted most likely to say, ""I wish you the best,"" knowing damn well I hope you go to hell. Life's about balance, not perfection ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

I think I'm best described as an extroverted introvert - I do really well in social settings, but more often than not, I'd prefer just being home in my own space. With that said, I'm always down to travel, checkout new restaurants, museums, aquariums, the zoo, farmers markets, book stores, quaint coffee shops, and the likes. In my free time, if I'm not working out, hanging out with my dogs/friends/family, I love being of service to others and find fulfilment in volunteering. 

I'm 34. Female. 5'6ish. Curvy, dark features, tanned skin. Educated. Knows which utensil to use for which food (humble brag). Mentally sane. Single; no human kids - just a fur mom to my two doggos that make my heart beam with pride and who give my life so. much. meaning. 

You are: preferably my age or older, single, child free, monogamous, and text with purpose. I don’t care what you look like or what you do for a living, just be yourself, and we'll be good. 

It'd be a bonus if we're in the same timezone (eastern), but it's not an issue if we aren't. For what it's worth, I'm based on the East Coast but open to friendship and connections from anywhere in the world.  

Thanks for taking the time to read this. If anything in this post resonates with you, feel free to reach out. I look forward to the banter :)

What I’m Looking For: I’m looking beta readers to give feedback on the first draft of my novel. I’m specifically looking for feedback on the overall plot, character development, pacing, and consistency. 

Blurb: Addie never expected her summer job at Black Ink Coffee to come with strings attached. Hired as a barista after her first year of college, she’s just trying to support herself through school to create a better future. Then she meets Pierce—the tattooed, mysterious owner who’s made it clear that he doesn’t get involved with his staff. But the undeniable attraction between them soon proves impossible to resist, and they dive into what they think is a summer fling. 

When Addie discovers she’s pregnant, their carefree arrangement turns into something much more complicated. As Pierce wrestles with the demons of his high-society family, Addie must confront the grief of losing her mother, a wound that’s never fully healed. 

With both of their worlds unraveling, Addie and Pierce are forced to face their fears and decide if they can build a life together—or if their broken pasts will keep them apart for good. 

Excerpt: “I’ve never felt that way about anyone,” I admit quietly. That’s why this is so difficult. What I feel for Pierce isn’t like the friendship I have with Emily. It’s deeper, more intense, and it scares me. It’s new and unfamiliar territory, and I don’t know how to navigate it.

As the truck rumbles down Main Street, I watch the sleepy little town pass by. The shops and restaurants are all dark, their lights out for the night. The only illumination comes from the street lamps, casting a warm glow through the sunroof. It’s peaceful.

When Pierce turns down a side street and pulls into the parking lot behind Black Ink, I’m caught off guard. “It’s a bit early for my shift, don’t you think?” I joke, trying to lighten the mood, but there’s a tension in the air that wasn’t there before. Pierce’s hands grip the steering wheel so tightly that the veins in his forearms are visible, and his jaw is clenched in a way that makes my heart skip a beat.

I unbuckle my seatbelt and turn to face him; concern etched on my face. “What’s wrong?”
He sighs deeply, closing his eyes and pressing his forehead against the steering wheel. “You’ve never felt this way about anyone?” he asks, repeating my earlier words. I shake my head, my hands fidgeting nervously in my lap.

“Not really,” I say softly, my voice barely above a whisper.

Pierce takes a deep breath, then turns his head to look at me, his hazel eyes dark in the dim light. His gaze is intense, piercing through me in a way that makes me blush. I can tell he’s wrestling with something, his expression a mixture of frustration and something else I can’t quite place.

“You okay?” I ask, sliding closer to him in the space between us. I place my hand on his thigh, hoping to offer some comfort. His gaze drops to my hand, and he takes his hand off the steering wheel, placing it on top of mine. His fingers wrap around mine, his thumb gently stroking the top, sending a shiver down my spine. I should pull my hand away, but I don’t. 

The air in the truck is thick with tension, but it’s different now. It’s no longer the uncomfortable tension of unspoken words and unresolved feelings. It’s something else, something electric, something that feels like it could change everything in an instant. 

He squeezes my hand, his touch both firm and reassuring, before sitting up. His gaze locks onto mine, a mixture of determination and desire flickering in his eyes. 

“Fuck my stupid rules,” he mutters with a low growl, his voice thick with frustration. Before my mind can fully process his words, I feel his lips crashing against mine with a fierce, consuming urgency.

I instinctively wrap my arms around his neck, pulling him closer as our bodies intertwine. This kiss is a world away from the tentative, exploratory one we shared the other night. It’s no longer gentle and restrained; it’s raw and hungry, filled with all the tension that’s been building between us. I moan deeply into his mouth as his teeth nip at my lower lip, tugging it just enough to heighten the intensity before he deepens the kiss.

Content wanting: This is a spicy contemporary romance with full sex scenes and pregnancy will play a roll. No birth scene. 

Timeline: No strict timeline

Sometimes she's on time, sometimes she's just 5-10 minutes late, sometimes she cancels our usual gym meeting or study plans. I know she has ADHD and struggles with time blindness, so I try really hard to not be upset, but it's frustrating. She's a close friend I really enjoy spending time with and I don't see that changing. 

I *know* she's not doing it on purpose or maliciously. I know she's not doing it to be disrespectful of my time or because she thinks her time & habits are more important or just doesn't think I matter enough to be on time for, because I know her and that's just not how she thinks at all. But that's still how it feels. I'm no stranger to running late sometimes. When I run late, which I do fairly regularly, I make sacrifices and cut things out of my morning--things I really wanted to do--to be on time. Knowing that I sacrifice sleep and coffee and things I want to do in order to be on time makes it hurt a little when other people refuse to do that. 

What strategies do you or your loved ones use to feel okay with lack of punctuality? I know there are genuinely no bad intentions and I'm trying to accept it, but I feel a little hurt every time. I know she's not going to change, but what can I do to chill out a little and not react that way? ",2,1728135381.0,ADHD,2,1.0,False

1fwqiaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/ContestOfChampions/comments/1fwqiaw/realm_events_will_continue_to_flop_if_kabam/,Realm Events will continue to flop if Kabam doesn't change the incentives,"Good morning everyone, welcome to Saturday Times of Fun Updates with LB, where I drink coffee and type furiously on my phone about a mobile video game to avoid interacting with the real world. Today's topic is the Realm Event and its shortfalls.        

Realm Events are a good idea in theory, but have significant design problems. Although the Crystal Cleansing was just a test run of the technology, we came nowhere near earning all the milestones. Jack's Battleground Blitz began a few days ago, but already the community is behind the necessary pace to achieve all milestones. I assume the goal for Realm Events is to have the community share a common goal that it, more often than not, achieves. Although there's time to change, so far we are falling short in both events.                

Not achieving all milestones is bad for a few reasons. First the community fails to earn those rewards, duh. More importantly, it generates resentment. People who take time to earn a lot of points feel let down by others who did not contribute as much. And vice versa, those who don't do as much get irritated they are being harangued by ""tryhards"" to contribute more. Those resentments lead to general negativity, which creates an us v. them mentality and overall ill will against our fellow summoners. Finally, missing milestones leads to decreased motivation of those people at the top. The players who worked hard on one event have less desire to do it the next time, because their efforts didn't pay off when the community ""let them down"" (even if that's not what happened, it's all about feelings and perception). One failure generates a cascading effect that hurts future Realm Events.            

Why don't we achieve milestones? I think individual incentives aren't strong enough to motivate people to go above the minimums. Rank rewards in these events are paltry. There are some miniscule shards for some players in Jack's event. The only cool award in Crystal Cleansing is Bastion, for literally one person. I have some personal experience in this area because for Crystal Cleansing I opened 70,000 crystals (I was shooting for Bastion but at least one person is more psychotic than me and has opened 100k). I won't get anything special for my efforts, nor will someone like Brian Grant, who streamed opening 50,000 crystals over 5 hours. Jack's Realm Event is no better, there are way too few valuable rank rewards overall compared to how many people need to contribute to earn the milestones.    

The lack of valuable rank rewards has two effects. One, it leaves a sour taste in the mouths of players who go above and beyond for the community, because they don't gain additional benefits for trying to help everyone else out. Two, it disincentivizes other would-be tryhards who might consider going above and beyond in the future. They see the rank rewards, realize they are unlikely to gain anything meaningful, so they never contribute in the first place despite having the resources to do so.       

You might see where I'm going with this. **Realm Events can be fixed by expanding the pool of valuable ranked rewards.** Don't make the cool stuff so exclusive that only 1 or 10 people get it. The common player will see that and know they won't be in the top ten. But could they make the top 10,000? I mean, maybe! Even if it's only cosmetic, give 100 or 1000 people the exclusive title or profile pic. The key is to give enough that people say, ""Hey that's achievable, I am going to try for it!"" It's about aligning personal incentives with those of the community as a whole.        

If Kabam does that, everyone benefits because more people will participate, more people feel recognized (which is different than actually being rewarded), and the community generates positive feelings about something we all accomplished.     

Realm Events are a cool concept. The Necropolis death counter was really, really fun. Kabam shouldn't abandon the idea, but they need to fix it. If they don't, it's only going to generate negative feelings in the community, which isn't good for anyone.",1,1728135186.0,ContestOfChampions,7,0.57,False

A couple weeks ago a headhunter contacted me about a different role at a Series B startup. I had ZERO interest in moving, but I’m a big believer in keeping my interviewing muscles sharp and expanding my network, so I took the first call just to meet the guy. I made it very clear I wasn’t looking to move, but he suggested I coffee chat the CEO of this business.

Long story short, I’ve landed an offer. My title would go from Sr. Associate at <Blue Chip Tech> making $115K to Ops Lead at <Relatively Unknown Startup> making $150k + equity. I really don’t want to move, but is this too much money and too big an opportunity to turn down?

1fwqhur,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1fwqhur/tired_drained_m31/,"Tired, drained. M31","
After I felt that I was over the pain of a long-term relationship coming to an end, I decided it was time to start talking to women again. My ex was able to get different guys any night of the week and bring them home (after we broke up and still living together, it was horrible; I blew up on on one of them). I discovered that dating, or attempting to date as an adult is so incredibly challenging. 

It was probably easier to date in high school, being around hundreds of people around my age. Now that I'm in my 30's I'm never in a building with that many people, let alone in my age group, but I have been giving it a valiant effort regardless of this handicap. 

I've tried a handful of dating apps. I was excited to see what they were like. They got popular in the middle of my serious relationship so I never tried them out. Sometimes I'd match and chat with people, but ultimately, those apps were a tease that made it much more clear on women I can see but never have a relationship with. 

So I tried other methods. I asked this girl out that I used to work with that I thought was cute. I asked if she wanted to go to grab a bite sometime. She said she would go out to eat as friends but she didn't want to date... thanks but I wanna spoil you and compliment you and hold hands walking by the river after dinner is what I thought to myself. 

So I tried IRL approaches since aaking people out on my phone was making me depressed. I knew this waitress for quite a while and always thought she was pretty. I went in to her restaurant toward closing when she wasn't busy and asked if she wanted to get some drinks. She said no she couldn't, that was really sweet though! 

I gave up for a while and just did my own thing. Read and walked a lot. 

I got to know this barista at a coffee shop over the next few months. At first I just figured she was being nice and doing her job. But when she would say my name everytime I walked in and twiddle her fingers at me and say bye and my name everytime I left and giggle and blush at my stupid jokes, I thought we were flirting. Three months go by and I'm convinced that we really like each other. One evening I go in and ask her if she would ever wanna hang out sometime. Her face slowly morphs from jubilant to pity. ""I'm sorry... I'm, gonna... I'm gonna have to say no. Because I'm seeing someone.""  
""I understand. I still think you're awesome."" 
""You too,"" she said. And I never went back there again. My ex was able to get numerous guys instantly after we broke up. Why can't I find one girl to hangout with a year later? 

At this point I've been single for over two years and I want to roll up into a ball and explode. I appreciate when people say I'm handsome or intelligent and any women would be lucky to be with me... but I feel like those are just empty words. If they were true I would have someone to walk by the river with and share my ideas and dreams with and I would listen to theres, as a matter of fact I would love to hear my crushes dreams.

I’m fluent in German / English / French and Spanish an can order drinks in a few more languages.

I am a tolerant, open minded person, even though politically not on the left but rather on the liberal side of things. I believe everybody should be able to live their lives however they want but am not compatible for open relationships / poly situationships or other non monogamous relationships…

As for looks, I would consider myself a little above average, not chubby even though I am currently working on getting back in shape and loosing a few extra pounds.

So I made a post a few days ago about going to a county jail for 24 hours asking for advice. I hate to say but it was kind of a blast. So I figured I'd update you guys about how it went.

My sentence was reckless driving going 96 in a 65. Was technically sentenced to 10 days with 9 of those days suspended. I do not live in VA, I live in NC so I was not familiar with VA law or the jail system. 

So I did my time I was told to bring all white so I did. I had white sweatpants which they made me take off but that was it and I was given a green jump suit

The officer/warden there was actually pretty nice. They gave me what they called the ""penthouse"". Basically a cell all to myself with my own private toilet and a TV all to myself. I guess the guy liked me because he said they don't give that to ""just anybody"". He also told me ""we all speed you just got caught"" which was a nice thing to hear. 

They didn't offer books nor did they let me bring my own, but on one of the bunks there was an old discarded book which I read some of but it wasn't very good tbh. 

I took sleeping medicine and that allowed me to sleep for about 2 hours and then figured that it was not convenient. So I did some exercises  like pushups, situps, squats and whatever

They gave me two blankets, some sheets and oral hygiene stuff. They didn't have me shower which was fine because I showered before going and I was let out around 7 am so I showered at home. Didn't even do the full 24 hours. 

They gave me breakfast some waffles, coffee, and milk. They were fine. 

They didn't shut off the lights until after midnight so I used a small rag as an eye cover but when I woke up the lights were super dim

it breaks my heart asking people for their hardearned money and i am ashamed. but i do not see any other way than this while i still look for a job. 

i apologize about this. i just really dont want to end up homeless. thank you. ",0,1728134381.0,PaypalDonations,0,0.5,False

1fwq79d,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatShouldIDo/comments/1fwq79d/brownnoser_at_work_edited/,Brown-Noser at work (edited),"I work in a biotech startup and we recently got a new lab technician on the team, who just got their BS last year.  The new tech was easy to get along with in the beginning and I enjoyed getting to know them, despite being an introvert and having a depressing summer (dealing with 2 recent deaths from cancer).  Once the tech got into the role, I was noticing early signs: parroting what the lab manager says and their mannerisms and sucking up to both the CSO and our boss.  The new tech also pestered me when I needed to do the weekly bio safety hood cleanups (everyone has to do this and the lab manager made a schedule for us to rotate each week to keep it fair).  I was halfway done and the tech kept asking me if I needed help.  The first time was fine but after multiple times, I said, “I appreciate you offering but this is my responsibility.  Everyone has to do this and I’m literally almost done.  Plus we had a busy day.”  The tech responded, “Fine, I’ll just sit at my desk and do nothing!”  I was like, “Okay.”  Like were they trying to make me feel guilty for saying no?  The lab tech also have petty arguments with the lab manager to the point where I found them to be both annoying.  After going over the results of some experiment with the CSO, the new tech threw out, “By the way, I made all these reagents for you!” (In the tone of, “I made it for you, you lazy bum…”) and the CSO was like, “Oh, um thank you.”😳For the boss, the boss needed to do a group discussion with me, the new tech, and my team.  We get certain organs from deceased donors to harvest cells for research purposes and the boss was stressing about the idea of us having to harvest this weekend.  The lab manager was going to be out for an obligation, hence unavailable for the weekend.  The new tech said, “My roommate wanted to go to this college football game and I was waiting until last minute to buy tickets in case we got an organ so if we got an organ, I was going to help with that instead of going to the game.”  I was sitting at the opposite side of the room at my desk (they couldn’t see me behind my monitor), but I rolled my eyes… my boss is very understanding if we had plans.  The boss told me numerous times that I’m free to have plans and to take vacation days (I’ve been known to never take days off unless I needed to).  I know the new tech had good intentions (as far as I’m aware), but they seemed to look like they’re trying really hard to say the right things… to suck up.  Case in point, the tech then said, “I really hope we get an organ this week and next week.”  The thing is, we rely solely on when the donor dies as well as if there are any damages that might jeopardise with harvesting… every case is a surprise for us.  As we were closing off the meeting, the new tech said to the boss, “I’ll be available so you can just call me.”  The boss said, “I actually prefer to keep it as a group message to confirm everyone’s availability and if anything happens, we would at least know and work on how we could cover each other…” as if the boss seemed to pick up that the new tech was sucking up.  I know it’s best to ignore them and to focus on myself, but the tech is on my team (I have 5 years of professional lab experience plus 1 year in undergrad while the new tech has 1 year and like I said, just graduated last year… the boss told me that the tech isn’t going to replace me at all and the boss does their best to cherish every member of the lab) and we share spaces… we both mainly share a room as our office space.  When it gets too annoying for me (I have low tolerance for that and for bs), I stick my ear buds in to drown out the noise and to focus on my work.

Edit 1: Nothing like waking up at 4am on Saturday to a group text from that new tech, saying, “Good morning!  See you guys soon.”  There was an organ case that day and I was unable to go due to travelling for a friend’s wedding that I attended that afternoon.  I just find that to be rude and obnoxious of them.

Edit 2: Now that new tech complains about everything… being tired all the time (they’re overweight for their height after dealing with COVID-19), being sore (whether or not they went to the gym the night before), and various things with the lab manager (doing tasks for the lab manager or doing SOPs… what this new tech was literally hired to do).  I know to stay quiet during this or tune it out with my music and I tried to resolve this by saying things like, “Why don’t you stretch your legs out for a bit after all this sitting?  Maybe it’ll help… How about some coffee to do the trick?  We have plenty of K cups…”, but there were times when I was ready to say, “Shut up!  Quit whining!  This is what you were hired to do… if you don’t like it, either you talk to your boss or leave!”  I know to keep quiet about this, but this is among the many times I find them to be annoying.  I know I can’t do anything to control it but like I said, we share the same spaces everyday and it’s becoming a distraction to me.  

The funny thing is, my boss noticed how much I’ve kept my distance (even though I still like my boss and I’m just trying to focus on getting my work done… focus more on myself and our cases… I think those few things are more important than drama).",1,1728134273.0,WhatShouldIDo,0,1.0,False

1fwq70i,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingsmoking/comments/1fwq70i/quitting_smoking_makes_me_feel_like_im_dying/,Quitting smoking makes me feel like I'm dying,"I started smoking at the age of 17, ten years ago, and soon progressed to a pack a day. On more stressful days or when drinking, I would smoke even more.  On the 30th of August, something broke inside me after six cups of coffee, including a double espresso, and 20 cigarettes. Since then, I have been gradually reducing the amount of cigarettes I smoke, while feeling increasingly ill after each cigarette. Since the 2nd of October, I've almost quit: I smoked my last full cigarette that evening and started having a panic attack, which I calmed with a benzodiazepine. The following day, I smoked half a cigarette in the afternoon, and the day after that, a few puffs in the morning. I have also almost quit coffee (down to two sips a day versus six cups).

I thought I would feel better, but I actually feel much worse. I basically feel like I'm on my deathbed. I no longer feel ill and poisoned, but I'm anxious, miserable, disoriented, and almost experiencing derealization. I also feel brain-damaged. Physically, I feel like I'm being executed by *peine forte et dure*, whereas I expected my breathing and chest pain to improve. The fact that my nasal passages are obstructed by turbinate hypertrophy and a bad case of a deviated septum makes it worse.

I had severe muscle fasciculations and some myoclonus, which are now subsiding. However, I feel like my brain has been partly shut off and like it takes active effort to just use my senses. It seems like reality is a very bad nightmare. I can barely get up to use the bathroom. Benzodiazepines don't help. They only helped with the anxiety attacks caused by coffee and cigarettes.

It also seems like my heart has lost its pacemaker. It suddenly starts racing and then slows down while I'm falling asleep.

My sleep is also ruined. I thought that nicotine prevents sleep and that cutting it out would therefore improve the quality of my sleep, but I now wake up in agony every hour, in a cold sweat with nausea.

I would have tapered the tobacco more gradually if the sudden-onset panic attacks hadn't been that bad. It's almost like I had a stimulant-induced nervous breakdown which forced me to quit cold-turkey.

I am also surprised that I don't feel nicotine cravings. I don't feel irritable. I'm not coughing up phlegm. I just feel extremely ill. I'm not struggling not to light a cigarette, I feel like I'm struggling to exist. Maybe I just have an illness which my body is struggling with and is therefore making me stop smoking so it can deal with it more effectively, without the added burden of stimulants. Yet, all my blood work is normal.",1,1728134251.0,quittingsmoking,6,1.0,False

Inspired by the classic ""Compiling"" XKCD comic (https://3d.xkcd.com/303/), I’ve built CodeAir (codeair.app) – an Android app and VS Code extension that turns your phone into a remote control for VS Code.

With CodeAir, you can:

* Control 800+ VS Code commands right from your phone.
* Send text and image files directly into your workspace and even have the images transcribed using AI. So imagine taking a snapshot of a piece of code from a physical textbook and being directly able to run that inside VS Code.
* Request screenshots from VS Code while AFK and get them delivered to your phone so you can monitor long builds or processes remotely when you're on a coffee break.
* If you’ve got an OpenAI API key, you can even perform QnA over your transferred files and images.

I made this tool to help monitor long builds or tests when I’m AFK, but it’s useful for so much more! It’s super niche, but I hope some of you find it helpful.

1fwpxwj,https://www.reddit.com/r/celebrityweightlose/comments/1fwpxwj/finding_my_way_under_the_stars_my_journey_with/,Finding My Way Under the Stars: My Journey with Moon Reading,"Hey Reddit, I wanted to share something personal that’s really transformed how I see myself and my life. It’s called Moon Reading, and before you roll your eyes thinking it’s just another astrology thing—trust me, I was skeptical at first too. But it’s been a game-changer for me. Let me tell you how it all began.

So, I’m Emma, a 30-year-old marketing professional living in Seattle. On the surface, life looked pretty good—nice job, friends, an apartment in a city I love—but inside, I felt this constant sense of unease. You know that feeling, like something’s missing, but you can’t quite put your finger on it? I was going through the motions, and despite being successful in my career, I felt disconnected from myself.

One night, after another exhausting day at work, I was doom-scrolling on Instagram when I stumbled across a post about Moon Reading. It promised to help people understand themselves on a deeper level by looking at their birth chart and the influence of the moon and planets on their life. I’d always been curious about astrology, but I never thought it could offer anything more than vague horoscopes. But that night, something about Moon Reading drew me in. I figured, why not? I had nothing to lose.

**What Is Moon Reading, Anyway?**

So, Moon Reading isn’t just your typical astrology stuff—it’s way more interactive. When you sign up, they create this 3D model of the solar system as it was at the exact moment you were born. You can actually visualize the positions of the planets and how they affect your personality, emotions, relationships—everything. It’s like a roadmap of your emotional landscape. I was intrigued, even if a bit skeptical.

[Moon Reading](https://preview.redd.it/ooiv1gkcrxsd1.png?width=1120&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d94d98190438ab610b86f0489f1573b16e3fe56)

When my first reading came through, I sat in my apartment with my laptop open, ready to watch my personalized video. I didn’t expect much, but as the astrologer walked through my chart, something clicked. Turns out, I’m a Pisces moon, which is all about deep emotions and sensitivity. The astrologer explained how that impacts the way I process feelings, especially in social situations. It was like someone had flipped a light switch on. I finally understood why I always felt so drained after being around people—my emotions were absorbing everyone else’s energy.

**Connecting the Dots of My Life**

I think the moment that hit me the hardest was when I realized how much I’d been ignoring parts of myself. The reading talked about my creativity and how I’d been pushing it aside for years. I’d always loved painting but gave it up when life got busy, you know? But now, it made sense why I felt so disconnected. My creativity wasn’t just a hobby; it was a core part of who I am, and I’d been ignoring it for so long that it was affecting my happiness.

Inspired by what I’d learned, I signed up for a painting class at a local studio. That first night back at the easel, I felt alive in a way I hadn’t for years. It wasn’t just about the art itself, but about reclaiming a piece of myself that had been buried under the weight of daily life.

**Navigating Life by the Phases of the Moon**

One of the coolest parts of Moon Reading is how it helps you understand the impact of lunar cycles. I’d never thought about how the moon might affect my energy levels, but after a few months of tracking it, the connection became clear. When the moon is waxing (growing), I’ve learned it’s the perfect time to start new projects, so that’s when I throw myself into work or pick up a new hobby. When the moon’s waning, I take a step back, reflect, and figure out what’s not working anymore.

This simple awareness has changed how I approach everything—work, friendships, even my mental health. I’m less hard on myself when I’m feeling low-energy because I know there are natural ebbs and flows, and I’ve learned to ride them instead of fighting against them.

**A Deeper Understanding of My Relationships**

Moon Reading didn’t just help me understand myself—it also gave me new insights into my relationships. I tend to get emotionally attached pretty quickly, which can be overwhelming for both me and the people around me. The reading explained that my Pisces moon makes me extra sensitive, which can sometimes make me take things personally, even when they aren’t meant that way.

Armed with this knowledge, I started having more open conversations with my friends, especially with my best friend Mia. I remember sitting across from her at our favorite coffee shop, spilling all my newfound insights. It felt so liberating to finally understand why I acted the way I did. Mia looked at me and said, “This makes so much sense now. It’s like you’ve found your emotional roadmap.” And she was right. Knowing how my emotions worked helped me communicate better, and our friendship became even stronger.

**Tuning In to My Health**

One unexpected benefit of Moon Reading? It’s helped me connect the dots between the lunar cycles and my physical health. I used to have these random bouts of fatigue or emotional overwhelm, and I never knew why. Now, I pay attention to how I feel during different moon phases. For example, during the full moon, I’ve started journaling, which has been a great way to release pent-up emotions and clear my head.

By syncing my self-care routines with the moon’s phases, I’ve found more balance in my day-to-day life. I’m not saying the moon controls everything, but aligning my energy with its natural cycles has definitely brought me a sense of peace.

**The Universe in a New Light**

As time went on, I found myself feeling more connected to the universe. That might sound a little woo-woo, but hear me out. Moon Reading is interactive, so you’re not just passively receiving information—you’re encouraged to ask questions and explore your birth chart further. It’s like having a cosmic guide that helps you navigate life’s challenges.

I’ve realized that there’s so much more to life than the surface-level stuff we often get caught up in. We’re all part of something bigger, and Moon Reading helped me tap into that. It gave me clarity about my purpose and a renewed sense of direction.

**My Final Thoughts on Moon Reading**

Now, I’m not saying Moon Reading will solve all your problems, but it gave me the tools to understand myself in ways I never thought possible. If you’re feeling lost, like I was, or just curious about the deeper forces shaping your life, I highly recommend giving it a try. 

Whether you’re into astrology or not, Moon Reading offers a unique perspective on life. It’s not just about the stars or planets; it’s about understanding yourself on a deeper level and using that knowledge to make more informed decisions. It’s helped me rediscover my passion for art, navigate my relationships with more empathy, and find a new rhythm in my everyday life.

**So, if you’re looking for a way to reconnect with yourself, maybe give Moon Reading a shot. You might be surprised by what you find:** [**https:/moonreading.com/**](https://freezegluco.com/MoonReading.html)",4,1728133467.0,celebrityweightlose,0,1.0,False
1fwpxlk,https://www.reddit.com/r/diet/comments/1fwpxlk/is_this_what_normal_people_would_eat_in_a_day/,Is this what normal people would eat in a day?,"Hi all.

I (f28) ruined my sense for what „normal“ eating habits look like during my teenage years. 

Background:
I think it was due to women’s magazines, model shows,  anorexic best friends and my mother stopping to cook for me without ever having taught me how to do it myself (no blame on her, she has her own struggles including disordered eating).
I have never been happy with my weight and constantly wanted to lose 10kg, but over the years I gained 10kg. Meanwhile, I am a bit overweight (according to BMI) and very far away from looking the way I would feel comfortable with. 
Since my teenage years I tried all kinds of diets, went to the gym and so on. If at all, it only worked short-term. 

Goal:
I want to find a healthy way of eating that is sustainable for me. I want to eat like the naturally slim people who never in their life had to think about losing weight. Like those who learned the right habits from childhood on and never ruined them.

Question:
Do you think the following eating habits (which I think I could work towards implementing) would be what one would consider normal?

Breakfast: 
* 2 cups of coffee with oat milk
* porridge with berries or 1-2 bread rolls with butter and honey/marmelade

Lunch:
* a meal from my university cantine. I am vegetarian, so it would be the vegetarian option. 

Dinner:
* 2 bread rolls with cheese and tomatoes
* green salad or a soup
* tomato/carott juice 

Snacks:
* I would try to avoid it as much as possible (at least as long as I am still clearly overweight), but would not reject it at e.g. a social event.

1fwpxli,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1fwpxli/i_feel_like_a_failure/,I feel like a failure,"I'm 29 years old and I am feeling so lost, my self esteem is worse than ever.

My family raised me to be a very hard working person. I lived to get good grades so I could get in the best university. That was all the worth I felt like I had because It was all my parents focused on. It was the one thing I think I succeeded at. 

By the time I finished high school, I got in a very good Medicine University in a country nearby, but also got in the best Veterinary Medicine University in my country. I opted for Veterinary, animals were always a big big passion of mine. In my country, Veterinary Medicine is a degree of 6 years with a very high work load. 

What happened was that... It started to destroy me. By year 3 I was going through a lot of things at home (my parents had a very nasty divorce, my mom was very suicidal, my little sister needed proper care and even CPS got involved over complaints of neglect and abuse - Which were true. There was a lot of abuse in my house growing up.), not only that, I was struggling so hard to keep up with everything. The classes and studies were so demanding for someone who had a calm and peaceful life, imagine what they felt like for someone who had so much happening with their family. I would get home and all I could do was sleep. I couldnt even get the strenght to shower. My house was a mess. I would overeat and drink a lot of coffee so I could stay awake to study. I put on so much weight. I was so exausted I started hearing voices and seeing things which made sleep even harder. My health started to decline because of the excessive stress. I didn't look like the same person any more. I would sleep on the bathroom floor in university. I would cry just thinking how I would get home at the end of the day, I had to catch a bus, the subway and walk a fair amount of time. But I had to do it. My dad was playing for my housing, the moment I failed with my classes, I would stop having any financial support and would be on my own. 

Then... It came the day, my body couldnt handle it anymore. And I was extremelly suicidal. I eventually found a doctor that diagnosed me with autism. I tried asking for accomodations at college but unfortunately it didn't work. They said each teacher is free to choose if they want to ""give special treatment"" or not. By this time, year 4, I was so destroyed (I started drinking heavily, all kinds of self destruction behaviours hoping one would take me away from this world) I just... Quit. I stopped going.

And today, I know I can not go back, I wouldn't survive it. Just thinking about going back to a place where I suffered so much makes me panic.
But I miss feeling smart, if that makes sense. I miss being good at something. I feel like I lost all my habilities, all the life I had planned, all I ever fought for. My life was 100% focused on having a carreer. Not only that, MY WORTH was 100% focused on my academic success. And now I have nothing. I feel like I destroyed my body, my mind. And I don't know what to do. I don't know if the habilities I used to have will ever even come back. I can't even talk properly nowadays.

I started my own business 2 years ago in an attempt to at least be able to provide decently for myself (I can't yet.).But it has been growing very slow since I can only do so much during my day now. My energy is constantly drained, I can barely speak. And even like that, I improved a lot from how I was when I decided to quit university. At the time I was even worse. 
I have been focusing on losing all the weight I put on to feel healthy again. And I do have some good days. I have some days where I feel like I can be productive. 

The thing is... What am I fighting for exactly? I feel like I lost the whole person I used to be. I want to be good at something, to be someone I can be proud of. But right now my best achievements have been... I don't even know... Being able to brush my teeth everyday. 

I do take medication that helps me a lot. For depression and energy. I also have endometriosis that was recently diagnosed at and advanced state but I am dealing with it and I am also on medication to help.

I just... Feel Lost and without a purpose. And like I am worth nothing.

(Throwaway account because I don’t want people to find this post)

I’ve been with my bf for almost 5 years and we’ve been living together for 3. There’s been so much shit going on between us for the last two years.. I don’t even know where to start. I feel like I’m going insane. 

Context: this morning I woke up to great, sunny weather and I really hoped to go do something outside! I knew he probably wasn’t feeling up to it and my other friends don’t have time. I got sad over it and a little panicky, which made me sigh/breathe loudly sometimes while I was trying to figure out my plans..  Ge noticed and asked me what’s wrong. I tried to be as non-pushy as possible: “I’d really like to go do something today, but my friends don’t have time so if you feel like doing something let me know!” He said he didn’t know yet and we went to the grocery store. 

We’ve been trying to quit smoking weed for a long time. Today would’ve been the day we wouldn’t smoke. We went grocery shopping and when we got home I went into the kitchen to make some coffee. While I was doing this he walked into the kitchen and told me he didn’t want to blame me, but because of me showing and taking about my emotions this morning, he feels like he can’t quit today. I got upset over this and told him I wouldn’t have talked about this if he did not ask. Then he got really defensive and it turned into a fight. 

When he’s upset with me he puts down a lot of boundaries, shows his irritation and puts a lot of blame on me. I don’t feel secure within myself so when he defends himself I usually start to question myself and my reality / experience. These fights usually ends up with me taking the blame and putting my emotions aside. This makes me feel like I’m going insane because our views on the events  are always so different. It’s seems as if there are two options: either he’s been manipulating me and putting me down OR I’m way more unstable than I thought I was. He says I am, and I try to accept that and take my responsibility. Which seems like the right thing to do when someone tells me I hurt them. 

When I try to talk to him about the way he’s treating me and how he’s hurt me he usually tells me a quick , irritated sorry before going on and on about how his behaviour is my fault. I can’t tell him he’s taking no responsibility because then he just deflects and gets more irritated, telling me he did do those things because of my behaviour and that I’m making him crazy by going on and on about it. While I don’t feel like he even tried to make me feel better. Could it be that I’m really that sick in the head that nothings good enough for me? It just doesn’t seem right. 

Putting down a boundary about not wanting to continue talking about the things I’m upset about.. it just doesn’t seem healthy to me.. it feels mean. Why am I not allowed to take up this space?

I am ok with staying in Sukhumvit and could spend up to $200 USD for 4 nights. I have four things I want: no bed bugs, little noise (from road and between rooms), not too expensive and to feel ‘safe’. Safety refers to the location, but also the staff as I have read numerous things about staff going into safes to steal money or expensive items or charging a deposit and not giving it back to people.

There are so many hotels in Bangkok, so there’s a lot to choose from. However, every review I see there is either the last three listed above, but bed bugs were found. Or everything is included above, but the staff have not been honest. So many reviews, too, say that the pictures online are misleading and there’s water leakage in the room or the AC doesn’t work. I do not care at all about the size of the room, if there are robes, if the coffee tastes good, if there's a pool or not. I am not picky. Just don't want any bugs, want to feel safe and don't want to feel ripped off.

1fwpssa,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1fwpssa/caffeine_withdrawal/,Caffeine withdrawal,"I started drinking a cup of coffee daily since I was 10. At around the age of 18, I started drinking four cups a day in order to be able to study at university. When I got a full-time job at the age of 24, I started drinking six cups a day, with two teaspoons each, because of the changes to my routines that my working hours caused. On the 30th of August, something broke inside me after six cups of coffee, including a double espresso, and 20 cigarettes. Since then, I have been gradually reducing the amount of coffee I drink, while experiencing increasingly bad panic attacks after each cup. Since the 2nd of October, I've almost quit: I had four sips of a full cup on Wednesday, one cup with one teaspoon on Thursday and two sips of a cup with one teaspoon today. I've also almost quit smoking (3 puffs a day instead of 25 cigarettes a day).

I thought I would feel better, but I actually feel much worse. I basically feel like I'm on my deathbed. I still feel anxious and miserable, just without the jitters and the racing mind. I had severe muscle fasciculations and some myoclonus, which are now subsiding. However, I feel like my brain has been partly shut off and like it takes active effort to just use my senses. It seems like reality is a very bad nightmare. Benzodiazepines don't help. 

It also seems like my heart has lost its pacemaker. It suddenly starts racing and then slows down while I'm falling asleep. 

My sleep is also ruined. I thought that caffeine prevents sleep and that cutting it out would therefore improve the quality of my sleep, but I now wake up in agony every hour. 

I would have tapered the coffee more gradually if the sudden-onset panic attacks hadn't been that bad. It's almost like I had a stimulant-induced nervous breakdown which forced me to quit cold-turkey. ",0,1728133045.0,decaf,0,0.5,False

Kibitz did a starter location evaluation many moons ago; so I just want to an adjustment to that with 1.0

1. Grassy, easy 

This starter is where all noobs should try out their legs, even without beelining Bladerunners. It also have a special meaning to me as a lot of assets was taken from Slottskogen, Göteborg.

Downside that it is in the far south and everything that really matters is to the north. And it just gets annoying to deal with.

2. Dune Desert.

This is pretty much grassy except it is flatland. Many pioneers swear by it; as makes plenty of room for megabases. 

So if you are thinking like a giant, this is the place for you. Very hard and tedious early game, but the rewards are great. Especially if you wanna turn this game into a train simulator and build a megabase. ;)

3. Rocky Desert

Meh.  Now it finally have sulfur. Kinda. But still it is just a rocky desert. I don't mind going there, but I would never call it home.

4. Northern Forest

Pure node heaven. For being called northern, it is now quite centered. And Gary the Manta is there and easy to ride.. Win win situation.

So why does not everyone just start at northern forest?

If you want megabase it just not gonna cut it. The terrain is very much working against you. Always. Hannah have made it sure that you cant just wing it.

And if you are a noob then as soon you step out of what you thought was safe in grassy, you will be constantly annoyed.

Verdict:
4. Rocky. It got nothing 
3. Dune. It can be great.
2. Grassy. It works. Kinda?
1. Northern. It is pure love.

Hehe. I bet coffee stain would not dare making a northern forest not winding up on the top of this list.

Will also give a shoutout to Hannah. When I first walked into northern forest in like update 3, i could tell it was a pretty placeholder.

It's so beautiful now.

The government has announced cuts to the Winter Fuel Payment in 2024, which means that many elderly people will receive less financial help to keep their homes warm. These cuts have raised concerns about the impact on pensioners, especially those on fixed incomes who are already struggling with rising energy bills.

This article explores what the Winter Fuel Payment cuts mean, how they will affect pensioners, and offers practical tips on how to stay warm this winter, even with reduced financial assistance.

[Winter Fuel Payment](https://preview.redd.it/le27zopbnxsd1.jpg?width=1792&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=89cf363ab5a11a3533b981fb2c5776e65c49fb49)

# What Is the Winter Fuel Payment?

The Winter Fuel Payment is a government benefit designed to help older people manage the cost of heating their homes during the coldest months of the year. It is paid annually to pensioners who are eligible, with the amount depending on age and living circumstances. For many older people, this payment provides crucial support, allowing them to heat their homes without having to worry about high energy bills.

# Winter Fuel Payment Cuts in 2024

In 2024, the government will be cutting the Winter Fuel Payment, reducing the amount that pensioners will receive. This reduction is part of a wider effort by the government to cut public spending, but it has caused concern among pensioners and charities that advocate for the elderly.

The exact amount of the cut varies depending on the pensioner’s age and living situation. Some pensioners may see a reduction of up to 20%, which could leave them struggling to cover the cost of their heating bills. The cuts come at a time when energy prices are already high, adding extra pressure on pensioners to find ways to stay warm on a lower budget.

# How Will Pensioners Be Affected?

For many pensioners, the Winter Fuel Payment is a vital part of their budget. Without it, they may have to make difficult choices about how to spend their money. Some may have to cut back on food or other essentials in order to pay for heating. Others may be forced to reduce the amount of time they have their heating on, leading to colder homes and increased health risks.

Living in a cold home can have serious health consequences for older people. Cold temperatures can increase the risk of respiratory illnesses, heart attacks, and strokes. It can also worsen existing health conditions, making it harder for pensioners to stay healthy during the winter.

The cuts to the Winter Fuel Payment are also likely to increase feelings of isolation among pensioners. Many older people already feel lonely, especially during the winter when it is harder to get out and about. If they are unable to afford to heat their homes properly, they may be less likely to invite friends or family over, further increasing their isolation.

# Government Response

The government has defended the cuts, saying they are necessary to balance the country’s finances. They argue that the cuts are part of a broader effort to reduce public spending and ensure that government support is targeted at those who need it most.

However, many charities and advocacy groups for older people have raised concerns about the impact of the cuts. They argue that pensioners are already struggling with the rising cost of living, and cutting the Winter Fuel Payment will only make things worse. Some have called for the government to reconsider the cuts and provide more support for pensioners during the winter months.

# How Pensioners Can Stay Warm This Winter

Although the cuts to the Winter Fuel Payment are a challenge, there are still ways for pensioners to stay warm this winter. Here are some practical tips:

# 1. Wear Layers

Wearing layers of clothing can help you stay warm without having to rely on heating as much. Thermal underwear, wool socks, and jumpers can all help to keep your body heat in.

# 2. Use Blankets

Keep extra blankets on hand for when you’re sitting or lying down. Using a blanket can help keep you warm, especially if you’re sitting still for long periods of time.

# 3. Seal Drafts

Make sure your home is properly insulated and that there are no drafts around doors and windows. You can use draft excluders or weather stripping to keep cold air from getting in.

# 4. Heat One Room

If you’re trying to save money on heating, focus on heating just one room in your home, especially the one you spend the most time in. This can help reduce your heating costs without leaving you feeling too cold.

# 5. Eat Warm Meals

Eating warm, hearty meals can help you feel warmer from the inside out. Soups, stews, and hot drinks like tea or coffee can help keep your body temperature up.

# 6. Stay Active

Keeping active can help your body stay warm. Even small movements like walking around your home or doing light exercises can help to generate heat.

# 7. Use Curtains

Close your curtains at night to help keep the heat inside. During the day, open them to let in any sunlight, which can help warm up your home.

# 8. Check for Support

Even with the cuts to the Winter Fuel Payment, there may be other forms of support available to you. Check with your local council or energy provider to see if you’re eligible for any other grants or discounts.

# Conclusion

The Winter Fuel Payment cuts in 2024 are likely to have a significant impact on pensioners across the UK. With less financial support available, many older people will need to find new ways to stay warm and manage their heating costs. While the cuts are a challenge, there are still steps that pensioners can take to stay safe and comfortable during the colder months. By wearing warm clothing, sealing drafts, and focusing on heating one room, pensioners can stay warm without breaking the bank.

Please help! ,"I've been struggling with severe anxiety and panic attacks for over 10 years. I've tried all types of different meds, but after my first Covid in 2020 nothing really works as it should. I've been having ups and downs, but not as bad as now, it's never been that bad and it's always been temporary and managed to push through it by distracting, breathing techniques, meds or whatever. HOWEVER in August, 2024 I had a very random, no-symptoms covid and since then my life's been hell. It did something to my brain and I'm not able to function properly - I had severe derealisation, nervous breakdowns, very increased heart rate, severe vertigo and in general I had no idea what's happening to my body. I've had all types of tests - it seems I'm as healthy as never before, so everything is pointing to some sort of nervous system/anxiety problem. I had prescribed 4 different SSRIs - each of them gave me an insane amount of side effects - tremors, increased heart rate, dizziness, overall feeling live I've drank 80 coffees, extreme derealisation, sweating... basically bad and I've felt like I'm dying (or at some points I really preferred dying to continuing feeling like this, it was THAT bad). The meds made some things worse, other symptoms completely went away, but I had to stop each of them (e.g. I took once only 1/4 of Zoloft 50mg and I had the worst experience, even worse with just 1/2 of Flupentixol once). I'm taking nothing now, going only acupuncture and so far it has an amazing effect on me. I'm still feeling bad though, so they prescribed me 5-HTP 50mg - but at this point I'm scared of taking anything and I'm reading mixed opinions and experiences, even though it's just a supplement and not an actual med. 

  
Does anyone know if there's any relation between SSRI intolerance and 5-HTP? Is there a chance for it to work despite the SSRI intolerance? OR because I'm intolerant to SSRIs it might make me feel bad again? 

I hate that everything with this types of conditions is trial and error, so I'm desperate. Any opinion/knowledge sharing would be of huge help. ",1,1728131583.0,antidepressants,2,1.0,False

I woke up, i saw my mother and my grandma, just a conversation. Drank coffee, pack up my things. I was conscious that something was going to happen, but i didn’t knew what. Nothing particular happened at the time. Some minutes later, i’m at a amusement park, for some reason, there was a jovial and party atmosphere, almost like it is my birthday. I could hear calling voices and saw blurred and static figures, but that didn’t meant anything. There was nobody in there, except, for myself. I could talk to myself, like i was two persons at the same time. The dream suddenly started to give a really cold atmosphere, leaves started to fall apart and, for some reason, there was a little snow. 


The jovial aura, ended. Now it was depressing. We got on a roller coaster, we talked there about solitude, friendship,  family and other things. The trail ended. He said his time was up. I didn’t wanted to let him go, he was the only person to acommpany me. I started chasing him, we got far from the park, to a really tall tower, he started climbing and me behind him, after a long time, i finnally got him on top, only for him to say goodbye and shoot himself on the forehead, blood covered all the floor and i couldn’t believe it. It felt so real for a moment. 

I returned home, depressed, everything was envolved in a horrific aura, almost like if something really bad was going to happen. I started wandering the rooms, searching for my family, i knew nobody was there, but some stupid impulse made me wanted to look for other people. I went up the stairs, i entered my own room, only for the dream to end suddenly before i could even watch inside. I woke up at my bed, and like it was everything prepared, my mom came into my room to ask me some random stuff XD.",1,1728131520.0,Dreams,0,1.0,False

I am 40 and around  June 2024, i wanted to start eating healthy and started eating carrots and cucumber along with regular breakfast and it was going fine for a a week or two after which i started to lose weight pretty rapidly and then i thought it was the veggies doing the magic and the third day i had intense gnawing feeling in the stomach as if some one was sucking out energy out of my stomach and my whole body felt weak, i kept eating anything i could find to make the feeling go away but no matter what i ate, its as if its going to an empty pit and my body has decided not to derive any energy from the food, that lasted a few days after which i started to get myraid of symptoms, heart palpitations, shortness of breath, night sweats ( not drenching sweats but i would feel too warm and sweaty that i had to take off the blanket), stomach burning feeling in the middle of night, muscle spasms, pressure in the head, pressure behind eyes, skins burning sensation at different places and sudden warm and cold sensations. I would also feel like sudden electric jolts in the my brain. After those symptoms slowly i started to get some thing crawling sensation in my skin and also in my head. The symptoms would change every hour and a different symptom decides to take over. I also have loose stools ( not watery but not well formed either). and i had to go multiple times few days like right after eating and few times 3 or 4 times a day. But eitherway my stool were mushy for few years now and i cant remember when was the last time i had well formed stools. For background As a kid i used to be very constipated and issues having proper bowel movement untill i came to USA (20 years ago) and i magically started to have regular bowel movements.

Anyways After a week of all these symptoms i went to primary care and he tested for CBC ( without differential) , checked for Thyroid and Testoesterone, b12, vitamin D and most of it came back normal except HBA1c was 6.0, Vitamin D was 17 during last physical and now it was 21.3, Glucose 102 and ALT(SGPT) 56. Doctor said it was anxiety and since HBA1c is little high i am prediabetic( i was not prediabetic before) so just eat more protien and less carbs. After two days i had intense shortness of breath and intense heart palpitations. So went to the Doctors office and to get an xray and EKG. Both came back normal. They referred me to GI since to see if some thing may be going on with stomach since i was having all the intense burning in the stomach in the middle of night ( i never had this problem before) and i was the kind of a person who could drink coffee and go to sleep with no issues. In the mean while i was searching google for all cancers and all possible infections that could cause such symptoms and i read that L Lysine helps with  viruses and backeria, so i thought i would give it a try and it did indeed help me to a point where it reduced the brain jolts and muscle spasms, i was taking 500mg 3 times a day. I was atleast able to function everyday while taking it but my weight loss symptoms and body aches used to come and go.

Either way, i got the Gi appointment 3 weeks out and they did Colonoscopy, Endoscopy( i had some blood  in poop once weeks before these issues started) and also check for HPylor. GI also checked for Iron levels and they were normal. By this time my stomach issues improved to some extent without doing anything. Gi said everything looks normal except a small polyp or whatever you call it which is like internal hamerroid which could have caused the blood but it is not big enough to cause an issue. Endoscopy looked clear and no HPylor from biopsy. Gi doc did say my spincher that connects stomach and eosophagus looks irritated and may not be closing all the way which could explain the burning feeling and i may have GERD. He said if i have any more issues then i can followup but at the moment there is nothing else to do. They also prescribed probiotics for lose stools and i am taking them occasionally( they gave me a sample of VLS3). If i take one or two i get properly formed poop for two days and on third day its back to mushy. Not sure if i have to use VLS3 for long time to fix any GUT issues or for it to make a difference. I am also drinking yogurt every day and kefir occasionally at home.

Right now its been 3 months since the symptoms started and i cannot trust my body at all as i cannot be sure what my body is going to do next moment. As of now i lost 7 pounds since onset of symptoms and i am desperately trying to not lose weight by eating more and more but no matter how much i eat, i dont seem to gain weight and i am barely able to keep the same weight. I do get intense hunger and bouts of intense fatigue every two to 3 days. Recently i also started to get mild upper back ache, like between shoulder blades, and also had ache under collar bone. I have been reading up a lot on autoimmune,  POTS and dysautonomia to see if any of these fit and at this point i am lost. I have no idea what is going on and have lost trust on my body on what could happen the next moment. I also wondered if there is any inflammation that could be going on in my body which is what is contributing to these problems and took an advil and i did feel some improvement the day after. But the next day when i took advil, it gave me a stomach ache so i stopped. But overall ibuprofen seems to reduce the intensity of my symptoms to some extent. Right now i tapered off Lysine to 500 mg once before sleep. My current  symptoms are mild back ache , intense fatigue, weight loss( even if i overeat), shortness of breath occasionally, something moving in brain feeling but is milder than before. ( skin burning sensation and stomach burning has gone away or significantly reduced). Biggest issue being the intense onset of fatigue and weight loss no matter what i eat.

One thing about my background i can say is that I used to get the intense hunger and sudden weight loss symptoms whenever i did cardio for a month straight burning 500 cals a day when i would not lose anything and then i would start losing weight normally but after i hit about 10 pounds mark, i would suddenly get this intense hunger and my skin crawling sensations would start and i would feel hollow inside my body. It scared the shitout and i would stop the cardio from then on and start taking b complex and start to eat normal food and i would be back to normal in few days. This kind of thing happened on 3 different weight loss attempts in the past 10 years. But this time even though i take B complex and eat normal things do not seem to improve. I am at a loss of what is going on with my body.

10/4 . Currently my ongoing symptoms are that i feel wierd hunger/ nauseated feeling in upper part of stomach with fatigue and when that happens i know i am start to drop weight and eating food only keeps that feeling at bay for Short time and then i have sore muscles and i am randomly getting bouts if severe sleepiness throughout the day. My dark circles are still there. I still get burning feel around my collar bone area time to time. My poop is still mushy and may not be well formed

You still need to drag the espresso parts over to the grinder and back. It still takes awhile for the coffee to grind.

Statement of Sarah Hopkins regarding a hand she found on the Temple of the Wind’s nature trail. Statement originally recorded 28th July 2008.
 
Statement Begins
 
I don’t know how to start this. I know what your institute is about, psychics, ghosts, weird artefacts or whatever weird topics no other academic would touch with a stick. Still, I don’t feel like you’ll believe me. I wouldn’t believe me. I still want to deny it but the bruising on my arm tells me some part of it was real at the least and if it is real then people are in danger. I’m not going to throw myself out there like a raving lunatic to be ridiculed by the public but your institute is used to that. At the least you’ll check it out and my name won’t be connected to it at all. I’ve read your privacy agreement if you leak this anywhere, I will sue.
 
I shouldn’t have even been out there, blame my infuriating co-workers. They are always complaining about me. They act so concerned to my face saying “Oh Sarah take it easy you don’t have to take on so many duties, you haven’t even had a break yet. Just take a minute.” I know they are really just annoyed that I make them look bad in comparison. I enjoy the heavy workload; it pushes me to keep working harder, to keep improving myself. There’s a joy to be found in being able to cope under the pressure that would crush others. They’re just jealous of my dedication to the business. I’m not naming names; you don’t get to know who I work for. Remember I want discretion or the next statement you read will be from my lawyers.
 
I normally ignore them knowing they just want me to ease my workload so that our employer doesn’t realise how useless they are in comparison. I’ll admit despite enjoying it I felt like I was starting to crumble underneath it’s weight. Too many late nights at the office and not enough sleep. I was starting to see paperwork every time I closed my eyes, I could feel my body wearing down from overworking myself. I ended up talking to my therapist about it and she suggested I ease up and try a hobby that would let me enjoy some peace, something entirely stress free.
 
I don’t know why but I decided to try asking one of my coworkers for a suggestion. Gary Bolan is an older man who’s getting close to retirement, he wasn’t a slacker but his heart definitely wasn’t in it anymore. I think I thought since he was such a calm mild old man he’d have some good suggestions. He seemed shocked that I’d want to find such a peaceful hobby and I don’t blame him. He fumbled for an idea and suggested trail walks. Walking through the woods in the quiet. A waste of time in my opinion but my therapist recommended something before I crashed from overworking so I just smiled and thanked him for it.
 
I planned it out for that weekend, a 2-hour car journey to West Sussex for the Temple of the Wind’s nature trail. I had done my research it seemed like a simple trail for beginners and I thought I could walk it quick, grab a coffee then head home. I didn’t enjoy it. It was a hot sunny Saturday and the car journey ended up taking longer than I hoped getting stuck in traffic. By the time I was there it was starting to get busy. I thought people went on nature walks for the quiet. Every person who past me greeted me leaving no time to try and enjoy the quiet of the woods. I was getting fed up especially when the kids started showing up. I was hot, tired and generally in a bad mood that I had wasted my day on Gary’s lazy suggestion. I was about to turn around when I saw a side path that no one was walking. It was a narrow path winding deeper in to the woods without a person in sight. I decided that I wouldn’t let the day go to waste and took it.
 
I nearly started to enjoy the walk; the isolation of the woods was pleasant. The foliage blocked out the sun due to how packed and dense the forest became down here and I couldn’t even see another person walking the trail.  I almost saw myself making a monthly trip down there to unwind for a few hours. Until I reached the clearing.
 
It was a small patch of earth where no trees grew, the earth was dry and cracked from the heat of the summer with the only notable thing to see being what was protruding from the centre. A hand stood proud from the ground, only visible up to just before the elbow. It did not lay flat. It was angled on a slant upwards as though waiting for another to offer their own hand to help pull it up and out of the Earth. The soil around it was dry, dusty undisturbed. I wondered just how long it had been there since it didn’t seem like it had been buried recently.
 
I wasn’t horrified by it or anything. My first thought was “Was it fake?”. I’m not a doctor or have any medical knowledge but I knew that even with rigour mortis a hand wouldn’t pose itself like that. The wrist was not limp but angled. The fingers did not dangle from the knuckle but neither were they curled tightly in to a tight clutch. They sat waiting as though poised for a professional handshake.
 
I questioned whether it was an old Halloween decoration left out too long. The skin of the arm was grey and dry to the point of cracking. There was no moisture in the limb but it had not shrivelled in any obvious way. Old rubber maybe? No signs of animals feeding upon it not even insects. The only damage was at the fingertips.
 
The nails were all broken. They were either gone entirely or simply some splintered shards above the cuticles, not a mark of blood upon them just caked in dry mud. The skin on the tips didn’t fare much better with the same coating of grime upon them, they looked heavily worn, maybe dragged across the floor or from animals brushing past it. It was a realistic hand plastered in mud but it did not look right for a cadaver at all. No rot, no decay, nor parasites. It felt wrong. I felt the need to examine it just a little closer. Just a touch to feel whether it was flesh or silicone to reassure myself that I hadn’t just stumbled upon a dead body alone in the woods.
 
Whether out of superstition or fear it was obvious that shaking the hand of a possible dead body was a terrible idea no matter your beliefs. I just wanted a quick feel and the outcome would either be walking away or a quick call to emergency services followed by the reassurance of others dealing with it instead.
 
I crouched down and reached out to touch it when hesitation led to my own hand freezing mere centimetres from making contact with the mottled cracked skin. I had the realisation that if it was a dead body then I’d be alone with a corpse that someone very likely intentionally buried. I’d be disturbing a murder scene. The police would come and ask me an endless number of questions but before that I’d be stuck alone in the woods trapped with a dead body with the fear of what would happen if the killer came back before then. Finally, I had the realisation that what a dead body felt like was not something I wanted to know.
 
My thoughts echoed in the silence, everything frozen just like the hand. Until it wasn’t. With a loud snap the hand contorted in a sudden jerking motion snapping its radius and ulna in two. The jagged end’s protruding from the forearm but not a drop of blood spilt.
 
I was in a state of shock, it happened so fast I didn’t have enough time to flinch much less process what I was witnessing. It took less than a second for the whole hand to crack and snap itself bending to latch around my wrist like a trap going off.
 
I screamed. I didn’t understand what was happening but my immediate response was to back away. Having fallen from my crouching position I tried to crawl backwards but it had my arm. I tried pulling away from it but it did not give. It felt far too heavy. It felt like I was chained to a boulder, it didn’t budge in the slightest despite using all my strength.
 
Pain shot up my arm and I saw those filthy fingers tightening around my forearm trying to burrow in to my skin through pure strength and the shards of nail they had left. It felt like a jagged vice closing around my arm.
 
Nothing was working I had nearly dislocated my arm at this point trying to drag myself away from it but the fingers could not be pried away from my skin.
 
I was so desperate to be free I didn’t notice it at first. It started quiet but as it got louder, I heard it. From below a humming noise, like a stampede. At first, I thought something was charging towards me but no that wasn’t right it sounded more like scratching, clawing. Something was digging.
 
With my other hand pressed against the earth I felt it. The vibrations from below. The person buried below was digging themselves free but something was wrong. It felt too strong, too loud. How many were buried beneath me?
 
This instilled a deeper panic in me. I understood my time was limited so I tried to think of a better way. I glanced at the hand that had trapped me, it still looked lifeless. It was ice cold, mottled grey and purple beneath the mud. The wound from its snapping had gotten worse. The greasy bone was slicing the flesh around the initial fracture making the tear larger yet still no blood trickled from it.
 
This gave me an idea. I rose to my feet still hunched over from the forceful arm gripping on to me and I quickly circled it. It didn’t resist my movement still only focused on burrowing its fingertips in to the flesh of my arm. With each lap around it its skin was twisted around itself scraping against the snapped bones tighter and tighter until something had to give.
 
The vibrations from below were getting louder now and the dry soil was starting to crack from the force. I wasn’t deterred. It pushed me forward as I ignored the pain in my arm and did one final lap.
 
With the sound of a snapping rope the earth fell silent once more. For just a moment the hand kept its grip on me before limply falling to the ground as a freshly severed arm should. I stepped away from it just in case it lunged at me again and examined my arm.
 
The pain was incredible, even now freed I couldn’t move my hand. It had cut off the circulation leaving it swollen with a blueish hue. My forearm was much worse already darkened with bruises of every hue with blood running down it from where the skin had torn from the pressure. My arm throbbed with pain and I knew my bones had stress fractures from its grasp.
 
As I took a step to leave my heart sank. From the earth beneath me I heard a faint scratching sound, joined by another and then another until a cacophony of scraping soil was coming from beneath my feet.
 
I ran as fast as I could back the way I came, back towards the hiking trail. I heard the ground shift behind me. Whatever had been beneath had finally emerged and it sounded far larger than a person. I hoped it had just been more waiting hands that wouldn’t leave the dirt but I wasn’t so fortunate. What followed behind me was large, I heard the pounding of a heavy weight against the earth as it continued its pursuit with the noise of flailing limbs accompanying it. It felt like it was reaching out for me but I didn’t turn around, I didn’t look back. I knew if I saw it, I’d freeze or trip and it would take me. I wouldn’t let it take me.
 
I had run past so many trees too fast I didn’t know where I was anymore, I couldn’t survey my surroundings, I knew if I stopped running, I wouldn’t be able to start again. I was crying at this point wailing for help. I was falling in to despair knowing that the thing would catch me again. I was almost willing to let it before I saw a figure approaching.
 
It was an older man in cargo shorts and a yellow T-shirt carrying with him a rucksack. He must’ve come from the main trail. He must’ve heard my screams from when I was first grabbed.
 
I tried to warn him to run but he looked panicked and so lost. I didn’t stop running. I didn’t even reach out to grab him out of fear of tripping myself by mistake. All I did was watch his expression quickly shift from one of shock to pure horror as he saw what chased me as I passed him.
 
I think he tried to run but he took too long, his bag weighed him down. I don’t think he got more than a few feet before it got him. I heard the noise and knew it got him, the screaming had begun and the pounding had stopped. I stopped running and turned to make sure. I stood there and witnessed that man’s death.
 
The thing was large, I had thought it was many when it first got me but no it was just one. It jutted out in many directions, arms and hands of every pigment sprouting out of each other. Joints connecting to joints connecting to arms that either led to hands or more arms. All of them looked like that first hand. Cracking pale skin coated in dirt and mud even more heavily than the hand that protruded. If it had a body, I couldn’t see it hidden under so many limbs.
 
It had grabbed the man by his left arm and started pulling him in. It had bowed its front and allowed the hands that lined what could be called its back to hold him. His screams increased in volume.
 
I could see all the hands wrapped around him. They had pinned him from his shoulders to his feet. He still struggled trying to pull himself away keeping his head and right arm away from the hands that reached for them.
 
I saw the grip start to tighten and glanced at my own arm. It wasn’t long until snapping sounds started to come from his body. His feet snapped to the sides so more hands could get hold. I heard his ribs crack from the many sets of hands clutching his torso.
 
I had hoped he would have died by this point, that the shock of so much pain at once would see him off to end his torment but it didn’t. It should have but still he kept screaming and struggling even as his clothes grew damp. He was being squeezed like a lemon and still he lived.
 
It was at this point I noticed the hands that supported the mass were moving. I was almost hysterical knowing I could not run anymore but I realised it wasn’t approaching me. It was digging. Throwing dirt to the sides of a hole it was sculpting in the ground. It was slowly submerging itself as it tortured this man.
 
Things happened faster by this time. The creature quickly lowered itself back in to the Earth. Laying in its hole it finally reached more limbs around restraining the man’s head and arm. It kept his arm upright his hand still in a frenzy above all else.
 
What it did to his head. I couldn’t watch. Two hands caressed the sides of his face aligning the majority of their fingers around his eyes. As they tightened his guttural screams allowed two more limbs to reach their fingers in to his mouth and hold his jaw open.
 
The thing simply held him like this as it burrowed itself a few feet deeper. Its upper limbs started to drag the mounds of soil around it in to the hole. I could hear the man choking on more and more soil with every scoop.
 
By the time the hole was refilled the man had finally fallen silent. The other hands had receded with the rest of the body returning to the earth. All that was left behind was the old man’s hand drained of blood pallid and stained with dirt, extended as though offering a hand shake.
 
I left and told no one about this. I’m not going to the police about this, they won’t believe me, but I still feel guilt for that stranger so if your little institute wants proof of a real monster send some researchers there and deal with it so no one else has to die like that.
 
I can still feel it. It’s been two weeks and my arm is still healing. I still can’t grip things too well with it. It’s likely just the pain but I can still feel its grip around my arm. Those broken nails piercing my skin. Its cold skin pressed against mine. I was nearly a part of that thing. One day someone would’ve grabbed my waiting hand and I’d have pulled them in to the crushing embrace of it.
 
I’m sorry. I’m done now please don’t contact me about this in the future.

Would you go in this situation? ,"So I had a friend A (who works with me) for 1 year who hung out with me often. Then she became unfair and always bailed on me last minute. On my birthday party that I had been planning for months, she texted me at 11pm to say she had napped and wasn’t coming but was going to our mutual friends house tomorrow so I would see her there? 
No apology. She also texted me twice for lunch and I set up the lunch meeting and then she just cancelled on the day and said she’s sick and one day I went there and she didn’t even come, but her boyfriend told me. Another friend, friend B, from work and I, who used to be very close, don’t talk anymore. Friend A’s boyfriend loves to gossip and tried to find out why myself and friend B are not friends so that he could tell friend B back everything I would say.

I am obviously now annoyed with friend B and friend B’s boyfriend. They are getting engaged and after 7 MONTHS of me and friend B not seeing each other, she sends a text like “to my favourite girl! I’m inviting you to my wedding and to my engagement party hope you can make both!””

For the wedding, it is a 9 hour flight away so I am not going. The engagement- she said it’s end of November “ISH “ and didn’t specify a date. I can either say 

1.) yes I’m coming to the engagement and then just pretend to be sick one day before or whatever (like she has done to me 4-5 times now) 

2.) hey no I’m not coming as my family are visiting at this time (this is true) so I will be busy and I am also now not a party person anymore. However would love to have coffee/ lunch/ evening meal together one day? 


I know that friend B is not a life long friend and partly only wonder if I’m invited to make an extra number for the party or so her boyfriend can get gossip out of me. What should I say? ",4,1728130651.0,Mindfulness,9,0.67,False

1fwp26g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Preschoolers/comments/1fwp26g/daughter_being_targeted_by_a_student_at_school/,Daughter being Targeted by a student at school. How can I help? ,"My 4y daughter attends a private (and EXPENSIVE!) Montessori pre school program. This is her second year there and she loves it! She will be finishing up this year before heading to kindergarten.

Almost every single day she is coming home with stories about another kid that is seemingly terrorizing the classroom, and often times targeting her. 

Some of the stories I've heard (granted, from a 4.5 year old, but she's pretty honest and actually nervous about attending school now):

This kid has broken glass and thrown it into the toilet. He's flipped the table my daughter was having a tea party at with her friend. He's broken every glass item in the class, used for learning practical skills. Smashed the globe. Threw a block at the teachers coffee and made it spill. 

In addition to being a general menace, he has physically hurt my daughter at least 3 times now. Last week, he slapped her in the face. I was NOT notified by the school, she told me herself and I had to reach out and request clarification. The next day he pushed her in line. Yesterday he threw a large wooden block at her head. She is a pretty shy and quiet kid so teaching her to stand up for herself in these situations has been a challenge but an important lesson. 

I'm a teacher myself and understand this kid may be struggling with something I have no idea about. But I am not happy with how the school is handling these repeat instances. Once was too much. 3 times in 2 weeks? I'm scheduling a meeting to go talk to them next week. Any advice is appreciated. ",9,1728130597.0,Preschoolers,10,0.91,False

Today's theme is self-sabotaging. I am in my all time low since last year because of so many things that have been bothering me, both at work and personal matters. I wasn't able to focus at work today because of pent up frustrations. 

Some advice or maybe a listening ear would help. If you're around downtown, maybe we could talk over dinner or coffee. If you're not physically available, a chat or call wil do.

In case it has any relevance at all, I also suffer from depression and anxiety, which in times can make me relate to him while also seeing him as this unnattainable standard. All this said, Ive never been one to glorify celebrities or go all crazy over them and honestly I find it disturbing the lengths some ppl will go to just bc they like an artist or something. That said, last night, I dreamt I met Chris in a coffee shop. It was very short, as he seemed to be about to leave, surrounded by bodyguards and adoring fans, but even then he looked at me and acknowledged me and even said maybe one or two words I cant remember rn. All I remember is feeling like I had so little time, and as he walked out I said something like ""youre my absolute hero as a singer!"" but he never turned around like I was hoping, and simply walked out, back facing me. Idk who else was supposed to be there with me, but I said to someone ""I wish I could save him"" but all they could do was assure me that it was unfortunately impossible. This is a really strange dream and Ive never rlly had one like it, I didnt remember it immediately as I woke up, but as soon as I did I couldnt stop sobbing.",4,1728130494.0,Soundgarden,0,1.0,False

I previously made a post about starting a weekly Cold Brew subscription service, focused on using quality roasts, brewed to perfection, and delivered to your home/office weekly, at thrice as cheap as what you'd spend in a cafe!

Previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/ahmedabad/s/i8vSiXBNPa

With Navaratri keepin us up late, that extra caffeine boost is 100% needed.

I've finally decided to follow up on that, and I want to start with 10 customers! Reply with your interest, and I'll send you a seperate deck with the pricing and subscription option.

I'll be brewing a new roast every week, and roasts that get the most positive reviews will be brought back.

P.S. First 10 people also get a good good discount

I haven't been able to find much about Belgian roasters in the subs of reddit. Is Belgian coffee culture not really a big thing?

Places to visit I've come across so far:

* Corica (roaster and café)
* Wide Awake (roaster and café)
* OR coffee (roaster - seemingly sold at Izzy Coffee)
* Various cafés mentioned: Frank., Fika, Kaffabar, Cafe Capitale, Café Columbia.

SW 235 CW 201. 34lbs in 5 months, not terrible. We stepped up meds and started with 15mg phen first 2 months, then by my choice alternated 15mg every other day with the 37.5mg phen for two months. Last month I chose to go fully to 37.5mg since the kids went back to school and I knew my workout routine wouldn’t be as strict. Through the 5 months I did 50mg of Top - 25mg in morning and night. At first I didn’t work out at all but the middle two months I did strength training 3 times a week and was very mindful of my steps and extra walks. September brought back school and activities for the kids and no time for working out. I had no real adverse side effects. First week some elevated heart rate, definitely helped with focus daily. The top makes soda flat. Cut energy drinks but not coffee, constant post nasal drip feeling but I felt great on it until the last month. High stress time at work and my anxiety was at level 10 which I couldn’t decide if it was due to increasing to full dose or work so chose to cut the med for a bit. We discussed a “break” at six months and my doctor was ok waiting until after the holidays and breaking in January. On Monday I pulled the plug and figured let’s break for October and start fresh in November hoping to jump start more loss. 

Not even a week in and I am struggling already. She said I can stay on Top during the break but I’m already seeing a very slight gain - I’m hoping due to less water intake, hormones etc…Anyone have any luck with a month break? Does it really reset and work better when you start again? Can you hold off gaining it all back in that time? I personally don’t visually see the difference in the 34lbs so I would love to go back on and progress another 30 or so the next 6 months. ",1,1728130157.0,PhentermineTopiramate,0,1.0,False
