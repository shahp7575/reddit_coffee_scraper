For more than a decade, Indigenous residents campaigned for the Aboriginal flag to join the Australian one on Anzac Hill, a site held sacred by the Arrernte people that also serves as the town’s war memorial.



But Price, a town councillor in 2018, remained opposed. She questioned whether the flag’s supporters truly represented Arrernte wishes. The plan, she warned, was “too divisive”.



Price, 44, wants to unite the country under the Australian flag. Last week, draped in the Southern Cross and Union Jack, she gave a rousing speech in the Senate calling for burning of the flag to be banned. When she was joined by One Nation leader Pauline Hanson, the face of conservative race politics in Australia for decades, Price leapt to her defence. “You vilify her,” Price said of the government’s treatment of Hanson. “You’ve made her out to be a racist in this country.”



That same afternoon, Price suggested the government was prioritising Indian migration to shore up votes. She quickly retracted the comment but refused to apologise. A week later, her defiance still dominating headlines, she declined to support her leader, Sussan Ley. By late Wednesday evening, she had been sacked as a shadow minister.



But even before she was moved off the Liberal frontbench, Price was pursuing an agenda closer to that of the conservative lobby group, Advance, which she worked for before entering the Senate.



Images of Price draped in the Australian flag last week were shared across Advance’s social media. The same campaign vehicle calls for an end to “migration madness” and attacks sitting Liberals. It has amassed 500,000 supporters. Serving on Advance’s advisory council is Tony Abbott, Australia’s 28th prime minister, and Price’s mentor.



Both Abbott and Price’s father, a white former cultural consultant, have argued against the history of the stolen generations taught in schools and universities. Price claims without evidence that the descendants of Indigenous people who were forcibly taken from their mothers are now wealthier than their peers. At the same time, she says too few children are being removed by child protection authorities due to a “stolen generations stigma”.

Price defends Hanson on flag burning ban

Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price accused the government of bullying the One Nation senator.



The Warlpiri-Celtic senator – who once shared a meme comparing Black Lives Matter protesters to Nazis – is more divisive than ever. Now on the backbench, she is no longer talking about the defence industry. She is free to wage her larger campaign: to remake the Liberal Party.



Does she want to be prime minister one day? As she told Sky News in May, “There’s a lot of Australians who would love to see that.”



Price declined interview requests and did not respond to questions for this article.



Rise of the ‘rock star’

Jacinta Suzette Yangapi Nampijinpa Price is not an Australian conservative from central casting.



She fell pregnant with her first child in high school. Later, on weekends without her children, she took ecstasy and went on three-day benders. She was never involved in student politics because she never went to university. She worked in art galleries and rapped under the stage name Sassy-J in a band called Catch the Fly.



One of the happiest times in her life was spent playing the best friend of a giant honey ant called Yamba on television.



“She was such a creative and talented person,” says Julie McAllan, who produced the award-nominated children’s show about Indigenous health and education. “She was an artist, she wrote songs, she sang, she performed on stage. She was everything a television producer ever dreamt of, and she was local. After she was hired, I said we’d end up going national with this show.”



McAllan says Price was dedicated to improving the lives of vulnerable Aboriginal kids. The pair went on to travel the country with Yamba, visiting thousands of children across remote communities with the help of at least $359,000 in government funding for their production company.



But Price truly went national in January 2016, with a 1400-word Facebook post defending the date of Australia Day.



“Without any warning, it changed my life,” Price, who was then an Alice Springs councillor, writes in her memoir, Matters of the Heart, released this year. “Suddenly the media was contacting me and I was inundated with requests to speak … The fact that I was a young Indigenous woman from the bush, and that I called it as I saw it, added a new dimension to the discussion.”

The Centre for Independent Studies, a conservative think tank, invited her to give a talk on domestic violence. An invitation from the National Press Club followed. She began appearing on Sky News, writing opinion pieces for News Corp publications, and became a spokesperson for a new conservative lobby group, then known as Advance Australia.



“Would you rather offend someone, and save a life, or keep your mouth shut?” she asked in a 2018 interview with Peta Credlin, a Sky commentator and former chief of staff to Tony Abbott.



By the time Price gave her maiden speech in parliament in 2022, wearing a traditional feathered headdress, she was one of Australia’s leading conservative voices on Indigenous affairs. Then the No campaign transformed the charismatic, plain-speaking senator into a rare character for Australia: a political celebrity.

Tickets to see her speak sold out. People lined up for photographs and signatures. She has more social media followers than any other Coalition MP. Her presence at a fundraising dinner can command $10,000 a seat. In both 2023 and 2024, Resolve Political Monitor polls ranked her among Australia’s most well-liked leaders. Her closest colleagues call her a “rock star”.



The boosters

Open the Advance website today, and the first face you see is Price’s.



The right-wing campaign group has become a central part of Australia’s conservative ecosystem since it launched as a “grassroots” organisation in 2018, backed by a handful of Australia’s richest people. Its network of prominent donors includes board members of the Centre for Independent Studies and the Institute of Public Affairs, both right-leaning think tanks that have influenced Liberal Party policy for decades.



All three organisations have embraced Price and propelled her political career, covering flights or accommodation for her to attend their events, according to her register of interests. Price’s partnership with Advance has been the closest: her role as lead spokesperson for the Voice campaign involved Advance covering “modest expenses” at its events, including a 12-day speaking tour, and flying one of her sons to Brisbane.



This kind of support is not a new phenomenon, says Dominic Kelly, author of Political Troglodytes and Economic Lunatics: The Hard Right in Australia. “When they do emerge, these Aboriginal voices who are conservative, the groups like the CIS and Quadrant and the IPA are very keen to get in touch with them,” Kelly says. “They saw that Jacinta was a star that they could get behind.”



The outspoken senator says she cannot be manipulated.



“I don’t doubt at all that there are those who would regard me as a gift to the conservative side of politics,” she told Australian Story. “But there’s no way I would allow anybody to use me.”



Price hasn’t declared any professional relationship with Advance since the referendum. A spokesman for Advance said: “While there is no formal or financial relationship between Advance and the senator, she will always have the backing of our \[463,825\] supporters.”



But two years after the referendum’s defeat, Price and Advance still appear closely aligned. “Nearly everything she does is pushed by Advance,” says a Liberal MP, one of several who were granted anonymity to speak frankly for this article.



After the Coalition’s election loss in May, Advance emailed its mailing list, asking supporters to become monthly donors. The email was signed off by Price.



“Become an Advance partner and help Australia win again,” Price wrote, as first reported by independent news website The Klaxon.



A consultancy linked to Advance also helps write Price’s supporter emails and manage her inbox, according to invoices released last month under freedom of information laws.



Whitestone Strategic describes itself as “Australia’s conservative campaign consultancy” and was contracted by Advance during the No campaign. The firm’s director is Advance campaign strategist, Stephen Doyle, whom Price described in her book as one of the “sharpest political strategists I’ve ever worked with”.



Whitestone billed taxpayers $2750 in August, October, November and December last year, and January this year, for its services to Price. That included $2000 for “supporter communications” and $500 for “inbox management”, plus GST. The company also charged the senator almost $70,000 over 2023 and 2024, The Guardian reported last year.

Political leadership

Price was demoted, not discarded. And that spells trouble for Ley

James Massola

James Massola

Chief Political Commentator



Advance is now running three campaigns: to dump net zero climate targets; stop “mass immigration”; and end Welcome to Country ceremonies.



Not one of these stances is Liberal policy. Price has been vocal on all three. She appears as the face of Advance’s fight against Welcome to Country. She vowed to fight “the ramifications of mass migration” and “the economically immiserating and freedom-eroding policy of net zero” in her first statement as a newly unshackled backbencher.



“Advance will always encourage politicians who align with our supporters and criticise those who don’t,” the Advance spokesman says.



It was Price’s freelancing on the topic of “mass migration” – a phrase rejected by Liberal immigration spokesman Paul Scarr – on the ABC this month that went further than any of her colleagues and landed her in trouble. A Liberal Party source says they believe Price wanted to show her support for recent anti-immigration rallies, which she did not attend.



“It was the view of the right … to say these were great. She was trying to replicate that part of the ecosystem,” they say.



Price says she was disappointed by colleagues who did not back her argument.



Advance is also willing to attack Liberals on the issue. A recent Advance Facebook post warning of worsening traffic and fraying social cohesion included a picture of Scarr with members of the Sikh community. Several other Advance posts feature AI-generated images of people with dark hair and brown skin massing in queues at the airport or outside a rental property.



“In relation to your question about our content, Advance opposes Labor’s mass immigration policies for no other reason than they are undermining this nation’s security and prosperity,” the Advance spokesman says.



“But asking us if we are racists in the same breath as you question our support for an Indigenous senator is what we’ve come to expect from the mainstream media.”

Maurice Newman, a businessman who helped establish the Centre for Independent Studies and has served on Advance’s advisory council “since day dot”, denies Advance’s immigration campaigning is racist.



“This whole discussion about racism is totally unnecessary and divisive,” he says. Asked about the group’s attacks on Liberals, Newman responds: “If the cap fits, it should be worn.”



The mentor

Colleagues who observe Price see a senator searching for relevance. “She’s looking for her Voice 2.0,” says one. “She took that thing and killed it. That’s what she’s seeking again.”



After the referendum, Price said she wanted to focus on transgender issues. Then she called for a national debate on abortion, saying pregnancies ended after the first trimester were immoral. But that was slapped down by then opposition leader Peter Dutton. In her memoir, published months later, she wrote that she had no moral objection to abortion and “totally supported a woman’s right to choose what happens to her body”.



Some MPs say these episodes have exposed Price as a political amateur who rose up the ranks too fast and is out of her depth on policy. “There’s only been one or two issues she’s been able to pick up and take off, and they’re the very divisive ones,” says another Liberal.

“But she’s got conservative right-wing support throughout the country because of her stance on the Voice. ”



Price also has a powerful supporter in Tony Abbott. Still active behind the scenes of the Liberal Party, he is a long-time member of Advance’s advisory council.



Abbott helped orchestrate Price’s move to the Liberals, as well as her failed deputy leadership bid. “Tony Abbott has long been a strong supporter of Jacinta,” says Natasha Griggs, president of the Northern Territory’s Country Liberal Party. “He spoke with me earlier this year and again made clear his view about the contribution she can make.”



Those interventions frustrate Liberals who disagree with Abbott’s vision for the party.



“Abbott is behind all of this. He pretends he’s doing nothing, but he’s actively trying to drag the party, kicking and screaming, to where Advance is. They think they’re Nigel Farage and they’re going to save Australia,” says one MP.



“She gets a lot of guidance from him. The connection with Advance is there. Every time something happens for her, she’s on \[Sky News with Peta\] Credlin. That’s her safe space because they’re the people that guide her.”



Abbott declined to comment. In a post on X he said: “Jacinta Price will be a big loss to the frontbench but I’m confident that she will continue to make a strong contribution to our public life.”



The family

Fifteen years ago, Lasseters Casino in Alice Springs refused entry to a 49-year-old Aboriginal woman on the grounds she was intoxicated.



“I put it down to racism,” the woman would later tell the media, denying she had been drunk. After police attended “they lifted me and threw me,” she said. “I was taken to the police station and treated like a blackfella.”



The woman was Jacinta’s mother, Bess Nungarrayi Price, a Warlpiri activist known for speaking out against domestic violence and for supporting the Howard government’s “intervention” in Aboriginal communities.



Two years later, as she ran for NT parliament, a journalist profiling her for The Weekend Australian magazine noted she had not mentioned racism in their time together. “I have never faced racism,” she told him. “Maybe once, in a clothing shop.”

Jacinta is in many ways her mother’s daughter. Both have won office as CLP politicians (Bess Price served one term, becoming a minister). Both have attacked Aboriginal leaders living in capital cities as out-of-touch “elites”. Both say the media is preoccupied with racism and that they are more likely to be racially vilified by other Aboriginal people. Price has called the insult ‘coconut’ – brown on the outside, white on the inside – an example of hate speech.



Price’s father, Dave, is another important influence. In his younger days, he was “a long-haired hippie who loved nothing more than tossing a backpack over his shoulder and heading off on his motorbike in whichever direction the wind was blowing”, the senator writes in her memoir.



These days, there’s little hippie left in Dave Price.



In a 2023 interview with Andrew Bolt, he called Aboriginal culture “particularly misogynist”. Writing for Quadrant in 2020, he demanded an apology from “Aboriginal ‘leaders’ who have convinced governments that the best we can do for these children is to leave them in the hellholes they die in as long as they are ‘on Country’, practice their ‘culture’ and speak their language”.



Dave Price had been a lifelong Labor voter, Jacinta has said, dating her family’s political conversion to the time of the 2007 NT Intervention. But years earlier, Dave was already in John Howard’s camp when it came to the “history wars” fought over colonisation and its legacy.

In 2001, Dave told the Alice Springs News that debate over the stolen generations – the removal of tens of thousands of Indigenous children from their families over decades – was being repressed.



“The complexities of the story aren’t aired,” he said. “Politicians and the press look for an Aboriginal point of view. It’s an absolute absurdity. We don’t say, what is the white point of view?”



In a 1999 essay, posted to the website of the cultural consultancy business he ran with Bess, he argued there was more to the stolen generations than “unrelenting and cruel injustice”.



“There were whitefellas involved who acted from the highest motives and did see themselves as rescuing children from intolerable circumstances,” he wrote. “We don’t hear enough from them.”



The benefactors

When Price’s parents flew to Canberra for their daughter’s maiden speech, they found themselves in powerful company. Gina Rinehart made an appearance in the Senate viewing box.



Australia’s richest person has since praised Price for “her endeavours to speak up for truth about marginalised Indigenous Australians”. Last year, Rinehart’s mining company, Hancock Prospecting, made its first donation to Price’s CLP in a decade, $75,000.



The admiration flows both ways. “A remarkable woman, a pioneer,” Price called Rinehart in a 2022 speech. In the same address, Price thanked Lachlan Murdoch “whose family have provided a beacon of light in a sea of woke darkness”. When News Corp celebrated The Australian’s 60th birthday, Price received free flights and accommodation to attend.



But according to her gift disclosures, her most generous benefactor is a retired UNSW maths professor.



James Franklin donated $15,000 to Price’s 2019 election campaign. He flew her family to Canberra to attend her maiden speech, twice covered her legal fees, and paid for her to attend a London conference.



Senator Price with her benefactor, retired mathematics professor James Franklin.

For nearly a decade, Franklin maintained an online project called The Australian Database of Indigenous Violence.



“I mean violence to Indigenous people but, as everybody can see, nearly all of it is by other Indigenous people,” he told The Australian in 2008. He said some in the “Aboriginal industry” would call it racist. “I agree it’s problematic to say in some sense that one community is worse than another, but that’s too bad. They are.”



Franklin later joined the board of the Bennelong Society, a now-defunct group devoted to right-wing thought on Aboriginal affairs, which had awarded Bess Price a medal in 2009.



“Indigenous issues, especially as talked about in the city, had a lot of bullshit talked about them,” Franklin says of this time. “I was on the lookout for someone who might be talking some more sense.”



Franklin, who also donated to Bess, describes the Prices as family friends. He has met Jacinta “several times”. But he says they don’t discuss Indigenous policy. “They say that in the end, it’s not policies imposed from outside that can do anything,” Franklin says. “It’s cultural change from the inside that is needed.”



The claims

Where Advance targets “ordinary Aussies”, Quadrant pursues an intellectual audience. For decades, the arch-conservative magazine has provided a platform to the opponents of Aboriginal self-determination.



Franklin sits on the board. Abbott is its chair.



This year, both men spoke at a memorial held for Quadrant editor Keith Windschuttle, who concluded “there were no stolen generations” in his 2002 book, The Fabrication of Aboriginal History.



In his eulogy, Abbott said: “Few, if any, Aboriginal children were removed other than for their own well-being, as best as that could be understood.”



It’s a conclusion at odds with the 1997 report to parliament Bringing Them Home, which found the removal policies amounted to a crime against humanity.

Analysis

Political leadership

Ley had little choice, but sacking Price could cost her

Price wrote for The Australian last year that “even when misguided policies are pursued, like those that befell the stolen generation, we find that, over time, the efforts to integrate proved more fruitful than policies of separation.”



She went on: “The records show many descendants of the stolen generations now enjoy greater prosperity and success than those generations who were simply neglected and left to live in poverty and squalor.”



By contrast, a 2021 Australian Institute of Health and Welfare study found descendants had worse health and finances than other Indigenous people. They were nearly twice as likely not to own their home.



Price has also argued that child protection authorities are leaving children in unsafe homes to avoid perceptions of new stolen generations.



Jacynta Krakouer, a Minang-Noongar woman and an Aboriginal Enterprise Fellow at the University of South Australia, strongly disagrees.



“The best interest of the child is a legal precedent in all states and territories,” Krakouer says. “And to state that Aboriginal children need to be removed more is an insult to all of the children that are being removed at incredibly high rates – rates that continue to climb year on year.”

According to her memoir, Price was the one who advised Advance to get involved in the Voice referendum. But it was Advance director, Stephen Doyle, over a coffee in Brisbane, who suggested Price and her family should front the campaign.



What followed was a nine-minute “documentary” featuring interviews with Price and her husband at home in Alice Springs. It opens with Price, perched on a boulder on Anzac Hill, as the sun dips behind the ranges in the distance.

Business Beginnings in Bahrain: A Real Experience\
I still remember my first morning at Bahrain Financial Harbour, coffee in hand, watching the city wake up. It’s a sight that blends ambition with tradition. To the east, the silver towers of Bahrain Bay reflect the sunlight; to the west, the bustling Seef District pulses with the rhythm of commerce. Anyone who’s started a business in Bahrain will tell you—the process isn’t just about paperwork. It’s about navigating vibrant souqs and gleaming boardrooms, understanding the rhythm of majlis meetings, and timing your filings outside Ramadan’s shorter hours.\
\
Tip: If you want to catch the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (MOICT) with no lines, aim for 10:15 am Tuesdays—right before the coffee service arrives.\
\
Amidst this dynamic environment, understanding LMRA registration is not just a regulatory hurdle but a strategic key—especially with recent 2025 reforms creating both opportunities and challenges.\
\

Why Bahrain? Current Economic Growth & Business Environment\
Bahrain continues to punch above its weight as the Gulf’s startup and SME launchpad. According to Reuters, the kingdom's GDP expanded by 3.7% in Q1 2025, outpacing broader GCC growth rates. New regulations have attracted over $1.6 billion in FDI in the first half of 2025 alone (Forbes Business). The government’s Vision 2030 remains laser-focused on sectors like fintech, logistics, and tourism.\
A recent Gulf News survey ranks Bahrain as the Gulf’s most startup-friendly jurisdiction, noting its pro-innovation stance and streamlined digital systems.\

LMRA Registration: The Heart of Bahrain’s Compliance System\
Every foreign- or Bahraini-owned company that intends to hire staff needs to deal with the Labour Market Regulatory Authority (LMRA). This agency governs the employment of expatriates, ensures workforce compliance, and tracks all labor-related activities.\
What Does LMRA Registration Involve?\
\
Creating an LMRA Account on the Sijilat or LMRA portal\
Linking your Commercial Registration (CR) number to your entity\
Providing detailed company, shareholder, and manager data\
Subscribing to mandatory worker insurance\
Pre-registering intended foreign workers and obtaining work visas\
\
\
Insider Tip: You can synchronize Sijilat and LMRA registration steps to cut days off your timeline. Preload all scanned documents (passport copies, tenancy contracts, CR, etc.) in your digital folder—most delays come from missing attachments.\

Alt text: Business process and documentation. prefer to see an active LMRA registration before opening a full business account.\
When Exactly Is LMRA Registration Required?\
\
Upon company formation if any staff will be employed\
Prior to work visa applications for expatriates\
When expanding or changing business structure to add new roles or activities (especially post-2025 rule update)\
If accessing Tamkeen wage support or training grants\
\
And here’s a nuance new entrepreneurs miss: Even “virtual offices” or flexi-desk CRs in Bahrain Bay require LMRA records if you want to sponsor staff (I learned this when scaling my consultancy).\
For the full registration process, reference bahrain-company-formation-process.\
\
How LMRA Registration Fits into Bahrain Company Formation\
LMRA is only one piece of the puzzle. Here’s how it connects with the wider compliance ecosystem:\
\
MOICT (Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Tourism): Handles business licensing/Sijilat portal\
EDB (Economic Development Board): Sector-specific support and FDI pathways\
LMRA: Employment and labor market compliance\
Tamkeen: Funding and Bahraini workforce support\
\
Surprisingly, LMRA’s digital migration in 2025 has reduced in-person visits by 65%. But, if you do need to visit, Diplomatic Area branches are typically faster than Seef, especially outside peak hours.\
Business Structures and LMRA Implications\
Certain company types have special LMRA requirements—for example:\
- WLL (With Limited Liability): Must register all managers and at least one responsible shareholder\
- BSC Closed/Public: Must submit board member data during registration\
- Branches of Foreign Companies: Need parent company due diligence docs translated and notarized\
(When I set up a foreign-owned BSC Closed in 2023, the notarized board minutes took over three weeks—now, notarized digital uploads are accepted for most nationalities, cutting this down to a few days.)\
Check out Bahrain business type structures for more on choosing your legal entity.\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration.)\
- Quicker Digital Verification: Sijilat and LMRA data-sharing enables instant verification for most nationalities (exceptions: North Korea, sanctioned states).\
- Mandatory Wage Protection (WPS) Integration: All registered companies must now submit payroll records via LMRA portal monthly; fail to comply and you’ll face instant fines (starting at BHD 100 per infraction).\
A common mistake: Entrepreneurs often miss the WPS wage upload deadline. Use local HR tech tools like PayZero or Tamkeen Payroll, which automatically sync your payroll uploads to LMRA on your behalf.\
\
Step-by-Step Guidance: How to Register with LMRA\
Here’s the process, fine-tuned through my own trial and error:\
\
Secure Your Commercial Registration (CR) via Sijilat.\
Prepare required documentation:\
Valid CR\
Copy of tenancy agreement (even for flexi-desk)\
Shareholder IDs/passports (scan all pages)\
Board resolution (for BSCs/branches)\
Digital photo of office entrance (don’t skip—inspectors often check it matches your CR address)\
Create LMRA company account at portal.lmra.bh.\
Upload required documents and link your Sijilat CR.\
Pay initial processing fees (typically BHD 50-200 depending on entity type).\
Await digital inspection/approval (1–5 working days).\
Once approved, apply for staff work visas or begin WPS wage uploads.\
\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation..\
- Use Bahraini witnesses when notarizing documents; it’s cheaper and recognized instantly by LMRA.\
- Schedule your initial application in early morning slots to avoid post-prayer surges (Ramadan exception: mid-afternoon is best).\
Example: Avoiding a Common Pitfall\
A common rookie mistake? Submitting a tenancy contract with a mismatched address. (I fell into this trap—required a resubmission, delaying my setup by a week.) Double-check your Sijilat-registered office address matches exactly with your tenancy document. If you’re unsure, ask your landlord for the municipality-issued lease template, which is always accepted.\
For support, see professional business support and consultation.\
\
Alt text: Professional business support.\
- Work visa per expatriate worker: BHD 215–325 (payable before visa processing)\
- Monthly LMRA levy: BHD 10–20 per employee\
- Mandatory insurance: Typically BHD 50–85 annually per worker\
- Document preparation/notarization: BHD 30–60 (if using professional service)\
Budget for at least BHD 400–700 upfront for a small consulting or trading entity, more if you plan to hire multiple staff.\

Monthly wage uploads (WPS)\
Renewal of work visas before expiration\
Insurance renewals\
Employee status updates (resignations, terminations, new hires)\
Maintaining accurate company and contact data\
\
Mistakes here attract fines. For example, late wage uploads can lead to BHD 100+ penalties per incident.\
A personal aside: I once missed a staff status update over Eid holidays and got flagged for a compliance audit. Now, I set calendar reminders for all key dates—and recommend everyone do the same.\
For outsourced compliance help, visit accounting and bookkeeping services in Bahrain.\
\
Bahrain vs UAE or Saudi: A Brief Comparison\
UAE’s MOHRE system and KSA’s Qiwa platform feel more bureaucratic and less transparent than Bahrain’s LMRA/Sijilat combo. Bahrain’s digital-first approach and minimal sponsorship requirements make it faster and less expensive for new entrepreneurs—especially post-2025 reforms. And, Bahrain’s authorities are surprisingly open to direct negotiation in person (especially during majlis coffee sessions), something less common across the causeway.\
For sectors with 99% foreign ownership, see Bahrain’s foreign ownership guide. For those wanting trade in tax-free zones, Bahrain free zones can mean big savings—no surprise they attracted 1,200+ new SMEs in 2025 alone.\
\
A Tangent: Why Good Coffee Can Win You Faster Approvals\
This might sound odd, but investing in quality traditional coffee service for your offices or meetings—especially during Ramadan or peak inspection season—often loosens bureaucratic knots. Inspectors and ministry officials appreciate the gesture, and I’ve seen it turn a routine check into an opportunity for relationship-building. In Bahrain business culture, respect for tradition and hospitality is more than courtesy; it’s a strategic asset.\
\
Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them\
\
Documentation mismatches: Always double-check address and shareholder names against Sijilat records.\
Missing WPS uploads: Use automated payroll services.\
Late visa renewals: Set recurring reminders.\
Assuming local agents handle compliance: Take charge—many agents only do the basics.\
\
\
Recommended Resources and Service Providers\
From experience, KeyLink Bahrain provides the most reliable, end-to-end support. Their bilingual consultants know which branch to visit, who to contact, and even when to suggest a majlis-style meeting to smooth things over. For government regulations, Bahrain.com is your official source.\
\
Practical FAQ: Bahrain LMRA Registration\
1. What documents do I need for LMRA registration?\
\
Valid Commercial Registration (CR) certificate\
Tenancy agreement\
Shareholder/director passport copies (all nationalities)\
Board resolution (if BSC or branch)\
Municipality lease (for address verification)\
Office entrance photo\
\
For streamlined submission tips, see company formation in Bahrain.\
2. What does LMRA registration cost in 2025?\
Expect BHD 400–700 for a small entity, including:\
- Initial fees: BHD 50–150\
- Work visa: BHD 215–325/employee\
- Insurance: BHD 50–85/employee per year\
For breakdowns, check Bahrain company formation cost.\
3. When is LMRA registration not required?\
\
When you have no employees or only shareholders working as directors/officers.\
If forming an entity solely for passive investment (still check with MOICT for sector exceptions).\
\
4. How long does LMRA approval take?\
\
1–5 working days if documents are complete and address matches.\
Fastest processing at Diplomatic Area branch with early morning appointments.\
\
5. What happens if I miss WPS or other compliance requirements?\
Fines starting at BHD 100 per infraction. Avoid this by using payroll management tools or outsourcing to a reliable compliance provider: accounting and bookkeeping services in Bahrain.\

It’s incredible how much noise pollution the electric train horns create in comparison to the previous trains—which I never heard in 30 years. 

This noise pollution is a blight on the city. I’m sure it reduces property values for everyone within hearing range. 

This is not about safety at all. All of the intersections have loud bells that precede the train for quite a long time, plus gates. This is about trying to force communities to spend an enormous amount of money grade-separating all of the crossings. ",0,1757714466.0,SanMateo,2,0.22,False

Some of you might remember me from a while back when [I posted about my wife’s café photography project](https://www.reddit.com/r/saintpaul/comments/1kat8at/this_community_helped_shine_a_light_on_my_wifes/). No worries if you don’t—it’s been a bit 😅.


Fast forward to now, and she’s the Artist of the Month at Claddagh Coffee! Her photography is hanging on the walls there, and prints are available for $25 and $45. [Check it out!](https://www.instagram.com/p/DOGz_U5EXgZ/?img_index=1)


If you’re grabbing coffee sometime this month, I’d love if you checked out her wall and maybe took a piece home. Supporting local artists in small ways like this makes a huge difference.

|
Dave (Male, mid 20’s; full script contains ~2,000 words) - Dave is suave and cocky, he’s your cubicle neighbor and bothers you incessantly; telling you how terrible you look as if it’s a compliment. He loves himself more than anything in the world and thinks others should love him like that too.

Sample line: ""I don't date coworkers... Unless you're that madly obsessed with me, which I mean, hey... who could blame you, right?""
|
Shannon (Female, mid 30’s to early 40’s; full script contains ~750 words) - The assistant manager at SOUP, she’s got a deeper voice for a woman and a no nonsense attitude. She’s the voice of reason in the office and also acts as the tutorial for each new mechanic the player unlocks

|
Fawn Sarabell (Female, early 20’s; script incomplete, expected 750-1000 words) - Fawn works as a barista at the local coffee shop. This character has two distinct tones and may be cast separately for each.

Her customer service voice is high and sweet, oozing with cute feminine charm to try to squeeze tips from customers whenever she can.

Customer service sample line: “Hey there! Welcome to the Average Joe’s Cuppa Joe! Where our joe is made with mo’! How can I help you?”

Outside of work, her voice is brash and cold, a reflection of her troubled childhood and financial woes brought on by the big city.

|
Betty Buyer (Female, late 60’s to early 70’s; script incomplete, expecting 750 - 1000 words) - Betty sounds like she’s smoked a pack a day since she was twelve… because she has.

“For sure, boss… not too opposed at all…”
|
Brick (Male, mid 30’s; full script contains ~100 words) - The dumb muscle of our mobster trio, his IQ is probably lower than the building material he’s named after. Brick speaks in a slow and confused deep voice, like every word he says is a question and every thing he hears is nonsensical.

Sample line: “We ain’t actually gonna be doing any protecting though… are we? I thought we was here to extort and threaten, boss…?”
|
Big Tony (Male, late 40’s; full script contains ~400 words) - Big Tony is the leader of the mobster trio, he stands at about 3 feet tall and is as stocky as a cheese wheel. The man has a stereotypical Italian American/Brooklyn style accent.

1nffztk,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nffztk/i_work_in_a_247_diner_last_nights_customers/,I Work in a 24/7 Diner. Last night’s customers weren’t human.,"You know how it only takes a few small accidents to make you homeless?  An emergency expense here. A couple of overdraft fees there. A rent check that bounced because of the fees. And an eviction notice that happened because of the bounce. I went from stable - albeit not wealthy - to sleeping in my car within 4 weeks. And I count myself lucky. At least I have a car.

And a job. Which is why I have this story.

I work the overnight shift at an all night diner. Maybe you’ve heard of it, maybe you haven’t. They never close. They’re always hiring. And they don’t really care about your background.

It was the quiet hours, when the time is so late, it’s early. The diner was empty so I was leaning against the counter eating a bowl of chili with shredded cheese and chopped onion while I scrolled for other jobs on my phone.

The cook was outside having a smoke, and the only other person in the diner with me was a young pregnant girl named Sheree, who was texting her grandmother nervously. 

“I’m gonna have to leave early. My grandma is telling me I need to come get my child. I hate when she does this, but I can’t afford a babysitter either.”

Sheree was cool.  But like everyone else here, she was having a rough time. Her boyfriend was in the prison 60 miles down the road, and part of why she worked here was to fill his accounts and have enough money for regular visits. He was there for murder or something, but we don’t really talk about our personal lives so I wasn’t sure.

Brucius was the cook, and he took a smoke break at every available opportunity which, when the restaurant was empty, meant a lot of opportunity. He’d wander back if a customer walked in, but there was no reason to bother him.

“Hey, it’s not a problem. I’ll handle everything. Go pick up your kid.”

“Thank you! You’re a lifesaver! I owe you!”

“Don’t worry about it. I’ll see you Wednesday.”

She ran out the door, and I didn’t think anything of it. I heard her say goodbye to Brucius and then her car engine grind as she drove away.

I had another 4 hours left on my shift and, with any luck, it would stay this quiet.

Of course, since I’m here talking to you, you know I wasn’t so lucky.

The door dinged and a family of 4 walked in: mom, dad, boy, and girl. My eyes flicked to the parking lot. I didn’t see a car, but I just told myself they could have parked behind the building. 

It’s funny, but I don’t remember what they looked like. However, I do remember what they wore because it was some real Leave It to Beaver Andy Griffith type shit.

The dad had on a blue plaid button up shirt with a white undershirt beneath, and khaki trousers. His hair was perfectly slicked back, like one of those old Brylcreem ads. The mom wore a red gingham check dress with a wide skirt, crinoline, and cinched waist. Her hair too was impeccable, straight out of an old Betty Crocker commercial. The little girl had her hair in two pigtails anointed with yellow bows and was wearing a pink shirt and blue shorts. The boy had a perfect cowlick and wore a blue shirt and red shorts.

I felt unsettled. They looked perfect, but they felt wrong. Brucius came back inside, took one long look at the family as they settled into a booth, then went through the swinging doors into the back without a word. Rude.

“Good evening, y’all,” I said as I set down the  laminated menus. “Can I get you anything to drink?” 

Each member of the family clasped their hands over their menu, and turned in my direction with a smile. 

“Four glasses of milk, please,” said the Dad, his tone folksy, like something out of an old sitcom.

“Everything looks so delicious,” said the Mom cheerily, without glancing at the menu. 

I couldn’t remember the last time I’d seen adults order milk, especially at such a late hour. 

“Thank you,” the Dad said when I set their glasses down. No one had moved one centimeter, their posture and faces in the same position as they watched me pour their beverages and return. 

I wiped my hands on my apron, and attempted a smile, “Are you all ready to order?”

The four of them glanced towards my name tag in unison, and I was suddenly glad most of it was hidden beneath my hoodie.

“We’re waiting for someone,” said the mom in a sing-song voice. They all turned to face either other, small, identical smiles on their faces, condensation from their untouched glasses making four tiny puddles. 

It wasn’t right for children to be that quiet. Or for anyone to be that still. To be honest, it wasn’t normal to wait for someone at that hour either.

I pretended to wipe down the counters. Guests weren’t supposed to be left alone, and I didn’t know what to do. 

“Are you sure I can’t bring you anything?” I asked after a couple distressingly silent minutes.

“We told you, we’re waiting,” one of the children hissed. I startled and dropped the rag. That wasn’t a child’s voice.

All four sets of eyes again fixated on me, but this time, no one was smiling. My heartbeat rushed in my ears, and I could have sworn they heard it too. 

“Okay!” I laughed nervously, my voice a little too high. 

Abruptly, out the corner of my eye, I saw Brucius waving frantically behind the swinging doors, gesturing for me to join him in the back.

Relieved to have an excuse to leave, I backed away slowly, something deep in my most primal brain telling me not to turn my back to them. Rules be damned, I couldn’t be out there alone with them a second longer. 

I’d barely opened the swinging doors when he jerked me all the way in.

“Listen,” he whispered urgently, his grip tight on my arm. “Those people out there aren’t real people.”

I looked back through the small window in the swinging door, “I don’t…”

He interrupted me, “What I don’t have is time to explain. You see that bag of salt?” He jerked his head towards a giant-size bag of pure rock salt I’d somehow never seen since working here.

“Pour a line at the front. Make sure it’s far enough back that the swinging door won’t break the line. It needs to go all the way from one wall to the other. Pour extra if you’re not sure.”

“I’m confused….”

“And I’m scared shitless. Pour.”

He hefted his own large bag of salt and began making a wide circle, one large enough to fit us both. Looking behind him, I could see there was already a similar salt line at the back, stretching from wall to wall.

I had no idea what was happening, but I’d never seen Brucius be anything other than laid back and chill my entire time here. And that was enough to get me to listen.

As I poured, I took a peek through the round window in the swinging doors and spotted the family still sitting there. They still hadn’t moved. 

“This is really fucking creepy,” I muttered under my breath.

Once my line of salt had been poured and double-checked, Brucius pointed to the inside of the circle and pressed a finger to his lips. 

Tiptoeing to the wall, he carefully opened the circuit box. Then, taking a deep breath, he switched off the breakers, plunging the entire restaurant into darkness and turning off the lights outside. In the next instant, he’d leapt to join me in the middle of the circle.

One heartbeat later, I heard the most ungodly shrieking from the dining area. I clamped my hands over my ears, but it didn’t help. It was like the sound waves were made of broken glass. My skin felt like it was being peeled off. My eardrums screamed. I started to fall over, and stopped abruptly only partway down. Brucius had twisted the collar of my shirt around his hand. I’d almost fallen outside the circle. Another shriek rolled over me and I sobbed in confusion and pain. My muscles clenched into knots as I fought an instinctive urge to run. Brucius’ grip tightened, keeping me grounded. 

Just then, the swinging doors blasted open, and a roiling inky mass slithered and slopped its way inside. You’d think it would be too dark to see anything, but there were so many mouths…so many teeth…so many eyes… The space filled with the scent of rot and tar. 

This was the “family.”

I retched and clamped my hands over my mouth to keep the vomit down. 

The mass glided and spilled its way up to the very edge of the salt line, and stretched horizontally along its entire length. I understood why there was a circle now. If there’d been the slightest gap in the line or between the line and the wall, it’d have slithered its way across.

My eyes burned the longer I looked. I felt something warm drop onto my hand. I thought it was tears. It was a nosebleed.

As the screams ratcheted higher, Bruce shouted, “Close your eyes!” I clamped my hands over my ears, screwed my eyes shut, and sobbed.

Eventually - I don’t know how long - the screaming stopped. I must have passed out right after because when I came to, it was dawn. 

Every muscle and bone in my body ached when I stood up. My face was crusted with dried tears, snot, and blood. Brucius was red-eyed and bedraggled. He was using the special broom - the one that said, “Do Not Use” in sharpie on the handle to sweep all the salt into a large dustpan with the same directive. The salt had turned a smoky blue and smelled like sulfur and gasoline. 

Perhaps it was the daylight, perhaps it was surviving the single most terrifying night of my life, but when I spoke, my voice was surprisingly calm, even though it sounded like I’d chewed and swallowed broken glass. 

“I’m going to wash my face. Then I’m going to make us coffee. And then you’re going to tell me what the hell that was.”

He nodded, mumbled, “Yeah,” and kept sweeping.

I was half tempted to turn the sign at the door to closed, but it would just my luck if the manager appeared out of nowhere when I did. Besides, the place was empty.

Once he was done sweeping, he washed his hands, and joined me. I poured him a mug of the best coffee I’ve ever tasted in my life. He lit up a cigarette, and we looked at each other across an empty table. 

Despite the commotion, the diner was in perfect order, like nothing had ever happened. 

“What was that?”

He took a long drag, as though toying with telling me the truth or not. But after last night, it was too late to lie.

“They’re called The Family. I never seen them before, but Carrie - the waitress before you and Sheree - worked here for a few years and said they show up every once in awhile.”

He paused as if expecting me to say something. I took a long sip, and he kept on.

“The first clue was they didn’t have a car. They just appeared, I don’t even know from where, and walked in. The second is how they were dressed.”

“Where did they come from?”

“I don’t know, but the lore is a family disappeared on the highway decades ago and when they came back they were…that.”

“And y’all didn’t think to tell me this when I got hired?”

“Would you have believed it?”

“I guess not.”

“There’s a reason the pay is so good.”

“What about the salt? The lights?”

“Listen…I don’t know all the rules and she didn’t either, but before this place was built, apparently there were a lot more disappearances. People would get off at this exit because they thought they saw a sign for food or gas, take a turn, and never be seen again.”

“But now…”

“Now, people just stop here. Right off the highway and right back on. But that means when the family gets hungry…”

“They come here.”

“Yeah.”

“That’s why you went straight to the back?”

“Yeah, I needed to get started.“

“And you turned off the light so no one stops while they’re here?”

“Yeah.”

“What about the salt?”

He went quiet. “You saw why.”

At that moment, the door opened, and a couple with a toddler entered. A real family. Oblivious.

We stopped talking. I took their order and Brucius heated up the grill. There was nothing else to do.

This happened a few weeks ago, but I’m still working there. Corporate gave us an extra bonus check when the incident was reported, which got me in a cheap hotel with a decent bed and shower for a little while. I’m still applying for jobs, but no one else has called me back for an interview. I’m alive because of Brucius, but he was just hired as a Corrections Officer at the prison and is leaving soon.

I might delete this later, but I needed to share it with someone, where no one would know who I was or judge me. What do you think I should do? ",2,1757713824.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Sample line: ""Let's see... No past experience... No special skills... And your cover letter is the word please repeated seventy four times... Perfect! You're hired!""
|
Dave (Male, mid 20’s; full script contains ~2,000 words) - Dave is suave and cocky, he’s your cubicle neighbor and bothers you incessantly; telling you how terrible you look as if it’s a compliment. He loves himself more than anything in the world and thinks others should love him like that too.

Sample line: ""I don't date coworkers... Unless you're that madly obsessed with me, which I mean, hey... who could blame you, right?""
|
Shannon (Female, mid 30’s to early 40’s; full script contains ~750 words) - The assistant manager at SOUP, she’s got a deeper voice for a woman and a no nonsense attitude. She’s the voice of reason in the office and also acts as the tutorial for each new mechanic the player unlocks

|
Jeff (Male, early 20’s; full script contains ~80 words) - The office’s conspiracy nut. High pitched and manic voice, think Tweak from South Park with a slightly deeper register. He makes noises of panic amidst his wild claims.

Sample line: “*Panicky noise* You don’t know that!!! The cup on the floor could be a spy tool to take us down from the inside! I bet it’s listening to this. Very. Conversation…”
|
Fawn Sarabell (Female, early 20’s; script incomplete, expected 750-1000 words) - Fawn works as a barista at the local coffee shop. This character has two distinct tones and may be cast separately for each.

Her customer service voice is high and sweet, oozing with cute feminine charm to try to squeeze tips from customers whenever she can.

Customer service sample line: “Hey there! Welcome to the Average Joe’s Cuppa Joe! Where our joe is made with mo’! How can I help you?”

Outside of work, her voice is brash and cold, a reflection of her troubled childhood and financial woes brought on by the big city.

Regular sample line: “Hey, do you mind if I smoke? I’m gonna do it anyway but I wanted to ask… my moms raised me to be polite like that.”
|
Richard Gulp (Male, late 20’s; full script contains ~750 words) - Richard is a nerd and the owner of the local comic shop. He lives in his mom’s basement and sees no issue with this at all.

|
Betty Buyer (Female, late 60’s to early 70’s; script incomplete, expecting 750 - 1000 words) - Betty sounds like she’s smoked a pack a day since she was twelve… because she has. The woman is made of sass, lung cancer, and plastic hair curlers that she wears so often they may actually be part of her hair…

Sample line: “Oh, honey… at MY age? You don’t go on dates, no no no… You and your husband sit on the couch and watch reruns of the office for the seventieth time because he thinks it’s your favorite show and you don’t have the heart to tell him you’re more of a Friends gal…”

“For sure, boss… not too opposed at all…”
|
Brick (Male, mid 30’s; full script contains ~100 words) - The dumb muscle of our mobster trio, his IQ is probably lower than the building material he’s named after. Brick speaks in a slow and confused deep voice, like every word he says is a question and every thing he hears is nonsensical.

Sample line: “We ain’t actually gonna be doing any protecting though… are we? I thought we was here to extort and threaten, boss…?”
|
Big Tony (Male, late 40’s; full script contains ~400 words) - Big Tony is the leader of the mobster trio, he stands at about 3 feet tall and is as stocky as a cheese wheel. The man has a stereotypical Italian American/Brooklyn style accent.

I just go to coffee shops and read. But I still want to be able to communicate effectively and order and understand deep conversations when i do meet people I click with.

1nffutr,https://www.reddit.com/r/LaPavoniLovers/comments/1nffutr/europicolla_only_ever_tastes_sour/,Europicolla Only ever tastes sour.,"Hi all, I'm a new europicola owner and iu have become in love with the style and design of this thing but cant seem to beat this overpowering and undrinkable sour flavour.  
This is my first espresso machine ever and first grinder so i paired it with a DF54 Grinder and  am using horsham coffee's ""Workhorse blend"". My europicola is a 51mm basket post Millenia 2A machine. However i am yet to get a nice dialled in shot from this. I fully cleaned the entire machine including replacing the boiler connector as it disintegrated in my hands, I also descaled and flushed everything out rigorously.  
I have tried courser with a hard tamp, i have tried very fine with a softer tamp, i have tried many in the middle of those two. my tamp looks level and my dose is 13grams. My puck usually looks like its been through a good extraction when i remove the portafilter (Although i cant see the extraction due to the standard double spout portafilter - my bottomless arrives tomorrow-).  
But to no avail it always comes out tasting like hot lemon juice. Even if extracted with nice resistance and good time  always the same sour flavour really, even when the crema is more or less its the same sour flavour. I have tried the group head temps (using the stickers) from between 85 - 95, but again no noticeable difference. 

A few things i have noted as potential culprits and was wondering if there is any evidence this might be the case:

Low boiler pressure: my boiler only ever gets to 0.5 bar and then turns off even if i release ""false pressure"", will tweaking the pressure stat until 1 bar make any difference to this?

Potentially leaking gasket: When the lever is down during boiling there are drops that come though the shower screen but once i lift the lever a few cm it stops, i don't know if this is a gasket leak (piston sleeve or group head) or if this is a piston volume thingy with the adjustable nuts at the top. Would just replacing all the gaskets in the group head be suitable?

Grinding: As i said before i haevg grinded quite fine, almost to the point of stalling, but it was like the same flabour as my courser grind, and ive grinded all inbetween that.

Puck prep: Ive heard la pavoni puck prep can be meticulous, i hope the bottomless portafilter will help me to see the potential issues, My tamper doesnt fit 100% in the 51mm but more like 96% could this be an issue with channeling?

Any advice on this would be very helpful, im so lost and dont want to be infinitley using beans, will update more when the bottomless comes and when torx screw to change pressure stat comes

I supported him financially since the start always promising the next job will change everything. All my credit cards maxed out is when his mask started slipping. With time and him barely working and me supporting us he became worse and worse when I couldn’t just swipe a card and us be good. 
He was horrible this summer. Threats fighting constantly would ask me to run errands then go insane I wasn’t home while doing errands. I have scares things broken and destroyed. I did everything for him trying to keep him happy. Weekend before he left he’d started a new job on Wednesday. Weekend constant hate while I was at work. I stopped reading the walls of text he begged for money and was enraged I didn’t have it. More walls of text. He threatened to leave me said he was packing no uncommon. Then apologized and told me how he loved me. I found a way to send the money. The next morning I woke up early went to make him coffee and start making his lunch I went to bring him his coffee and he refused to go to work. I cried and begged him. Just kept saying I can’t do this anymore and he has to he went insane screaming yelling said he was leaving. He went into other room grabbing things I just cried begging him to go to work he rushed in hitting me in head with bag he had packed from day before. I started telling him to leave over and over he was in other room grabbing at his things then came in punching me in back of head and face. I told him to get out I bought everything to just get out over and I grabbed his pocket knife on table and sat in bed repeating myself. Seeing me with the knife he said he’d slit my throat. I told him to leave or I’m calling the police. He went insane screaming yelling to hit me again and told me too. I ran downstairs to grab my phone where I left it on counter to make his lunch. As I dialed he came downstairs hitting me in back of head as hard as he could with his shoe. And left for the next few hours I got horrible messages on and off. I did all the police stuff charges PPO all that I told his mom who lives nearby she try’s but she’s scared of him. I told his ex who though he always said horrible things about her she gets steady pay from being born with a disease 2 of the 3 kids are fully disabled and she gets money for them along with pay for being there full time care worker for them. I felt like though he always hated her she cheated on him he wanted that easy life again money and someone there all day to be to ere for him. I warned her worried for her. She just said she was shocked thought we were happy together. Monday 5am he left me in Michigan next morning he was in Florida with her. He didn’t get there on the $30 I went him on Sunday so he stole from me and my family or she gave him money. I warned  her brother as I did her and said the fact he was there is dangerous. I sent the texts I never read over weekend now read him telling me I’m lucky he stab the bitch talking about my mother who lets us live rent free he then said sorry that was to much and that he missed his daughter and he’s going to kidnap her. Sent him all the terrible things I sent his sister but she didn’t seem to care. Messaging him was my last ditch effort there best friends he actually introduced my ex with the mother of his daughter. He was supposed to be the best man at are wedding. He read it said he’d keep eye out. A month later she messaged asking about everything that it isn’t adding up with what he is saying I told her everything again sent the scream shots from that weekend and more from farther back where he’s telling me how he loves me and how beautiful I am then cursing and yelling at me. We talked on and off for one day she told me he tried sexting her while he was still here with me I wasn’t surprised I knew he was planning to escape for something with more cash and he’d always talked about her always loving him and being a slut for him. She said she didn’t want him and never wanted him back that she’s kind of scared. Brought up how he nearly killed her dad in a fight. I told her I know he brought it up all the time boasting about how strong and brutal he is.  She said she was scared specifically about her kids. That she was going to have her brother go with her to turn him into police. I got a message from a not friend on Facebook it was his father’s name and a picture of his father he took.  His father hates him wouldn’t answer his call on Father’s Day.  Telling me to fuck off we’re done he’s leaving me alone.  
He broke the PPO he’s a horrible monster and should be locked up he’s nearly killed FIL with barehands and was proud.  Should I leave it he’s across the country. But I’ll always have those scares he leached at least $30,000 and he he has charges against him for that final attack  but I just don’t know and know one really knows everything should I report it he was just telling me to leave him alone.

I get plenty of sleep and eat pretty well. I got some iron supplements with vitamin c to try just to see if it helps then I will know I am iron deficient. If they don't help, then I'm out $10 and I'll try to get checked out soon. Literally everything feels like such a chore, but oddly enough the only way I feel alright is to stay super busy. I feel like my heart does beat pretty hard a lot of the time, but I don't experience some of the other symptoms like pale skin. I get really shaky when I don't eat and my vision gets blurry. I occasionally (like once a month) get a headache that starts behind my eyes and leads to my whole body feeling terrible and needing to lie down for a while. Having caffeine in the mornings makes me feel terrible and ruins my day, but having coffee when I get home from work gives me a little energy to stay awake and play with the kids and help out around the house. It's impossible to stay awake if I sit down and read or watch TV or something like that in the afternoons and evenings. Like I said earlier I just have to stay busy to feel ok. One thing that has helped was switching to protein oatmeal with less sugar for breakfast. 
What do you guys think? Does it sound like I am anemic and the iron supplements will help? I literally never go to the doctor and where my wife and kids go I can't get in til next July, but I can go somewhere else if this doesn't help.

My breath plumed in front of me as I navigated the usual cracks in the pavement, heading for the 7:45 AM bus. Same route, same time, same vague sense of unease that had become a constant companion these past few years. You just knew things were different, even if you couldn't quite put your finger on how.



I was almost at the stop, already picturing the lukewarm coffee waiting for me at my desk, when he appeared. Just... there. A white man, nondescript in a way that made him instantly conspicuous – mid-thirties, clean-cut, a generic grey jacket that looked like it had been chosen by an algorithm. He moved with an unsettling fluidity, stepping directly into my path, a wide, almost too-friendly smile stretching across his face.



""Morning, pal!"" he boomed, extending his hand, palm open, fingers slightly curled, ready for a dap.



My internal alarm bells, long accustomed to subtle nudges, blared. I’d seen enough of the world, read enough between the lines, to know that unsolicited friendliness from strangers, especially ones who looked like they’d just stepped out of a highly paid focus group, was rarely benign. I stiffened, my own hand remaining firmly in my pocket.



""Just heading to work,"" I mumbled, trying to sidestep him.



He didn't budge. His smile didn’t falter, but something in his eyes shifted – a flicker of something clinical, almost impatient. ""No worries, just wanted to say hi. Beautiful day, isn't it? Heard the markets are finally turning around.""



He wasn't trying to dap me up anymore, but he kept his hand loosely by his side, almost as if he’d forgotten it was there. I watched it, wary, my gaze darting between his unblinking eyes and that hand. He continued to chatter, an innocuous stream of current events and weather observations, all delivered with that same unsettling cheer. Every fibre of my being screamed wrong. My suspicion, a finely honed instrument these days, hummed with a low, insistent thrum.



I tried to focus on the bus stop ahead, willing the 7:45 to appear, to provide a distraction, an escape. My gaze drifted for a fraction of a second, just enough to catch the faint shimmer of the bus's windshield in the distance. And that’s when he got me.



It was so quick, so subtle, I barely registered it. A light tap, a feather-light poke, right on my upper left shoulder. The same hand, the one that had been offered for a dap, the one he’d held casually by his side. It felt like nothing, a momentary pressure that I dismissed as an accidental brush, a slight jostle in his performative friendliness. He chuckled, clapped my shoulder (the other shoulder, this time), and then, just as quickly as he'd appeared, he melted away, fading into the flow of morning commuters as the bus pulled up.



I got on, heart still thrumming with residual unease, dismissing the encounter as another weird city moment. Just another strange interaction in a world that felt increasingly off-kilter.



It wasn’t until I was home, hours later, unwinding from the day, that I noticed it. A faint, almost imperceptible itch on my left shoulder. I reached up, rubbing idly. It felt… funny. Not painful, not a rash, just a strange, deep-seated sensation, like a tiny knot under the skin.



I pulled off my shirt and squinted at the spot in the bathroom mirror. Nothing obvious. I turned, trying to get a better angle. Still nothing. I went about my evening, the sensation a minor, nagging irritation.



Then, about an hour later, as I was making dinner, a new feeling bloomed. A distinct, low throb, and when I touched it again, there was a slight puffiness. A small, subtle swelling, maybe half an inch across, warm to the touch.



My heart began to hammer. The memory of the strange man, the extended hand, the insistent conversation, the subtle poke – it all flooded back with chilling clarity. I rushed back to the mirror, pulling the light closer.



With my 20/20 vision, sharpened by years of scrutinizing everything for hidden meaning, I leaned in, closer, closer still. And there it was. Just above the slight swelling, almost perfectly centered, was a pinprick. A minuscule, perfectly circular hole, no bigger than the tip of a sewing needle. It was clean, precise, and utterly terrifying.



A cold dread spread through me, colder than the September morning. Every instinct I had, every shred of paranoia that had been carefully cultivated by the world around me, screamed its confirmation. My breath hitched. I knew instantly.



The government. They finally got me.

No idea who the band was or what the song was. They were white guys (sorta Beastie Boys-ish) and I remember they were walking through a city at night rapping in maybe German or Danish. Every once in a while they would all look into the camera and say something that sounded like, “Ah hootah, hootah!” Seems like there was a split screen in the corner with a guy stomping around a coffee table wearing only underwear.

The problem is that today I looked at my car from my window. I live in an apartment at the 5th floor and the car is parked in front of my flat. Having my phone in hand I saw the headlights lighting up. It seems the car can detect my phone from such a large range as Ford states that this is possible from up to 40m/130ft.

For now I removed my phone as a key.

Has anyone else got similar experiences? Is there something one can do to prevent this kind of long range unlocks?
And if not, is this feature really something people should use? Thinking of situations when parking/charging at highway stations with luggage on board that can be stolen while the owner buys a coffee.

1nfff3z,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nfff3z/my_sad_life/,my sad life,"Hi. I'm 23 years old. For my whole life, it's been a meaningless, sad slog. I have no friends. I mean, none. My only contact with various people is through Reddit, and work. But I'm usually far too introverted and insecure to talk to anyone my age at my work. I live at home with my mum, who's pretty elderly now. My older brother has a family, a wife, 2 kids, and is currently in a 'bro relationship' with his daughter's boyfriend. They get along so well, he invited them along with them on a 3 week trip to Florida. I wasn't asked if I wanted to come. It doesn't bother me. My brother and me have nothing in common, and have different fathers. I've never felt like he's been an actual brother to me. We have a 15 year age gap.

My mornings usually consist of going to a coffee place with my mum and dogs, and then if I'm not working, just doing general sad lonely guy things like watching TV, playing Xbox or PC games, reading a book, or comic books. Browsing Reddit. Watching porn. I have tried to buy a weight bench and get fit, but I get disinterested. My physique is normal. I'm tall and lean.

I have tried getting up the courage to approach women. I saw a cute worker in a spa in the hotel where my mum works. I stood there for ages trying to work up the courage to just tell ask if she's single. I couldn't do it. I felt sick. I am a virgin obviously. I was made fun of in high school for being weird and creepy. I became the but of alot of jokes. i tried to laugh it off, but I got depressed with it. I have a memory of sitting on a bench. Another kid came up to a bench me and my 'friends' were sitting at, and says 'You know, it's funny how all you guys have rumours about you, but they're not true. Except the one about \[my name\] being a child molester'. Yeah, it was a running joke to say I looked like a pedo or child molestor. Because I had poor posture and was awkward and quiet. The last year of high school I spent sitting in a library in front of a computer by myself every day.

I began having bouts of depression. My panic attacks and dissociation got worse and eventually I was prescribed Zoloft. I managed to get on a couple of college courses, but they were a complete waste of time. I spent most days in the toilet with my head in my hands,

Now, I don't have panic attacks, but I do self harm. I have a lot of adrenaline from the job I work (kitchen) and usually end up really mad, and then mad that I am mad, and then get sad and cut myself. I stopped when my mum noticed, but I started again. I think about suicide a lot. I don't see it getting any better tbh.

1nffea3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicIllness/comments/1nffea3/im_tired_of_my_health_taking_everything_from_me/,I’m tired of my health taking everything from me (maybe a vent??) TW: slight talk of eating and scars,"

So I feel stupid for this but I don’t have anyone else to talk to about this and I really need to talk even if I feel like I’m kinda being dramatic for me. My health has taken everything from me. I’m pretty much house bound, I never have energy to be up more than 10 or so minutes at a time without it worsening my symptoms for days at a time. I’ve had to switch to online college and am only able to take a single course a semester (I feel like I’ll never finish my degree this way), I can’t go out and go shopping or anything without regretting it. I’m dealing with some aspect of my healthcare every minute of every day. I can’t go out and make friends because I don’t have the energy or even the means to. I’m a 22 year old woman and I can’t even drive. Hell, I’m literally unable to eat or drink anything. So I can’t even go like sit at a coffee shop or anything. I have many scars from everything and it normally doesn’t bother me. I’m really good at dealing with everything if I’m honest. I mean I have some days where I’m sad or something and I do have mental health issues but objectively I feel like I’m able to just keep rolling with the punches. But right now, I feel very hopeless and I’m just so sad and angry and tired. I’m mentally exhausted. I feel like I’ve lost everything, I know I haven’t, I mean I have an amazing family that I have to stay strong for. But I just want to be a normal 22 year old. I want to go out with friends, be able to walk the store without being bedridden for days afterwards, I want to be able to drive myself to the library, or not be hooked up to a medical device 24/7 that makes people stare or ask questions. I want to be able to be able to look at my body without being reminded every second of my bad health. I want to be able to go on a date. At this point I’ll settle for being able to drink a glass of water. These things normally don’t bother me and I’m used to it but right now I don’t want to be. I know I’m so lucky because I have access to life sustaining care that a lot of people don’t get. I’m able to be at home most of the time. I have reliable family. I know I’m lucky but when is it over? When has my health taken enough from me? I feel like I’ll never be able to have stable friendships, be completely independent, or even be functional. If one thing after another and I’m so angry, tired, isolated, in physical pain 24/7 and terrified it’s just going to keep getting worse. I don’t know how to deal with this rn. Im in therapy and I could talk to my family but I feel like they won’t get it and if I waver for one second around my main support system they will breakdown and get sad and hopeless and I can’t deal with that when I feel like this .

Chapter Five: Ember Quiet

PvZ Horror AU – CW: Mild Aftermath, Light Humor

The pounding outside grew frantic—wood splintering, claws scraping against metal.
Our Tall-nut barricade quivered under the weight of the horde.

“Time,” Dave croaked, voice dry as gravel.

I dropped to one knee and cracked open the last crate. Nestled in rich soil, two Cherry Bombs pulsed with a warm red glow, their stems twitching like excited fireworks waiting for a spark.

“Alright, cherries,” I said, brushing dirt from their smooth skins. “Let’s make it loud.”

The cherries bobbed and hummed—a sound like a tea kettle about to sing.
Dave squinted at them and muttered, “They look extra spicy tonight.”

I grinned. “Perfect.”

Outside, shadows clawed the factory walls. Coneheads scraped helmets along the siding like nails on a chalkboard. Imps clattered over broken glass, their tiny jaws snapping. A Buckethead’s steel drum screeched across the concrete as it rammed the door again and again.

The Cherry Bombs shivered, impatient.

“Three,” I whispered.
Dave joined in: “Two…”
The cherries chimed, perfectly on cue.

“One.”

I lobbed them through a jagged window.

The night erupted.
Twin blossoms of crimson light bloomed across the yard, shockwaves rippling the factory floor.
Flames rolled outward in a roaring circle. For an instant the fog itself ignited, turning the world into a fiery sunrise.

Every moan, every hiss, every clawing scratch cut off at once.

Silence.

Ash drifted past the window like black snow. A Conehead helmet spun across the ground, smoking.
The Tall-nut barricade stood blackened but solid.


---

The Long Exhale

I sagged against the wall, lungs burning.
Dave wheezed, then let out a crooked grin.
“Spicy,” he said.

“Extra crispy,” I replied.

We laughed—an odd, cracking sound in the stillness—until the last echo of fire faded into the night.


---

A Factory Becomes a Camp

Inside the factory, the emergency lights buzzed overhead, casting the machinery in sleepy red hues. The plants we’d saved rustled in their pots, trembling from the blast but alive.

Sunflowers tilted toward the faint glow, their faces soft with quiet radiance. A Peashooter yawned—actually yawned—snapping its pod shut with a squeaky pop.

“Good work, everyone,” I said, kneeling beside them.

The Sunflowers answered with a warm pulse of light that brushed against my skin like a hug.
The Snow Pea gave a frosty trill, little ice crystals drifting from its leaves.
The stoic Tall-nut rumbled low, a sound like distant thunder, then gave what could only be described as a slow nod.

Dave whistled. “They’re talkin’, huh?”

“Feels like it,” I said. “Not words—more like… feelings.”

The Tall-nut rumbled again, a clear yes in my mind.


---

Snack Time (Sort Of)

While Dave tended his bandaged arm, I rummaged through an old vending machine near the conveyor belts. The glass was cracked, but inside were bags of long-expired chips and a single dusty bottle of soda.

Dave grabbed the soda and squinted at the label. “Pre-zombie fizz. Vintage.”

“You really gonna drink that?”

He popped the cap with a grin. The hiss of carbonation startled a nearby Peashooter, which aimed reflexively until Dave raised a finger. “Peace, little buddy. Just a sip.”

He took one gulp and immediately winced. “Flat. Tastes like angry raisins.”

The Peashooter let out a squeaky laugh—no other word for it.


---

Quiet Conversations

We set up a rough camp between silent machines: crates for seats, a lantern propped on a busted conveyor belt. I counted our seed packets aloud—Peashooter, Snow Pea, Repeater, Jalapeño, Tall-nut—while the plants leaned closer, leaves rustling like curious ears.

“So,” Dave said, leaning back, “got a plan? Or are we just gonna start a salad bar?”

“First we rest,” I answered. “Then we figure out if this place has supplies. Maybe seed stock.”

A Sunflower brightened in approval. A Repeater bobbed its twin heads and fired a playful pea that pinged harmlessly off the Tall-nut’s shell.

The Tall-nut didn’t flinch—then very slowly pivoted until its blank face stared right back at the Repeater.
Even plants can glare.

Dave chuckled. “Tall-nut’s the strong, silent type. Respect.”


---

Night Thoughts

The factory settled into a steady rhythm: distant drips of condensation, the soft hum of emergency lights, the gentle breathing of living plants.

For the first time in days, I felt the tension in my shoulders fade. We were safe—for now.

I lay back against a crate, the Almanac resting on my chest. The blank Yeti page stayed stubbornly empty, but the plants’ soft rustling carried a wordless promise: Together.

Dave leaned against the Tall-nut like a pillow and muttered, half-asleep, “Tomorrow we find coffee. World’s still gotta have coffee.”

A Sunflower pulsed a warm glow over him like a night-light.

I smiled and let my eyes close.

Outside, the night held its breath.
Inside, we finally did the same.

Velvet Teddy - almost like a lighter shade of whirl, but pulls mauve. I like it, but on the fence. It looks like it has a white base, which makes it look a bit stark against my skin.

* The abstract form of the parry and i-frame style of combat is the rhythm game, which we see demonstrated in Sekiro: attacks are like a rhythm pattern you learn and respond to, with timing paramount. The logical conclusion of avoidance response combat, though, is the shmup, with spacing paramount. https://bsky.app/profile/fakekraid.bsky.social/post/3lykomol5722w

 * The way modern games design defensive mechanics is why there's been a huge pushback in circles against heavy I-frames/parrying cause they condition players to forget fundamentals older games taught the player. https://bsky.app/profile/appledees.bsky.social/post/3lylswzjtuk24
 * And also these fundamentals are not OLD GAME fundamentals, they are in ALL THESE GAMES. They are still implemented into designs. But yeah, the ""first order"" strategies of just ROLLIN' handles so much stuff, that stuff outside it is now seen as ""cheap and unfair"". https://bsky.app/profile/kayin.moe/post/3lylt37kpz22r

 * also notice that casual and even non-gamers are WAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYY more receptive to my game design ideas when I talk them out with them. Whereas enthusiast gamers will knee-jerk immediately. I think games culture actually cooks people's ability to think about these topics without getting defensive https://bsky.app/profile/julietstmoon.bsky.social/post/3lylvs5kplk2h
 * There's something I call the ""trough of familiarity"" when playtesting my game.

This is a follow-up to [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitingIceland/comments/1mzb38b/is_my_itinerary_ridiculous/) asking for itinerary feedback. I figured it might be helpful to share how things worked out and hopefully help others that are trying to plan their trip since you all helped me so much!

&nbsp;

Trip length was 7 days: Sept 3-10

&nbsp;

The linked itinerary was a great guideline for the trip and I feel like I was able to do most things I set out to do without feeling too rushed. An extra day would have been ideal but it was totally doable. Some things had to be cut or moved around due to weather but I feel like I mostly lucked out in that department. I'm a solo woman traveler and felt so safe the entire time.

&nbsp;

For anyone interested, [here is my one bag set up](https://www.reddit.com/r/HerOneBag/comments/1neimuf/iceland_september_packing_list/) for the trip.


&nbsp;


Alright, let's get into it.


&nbsp;


##My actual trip breakdown:

**Day 1: Arrive in Reykjavik**

- Landed at 2pm and picked up my rental car at Avis. Super easy and quick.

- Drove to Reykjavik guest house to drop my stuff off and walk around town.

- Stopped at a small cafe for dinner and went to bed early for the next day.

&nbsp;

**Day 2: Golden Circle**

- Got up early to hit Braud&Co for a cinnamon roll and croissant. Totally worth the hype. Also hit Reykjavik Roasters for a latte to go.

- Stopped at N1 Nesti for a road sandwich

- Drove out towards golden circle with a few small stops to admire the beauty. I was able to hit:

1. Thingvellir park

2. Bruarfoss

3. Strokkur geyser area. Hiked to the top of the trail which had a beautiful view. This also helped give more perspective to the height of the geyser!

4. Gullfoss. This waterfall was massive and very busy.

- Drove to Hella to sleep for the night

- Had fish and chips from a small food truck (Hekla Street Food). The couple running it were lovely.

&nbsp;

**Day 3: South coast to Vik**

- Drove to Seljalandsfoss and Gljúfrabúi. They are very close together. This area was crazy busy so I was in and out pretty quickly. The view of the cliff from a distance with multiple waterfalls coming out of it was incredible.

- Had planned to hike Skogafoss next but the weather was nasty so I pushed on towards Vik.

- Stopped at Dyrhólaey to see the lighthouse and coast views. Saw a whale here! 

- Drove to Reynisfjara. Super busy with tourists but definitely worth visiting. 

- Drove into Vik to check out the town. Went to Kronan grocery to get some snacks for dinner and for the long road trip to the lagoon the next day. 

- Drove back to Skogafoss as that is where my hotel was for the night. It was around 5:30 when I arrived and the weather was perfect. Decided to hike until it got dark. I was so thankful I did this. The most beautiful scenery I have seen. The golden hour light against the highlands, sheep grazing everywhere, the greenest moss and grass covering everything, and countless waterfalls. I didn't want to turn around and just kept pushing. Eventually I started to lose light and the rain came. 

- Stayed near Skogafoss that night 

&nbsp;

**Day 4: Vik to Jokulsarlon and back**

- Got up early and had breakfast at the hotel

- Drove straight to Mulagljufur Canyon. My plan was to hike first, hit Jökulsárlón, and then stop at the other spots on my way back to my hotel near Skogafoss. 

- The canyon hike took me about 90 minutes total. It was beautiful, however definitely not a secret spot lol. Never felt too crowded though. Look for crow berries to snack on! 

- Drove to Jokulsarlon. The icebergs were beautiful and so was the ocean. I think booking a zodiac tour this day would have made things way too tight. Maybe if I skipped the hike it would have been possible but I prioritized that instead.

- Drove back to hotel near Skogafoss. I was unfortunately running out of time so I had to skip any other south coast spots I had planned to stop at. I feel like an extra day down there would have been ideal since it's such a long drive. Glad I did it though.

- Grabbed a pizza in Vik and stopped at a viewpoint to eat it as the sun set.

- Stayed my second night at the hotel near Skogafoss.

&nbsp;

**Day 5: South coast to Borgarnes**

- Headed back west towards Snæfellsnes peninsula. My hotel for the night was in Borgarnes.

- Stopped at Keldur turf house/farm

- Stopped in Selfoss for a pylsa for lunch

- Drove towards Snorri's hot tub/Silver circle, but the wind and rain were so intense, I decided to go straight to Borgarnes.

- Went to the settlement museum which was a perfect stop during nasty weather. It was very charming and the audio tour was awesome. They also had a cute gift shop.

- Hit a kebab food truck for dinner

- Went to hotel for the night

&nbsp;

**Day 6: Borgarnes to Snæfellsnes peninsula**

- Left hotel and drove towards peninsula

- Drove to Ytri Tunga seal beach

- Drove to black church

- Drove to Arnarstapi and hiked to Hellnar and back along the coast.

- Stopped quickly at Londragar viewpoint 

- Stopped quickly to run up Saxhóll crater. This is a deceivingly quick stop. It took me about 2 minutes to run to the top.

- Drove to Svörtuloft Lighthouse. The road to get out to it is pretty gnarly and I would say you need a 4x4 or at least a high-clearance car to get to it.

- Drove to Kirkjufell mountain.

- Dinner in Grundarfjörður

- Hotel was just outside of town

&nbsp;

**Day 7: Snæfellsnes to Hvammsik and back to Reyjavik**

- Went back into Grundarfjörður to stop at Valeria coffee roasters. Amazing coffee and unique gift shop.

- Headed towards Hvammsik hot springs for my 12:30 apt

- Hvammsik was perfect. Not too crowded and was right next to the bay so you could take a dip in the sea. I stayed here for about 2 hours.

- Drove back to Reykjavik

- Checked in to my last hotel and grabbed dinner.



&nbsp;

**Day 8: Travel day**
- Got to the airport around 7:45am for my 10:40 flight. Returned my car and grabbed breakfast and coffee in the airport.


&nbsp;


**Highlights**

- The hike behind Skogafoss in the evening was something I will never forget. I showed up around 5:30pm when the crowds thinned out and kept hiking until I lost sunlight/the rain got too heavy and my phone died from taking so many photos. It was awesome.

- Mulagljufur Canyon hike was great as well. Big payoff for not a whole lot of work.

- The sheep everywhere! They are so dang cute. Also please watch out for them and don't get too close. They are someone else's livestock so be respectful.

&nbsp;

**Just a few small tips**

- Buy or bring a water bottle and fill that baby up anytime you have access to tap water. Do not buy bottled water. The tap water is delicious! I just bought a large Smartwater at the airport and kept that bottle for my entire trip.

- If you are looking to save some money on food, go to any N1 Nesti/gas station or Kronan grocery and get yourself a sandwich or wrap and some snacks for the day. I saved a a lot by not dining out much. It's also fun to try all of the different snacks that you can't get at home (shout out SMASH).

- Hot dogs/the legendary pylsa: I tried 3 different spots because I had to know which ones were best lol. I hit the N1 gas station, Pylsuvagninn in Selfoss, and Bæjarins Beztu in Reykjavik. My number one was Pylsuvagninn. Bæjarins ranked second and N1 was pretty meh honestly. I invite you to take your own pylsa tour because they're everywhere and cheap.


&nbsp;


**How much I drove**

1,579km or 981 miles

&nbsp;

**What I spent**

Total: $2,524 (+ credit card points)

Total w/out points: $3,400


I booked this trip about 2 weeks before I was going to leave. I may have saved some money by booking earlier.

&nbsp;

**Flight: $0**

I used credit card points so I spent $0. Would have been around $500 round trip if I had paid cash. I spent about 45,000 chase points instead.

&nbsp;

**Car rental: $211**

I used points for this as well so only had to pay for insurance which was $211 for the week. The total without points would have been around $600. I rented a small 4x4 from Avis at Keflavik airport (Suzuki Jimny).

&nbsp;

**Hotels: $1,500**

I kept my hotel budget at or around $200 per night.

&nbsp;

**Fuel: $328**

I paid roughly around 280isk per liter. I used Orkan stations almost exclusively because they didn't require a CC pin number and my car rental keys had a discount/loyalty fob I could scan at these stations.

&nbsp;

**Food & groceries: $360**

I bought my lunches at N1 stations or Kronan grocery stores. I also kept a bag of snacks in the car (grapes, nuts, chips, etc.) for the road when I got hungry. I saved a lot here by doing this. Eating at restaurants is easily $30-$50 per person for a modest meal. Some of my hotels had breakfast included. I only ate out three times during the week.

&nbsp;

**Parking: $80**

Most major stops will require a parking fee which they monitor closely. The fees were around $8-$10 per stop and usually payable through the Parka app.

&nbsp;

**Misc: $45**

Settlement museum and a magnet to take home

1nfesqk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fjallraven/comments/1nfesqk/preloved_misrepresentation_the_fjallraven/,PreLoved Misrepresentation: The Fjallraven Nightmare,"Hello,

I am curious how many of you have achieved satisfactory resolution to the issue of buying something on Fjallraven's PreLoved website, only to receive a product that has been misrepresented?  Unfortunately, I feel victim to this yet again today, and it's not sitting well with me.

We have had this discussion: [""Disappointing Experience with Fjällräven Pre-Loved Gear Return Policy""](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fjallraven/comments/1j3dtik/disappointing_experience_with_fj%C3%A4llr%C3%A4ven_preloved/) where the OP and others in the thread describe the problem:  An item is listed on PreLoved, is misrepresented, and then PreLoved Customer Service leaves you in the dark when you alert them to the problem.  No returns are accepted at PreLoved, except in cases of misrepresentation... but apparently customers have had a hard time getting refunds and returns when this problem actually happens.

I have had this problem a few times on the PreLoved site, and perhaps coincidentally the only account that has given me any problems with misrepresentation is the [PreLoved account itself](https://preloved.fjallraven.com/vendor/fjllrvenp-1sqlq).  All items bought from individuals have been accurate and also contained the fun little note they suggest including in your shipment. PreLoved employees have no time for a fun little note either. At present that account has 655 items listed, and the veracity of the information is dubious at best. 

That PreLoved account possibly appears to be a general account perhaps used by every Fjallraven store to list items they want to clear out. Multiple store employees sharing this account might explain how some listings are accurate and are done with care, and other are slapdash and are clearly done without attention to detail or following any kind of best practice.

An Example:

Items are listed generally, then clicked on where you are shown the different available sizes and colors.  I have run into (and purchased) and item where ""a size"" was listed in the title ""Expedition Padded Cap L/XL"", and then the listing is for a size S/M.  Whomever made that listing didn't understand the listing conventions, or hadn't had their coffee, or didn't care.  At the time I asked PreLoved customer service via email which size it actually was.  They got back to me that indeed the cap was S/M, [but they never bothered to change the listing](https://i.imgur.com/ko3TQfD.png).  So that incorrect, convention-breaking listing is still there just waiting to cause another problem.  No one took initiative to clean up the listing or remove it.

Another issue is that when selling on PreLoved you're supposed to include several pictures of the actual physical item. I always include shots of the tags so there is no confusion.  PreLoved themselves tend to use only the default Fjallraven website photo for an item, and never ever take actual photos of the actual item being sold. If they bothered to follow their own suggested best practices, problems would be avoided.  Obviously that takes time and effort, and I'm sure the idea at corporate was just to magically turn old stock sitting around into sales, and no one realiz the individual effort employees would have to make to ensure things are listed accurately and thoroughly.


Today I received a Bergtagen Lite Insulation Jacket that was listed as a Men's M. It only had one picture, and that was the default Fjallraven website image for the men's version.  It arrived. It's a Woman's M. It is twenty three sizes too small and I have zero use for it.  Sure, I can waste my time and energy reselling it on PreLoved, but I should be allowed to return this. Seeing so many people run into the same issue and not seeing one report satisfaction has got me a little worried.  I await a customer service response, but I do not have confidence.

I would suggest Fjallraven have a look at how Patagonia is doing used clothes, and you'll find a much smoother experience.  I don't think they're using **Archive Resale Inc.** to handle their used stuff like Fjallraven does.  Maybe they're providing a lousy platform?  Patagonia even has links to a used version of an item on their main website.  When you look at a pair of pants, if there is used available, the link to it is right there.  Seamless, no errant listings.  Professional.

Have you had a similar experience and what was the outcome for you?  I would also like to invite u/FjallravenOfficial to the discussion in hopes of making the experience better for everyone involved.",4,1757710979.0,Fjallraven,0,1.0,False

1nfesfa,https://i.redd.it/fmrjdry3tsof1.jpeg,💊 Switched from Expensive Pre-Workouts to Just Caffeine + Citrulline Malate – Did I Make the Right Choice?,"When I used to take pre-workouts (the ones I circled in red in the picture), people didn’t really have a problem with it. After all, they are popular and well-known brands that many lifters have already used.

But here’s the thing—most of these pre-workouts contain 200 mg caffeine along with 3–4 other ingredients (like beta-alanine, creatine, etc.). Some days, I just want the pump effect, but I end up consuming caffeine anyway. Other days, maybe I only want caffeine for focus and endurance, but I’m still forced to take all the extra ingredients I don’t even need.

Also, pre-workouts are expensive. For example, one of them costs me about ₹700 for just 15 servings (that’s only half a month). After that, I have no clue what to do—keep buying again and again? Not really sustainable.

So I thought about what I actually need. I realized for me it’s just:

Caffeine → for energy, endurance, and focus

Citrulline Malate → for the pump


That’s it. Nothing else.

So, I switched to what you see in the blue circle:

200 mg caffeine tablets (60 capsules, cost me about ₹200)

Citrulline Malate (about ₹250)


This combo will easily last me almost 2 months, since I don’t even need a pump every day (only on chest/back days, not legs, etc.). Much more budget-friendly than branded pre-workouts.

But yesterday I asked Reddit if caffeine tablets are fine, and I got mixed responses:

Some people said: “No bro, don’t take caffeine tablets.”

Others said: “Just buy a cheap pre-workout, it’s better.”

Some said: “Just drink coffee.”


Now here’s my issue: I don’t like coffee at all—the taste feels bitter and weird to me. People say mix honey, but do you realize I’d need like 5 packets of instant coffee (since each ₹1 Nestlé packet only has ~40 mg caffeine) just to get ~200 mg caffeine? I can’t even handle 1 packet’s taste, let alone 5.

So I genuinely want to ask—did I do the right thing by choosing just caffeine tablets + citrulline malate? Or am I missing something important?",1,1757710960.0,Fitness_India,2,1.0,False

I recently bought a small moka pot (3/4 cup of water to fill just under the valve) from a local thrift store, and every time I try to make some coffee, it tastes awful. I use only dark roasted beans (the only roast I like) and maybe that's causing some issues?? I come from using drip brewers which really do everything for you, but I do buy beans and grind them myself. 

I use a Kingrinder P1 and I have tried 100, 120, and 150 clicks, and everything is still bad. 

I have tried 110, 130, and 150 grams of pre-boiled AND room temp water, and it still doesn't taste good. 

I have set my stove to low-low, low-medium and medium heat, and the flow is nice and even, but it just doesn't taste good.

Is my palatte just not refined enough for such an exquisite brewing method??? Every cup tastes burnt and like ash. I clean the pot out every time I use it too. Thanks for any help. Please. I need it.",3,1757710806.0,mokapot,8,1.0,False

1nfeox0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nfeox0/the_factory/,The Factory,"We called it The Factory because no one could remember what it used to be. Grain, people said. Feed. Maybe soy. It sat alone at the end of a road that turned from asphalt to gravel to dirt, like the town itself had run out of nerve halfway there. Four stories of brick the color of old blood, with black eyeholes where glass had been. A metal fire stair zigzagged up the side, clinging there like a spiderweb, and every wind made the treads shiver and sing.

It was about a mile beyond the last ranch house and two beyond the Dairy Queen. The fields around it weren’t corn, not that year; shoulder-high weeds and foxtails, Queen Anne’s lace, milkweed pods split open to fur. The only other building nearby was a low concrete block that used to be an office and now had a roof like a curled lip. A chain-link fence enclosed the lot, but it crouched in the grass and buckled in places where people had crawled under. Somebody had hung NO TRESPASSING signs on it. Somebody else had shot holes in the signs.

We were twelve and thirteen, and the town was a circle of nothing to do. There were five of us most days: me, Jamie, Tyler, Cody, and Hannah. We had bikes and a deck of cards with three queens missing and an old soccer ball that veered left and a set of walkie-talkies that only sometimes worked between the cul-de-sac and the creek. We had empty afternoons two inches deep with heat. We had the factory.

Jamie had the ideas. He didn’t look like a leader in movies. He didn’t have broad shoulders or jawline you could strike a match on. He was wiry and light on his feet and he talked with his hands. He had a grin that made you forget you’d sworn not to do whatever he was suggesting. Tyler followed him everywhere, taller by a head, the kind of kid who did dumb things out of loyalty and then apologized to teachers with his whole face. Hannah was sharp like a new blade; she did things because people told her not to and laughed while she did. Cody was the youngest, soft-cheeked and fast to pretend he wasn’t scared. He chewed his hoodie strings until they were hard little ropes. Me? I wasn’t brave or funny or mean. I don’t really remember how I became friends with the others. Just that one day I woke up and couldn’t remember life before knowing them.

The summer I’m talking about was dry. Dust made a skin on everything. The weeds at the edge of the lot whispered when you walked past, and grasshoppers snapped out of the way in arcs like thrown pebbles. The only shade was the building’s own shadow, cool and thin and not much use unless you moved with it. We liked to go at the end of the day, when the heat was thinking about giving up.

The first time we played manhunt there, we did it because Jamie said the words in the tone that made things inevitable: “You’re all too chicken to play for real.”

“Define ‘for real,’” Hannah said, rolling her eyes.

“Inside,” he said. “Whole place. One person counts, everyone else hides. No roofs. No silos.”

“We’re not going in the silos,” Tyler said, horrified at a danger none of us had actually suggested.

“Obviously,” Jamie said. “First one caught counts next. No crying. No ‘I heard something, you guys.’ You hear pigeons. Or rats. It’s a building.”

He cut the fence where it sagged and we bellied under, one by one, the metal taste of rust in our mouths. The factory door had been welded shut long ago, but other doors had not. The low office had a kicked-out panel on the back. We went in that way, under dangling wires and a strand of yellow tape that had lost its warning words. It smelled like mildew and old work: cardboard, spilled oil, mouse shit. Someone had spray-painted a cartoon dick on the back wall at kid height. Someone else had spray-painted “SAM + CHELLE 1997” in careful bubble letters under a dusty calendar from 1994.

Past the office, a hallway opened onto the main floor and the smell changed. The air had a mineral sting. Dust motes drifted like snow in our flashlight beams; the shafts of light from the broken windows turned them into glitter. The room was an open field of concrete with metal skeletons rising at irregular intervals: frames of machines, hoppers like giant funnels, chutes that angled down into the floor and vanished. A catwalk crisscrossed the higher half of the room, rust drops darkening the floor underneath where it bled. Somewhere a pipe dripped into a metal bucket: ping… ping… ping. Pigeons made cooing sounds that weren’t sweet at all in that empty space.

“Smells like the inside of a penny,” Hannah said.

“It’s sick,” Tyler said, and I couldn’t tell if he meant cool or gross.

We scattered because that’s what you do when a place is too big and you’re trying to act unafraid: you move, make noise, pretend the fear is behind you. Jamie put his hand on the brick beside the door and said, “Sixty. Loud. Ready? One, two, three…” His counting rolled and bounced, filled the place, made it seem both more and less empty.

I grabbed Cody’s sleeve. “This way.”

“Where?” He was trying to make his voice tough. It came out breathy.

“Office upstairs,” I said, though I didn’t actually know if there was one. It seemed like the kind of factory that would have an office upstairs, a little fishbowl to look down at people working. We edged along the wall and ducked into a tangle of old machinery, ducked again under a belly of rusted panels, and found a staircase that took us up through the smell of pigeon shit and sun-warmed metal to a small room with windows that were grease-gray with age.

There was a desk in there, tipped sideways. A rolling chair on its back. A mug cemented to the floor with what had once been coffee, glued there with dust. A calendar curling up at the corners. A jacket on a peg, frozen in a hunch. The windows looked down over the main floor like a control booth in a bad movie.

“Perfect,” I said. We slid behind the desk. Cody breathed like he’d run a mile.

A clatter of feet on metal made us flinch. Tyler on the catwalk, moving too fast. A pigeon shot across our window, close enough that I saw the gleam of its eye.

“Twenty-seven… twenty-eight…” Jamie’s voice floated up. It made my skin run cold even though his tone was bored. The bored tone is how you know boys are going to do something stupid. They have to act like nothing could possibly happen.

Cody grinned at me, a quick flash of teeth. The grin said all the things this game was supposed to say: I am not scared. I am with my friends. This is ours.

Footsteps sounded in the hallway outside our little office, slow and soft. They weren’t on the catwalk, and they weren’t running. They had a weight to them that made me imagine boots. They stopped just past the doorway. I held my breath. Cody held his. I could hear something else: a breath, faint and steady, not mine.

I leaned to the crack at the desk’s edge, just an inch, enough to see a sliver of the doorframe and the rectangle of the hall beyond. There was nothing there. Empty concrete. A peeled stripe of paint.

The breath didn’t go with the empty hall. It was close and not close. Cody’s eyes asked, Do you hear that? Mine said, Don’t move.

“Ready or not,” Jamie yelled, “here I come!”

The slow breath paused. The footsteps moved away, unhurried, and vanished into the general noise of a building settling into itself.

“Probably Hannah,” Cody mouthed.

“Probably,” I mouthed back, even though Hannah didn’t walk like that. She had a hop to her and an impatience that telegraphed itself in little toe-taps. These steps felt like someone who didn’t have to hurry anywhere.

Jamie took too long to find us because he found Tyler first. Tyler is too tall to hide and too honorable to cheat. After a while a hand grabbed the back of my shirt and yanked and I yelped and it was Hannah, grinning, triumphant. “Get your asses up, you turtles,” she whispered. “You coming?”

“We heard someone,” Cody blurted.

“You heard me,” she said, and rolled her eyes in a way that made the whole idea of the breath feel like something embarrassing I’d invented to be interesting. We let her pull us out into the hallway, and the echo of our sneakers overran the echo of anything else.

We played two more rounds that evening. I got found fast because I’m not good at standing still. The pigeons went off every time anyone moved too fast. The light slanted and turned the dust gold, then copper, then the kind of brown you get on the bottoms of your feet when you play outside all day. Cody hid behind a stack of wooden pallets that looked like teeth, then in a half-open chute that I made him get out of because “you’ll get stuck and we’ll all have to explain it to someone with a clipboard”.

We left at sunset, drunk on dust and triumph. There was a smear of rust on Cody’s cheek like war paint. Hannah had pigeon crap on her sleeve and didn’t know it. Jamie hopped the fence with a cocky little pike-kick. Tyler went over awkwardly and then reached back to pull me through because I got my shirt snagged on a curl of wire.

“Again tomorrow,” Jamie said, because he didn’t know how not to push a thing until it gave way.

“Again tomorrow,” we said.

I remember that ride home in the blue hour like a photograph someone left in the sun: us arrowing down the road in a ragged line, the factory falling behind us and coming along anyway in the ringing in my ears, the feeling that everything we’d done had woken something up that had been sleeping.

The second day we brought better flashlights, a disposable camera, and snacks. The camera was a green Kodak with a lever you had to grind your thumb against to move the film. I’d bought it at the gas station with money from mowing Mrs. Rennie’s lawn, planning to use it on the last day of summer before school, photograph the creek and our bikes and our faces making faces. I took a picture of us at the fence, Jamie doing the same kick, Hannah flipping the bird, Tyler looking annoyingly like a yearbook photo even when he was making fun, Cody trying to look tough and failing. That picture still exists. It’s in a shoebox somewhere up high on a closet shelf where I can’t see it by accident.

“Rules,” Jamie said at the office door, suddenly serious. “No roofs. No silos. No going past the orange line.”

“What orange line?” Tyler asked.

Jamie took us inside to the main floor and pointed at a rectangle someone had painted on the concrete around a big metal cabinet and a cluster of tanks. The paint had faded to the color of cheddar cheese past its date. The line had words by each corner: DANGER / DO NOT ENTER / LOCKOUT / and a fourth line that pigeons had decorated beyond reading.

“You don’t cross the line,” Jamie said. “You can hide behind stuff near it, but you don’t go in there, and you don’t go down the hatch if it’s open.”

“How do you know there’s a hatch?” Hannah said, hair in her eyes, tone full of dare.

“Because my cousin worked here before it closed,” he said. “He said they dropped things into pits and ground them up. Like,” he made his hand into a blender. “You fall into a hopper, no one hears you except the guy who has to fill out the safety form.”

“Gross,” Cody said, half-admiring.

We played. We were louder than we meant to be and quieter than we thought we were, the way kids are. The building made everything both. Our voices warped around corners. Our footsteps split and rejoined. The wind outside made the stair squeal and the squeal came from everywhere. We scattered and found each other again in pockets of shadow, grinning. 

The first round, Hannah counted loudly while chewing gum, and I thought: her gum doesn’t pop like that. The sound was off somehow, sticky where hers is crisp. But I didn’t see anyone else chewing when I peeked. Second round, Tyler counted, and while he was at “twenty-nine… thirty…” a door down the far hall swung shut with a soft kiss even though no one was in that direction.

Third round, it was my turn to count, and when I got to fifty everyone was gone and my voice sounded small. That’s when I noticed the chalk marks.

They were low on the wall near the baseboard in the hall by the old offices, near where the light from a window made a pale rectangle. Five sets of hash marks clustered together, each with a name scratched in kid handwriting between: J /T / S/ H/ C. The sixth said E. 

Five of us and E. 

“Guys?” I called, too loud. It came out like a question. “Jamie?”

The stair on the far side clanked with someone’s foot where it shouldn’t have. Cody skittered by at the end of the hall, saw me looking, made a face like I was already caught. Somewhere higher up, a pigeon batted itself into a window again and again with a stupid thump. The chalk marks waited. I touched them, and chalk came off on my finger that felt new, not decayed and powdery. We hadn’t made them. Someone else had, recently.

“Ready or not,” I said, and took my own advice.

I found Tyler behind an overturned conveyor belt. I found Hannah sitting cross-legged behind an array of pipes, chewing gum that clicked sharp on the roof of her mouth. I found Jamie by the loading dock, tucked between the buckled rubber bumper and the cinderblock like a cat. We counted again, swapped roles, fanned out, came back. The afternoon thickened and the light came in sideways and at a certain point Cody didn’t answer when we called his name to give up.

“Hiding too good,” Jamie said, trying to be impressed.

“Cheating,” Hannah said, trying to be annoyed.

“Cody!” Tyler bellowed. It turned into three syllables, more a sound than a word.

No answer. Not a giggle. Not the scuff of shoes. Not a pigeon thump. The building leaned in like it was holding its breath with us.

We spread wider. We checked stupid places: inside the old metal cabinets full of nothing, behind the tipped desk upstairs where I’d thought we were clever, inside the little bathroom whose stall doors had been kicked off but still felt private, like you should knock. I felt the kind of trembling I associate now with low blood sugar and then thought was fear or excitement. We yelled and the yelling made a shape that seemed impossible not to be heard.

We found his backpack sitting open behind a stack of pallets near the orange line. Inside: a warm Capri Sun, his inhaler, a handful of Skittles melted into a smear, a pen he’d chewed to death, the other end of his hoodie string that wasn’t yet a rope. That’s when the fear stood up and took its coat off.

“He wouldn’t leave his bag,” Tyler said. He sounded like he was practicing talking to an adult later.

“Cody!” Jamie’s voice cracked on the second syllable. He didn’t look at any of us while it did.

“Maybe he went outside to pee,” Hannah said, but it didn’t sound like she believed it and it didn’t sound like a joke, either.

We did the thing you do when you’re kids and you’ve made a mistake big enough to see: we panicked badly and then tried to be sensible. We agreed to meet back at the office door in five minutes. We each took a floor, moving too fast, catching ourselves, moving too slow. I went down, to the lowest level, to the place where the concrete sweated and the standing water in the middle of the floor had a skin on it. The pipes down there had insulation that hung off like rotten fur. There was more graffiti down there that wasn’t dicks or initials. Letters in a different hand: little neat block capitals that said QUIET HOURS and CLEAN MONDAY and names and times that read like a work schedule and a map to a life I didn’t want to picture. Above a rusted sink someone had written, in that neat hand, NO ODORS. Underlined. Three times.

There was a bedroll by the far wall. A real one. Zippered black nylon, laid on top of cardboard, with a folded blanket and a hat sitting on the blanket like a person had put it there with care. Next to it: a grocery bag I recognized from the cheap store in town, with the corner of a loaf of bread peeking out. A plastic laundry line stretched between two pipes with a shirt draped over it to dry. The shirt had missing buttons but had been washed and rung out and hung with equal pieces on each side like someone for whom symmetry was a kind of dignity.

Next to the bedroll, in a neat line: five cigarette butts lined parallel to the wall. Not thrown, not crushed. Arranged.

I went stiff, like my bones had opinions. I felt seen from the back. I wanted to turn around and look behind me and at the same time not turn around because if I didn’t see it then it wasn’t there. The air down there was colder than it should have been in a summer afternoon. Not cold like air conditioning but cold like air that had spent a long time pressed against stone.

“Guys,” I said to the room, and I meant our faces and I meant the ones we hadn’t met. “Guys.”

When I moved, something moved with me. A shadow invented by before and after, my own shoulder catching my own light. I walked backwards to the stairs, then ran up them, then forced myself to stop and walk so I could breathe. At the main floor, I ran.

Jamie was already at the office door, white where he wasn’t sunburned. Hannah came up with her mouth set tight, hands dirty. Tyler didn’t come at all; we had to go find him, and he was in the hall by the chalk marks, rubbing them with his thumb hard enough to grind dust into his skin like he was trying to erase. “Those weren’t here yesterday,” he said like a prayer. “Those weren’t here.”

We went outside. I know that sounds like giving up. It wasn’t. It was a need as physical as thirst. The light stabbed our eyes and made the world look too bright, too flat, like we’d come in from underwater. 

Jamie held onto the fence post and put his head down. 

Hannah said, “If he’s hiding as a joke I’m going to kill him.” 

Tyler counted us under his breath: one, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. His mouth shaped the numbers like they were a spell.

We yelled Cody’s name in the weeds and it wavered in the heat. We called into the office. We called at the loading dock. We called at the door to the stairwell that goes to the roof even though the rule was no roofs. The building hummed like it did not care about rules or names.

When we went back in, the orange line was different. It had been broken near one corner, a chip out of the paint you wouldn’t have noticed unless you were looking for how the world changes when you’re not in it. The metal cabinet within the line had a lock on it with the loop pried open. I could see the silver brackets bent slightly. There were scuffs on the concrete from something being dragged. Next to those scuffs: a smear of dirty water from a wet shoe.

My foot lined up next to it. Mine small in my head, Cody smaller in my head - this other shoe print wrong. The tread had a boxy shape, a little square in the heel like a stamp. None of us had soles like that.

“Okay,” Jamie said. “Okay. Okay.” He was saying it the way people say I’m fine when they’re bleeding. “We go get help. We go now.”

He ran. We followed. We left Cody’s backpack because we had this stupid idea about leaving a place the way you found it so you didn’t get in worse trouble than you were already in; that’s the kind of thinking that tells you how old we were. We ran for the road, for the bitey gravel and then the softer shoulder and then the hot asphalt that radiated through our soles. Jamie biked so fast he almost ate it twice. Hannah sprinted and then got a stitch and bent double and swore at herself and ran anyway. Tyler trotted like a good machine. I kept trying to go faster and my legs kept reminding me I had no more go faster in me.

By the time we got to the first house on the edge of town, a ranch with a kid’s plastic mower in the yard and a faded flag, my throat tasted like pennies and bile. A woman with sun-weathered arms opened the door and frowned at us like we were a raccoon she hadn’t decided whether to feed or chase.

“There’s-” Jamie said, and then had to stop and bend and put his hands on his knees not to puke. It didn’t work.

“Inside,” she said, instantly changing shape. “Inside now.”

Police came. Parents came. The factory that afternoon was a done-up version of itself: grown-ups in vests, a van with its hazards blinking, the sound of radios making everything more real and less immediate at once. I stood under a tree at the edge of the lot and watched strangers walk through the holes in the building I already knew and wished I didn’t. 

An officer named R. Spencer, according to her name tag, crouched to look me in the face and asked me to say everything from the beginning. I told her about the chalk marks and the bedroll and the cigarettes lined up and the orange line and the shoe tread and the breath outside the office the day before. 

They looked. They yelled his name the way we had, like names are nets you can throw over a person and bring them back. They shook their heads at things only grown-ups shake their heads at. Codes, liability, the right papers to force locks. They did force the bent lock, eventually. The metal cabinet had electrical switches inside, long handles with tags that said things like FEED AUGER 3 and EMERGENCY STOP. I saw a man touch one with his pen and then record something in a book on a little shelf. I saw another man take a camera out and photograph a smear that the rest of us had not seen yet: a faint brown line on concrete, dragged and then broken, then dragged and then stopped. The pigeons went wild when the flash went off.

They took us home when the light started to go, because you have to take kids home. Cody’s mother stood in her yard in a T-shirt and pajama pants and cried loud, the kind of loud that makes neighbors look away and then look back because that sound is a public event. Nobody told her to stop. Cody’s father was a block of a man with a flattened voice who kept saying, “He’ll be in the creek. He’ll have gone to the creek,” like he was going to will the boy into a normal kind of mistake. He had a beer can in his hand that he squeezed without drinking.

We all lied in our own ways about where we’d been. Nobody wanted the other part of the trouble, the trespassing kind. It didn’t hold. In small towns, nothing does. By morning, everyone knew where we had been. By afternoon, the factory had more signs, fresh and bright, plastic and red, barking orders at kids who already knew how to slip under the fence.

There were searches. There were men with sticks poking through the ditches along the road. There were volunteers in neon vests doing a line across the fields like a slowed-down parade. There was a helicopter that hovered for one hour and then left. The sheriff stood on the hood of a truck and spoke through a megaphone and the words “no evidence of foul play” floated over the heads of the adults. Someone put Cody’s school picture on a poster and then a bigger poster and then a whole wall in the gas station. There was a reward. 

If you’re waiting for me to say we found his shoe or his hat or a lamp of bone, I won’t. That’s not the story I have. I have the story where a kid goes in and does not come out, and for the rest of your life your body will look for him every time you see a boy in a hoodie with the strings chewed hard. I have the story where you watch adults take a building seriously for a week and then less seriously and then not at all. The story where the sheriff says into a reporter’s microphone, “we are investigating all possibilities, including that the boy may have run away,” and you feel something rot slowly inside you at the way the word *including* can hold a lie.

After five weeks, the posters got wet around the corners in the night and curled and had to be replaced, and they weren’t. After a year, the factory wore a new padlock like a brooch and half the windows were boarded and someone had painted over the graffiti with square gray patches that made the whole building look like a broken crossword.

We were all changed and not changed. Jamie got meaner and then quiet. Tyler learned how to take tests without thinking about anything else and left for college two years ahead of me. Hannah got a girlfriend, then another, then a boyfriend, and then left for a city and never came back for more than a weekend. I froze whenever I smelled wet cardboard. 

There were things I didn’t say then that I can say now. Two weeks after Cody disappeared, I went back by myself. This is where you shake your head and say, you idiot. I know. I went on a weekday when my mother thought I was at the library and my father was on a long-haul and the heat had broken into a September that felt like a long breath out. The fence had a new repair that sagged differently. I went through it. I went around to the low office and ducked in past the dead strip of sun. I carried the disposable camera in my back pocket because my stupid brain had decided evidence had something to do with light.

It was quieter without the others. The pigeons cooed and shat and cooed some more but they didn’t spook as easily with one set of feet. My own footsteps felt rude. The main floor had the square gray paint. The orange line looked freshly bright again because the sheriff’s department had dusted it for prints and rubbed it dull and someone had come later and decided the thing to do was paint the danger sharper. The neat chalk marks in the hallway were gone. The wall was a chalky smear like a chalkboard badly erased. Over it, someone had spray-painted a bubble tag with a date and a handle I didn’t recognize.

I went down to the low level, because that was what I had not been able to stop thinking about. The air had that stone-cold again. The bedroll was gone. The cardboard had been collected and baled by someone who thought about hazards. The laundry line had a new string, bright nylon with no shirt. The wall over the sink still said NO ODORS, twice, once in the careful hand and once in bigger letters that rounded like a child’s and underlined hard enough to scratch plaster. There were more cigarette butts, but they weren’t in a line anymore. Just a pile.

I took pictures without looking through the viewfinder properly: the sink, the corner where the bed had been, the floor where the bed wasn’t, the pipe. The flash made the whole place strobe and in that instant I saw how the puddle in the center mirrored the ceiling, and how the ceiling had a stain that looked like a hand that looked like water that looked like nothing. The disposable camera whined. I wound it with my thumb until the little red dot in the viewfinder went solid again.

That’s when I heard the voice. Not words but a cough. The wet little cough of someone who doesn’t quite clear their throat because there’s no one to hear if they do. It came from above, from the stair, from the place where the shadow pooled at the angle where the wall met the underside of the steps. Not a footfall. Not a pipe. A sound made by tissue, by meat.

“Hello,” I said into it, because I didn’t know what else to say and I had the sense, like a deer has, that running would be the wrong thing even though walking wasn’t right. “Hello?”

Nothing. Then, not in answer: a soft scrape. The sound of a shoelace being pulled tight against an eyelet.

I stayed where I was and put the camera at my chest and pressed the button. The flash slashed the dark and made the angle under the stair into a picture, and in that picture was a pale coin of a face that might have been only a smudge on the concrete, a shoulder that might have been a beam, and an eye. I know how that sounds. Plenty of people have told me plenty of times that I saw what I came to see. That it was pareidolia, a word with enough syllables to make people feel safe. I took three steps back, then turned, then walked as fast as walking lets you, then ran when I hit the hallway. The building let me go like it hadn’t known I was there in the first place.

Two days later I took the camera to be developed. The clerk gave me a claim ticket and laughed at the outdatedness of it and told me they still did a few rolls a week for weddings and old men who never learned. I came back a week after that when the prints were delayed because the machine had eaten someone else’s negative. When the envelope was finally in my hands I stood outside in the heat and flipped through the pictures and felt stupid and scared in equal measures and then I felt heat rise up my neck under my hair and into my face. Photo one: us at the fence, stupid and easy. Two: Hannah’s gum bubble mid-pop, the gum a weird gray in film. Three: light sliced into the main room, dust like galaxy. Four: a blur from moving too fast on the stair. Five: the hallway with no chalk marks yet, just a smear. Six: the sink with NO ODORS. Seven: the corner where the bed had been. Eight: the angle under the stair.

If I show it to you, you’ll see whatever you come ready to see. Maybe you’ll see a stain on concrete. Maybe you’ll see a dark smudge where the shadow is heavier. Maybe you’ll see the edge where something that has been there a long time meets the place where it hasn’t. If you’re me, you’ll see an eye looking directly at the flash in that stuttering instant, and you’ll imagine the way the dark blooms back in after the flash and how someone standing too close would stay still so as not to scrape their shoelace again.

I told no one. Not because I wanted to keep it. Because I already knew what adults would say, and because the photo doesn’t prove anything except that the building has corners. I put the envelope in the shoebox. I told myself the person who slept there was someone who had been careful to have dignity: clean Monday, no odors, neat cigarettes, a softened bread loaf, a hat. I told myself the running was rude. I told myself all the stories I needed to be the kind of person who could finish high school and turn eighteen and move away.

Years have gone by like they do, in a way where you don’t notice until you do. Cody’s mother moved. His father didn’t. Once, when I was visiting home because a friend’s mother died and you go, whether or not you want to, I saw him at the gas station buying cigarettes and windshield wiper fluid, and he said my name and then stopped like the hand he’d put out was about to touch a stove. “You were there,” he said.

“Yes,” I said. There wasn’t a way to say “I’m sorry” that didn’t sound like “I feel bad,” which wasn’t the point.

He nodded. He paid. He left. The door chimed and chimed and then the station was quiet except for the cooler’s hum.

The factory came down the year after that. Not all at once, the way buildings fall in movies. In pieces, in a long insult. They took the stair first, and the sound of it coming down woke me in my new apartment three miles away even though there was no way the noise could carry. They combed the footprint like a cat burying a thing. They poured a slab. They put up a fence and a sign that said COMING SOON: SELF STORAGE.

I went one last time before it was all gone, because I wanted to see if anything was there that would make any adult say anything new. The fence had a real lock, not the kind you snip with the cheap tool set in a boy’s garage. I walked the perimeter in the evening and watched swifts stitch the sky and listened to insects vibrate their bodies into noise and when I got to the place where the office had been I stopped. There was a square of nothing. Gravel had been raked into new order. And there, half-buried at the edge where the machines had not yet done their work, was a coin.

No, not a coin. A circle from the neck of a plastic bottle. That ring that pops off when you unscrew the cap the first time. It was orange. It made a perfect loop in the dust. Someone had threaded a shoelace through it, the way kids do when they are bored and make talismans. The lace had knots in a pattern I recognized in the stupid way your body recognizes a step pattern at the top of stairs in a dark house. The knots were spaced close together on one side and far on the other. That was the way Cody did them: three, then a thumb’s width, then two, then a thumb’s width, because he’d told me one afternoon it made him feel like he was counting time.

I didn’t pick it up. I didn’t photograph it. This is the part where a stranger reading this will say, it was trash. It was nothing. There were a hundred boys. There were knots at a hundred laces and rings at a thousand caps. I can’t argue with you from here. I didn’t pick it up because I didn’t want to put my hand into the exact space where his might have been. I didn’t want to be wrong in the other direction. I didn’t want to take something that someone had left to say, I was here.

We still played manhunt for a while after that, not there. In someone’s yard, in the new subdivision that smelled like drywall, in the little woods by the creek where water skates zipped like handwriting. We always counted wrong after that. We always counted slow and ended fast. We got bigger and got smaller. We learned to drive. We left and then left more. Now, when friends suggest an urban explore, when someone invites me to an art installation in a warehouse that is beautiful and full of light, I tell them I have a thing and make my voice warm and not sorry. The truth is, I do have a thing. It is a room full of dust and a low ceiling and a voice that coughs once and a shoe that drags only when someone isn’t trying to be quiet.

If you need a moral, I don’t have one. If you need a clean line to draw a circle around the bad thing and make it stop, I can’t hand you that, either. We say we were kids and we didn’t know better. That’s true like most true things: at a slant. We knew the factory was a place where adults told us not to go and we went anyway. We knew cutting a fence is the kind of bad you can brag about. We didn’t know the precise weight of another person’s breath in a corner. We didn’t know how long not knowing can last.

People who read stories like this always ask what you’d do different if you could go back. It’s a dumb question. We always go back, in our heads, and we always do the same thing and sometimes we do it faster. If I’m forced to answer, I’d say: I would have stopped at the office door. I would have looked at Jamie and said, “No game today.” I would have taken the camera home and used it on the creek and a picture of a dragonfly on a shopping cart and our stupid faces. 

I don’t get to do that. I get to put it here and say: there are places that are empty because they are empty, and there are places that are empty because someone has learned to make themselves thin. If you are a kid reading this because you think fear is a thing you can carry like a trophy, it isn’t. It’s a magnet. It will find the iron in any room and pull.

I have the shoebox. I have the picture. I have a knot pattern I can’t untie. I have the smell of pennies when fear peels back the skin of the world and shows you the dark underneath. I have all the reasons you’ll tell me this means nothing and all the reasons I can’t stop hearing a cough under a stair.

That’s my record. That’s my whole story. I hope you don’t ever need one.",8,1757710742.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

Here the story:

I genuinely thought this of friendship but people tell me otherwise ( and recently I got feelings for my friend which I am not proud of, I intended this as friendship but it didn't stay).

We get along pretty well, yesterday she was complaining about her neck pain. I said to her massage yourself, she said I can't, I said If I can you can also. Then she said then massage me I was massaging her neck which I found odd that she asked me to do it.

I asked her to we go for coffee and she agreed to it. Today we went for coffee and there were three chairs, I sat on the right she sat in the middle and we put stuff in the middle. Then she said she can't hear me (but I was speaking very loudly 💀) then moved closer to me by sitting in the middle chair and moving stuff. She was laughing at a lot of my stupid jokes and some very perverted ( which I didn't intentionally mean but it came off that way)

I tried putting my hands on her arm cuz I am very touchy with my friends but not at all with strangers and she didn't mind it.

I find this a friendly hangout but I see people saying here on Reddit it's date, like jeez guys.

Hi  there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

If you leave any rude or critical comments ln this post you will be blocked 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 32 thanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone I loved and cared about 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I’m not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

I dont have any physical looks requirements other than I like natural looking women 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

I am an English guy 

If you leave any rude or critical comments ln this post you will be blocked 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 32 thanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone I loved and cared about 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I’m not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

I dont have any physical looks requirements other than I like natural looking women 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

Not to say that everyone is the same or has the same views about things but looking to get an answer specifically from women that see a coffee or drink meeting for a first date after matching with someone online. 

What are you looking for in that first date? What ideas are you expecting someone to come up with for that initial meeting? 

Some background it’s happened to me both ways. I have made more elaborate plans with dinner reservations and then going to a museum afterwards and have been stood up. 

I’ve also been the person asked to meet for “vibe checks” which were usually just coffee or tea and conversation maybe with a walk around a park afterwards, instead of the more elaborate date I planned. 

I started going with that instead because it seemed like a better way to see if there was any chemistry offline without either of us being locked into something for that time and would be easy to just leave after and be done. 

Now it’s happened that I’ve been told that “low effort dates” are wrong and men as a whole need to do better. 
I personally prefer something more involved for a date but that’s hard to think up something for a person you just met. 

So honestly looking for opinions and perspectives here on what women want or expect for a first date/ initial in person meeting. ",8,1757709766.0,dating,17,0.84,False

I didn't know how else to word the title but I'm looking for a best friend who's also kind of clingy and doesn't mind endlessly chatting away or pestering each other all day 🤭. I miss the closeness/clingyness of a relationship and I'm hoping to capture some of that in friend form with you! Something deeply connected and genuine. Live, love, laugh, toaster bath 🤗.

It would be great to meet people locally. As much as I would love to be pen pals, I'd prefer to move things offline eventually and start spending time IRL. Not opposed to finding friends from around the world though!

I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark.

I'm working night shift tonight and things are a little bit quiet so I'll be around for a while to chat! Feel free to join me and throw some music recommendations my way.

A little info about me so you know I'm not just a blank slate ready to get smashed to death by the hammer of life:

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Everton vs. Aston Villa: A Hamstring Havoc Showdown**  
*Where the Only Thing More Injured Than the Players Is the Plot Twist*

The Premier League’s latest clash pits Everton (5th) against Aston Villa (19th) in a match that’s less “title race” and more “who can trip over their own shoelaces first?” Both teams are nursing hamstring injuries like a bad breakup—everyone’s affected, no one’s happy, and the medical staff is probably considering a career in circus acrobatics. Let’s break this down with the precision of a surgeon and the humor of a stand-up comedian who’s had one too many coffees.

---

### The Odds: A Tale of Two Sieves

The bookmakers have priced Everton at **2.35 decimal odds** (implied probability: \~42.5%) and Aston Villa at **2.95** (\~33.9%). The draw? A tidy **3.28** (\~30.5%), because apparently, this league still believes in stalemates. The spread favors Everton by **0.5 goals**, and the total goals line sits at **2.5**, with “Under” slightly more favored.

What does this mean? Simply: Everton are the slightly more reliable sieve. They’ve won three straight matches, including a shocker over Manchester City in the League Cup, while Villa have lost four of their last five. Yet both teams are hemorrhaging players. Everton’s Nathan Patterson and Amadou Onana are out with hamstrings; Villa’s Ross Barkley and Alex Garcia are also sidelined. It’s like a medical convention in the locker rooms.

---

### The News: “Injuries” vs. “Relegation Zone”

Everton’s recent form is the stuff of mid-table miracles. They’ve beaten Brighton, Wolves, and even Manchester City, all while losing to Leeds and Roma. Their 4-2-3-1 formation relies on the midfield trio of Garner, Gueye, and Ndiayou to avoid looking like a traffic jam. Key man? James Garner, who’s as reliable as a British summer—unpredictable but *possible*.

Aston Villa, meanwhile, are the definition of “relegation material.” Their 0-3 loss to Crystal Palace last week was so惨 that even their mascot was seen filing for divorce.

I have a crush on my classmate who is really cute and I know her since 1stt year of my clg and she also have a kind of idea that I like her but I had never directitold her nor any of my friends (2-3 of them only knows). But still she knows obviously because of I way I talk to her (we talk rarely) and sometimes I had flirted also with her. But I had came to know about one thing few days back from one of our mutual friend that she (my crush )has told my friend sometimes she finds me clingy like he (me) try to be a part of her group and all (I'm not the part of my crush's group sometimes I try to hangout with them).
But I really don't know even it's true or not if is just fabricating it. Knowing I stopped myself from my crush and tried to talk with only when there is need like college only stuffs and all.
But I like her the most and tbh I'm a real green flag person and old school and I don't believe in this and don't want to be a part of playboy and fuck boy things.
And I really like her whenever our eyes meet we smile (obviously I'm not having crush on her on that basis).
Bro she is so pretty, her hairs , her eyes, her sarcasm ufff! 😩🤌. 
Ok so I want your all genuine advice should I confess to her not or should I ask her out for just a coffee or not. and secondly I'm also a CAT aspirant going to appear for CAT 2026 and I don't even want ruin that also because it is only my last career hope ig. But yes I know many of you will tell I should not ask her out for coffee or confess even sometimes I know that I shouldn't but what should I even do I can't even stop thinking about her or daydreaming about her and I can't even ignore her as she is my classmate also and how much do I try I will get to see her everyday it's and everytime daydreaming will continue so I can't avoid it. 
So I want a real honest genuine advice Can I make a vintage old school coffee dipped handwriting letter confessing that I like her (not too bragging obviously JUST GENUINE) or also her birthday wishes will be written as I was thinking to give it to her on her birthday (it's on April) till than I can try to just be interactive with her or can casually ask her out for the coffee.

But when was the last time you did a *check-in* on your relationship?

Relationships—whether romantic, family, or close friendships—are living, evolving connections. If we don’t pause to evaluate where we stand, it’s easy to drift into habits, miscommunication, or even resentment without realizing it.

Here are a few practical ways to regularly take stock of your relationships:

1. **Set aside intentional reflection time.** Ask yourself: *How do I feel about the way we communicate? Do I feel heard and supported? Are we growing together or drifting apart?*
2. **Have a monthly “relationship meeting.”** It doesn’t have to be formal—just a check-in over coffee where both people share wins, challenges, and needs.
3. **Watch for balance.** Is one person always giving while the other takes? Are responsibilities at home, work, or emotionally shared fairly?
4. **Track communication patterns.** Do you notice more positive exchanges or negative ones? Research suggests that healthy relationships have at least a 5:1 ratio of positive to negative interactions.
5. **Don’t ignore red flags.** If you feel stuck in cycles of conflict, withdrawal, or unmet needs, it might be time to get outside perspective.

Taking stock isn’t about nitpicking or keeping score—it’s about ensuring both people feel valued and connected.

If they have a long road trip ahead I'll prepare food for their trip because I'm happier with snacks and stuff on trips. When I setup an event I think of everything and pick the best entertainment and food spots. I dress and do makeup to impress. I set them up with gifts to take away.

But planning my birthday? I feel like I force fun. Like I can't seem to turn myself back on to be so creative and elaborate for myself. I'm very like whatever, I guess I'll do these things and hopefully it works out. If not I'll figure it out.

I always want to talk to others about all the things in my head and have them weigh in and help me process but will I even listen to my own self? I can't seem to journal! I open the book, try to set up the setting and make it nice such as a coffee shop in a new town, a beach, a cute chair in the backyard or even just backseat of my car. Or even just in my office. Like I just stare at the pages, write a few lines of nothing. And then I just dont want to do it. Like I won't listen to my own self. I dont know how to force me to listen to me. It's like, what's the point when it won't work out for me anyway? Even if I try to have a good attitude something goes wrong making me wish I just didn't even try.

I think listening to myself is the final piece to the puzzle of helping me enjoy this life experience. Why is it so hard? Why do I feel like I have to force it?

Has anyone else experienced this? I've met people who can give that energy that I love giving to others to themselves. And I love those people.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Astros vs. Braves: A Tale of Two Seasons (and Why Houston’s Porcelain Fortress Will Crush Atlanta’s Toaster Offense)**

The Houston Astros (-132) and Atlanta Braves (+112) collide on September 12 in a matchup that’s as lopsided as a circus acrobat’s retirement fund. Let’s parse the odds, digest the drama, and serve up a parlay so juicy, it’ll make the Braves’ 2024 playoff exit look like a summer camp fire drill.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why the Astros Are Baseball’s Version of a Coffee Machine

The Astros are favored at -132, implying a 57.1% chance to win. Historically, they’ve cashed 50 of 95 games when similarly favored (52.6% win rate), so this isn’t a “hot dog” bet—it’s a well-researched espresso shot of confidence. Meanwhile, the Braves (+112) have a 32% win rate as underdogs this season, which is about as reliable as a toaster in a monsoon.

Key stats? The Astros’ pitching staff leads MLB with 9.6 strikeouts per nine innings and an 8th-best 3.84 ERA. Their offense isn’t a juggernaut (25th in runs scored), but they strike out less than any team (7.9 K/G), which is more efficient than a sushi chef at a buffet. The Braves? They’re the MLB’s version of a “rebuild” spreadsheet: 22nd in ERA (4.43), 20th in strikeouts (8.6/G), and 21st in batting average (.242). Their offense? A middle-school science fair project compared to Houston’s polished lab report.

---

### Digesting the News: Atlanta’s “Rebuilding Phase” Is a Fancy Term for “Hope You Like Training Wheels”

The Braves’ 2024 season was a triple-header of disappointment: a Wild Card birth after a “brutal triple-threat double-header” (thanks, grammar!) and a sweep at the hands of the Padres. In 2025, they opened 0-7—like a magician who forgets how to saw things in half—and haven’t sniffed contention since trading away their All-Stars at the deadline.

Star pitcher Hurston Waldrep (4-0 this season) is Atlanta’s lone bright spot, but even he can’t outshine the Astros’ bullpen, which has closer Ryan Pressly throwing heat like a Texas BBQ smoker. The Braves’ lineup? Matt Olson and Ozzie Albies are solid, but they’re facing a Houston staff

1nfdx4v,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1nfdx4v/aitah_for_destroying_my_husbands_family/,AITAH for DESTROYING my husbands family?,"My hubby (30M) and I (35F) have been together for years and married in our own way—private vows, matching commitment bands, no church or courthouse. My hubby is the 2nd youngest of 4, all sisters, and we are the only ones to marry differently. MIL has never accepted that. She calls us “kids,” constantly guilt trips my hubby, and treats our boundaries like personal attacks.

I grew up with a narcissist as a mom & sister, and after years of trying I finally had to go NC, for my mental health, and to keep my daughter from that damage.

From the moment I met the family, MIL & the eldest sister (lets call her Brittany), they have judged me, given backhanded compliments, and looked at me as not worthy of their son/brother (you know the look I mean). The rest of his family are gems! His grandparents are so warm and kind, with Grandma claiming me AND my daughter as her own our first Christmas together. His other sisters have been welcoming, even putting mine and my daughters names with his, directly on the invites for their weddings and giving hugs each time we visit. His dad makes sure we are welcomed, and even goes so far as to make coffee for us when we visit and letting us stay with him in Hubbys old room so we dont have to pay for a hotel in town.

He has always been ""close"" with his mother & sisters. I admired it at first, but soon noticed the red flags: he told MIL private things that were not meant for her, gave her total access to our lives and even allowed Brittany to have a say in our finances. His hobbies are belittled, his dreams are mocked, and his achievements are overshadowed. My hubby is a gentle soul but I wasnt going to allow this to continue, boundaries needed to be set!  
  
After long & hard work, studying how to help someone else break generational trauma, laying out evidence like the finest detective, and showing him how they used the same narcissist playbook my mother did (easily making their behaviors SO predictable, that I was able to make a BINGO card of their words/tactics during our next visit--and YES, i achieved BINGO lol). Only THEN did his eyes open.  
  
While setting boundaries, we were of course met with resistance, in the form of narcissist classics:   
\-He told her not to make rude and hurtful assumptions about me after she said ""She doesnt know what its like to be a real family, since she didnt have one growing up."" And accused me of trying to rip the family apart. He told her to knock it off and she said ""You didnt talk to us like this before HER!""  
\-I told him I didnt want anyone knowing we are trying for a baby, as I dont want the stress of being hounded. He slipped up and when he asked her to keep it quiet, she called me ""controlling"" for keeping secrets from the family. She had already spread word to his sisters.....(Didnt think US trying for a baby was anyones business but ours.)  
\-Brittany also brought up my upbringing as a reason for his change in behavior, but this time, he wasnt going to let go without an apology. When pressed, she sent a classic “sorry you feel that way” text and has never taken responsibility. My husband made it clear that a genuine apology was needed to move forward, but it never came. After which, she accused ME of being the one texting her and stealing his phone. (Hubby couldnt possibly be a grown man with his own thoughts and feelings about how she was treating us apparently)

Weve been working hard together to build his shiny & strong backbone, and Ive been SO proud of the impressive progress he has made, even when he has waivered a bit, hes grown stronger from it! Our last family visit REALLY put him to the test:  
The 2nd oldest sister, lets call her Shelly, was going to be in his home state visiting from her home in Austrailia, and Brittany had also given birth to a nephew (\~10months old now). We planned a visit, but decided WE are no longer giving time to those who cant respect us. If Brittany didnt give a proper apology, then we would not be seeing her during our visit. Hubby told her and was even kind enough to give her a guide as to what is a REAL apology. Not shifting blame, not making it MY fault for how SHE made me feel, but taking accountability for her insult and owning it. This is where it turned:  
""I KNOW how to give an apology! I dont understand what you want from me! Ive apologized up and down and nothing is good enough for you! Why cant we move past this?!""  
In chimes MIL with ""Brittany doesnt need this, shes been crying non-stop. Cant we just move on? I dont like to see my babies hurting."" But why is Brittany the only ""baby"" being considered in this? Do my husbands feeling not count too, as one of her ""babies""?  
  
Needless to say, we did NOT see Brittany during our visit. But oh boy, did she try. She tried to insert herself into the brunch planned by my MIL at the family cabin, both ignoring the fact that we still had not been given an apology. We were gone most of our 2nd day, meeting gamer friends for the first time IRL, spending the day at a Ren Fair with them, and would return to the cabin that evening. That afternoon, she asked Hubby if he would be mad if she stayed the night at the cabin. He responded firmly that ""We wont be mad, but dont expect us to be happy about it either. We still havent gotten our apology."" As we drove back from the experience of meeting our friends in person, Brittany messaged us to tell us she had left and how it ""absolutely broke her heart to leave."" Classic guilt trip.

Standing our ground with Brittany seems to have MIL understanding that we will hold firm on our boundaries. But im still being accused of trying to destroy the family. I have tried to patiently explain thats not my intent. I WANT my Hubby to have a HEALTHY relationship with his family, because I know how it hurts to go NC. But thats going to need a few changes with MUTUAL respect.   
  
He is currently keeping LC with them and we are BOTH hoping we can work with them little by little to reach a healthy relationship with these two. We have both just learned what can be shared with MIL and Brittany, when they need to be told to step back, and when they should be patiently told to mind their business. Some of the family knows and are divided, telling us ""thats just how they are"" or ""is this really worth it?"" making us feel wrong for wanting to be respected as adults. Other members of the family are also considering LC/NC.

We still keep close with the rest of the family, as they have ALWAYS been kind and respectufl with us. We even plan to make it to the big family gathering for the Grandparents 60th Wedding Anniversary. But certain member have been put on LC or NC.

I have never said “it’s me or them"" and will NOT do so. I simply refused to shrink myself to keep the peace, and he chose healthy distance for both of us. So Reddit—am I the AH for “destroying” his family when all I’ve done is support my husband’s right to be treated with basic respect and to expect a real apology?

\*I feel like Im possibly being an AH because I know this isnt an easy thing to change, and its been rough on Hubby, but Im insisting on holding them accountable and us getting the respect we have shown them.",13,1757708904.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,6,1.0,False

\- I use my TV primarily for Anime on Netflix/Crunchyroll. After that would be western TV and movies. I also enjoy playing gorgeous single player games on PC with a RTX 2060 (No Man's Sky, Sub Nautica, Grounded, Stardew Valley, etc). Lastly I host games nights so we play Jackbox on PC and a variety of games on the Switch OLED. No sports.  
\- My budget is $1500 CAD, but $1000 CAD is preferable. Balanced audio/visual experience. I could buy the TV first with this budget and audio around boxing day. Options for both situations welcomed.  
\- Starting from a blank slate with only an empty glass TV stand that will comfortably fit a 75"" and Google TV 4K dongle, Google Nest Mini's, and WIZ LED lights. Some pictures on walls and one 5 frame canvas one piece thing (maybe it helps acoustics lol).  
\- I am long term renting the top floor apartment of a 3+1 story building. All windows are generally uncovered unless I am using the TV. 10ft ceiling's. lathe and plaster walls to the S + W. Exterior walls are brick. E wall is drywall. To the north is the dining room through a 1FT from walls 2.5FT from ceiling 1.5FT thick arch/beam thing. There is an apartment directly underneath mine and floors are thin. TV only sound has never caused issues with neighbors.

I went into IR as a sophomore feeling very prepared, made good connections with recruiters, but didn’t land any interviews. Maybe some leads down the road, but I'm not sure. Kind of a tough pill to swallow, but I'm kind of at a loss now. What do I do now? Until now, there has been a pretty obvious path.

For those of you who have been in the same boat before, what worked best for you after IR to land a summer internship?

I've got a solid GPA, resume, and leadership, but I don't think it's good enough to stand out in ""big bucket"" online applications.

* Did you move to LinkedIn/CCO cold apps?
* Double down on networking with recruiters you already met?
* Hit up professors/clubs for connections?
* Focus on smaller/local companies that don’t come to IR?
* Connect with employees of companies I want to talk with for coffee chats?

I’m trying to stay proactive and stay ahead of it, so I’d love to hear what moved the needle for you. I'd prefer to use Expo and Co-op Career Fair as a LAST RESORT.

As someone juggling numerous loads of laundry each week between workwear, gym clothes, and the odd coffee spill, I’ve found it to be more than just a basic detergent. It's a reliable ally in the daunting war against stains. With its advanced formula boosted with extra Oxi power, this detergent doesn’t just clean—it revitalizes clothes with every wash, surpassing most liquid detergents I’ve tried before.

**Design and Usability**

One of my favorite aspects of this product is its straightforward design. The clear cap is such a simple yet brilliant feature—it ensures precise measuring and pouring, significantly cutting down on waste. This might sound trivial, but if you’ve ever accidentally poured half the bottle into one wash, you’d understand the struggle. The container itself is compact yet feels robust, and at 92 fl oz for 65 loads, it strikes a good balance between size and weight. There’s a thoughtful balance in its ergonomics and practicality, making it easy to store and easy to use.

**Performance**

With its boosted Oxi cleaning power, I have to say I was impressed by the stain-fighting capabilities. It takes on everything from wine stains to mud with ease. I tested this on a coffee stain that had dried into a white shirt for two days (oops), fully expecting to have to run it through twice. Yet surprisingly, the first wash with this detergent did the job perfectly. It’s almost like a mini miracle every time it tackles set-in stains without pre-treatment. This kind of cleaning power saves both time and effort, which I deeply appreciate.

**Scent**

One surprising aspect is the scent. It’s fresh and clean yet subtle, which is exactly what I prefer. Overwhelmingly perfumed detergents have been a dealbreaker for me in the past. This one leaves clothes smelling just right—enough to notice but not so much that it feels artificial or overpowering. Sensitive noses in the family, including my co-worker who sat beside me when I wore a freshly laundered shirt, didn’t have any complaints at all.

**Pluses**

- Advanced stain removal without pre-treatment  
- 2X the cleaning ingredients compared to competitor baking soda-based detergents  
- Easy-to-use clear cap design  
- Powerful cleaning yet gentle on clothes  

**Areas for Improvement**

- The 6.55-pound weight could be a challenge for those with limited upper-body strength.  
- Liquid detergent can sometimes leave minor residue if you accidentally overpour.  

**Alternative Products**

Comparing it to other leading liquid detergents like Persil ProClean or Arm & Hammer Liquid Detergent, this product stands out for its perfect combination of efficiency and ease of use. While Persil tends to have slightly better results for extremely greasy stains, this Tide detergent is far superior in its handling of organic stains like mud and food. Arm & Hammer's detergents are budget-friendly but lack the same level of pure cleaning power, especially on deeply set stains. In this product, Tide manages to strike an excellent middle ground between performance and simplicity.

**Value Proposition**

Given the performance and the fact that a single bottle provides enough liquid detergent for up to 65 loads, this is an excellent value-for-money option. While premium at first glance, the advanced formula ensures you use less detergent per load, ultimately saving costs over cheaper options where you might need to double up on detergent to achieve similar results.

1nfdno5,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1nfdno5/grinder_150250/,grinder [$150-$250],"Hi all. I am looking to buy a new electric bean grinder. For the past five years I have had the basic cuisinart grinder and have been looking to upgrade. During my sickness brain fog i accidentally poured milk into my grinder and there is no hope in cleaning it thoroughly in the cracks and crevices.

For espresso I have used the Breville Bambino for the past few years and I like it. I make iced and hot lattes with light milk and light maple syrup. I like my lattes tasting like coffee. I get espresso beans from my local coffee shop.

My budget is $150-$250. I have been looking at the encore ESP but see mixed reviews - people seem to love it or hate it. Also been looking at the DF54 I have been researching grinders and looking on this subreddit for months but can’t make a decision. I am someone who takes a lot of time to decide on an expensive purchase but now need to buy one asap. I hate buying something expensive, regretting it, and being stuck with it indefinitely.

Any advice or guidance? I guess anything would be an upgrade compared to the Cuisinart grinder, especially because it did not grind fine enough.

I want to purchase one in the next 1-3 days because I make coffee every single morning.

Thank you all, appreciate your help!!",1,1757708279.0,espresso,4,1.0,False

I’m a final-year university student and have been job hunting for 9 months. Despite tailoring my applications and trying to network, I’ve only had one interview (back in April). Since then, it’s been rejections across the board.

A few weeks ago, someone I had a coffee chat with in March (at a Big 4 firm) kindly offered to pass along my CV for a role I hadn’t applied to. It’s been about 3 weeks with no update. Today, I got a rejection from a different position (which I applied to prior her message ) at the same company, so I followed up with her, just checking in to see if she’d had  a chance to see the CV or if there were any updates. I made sure to mention I understand she’s busy and that I’m still actively looking on the company’s job portal. She’s seen the message but hasn’t responded.

Now I’m overthinking whether I came across as pushy or if this is just normal.

My questions:

* How do referrals usually work? Do you get notified if it goes through?
* Is following up after a few weeks normal?
* Is it ever okay to reach out directly to senior people like directors or department heads (considering they’re the hiring managers a lot of the time) as a student?

Any advice would be really appreciated.

I start up my PC this morning, then walk away to make coffee or something. I come back Windows is up and things like Discord have started up, but I notice that blue circle loading cursor is on my screen. I can move my mouse around, but I can't do anything else. No  alt+f4s, no Task Manager, only furious anger.

  
2. I've had this computer for many years and it has never done this, but it probably had itself a brain fart and everything will be fine, I say to myself. I power the PC down, then I turn it back on figuring everything will be fine because I'm stupid. I don't touch anything. Straight to Asus UEFI.

  
3. I take a look at all the devices and if they're all still there. They are. My NVME Samsung 980 Pro with the Windows install is still there, and so is the storage dumpster Kioxia that I have in the PCIEX16 slot.

  
4. I look at the boot priority and it's empty. Press F8 and go check the boot menu and I also see nothing.

  
5. What if I just update the BIOS? The one I was running dates back to 2022. I'm not expecting this to do anything, but while I'm here, sure let's grab the latest stable update and see what's up.

  
6. Straight back into BIOS. This time, however, I see both of my drives in Storage Information and Boot Priority. The boot priority is correct, so I just get out of there and see if Windows will start. It doesn't. I see this screen: [Boot failure](https://platinumdatarecovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Boot-device-not-found.png)

7. I create a usb Win 10 Install so I can just check out my drives through the console. All the files on my drives seem to be there. The Samsung that has Windows on it has 3 Volumes on it. One with a bunch of storage marked as C: . Second volume is 100 MB and has a FAT32 format. The third is 500 MB and NTFS.

  
8. I go eat a sandwich and think about how much I hate computer issues.

  
What would be the next actually smart move here? If I run out of patience, I suppose I can just back up the drive with Windows on it to save the files I care about and just start fresh. It's SO tempting, but I'm posting here to see if anyone has any insight.",3,1757708107.0,techsupport,12,0.81,False

Gosto MUITO desses dois cafés da Five Roasters, o Honey Coffee e o Capadócia. Pra mim, seriam meus dois cafés diários, uma mais pro doce e outro mais pro ácido/frutado. Porém, aí que mora a dúvida: a Five Roasters trabalha muito com lotes sazonais, dificilmente eles tem um café em linha de produção como padrão deles.

Então, fica a pergunta do título: quais cafés tem notas similares aos da foto, são bons e gostosos e não são sazonais, ou seja, compro o ano inteiro quando quiser?
