He barely put on any weight the first 2.5 ish months of his life but we put him on a hypoallergenic formula and antacid that definitely helped with his throwing up but didn’t put an end to it. He had always had spurts of throwing up old brown blood (not coffee grounds) in his spit up before the formula but it was always occasional and the doctors weren’t too concerned they said it could’ve just been from latching too hard onto my partner. That went away almost altogether when we started the formula. The only problem is now every night for the past 4-5 nights around 3 hours after we put him down he throws up a decent amount of the same brown blood. We messaged his GI and we have an appointment in 2 days but he doesn’t seem concerned. Should we be concerned?,1,1736057326.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

This is a pretty long post as a heads up to everybody. I am at a loss on how to do a TLDR summary as everything feels like such a mess right now and tangled. 

This is junk account as my spouse knows my main one. I am having serious doubts if I am a good parent/husband. I am at a breaking point, which I thought I would not get to. I have done some stupid things, and I am trying my best to make up for it. I am just not sure what to do anymore. I am also writing this in an attempt to heal as it is the 2 year anniversary of the start of dad life. I feel like it i am failing, and its just going to get worse.

Please don't judge me in a bad way my wife and i were in agreement on everything except quitting my corporate tax job (Job C). I am honestly trying my best to improve. Sadly for me there is nobody in our inner circle who understands except my wifes step dad (Lets call him Sam who was a Partner CPA at a big firm). Sam currently has dementia or altimers now so his counsel is rare and far between. Due to this he can't really help me say what it is like with kids in public accounting, or how valuable a cpa is.

Some details

There are 4 sections of the cpa exam.

I met my wife in 2019 and was a fixer upper kind of guy. My wife is a clinical social worker who deals with a lot of in and out patient for the state. She knew pretty early on I was a good case for ADHD, I was sad inside and had A LOT of stuff to get over.

I was very hesitant to do therapy again for awhile as i had 2 previous ones who dropped me as a patient. Both b/c they would not take my ins anymore and I could not afford them. At the time I was very strapped for cash.

I was officially diagnosed with adult ADHD sometime in 2023.

Wife and I lived in a 1 bedroom co op on the 3rd floor. No parking, laundry in a building behind us with no way to get there except walking all the way around the building and through the man area of the complex, small ass bathroom, and no elevator so everything was a schlep. Space was tight as my wife wanted to keep a lot of her furniture when she moved in. About 800 sq feet

From 2020-March 2022 it was difficult for me to keep a job as could not pass my cpa exams since I had no clue how to learn with ADHD. My job (Job A) i got in 2016 and somehow was doing ok in, laid me off due to performance decline, and not passing the CPA exam. After this it was hard me to keep a job in public accounting (got laid off from 2-3 additional short lived jobs, lets call these jobs B1, B2, B3)

Sometime in 2016 with in 2 weeks of each other at the same time I failed my final CPA exam by 1 point, lost credit for another section of my cpa exam, and my younger brother lost his memory fully due to a medical procedure, and I broke up with my ex fiancé who tried to kill me. Needless to ay I was pretty sad went into depression. I got out of being depressed to being functional around the time I met my wife

In April 2022 I got my corporate tax job (Job C) which was laid back and chill. It did allow me to really work on my self and get better (mentally and physically). This job had real bad benefits, and I could not afford any therapist still. Switched to wife's insurance in Sept 2022 as we were married by now and living together for over a year.

I never stopped trying to get my CPA license as I kept trying to pass that one exam I failed. There were multiple exams failed, no shows cuz i lost confidence, and I was not coming close to passing until after my son was born.

The story

I started therapy in Nov 2022 with one who specializes in adhd and grief which I agreed to do, as I was trying to do anything to get over my procrastination, and sadness. In Jan 2023 with in 1 week of each other, My grandfather (huge pillar in my life), and my dad (another huge pillar) passed away. Few days later I found out my wife was pregnant and I knew nothing, and was no where near ready to be a dad. When my wife said she was pregnant I was in shock then numb for a few days. I wanted to be happy, but i could not stop being sad.

As you could imagine it got worse before it got better with the first trimester, me just trying not to be depressed and clinching to straws. Things were touch and go for a while with both of us working full time, my own issues and just trying to get through the first trimester. I was not present as I wanted to be.

Sometime near the end of the first trimester and second trimester I was able to get over being sad, become more present and really started being that person my wife could depend on. During this time i also put my co op up for sale as wife hated it.

When my son was born Sept 2023 It was amazing to me, and I felt actually motivated and not sad to go at my CPA exam in a different way that was more ADHD friendly. My wife was very supportive during this time, and we were both in agreement that to get out of our situation I needed to give my best effort to pass. We both agreed that studying 13-14 hours a week was the sweet spot. I helped with parenting where I could like cooking, diapers, feeds while keeping my full time job (Job C), and studying. I did a lot of the night time shifts and was taking in massive amounts of caffeine just to get by. (40-50 oz coffee, 4-5 expressos per day).

After my son was born my wife went on Maternity leave until April 2024. Because I was studying and working and not doing more my wife started to resent me. I took my 2nd exam early Feb 2024. My son was barely sleeping still and well I was usually running on fumes for a while after his birth. In Feb 2024 I went on Paternity leave. My wife and I agreed that I would study full time for the 3rd exam (one I could not pass). Right before I went on paternity leave I learned that my corporate tax job (job C) was a dead end , and they were eliminating the tax manager position (needed my cpa for this) due to budget concerns. I was to take on the role of 2 additional people, and not getting a raise/promotion upon my return.

Turns out my efforts were not in vein and during my paternity leave I learned that I passed my 2nd exam, and gave my best effort for my 3rd one. I went back to my Job (Job C) as just a paycheck. By this point I quiet quitted my job, and was in a very different mindset. After I got back I started to notice how boring and bad my job was, and all the corporate drama going around every time i talked to anybody. Everyday at the job it felt like nails on a chalkboard to me. I hated the work, the people, and begged my wife to quit the job for months so I could focus on my 4th test. This started to affect my studying for my 4th and final test but it didn't matter to my wife. I was falling way behind, and was unsure if I would make my test date, and the next hiring season for public accounting of Nov-Jan. She wanted financial security more than anything.

I started to apply for jobs as I could not stand my circumstances anymore. I was willing to give up my 10 minute commute for anything. I was given an offer for a job 60 minutes away (Job D), and I took it with out consulting my wife. I was honestly just so happy to be moving in a positive direction again in my career. As you could imagine this didn't go over well at all. Right as this happened my co op finally closed and we moved in with my moms house for more space and saving money. I promised my wife before this that if she couldn't tolerate it we would move out right away. Turns out moving was super expensive and stressful as we hired a bad packing service. We were in a huge mess with unpacking, me studying and starting new Job D in July 2024.

Job D turned out to be extremely bad and toxic as the partners yelled their staff constantly. After I got my first yelling I got a job offer (Job E) from another one that I applied to a week before I applied to Job D. My wife and I agreed that I would quit Job D and go for Job E. My amazing luck Job E was very a very tight nit friend group. In my position there were 12 people before me who all quit or were fired in 2 years prior to me being hired. Turns out I was unlucky number 13, and was fired with in 1 week. It is now August 2024 I am jobless, wife is extremely mad at me and on the verge of leaving me, and things are not going so well living with my mom.

After getting over being fired and figuring I can't get any lower than I am right now. I got my life together in a good way, made my final test date of 9/25/24. Gave it my best effort (after the test was done I had a gut feeling I passed due to my efforts) I could not get a job offer yet as firms wanted to see if I passed my final test. Grades were released 1 month later. I found out my final grade and after that I got multiple job offers. I am now in a very good and positive mindset very motivated and determined. The job offer that I took starts in on 1/7/25 (Job F), it looks to be a great company. My new job wants me to get a CFP license, and some other broker licenses. While I am in full study mode I agreed as it was nice to be valued. While waiting for my start date I have been studying for a CFP license, and unpacking, and starting a side business. Also during this time my wife has began to resent me as I was spending 2 days a week with my son, and really working on my self while she had to work. I did try my best to try and make my wife's life less stressful by unpacking from the move, doing more chores, cooking, etc... Nothing seemed to work to get back in my wife's good graces.

There has been so much fighting between my wife and since since I got my grade and this job offer from Job F. I am not sure what else to do. No amount of chores, or trying to talk or me taking this amazing job offer helped.

My last big idea was to try and get out of the dog house by unpacking and organizing enough to setup my sons bedroom. Before this my son always slept in our bedroom in a crib. I took this upon my self so my wife would not need to think about it, and would hope she could focus on this being fun. Turns out my wife has no intention to unpack from the move and settle a bit, and wants to move out again right after busy season ends. I don't get my first job review until June, and the CFP test I have to pass is in July. I found out she wanted to not settle at all today, after getting utterly chewed for putting a bra in the washing machine, suggesting we paint the room and make it better instead of the old ones which are dark and dreary, My wife also accused me of misplacing something which was later proven I didn't even touch an turned it into a huge thing.

After being chewed out for something I had no part in, trying to do something nice for, and laundry I am now realizing I maybe im making some very wrong choices. I keep wanting to believe that the more I do, better I try to help it will get better. I honestly thought building my sons room would be fun. Instead it just causes more of a rift between my wife and I. I am at a total loss right now, and have no clue what to do. I have asked for couples therapy over 7 times, but my wife does not want to do it. I don't feel I can keep fighting anymore with her about really really small things.

I also know if I do anything drastic it will send me back into a deep depression as I know it will hurt deep down to lose the person I love and possible custody of my son possibly. My wife has a track record of me not keeping a job Afterall. I am a very present dad who plays and loves his son. I just feel like I am failing as a husband and everyday repeats itself no matter what I do.

Since April 2024 my son has been in daycare, and those spots are like gold around here. Currently there is a waitlist 20 deep just to get in, as it is full this daycare is also 5 minutes away from where we live. Due to daycare my son is constantly sick so sleep schedule is vert erratic still. There have been some breaks, but they are far and few between. We just got over some stomach bug again.

I thought that by taking all he burden off my wife with the job or chores I would be able to reconnect and try to get out of the dog house. I am terrified of going into busy season like this with my new Job F. I really want to make it work, and this would be my first year as a licensed CPA in this great company. If Job F fails i want to do everything in my power to build a book of business (Since I got my grade I have gotten over 20 clients for my side business) to support my family. If I have to find another full time job until my book is big enough then I will. No matter the option though I will give my best effort.

I don't know if my best effort will fix what is going on. I set up weekly things for us to do to at least try and talk, be social. Most of my wife's friend group is 1 hour away from her, and her friends don't drive. My latest idea is adult play dates with our local friends (still trying to get in good graces), but focus on the friends with kids as parent friends could become great friends. (Being a modern day parent is hard as hell and expensive to)

any help or guidance is appreciated. Try not to hate on me to much. Im already pretty down on my self.",1,1736057260.0,NewDads,0,1.0,False

1htz5b9,https://v.redd.it/g1ur8b6b84be1,Advice needed regarding corals,"Morning fellas!

Got high on coffee this morning and decided to test the parameters. Here they are -

Ammonia 0 ppm
Nitrite 0 ppm
Nitrate 70 ppm
Magnesium 1500+ ppm
Calcium 500 ppm
Phosphate 0.5 ppm
Alkalinitdkh3.2 dkh

Tank is almost 3 years old

Fishes - scopas, blue eyed cole tangs, foxface, dottyback, damsel, six line, clowns, cardinal, dr wrasse

My nitrates have always been high. I have started vinegar dosing since a month (2ml/day currently) and they have gone from 100 to 70 ppm. Cyano problem has reduced. I'm doing water changes every week and gravel vacuum as well. Fish and existing corals are happy. My Ca Mg Alk values are high as well. Ca and Mg has stayed constant 500 ppm and 1500+ ppm for months and Alk is slowly creeping up. It was 9.3 dkh in May 2024 and now 13.2 dkh as of today. 

I only have a few soft corals as you can see and a Haitian anemone. All of them are over a year or two old and growing slow but well. So my question is -

1. Should i add some LPS corals to use up excess Ca and Alk? Which one would be the best?

2. Or should i wait for nitrates to go down significantly?

3. Or will the parameters eventually stable down if i add more of only soft corals? (easy corals only, as they're illegal in my country.)

4. While we're at it, can you tell me if my light settings are right? Currently have them at 

blue and cyano at 60
rest of the colors at 25 
white 0

I don't like the whole blue light look hence so..

Put on an extra layer of long johns and shirt. Went out and set up camp in the trees. I was nice and warm all night. Body sore as can be, but I dropped $3 on some Tylenol that makes it bearable. Went to sleep and didn't get up until the next morning when we all had to go to court. (Couldn't resist a little Alice's Restaurant)

The sun was shining on the tent when I got up making it nice and warmish inside. Gear packed. Hobbled like the old man I am back across the parking lot. Into the building. Coffee. Top off my phones a little. Reply to some of you.

I'm just unplugging the phones and putting my charger and cables away when I hear, ""Where ya going?"" ""As far south as I can get with this cold coming."" We get to talking. Must have been a good half hour of shooting the shit. I explain I'm traveling around looking for work, a bit about my time on the boat. Some history of the different types of work I've done over the years.

""You got a phone?"" ""Yeah."" ""I'm gonna give you my brother's number. If you make it down to Hattiesburg give hime a call. He's always looking for some help. You seem like you'd do pretty good, knowing how to read a tape measure and all. He's always helping people out and giving them a job. I'm gonna call him and tell him you're coming. If you don't make it no hard feelings. But if you do get to Hattiesburg give hime a call."" ""I'll have to see how the rides go, but if I do end up there I'll call him."" We shake hands and part ways. I didn't see him come in and the doorway is right in my field of view. 

Bathroom. Hobble my 80 year old feeling self down the road to the onramp. Gear down. Thumb out. 'Smoke some of that weed you have left. Nah, maybe tonight.' Hitchhike for a few. 'Smoke some of that weed you got left. Fuck it. Easier to smile while I'm out here in the cold.' One hitter. Thumb back out. 

I clear my head of all thoughts. Just a hitchhiker smiling at cars not thinking a thing. A truck goes by with some very distinct mud from the front tires splattered on the sides. 'Must have 4wd.' Still hitchiking. I see the same truck back at the beginning of the ramp. 'Theres no way there's two white trucks with the exact same mud on them coming down this onramp.' Dude pulls right up to me. ""Where you going?"" ""Either Hattiesburg or the coast."" ""I'm going as far as Jackson. Hop in."" Gear in. Me in. Away we go. 'Thank fuck! It's warm in here.""

He tells me the lord told him to pick me up. Prety common. He then proceeds to talk and tell me exactly what I needed to hear to get my head back on straight after the last two semi shitty days. We start talking about other things. Boat life. We're both mechanics. He had crack addicts for parents.  His mom sold him for crack. He's done a bunch of prison time. Got out got a job as a diesel mechanic knowing nothing about it, turned his life around, now he's doing good. 

He happens to be going right down the highway I would need to take to get to Hattiesburg on the south end of Jackson. There's a short jaunt from interstate to highway to the highway I'd need. He's going past all that. Drops me off on the edge of town. (Best place to be dropped) Gear out. Me out. Find a good spot where three lanes of traffic can see me. Gear down. Thumb out.

An hour and a half goes by. It's starting to get dark. Finish weed off. I move fifty-ish feet so a streetlight will light me up better. 'Fuck me I'm cold. I hope this ride shows up soon.

A see one of those smallish vans with a four cylinder in it go buy. They look at me. I look at them. They go by. Nothing new there. A while later I see another one going the opposite direction. 'Could it be? No, no turn signal. It's stopping in the turn lane over there. Hmmm.' It turns around comes back my way. Pulls uo next to me. 'Where you headed?"" ""Hattiesburg."" ""Ok get in."" I throw my gear in the back and climb in. ""We're going to Mobile. We'll get you to Hattiesburg."" The husband tells me he hitchhiked around Europe for years. They're cargo haulers. Older couple. She asks questions. He's hard of hearing but we get some talking in. I tell my story a bit. 

They drop me in Hattiesburg where I spied a great spot to camp on maps. Gas station. Big convenience store. I make a phone call to dude's brother. Straight to voice mail. I leave a message. Go inside. ""Do you guys take ebt?"" ""No. Sorry."" Back outside. Look up a place I can get something to eat with ebt. All Ive had to eat is coffee, a few handfuls of trail mix and a thing of cheese crackers. Staring at my phone. ""Hey many can you help me out?"" Look up. Walk over to vehicle. ""What can I do for you?"" ""I've got a problem. Do you think you can help me?"" ""What do you need?"" ""I've got too many ones."" Smiles. Proceeds to hand me $4 bringing my net worth to $12. ""Thank you! I appreciate it!"" ""Keep your bedroll dry!"" Big smile. They drive off.

I find a Dollar General a mile and a half down the road. Dig up a spot to camp nearby. Gear on. Limp down the road. Phone rings. ""Hello?"" ""Hey, how's it going? This is Joey. I got your message. My brother called me and said you might be coming."" Work history. Recent life history. Nothing can be done tonight. He'll call me tomorrow. 

Get to camp spot in the dark. The leaves are gone off the trees. Not a lot of cover. Drop gear and search for best spot to setup tent. Gear retrieved. Tent up. Tarp over tent. It will be fifteen degrees warmer than the first time I got good sleep outside the fertilizer/tractor place. But it's gonna rain starting at about 5am. I'm good. Got just what I need.

I walk to Dollar General. Maps says closes at ten. Get there at 9:20ish. Dark. Doors locked. Sign on door says closes at 9:00. Back past camp spot to gas station. I'd been craving pizza since I saw it at the first gas station. No ebt here either. Grabbed last slice of pizza and an orange soda for $5 and change. Still got enough left over for cheap smokes in the morning.

Back to tent. Shitty old gas station pizza and orange soda. 'Oh god this is good!"" Get in my sleeping bag with newly acquired blanket inside. I'm warm. It's not too cold outside. Story time.

1htz2kr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiangirlsontinder/comments/1htz2kr/stories_about_priyankas_i_met_through_dating_apps/,Stories about PRIYANKA'S I met through dating apps: Part 2.,"Well, after posting the first story of one of my first experience through dating apps with Priyanka (https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiangirlsontinder/s/FmcY2AAVOW) here's a second one about another Priyanka. This again was during 2021, when I was based in Pune.

One fine Sunday, there was a notification of a match on tinder, with whom I had an ordinary talk. This Priyanka, too, didn't have her profile pic, so given my last experience, I mentioned it to her either to meet the same day to continue ahead or reveal her pic/identity. She agreed for the prior and we decided to meet at Magarpatta Circle around 8:30pm the same day we matched.

I felt relieved with the agreement, realizing it could either be a good date or not much waste of time if it was a prank by any catfish profile. Someone was playing a prank. At 8:30 pm, I showed up at the circle on my scooter, and to my surprise, there indeed was a girl coming towards the designated meeting spot.

We shook hands, exchanged pleasantries, and decided to go to a nearby cafe on my scooter.

At the cafe, we ordered tea and coffee, and there was a little shyness floating in the air, given I am introverted by nature. 
She complimented me on my specs, which were similar to Harry Potter's. And that was a breaker as thereafter we ended up talking a lot about HP. Post the talk, we circled back to the Magarappta circle, where I parked my scooter, and we walked through the walkway in front of society, where there was no one aside from us.

Our conversation while walking was about our recent experiences, our work, and similarities in our likes for sitcoms and novels. It was then that she mentioned the reason for no profile pic, which was because a senior female at her office was subjected to a bully once a guy discovered her Tinder profile. Given that she was recently promoted to her team, she didn't want her image to be dragged down.

After our walk, we sat at one bench, and after much of a talk,k, there was some silence as we ran out of topic. During that moment, I looked at her and wondered how amazing it would be to have my first kiss, then there. But then I had such a wholesome conversation and thought not to spoil the moment with any such actions. A while later, the security guard whistled (post covid, there were restrictions), disrupting our meeting, and I dropped her near her building and ended the meeting on a great note with a hug initiated by her.

We had exchanged our numbers before leaving, and I mentioned to her that a description of how we felt about each other after this meeting would be a perfect first WhatsApp text, and she agreed to it. On my way back, I rejoiced myself with the experience, and once I reached home, I started drafting a text adding what I felt about the experience. I included most of the things I felt, my excitement, and also the temptation to kiss her when we were sitting on the bench. She was surprised by my text and called me the very next instant.

On call, she mentioned how she wanted me to stay for a long time and also accompany her to her place. I blurred that she could have just mentioned that, and she added that she got a feeling I wasn't interested in her. Her clues were ""the superficial handshake and the improper reciprocation of a hug"" to which I mentioned to her that I was just shy and wanted to respect her space.

The conversation there onwards took a different turn, from talking about our desires and kinks to her asking me what I would have done to her if I had been with her in that instance. I could hear her moans, and figured what she was up to, but continued on my recitation to not obstruct the flow of scenarios in her mind.

I slept peacefully that night but got a cold reply the very next morning to one of my texts. She had mentioned that on Monday and Tuesday, she would be occupied with something and we could meet again next Friday, but till Friday arrived, she just ended things, citing how ""I invaded her space with a text (How her day was?) on Tuesday, and that thing's just didn't align!"".

It didn't make any sense to me; after our late-night call on Sunday, we didn't talk that much to generate this feeling in her, but then I got acquainted with what ""POST NUT CLARITY"" was and realized it was something common in women as well.",2,1736056559.0,Indiangirlsontinder,4,1.0,False
1htz2c2,https://www.reddit.com/r/midlifecrisis/comments/1htz2c2/help_total_shock/,Help. Total shock,"Hi. I can’t believe I’m writing this and it may be jumbled but it will at least be a fascinating read for somebody. Please excuse grammar bc I’m just going to throw this out here as fast as short/sweet as I can. I need help, advice, literally anything to help me maybe understand what is happening. 

My (44M) husband just left a few weeks ago. Very shockingly so and pretty much out of the blue. I say pretty much, but there was a hint I’ll get to later. 

We have a blended family, my (43F) 3 kids from two prior relationships (2 from marriage ended in early 30’s, and 1 from nightmare of a “relationship” that I stupidly fell into right after the divorce) and his 2 kids (1 from marriage ended in early 30’s, and 1 from nightmare of relationship right after divorce). We married almost 7 years ago after a 6 weeks of dating. I know, I know, but it was beautiful and not insane. We had actually gone to high school together for a time and thus, were “friends” on socials but I don’t remember him. He did remember me. After he exited the 2nd relationship with child #2 bc she was cheating(is married to this person), he “hit me up” so to speak on FB. It was very sweet and he just asked if I’d like to get coffee or a drink sometime. I have never done any online dating and I didn’t really check my DM’s but for some reason I opened this one and for some reason I said yes. We agreed to meet after the holidays and I was still unsure if I would but he was polite and genuine and I was curious, bc I’d honestly never even noticed him on socials. We chatted a couple of times and met after the new year. It was pretty amazing. We did meet at a bar for drinks and some lady even saw us taking and said “You two are going to get married”. Anyway, it was pretty well love at first sight. But not the crazy kind of love or infatuation or hormones. We had so much in common. Our childhoods, our lives up until that point. We just got each other and it went fast from there. Tons of chemistry. 


I was in the process of exiting a long dead “relationship” with a diagnosed narcissist and addict, father of my 3rd child. It was difficult to escape this person bc he was abusive and I was afraid, and beaten down a bit but I’m tough and was holding my own, especially after the diagnosis. I always knew it was a him problem and I didn’t take most of his verbal abuse seriously but he had started getting a bit physical and the emotional-type abuse is always hard to not get cut by, even when you know better. At any rate- he was a huge problem but my new husband and I were no strangers to abuse bc of our childhood traumas, which will play a part later. I wanted to try and let my son’s father be in my son’s life bc I knew how hard it was without a father and my older kids from my first marriage had their father in their life. My first marriage ended very amicably and we are still great friends and support each other over a decade later. We didn’t go to court, we agreed on terms of divorce and he has always had our kids pretty much every weekend and times in between when he could. Same with my current husband’s first divorce- amicable and everyone has always shown up and been great parents, centered the kids, etc. So we bonded a bit over our dumb 2nd relationships gone wrong but that wasn’t the thing that brought us together, it wasn’t a focal point for us to heal from these- we were already pretty secure, or so I thought. Our kids are -18 (his), 15 (mine), 13 (mine), 9 (his) & 8 (mine). 

That I thought we were healed is on me. He was fine and I believed I was also. And I was as far as having any interest in that person goes, but what hit me like a ton of bricks was, even after knowing the situation I was in with a narc and having had some therapy to deal, I did have a couple of years of ptsd. It snuck up on me as extreme anxiety. My ex’s addiction issues made it eventually impossible to allow him in my son’s life but I really wrestled with that for a long time bc I was afraid of the trauma it would bring my son. 

I was abandoned by my father at 5 and then later by mother as a teen. My husband had been left by his bio mother and adopted by her ex-husband and his wife. He didn’t know his bio father until a few years ago. The quickest summary I can give bc I’m already taking forever to get to the current point. 

Fast forward to now. My husband lost his adoptive father not long before we met and he lost his adoptive mother 2 years ago to cancer. I lost my baby brother (13 years older then he) when he took his life in a shocking manner in 2020. More traumas to work through. We haven’t done any therapy. His parents left him a bit of inheritance, nothing major but in today’s world, it was a big help for us as we definitely struggled to raise a family of 7. We had rented a house since getting married. A nice house in a nice suburb and all that but it was corporate owned and they wouldn’t do a thing to maintain it. We lived there 5 years and really wanted to buy our own home. We struggled with having the money and fluctuating credit scores and once the pandemic hit and home prices pretty much doubled, it caused extra layers of stress. I needed very much to get out of this suburb. It was where I’d lived for most of 20+ years and FILLED with bad and sad memories. We made a plan (a few months before my husband’s mom passed, which was sudden, not expected that quickly- F U cancer) to move to a new city closer to the mountains l. My Husband picked the city. A year later it was time to go. My oldest was starting high school and I wanted to get her into her new school so that she could do all her HS years in same place and my younger kids would finish their school years there also. It was going to be our “forever” home. We had to wait for his mom’s estate to settle, ended up being 1.5  years, but we had no idea it would take that long at the time. We decided to make a little adventure out of it. We got an RV and moved to the mountains, getting ready to buy a few acres and build or remodel a house. His kids live at their mom’s, so no disturbances to their schools and day to day. Everyone is into the outdoors so the hiking and camping and fishing was exciting.

He texts me after the date thanking for a good time and awhile later he FaceTimes me asking if I wanna grab dinner in a bit. The dinner date goes perfect as well and he texts me again when I get home saying he had a good time.

1htyozb,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1htyozb/my_cousin_lucas_and_his_work_crush/,My cousin Lucas and his work crush ,"Susan Hoy was not the kind of woman you would think of an instantly attractive when you saw her. But if you spent some time with her you would understand perfectly why my cousin Lucas had a crush on her. She was tall, buxom and sturdy, with glasses and dark brown hair that were kept in a long bob that ended over her shoulders. But what made Susan particularly attractive to Lucas was the compassionate authority by which she led her team. 

She was a brand manager in an advertising firm and the brand she worked on was a name that many may even recognize. My cousin Lucas was hired by her during an interview and then she coached him on how to make buyers through advertising. She was the boss that almost anyone would want. If you were a low performer then she would pull a chair and sit down next to you like she was your best friend and when you did the job, she would praise you in public to make you feel accomplished. If you performed well then she would applaud you and though her team was only twelve people, they wanted to please her. 

It was not unusual that Lucas had a crush on her. He was in his mid 20s and this was his very first real job. She looked like she was in her mid to late 30s. But, neither the age gap nor the authority would prevent Lucas from thinking that she was desirable. But you must understand that Lucas can sometimes think from his balls and they can cloud his judgement. 

There was this one time when he was standing in his cubicle telling his colleague how ""hot"" he thought Susan was. When men praise a woman's charms then they can sometimes use words that are not very polite and it was this locker room tone in which Lucas was praising his ""boss."" His colleague was gesturing to look behind but when men think from their balls, they think from their balls. All this time someone was behind him at the photocopier making photocopies and Lucas thought it must be one of his colleagues. When he turned, he almost froze because there stood his ""Goddess"" concentrating on the pages being spat out by the machine, zoned out like she was somewhere else. 

My poor cousin Lucas! He wanted to dig his grave and bury himself. But Susan's face was so blank and her eyes were so zoned out that he thought she did not catch anything that he said. He was taking relief in this thought when she gathered her papers, turned around and walked away. This time she could no longer suppress the smile and Lucas wanted to once again dig his own grave. 

The woman was a born leader. In the rest of her interactions with him, she acted like nothing happened. Lucas was one of her top performers so she did not want to make it uncomfortable for him. The grace with which she handled him caused Lucas to fall head over heels for his boss. 

One night he called me and asked what he should do? I told him to back off and let it be a fantasy. But I sometimes feel that Lucas is a bit whack! He can not separate his fantasies from his reality. He decided that he would ask his boss out! That would be crossing a huge line so Lucas developed a strategy. 

He found a job in a rival advertising company that was paying him only 80% of what he was making. After that he submitted his resignation. Susan called him in her office and asked, ""What is this? I was about to send your name for a promotion and you are giving me this?"" She told him that he was a very valued team member and since she is about to send his name for a promotion, it is best that we throw this resignation away and never mention it? 

Lucas told her that he is leaving because he is interested in a woman who may not appreciate that he works there. Susan was confused. ""We are a reputable company with a very good track record, why would this women not prefer that you work here? May be you should bring her to meet us and that will change her mind."" Lucas thanked her and said that when the time is right she will know who this woman is. 

Poor Susan! She had no idea that the woman he is mentioning is in fact her. 

He left the company and took the job. Two weeks into his new job he went to visit his former boss and told her that the woman he has left this job for is in fact her! The woman was baffled. This was something she did not expect! He told her that he only wanted one date! He has taken a huge plunge only to ask her out and all she needed to do was to agree on one date. 

They met for coffee and Susan brought a list of potential employers for him. The woman felt bad that Lucas would leave such a well paying job and work for 80% and all due to her. She wanted to get him another job with similar money that he was making under her. Lucas opened up to her about how amazing she was and how he would like their relationship to continue. He wanted her to be his ""boss"" at a different level. 

She continued to try for his job and they kept in touch. They would meet to discuss his career path but those meetings were looking more like dates. After one of these dates she invited him to her apartment and they made love. From there on, he would visit her and sleep at her place. 

One day he invited her over to meet us. It was not long after that meeting that he proposed to her and she accepted. They got married and she quit the job. They both started their own advertising company and they run it together. He loves her and she remains his boss and he loved being under her

*Introducing Chip!*

*This sweet, handsome boy returned to AFRP’s care with his bonded brother Watson through no fault of their own. Thanks to their loving foster mom, Chip and Watson have blossomed and are ready for their forever home!*

*Initially shy, Chip hid in his foster mom’s guest bed, but has since transformed into a confident, playful kitty. He loves wrestling, chasing, and playing with Watson, bringing energy and charm to their foster home. Both boys have purr motors and enjoy being near their foster mom, often sleeping on her bed and competing for the best spots. While not yet lap cats, they adore pets and attention. Watson loves string, toys, and being brushed with a Kong cat brush, purring and trilling with delight. Chip gently taps for snuggles, enjoys birdwatching from the cat tree, and is also a big fan of the Kong brush.*

*Chip has inflammatory bowel disease, managed with a prescription GI diet and steroids, which his foster mom shares he takes well! He’s thriving and ready to join an adult adopter or family with cat-savvy kids over 15. It is currently unknown how he may do with other animals in the home as he has only been in a home with Watson!*

*Introducing Watson!*

*This talkative boy was recently returned to AFRP with his adoptive brother Chip due to no fault of their own after being adopted from us as kittens!*

*Watson is quite a lively and talkative kitty who loves to let you know when it’s time to play or get pets, both are frequent requests! Watson’s playful side often leads to daytime zoomies, and his happy trills are sure to bring a smile to your face. Watson has been totally happy playing with a simple piece of string, will try out almost any toy, and has recently decided that a Kong cat brush is the best thing ever invented - purr, trill, look sideways and meow loudly at foster mom if she stops brushing! Both cats accommodate their foster mom’s morning coffee time, but Watson can’t understand why she might later be on a computer instead of playing with him … so he creates his own games to lure her away. Watson also chatters (specifically) at the sight of crows.*

*Watson is bonded with his brother Chip and must be adopted with him! He and his brother both enjoy lounging on cat trees and towers, and they love watching ‘cat TV’-birds, squirrels, and people walking their dogs through the window or sliding door. They even show off their hunting skills by chasing the occasional fly around the apartment!*

*Watson’s preferred home is with adult adopters or families with cat-savvy children over 15. It is unknown at this time how he would do with other animals in the home as he has only been housed with Chip.*",1,1736054874.0,catsofcalifornia,0,1.0,False

I don’t have any work experience and I also dropped out of high school like 2 years ago.

They are for a limited time **offering 1,000 points to new sign ups** who create an account using [**this link**](https://virginred.mention-me.com/m/ode/bp7rh-alkesh-meghani) and make any qualifying purchase (of any amount!) through a partnered retailer

Greggs Sausage Roll - 200 points each



Greggs salad or Gourmet baguette - 500 points each

Vue cinema ticket - 1,350 points each



£20 Pizza express gift card - 4,000 points each

My mom lives 5 minutes from us and watches our son while we are at work two days a week. He is in day care the other three days. My mom is an amazing, loving, engaged, attentive grandmother. She still works herself 2-3 days a week. 

My mom is also a compulsive hoarder and has a clutter problem at her house. Every surface other than the floor is covered in small pieces of miscellaneous junk, much of which is hazardous to children for choking-related reasons. Think coins, hair clips, mini chapsticks, safety pins, bobby pins, containers of pills, gum wrappers, rubber bands. These are generally NOT on surfaces my son can reach (like the coffee table), but they are on every other surface. 

My dad lives at the house too. My dad is careless and clumsy. He does clean up, but not necessarily in a timely manner. If something falls on the floor he will not pick it up right away. Neither of my parents is neat. 

Several times, I went over to the house and found choking hazards on the floor, where they had fallen out of pockets or off of surfaces. I once discovered that my mom was using an open jar of coins as a doorstop (on the floor) and thought this did not pose a safety issue for my son because she was “always watching him.” 

I was very frustrated about this pattern and it did not seem to improve. I eventually told my mom I wanted her to watch our son at our house, not hers. She stuck to that for a while and then slowly, her time with him began to migrate back to her house because she had a plumber coming over, or she had chores to do and wanted to watch him while she did them, etc. 

Today, we went over to my parents' house and I found a loose button battery sitting on top of a cabinet. This is a shoulder-level standalone cabinet. The battery was not where my son could reach it. 

I told her that item was probably the single most dangerous thing a toddler could get ahold of and why, and I told her it could not be left lying around because it could fall on the floor. She told me I was being silly because he couldn't reach it, and it was only there because it was waiting for her to dispose of it in her e-waste bin outside. I told her there are some things you do not leave just loose around a house where a toddler is present, because stuff happens and things wind up on the floor. I told her to throw it away and said I did not want to find stuff like that loose around the house.

She took it to ""dispose of it,"" which entailed putting it on the kitchen counter alongside some other junk. I said no, you need to put it somewhere it can't wind up unaccounted for. If you want to put it in your e-waste bin, let's go outside and put it in the bin. We went to the garage. She could not access the e-waste bin because it was behind other junk. She put the button battery on top of a filing cabinet. At this point I said mom, please give me the button battery so I can throw it away at my house. She said my son is never out in the garage alone, which is correct. He is out there with her while she is doing various tasks while watching him. She thinks nothing bad can happen to him while that is the case and I'm ridiculous for thinking otherwise. I took the battery home and threw it in my outdoor trash.

My position on this is that no one is capable of looking at a baby 100% of the time while taking care of them. Part of watching a child responsibly is creating an environment where you can safely look away for a minute when you need to get something done. My parents' home is not compatible with that, I am not confident that it can be made so, and I am not confident that she will agree to stick to our house. I want to chat with her about how this can be improved, but I think we may need to consider putting my son in day care on additional days. 

I would appreciate your honest opinion on whether I am overreacting here.

So I was planning on going to Bohol end of Jan and was trying to figure out where to stay. It seems like there’s really good reviews for Bohol Beach Club and Oceana Resort, but they’re both farther away from the Alona beach area where all the coffee shops and restaurants are.

Moving to LA can be a big culture shock, even for those who think they’re prepared. It’s not just the traffic or the weather—it’s the pace of life. Coming from a quieter city with calm streets and a slower rhythm, I quickly realized how fast and unpredictable this place can feel.



  
For starters, the sheer amount of people everywhere is overwhelming. At first, I was taken aback by the constant hustle—people walking quickly, traffic speeding by, and the never-ending noise. Even when you're out for a stroll, there’s an energy in the air that feels different from anywhere else.



  
It took me a while to figure out that it’s not about slowing things down; it’s about learning how to keep up with the energy here. I’ve learned to embrace the spontaneity—whether it's a last-minute invitation to a rooftop party or a pop-up food truck I’ve never heard of.



  
And while I came here hoping to escape the stress of city life, I’ve realized that LA is the stress, in a way. It’s a city of dreams but also a city that demands you stay on your toes. From handling a packed metro ride to managing expectations at work, staying flexible is key.



  
One thing I didn’t expect was how quick everyone here is to jump into a conversation. I used to think people in bigger cities were too busy to connect, but here, it’s the opposite. People love meeting new people and exchanging ideas—whether you’re at a coffee shop or stuck in traffic, someone will strike up a chat. It’s refreshing but also a bit much for someone used to their personal space.



  
Now that I’m adjusting, I find myself more energized by the chaos than drained by it. LA has its own rhythm, and I’m finally learning to move to its beat, one step at a time. For anyone else new to this place, I’d say—give it time. You’ll get used to the buzz, and soon enough, you’ll find it’s all part of the magic.",5,1736053764.0,MovingToLosAngeles,1,1.0,False

I’m trying to make an order from the beloved CocoaPink because I am a gourmand FIEND and CocoaPink has some of the most delicious looking scents I’ve ever seen. However, as a girl with a total sweet tooth, I cannot narrow down the list of scents I want!!! Please help!!

Here’s some fragrance notes I positively adore, some I feel ‘eh’ about, and the ones that I don’t like at all!

• I absolutely love: chocolate, vanilla, milk, caramel, sugar, butterscotch, cream, marshmallow.

• I like: nutty scents, booze scents, cinnamon, woody scents (only if they’re sweet). 

• I do not like: fruit, florals, coconut. 

Sillage and lasting power are very, very important to me. I’m looking for gourmands that project like crazy and last all day!

Here are a few CocoaPink perfumes I’m considering.

* Black Chocolate (it’s so hard to find a sweet, rich chocolate fragrance without any fruit notes, so this lone chocolate scent sounds lovely but unfortunately I’ve heard this one isn’t very sweet or chocolatey? Please let me know your thoughts)

* Hazelnut Napoleons (I like the idea of a creamy chocolate hazelnut perfume, but I don’t necessarily want to smell like a chalky wafer…)

* Hearts on Fire Gelato (very curious about this one. It sounds so good, but I want to know if the coffee is overpowering, which I don’t want.)

* Pink Dragon (ok. I’m so intrigued by this one. I loooove cotton candy and cotton candy flavored everything because it tastes and smells like straight burnt vanilla sugar to me. But, it’s hard to find cotton candy perfumes because they’re always fruity!! So, I was curious if this one wasn’t fruity because of the sugar cookie and vanilla notes?)

If anyone has any input on the fragrances above, I would love that so so much. If you have any recommendations of other perfumes from the website, I would absolutely LOVE to hear them!!! Thank you so much. ~xoxo

The sofa often serves as the centerpiece of the room, setting the tone for the overall aesthetic. Whether you're opting for a [2 seater couch](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/munich-sofa-white) or a luxurious sectional, the right color can complement your interior design style and create a cohesive look. Here’s a guide to selecting the best sofa colors to match your home’s style.

# 1. Modern Minimalism: Neutral Tones for a Clean Look

For a minimalist or modern home, neutral colors like white, beige, grey, or taupe are timeless choices. These shades exude simplicity and elegance, making your [two seater sofa](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/munich-sofa-white) a versatile addition.

**Why it Works:** Neutral tones blend effortlessly with other elements of [contemporary furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture), allowing for flexibility in accessorizing with pillows and throws.

**Pro Tip:** Pair a light-colored 2 seater couch with a textured area rug or metallic accents for added depth.

# 2. Scandinavian Style: Soft Pastels for a Cozy Atmosphere

Scandinavian interiors are all about creating a warm and inviting ambiance. Soft pastel shades like blush pink, sage green, or powder blue work beautifully for a [2 seater sofa](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/munich-sofa-white) in this style.

**Styling Idea:** Add knitted or faux fur throws to enhance the cozy vibe. A light wood coffee table or shelving unit complements the color palette seamlessly.

# 3. Industrial Chic: Dark and Moody Hues

Industrial spaces often feature raw materials like exposed brick, concrete, and metal. Deep colors like charcoal, navy, or olive green are perfect for a two seater sofa, creating a bold contrast against the rugged backdrop.

**Why it Works:** These darker shades enhance the edgy, urban feel of industrial interiors while adding a touch of sophistication.

**Tip:** Look for contemporary furniture with sleek, metal legs or accents to match the industrial aesthetic.

# 4. Bohemian Bliss: Earthy Tones and Vibrant Patterns

For bohemian-inspired spaces, earthy hues like terracotta, mustard, or emerald green are excellent choices. A 2 seater couch in these tones adds warmth and blends effortlessly with the eclectic mix of textures and patterns typical of boho interiors.

**Enhancement Tip:** Layer the sofa with colorful patterned cushions and a macramé wall hanging for an authentic boho vibe.

# 5. Traditional Elegance: Rich, Classic Colors

If your home leans toward traditional design, opt for rich and timeless colors like burgundy, navy, or forest green for your two seater sofa. These hues bring a sense of luxury and refinement to your space.

**Styling Advice:** Pair your sofa with dark wood contemporary furniture, such as coffee tables or bookshelves, for a cohesive and elegant look.

# 6. Mid-Century Modern: Retro Tones with a Contemporary Twist

Mid-century modern interiors are characterized by their iconic use of bold yet earthy tones. A 2 seater couch in shades like mustard yellow, burnt orange, or teal can perfectly capture the retro spirit while still feeling fresh.

**Key Pairing:** Combine your sofa with walnut-toned furniture and geometric rugs for a striking mid-century vibe.

# 7. Contemporary Style: Monochromatic or Bold Accents

Contemporary interiors often embrace a neutral palette with occasional pops of color. A two seater sofa in a monochromatic tone like black, grey, or white can act as a canvas for bold cushions in bright hues like red or yellow.

**Why it Works:** The sleek lines and minimalistic approach of contemporary furniture allow the sofa to stand out while remaining sophisticated.

# Tips for Choosing the Right Sofa Color

* **Consider the Room's Purpose:** Light colors work well in low-traffic areas, while darker shades are more forgiving in busy spaces.
* **Think Long-Term:** Choose a color that you’ll love for years to come, rather than following fleeting trends.
* **Balance Your Palette:** If your walls and decor are already colorful, a neutral **2 seater couch** can balance the space. Conversely, a bold sofa can energize a neutral room.

# The Versatility of the 2 Seater Sofa

A 2 seater sofa is a fantastic option for various living spaces, from small apartments to cozy reading nooks. Its compact size allows for greater flexibility in placement and design. Whether you prefer minimalist, traditional, or bohemian interiors, a 2 seater couch in the right color can seamlessly enhance your home’s style.

# Final Thoughts

Selecting the best sofa color is about finding harmony between your furniture and overall interior design style. Whether you’re drawn to neutral tones for their timeless appeal or bold colors that make a statement, the right two seater sofa can elevate your space. Explore the world of contemporary furniture to discover options that suit your style and make your home a true reflection of your personality.

1hty5uo,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1hty5uo/the_best_seating_arrangements_for_hosting/,The Best Seating Arrangements for Hosting Gatherings at Home,"Hosting a gathering at home is both an art and a science. Creating a welcoming atmosphere where guests can comfortably mingle, eat, and relax often comes down to one essential factor: the seating arrangement. From casual get-togethers to formal dinners, the right mix of seating can make your event memorable. Here’s a guide to designing the best seating arrangements for your gatherings, featuring versatile options like [stools](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/bar-stools), [dining chairs in Dubai](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/dining-room-furniture/dining-chairs), and [bar stools](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/bar-stools).

# 1. Start with the Dining Area: A Gathering Essential

Your dining space is often the centerpiece for hosting, especially for meals. Choosing the right dining chairs in Dubai is crucial to ensure both comfort and style.

* **Formal Gatherings:** Opt for upholstered dining chairs to add an elegant and sophisticated touch. High-back chairs provide support for longer meals and create a cohesive look when paired with a sturdy dining table.
* **Casual Settings:** Mix and match styles for a more relaxed vibe. Pair modern dining chairs in Dubai with a rustic table for a contemporary aesthetic that feels inviting.

**Tip:** Ensure there’s enough space between chairs for guests to move freely without feeling cramped.

# 2. Create a Relaxing Lounge Area

For casual conversations or post-dinner lounging, a cozy seating area is a must. Incorporate versatile pieces like an [armchair Dubai](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/armchairs) to add a touch of luxury and warmth.

* **Armchairs:** Plush, oversized armchairs are perfect for creating an inviting corner where guests can relax with a drink or engage in a quiet conversation.
* **Floor Cushions and Poufs:** For larger gatherings, scatter floor cushions around the lounge area to accommodate additional guests.

**Styling Note:** Arrange armchairs around a coffee table or ottoman to encourage interaction while maintaining a spacious layout.

# 3. Versatile Seating with Stools and Bar Stools

Stools and bar stools are functional and stylish additions to any hosting setup. They are perfect for kitchen islands, high tables, or as extra seating when you’re short on space.

* **Bar Stools for the Kitchen or Bar Area:** If your gathering revolves around food preparation or drinks, place bar stools at your kitchen counter or home bar. Opt for padded or adjustable options to maximize comfort.
* **Compact Stools:** Low stools are ideal for informal gatherings and can be tucked away when not in use. They’re great for creating intimate clusters of seating around the room.

**Pro Tip:** Choose bar stools that match the height of your counter or bar and align with the overall decor theme of your home.

# 4. Outdoor Seating: Embrace the Fresh Air

If your gathering extends to your patio or garden, outdoor seating arrangements are just as important. Combine functional and stylish options to create a comfortable and welcoming space.

* Use weather-resistant bar stools for an outdoor bar or high table setup.
* Mix lounge chairs with portable stools for a flexible arrangement that accommodates various group sizes.

# 5. Flexible Arrangements for Larger Gatherings

For bigger parties, flexibility is key. Arrange modular furniture or stackable stools that can be moved around as needed. This allows you to cater to different group dynamics, from intimate chats to large discussions.

**Key Idea:** Position seating to encourage natural movement and conversation flow. Avoid blocking pathways or overcrowding any one area.

# 6. Combine Textures and Styles for Visual Interest

Mixing materials like leather, wood, and fabric can add depth to your seating arrangement. For instance:

* Pair sleek bar stools with upholstered armchairs to balance contemporary and cozy vibes.
* Use dining chairs in Dubai made from wood or metal for a polished look in the dining area, and complement them with textured cushions or throws.

# Why Seating Choices Matter

The right seating arrangement can turn your gathering into an enjoyable experience for everyone. Comfortable seating encourages guests to linger, while a well-planned layout facilitates conversation and connection. Whether you're hosting a formal dinner or a casual hangout, investing in quality seating like dining chairs in Dubai, stools, or an elegant armchair in Dubai can elevate the ambiance of your home.

# Final Thoughts

Creating the best seating arrangement for hosting gatherings at home is about balancing style, comfort, and functionality. By mixing versatile options like bar stools, cozy armchairs, and stylish dining chairs, you can ensure your guests feel welcome and at ease. Whether you’re in Dubai or anywhere else, finding the perfect pieces to suit your space and hosting style can make all the difference.

Whether you're throwing a casual get-together or a formal dinner, thoughtful seating arrangements ensure your guests feel comfortable and engaged. To make your space even more inviting, enhance it with well-placed [table lamps](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/lighting/table-lamps), elegant [hanging lights for dining room](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/lighting/pendant-lights), and statement [black pendant light](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/lighting/pendant-lights) that add a touch of sophistication.

# 1. The Classic Dining Room Setup

For formal dinners or intimate gatherings, a traditional dining table arrangement is always a winner. Place chairs evenly around the table, ensuring there's enough elbow room for each guest.

**Lighting Tip:** Install hanging lights for the dining room to create a cozy, focused atmosphere. Choose adjustable fixtures to control brightness and set the perfect mood. A black pendant light above the dining table adds a modern, dramatic flair, elevating your dining experience.

# 2. The Open-Plan Layout

In open-plan living areas, flexible seating arrangements work best. Use a mix of sofas, armchairs, and ottomans to create an inviting circle where guests can easily interact. Incorporate rugs to define the seating area and add warmth.

**Decor Suggestion:** Place table lamps on side tables near seating areas to provide soft, ambient lighting. This creates a relaxed vibe and ensures every corner of the space feels intentional.

# 3. The Lounge-Style Setup

For casual gatherings, consider a lounge-style seating arrangement. Use low-profile furniture like poufs, bean bags, or floor cushions around a central coffee table. This setup encourages laid-back conversations and informal dining.

**Lighting Inspiration:** [Pendant lights](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/lighting/pendant-lights) can double as a decorative element in lounge spaces. Opt for a black pendant light with a sleek or industrial design to add a bold statement. Pair it with warm bulbs for a cozy, intimate glow.

# 4. Outdoor Seating for Al Fresco Gatherings

Outdoor gatherings are perfect for taking advantage of your garden or patio space. Use weatherproof seating like rattan furniture, benches, or foldable chairs. Arrange them around a central fire pit, table, or outdoor rug to create a cozy focal point.

**Lighting for Outdoors:** Hang string lights or install hanging lights for the dining area outdoors to illuminate your space elegantly. Combine with portable table lamps for extra light and charm during evening events.

# 5. The Bar and High-Top Table Arrangement

For cocktail parties or casual mingling, high-top tables with bar stools make for an excellent arrangement. They encourage movement and make it easy for guests to circulate while sipping their drinks or enjoying finger foods.

**Style It Up:** Install black pendant lights above your bar area for a contemporary, polished look. Add dimmer switches to adjust lighting intensity, creating a sophisticated mood perfect for evening events.

# 6. The Conversation Corner

For smaller gatherings, set up a cozy conversation corner with a loveseat and a pair of armchairs. Arrange them in a semi-circle around a coffee table or fireplace to encourage intimate discussions.

**Lighting Accent:** Use table lamps to provide focused lighting for this area. A combination of warm tones and soft light enhances the cozy ambiance.

# 7. The Versatile Modular Arrangement

If you frequently host gatherings, modular furniture is a game-changer. Sectional sofas or chairs that can be rearranged to suit the occasion provide maximum flexibility.

**Pro Tip:** Pair modular setups with versatile pendant lights to keep the room adaptable. Install a cluster of hanging lights for the dining room or seating area that can complement any configuration.

# How Lighting Enhances Seating Arrangements

Lighting is key to setting the mood for any gathering. Strategic placement of table lamps, hanging lights for the dining room, and statement fixtures like black pendant lights creates layers of light that enhance your seating arrangement. Consider these tips:

* **Table Lamps:** Use them for accent lighting and to brighten up dark corners.
* **Hanging Lights for Dining Rooms:** These are perfect for spotlighting the dining table and adding elegance.
* **Black Pendant Lights:** A sleek addition that complements modern and industrial interiors.

# Final Thoughts

Hosting a successful gathering starts with thoughtful planning. The right seating arrangement, complemented by stunning lighting like table lamps, hanging lights for dining rooms, and bold black pendant lights, ensures your space is functional and visually captivating.

I have been purposefully single for awhile and told myself that when I did start dating again, that I didn't want to be the person always initiating things and making moves, which tends to be what happens for some reason. I noticed the conversation was dragging and it didn't seem like he was going to actually ask me out, so I sorta broke my own rule and strongly hinted that I wanted him to ask me out on a date. He took the bait and we ended up getting coffee a couple days later. 

The date went really well. He was extremely sweet and attentive, and was making great effort to get to know me. I could tell he was really nervous and he made a comment that he thought I was too pretty for him and that I was ""like a princess"" which was just so cute. Our senses of humor were also really similar and we had a ton of common interests/hobbies.

The end of the date was kind of weird though because he asked me if I wanted to do something else after coffee. I said yes, thinking he had something in mind. When he didn't say anything, I brought up that we could get a meal together. He said he wasn't that hungry. I didn't know what else to bring up because I'm new to the city we're in, so I waited to see if he had any ideas. He said, ""do we have a plan or?"" I felt awkward so I just responded with we could schedule something for our next day off and we could just end the date there. I asked if he wanted to go see a movie next time and he agreed. 

Our next date was scheduled for a couple days later. We only texted a couple times leading up to the day, mostly just talking about the movie and what time we wanted to be there. The day comes and we meet up. I immediately start chatting with him but he's pretty quiet. He still seems really nervous and is actually way more quiet than the first date. 

We get into our seats, watch the movie, and afterwards I start asking him how he liked it. He tells me he actually fell asleep multiple times during the movie and found the movie too weird (it was a horror film). I was a little disappointed because I thought it was cool and felt bad that he was so bored but oh well. At this point, we are walking back to our cars. I'm hoping he's going to ask me to keep hanging out, maybe get dinner or something. I didn't want to ask since I basically asked him out on the first and second date. I once again throw him a hint, ""What are you doing after this?"" He says he's not doing anything. We get to our cars, he asks me the same question and I respond that I have the rest of the day free too. He says, ""that's cool! Well......bye!"" And then we get into our cars and leave. 

He texted me later to make sure I got home okay and made a couple jokes about the movie being weird. He also insinuated that he'd like to see another movie with me. I told him I would like that and then he just didn't say anything back (pretty normal for him while texting, I've noticed).

The vibe I get from him is that he is a very inexperienced dater, and that he's pretty Introverted, and anxious. He also reminds me a lot of one of my friends who is on the spectrum. I'm interested in him and find him very attractive, but besides the comments he's made about me being pretty, I keep wondering if he's interested in me at all. He never texts me (I actually asked him about this during our first date and he said it's because he wants us to have more to talk about when we meet up, but it feels pretty extreme), doesn't make an effort to ask me out. He barely talked to me at all during the last date (obviously you can't talk during a movie but we stood in a queue for a long time and I was doing my best to be engaged with him) as well. I assume he was just feeling really shy, since he at least tried to make it clear he wanted to see me again. I know I could easily ask him out myself or ask him how he feels about me, but I am always the person who ""chases"" and does the heavy lifting in situations like these. It doesn't tire me or annoy me to be that person, because I think to get the things you want in life, you have to ask for it. But I, for once, want to feel that the other person wants me just as much as I want them. I really want to see him again, but I'm sure that won't happen unless I ask.

When I first started using it, I was skeptical about the Intel Celeron N4500 processor. I expected it to struggle with even the simplest tasks, but I was pleasantly surprised.

I spend a lot of time working on documents, browsing the web, and juggling between a few apps. The 32GB of DDR4 RAM really stood out to me; I had multiple browser tabs open with a few Excel spreadsheets running, and everything still ran without any slowdowns. I can honestly say it made my workflow much smoother than I anticipated. And the 1TB SSD? It’s been a game-changer. I remember struggling with loading times on my old laptop, but now, my files and apps open almost instantly.

One day, I had to take it outside to work in a park. I was a bit worried about how the display would hold up under the sun. But the 15.6"" FHD screen was actually pretty bright, and the anti-glare feature made a huge difference. It wasn’t the most vibrant screen I’ve ever seen, but for a work laptop, it’s more than sufficient. I found myself using it for hours, and it didn’t strain my eyes like my old laptop did.

The build of the laptop is another thing I wasn’t expecting to be as solid as it is. It’s not the lightest, but it's sturdy, and that’s something I appreciated when I accidentally dropped it from the couch. It didn’t even scratch or dent, which made me realize it’s well-built for daily wear and tear.

I also loved the variety of ports it has. One day I was at a meeting, and I had to hook it up to a projector. I simply plugged in the HDMI, and it was good to go. Plus, having the USB-C and Ethernet ports gave me confidence that it’ll have everything I need for future use.

The keyboard also deserves a mention. I remember the first time I sat down for a long typing session, and the full-sized keyboard with the numeric keypad made it feel like I was back at my desk, typing away. The keys have just enough travel to make typing comfortable, and I wasn’t fatigued after a few hours of working. Windows 11 Pro is another nice touch. I’d been using Windows 10 for years, so I wasn’t sure how I’d feel about the change, but after a couple of days, I found it intuitive and smooth. I haven’t run into any glitches or crashes so far.

As for battery life, I was a bit disappointed that it didn’t last as long as I’d hoped. One afternoon, I took it to a coffee shop for some work, and by the time I had finished my coffee and a few hours of work, the battery was down to about 20%. But, it’s not a dealbreaker. I just carry my charger when I’m out for longer stretches. All in all, this laptop has exceeded my expectations for the price. It offers a great balance of performance, functionality, and portability. If you need something that can handle the basics and a bit more, without breaking the bank, this laptop is definitely worth considering.",2,1736052664.0,u_No-Landscape-6623,0,1.0,False

1htxv1f,https://www.reddit.com/r/loveafterlockup/comments/1htxv1f/ditch_the_chicks/,Ditch The Chicks,"**“I Didn’t Think You Were Going To Take It This Far”**

Of course, a liar is going to lie about lying but Hunter, I think, sees himself as a Magic 3 juggler who will have to make one ball vanish.  They say the hand is quicker than the eye, but in this case, Hunter is actually the audience and Kate and Kaleigh are the jugglers, tossing themselves in the air at his eye level while moving at slight angles so that when they begin to fall, they move in opposite directions.  All Hunter has to do is trace their trajectory with his eyes, like watching the bouncing balls over song lyrics to make it easier to sing along, while he strings them along.  Little do they yet know they are shadowing each other, and by doing nothing more than smiling toothily, he is palming them up his proverbial sleeve without lifting either hand.  The lies he considers necessary half-truths, “I admit I’m talking to chicks, but nothing serious is going on.  I’m gonna’ show you I’ve been honest with you the whole time.  They know nothing; you know everything,” adds to the illusions that the primary three of them share; the other random no-counts are instantly dismissible – he’s “just getting fed.” 

Kate, who seems to be on speaker phone at the wine bar with friends Leah and Ryan, who are snickering like two friendly mares greeting each other while eavesdropping, keeps running her hands through her hair as Hunter’s admission becomes more involuted and blunt.  “I’m not blaming you, but you had your hand in this; you signed me up.”  Poor Hunter, who is only trying to keep straddling the fence, is now also guilty of committing ‘a love crime,’ presumably torn between Kate, “his landing place” and Kaleigh, his “twin flame.”  “These chicks mean nothing to me, I promise you” is the cornerstone quote of their relationship.  Kate needs a good ride on a horse to bring her peace, and along with Steve, the trainer, she’s grooming that horse the way Hunter is conditioning her.  Kate prefers to believe this little dishonesty is a ‘one-off’ still not recognizing her own in a scheme to take advantage of other gullible women.  It’s as if they’re both trapped in a mental house of mirrors, their reflections distorted and confused.

“Baby darling” has taken it two steps further by going bridal gown shopping at an antique vintage store with friend Ava and ending up buying herself a $100 ring.  Kaleigh addresses those naysayers who chide her for buying her own ring as haters.  Even if she takes Hunter’s advice to “rock that shit wherever you go,” after he’s curtly informed Kate, “They’re gone!” what is there to envy?  Her insistence on selling the only advantage she thinks she can hawk has added another 30-60 days to Hunter’s release date, and the sobbing we can hear behind the closed bedroom door might be the sound of Kaleigh’s realizing the stupidity of thrusting her melons and nether regions so aggressively on those video visits.  *I got no strings to hold me now Sir Jiminy Cricket.*  

 **“If He Wants The Curves, He’s Gotta’ Pay The Swerves”**

She grew up in a miniature Tara. but thinks “a white trash wedding is such a vibe,” so I’m guessing that’s why Savannah’s reluctant to pay for a wedding party for everyone else versus getting Bradley to fund her $20K BBL.  She thinks they’re on the same page in the same playbook, but Bradley wants “to move as slowly as possible” to build up stability and she wants the white picket fence dream.

There seems to be some amorphous inter conflicts between families – one such concerning Alissa, Bradly’s sister, whom Savannah considers her little sister.  Alissa is, apparently, a drama queen.  She looks like an angry bird with raptor-like vision under her slanted eyebrows - as conspicuous as her brother’s untrimmed tie-on beard that makes his hair look like a hidden rug to a cave’s entrance.  Little volatile sis needs to learn boundaries since she put her hands on Savannah which was the last straw for Bradley who wants no part of her or any other family member.  Naturally, for LAL, the boundary lesson will take place in public – Izzie’s furniture palace where Savannah and Alissa will be picking themselves off the floor instead of picking which coffee table fits the décor of their living room.

Savannah starts to dance around the conversation mentioning Bradley’s homecoming in 18 days when he will parole to his dad’s house.  When she mentions ‘boundaries,’ the fireworks begin.  Alissa is vitriolic declaring she was Savannah’s only support and her thanks for that is Savannah isolating her brother and, thereby, “digging her own hole with his family,” adding that everyone knows he’s only using her for $$ and will ditch her when he’s released.   *Who's zoomin' who?  Take another look and tell me, baby.  Who's zoomin who?  Now the fish jumped off the hook, didn't I, baby?  Who's zoomin who?*

**You’re The Only Friend I’ve Got Snoopy – Besides Cameron**

Underappreciated, undervalued, and beleaguered Sam wakes up the morning after the night before – budding man breasts, a curiously bulging belly adding to the circumference of his torso, and the number seven inked on his fleshy arm honoring perhaps the seven deadly sins, the seven wonders of the world, the seven samurai or chakras, a sight that should quell any apprehensions that Krystal has of him as a chick magnet.  He visits her twice monthly, lengthy rides either way, but this morning he has to make an unscheduled stop to make sure Rita, who’s been strangely incommunicado, is ok.  Rita is Krystal’s everything, her Queen who saved her from a drug-addled and toxic family.  Rita lost her daughter when she died 3 months after Krystal was arrested, suffering a double loss simultaneously.  So of course, Krystal is deeply concerned about her, albeit not enough to change her lifestyle to avoid arrest and thus save them all grief, although the parole lawyer Sam eventually did get may shorten that 7-year stretch.  Rita is what’s holding Sam hostage.  And he knows it, BUT “Hugging and kissing Krystal is electrifying; a profound experience each time,” yet curiously unfulfilling, thereby cementing Sam’s Sad Sackness.

He vapes as he complains about the overwhelming amount of his dedication (and without phone sex, too).  You share not only the inmate’s burden, but you’re made to feel responsible as well.  Rita’s visit was a bust; she wouldn’t answer the door, but she told her granddaughter she wasn’t feeling well, maybe she had a cold and wasn’t coming.  Again, and it abbreviated his time with Krystal.  The honeybuns and squishy donuts are snacks she wanted and not the silly little romantic love names I thought they had for each other.  Her security blanket will not fail her.  It will swaddle her with the focused concentration of a submissive to a dominant.  *Some people just suck the fucking nice right out of you*.  

**“You Look Like A Snack” & “I’m Hungry”**

MJ and Willie are Tongan – an island country in Polynesia, part of Oceana.  She’s the bi-lingual black sheep of a big family wherein her father has 36 kids – a record overtaken by Warren Jeffs of the FLDS with a still undetermined 60 children.  She grew up in Salt Lake City, was raised by conservative grandparents and eventually moved to San Franciso.  She met Willie, ‘a sexy Tongan’ when she was 21years old at her sister’s house whose first cousin is married to her older sister.  She was married for 13 years to Ami, and he was married for 9 years with three boys.  After his divorce, Willie fell into a drug-and-women deep end and caught time for possession with intent to distribute drugs, possession of a firearm, aggravated assault and forgery.  Divorced herself at the time and lonely in a new city, she found herself ‘catching feelings’ for Willie even with unresolved feelings for her ex when Willie reached out to her from behind bars and they began to ‘conversate.’ 

It’s her birthday so she saunters to the restaurant in leather pants wrapped tighter than cling film around a casserole dish to celebrate with her cousins, Sulieti, Cindy, and Cindy’s boyfriend, Peter.  It’s going to be non-alcoholic because she’s been sober for one year and on probation for 2 years for a DUI, having so learned to love the taste of liquor when she was 13-years old, that she consumed whole bottles turning into someone else.  She was caught doing a whopping 120 mph in a 45-mph zone and had to spend 24 hours in jail.  Tomorrow she’s going back to Utah to visit her mother who was diagnosed with cancer.  The last time she went, she got really drunk and slept with Ami, which Willie understandably didn’t take well, and in fact, went nuts, and, I believe, landed him in the SHU, and although he got over it in time, it inspired her to record their conversations so playbacks could allow her to hear his voice. So, she’s going back to the scene of the crime having learned her lesson, BUT “it’s been a whole year since I’ve had sex.”  *Do what makes you happy and if other people don’t like it, that’s just a bonus.*

1htxn5f,https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/1htxn5f/long_time_partner_has_a_lot_of_negative_energy_in/,Long time partner has a lot of negative energy in his life and family,"(Very long - TL;DR : what can we do about the weird negative energy in my partner's life? It has also been impacting me in some ways)

I have a question about being in a relationship with someone who has always had negative energy in his life and family. When we first got together as kids, basically, we didn't really know about a lot of this kind of stuff. Basically, as long as I've known him, he or his family goes through traumatic things. We've been together a long, long time, and even when we were kids, people in his family would have health issues, there have been a lot of deaths in his family, a lot of sickness, etc.

Throughout our relationship, we've often had weird financial problems. There is this bizarre thing that kept happening where both of us having a job would only overlap for a few months (the longest was a few years). Then, somehow, one or the other of us would lose our job whenever things started to get beyond just financially getting by. If we were able to start saving, building money, getting extra things, etc., something would happen to make us lose one of the household incomes and the person still with the job would have to pay for everything.

As I've learned more about spiritual things over the years, I started noticing that there are specific patterns in his family that tend to impact the couples also. For instance, one of his uncle's and his uncle's wife had to live in separate states for the final years or so of their marriage, because they couldn't financially afford to live together. They stayed married, but never got to see each other in person again before they each died, a few years apart. They were very much in love, but with health problems and financial issues they just couldn't get by living together. Then, recently, my partner's parents got sick at the same time. While one was still in the hospital, the other passed away. In his arms while he was trying to revive them, no less (the same thing happened with our pet a few years ago - our pet was sick and before we could get him back to the vet, our pet died in my partner's arms). Now he is taking care of his other parent and can't leave their side.

These kinds of things are common occurrences in his family and have been for as long as he knows. What's weird is that one side of his family doesn't have as many problems and the other side does. The side that doesn't have as many problems is financially a little better off (in some cases much better off) and they largely make it a point to not interact too much with the side of the family that has had more issues.

The first few years we were together, I just thought our financial difficulties were the growing pains of a young couple trying to make it on their own, no big deal. While he had decided not to go to college, he entered the workforce and is great at what he does. I went to college and am also pretty good at what I do as well. Neither of us has addictions, aside from coffee and nicotine. We don't get into trouble, and we basically just try to live our lives and work.

But his family's history of health problems is starting to catch up with him. Even though we are both still young, he has a few genetic health issues that have impacted him physically.

The thing is this: while there of course are issues of some kind in all families, my family largely is pretty blessed. I recently moved away to pursue my work field in another state, and initially it seemed like the financial problems and things were going away. The thing is, over the years, even before I left, I started distancing myself from him in some forms. We are best friends and love each other, but I stopped trying to get him to go places with me, exercise, etc., because it was just like pulling teeth even if we did have fun). Actually getting away from him physically made a lot of things in my life better, though there are still some issues. And we both know that aside from the weird thing in his family, we are otherwise also spiritually attacked by some envious people. But those attacks have not been working on me as much since I got physically away from him.

We've tried everything. We both have the same beliefs and have had experiences that lead us to believe this is definitely something spiritual. I believe there is possibly some kind of demonic attachment on him, perhaps in his family, but it seems that there is something different on him. For him being such a good person, and he really is, I've sometimes sensed a heavy evil around him.

At this point, I'm not sure what to do. I should also note that, when I was little, before I met him I received this unexpected spiritual message (I didn't know that at the time, since I was a kid) and it essentially gave me a physical description of him and told me not to partner with him. It didn't say why. I ended up meeting him about 2 years later, and even though I remembered the message, I didn't think anything of it.

At this point, the only thing we haven't tried is an exorcism.",3,1736051596.0,spirituality,3,1.0,False

1htxkbj,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1htxkbj/seattle_coffee_gear_has_me/,Seattle Coffee Gear has me 😐🤷‍♀️😵‍💫,"Hi again. I posted a few days ago looking for machine advice.  I was considering getting the new Rancilio Silvia Pro X - and was suggested maybe getting a Lelit Elizabeth instead.

I drove a few hours today to go see these machines in person. I didn’t actually care for the Silvia Pro X in stainless (all they had on display) and the steam wand is too long so the tip hits the drip tray.  It’s also probably a slight bit too tall for my kitchen. 

So, I asked about the Lelit Elizabeth. The guy helping me said « don’t do it » they apparently have had a lot of issues since Breville acquired the brand. Specifically that one. 

He suggested I buy a Lelit Mara X, a Lelit Bianca or a Diletta Bello.  

They only had one Mara X in each color for sale. I hadn’t researched them whatsoever so I went outside and watched a couple YouTube clips and went back inside to watch someone else buy the black one. That is the one I was going to buy.

I asked about the Bianca. Out of stock.

I asked about the Diletta Bello. Out of stock. 

I left without a machine. 

He said do NOT buy: Diletta Mio, anything Breville that has the touch screens, Ascaso machines (he said he can’t in good faith recommend the brand as it is drop ship only and Spanish engineering which hasn’t been around long enough to speak for quality of workmanship) He also said to avoid Rockets because the price point makes no sense for them - he didn’t even have me look at any of them. 

I am back to what feels like square one. I don’t entirely love the look of the three he suggested. The size of the Mara X is good - the knobs are…. A choice. 😂  especially the color. I know I can spend a few hundred more and buy a walnut wood kit which is the only thing that got me past the light wood on the black machine. 

If the Mara X hadn’t sold I would have one on my counter right now.  However - since I didn’t have my heart set on it and barely did any research - I figured I’d ask this community again for guidance.

Help please!!!  The guy was honest - which I definitely appreciated - but he also talked me out of machines I like. So it’s just so confusing.

I received a brand-new Breville Barista Express for Christmas, but I haven’t been able to pull a proper shot yet, and it’s been driving me crazy!

Here’s what’s happening:
	•	To fit 18g of coffee into the basket, I had to crank the grind size all the way down.
	•	I adjusted the upper burr setting to give myself more room and avoid being stuck at grind size 1.
	•	Despite these adjustments, when I try to pull a shot, I either get just a few dribbles or nothing at all from the portafilter.
	•	I’ve tried tamping lighter and even experimented with coarser grind sizes (almost suitable for cold brew), but nothing seems to help.

Since it’s a brand-new machine, I don’t think there are internal issues, but just to be safe, I removed and cleaned the shower screen. Unfortunately, I’m still stuck.

1htxcpy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Reduction/comments/1htxcpy/for_the_anxious_and_weary_4_weeks_postop_tips/,For the anxious and weary... 4 weeks post-op + tips from a germaphobe,"Hello! 

\*\*Disclaimer: I'm a healthy a 24 y/o with no relevant health conditions and had my surgery at a private center that exclusively does elective surgeries (i.e. not a lot of people & no sick patients in the facility). I also had an EKG and spirometer test before my surgery. 

Just under four weeks ago I got my second breast reduction -- my first was nearly 9 years ago. This one was what my surgeon called a ""radical reconstructive reduction"" – I went from a 34D/DD to a 34A. I have terrible germaphobia & contamination anxiety so, needless to say, I was very scared about the risk of infection, necrosis and other healing complications. While I know I am not in the clear – complications can arise months or even years after surgery (eek!) – I have been healing really great. At my 1W PO appointment, my medical coordinator took off my steri strips and replaced them. He told me that I was healing a week ahead of schedule and was impressed with my results. All follow ups with the practice have been similar. I'm lucky that the practice uses Klara and encourages me to send questions and photos of my progress. My incisions are pinkish and closed up -- with tiny bits of scarring left that will probably peel off in the shower over the next few days. All of this despite having an allergic reaction to the steri strips! I sent my practice photos and asked what to do and they told me to: apply benadryl to the incisions, apply cortisone to the surrounding area, take benadryl as needed, remove the strips entirely – and instead, clean the area twice a day and wear gauze or a clean cotton tank top under my vest. So...  to my fellow germaphobes, as long as you are communicative with your surgeon, follow their directions, take concerns seriously, and avoid reddit horror stories -- you will be alright. Infections and necrosis are rare and I am sure you are already being too careful.

Don't tell my therapist this, but I think my heightened concern about complications has worked to my benefit. I wanted to share some of the things I have been doing: a mixture of the explicit instructions of my surgeon's practice + extra precautions I take. I have not made any departures from my surgeon's directions without communicating first. Obviously listen to your surgeon over me if it contradicts your recovery plan!!!!

1. DEALING WITH THE WOUNDS... I purchased isopropyl alcohol wipes to clean the caps and openings of any lotions I put on my chest and sometimes wipe my hands with them.  I apply ointment to my incisions with clean 100% cotton pads. I shower every day and cleanse my chest with Hibiclens (surgical soap) -- NO rubbing/lathering, NO water hitting my chest directly, NO new products.

(And of course, I wash my hands before touching the area at all and rarely touch the incisions.)

2. CLOTHING/LINENS... I wear a clean cotton tank top underneath my surgical vest to decrease irritation. I dry my chest with a clean washcloth that I only use on my chest. I have been doing my laundry more regularly than usual, making sure I am using very clean towels and wearing clean shirts. 

3. SURGICAL VESTS: I purchased two washable surgical vests so I can wear one while I wash the other. I swap them out every 3 days or so depending on how sweaty I get (haha). I hand wash them with unscented laundry soap, vinegar, and a little bit of baking soda. 

4. I take photographs of my chest at least once a day to track changes and progress. I've found this really useful for my anxiety and for communicating with my surgeon's practice.

5. I apply diaper cream to my upper chest to soothe my skin when needed -- my chest started to break out a little bit before I learned that I could wear something under the vest and it has cleared that up completely! I also use arnica cream on bruises and achey spots as needed.

6. Even on my most lethargic days or when I am sitting down doing something, I move around about every hour to keep my blood circulating well. (Yes, it's a little silly to be watching a movie with my girlfriend and randomly get up to pace around my living room.) I make sure to take a walk every day and do some light stretching. 

7.  Because my vest was causing irritation & making it hard to sleep, I was told on week 2 that I could start wearing my vest for only 12 hours a day (vest on during the day and vest off at night)... When it is off I still wear compressive garments -- stretchy tank tops, light sports bras over tanks etc... I write down when I put the vest on in the morning and time my showers so I know exactly how long to wear it.

8. I do everything to be kind to my sinuses, immune system, and nervous system: keeping my apartment extra clean and dust free, drinking lots of water/vegetable juice/gatorade/kombucha, limiting coffee (mostly opting for yerba mate or hot tea), taking magnesium supplements, stretching etc...

1htxb7e,https://www.reddit.com/r/okstorytime/comments/1htxb7e/my_narcissist_coworker_made_my_life_miserable_but/,My narcissist co-worker made my life miserable but I came out on top ,"I am a first time poster, but I was chatting with my co-workers at my current job one day and shared a series of experiences I had with a previous co-worker. They were in shock! They said my experiences with this co-worker were so extreme and just unbelievable that it sounded fabricated from a TV show. So, let’s dive in! I work in HR. It is my bread and butter and I get a lot of joy out of helping folks out. I have been doing HR for about five years and it is what I got my Master’s degree in and I even now have a certification. I fell in love with my career path and I knew that I could really make a difference in lives of others by pursuing HR in the manufacturing industry since both of my parents were blue collar growing up. It was what I was most familiar with and it reminded me the most of my parents. 


So fast forward after graduation, I get an offer that seems unreal and it’s the most money I’ve ever made. I would call this soon to be nightmare-of-a-job, my first big break. I was so excited to begin! However, it didn’t take long for this experience to sour. I’d say the first few months were fine, but the training was poor and it was definitely a sink or swim environment. Both me and the nightmare co-worker, let’s call her P, were new to the department. She had only been in her role for about 2 months. To provide context, our HR department is about three people. An HR manager, and two HR Generalists who were brand new. One important fact to remember in this story is that it becomes very clear to me early on that P and the HR manager, who we will call B, are high school friends who apparently partied together and have known each other for quite some time. I was tipped off about this job opportunity by a good friend of mine that I finished grad school with. She was working there at the same company, but at a different plant a couple towns over and had put in a really good word for me. My friend, let’s call her K, had told me about some ongoings at my site and warned me to tread with caution, but NOTHING could have prepared me for the onslaught of emotional and mental daggers I took straight to my heart and brain while being employed with this company. My HR manager failed to let me know she was going on leave until P mentioned it to me some months after I started. Which was fine and dandy because life happens? However, when the time came for B to go on leave, she dragged out telling me the exact time and it was a little blindsiding. Communication was definitely not anyone’s strong suit in the department it would seem. This is about six months into my career there and things are ok at best. I was struggling to read minds and jump through hoops and I could tell the work seemed to not be evenly divided between the two of us, me and P. 


It wasn’t until I spent some time training at my friend K’s plant a couple towns over that it became very clear just how disproportionate the workloads were. I provided K’s HR dept my “training list” of all the things I would be expected to take ownership of. They almost couldn’t pick their jaws up off the floor. The two ladies I was training with just kind of looked at each other after looking at my training plan before finally asking me, “if this is all your job responsibilities (which was a very lengthy list) what on God’s green earth does P even do?” I was still pretty new so I really couldn’t say, but they emphasized that I was very much doing the brunt of the work and stated the work wasn’t very evenly divided. 


This sucked to hear, but what do you do in my situation? I was fully aware that the Hr manager and P were good friends. They were close enough to banter about topics that would be HR nightmares if it had been stated out on the floor and then reported to HR. One conversation in particular blew my mind! My co-worker said she had cheated during her undergrad. She said that her husband hired someone to do her accounting classes for her which would have been four or five courses. She said the guy worked out of California and was legit as she got A+s in all her classes. She shared this with me and my hr manager who just laughed and called her a dumb a** because they were that close of friends. P’s main reason for cheating was because she couldn’t pass the classes on her own and the accounting classes “were too hard!” I didn’t think this was cool or much of a brag because I had studied hard for my degrees and even had taken out loans to further my education. She bragged that her husband paid for her classes and also the man who completed her accounting courses. I was just appalled that she thought that was a flex. P wasn’t always horrible just 90% of the time, but one thing to note is that she was very careless and made lots of mistakes. Which mistakes happen for sure, especially in HR, but her mistakes were what I would describe as negligent and unacceptable. 


Each member of Hr had work phones, she virtually never used hers and would ask people to refrain from messaging or calling her. P would instead redirect them to me! Now mind you, I already do a whopping 90% of dept work and I am coming in to support 3rd shift, 1st shift and the small location across town no one would visit except me. I was delegated the off shift and the remote building since I don’t have children. This was deliberately stated. I was honestly fine with it. It didn’t bother me any as long as I was being helpful. I kinda enjoyed the alone time on these off hours and on days I worked early mornings to cover 3rd shift, I was allowed to leave earlier which was nice. 


Fast forward to when B goes on leave, I am half-baked trained at best. It was certainly trial by fire to say the least, but now boss is gone for at least four months and me and P are expected to support a plant with 400+ team members. Mind you, best practice is to have one HR person for every 100 people you employ to provide ample coverage. So now it’s me and P against the world. Out the gate I could tell the Hr Manager’s absence would be deeply felt. P started coming in late and leaving early every day. On top of that, she was taking two hour lunch breaks. Team members would ask all the time where she was. And I didn’t have an answer as I didn’t even know where she was because she constantly withheld information from me. There would be days she would take off or take half days and I wouldn’t even know she was gone for the day. She wouldn’t even send me a Teams to let me know or set her status to Out of Office. It was a constant guessing game. And the work load was piling up quick because we were down a person and to be honest, I was still learning and still doing my best to help people. P would take two hour lunches on the days she would come in and then I would be stuck unable to leave the office and having to skip meals or eat at my desk. 


I started coming in earlier and staying over to try and catch up. It was certainly starting to take its toll. Not only that, but I decided to pick up a part time job because things had still been tight since I had bought a house the year before. I was trying to make it on my own. I was pretty proud of that and didn’t mind getting the 2nd job to have some extra cash to spend on video games and extra things I just happened to want for myself. So I went from 45-50 hours at my regular job to a whopping 60 hours plus each week between both jobs. But I loved my second job so it was fine. I was adapting well, but burn out was creeping up on me. 


One day in particular I had enough. I came back to the office, and noticed a tall stack of papers were laying on my desk. With a sticky note very coldly asking me to do the work. This was a common occurrence and typically I just did whatever work P would give me to keep the peace. But it was just becoming too much! We were the same level as we had the same title and similar pay. Yet it seemed she thought she was in charge of me. I finally talked to her when she came back to our shared office and I asked if there was any way she could do the paperwork as my plate was already very full with my own work. I told her I didn’t mind helping her if her plate was full at some points (which it never was) but I explained to her it was just too much. P said to me, “it is not my fault that you have poor time management. And that you have to work two jobs to make ends meet.” At this point, I stopped being super friendly. I unsoftened my voice and I was very firm. I said to her that she had no right to question my time management capabilities when she was late everyday, took two hour, sometimes three hour lunches and would leave before me on days when I would come in before her. That’s when it appeared that I messed up by taking up for myself. P then screamed at me and told me she didn’t know what I was talking about. I firmly and calmly tried to explain to her and she kept screaming and throwing things on her desk while talking over me. She would not listen to anything I had to say. 


It was the single most stressful thing I’ve ever dealt with in my professional career. I never corrected her again the duration of my time with the company. The fact was, I needed that job and I knew I had no one to turn to because the hr manager was her friend and the person above the hr manager at the corporate level was friends with them as well. I was stuck. She didn’t speak with me the rest of the day that day she yelled at me. Most of the time even when P wasn’t mad, she was cold. She lacked any type of grace or poise when writing emails. Which I accepted as a difference in character since not everyone writes emails the same, but I feel her lack of empathy and her rude communication style when she was communicating, stemmed from the lack of respect she carried for me. But I doubled-down on kindness and wore a smile the best I could. She would go on to still be late every day and even started having me pick her coffee up from Starbucks every morning. I did so even when I wasn’t getting anything for myself. She would order it on the app and I would grab it for her multiple times a week. 


That week she yelled at me I forgot to mention that her husband made her buy me $50 worth of chocolate and write me a handwritten apology. She said she was sorry for screaming at me because her husband said that if she wanted to be a manager she couldn’t talk to people like that. W husband in that regard, but you shouldn’t scream at people in general, especially at work, especially in HR. I kept the handwritten apology as physical evidence of the abuse for later. 


Things didn’t improve necessarily because I was still doing most of the work and the primary contact for a staff of 400, but I got quicker and better as I went. I adapted to it but I could tell it was weathering me down slowly. People began to make comments like “say something to someone,” “Does P even work here? I never see her in the office?”, “What does P even do anyway?” The list goes on. People were definitely taking notice that P was never there and the hourly folks knew who to go to when they needed something. Those people I helped were the only reason I kept going as they were so grateful and so supportive of me during my time there. They knew how I had been treated without me saying anything because they saw it for themselves. Even plant supervisors had began to make comments about how I was the only one there. 


Around the holidays, P gave me the flu. She came into work with it and said she even thought she had it. I got sick the following week which didn’t surprise me much because I have an autoimmune disorder and I am on immunosuppressant medication. I was so sick and  missed some holiday events we were trying to do for our employees. Later I learned P reported me to the hr manager on leave stating I wasn’t a team player and she just couldn’t believe I didn’t help support the holiday company events because of the flu she gave me and … and she gave flu to one other person aside from myself! I was so upset. I had done all the work and kept the peace and I still wasn’t allowed to even get sick. She worked from home all the time when she was unwell or when one of her children fell ill. I didn’t mind. It happens! But me? Oh never. One time I needed to go to the dentist because I hadn’t been in awhile since I had just gotten insurance and she demanded I used my lunch break to cover it and then come straight back to the plant to cover. It was because she wasn’t planning on being there. And having no Hr coverage was unacceptable, but her kids would come first always. 


P could attend field days and all sorts of school sanctioned events and I couldn’t even get my teeth cleaned. She would make me move time off and come in early and stay later for her to take care of her kids. And I remembered my mom struggling as a single mom, so I always obliged despite knowing P wasn’t a single mother and knowing she had a strong support system at home. I always did what she asked of me to help her, but I had to ensure my hour lunch break was exhausted by my visit to the dentist. I did as much as I could to keep the peace awhile longer. 


Later, a new woman started at a site across town. I trained her on hr functions since P never “had the time.” I eventually told the new hire, let’s call her L, that the reason for this was because P said she would never train someone who made more money than her. Which is verbatim what was stated. P would lie to L all the time saying she was too busy or just couldn’t train her for *insert* xyz excuse. L picked up on this pattern of behavior and realized how fake P was quickly. L also realized when she would visit our office that P was never there. She began to ask questions and I of course told the truth. L was mortified and asked me, “how does P even have a job?!” I shrugged and told her I didn’t understand it aside from her being buddies with the head honchos. She would always kiss the right tail to get where she needed to go. And she would step on the little man to get there. She was ugly to team members, had a sour attitude about everything, and it was her way or nothing. She did not budge on anything that went against what she wanted to do. There wasn’t collaboration in our dept. it was her way or the highway. 


The new hire L became my confidant over the last few months there. I even cried to her a couple times. Of course my friend K at the other plant who helped me get this job was fully aware of everything going on too, so I wasn’t all the way alone. Later we would find out our Hr manager was promoted and she moved sites. So I learned it was once again me and P to my disappointment. I thought after the four months was up, B would come back from her leave and some structure would return to my life, but that wasn’t the case. It was just me and P again for however long it would be this time. 


The sad news was, I quickly learned we wouldn’t get a backfill. As we were needing to have a RIF (reduction in force) so salary jobs would be cut. My friend K from the other location was impacted by this and unfortunately lost her job. I learned that each department would undergo cuts, including HR. When I talked to P she said either me or her could be let go. I told her that it didn’t make sense because we had already lost B as she was promoted and that her leaving our headcount should have counted as our headcount reduction. P insisted that wasn’t true. She said it could be me or her, but she would always allude that it would be me to go since she was the one carrying out the terminations in secret for the headcount reduction. 


I was sick over this and I lived in fear for months afterwards. I began applying for jobs off and on when I had time since I was concerned I would be losing mine. I began to stress about how I was going to make it. P of course didn’t seem stressed. She got buddy-buddy with the corporate hr lady, let’s call her C. Her and C were gyming together and rubbing elbows. There were talks of pay increases and promotions headed P’s way. You can imagine how that made me feel. And the thought of P becoming my manager destroyed me. I just couldn’t allow for that to happen. I ramped up applying for jobs after that. However, management argued and stated P was not ready or capable of becoming hr manager so they gave it to my friend L. Around this time I had been interviewing with multiple jobs and it was going pretty well! I landed an offer I couldn’t believe that was significantly higher than what I was making at present. As work piled on more and more I couldn’t wait to submit my notice. However, I did ask my new employer if I could give a month notice since the work I did, no one locally was cross trained to do. They said that was fine and I tried to do the right thing in the end. P and I were in a rough meeting the day I was going to submit my notice. 


That week, a bunch of work got off-boarded onto me and P and we both left pretty defeated. I still hadn’t told her I accepted an offer and tbh she had no idea that I was job searching. P said to me after the meeting “gosh I could just quit.” To which I responded “well, I am submitting my notice today. So you could always follow in my foot steps.” P laughed but she looked at me and could tell I was being dead serious. She asked if I was serious and I said yes. She told me that it wasn’t funny and told me I could drop the charade. I told her I was serious and that I would submit my month notice officially today. She was rather dark skinned but she went pale, white as a ghost. Tears began to form in her eyes. Not because she was sad but because she knew the amount of work that would be dumped back on her! 


I had enough. I knew that what awaited me was better or at least couldn’t be worse than the hell I lived every day with P. I omitted so many details, but rest assured she was an absolute nightmare to work with. When I sent the email with my notice attached, I CC’d P and sent it directly to corporate. No one acknowledged it. Or tried to counter offer me or anything for three and a half weeks. I kept asking L and P if anyone wanted to know what it was I did  or if they wanted me to share a summary of my general responsibilities? But it was radio silence. I thought wow they never valued me. I learned later P slandered me to corporate HR, Lady C, since they were buddies and she likely couldn’t see through P’s BS. Wouldn’t be the first person fooled by her! 


But that was fine by me. I could bow out gracefully and be done with that awful place. I would miss my team members and L, but I needed to be free. P was also not in a good place at the end. She knew I was leaving and she hated it. She was mad L got the management role P wanted. And P was not happy with the 12.5% increase and promotion she got despite being lazy/absent or whatever you would label it. Mind you we didn’t have the budget to give some departments any increases but P got a large sum. P was so blinded by anger about not being manager she actually disrespected the corporate hr lady who helped fight for her promotion and increase despite P not getting manager. P still got a lot! 


P felt she deserved to be the hr manager and couldn’t tolerate L getting it over her despite L having many more years of experience and being obviously more credible. P also asked how much I was making at my new job. And when she found out I was making more than her at my new role even with her promotion and increase, she was so mad she couldn’t see straight. I was watching her crack and breakdown in real time just as I was about to make my exit. It was concerning and I even began to wonder if she would lose her job over her outbursts and negligent behavior. One of the things she did my last week there was accidentally send a report to the all employee email with everyone’s salaries listed on it. Don’t ask me how someone could ever accidentally do that! But she managed to do so. Her and the corporate HR woman C got into it pretty badly. P even began to wonder if she needed to look for another job. P had the audacity to ask if the place I was going to if they had any other open positions? I told her sadly no they do not. lol


 I did eventually share with them in a detailed email a list of my job responsibilities. They hit me with a counter offer and begged me to stay. They said they had no idea the level of work I was doing. And would pay whatever to keep me. I kindly declined. For my last three days there of my month long notice, they went from ignoring my correspondence about leaving to begging me to stay. It was poetic. I did not stay and I took my leave. P ended up in hot water after that and burned some serious bridges and I think management sees through her more now than they had before. Somehow she still works there. I don’t know how. But I still hear murmurs of tea regarding the crazy and outrageous things she does on a regular basis. 


On my last day, L took me out to eat for a goodbye lunch and since my friend was now Hr manager, she made P tag along with us. P refused to eat and just sat there with her arms folded the entire time. When L told P to cheer up we are celebrating me getting a new job, P said “we don’t celebrate quitters” and I just about choked on my bread in laughter. She was bitter to the end I guess. 


That was the last time I saw P, but me and L still keep in touch. L makes sure P doesn’t get her way all the time and has started holding her accountable which I love, but all in all I’m so happy and appreciated at my new job. It came with better pay and greater benefits, but ultimately, I’m not emotionally and mentally being tortured everyday. Sorry for the long winded post, but my colleagues at my now job told me I should share. AITA for wanting someone to lose their job after all this? Part of me is still not satisfied this person still has a job and is allowed to mistreat people and lay out on work all the time. When I calculated it, I think she was only working 25 hours a week most weeks due to her time theft, but we didn’t have to punch in as we were salary so she never got caught. But ultimately, she is at least not my problem anymore. I hate wishing poorly for someone, but to me, she is a liability. ",3,1736050482.0,okstorytime,4,1.0,False

I typically make a brew using 230ml water and 13 grams of coffee using my Clever Dripper. I only drink one cup a day because I’m sensitive to caffeine so I want to stick with ~12-14 grams of coffee per serving regardless of final volume.

Which would be the best Moka pot for me? Can I get away with using 13 grams in a 3 cup, or will it not function correctly?
