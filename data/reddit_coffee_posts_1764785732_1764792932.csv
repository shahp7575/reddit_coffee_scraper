I was waiting for my latte because the barista was new and kept apologizing to the milk steamer like it had feelings. At the table next to me, a girl in a hoodie was crying into her laptop. Not loud, just that quiet shaking kind where no one knows what to do.

Across from her was this older man, maybe mid 60s, glasses, tweed jacket with the elbows worn out. The kind of guy who owns more fountain pens than friends. I thought he was her dad until she said, “Professor, I studied every night. I did all the readings. I went to tutoring. I still failed.”

He sat there like the chair was holding him up more than his spine. He stirred his tea three times, stopped, set the spoon down perfectly parallel to the saucer, and said, “You did the wrong kind of working.” She blinked at him. He continued, “You learned what to memorize. Not what to understand.”

She started crying harder. Not dramatic, just broken. She whispered, “I do not know how to fix that. I do not know how to be the person who understands things.” He leaned back, rubbed his forehead, and said, very calm, “You only think understanding is a talent because no one ever told you it is a punishment.”

She looked confused. I was confused. He sipped his tea and added, “The people who understand things do not sleep. They do not rest. They carry every broken piece of the world and everyone asks them to explain why it is still broken.”

The girl stared at the table like she was seeing it for the first time. Then she said, “So what do I do?” He put on his coat, stood up slowly, and said, “Pass the class next time. Nobody thanks you for being the person who understands.”

Then he left. Not a hug. Not a pat on the shoulder. He just walked out into the rain without an umbrella, like he deserved it.

When my latte finally came, the barista apologized again. I told her it was fine. My hands were shaking a little, which is stupid because it was not even my grade. It was not even my life. I have not stopped thinking about that line.

1pdezf3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1pdezf3/i_feel_like_my_friend_doesnt_appreciate_me_enough/,"I feel like my friend doesn’t appreciate me enough, what do I do?","So around 6 months ago, l started texting this one girl, we’ll call her Melon. So, I started texting her because we were mutuals and I wanted to be her friend. The reason I started texting her was because she reminded me of this one girl I used to be friends with (We’ll call this girl Jelly Bean.) The reason me and Jelly Bean stopped being friends was because she dropped me, and I was very hurt by it because I got attached to her quickly, so I missed her very deeply. So, that’s the reason why I started being friends with Melon because she reminded me of Jelly Bean. 

Later on, I realized that Melon was actually best friends with Jelly Bean, and I was shocked but I never told Melon anything about Jelly Bean or what she did to me. Fast forward a few months later, Jelly Bean drops Melon and I tell Melon what happened with me and Jelly Bean because I still didn’t tell Melon at that point of time. Melon already knew that I was friends with Jelly Bean because Jelly Bean told her. I tried my best to comfort Melon because Melon was very upset that Jelly Bean dropped her. At this time, I was very attached to Melon, I really admired her. I have problems with me getting attached too quickly. So after Jelly Bean drops Melon, Melon starts being friends with this girl named Vanilla (Not her real name.) I didn’t know at the time, but Melon liked Vanilla and one day, Melon texts me and she is like “The girl I like likes me back!”, and I was really upset since I was kind of interested into Melon at the time, and plus she only knew Vanilla for barely a month, so I was kind of annoyed because before Melon and Vanilla started dating, Melon would kind of pick Vanilla over me and I knew Melon longer than she knew Vanilla. I understand that I shouldn’t be jealous, but it’s so annoying whenever you try so hard for someone and they pick someone else. As well, even when they were friends, Melon would always post cute videos for Vanilla and she never would post me. She only really posted 2 videos for me and a million for Vanilla. I made videos for Melon tho, and I posted her like 5 times. I know that may not seem important, but if you can’t even post me but you can post someone you haven’t known for a long period of time, I’m obviously going to be upset. 

Okay so basically after Jelly Bean dropped Melon, Melon starts being friends with Coffee (not her real name), and Coffee and Jelly Bean were BEST FRIENDS. But Jelly Bean dropped Coffee, so Melon decides to be friends with Coffee, and mind you they start texting for one day and Melon starts posting Coffee even though she knew her for one day, yet she can’t even post me? Anyways, so later on Melon and Jelly Bean start being friends again because Melon wrote her this long paragraph about how she misses her and wants to be her friend again. So they start being friends again, but Melon feels guilty because she doesn’t know how Coffee will react and that she feels bad for Coffee and “me”, but I don’t think she even felt bad for me. I think she only felt bad for Coffee and what would Coffee think.

Anyways, one day, Coffee pretended to make a fake account to talk to Jelly Bean because she really misses Jelly Bean and Coffee was posting about talking to Jelly Bean on her story. So, Melon decides to tell Jelly Bean that Coffee is texting Jelly Bean on a fake account, which is honestly kind of makes me think that Melon is telling Jelly Bean what I said about her. I don’t want Jelly Bean to have any information about me. Also, I would say specifically “DO NOT TALK ABOUT JELLY BEAN WITH ME.” And yet, Melon would still tell me about Jelly Bean, and she says “I know you don’t want to hear about Jelly Bean but…” and it is actually so annoying. Another reason why I want to drop Melon is because she is friends with Jelly Bean, and I’ve been trying to move on and forget about Jelly Bean but Melon being friends with Jelly Bean is a daily reminder of what I lost. 

Back to Vanilla, so when Vanilla and Melon were dating Melon would get very jealous because Vanilla had this one friend that she would post a lot. Melon would say that Vanilla was trying to jealous bait her so Melon decided to use me to make Vanilla jealous, which I don’t really know how to feel about that, but eventually they broke up. Melon would never stop talking about Vanilla and at that time I was going through alot and I would still try my best to comfort Melon, but eventually it got tiring because it would always be about Vanilla. As well, I would tell her about my problems but I feel like she would say “ohh im so sorry” and then go back to start talking about Vanilla which is annoying, I understand I should be more understanding because she did loose her girlfriend but I just feel as if she doesn’t care about me. Also, Melon once said that Vanilla played her but then she legit posted Vanilla later (because they’re friends).

Fast forward a bit, we aren’t as close and the only time she texts me is when I text first. We were matching too, but then she unmatched with me and a few days later she legit started to match with someone else, and she made a highlight for someone. Mind you, she never even made a highlight for me, which kinda upsets me. I just started ghosting her now because she wouldn’t answer me even when she was online and I was done. 

Anyways, what do I do? I just feel like she doesn’t appreciate me enough, and I know she is online but I don’t really care about that. I just want to know what to do, I don’t want to drop her because I will feel bad, and I feel like I will miss her too much because im attached (though, I’m not that attached to her), but if I tell her how I feel, I feel like it will just damage our friendship. Sorry if stuff doesn’t make sense, if nothing makes sense, just tell me and I will clear it up.

Is it practical and easy to wash? Not at all.

1pdevy8,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1pdevy8/witness_to_the_fall/,Witness to the Fall,"We used to watch the snow fall. Together. 

It was calming and peaceful. Watching the dim afternoon light glint through the trees gave a type of tranquility that felt almost sinful to feel. I remember you would catch them on your black hoodie sleeve to examine the fine details of the seemingly unnatural geometric patterns as clearly as you possibly could.

“Few things in life make me feel like we’re living in a simulation.” You would say, this conversation forever on repeat. I never minded it, there was such a peace between us.

“What do you mean?” I entertained your ramblings about the universe while sipping lukewarm coffee. 

“Where else in nature do you find such perfection? Ice always brings out such true beauty from the world.” You slowly traced out your favorite snowflake pattern on the frosted glass table almost unconsciously while you spoke. 

For a brief moment you would stare at it until your hand retreated back into its sleeve for warmth. A stellar dendrite you called it. The same one you had tattooed on your back. Your eyes met mine once again, the dim morning light sparked the hazel shading of them while revealing your softly freckled portrait. You were beautiful.

This life we had built together was quiet yet satisfying. Five years we spent together in this cabin at the edge of the woods; every winter bringing a soft blanket of wonder that always grew within you. Not to say that life was always perfect, like any relationship we had our hardships but that didn’t stop us from crafting our own slice of perfection. 

That was until you were gone.

The first morning I woke up without you I begged for it to be a nightmare. To my heart break, time continued to march on. The house felt empty with no sign of your presence within it. Walls stripped bare from what you left behind with a silent ambiance accompanying it. I waited for the universe to bring peace for two months but it never came. Slowly I began to despise being alone inside so I began to drink; at first I had a few small drinks a day but that amount quickly increased. It was the only thing that pushed away the ghost of our forest. I longed to step outside and once again walk our trails through the trees but alas; the snow continued to mock me. 

Finally late February arrived and the snow began to clear. I bundled myself up, took a quick shot of whiskey for warmth, then began my trek outwards. The air was cold and harsh in my lungs but I finally felt calm. Hours passed and the woods grew thick around me. Soon even the trails began to bring back haunted memories that I wished to repress; so I made the decision to continue into the unmarked grounds. Not my best move but I wasn’t in the clearest head space to begin with. 

Daylight began to quickly fade around me and a slow insult of white sleet continued to fall down. Cold began to sneak its way into my bones and I fumbled for the flask in my breast pocket. The only provision I decided to bring with me and the brown liquor burned its way down my throat. Originally I planned to retrace my footprints back to the trail but the weather hide away my undiscovered path. To no surprise, I was lost. 

Hours went by while I listened to the soft gentle crunch of the snow beneath me. The sun had long since set with only blue moonlight reflecting off the snow. My throat became increasing dry and I dropped to my knees. I began to shovel handfuls of snow into my mouth and the cracked corners of my mouth stung from the cold. I coughed hard into my hands while I shoved it down that what little I had in my stomach forced its way out. My body convulsed violently and I fell face first into the pile of stomach bile ahead of me. Tears slipped their way out and I cried softly to myself.

I rolled onto my back and glanced up at the stars. To my left there was a soft snap of a twig, I slowly moved my head over expecting to see a deer or hopefully a bear to end my suffering. What stood in the tree line was nothing I would have ever expected. A tall black figure stood there, watching me grovel. It raised a thin lanky arm and beckoned me towards it. In my confused state I pushed myself up. We stared at each other for a long moment then the figure turned and disappeared farther into my wooded prison.

“Hey!” I yelled after it, my voice quivering, “Please…please help me.” I cried and I slowly began to chase after it. My legs wobbled underneath me as I tried over logs and roots. The figure came back into my sight about 10 feet ahead of me and I continued to call after it. Its back remained static at me and I reached out one hand towards him. For a moment I thought I had found my savior but then, just as the snow had done so around me, I fell.

The world fell from under me.

The sky reached even further away from me. 

There I plummeted, flipping head over heels repeatedly into the ever growing darkness. My fall ended whenever my side made sudden contact with a thin sheet of ice. It cracked beneath me while burning pain spiked up through my left leg. I flopped backwards with a wince which caused even more pain to rip through me. My eyes focused towards my left and there I saw blood beginning to pool around my exposed femur. It stuck straight out of my leg, jagged like a tree ripped from its roots during a storm.

When I looked up, I saw that I had fallen deep into a deep gully finally discovered by me. With the moon and stars staring back down to me as my only companions, I soon was visited by another. The lanky figure stood at the edge of the grounds opening staring down at me. Even with no distinguishable eyes I could feel its stare. It felt as if it was attempting to peel me away from my built up sorrow with just a glare. I forced my eyes shut and welcomed in the ever creeping darkness of the forest.

In this darkness, I thought of you. I attempted to replace my unearthly pain with the familiar warm euphoria I shared with you but even in my memories you remained distance. My frail body ached in mind splitting agony and I began to grow very cold. My life sat frozen at the bottom of this gully and all I could muster was a dry weep. Tears slowly slipped from under my eyes and I chocked back the pain of my unforgiving reality. When I opened my eyes, the ghost of the forest made their way to me.

Along the edge of the forest stood rows of black figures outlined in the soft moonlight. To my horror, the lanky tall figure that led me here. It seemed to be made of a black smoke with thin arms that came to a dull point. It’s head bent down to look at me and I shivered out a response, “W-what the hell are you?”

The figure cocked its smoky head to one side then raised one of its arms towards me. I begged silently for it to go away but my prayers were left unanswered as it pressed the end into my chest. All at once my pain began to fade and warmth spread into me. I finally breathed out a sigh of relief and felt snow land against my face. The figures were gone and I remained in the dimly lite snow. Starting in my chest I began to hear a light hum come from all around me. It soon became deafening when a white light replaced my familiar night sky. No matter the meaning behind it, I remained calm. 

For a moment I was finally at my long forgotten peace. A smile crept along my face and to my amazement; I was able to make out something from the light. A singular, lone snowflake flew towards me before I closed my eyes. The patter was all too familiar to me as it gentle fell. There ahead of me was a stellar dendrite. Almost the same one you had tattooed on your back.

I woke up today and I was headed to work. After having my coffee.. I was headed to work. I can't find my keys. I usually  put them on the counter. It's their place.
 I started to stress out as I know that I am locked inside my house and I know I might not be able to make it to work. I tried to call my husband and I remembered that we had a conflict last night I ended up sleeping in the guest's room. The thing is he had drink a few and was kinda mean to me. So I told him that I didn't want and anrgument with him.

 Anyhow.. I started to panick. I also had an anxiety attack. I called my nighbors who was able to unlock me within 2 hours which was great. I am a teacher. My students were excited for today's activity it broke my heart. I had to call the school so they could cancel my classes and reschedule them for another day.

The situation made me feel very frunstrated and I was literally shivering. I couldn't believe that he could be so immature to do such a move. I was asking all the questions. I have seen lots of videos of women talking about how men keeps sqbotaging them and making their lives miserable. 

I never thought my partner who I thought I chose well would have done this to me. 
I ended up  being able to make it to the last two hours with a different class and was able to manage the absence as I explained. But I was really discusted and nervous. I wasn't able to eat and I made a mistake on the board. 

Anyhow. I think I was still brave after going after what I felt because I was so sad and angry. I kept listening to music to motivate myself. 

5 pm he calls to say he is at home and he doesnt have the keys. I asked him to give me my keys first. He was like.. what. Compmete denial he didn't take them. He doesn't know. It's me who lost my keys and tries to blame his wonderful soul. Even myself started to believe it. I repeat again, give them to me because I never changed their spot. I am sure that you took them. He said ok dear calm down. We'll get inside and search. I say okay I oped the outside door. He enters. Blames me for trying to incriminate him. 

I say so where are my keys and he points at the end of tje counter and I say but those are not my keys. He says ok lool closer maybe it's in the corner. I get closer and they are just under some package. You can't really see it if you don't remove the thing. So I was in chock.. yet I was trying to understand.. I ask did you put my keys in here. He bullshits me to try and make me believe it was me.I straight looked to him and told him that he is a liar. he then pauses and says ok I think it was me who put them there but trust me it was not voluntarily. I didnt mean to hide them. I mistook them for my keys and put them mistakingly there on my way out. I thought to myself that this is also bullshit. 

So I went back to the guests room and I think thats where I'd be for the next couple of days. I took my shower and went out with a few collegues and now I am home. 

I try not to think about it.. but I can't believe that he took me for an idiot. I also now think that this isn't the first time he might be gaslighting me. 

I am sharing this to make sure I am not crazy.
I would appreciate your help.

In Alaska so nowhere to go. feel so stuck.,"I have been with my partner/boyfriend for 6 years.  I am 23 and he is 26. Around 1 year into our relationship he cheated on me with his ex girlfriend, one of my friends, an older woman (30s), and one of his “friends” in another city. 

I forgave him and we stayed together but it hurt me deeply. I quickly became kinda obsessed with these women and stated stalking the on social media, google, etc. Whatever information I could find. 

I compare myself to them constantly. I need to be thinner, more active, look better, etc. Unfortunately these women he cheated on me with are very beautiful and attractive, and I am not. I have a weird face and a big nose which makes me a lower value compared to other girls. I would consider myself a “butterface” if you understand. 

I originally forgave him because he cheated on me during a manic episode, on a bender. He quit drinking for years and years and genuinely changed as a person and we began to build a life together. 

3 years pass and I trusted him again. But one day I checked his phone… for no reason other than that I was insecure and needed to lurk and I noticed he readded one of the girls he cheated on me with, Sierra. (woman in her 30s). I confronted him about this and he was upset I looked through his phone. Long story short he had a good and valid excuse (don’t feel like explaining it just bear with me here)

Months later I get an icky feeling again. He was out of the house so I check his laptop. He’s subscribed to only fans. He has reddit comments trying to get a specific OF influencers content for free. We fight. He apologized. I get over it. 

years pass 

this year, night of halloween. We have a blast with our friends. We go home. everything is good, but i’m too drunk for sex. Next morning i make coffee and we wake up slow after drinking the night before. 

He is freaking out looking for his phone, can’t find it. 
I go to the bathroom, i saw he left his phone in the bathroom.  I close and lock the door and he starts FREAKING out that he can’t find his phone, 

i check and bam. 

Messages to Sierra. 

okay. We fight, but this time I can’t forgive him. I cry, break shit, crash out. He says he’s so sorry. Eventually everything calms down and i’m still with him weeks later?

We’ve have sex like 3-4 times since but the last two weeks i have been refusing to. He’s moved into the spare bedroom completely now (thankfully) 

We’ve fought a lot, he’s even been treating me poorly. Eventually i got it out of him that he liked Sierra because she let him do whatever he wants during sex and he doesn’t respect her. 

WHY HAVENT I LEFT?

Good question, I am in Alaska. From Alaska. My family lives in the Lower 48 now. I have no family, no support system, i’m in college, and I work a seasonal job with the state. 

Lease (1,500 a month) isn’t up until Feb. I have no truck, family, or friends to help me move out. Rental market is insane and I can’t afford to live on my own, campus housing is even more expensive. Also it’s impossible to find a place to rent in Alaska in general, let alone in the middle of winter. 

things are okay when we smoke weed and play video games together. Hes never done anything to hurt me(other than cheat lol), he doesn’t yell at me, hit, or threaten me in way way. But every day I look in the mirror and i start punching myself in the thighs, head, chest, arms, and i have bruises. I starting intensely working out to lose weight. 

will i be enough ever for him? why does he keep cheating and why do i keep forgiving him? wtf js wrong with me. Am i stuck like this for the rest of my life????

1pdenhg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AdultADHDSupportGroup/comments/1pdenhg/time_blindness_and_executive_function_resource/,time blindness and executive function resource help,"Hi I (37F) been struggling all my life with executive function issues (*like us all, duh*) but I was wondering what are the **BEST** resources for working on helping to fix time blindness and just getting things I want to get done **AND** things I ***need*** to get done (laundry , cleaning etc)? What has helped you?  

**some background**: I struggle a lot to take care of myself - my diet, exercise, sleep routine and my hygiene is super inconsistent. I feel like its gotten worse as I have gotten older. Sometimes i get on kicks that last a little while but then i fall entirely off the wagon. I'm an artist and i have a full time job. Most times im just scrambling to work late, after staying up super late for my revenge procrastination and then working all day in a daze (adderall gets me through the day, but after 3pm i start to steadily slump badly) then i go home and crash and doom scroll or online shop (bad cope for me )  Sometimes i eat sugar during the day. Sometimes i drink a lot of coffee, its the only thing that can help after 5pm especially. The thing is that I don't have an issue falling asleep  but I find myself avoiding it and refusing to let go.   
  
If i get on a routine that works and is supportive - if someone has a bday, or an event or whatever that comes up unexpectedly (or if i have to go to an art opening / make new art for something) and I am required to go, it just makes everything fall out the window. Part of this is my people pleasing tendency and part of it is never having a routine my whole life. being able to say no is not easy for me. I also see going to these things as an escape about what i need to do. 

the thing is now i'm avoiding things I **WANT** to get done. Like my art. I avoid using my studio and focusing on projects outside of my day job.  I am excited and have many ideas but i actively avoid it because of the time and effort and physical push ( i also have chronic pain so fear pushing myself too hard) When i do take the time, I really miscalculate how long it takes me to finish things and either rush it or I spend hours i don't have to do things. I often think about taking lessons or something so that i am forced into a routine outside of work..idk. I also get hyper focused on my spending and stressed but then just spend it all if i get overwhelmed. Or needing the ""perfect setup to get started"" which requires shopping which is a lazier dopamine hit. 

Obviously i want to be healthier and make my art. That's pretty much the bottom line. I'm tired of living in chaos mode as a zombie. 

**ALL THAT SAID:**  
 **does anyone have any recommendations dealing with executive function?**  
 **podcasts, workbooks, audiobooks, videos, apps , (whatever it is!!)...that are your absolute favorite that can help? Obviously the less expensive the better ( free even better)**

 I started to stress out as I know that I am locked inside my house and I know I might not be able to make it to work. I tried to call my husband and I remembered that we had a conflict last night I ended up sleeping in the guest's room. The thing is he had drink a few and was kinda mean to me. So I told him that I didn't want and anrgument with him.

 Anyhow.. I started to panick. I also had an anxiety attack. I called my nighbors who was able to unlock me within 2 hours which was great. I am a teacher. My students were excited for today's activity it broke my heart. I had to call the school so they could cancel my classes and reschedule them for another day.

The situation made me feel very frunstrated and I was literally shivering. I couldn't believe that he could be so immature to do such a move. I was asking all the questions. I have seen lots of videos of women talking about how men keeps sqbotaging them and making their lives miserable. 

I never thought my partner who I thought I chose well would have done this to me. 
I ended up  being able to make it to the last two hours with a different class and was able to manage the absence as I explained. But I was really discusted and nervous. I wasn't able to eat and I made a mistake on the board. 

Anyhow. I think I was still brave after going after what I felt because I was so sad and angry. I kept listening to music to motivate myself. 

5 pm he calls to say he is at home and he doesnt have the keys. I asked him to give me my keys first. He was like.. what. Compmete denial he didn't take them. He doesn't know. It's me who lost my keys and tries to blame his wonderful soul. Even myself started to believe it. I repeat again, give them to me because I never changed their spot. I am sure that you took them. He said ok dear calm down. We'll get inside and search. I say okay I oped the outside door. He enters. Blames me for trying to incriminate him. 

I say so where are my keys and he points at the end of tje counter and I say but those are not my keys. He says ok lool closer maybe it's in the corner. I get closer and they are just under some package. You can't really see it if you don't remove the thing. So I was in chock.. yet I was trying to understand.. I ask did you put my keys in here. He bullshits me to try and make me believe it was me.I straight looked to him and told him that he is a liar. he then pauses and says ok I think it was me who put them there but trust me it was not voluntarily. I didnt mean to hide them. I mistook them for my keys and put them mistakingly there on my way out. I thought to myself that this is also bullshit. 

So I went back to the guests room and I think thats where I'd be for the next couple of days. I took my shower and went out with a few collegues and now I am home. 

I try not to think about it.. but I can't believe that he took me for an idiot. I also now think that this isn't the first time he might be gaslighting me. 

I am sharing this to make sure I am not crazy.
I would appreciate your help. 

Idk what to do tbh. How can I deal with this behaviour?

My post accidently got through in my trauma center this morning, they removed it. They are vibe heavy in there. Its mostly memes and light posting, which is not where I am coming from at all.  It's not a container built for depth. 

🎶 Spiral by Ed Sheeran

I realized last night that continuing to post there was going  to breach my protectors threshold of tolerance. I wanted to make sure they knew not to contact me directly if they chose not to let it through via my protector activation state atm. But they forgot to turn off the automod. feature. They didnt directly say it to me, so it at least didnt hit as hard as it might have. 

I will be talking to my therapist about whether she thinks I should leave completely again to protect my mental health.

I intentionally skipped the coffee with the trauma center live today with them. Knowing I might not be able to control my protectors. I visited later watched the video. I love the OT.

It's not that it post anything bad, or highly triggering it's the removal of voice, control and dominance that I am getting from another system in there. A lack of attunement.

 I was being honest that my system is struggling to stay connected, as I process heal and grow. I wanted to let them know that. The strand of hair that my system is/was holding onto to stay connected to the trauma center.

I dont know how long I will be allowed to remain here either. So I am trying to make a lot of connections to support my DID healing processing everywhere.

I imagine that many others have to deal with triggering, trauma échos and the fight to be their true selves in a world that makes you fight for every ounce of authenticity you have inside yourself.",1,1764791759.0,OlderDID,2,1.0,False

1pdem2z,https://www.reddit.com/r/pay2win/comments/1pdem2z/patch_0156_hotfix_changelist/,Patch 0.15.6 Hotfix Changelist,"Hello bosses! There’s a new update available on Steam. We’re focused right now on stability and bugs, so most of these changes will not affect the actual gameplay - but we have gotten your first round of feedback on the current state of the game and we have some great ideas to improve things. Some of the upcoming changes (not in this patch, but future versions) will address many of the core issues. Here’s a shortlist of what we’re looking at:

* Slowing down progression so the game is less chaotic
* More information and visibility to players for better understanding of output
* A completely reworked output calculation formula to standardize facilities and effects
* Audio rework
* Full balance pass for all facilities
* Complete revamp to the Forge and upgrading experience
* Further polish and improvement of the Planetarium
* Rework to the spell system to make casting more accessible

And much much more! If you have feedback, do let us know - we check everywhere, including Discord, Reddit, and the Steam Forums.

# Balance Changes

**Motivational Poster**

* Buff no longer stacks
* Buff reduced to 20% output

**Supercharged**

* Now capped to 1 max stack

**Metronome**

* Reduced rank scaling expeditiously

**Slot Machine**

* Removed from item pool, and is now only accessible via the story

**Briefcase**

* Removed from item pool, and is now only accessible via the story

**Poker Set**

* Max rank increased to 5

**Psychologist**

* Max rank reduced to 3

**Coffee Machine**

* Influence pattern changed from cross to single. *NOTE - Coffee Machine is now very similar to Subwoofers. We will be adding a new pattern in the future to make the Coffee Machine more differentiated, but 4 separate multifires was a bit overkill.*

**Pool Table**

* Rank scaling reduced to 3

**Briefcase**

* Cooldown increased to 8 from 4

# General

**Level Experience**

* Added level data from levels 100 to 1000. Level progression is now based on several different curves, and the max credits top out at 1 Vigintillion. We haven’t actually reached this ourselves yet, and we think the current variable setup *probably* can’t handle it, but we added this for now in case players want to keep their game open beyond Level 100.

# Idle Buff

* Unlock is possible even if the player selects Annie’s decision early game

# Bugfixes

* Fixed issue with menu sometimes hiding itself
* Fixed issue with Hunter Coin Hunter mission not being completable
* Fixed soft lock with progression causing players to no longer receive calls. This issue may still persist, let us know if you encounter it!
* Fixed issue with Magic Caster mission
* Fixed planetarium initialization issue when loading a save
* Fixed issue with Build Mode talent
* Resolved auto advance skipping choices in the story
* Fixed issue with coins not spawning during player onboarding
* Fixed issue with any credit gains granting instant levels
* Fixed issue with Pool Table crashing
* Fixed issue with haste stacking on itself
* Fixed crash with Swiss Army Knife and Fancy Couch
* Fixed crash with Watch Collection interaction
* Fixed text display issue with Subwoofer
* Fixed save data not fully resetting on wipe
* Fixed issue with scratch ticket counter not displaying proper chances

# Visual

* Personal Chef now has a visual cue when he activates.
* Updated Level Up animation for clarity
* Improved feedback speed on menu UX

# Known Issues

Too many to list! We will be continually releasing hotfixes and patches as we stabilize the game further and make the experience more enjoyable.",2,1764791711.0,pay2win,0,1.0,False

I filed all the paperwork and now I have my small business registered with the state and everything. I would like to take on my first clients and try to grow from there! 

As someone who ran a business back in Pakistan, I can understand the struggles of managing it, employees, supplies, and much more. Most small businesses do not have the money to hire an independent agent like big corporations do to let them run on autopilot. I am looking to change that and bring a personal expeirence to the table. 

I previously managed Huawei, Nokia, and other major brands social media in Pakistan when they hired us for a specific campaign and we would have control over their socials for a period of time. We successfully helped launch smartphones, tablets, home products and more with amazing results. 

What makes me stand out is that I am a sole enterprise. There is no middle man you will talk to, it will be me everytime who will meet with you, implement your ideas and more into the posts, and give you detailed feedback on the performance for the week. 

Here is everything I offer: 

\* Curated social media posts that will be shared with you prior to publishing, and eventually when you feel satisfied with my work, I can just make the posts on my own and let you know when they're published. This will cover captions, image, video, publishing, and everything along the way. 

\* Face to face meetings according to your schedule - I am offering my services in person with face to face meetings to help curate your posts, discuss promotions that you would like to run, who your audience is etc. First time customers get a coffee on me if you are okay with meeting at a Capital One Cafe. 

\* Sharing weekly reports of performance with mutual feedback and bilateral ideas on how to improve it. I am familiar with all forms of content and am willing to try a variety of methods to help grow your brand. 

\* I will do a week of posts for you for free. If you would like to publish them or not, that is up to you, but I want to show you that I take your work seriously. 

\* I can do everything from reviving your social media from dormancy to forming a brand new social media for you on the platforms of your choice. 

\* I can help record content for you as well, or you are free to record it and send it as well. Depending on your preference. 

\* I do not use AI at all in my method. I use a combination of photoshop and other apps to do my work, but no AI will be used as I do not agree with it being used in this field. 

I live in Brooklyn and can commute whereever you live. If you are interested, you can drop me a message about your business, and for our first meeting I can make a mockup of what your first posts would look like at our first meeting. ",1,1764791411.0,NYCjobs,0,1.0,False

I’m trying to find an old **folk-rock** song I heard on **Vermont college radio** (likely WRUV at UVM) around **1990**. It may have been by a **local or regional band**, possibly unsigned or independent. Think it might have been called *What she said*?

**Lyrics I remember (approximate):**

**Opening line:**

*“I woke up this morning and the sun burnt holes in my eyes…”*  
(or very close to that)

**Later in the song:**

*“The coffee’s in the kitchen and it’s growing cold,*  
*the girl has many decisions and I’m on my own.”*  
(phrasing might be slightly off — it’s been decades)

**Other details:**

* Genre: **Folk-rock**, maybe a little acoustic, male singer (I think).
* Heard in **Vermont**, on **college radio**, circa **1989–1991**.
* Not a mainstream or charting song — might have been a local band, demo, or something only DJs had on tape.
* Mood was reflective, maybe slightly melancholic.

**What it is NOT:**

* Not *Woke Up This Morning* by Alabama 3.
* Not a known commercial hit from that era.

If anyone recognizes these lyrics, the band, or the VT college-radio scene and its local musicians around 1990, I’d really appreciate the help.  
Even guesses or leads toward indie bands of that time would be great.

For as long as I remember, even during school, I've had huge problems with procastination and concentration. This would start in school, where I was never actually able to do any work in class. Instead, I would zone out, wait around for eight hours, go home, and then do everything on my own terms. More often than not, I needed the stress of an upcoming exam on the next day to actually do ANYTHING at all. However, as soon as I had that deadline, I was able to consume copious amounts of coffee and pull an all-nighter and get good grades by pure determination. I could never properly listen to my teachers, and would instead rely on learning the material through books. As soon as a teacher started talking, my brain would shut off and start thinking about my favorite videogames instead. 

Now I am in university, and the issue has still not resolved itself. It's a bit better, because lectures aren't mandatory. I just don't bother going. The one time I tried, someone asked me if I was cold because I was fidgeting excessively in an effort to keep my mind from wandering. That's another problem, I'm fidgety as fuck. I constantly have to chew something, bounce my leg, tap with my fingers etc. Infact, the chewing is the worst part because it's so damn disgusting. I tear apart plastic caps from water bottles with my teeth because nothing else calms me down like that does. I also used to chew apart my folders when I was still in school. 

Now, when I study at home, I also struggle. I need that deadline, once again. If I have it, I am extremely good at taking in chunks of information, and I will usually achieve good results, but I'm fucked with subjects that need long-term studying. Whenever I sit down a week before an exam, I can't do it. Even if I shut out all distractions, my mind will wander. It's like my brain is trying to force itself away from the subject matter. I will be sitting in a cleaned, quiet room with my phone shut off and only my textbook, and my brain will start thinking about Batman or the weather or birds.  
I have found a few ways to get atleast some amount of study in, and they work, but it's terrible and stressful. I will list them as follows.

A) Studying while taking hour long walks. If my legs are occupied and I walk around the block, coupled with the outside background noise, I can concentrate somewhat. This also goes for train rides. 

B) Setting deadlines by busying up my day. I decide to go to choir that evening so I have to study. However, sometimes this backfires and I get stuck in a ""paralysis"" where I don't do ANYTHING at all. And then I have a nervous breakdown. I don't know why it works sometimes and doesn't other times.

C) Chewing gum excessively, so much that I get crippling jaw pain, and drinking insane amounts of caffeine. Or just eating while studying in general (so much so, that I have gained weight from it). Having something to do ""orally"" helps with concentration. The amount of caffeine is absurd, I drink three cups of coffee in the morning and 1-2 monster energy throughout the day. 

D) Doing chores while studying. Somehow the background activity quiets my brain, but it also makes for slow progress, but I guess it is better that none. 

E) Listening to extremely fast-paced music. I usually listen to eminem while studying and it's the only thing that can shut up my brain when I am sitting at my desk. I also have unironically listened to the fnaf meme song jackie's box on repeat for hours because somehow it helped me so much studying.

F) Taking Ritaline. Sometimes it makes me incredibly tired too, but sometimes it helps, and it actually makes my brain shut up. However, I really don't want to be the type of person that abuses drugs for university, and it makes me feel like a loser.

Mind you am I still semi-succesful and managing med school okayish, but I feel incredibly stupid.

I’m looking to form a small friends group/ Sapphic bookclub. LMK if interested and I can get a group text chat going but these are the vibes I’m hoping to cultivate:

~ Group size possibly 5 to 6 folks. All ages welcome! 

~ Monthly or bi weekly Meetings via brunch, coffee/tea room or wine night (depending on everyone’s schedules) discussing and reflecting on the book. 

~ Also a safe space where we can totally share our own dating chaos/current and past romances, what we learned from them and want in our next one, any dating or sex advice, bad first date stories, etc. 

~ Genre solely lesbian romance, please<3 

~ Rotating host to lead in person gatherings but I don’t mind taking the initiative for now :)


LMK if still interested<3 and I will make a group text chat where we can share intros, book(s) we want to read and do a tally or wheel spin on which one to start reading first!!

I’m a travel planner, I use (searchspot.ai)and I recently planned a 5-day solo Bali adventure for a 27-year-old client (mid-range budget, Dec 25–29, 2025). He’s not into partying much – the focus is pure adventure: volcano trekking, rafting, a bit of surfing, and some nature/culture, all while keeping things practical for rainy season. Thought I’d share the itinerary to get feedback and help others planning something similar.​

**Client profile & basics:**

* Age & style: 27, solo, wants “active adventure” over nightlife or beach clubs.
* Time: 5 days over Christmas week.
* Budget: Mid-range.
* Base: I kept him fully in **Ubud** to avoid wasting time in traffic and to be close to inland adventures like Mt. Batur and Ayung River.​

# Why Ubud (Not Canggu) for This Trip

I compared **Ubud vs Canggu** for him:

* Ubud is closer to volcano trekking, rafting, rice terraces, waterfalls, and cultural spots.
* Canggu wins for surfing, beach clubs, and a heavy social/party scene.

Since his priority is in-land adventure (hikes, rafting, jungle vibes) and not nightlife, Ubud made more sense as a single base for 5 days.​

# The Itinerary I Built (Dec 25–29, Ubud Base)

**Day 1 – Dec 25: Arrival → Ubud**

* Land at DPS, Visa on Arrival, then private transfer straight to Ubud.
* Check into a mid-range, solo-friendly place with a pool.
* Evening: Light walk around central Ubud, dinner, early night before the volcano trek.
* **Day 2 – Dec 26: Mt. Batur Sunrise Trek**
* \~2:00–2:30 AM: Pickup from hotel in Ubud.
* Sunrise hike up Mt. Batur in a small group with guide, breakfast at/after the summit, then return late morning.
* Afternoon: Rest, pool, massage.
* Evening: Casual dinner in town.​

**Day 3 – Dec 27: Ayung River White-Water Rafting**

* Late morning pickup for a half-day Ayung River rafting trip (class II–III, good for beginners).
* Includes gear, guide, and lunch, then back to Ubud by mid/late afternoon.
* Evening free for cafes, another massage, or just relaxing.​

**Day 4 – Dec 28: Flex Day – Ubud Highlights or Surf Trip**  
Option A (inland focus):

* Ubud area loop: Tegalalang Rice Terrace, a coffee plantation, 1–2 waterfalls (e.g., Tibumana / Kanto Lampo), and a temple stop if time/energy allow.

Option B (if he really wants waves):

* Day trip to Canggu for a beginner surf lesson with a surf school, then back to Ubud in the evening (using Grab/Gojek or private driver).

**Day 5 – Dec 29: Chill & Departure**

* Slow morning with breakfast, short walk or market stop, maybe a quick swim.
* Transfer to the airport with a generous buffer for holiday traffic and rain.

# Operators & Stays I Shortlisted

**For tours:**

* Mt. Batur: Small-group sunrise tours from Ubud with hotel pickup, local guide, gear, and simple breakfast included.​
* Ayung Rafting: Reputable operators that provide hotel pickup, safety briefings, gear, and buffet lunch.​
* Surf (optional): Beginner-friendly surf school in Canggu with small group sizes, if he chooses Option B on Day 4.​

**For accommodation (Ubud, mid-range, solo-friendly):**

* **Puri Garden Hotel & Hostel** – Social, pool, yoga, easy for a solo traveler to meet people.​
* **Kuna Bali** – Aesthetic boutique-hostel vibe, social but not crazy.​
* Plus a quieter guesthouse option if he decides he’d rather rest than socialize every night.​

I’d love input from people who know Bali well:

* Would you tweak this for a 27-year-old solo traveler in late December (rainy season)?
* Is the balance between “big adventure days” and rest about right?
* For a first-timer, would you push more for the surf day from Ubud, or keep Day 4 fully focused on Ubud-area highlights?

Any tips, must-do spots, or operator names you trust are super welcome – helps me refine this and future itineraries for similar clients.",1,1764790513.0,balitrips,0,1.0,False
1pde240,https://www.reddit.com/r/estateplanningbayarea/comments/1pde240/what_happens_to_your_lease_after_a_fire_or/,What Happens to Your Lease After a Fire or Natural Disaster in California?,"Disaster [strikes without warning](https://baylegal.com/real-estate-housing-and-property-law/real-estate-law-faq/). One moment, you are enjoying your morning coffee; the next, you are standing on the sidewalk watching smoke billow from your living room window. The panic of losing personal belongings is overwhelming. However, a second wave of panic often hits days later. The landlord calls. They want to know when you will pay next month’s rent. Most tenants assume a destroyed apartment cancels the lease automatically. This assumption is dangerous. It could ruin your credit and drain your savings.

Understanding tenant rights after disaster scenarios is not just academic; it is a financial survival skill.

The relationship between a landlord and a tenant changes the moment a structure fails. California law provides specific escape hatches for tenants, but landlords do not always advertise these rules. You need to know exactly where you stand.

# The Legal “Eject” Button: California Civil Code 1932

You do not have to live in a burnt shell of a home. California Civil Code 1932 acts as the primary legal shield for tenants facing this nightmare. This statute explicitly states that a hirer (tenant) may terminate a lease if the greater part of the thing [hired perishes](https://baylegal.com/essential-estate-planning-documents-for-california-residents/) from any other cause than the want of ordinary care of the hirer.

In plain English, if the unit is destroyed and it wasn’t your fault, you can walk away.

However, the definition of “destroyed” causes legal battles. A lease after fire in California does not vanish just because the carpet is singed. The damage must be substantial. It must render the unit uninhabitable due to damage. Landlords often argue that a unit is still livable even when walls are scorched or mold is blooming after a flood.

If you invoke California Civil Code 1932 incorrectly, the landlord may accuse you of abandonment. They might sue for the remainder of the lease term. Therefore, Bay Legal PC advises tenants to document every inch of the damage before making a move.

If you are struggling with a lease after a fire in California, do not navigate this crisis alone. Landlords often pressure tenants into paying for uninhabitable spaces. Bay Legal PC helps tenants understand their rights under California Civil Code 1932. Call us at [(650) 668 8000](tel:16506688000) to discuss your property destroyed lease situation immediately. (Disclaimer: Past results do not guarantee future outcomes.)

# When is a Home Truly Uninhabitable?

A [rental unit destroyed](https://baylegal.com/what-happens-without-an-estate-plan-in-california/) by fire is obvious. A roof sitting in the living room is hard to dispute. Yet, habitability is nuanced. Landlord-tenant law natural disaster provisions look at specific criteria. Does the unit have waterproofing? Is the plumbing working? Is there a safe gas connection?

If an earthquake damage apartment scenario leaves cracks in the walls but the structure is sound, you might remain stuck in the lease. Conversely, if the quake severed the water main, the unit is likely uninhabitable.

Tenants must act with caution. You cannot simply stop paying rent without following protocol. Doing so risks an eviction record, which makes finding a new apartment nearly impossible. We assist clients in determining if their specific situation meets the legal threshold for immediate termination.

# The Battle Over Rent Abatement

Perhaps you want to stay. Maybe the housing market is too expensive, and you prefer to wait for repairs. This is where rent abatement comes into play. This legal concept allows you to pay reduced rent based on the percentage of the home you can still use.

If a kitchen fire makes 20% of the house unusable, you should theoretically pay 20% less rent.

Disputes here are common. A landlord might offer a $100 discount for a property destroyed lease situation where half the house is missing. This is rarely fair. Tenant rights after a disaster include the right to a fair reduction in rental costs. If the entire unit is uninhabitable due to damage, you generally should not pay any rent for that period.

Negotiating rent abatement requires a paper trail. You need photos, correspondence, and potentially an inspection report. Bay Legal PC helps tenants present this evidence to landlords to strive for a fair adjustment.

# Lease Termination After Flood and Water Damage

Fire is dramatic, but water is insidious. Lease termination after flood events is complex because the damage often worsens over time. Mold can grow behind drywall days after the water recedes. You might think the unit is safe, only to develop respiratory issues a week later.

In a lease after a fire in California, the damage is usually visible. With floods, the property destroyed, the lease argument relies on health hazards.

If the landlord refuses to remediate [toxic mold](https://baylegal.com/advance-health-care-directive-california-guide/) caused by a flood, the unit becomes legally uninhabitable. You have the right to leave. However, you must give the landlord a reasonable chance to fix it. Leaving too early without notice can backfire.

We advise keeping a timeline of all interactions regarding earthquake damage, apartment repairs, or flood remediation. If the landlord ignores requests, your case for termination strengthens significantly.

Dealing with a rental unit destroyed by disaster is overwhelming. Bay Legal PC advises clients on landlord-tenant law and natural disaster issues, including rent abatement negotiations. Do not let a landlord ignore tenant rights after a disaster. Schedule a consultation directly via our [booking calendar](https://baylegal.com/booking-calendars/) to secure your time. (Disclaimer: Results depend on the unique facts of each case.)

# Who Pays for Your Stuff?

This is a hard truth. Your landlord’s insurance almost never covers your personal belongings. It covers the building. If a rental unit destroyed by fire contains your furniture, clothes, and electronics, the loss falls on you unless you have renter’s insurance.

However, if the uninhabitable due to damage status was caused by the landlord’s negligence—like faulty wiring they ignored—you might have a claim. California Civil Code 1932 allows you to break the lease, but seeking compensation for lost goods is a separate legal battle.

Landlord-tenant law and natural disaster statutes protect your right to housing, not your PlayStation. Bay Legal PC works to identify if negligence played a role in the disaster, which could open avenues for compensation.

# The Security Deposit Trap

After a lease termination due to flood or fire, you want your security deposit back. You need that money for a new place. Landlords sometimes withhold this money. They might claim you caused the fire. They might claim the earthquake damage apartment issues were actually pre-existing holes you punched in the wall.

Under California Civil Code 1932, if the lease ends due to destruction, the landlord must account for the deposit within 21 days. They cannot deduct for damage caused by the disaster.

If a landlord tries to charge you for a property destroyed lease repair, they are likely violating the law. Fighting for this money is often necessary. We help tenants draft demand letters to recover these critical funds.

# Constructive Eviction: Forcing the Issue

Sometimes, a landlord refuses to fix a rental unit destroyed by a disaster but also refuses to let you out of the lease. They want the rent check. This creates a “[constructive eviction](https://baylegal.com/california-wills-trusts-which-is-right-2025-comparison/).”

This means conditions are so bad that you are effectively forced out. Tenant rights after disaster support this defense. If you move out because the heat hasn’t worked for a month after a storm, you are not abandoning the lease; you are being evicted by the condition of the property.

Using this defense for a lease after a fire in California requires precise legal maneuvering. You must prove notice was given and ignored.

# Steps to Protect Yourself Immediately

1. Document Everything: Take photos of the earthquake-damaged apartment or fire scene immediately.
2. Send Written Notice: Inform the landlord formally that the unit is uninhabitable due to damage.
3. Check Your Policy: See if your renter’s insurance covers temporary housing.
4. Do Not Auto-Pay: Ensure you do not accidentally pay full rent for a property destroyed lease.
5. Seek Counsel: Landlord-tenant law and natural disaster complexities are vast.

Confusion benefits the landlord. Clarity benefits the tenant. Rent abatement calculations and lease termination after flood protocols are not things you should guess at. One wrong move can result in a lawsuit for unpaid rent on a home that no longer exists.

# The Danger of “Standard” Lease Clauses

Many standard leases contain clauses that try to override California Civil Code 1932. They might say the tenant waives their right to terminate after a disaster.

These waivers are often unenforceable. California courts generally protect tenants from signing away basic habitability rights. However, a landlord will still wave that contract in your face. They will demand payment based on a void clause.

Recognizing an illegal clause in a California lease agreement after a fire is difficult for the untrained eye. Bay Legal PC reviews lease agreements to identify provisions that violate state law.

# Moving Forward

The aftermath of a disaster is chaotic. You are rebuilding your life. The last thing you need is a legal anchor dragging you down. Whether you are dealing with a rental unit destroyed by wildfire or an earthquake-damaged apartment, your rights remain intact.

Tenant rights after a disaster are powerful, but they are not automatic. You must assert them. You must follow the procedure. You must [protect your financial future](https://baylegal.com/estate-planning/california-trust-attorney/) from the ashes of your former home.

The law provides a path out. But the clock is ticking, and your landlord is likely already consulting their own legal team.

# Frequently Asked Questions

# 1. Can I break my lease after California destroys my unit?

Yes, under California Civil Code 1932, you generally have the right to terminate the agreement if the rental unit destroyed is no longer habitable through no fault of your own. You must provide proper notice to the landlord immediately.

# 2. Do I owe rent if my property-destroying lease is active?

If the home is totally uninhabitable due to damage, you typically do not owe rent for the time you cannot live there. However, for partial damage, you may only be entitled to rent abatement rather than a full stoppage.

# 3. What defines a unit as uninhabitable due to damage?

A unit is uninhabitable due to damage if it lacks essentials like waterproofing, plumbing, heat, or safe electrical systems. Landlord-tenant law natural disaster guidelines specify that health and safety risks render a property unfit for human occupancy.

# 4. How does rent abatement work for partial damage?

Rent abatement reduces your monthly payment proportionally to the damage. If an earthquake-damaged apartment loses 30% of its usable space, you might negotiate a 30% rent reduction. Legal advice helps determine the fair percentage for your specific situation.

# 5. Does landlord-tenant law cover my belongings?

Generally, no. Landlord-tenant law natural disaster rules cover the structure, not personal property. Unless the landlord was negligent and caused the fire or flood, you usually must rely on your own renter’s insurance policy to replace your personal items.

# 6. Can a landlord evict me after a lease termination following a flood

If the unit is destroyed, the tenancy effectively ends. However, a landlord cannot “evict” you in retaliation for exercising tenant rights after a disaster. They can end the lease if repairs require the unit to be vacant for safety reasons.

# 7. What if my landlord ignores earthquake damage apartment repairs?

If a landlord ignores critical repairs, you may have the right to withhold rent or repair and deduct costs. California Civil Code 1932 may also allow you to vacate if the earthquake-damaged apartment remains unsafe for living.

# 8. How do I prove the rental unit destroyed was not my fault?

Fire department reports and insurance inspections are crucial. To use the lease after fire California termination rights, the damage cannot be from your negligence. Bay Legal PC advises keeping all official reports to prove the cause was external.

# 9. Does California Civil Code 1932 apply to all disasters?

California Civil Code 1932 applies broadly when the “thing hired perishes.” This covers a property destroyed lease via fire, flood, or storm. It provides a legal basis for termination when the property effectively ceases to exist as a residence.

# 10. What are the key tenant rights after a disaster strikes?

Key tenant rights after a disaster include the right to a habitable home, the right to rent abatement for unusable space, and the right to terminate the lease if the unit is destroyed. You also have the right to your security deposit.

# 🌴 What Is This Group?

We exist to bridge the gap between online chatting and real-life friendships. We started as a small Reddit thread and grew so quickly that we evolved into a full local community network.

* Coffee & brewery hangouts
* Beach days & bonfires
* Hikes & outdoor activities
* Book clubs & craft nights

I have received a new moka pot as a gift maybe 1 month ago. It has been working well but I have noticed there were strange scratches inside the upper chamber made of aluminium.

Do you know if there are any health risks to continue to use this moka pot because of the scratches?

The only thing that could have done that, in my opinion, is a stainless steel spoon that I use to mix the coffee before pouring it.

I'm afraid that the aluminium coating may be damaged and that toxic substances may be leaching into the coffee especially given the high temperatures.

1pddx8k,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1pddx8k/ghosted_by_a_stripper/,Ghosted by a stripper,"Before anyone reads this i just want to clarify that yes I am attracted to strippers. Fortunately for whatever reasons ive been able to date a lot of them. Last time i counted at one particular place I was at 14 girls averaging 1 a month for a little over a year. I am not in the habit of giving money to any of them therefore I shouldn't be stereotyped as someone who was being used for money or anything tangible. 

I met a girl about a year and a half ago at a place I used to play pool at. We started dating on and off. The reason it was on and off was because when she did something I didnt tolerate I would pull away. My theory is you teach people how to treat you based on what you allow. When we weren't on speaking terms I would hear from her co workers that she was telling them that her and I were talking. I always found that odd as if she didn't want anyone else to potentially date me and hit it off. Other times when I was speaking to a Co worker of hers I later found out that she had asked her Co worker if I said or asked anything about her. 

I dont know but things like that always made me feel like she was into me to some degree.

Fast forward to this year about 3 months ago we run into each other at another place. I hadn't seen her in about 4-5 months. We hit it off and hung out that night. The next morning she texts me then we started ""talking"" again. 

We had planned to take a trip to costa rica in December to go to a concert. Every week we met up however she had a bad habit of asking me to hang out then supposedly forgetting. I ended up telling her not to ever do that to me again or else im going to end up cutting her off. I admitted I liked her but was concerned that I was going to pay for this vacation and feel theres a chance she doesnt show or ""forgets"". After I admitted I liked her she started to open up more. It seemed as if she was very responsive to knowing that. The next time we saw each other she starting speaking in terms of us dating now and mentioned that she wanted her Co workers to know that I would go to see her and even got jealous when another Co worker of hers I used to talk to came up to talk to me. 

It wasnt a big deal. Her emotions I could handle. I had told her though to draw lines and not to cross them. Be mad but dont call me out of my name, be crazy but dont assume something and act on it without talking to me first etc.

The last time we saw each other we got to the point where we started being affectionate. Her  sitting on me, laying on my chest, holding hands, kissing, she even paid for the date. That night she had asked me what I was doing for Thanksgiving and if I wanted to be her plus 1 to go meet all of her friends. I told her sure. Then she asked me if I wanted to come over to her place the following morning to watch a movie and to make me coffee. I said okay. We obviously were taking things further. She even insisted that I start picking her up on dates from now on. 

The next day came and she never sent me her address. She sent me a couple texts here and there however when I texted about her coming over to my place she never responded. I then called just to try and confirm and she never picked up. I haven't heard from her since. Im not sure what happen. I think maybe she got back with her ex or maybe realized she wasnt ready for a relationship. I dont know. I wonder if thats the case then why invite me to the holidays and to her place if she didnt actually have intentions for me to actually go or wasn't relationship ready?

Its not as if she was leading me on to use me for money or gifts because thats something I never gave. I actually thought I was playing this one correct and that she liked me for me. I was going with her flow. I wasnt pressuring her to take any of these steps however all I can do at this point is accept that it wasnt what I thought and keep it pushing. 

Anyone who read my story thanks for your time.",0,1764790163.0,dating_advice,8,0.33,False

1pddwhv,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChildhoodTrauma/comments/1pddwhv/story_3_the_teen_years/,Story #3 - the Teen Years,"It’s been a while since I posted, but I’m sure the gap will turn into stories at some point or another too. 

So being a teenager was obviously difficult for many people, not just me, and many of us did stupid things. Just remember that as you read on lol. 

When I got into grade 8 John moved back home for a bit. I had suppressed the memories of his abuse by this point and he began taking me along for many of his escapades. He would call the school to excuse me for the day (he was 22 at this point and I was 13). Then we would steal one of the cars on our property (he didn’t have a drivers license), he would drive us over to his girlfriends house for the day where we would smoke weed all day, and then go home before our parents would find out. One of those day trips turned into us eating magic mushrooms, and I was in air cadets and had a parade to attend that evening so that was a terrible idea but somehow I made it through! Eventually SD realized his second vehicle seemed to be “losing” gas so he started to write down the odometer readings and that’s how he caught us stealing the car. He beat John up and kicked him out for it. 

Once grade 9 hit I started living part time with my dad and step mom (SM) for the first time in my life. I got my first job at a popular coffee franchise in my country, and I worked every weekend. The first 2 months of grade 9, Ace and I were drinking every weekend behind our parents back. Dad was a cabbie so every Friday and Saturday he worked 8pm-5am, and SM was gone to visit family in the states. 

One of my first times being at dad’s house with SM since being in high school I remember she sent Ace and Bob out at 11pm to go get her c*caine. They were 14 and almost 15 at the time. Bob was also working, and dad and SM were now making Bob and I pay rent to continue living with them. So this rent payment became $200/mo each, plus whatever drugs or alcohol we could get SM. We also were not allowed to eat any of the food in the house unless SM specifically made some for specific people. If we made a can of soup from the pantry we would get screamed at and made to replace it. If we were to buy ourselves something and not make enough for dad and SM we would get screamed at and kicked out of the house. So we often resorted to buying a bag of chips from the convenient store and that would be our dinner (my parents didn’t have teeth so chips were something they didn’t eat). 

Come Halloween of that year, Ace and I decided we wanted to try ecst*sy. So October 30th I skipped school, went with Ace’s gf to another high school to pick up our pills, and then she told me to just take one, so I did. Then my dad called me. He knew I was skipping and I needed to get back to school immediately or I was gonna be in huge trouble. I got back to school, but I was wearing blue jeans, which were not accepted at my school so they sent me home and my dad had to come get me. I was SCARED! I could feel some effects of the pill kicking in, raised heart rate, jittery feeling, vision seeming brighter and clearer. 

So my dad picks me up, scolding me for clearly having no intentions of going to school that day, and when we get home he tells me to sit in the living room while he figured out what to do with me and he goes upstairs with SM. So now I’m sitting in the living room alone, texting all my friends and my brother freaking out, TRYING not to get caught being on drugs. My dad calls me upstairs, so I stand up, and suddenly I hit the peak of the high - everything is shaking, my vision is like strobe lights, my body doesn’t want to work with my brain! I shakily make my way halfway up the stairs and dad meets me at the top and asks me to go put his food in the fridge for him! PHEW!!! 

I went back to being alone downstairs texting and talking to my friends panicking cause of this situation. I then realize it’s time for dad to take me up to school to catch the bus back to my moms cause it’s my night to go there and he rushes me up. So far I’ve made out pretty good not getting caught! I get on the bus which takes 1.5hrs to get to my moms. My mom takes away my cell phone. 
So I decide to go walking outside, get rid of some of the energy I had (basically a pure adrenaline rush) as well as avoiding mom and SD seemed like a win. 

At bedtime I was showing no signs of improvement, and was feeling very much like a caged animal when my mom told me I would not be allowed to go to school tomorrow and I panicked. I got into a yelling match with my mom and I tried getting past her to leave and she grabbed me by my hair, and I started swinging to get her to let go, and as soon as she did I took off down the driveway and hiding in ditches. It was a 5km walk into town, in the dark, hiding in ditches every time I saw headlights in either direction, and then found a pay phone and called a friend to come pick me up cause I just ran away from home. There was a nationwide search for me that night. 

The next morning I got on the school bus and headed to school. Where I was greeted by the principal and 2 police officers ready to take me in. They put me in the back of the cop car and all my friends were literally banging on the windows and laughing and crying. They took me down to the station and left me alone in a room for a few hours until all my parents showed up, but I never actually got in any trouble. 

And that horrible experience got me hooked on the stuff for a full 1.5years. First it was once a week, then it was 2 or 3 times a week. And then it was EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. Then it was 6 pills a day, just to sustain, not even getting high anymore. My SM, Ace, his gf and I were constantly taking the ecstasy. We got into some pretty bad situations sometimes. 

When I was 15 I finally decided I was tired of feeling like shit everyday, so I wanted to quit. I weaned myself off over the course of about a month. Ace was sad I was quitting but he still had people to use with so wasn’t too bad about it. SM was a monster about it though. Constantly trying to get me to keep doing it, telling me I wasn’t fun anymore, calling me all sorts of names, telling me she wants me out of her house. 

I did end up moving out of that house about 8-9months after getting sober but that’s a whole story on its own. It wasn’t pretty. It was a lot of drama and trauma.

1pddsuu,https://i.redd.it/x64113cei15g1.png,Hey everyone onboarding specialist + dev here. I built a tool for myself to train operators on HMIs 2.5× faster… curious if it would actually help you too,"Hello everyone,

I wear a few hats at our plant: training coordinator, onboarding specialist, and (on the side) software developer. For years I’ve been frustrated watching new operators take 10–12 weeks to get confident on complex HMIs and multi-step SOPs… while burning floor time, risking mistakes, and basically praying the best tech doesn’t quit and take all the tribal knowledge with them.
So I built something for my own team first (before we ever thought of selling it).

It’s a browser-based digital twin of the real HMI + the written SOP turned into a voice-guided coach. Trainees can mess up as many times as they want with zero risk, the system gives instant feedback, logs every click, and we sign them off once they hit 100 % a few times in a row.
Real numbers we’re now seeing at our sites (packaging, pumps, filling lines):
Average ramp time dropped from ~10–12 weeks to ~4 weeks
Zero training-related incidents or downtime
First-month procedural deviations from new hires basically disappeared
Trainers went from “ babysitting on the floor” to reviewing logs over coffee

We ended up productizing it (SimulaxAI.com) because other plants kept asking for it, but honestly I still think of it as the tool I wish existed when I was the one writing all the checklists and holding people’s hands through alarm screens.

Would love your brutally honest feedback:
Does this sound like something that would actually move the needle for you, or are there bigger fish to fry when onboarding operators on complicated equipment?
Happy to share the little 6-question checklist I now use to pick which procedures are worth simulating first if anyone wants it.

Thanks for letting me share  appreciate any war stories or thoughts! 🙌",1,1764789885.0,LeanManufacturing,0,1.0,False

1. Waltz of the Flowers should only be done in pink, romantic tutus. Anything else looks wrong. I particularly dislike orange or purple tutus for flowers. (Dewdrop should be in pale blue or pale pink, either a short Balanchine style dress or a classical platter tutu). 

2. I can appreciate moving away from super stereotypical Arabian, but I don’t like the peacock version because I don’t see how it connects to Arabian coffee at all. If someone could explain how a peacock relates to coffee, then I could maybe get on board. 

3. I don’t like the “Drosselmeyer’s nephew” character and think he’s an unnecessary addition. (And if Drosselmeyer is also Clara’s uncle, wouldn’t the nephew be her cousin?) 

4. In general, I don’t like when people get too experimental or try to “switch it up” with Nutcracker. It’s like Rudolph or Frosty the Snowman, or any other piece of media people watch every year during the holidays—they want something consistent, classic, and nostalgic. I understand that we as dancers get bored of the same thing year after year, but I do really think audiences like it that way. 

5. Clara should be played by a child/young teen AND she should be played by the same dancers for the whole show (updated from my last hot takes). 

6. There should be NO “sexy French maid” character in the party scene. Wtf is that? 

7. No “extra” divertissements like English. It should be Spanish, Arabian, Chinese, Russian, Marzipan, Mother Ginger, Flowers, and Sugar Plum pas. Anything else is a no from me.

There was a post about places to meet new people that doesn't involve alcohol and 'dry dating'. I have a laundromat and a marketing idea that occurred to me was creating a Laundry Dance Social. I've found some folks to teach salsa while you do your laundry. December 11 @ 7pm. North Tryon 2 Laundromat. Bring your dirty laundry and spend a couple of hours learning how to dance salsa. There is also a Colombian Coffee Shop and Bakery attached, Roasted Tinto. Didn't realize poster needs updating to 7PM.

I did nothing to provoke his outburst, he was being too grouchy so I stopped talking (benign subject over coffee.) He was “tired”. I have zero tolerance for DV so I quietly walked away. He apologized later but it wasn’t really a good apology (non specific.) I accepted, anyway.

He seems unable to cope with almost everything, moaning, complaining,  bitching even though he has ample time for his hobbies/interests. 

We have been married a long time and have children and I’m a SAHM. I do plenty, manage so much, work my ass off, deal with crises, help my husband out but I’m fucking done over functioning/sucking his metaphorical dick when he’s in a bad mood. We’ve been through so much and I’ve stayed loyal, try so hard to be a good wife but it doesn’t fucking matter. Nothing I do is enough. I do not overspend money, have no debt. I don’t drink, or smoke.  I don’t get my hair or nails done. 

I do have ptsd and a history of child abuse so I am filled with self-doubt that he’s mad because of *me.* Also, he wanted children as did I. We agreed on the number so that’s what we had.

We’re in our 50s now. I think menopause has made this all so much harder.

This is a follow-up to a previous post I made about my heart symptoms. 

I’m a 25-year-old female, and I just received my 24-hour Holter monitor results. I’ll discuss everything with my GP on Monday, but I’m feeling a bit anxious and hoping to hear from people with similar experiences.

The report shows:
	•	Sinus rhythm
	•	Occasional PACs
	•	Frequent PVCs: 13,708 (10.08%)
	•	Bigeminy: 5,839 episodes (4.29%)
	•	Trigemininy: 2,593 episodes (1.91%)

The advice mentions ruling out causes such as caffeine, stress, thyroid problems (TSH), anemia, infection, heart failure markers (NT-proBNP/BNP), etc., and trying a beta-blocker. 

For context:
• My lab results are all normal.
• I drink almost no soda or tea, and only about 2–3 cups of coffee per day.
• I don’t feel like I’m under any noticeable stress right now.

So now I’m wondering:
• What else could be causing this PVC burden?
• Is a 10% PVC load something to worry about?
• Has anyone had similar numbers, and what did your doctor do?
• Did beta-blockers help you?

Thanks in advance!

Went to the store, saw the lid I needed, checked the bottom, said it was compatible with the 591ml size, perfect. Buy it, next morning fill my cup with coffee, take the new one out of the package, doesnt fit. Well the old one is threaded, and the new one is not threaded. As I took it out I noticed the new one is not threaded but I thought they'd figured out how to get the silicone gasket to fit in one of the smooth parts where there isnt threading or something. You know, ""over-engineered"" as their marketing department says. And it was supposed to work for the 591ml size.

Anyways I doubt I can return this thing to the store because the package is now sitting on some vegetable skins in the trash. So I reach out to customer service and explain how I just lost a bunch of money because their lid system is unnecessarily obtuse and as the consumer who knew the size of their vessel and the product line its from, I've held up my end of the bargain. The customer service response was that I could return it within 30 days if it wasnt open so now go to their website and buy the right one.

1pddmcx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pddmcx,Caption by Hyatt Central Sydney review,"One-night stay in November 2025 booked with FNC. Me: solo F American globalist. I wanted the brand explorer badge, and a good value of somewhere just to sleep my first night in Sydney.
 
**Location:**
I had never been to Sydney, and at first map glance thought the hotel might be a little out of the way. While technically true, in that it’s not overlooking either of the two major harbors with big tourist spots, it was much closer to lots of interesting things than I expected. A big benefit is being a five-minute walk from Central station, where I arrived after a quick airport train trip. I started wandering with no plan after checking in and right away found myself in Darling Harbour, and had a nice couple hours exploring the city on foot- everything is a lot closer than I expected (though take that with a grain of salt- walking 7 miles is very normal for me). The area seemed safe and quiet and was close to transportation and dining options. The hotel is next to the Capitol Theatre, so if you are interested in seeing a show you could not be in a better spot.
 
**Check-in:**
I’m guessing this is a Caption thing- I checked in at one of two computer kiosks set up in the entrance area (not quite a lobby, more on that later). I would not have needed to talk to a human in this process probably, except at the end when it told me it would contact me when a room was ready there was no explanation of how that would happen- I was fairly sure I could get texts on my phone, but wanted to know if I should look for an email or app notification. I asked the staff, sitting just behind the computers, and they looked me up in the system and offered me a room that was ready then but without an upgrade (I ended up with a king over a queen bed, though could have waited for a better view). Since I didn’t think an upgrade would matter as much at this property for my needs I happily took the available room (this was around 11am). Also at check-in were a selection of (free) amenities to take to the room- like a razor or toothbrush (though there were already some things in the room, like a shower cap).
 
**The room:**
The room was nothing particularly special, but I will never take clean, quiet, and comfortable for granted so it was perfect. I was right off of the elevator so heard a bit of noise from that, but nothing from any neighbors. There were a few quirks that again, seemed likely Caption-themed, like some colorful art and patterned wallpaper. There was also, as explained at check-in, a carafe for water instead of disposable bottles. Each floor had at least one fill station, and I was personally thrilled that what came out was not super cold (only one faucet option). Also to my happiness there was a USB port next to each side of the bed. Everything in the room was pristine and functioning, which I would expect from a brand new property (this hotel opened about a month prior to my stay, though I'm not sure if there had been a different hotel in this space previously).
 
**The common areas:**
Another Caption-theme I picked up on when I made the reservation is the heavy emphasis on gathering in the public spaces. The way this was worded in marketing was little over the top for me, as I just want to sleep and eat in peace, but I think if you are a particularly social traveler the spaces could be more encouraging of community than others (I’m reaching a bit here, but you get it). I used “lobby” in quotation marks earlier because of the layout of the building- the entrance area at the ground level isn’t actually at the ground level- there are a handful of stairs up, or a wheelchair lift for mobility issues/extra large suitcases. That small area has the check-in desks and a small coffee counter with grab and go pastries. Up a real flight of stairs, or real elevator, are the areas they are really promoting as social- an area with couches, a room with a boardroom table you could probably close a door to to take a meeting, and the dining area. They call the whole thing ""Talk Shop,"" and online I saw reference to having events but didn't explore that while I was there. There is a gym but I did not go to it.
 
**Dining:** 
The dining options are open for three meals daily. As a globablist my included breakfast was the “breakfast package” of coffee/tea, juice, an entrée, and a side. The menu was not super extensive, as not all entrees were available in the package, but there was variety and the food that I got was simple and good. When I arrived the guest next to me somewhat angrily called the manager (?) over and asked if he could order, which surprised me little since that same manager had just greeted me and explained that ordering was done through the QR code on the table. I ordered through my phone, but the staff took the other guest’s order verbally so you can definitely talk to someone if you want. It was not crowded when I went, and I did not see anyone hanging out in the public spaces the two times I passed through.
 
**Overall:** 
I loved this hotel and would definitely stay again. The only new hotel hiccup I encountered was a fire alarm in the middle of the night (ok, actually 10pm but I had gone to bed a few hours before). As we were evacuating down the stairwell another guest commented that this same thing had happened a few nights before, and he thought the system might be very sensitive (he thought maybe a shower had set it off previously, but that’s unverified). We were only outside a minute before the fire department let us back in, even with the alarm still going off, so it seemed like they knew right away it was an error. The front desk held my bag while I explored on my check-out day (done through the computer) and the whole process was seamless and the staff were friendly and helpful. I would definitely seek out other Captions in other cities based on this one.
 
I also stayed at the Hyatt Regency Sydney and Park Hyatt Sydney, and will be including those in my end-of-year recap. Please let me know if I can answer any other questions!",2,1764789493.0,hyatt,1,1.0,False
1pddlzh,https://www.reddit.com/r/newborns/comments/1pddlzh/had_a_fun_day_this_weekend/,Had a fun day this weekend,"This might be a bit long, but I Just want to share my weekend experience with you, now that I can laugh about it.

My bf, who is a great dad and partner was away from Saturday afternoon until Sunday afternoon. The dog that he and his ex share was with us for the time as well. Now my bub is 5,5 month and overall, apart from some issues getting him to nap during the day, he is a relatively easy baby. Been sleeping 3 hour stretches at least from day 4 pp or so and building up to 6-9 hours stretches recently and overall happy baby. Now, when the dog is at our place, he gets a bit less attention then before bub was here, but overall is a spoiled dog and very good boy, and is calm and understanding the shift so to say. So I forsaw no problems going into the weekend…

Lo and behold, Saturday is the day a new set of teeth are coming in, so after our walk at 18.30ish I put him to sleep (regular bedtime) I try to spend some playtime with the dog, but bub keeps waking up and being fussy, and I cuddle him to sleep a few times, so at a certain moment I go to bed as well to be near. So dog had no attention. I let him pee in the yard when I got up at night to make a bottle, and it was a long night with lots of cuddles, sleeping on me, next to me, 2 smelly poopy diapers, lots of fussiness etc. I gave him some extra paracetamol around 5ish and we have 2,5 hour stretch of sleep until  8ish. Bub does a lot better during the day so is more happy, with his bite ring. I feel sad for the little attention the dog had so I feed bub, play a little and get him dressed when his first nap is due and decide to but baby in pram to sleep while we walk to the park about about 15 minutes away where doggie can walk around off leash. So far so good.

Bub has been rolling a lot and on that moment decided he can also roll on his belly in the pram. Also, his teething is probably painfull so he is pressing his cheeks on the pram and crying. I keep flipping him back but he keeps rolling. I walk around a bit hoping he will fall asleep, but a certain point I turn him back around and decide to go home and maybe just cuddle him to sleep as I feel bad. At the moment I am doing this, I see in the corner of my eye the dog rolling on the floor… I try to go there an call him, but it’s too late! His whole front is covered in gooseshit, like a huge sticky chunk and it smells like shit and vomit ;(, while my baby is rolling around him pram crying his eyes out from the pain which I can not take away. I am thinking I cannot bring this dog into my house because I will need to burn everything and man, I had an exitential crisis. 

I was on the verge of crying. I messaged my boyfriend, who was about 1,5h away and they left to come back straight away. I walked around for a bit a decided not to keep turning bub back on this back and luckily he fell asleep a bit later. Although not ideal, I could see his nose and he was not constricted so I decided to just let it be and went to a park cafe to get a coffee and wait there for my bf to pick me up. About 5 minutes before they arrived bub did a large poop as well. I cried from happiness when they got there :P

His ex took the dog home to wash and bf let me take a nice hot bath when we got home. 

Now I can laugh about it luckily.

I recently bought a Sage Barista Express (two days ago), and I’m still figuring out if I’m using it correctly.

I want to make a *double shot espresso*, so I’ve been using the **single-wall, double-cup filter basket** (which holds about 18g of coffee). My question is: when I’m extracting, should I press the **single-cup button** or the **double-cup button** on the machine?

So far, I’ve been pressing the double-cup button with the double filter basket. But now I’m wondering—does that mean I’m actually pulling a “double-double”? If that’s the case, it might explain why I’ve been getting headaches after drinking two lattes.

Will this pre-ground work with V60 Switch? Or is it just something I need to throw out?

**Long Version:**

Due to various factors (grinder getting delayed, coffee beans running out, new coffee lot needs to rest for at least 10 more days), I thought of getting something cheap from quick-commerce (which I assumed would be old enough to skip the resting part) for the time being. Saw this ""Peaberry Coffee"" with decent rating on Instamart (4.3), and my dumb-self didn't check for anything else and bought it. Lo and behold! When I held it in my hand I realized that  this is ground coffee and not the beans 🤦.

Now, I don't want to waste coffee--so was thinking of making it work with a V60 switch? Can this somehow worth with it? Temp regulation, pour management, steeping/not-steeping, anything to make it work? As I really hate wasting coffee, and more importantly, wasting money 😁!

I am looking to build a coffee brand to serve all your coffee needs . However I am gonna start with selling coffee beans.

  
However I need small help from the people who are more knowledgable than me.

As I am just starting it my plan is to source the green beans from aggregators and setup roasting system on my own.Currently I am not very well verses with the cupping methodology and my sensory techniques but  I want to provide information about the notes of the coffee to the consumer. Should I go and hire someone for this purpose or should I learn these things from institute like SCAI ?

1pddd5h,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pddd5h,Identify coffee table/art style,"This is a coffee table I inherited from my mother who inherited it from my grandfather. Unfortunately both are gone now, and I'd like to have the artwork under the glass top restored and converted into a wall-hung piece, as it is sentimental to me rather than functional and therefore very difficult for me to keep as-is in my relatively small house. When I mentioned this plan to my grandmother she said she thought she had been told it had originally been artwork that was turned into a coffee table, but she also only ever saw it as a table, so I can't be sure. What I know about this table:
- Came from my grandfather's family in Queens, NY.
- Both of my grandfather's parents were first generation immigrants from Ukraine. It is extremely unlikely to have come from Ukraine with my great-grandfather, but it is possible it came from Ukraine with my great-grandmother.
- The artwork and glass top is 33"" diameter, the table is 36.5"" diameter. It sits 17"" off the ground.
- The artwork is not attached to the back of the glass top, it is applied to the substrate and the glass top is set overtop it.
- There is no maker's mark that I could find.
- Age is unknown, but must be a minimum of 80 years old based on family timeline.

I can't even figure out what kind of style this is. Reverse image search shows me stuff that could be the same style, but the styles are known for being realistic rather than abstract. I am hoping someone here can help me identify what kind of piece this is and maybe even point me in the direction of a restorer who can help me with it.",1,1764788932.0,VintageFurniture,1,1.0,False

Everything started during one week of the semester where i was bloated during a lecture.I was sick and when i am sick i get a little gassy,i think i let out like two small(I did not do it on purpose).Some guy behind me noticed and he wouldn't stop talking about it.And this interaction started everything.

Most people know each other in my uni,and if they don't know everyone,they know for sure 10-15 people that they talk to.I don't know that many,i only have like two friends and i mostly stay alone.I think that made me a target.

Now everyone says i smell even though i have NEVER gone to uni without showering that same day,i always wear deodorant (i even reapply when i get there)and i always wear new washed clothes.I think the problem was synthetic shirts,so i changed that.I didn't know synthetic shirts could trap so easily bacteria, I didn't grow up with a mom to know these basic things.

The bad thing is that they talk about me EXACTLY behind my back.And i can hear them talking everyday.And they talk loudly.And they won't shut up during the lectures too, but i have to go because the subjects are mostly math based.

Except when i was sick , I don't think i let out gas,unless i do it without knowing,but is that possible?I drink coffee in the morning to poop so i won't have any problems,and then i shower.(when i don't poop in the morning i feel more bloated).Today i didn't eat anything and it was 1 pm and my stomach growled so loudly and i said sorry quietly (idk why i said that pls end me),so i gave them another reason to talk badly about me again,great.I heard them say that something smells even though it was just my stomach.

I am so so tired of this whole thing.Every day i wake up anxious and i struggle a lot to wake up early, and i get late to uni most of the times.I struggle to study too because i think i am starting to get depressed.

I don't have many options on to where to sit because I don't have that good eyesight, and wherever i sit i can still hear them during the lectures because they are that loud...There is also someone else in our class that makes really loud noises too and i took the blame(just my luck)

I don't know what to do.I changed shirts,i bought perfume,i sat somewhere more far,and tomorrow i will fix my glasses to sit even further,i went to a doctor(didn't help)

For the past couple of years she’s let me customize a bi-phasic schedule using two different strengths of oral birth control to manage perimenopause symptoms. At my visit today we talked about adding compounded testosterone to help with low libido and clitoral atrophy.

I have labs coming up in about 10 days, and she mentioned she’d be hesitant to prescribe testosterone if my cholesterol or testosterone levels are too high. 

So now I’m wondering:

Is there anything realistic I can do in the next ~10 days to bring down cholesterol and/or testosterone before going in for lab work?

Background:
	•	My last lipid panel was 2 years ago during a time when I was eating terribly (2 months remaining of orthodontics). Total cholesterol was slightly high but my LDL/HDL ratio was fine.
	•	I lift weights 2–3x per week and do light cardio/stretching 1-2x per week.
	•	Daily supplements: 5 mg creatine, 10 g collagen, women’s multivitamin.
	•	Diet: dairy-heavy (eggs, yogurt, cheese), meat-light to get protein; trying to fit in fruits/veggies/grains but not always succeeding since my caloric needs are small. I consume plenty of water as well as 1-2 cups coffee or tea most days and 0-3 alcoholic drinks per week. Other than maple syrup, almost no added sugars.
	•	I have no idea what my current testosterone levels are.

I’m highly motivated to start testosterone, so I’m open to making short-term changes if they’ll help me meet the criteria for the prescription.

What are some short-term changes (diet, exercise, timing, or other tricks) that could temporarily lower cholesterol or testosterone before labs?

Examples: swapping weight training for walking, cutting/adding supplements, other dietary changes like oats/Cheerios, etc.",0,1764788679.0,Menopause,10,0.17,False

Eleven years of trading have taught me discipline, patience, and, above all, the brutal reality of position sizing. You only risk what you can afford to lose without blinking.

Tonight, the focus was Tesla (TSLA). A minor analyst upgrade had trickled through, suggesting a slight bump at the opening bell. It was a classic low risk play. I planned to scalp the first hour of market open, but I wanted to be in early enough to catch the pre-market momentum.

My routine is sacred. I use a dedicated workstation, quiet music, and a strong cup of black coffee, even this late. But tonight, I was tired. Earlier in the day, I had spent the afternoon marking up a plethora of stock market structures and researching upcoming news events. Ultimately, my focus was on Tesla and I was aiming for a clean bearish entry. 

P.S. (And yes, before anyone asks, I do analyze higher time-frame market structures before scalping on the lower time-frame. I want to see the whole battlefield.)

I navigated to the order entry screen, adjusted the limit price to catch the current pre-market bid, and moved to the quantity field. Fifty shares. That was my number. A manageable size. A $10 move either way was nothing more than a good dinner or a minor annoyance, so I typed 50 without a second thought. 

Or so I thought.

In the dim light of my home office, hunched over the keyboard, I must have double tapped the zero key, or maybe my finger slipped just as I confirmed the order. The system flashed: ""Order Submitted: 500 shares of TSLA.""

I didn't process it. My brain was already in power down mode. I confirmed the order execution, closed the lid of my laptop, and was asleep thirty minutes later, the planned, disciplined risk of 50 shares resting quietly in my portfolio.

  


My alarm went off at 6:30 AM EST on October 14th, 2025. Pre-market was already thick with news. For anyone wondering, news broke that the U.S. NHTSA was investigating Tesla’s Full Self-Driving system, which was a report that sent Tesla stock falling like a knife in pre-market trading. 

Now, my first habit in the morning is checking the P&L summary on my phone, before my brain is fully awake to process the disaster.

I unlocked the screen, swiped to thinkorswim, and squinted at the numbers.

The screen was saturated green. TSLA was down 4.13% in pre market at its lowest with 2.08% of that being a bearish gap. A few clicks and I was on my specific trade details. 

And that's when the shock hit me. The kind of shock that pulls the blood instantly from your extremities and makes the room spin.

Position Size: 500 Shares.

I stared at the number, trying to rationalize it. Fifty. I typed fifty. I *always* type fifty for this size of scalp. Five hundred shares of Tesla (at its current price) represented a position size ten times larger than my calculated risk threshold. If the news had been positive, if the price had skyrocketed, I could have lost a substantial chunk of my account in minutes. My breathing grew shallow and ragged. I felt physically sick, the discipline of fifteen years crumbling under a single, accidental keystroke.

Then, I looked at the profit column.

The accidental order had executed perfectly just before a massive wave of selling pressure. The sheer scale of the position meant the small percentage gain translated into an impressive dollar figure. It was in the four figures. 

I scrambled out of bed, heart hammering, and raced to the desktop. My fingers, now steady with a mixture of terror and adrenaline, went to war with the keyboard. The market hadn't opened yet, but the limit order went in immediately to buy back the 500 shares. 

Confirmation. Order filled. The funds cleared, and the screen flashed a P&L figure that dwarfed any single day's profit I had ever made. 

I leaned back in the chair, feeling the violent swing from stomach churning panic to overwhelming, giddy relief. It was a pure, unadulterated stroke of market luck, an unintended high leverage bet that paid off spectacularly, simply because I was too tired and careless to notice the extra zero.

The experienced trader in me was disgusted by the reckless exposure. The human in me was already planning how to spend the accidental windfall. I poured the coffee, sat back down, and made a new rule that day: Always double check the zeros, even when you're half asleep. And maybe, just maybe, be grateful when the market forgives your biggest mistakes.

1pdd6tz,https://i.redd.it/7v2z1z6fe15g1.jpeg,Domestic symbolism in Gilmore Girls,"Hello, fellow coffee addicts! Recently, I've been thinking about symbolism in *Gilmore Girls* – specifically, how do houses and buildings serve as domestic metaphors for the show's emotional and narrative arcs?

The first example that comes to mind is Season 3, Episode 17, “A Tale of Poes and Fire.” The episode ends with Lorelai, Michel, and Sookie meandering through the charred remains of the Independence Inn. In a parallel scene, Rory walks into her bedroom to find that Lorelai has quietly swapped her Harvard paraphernalia for Yale gear. What should be a moment of shared triumph feels curiously anti-climactic. Rory has worked toward Harvard her whole life but has a last-minute change of heart. Lorelai, who forged her identity as a savvy businesswoman at the Independence Inn, the home where she “took \[her\] first step,” grapples with its destruction. In retrospect, was this episode the beginning of the end of *Gilmore Girls* as we knew it in the first three seasons – a show about a self-contained, fast-talking, “freakishly linked” mother-daughter duo in the kooky but loving town of Stars Hollow? There’s an inexplicable heaviness to the closing scene.

It makes sense, then, that Season 4 explores the evolution of Lorelai and Rory’s unconventional mother-daughter relationship when the latter goes off to college. It doesn’t seem accidental that Rory has her first sexual experience in her childhood bedroom, which symbolizes not a literal ""loss of innocence"" but a loss of the fantastical, childlike innocence Lorelai – and, by extension, all of Stars Hollow – has long projected onto Rory. When she sleeps with married Dean, she's no longer ""the good kid,"" to use Lorelai's parlance. She becomes flawed and fallible, and their temporary summer rift foreshadows the deeper estrangement to come.

Now, let's fast forward to Season 5, Episode 22, ""A House is Not a Home."" The title itself exemplifies the show's ongoing domestic symbolism. This episode marks the beginning of the infamous rift between Lorelai and Rory, and it ends with Rory unpacking her books in the pool house while Lorelai watches from a distance with a mixture of sadness and disappointment. They make brief eye contact, but Rory looks away first and resumes unpacking. She moves into a new house, but it couldn’t be any further from the home she shared with Lorelai.

This theme of spatial distance also extends beyond their nuclear relationship. Shortly afterward, Lorelai and Emily begin renovations – Lorelai on her home in Stars Hollow and Emily on the pool house where Rory is now living. These parallel renovations highlight the emotional upheaval that unites all three generations, as each woman reshapes her space as a reaction to loss. Before Emily’s redesign is complete, Rory finds herself in a liminal, half-furnished room populated by a few armchairs labeled, “Sit on me.” Her isolation and loss of direction feel particularly palpable here.

In Season 6, Episode 22, “Partings,” Lorelai wakes up on Sookie’s couch after her impromptu therapy session with Lynnie. The episode is bookended by a scene in which Lorelai, after issuing her ultimatum to Luke, wakes up in Christopher’s bed – with a horrified look that nearly breaks the fourth wall.  

In the aftermath of their breakup, in Season 7, Episode 1, ""The Long Morrow,"" Luke broods among the ruins of his diner after Kirk humorously drives through it in Taylor’s Thunderbird. The damage inflicted on his diner mirrors the damage done to his relationship with Lorelai – serious, painful, but, ultimately, repairable.

Altogether, I think these examples demonstrate that *Gilmore Girls* uses domestic visuals as a kind of meta-commentary on the characters’ decisions, often their most consequential or misguided ones. The show even begins and ends with shots of Rory and Lorelai in Luke's diner, in their own ""little corner of the world."" I’d love to know if others have noticed these connections, or if there are any other examples you think fit into this theme! 😊",16,1764788552.0,GilmoreGirls,6,0.94,False

1pdd25j,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkAdvice/comments/1pdd25j/overwhelming_coworkers/,Overwhelming Coworkers,"
Hello Everyone,

I’m really struggling with a tough situation at work and could use some advice. I work in a tiny office with just five other people, and honestly, it’s been pretty overwhelming. These coworkers constantly come to my desk first thing in the morning to vent, share all their personal drama, and just invade my space. I’m a pretty quiet person who likes to keep to myself and only chat when I have to, but they don’t seem to get that.

Some examples, one coworker ran her hands through my freshly done hair without asking, others grab my purse instead of just admiring it from a distance, and I’ve even had  Staff Sgt. unload their relationship love triangle on me, expecting empathy. I try to be kind, but I really believe your coworkers shouldn’t be sharing that much personal stuff at work. I truly don’t care. 

On top of that, they abuse my phone number by texting me for work related things that could easily be handled through Teams or email. They even send me pictures or try to trauma dump heavy personal stuff via text, which feels totally inappropriate and overwhelming. It’s like they don’t respect my time or boundaries at all.

Most days, I just try to ignore it and focus on my work, but it’s exhausting because they’re always at my desk before I can even get my first sip of coffee. It’s draining, and honestly, not because of the work itself.

I’ve been emailing management about this for months, but nothing has transpired. Our managers live in Indiana , and honestly I feel like they couldn’t care less, they have a warm body in a chair and that’s all that matters. Now I’m thinking about putting up a polite sign asking people to only come to me for work related stuff. But Im worried that might come off as rude or make things worse.

Has anyone been through something like this? How do you set boundaries in a small office without causing drama? I just want to feel comfortable and get my work done without feeling like I’m constantly available for everyone else.

1pdd091,https://www.reddit.com/r/apprenticeuk/comments/1pdd091/a_history_of_double_firings/,A History of Double firings,"Essay incoming.

The apprentice used to have a very simple format. Two teams compete with each other. The team which won would go on a 'treat' (though that has been a stretch in recent years). One member of the losing team would get fired. This would rinse and repeat for 10 weeks until the interviews when two candidates would be fired and then the winner would be picked.

This worked perfectly for the first series of the show. There was a brief argument that possibly in week 6 Saria or Paul could have been fired with Rachel but it wasn't a big argument.

Series 2 changed everything. The 100 chickens episode. Sir Alan so wanted to fire Tuan and/or Syed (from a production pov Tuan tbh) alongside Alexa but he couldn't. Which meant both escaped a firing. This had to change.

And so it did. When the show moved to BBC1 for series three, there was the same number of episodes and the same format but with 2 extra candidates. Doubles were incoming

Series 3. Episode 2. Ifti and Rory.

This was 100% justified and Proved the point exactly why doubles were needed. Ifti had lost focus and wanted to leave (but just didn't want to quit) and Rory had been a disaster of a PM and had to go as well. Keeping either would have been a farce and so it was the right call.

Series 4 Episode 7. Jenny C and Jenny M

The best episode of the apprentice ever had one of the best boardroom's and Double firings ever. Jenny C had been on an exteme tightrope since the previous week and her actions on this task was a final straw breaking, while Jenny M had also been extremely fortunate not to go a couple of weeks earlier and had been a awful PM

Series 5 and 6.
Both these series were prevented from having Double firings as they both had candidates pull out just before filming (series 5) or after 1 episode. (Series 6). To be honest neither series had an episode where a double was really that necessary.

Series 7. Episode 5. Ellie and Vincent

Another very justified double here. Ellie had done nothing for five weeks and Vincent had just brought Natasha into the boardroom for no reason instead of Jim. And Vincent had been a poorish PM to boot.

Series 8. Episode 10. Gabrielle and Stephen.

At this point in apprentice history the doubles were done at the right points. Stephen had basically gambled the week before to save himself being fired by saying he would win as PM and he lost. And Gabrielle had run out of steam tbh.

Series 9. Episode 7. Kurt and Natalie.

It had been coming for both. Kurt had been lucky not to be fired for several weeks now and screwed up as PM. Natalie also had only 1 win to her name and not showed anything either. Easy double here.

Series 10.

Before I start I have to say that there were 20 candidates (4 too many) which meant doubles were almost the norm for the first few weeks which was a real shame as it took away the excitement. And also it meant some candidates got little to none screen time.

Series 10 Episode 2. Robert and Scott.

This almost didn't feel like a double firing since Robert was fired before the boys team even went to the cafe. And it was completely fair enough as well. Lord Sugar had suggested Robert be the PM and Robert refused, saying the task wasn't luxury enough for him. And then backseat the task anyway. So the instant firing was fair enough. Scott the Actual PM got the boot as well for being a dreadful PM.

Series 10 Episode 3. Lindsey and Nuran.

The second double firing in a row was deeply underwhelming. Lindsey wanted out and did an Ifti, wanting Lord Sugar to fire her instead of quitting the process. Nuran then got fired for not selling the candles well, a dreadful boardroom defence and for being a very week PM the week before.

Series 10 Episode 4. Steven, Sarah and Ella Jade.

Thats more like it. The first ever treble firing (outside the interviews) was very well deserved. And it was explosive. Steven had been a complete pain in the backside for several weeks and did an awful pitch to buzz feed which ended any hopes of getting the video on the website, Sarah was given the basic job of timekeeping which she couldn't even do and also had been dreadful throughout the 4 weeks and had been a appalling PM week 1 and an Hindrance to other PM's since. Ella Jade had been the PM to Fat Daddy and had done a poor job, so deserved to go as well.

Series 10 Episode 10. Katie and Sanjay.

We had a 6 week break between double firings but in the last episode before the Interviews, they had to get the numbers down for the interviews. Katie had been one of the strongest candidates upto this point but unfortunately picked the worst moment to have her worst task as PM which was also close to what she was going to produce as a business plan. So her firing was a shame but inevitable. Sanjay had been lucky to reach this point in the process and in a fight to the death with Mark, failed to win the argument and went as well.

In series 11, 12, and 13 the show had 18 candidates. 

Series 11. Episode 6. Elle, Megium and April

Another triple firing. And while two weren't a surprise, April's was. Sort of. Elle had lost every task up to this point and had failed at being PM (and handed over the PM to Joseph at one point in the task). Elle even admitted that Lord Sugat would have been a fool not to fire her. Meguim had the opposite route to Elle aka winning every task up to this point but hadn't really contributed to the wins. Lord Sugar realised that he had come several years early and let him go. However with April, this was surprising. He seemed to fire her for losing as PM in week 1. Which was harsh. She hadn't had a great week 6 and had made mistakes but that wasn't really mentioned. Instead week 1 just kept being brought up.

Now we were prevented from having a double firing by Scott correctly quiting in week 9. Otherwise we would have had a double in week 10.

Series 12. Episode 7. Karthik and Samual.

Now I don't really think a double should have been this week. No. It should have been week 2 with the jeans task. But whats done is done. Karthik went for being a dreadful PM. Samual's firing was a little more harsh. Everyone had a dreadful week 7 and Samual was no worse than anyone else. Yes he hadn't shown anything in the process but still.

Series 12. Episode 9. Dillon and Sofiane.

This double I had no issues about at all. Dillon was a lovely candidate but not the best in the world especially when selling and its clear Lord Sugar wouldn't have been a good business partner. Sofiane had been a poor PM in this task and had clashed with a lot of candidates to boot.

Series 13. Episode 8. Charles, Andrew and Anisa.

Another treble and the last to date. There could be a minor argument that maybe Anisa should have been given one last chance and be made PM but its a moot point. Charles had done nothing really for 8 weeks including as PM in this task, Andrew was completely unprofessional in this task and in previous tasks (including swearing in front of clients) and Anisa had done little but flapped for 8 weeks. Yeah I can see why Lord Sugar didn't fancy any of them as a business partner.

Series 13. Episode 10. Jade and Harrison.

What a shame for Jade that the only week she does poorly for is the week that two candidates get fired. Harrison had been treading water for a little while now and was a fairly easy boot. Jade was up against Sarah Lynn for the last final 5 place and lost out. A real shame that.


In Series 14, 15 and 16 the show went back to the sensible number of 16 candidates

Series 14. Episode 9. Tom and Jackie.

Tom lost 3 times as Pm but quite frankly should have been fired several weeks earlier so its a moot point. Jackie on the other hand was dealt a harsh blow as Lord Sugar decided he didn't fancy going into business with her and let her go. Bit of a boring one.

Series 15. Episode 9. Thomas and Marianne.

Both had caused the loss of the task. Thomas had lost 8 out of 9 tasks and really had run of lives. And Marianne had been in the Boardroom a few too many times but it was a toss up between her and Pamela but Pamela just edged it.

Series 16. Episode 10. Akeem and Aaron

We shouldn't have had a double this year. Shama withdrew due to health issues 3 tasks in so we shouldn't have had a double. BUT. The baby food fiasco meant that Lord Sugar had no choice but to fire 2 candidates. Aaron had created a terrible product that was more like wet concrete than baby food and Akeem was part of the first time dies labelling. Both had to go and they did.

Series 17, 18 and 19 went back to 18 candidates 

Series 17. Episode 9. Bradley and Avi 

Bradley had lost three times as PM which apparently means an instant dismissal (the fact that one of those losses was 100% Shazia and Avi's fault was forgotten). Not to mention that his packaging was garbage as well. Avi went alongside him for creating a product that stained people's skin green ( this really should have been a triple tbh because Rochelle should have gone as well)

(Even though we had 18 candidates in series 17 2 candidates were either withdrawn or they chose to withdraw meaning the show was restricted to 1 double firing)

Series 18 Episode 4. Amina and Jack.

The buy items task was a total disaster from the losing team that a double was inevitable. Jack was the PM for the rabble I mean team and was not great. Amina was pretty poor as Subteam leader and went as well.

Series 18. Episode 9. Raj and Maura.

This should have been a triple!!! Firstly Maura. I couldn't agree more about going as she had been treading water for weeks before. Raj I was okay about as well. While she had won the previous 8 tasks, I don't really feel that it was ALL down to her (though a couple she had done really well in) and to be honest, she had messed up big time. It was the question of Phil. He had lost the previous 8 tasks in a row, and played his part in the loss. But no. He was given one final chance. Which led to the fiasco below.

Series 18. Episode 10. Foluso and Steve.

What a joke. The whole episode was geared for Phil to win, which meant the team of Rachel, Steve and Folusa were always doomed. Foluso had been on a little bit of a downwards spiral since week 7 but was treated a little harshly. It was the fight to the death between Rachel and Steve that got me. I didn't want either to be fired. Steve was fired for probably not being exactly what Lord Sugar wanted which was unfair.

Series 19. Episode 7. Frederick and Keir.

The first double of the series was a little ridiculous. Frederick was rightly fired for not being a good PM who allowed a very childish money box app to be created and showed not great leadership. Its Keir I have the issue with. Keir didn't do a great pitch but it wasn't worth a firing for. And even if it was going to be a double, then Dean was far more to blame than Keir.

Series 19. Episode 8. Emma S and Melica.

Both teams lost the hot sauce creation task so we had another double on our hands. Emma S had apparently done 'nothing' since winning as PM in week 1 (which was bull, she was just edited badly) but her business plan was very iffy (basically a coffee shop) so that was a very fair reason that she went. GCSE A* Drama student Melica had made an impact however. It wasn't a great impact though. It was entirely fair that she went this week.

Series 19. Episode 10. Liam and Mia.

Liam had been treading in very deep water for a very long time now and finally fell through after having a hissy fit about not being Pm. Mia is the issue though. On the basis on this one task then you could justify it. She fought for the male skirts which was too much of a tough sell. However in the 9 weeks before that, she had been one of the best candidates in the process. But only this task counts apparently. I love it when Lord Sugar isn't consistent.

So this is all the double firings in the process so far. Who would have thought buying 100 chickens would lead to all this?",6,1764788169.0,apprenticeuk,0,1.0,False

please tell me your dream collabs below or what you would do differently about my ideas :)

  
David Lynch X LUSH

(i feel like there may be a very niche intersection of people that would really enjoy this, i also have a LOT for these, but will choose my favourites)

Wrapped In Plastic - fresh sheet mask, a light frosted blue and white colour scheme

My Log Has a Message - bubble bar, tree log shaped with a light gold lustre, piney, earthy and cozy, with a message inside (ideally a twin peaks quote)

Damn Fine Soap - shaped like a cherry pie, with a cherry and vanilla coffee scent

The Ear - LUSH melt - ear shaped (a nod to Blue Velvet)

The R&R Diner - candle - cherry, vanilla, coffee notes

\-

Pokemon x LUSH 

(given that we have had a mario collaboration, LUSH have that connection with Nintendo... i can't believe this hasn't been done yet)

  
this is more of a concept rather than a list of products like above:

Different sized bath bombs, in the shape of Pokeball's - (Pokeball, Ultra Ball, Master Ball) with different pricing, the bombs would have different soaps inside, similar to the Mario collab, but this time with the soaps of different Poke Gym badges, the soaps are rarer depending on which bath bomb you choose. When you successfully get all of the soaps (gym badges), there should be a link on the lush app, where you can verify it and receive a limited edition LUSH x Pokemon pin badge.

Ever wondered who would be today’s Righteous Among Nations? We talk to the steadfast allies who have fallen out with their nearest and dearest over the Jewish state’s war on Hamas

GEOFF Baker was always rather proud that his dad helped fight against the fascists targeting Jews in the East End of London in the 1930s.

As a journalist, and then PR to Paul McCartney, he also had many Jewish friends. One of his abiding memories of post-Holocaust trauma was when the former Beatle discovered a German venue he was playing in had been a favourite of Hitler: Geoff witnessed the deep discomfort of Paul’s Jewish wife Linda.

And so when October 7 happened, he wrote of his shock on Facebook and put a “I stand with Israel” banner around his photograph.

Two of his friends in particular took objection to this. The online rows became ever more bitter. “I’d write about my horror after reading an article about a woman who was decapitated by Hamas after she tried to fight off being raped and they would be saying things like ‘What about 1948?’ or ‘Did you see what the settlers have done?’” says Geoff, 69. “And I’d argue, ‘If you don’t want Hiroshima, don’t do Pearl Harbor.’

“This went on for weeks, all the rows were happening on my Facebook page. I realised I was inadvertently giving a platform to their views. So I blocked them and we no longer speak. One of them had been my friend since we were at school. I look around and I fear this new normal where it has become acceptable to be antisemitic and I don’t understand why no one is doing anything about it.”

Geoff, an old friend, was one of scores of people to get in touch with me after I put a call out on Facebook asking if any non-Jews had fallen out with friends over the Israel-Hamas conflict. I’d seen it reported in a More in Common poll that around four out of every ten Brits who were either firmly pro-Israel or pro-Palestine would consider dropping a friendship because of the war.

While I barely know a Jew who hasn’t fallen out with at least one person over the war, I was curious about how this issue had become so toxic for people who had no skin in the game – as it were – that they would fall out with friends. This is a conflict that is 2,000 miles away but its impact on our lives, our politics, has taken on a life of its own.

My post attracted 350 comments and was shared dozens of times. The comments read like a confession of pain. Person after person described how they had fallen out with friends, siblings, children and how sometimes the damage might be irreparable.

The direct messages also came in from people too frightened to say how they were feeling publicly. For many, the pain is abiding, yet they are also terrified about being further cancelled in this world of binaries.

In some ways, the messages were a balm: it has felt lonely being a Jew in this increasingly hostile atmosphere. These are people, strangers, who have our backs and have paid the price for their conviction in the most awful of ways. Sometimes that conviction has even involved them arguing with anti-Zionist Jews.

But also, they exposed me to a world of antisemitism that lingers beneath the surface – the way that non-Jews talk to each other when Jews aren’t in the room.

Let’s start with the left.

>

Joan (not her real name) is 61 and has been a member of the Labour Party since she was 16. She’s on the left of the party and even voted for Corbyn, although in the run-up the 2019 election she began to become concerned at the way he simply saw allegations of antisemitism in Labour on his watch as a conspiracy.

And then October 7. A day later, she saw people on her Labour WhatsApp groups planning to attend a pro-Palestine demonstration outside the Israeli embassy. “I’ve always been someone who has spoken against racism and antisemitism and I was shocked that there was nothing from my Labour branch about October 7, nothing from my local council.”

Within weeks, colleagues were putting together a motion to condemn Israel. When she pushed for a condemnation of Hamas too, she was ignored by colleagues who then accused her of becoming hysterical. She ended up leaving the party which had been such a big part of her life. “I see people I went through so much with and they give me the cold shoulder. They look through me. I do still have a few friends, and they show me comments that have been made about me on WhatsApp groups. They say I’ve become ‘far right’. But my politics haven’t changed. I believe I can be a socialist and left-wing without being an antisemite.”

Bella, 57, who is from the North East, joined Labour when she was 18 but saw the writing on the wall in the Corbyn years. Back then, friends began slowly dropping off but it was Israel’s war on Hamas that almost ended her closest friendship. “The woman who was a bridesmaid at my wedding started off being supportive of Israel, but as the weeks went by she started saying she wasn’t happy with what’s going on there.

“I tried to provide her with information but she was watching the BBC and also had a Jewish friend who hates Netanyahu,”  says Bella whose response was to start wearing a Star of David necklace to show her solidarity with Jewish people.

“I think the problem with the BBC is the information they leave out. So something like ‘Israel kills 28 Palestinians in an airstrike’ may be factually correct but they will leave out the context that it was retaliation to a rocket attack. For months and months, the news stories about the evil Israel is supposed to have perpetuated has been unrelenting.

“My friend has gone with this view that if you support Israel, you want to kill babies. We used to speak every day but our rows got so bad that we agreed not to discuss it. But it became a big wall between us and now we only speak every couple of months.’

Kate McDonald, a 62-year-old Australian, knows how she feels. “My friends – arty, leftist types, to a person – accused me of supporting a genocidal state. I had one friend who I was close to through our shared loved of dogs. She was a no-nonsense Aussie but she dropped me over the war. I miss her.

“The feminists have really let me down. All those decades for the law to take rape more seriously then, all of a sudden, rape wasn’t really a crime if Jewish women were the victims. I don’t even call myself a feminist any more.

“I will never understand the world’s hatred of the Jews and for me it is especially upsetting to see it on Australia’s left, which has always been quite small and rather powerless. Anti-Zionism has been a sort of gift for them, something they organise around.”

The war has also created  a massive schism in the feminist community. Last month, FiLiA, which hosts the biggest grassroots feminist conference in Europe, announced there would be no event next year because it was still dealing with the repercussions of the last one in Brighton, which ended in a physical fight between pro-Palestine and pro-Zionist feminists. The charity has referred itself to the Charity Commission for inviting a pro-Hamas speaker to the event.

Freya Papworth is a 41-year-old psychotherapist and abuse survivor who was part of the radical feminist movement and a volunteer for FiLiA. “The thing that shocked me after October 7 was the absolute silence on the feminist WhatsApp groups,” she says. “There wasn’t the usual response of: where are we going to protest  and how are we going to support our sisters.

“And then after the silence, it felt like sides were being drawn. I found myself in the middle of something I didn’t understand when I saw women arguing over whether the blood on the crotch of an Israeli woman’s trousers was because she’d been raped or had come from her handcuffs. This wasn’t feminism, or at least a feminism I recognised. A lot of academic and left-wing feminists are very anti-Zionist. I ran a FiLiA feminist craft group where we sew, crochet and knit. But what had been a place of sanctuary, somewhere that was meant to be fun, has became a place of censorship. When I posted about the march against antisemitism, I was told to take it down.There were whispers, silencing. Anyone with Zionist sympathies is made out to be a nasty, terrible person.”

Freya, who has set up a new movement called Feminists Against Antisemitism, ended up resigning from FiLiA, “which was incredibly painful,” she adds: “I am still me, but I no longer call myself a radical feminist.”

Things are perhaps even more stark in the Muslim world where being an open Zionist can lead to all sorts of hatred and pain.

“This might be a generalisation, but I think most Muslims are antisemitic,” says Ahmed, a 60-year-old doctor who has a Pakistani father and a white British mother. He spent his first few years in Pakistan, where he says even at school, “I remember being told that Israelis and Jews were very bad people. I remember an actual quote from my teacher saying that Israelis always wanted to take their revenge and this was a time when the country was more West-facing than it is now.

“I have quite a few Muslim clients and whether they are observant Muslims or Muslims who like to drink, they are all obsessed with ‘the genocide’ and how Zionism is evil. It shows me how potent the really fundamentalist strain of Islam in the UK.

“I’m an apostate and so I am not a Muslim. Before October 7, I was on the fence about the Israel-Palestine conflict. I essentially thought ‘poor Palestinians’, and that the Nakba was a real tragedy. But after October 7, I realised how the war had become a flashpoint for virulent antisemitism. I started to find out more about the conflict, I read social media posts by military experts like John Spencer and Andrew Fox and realised there was a lot of stuff people were getting angry about that just wasn’t true.

“I started to write a bit about it on Facebook, and one person I had real pushback from was a friend I’ve known almost all my life. I had to unfriend him because of the things he said. I’ve lost a dozen or more Facebook friends and more than a few live in Ireland. One person I trained with, who isn’t Irish but who moved to Ireland, around the time I started posting about Gaza, unfriended me as did her partner. And this has happened in real life too; everyone on the Pakistani side of my family – and I have about 27 first cousins – is obsessed with this conflict. It’s not that surprising, but it is dispiriting.”

Non-Jewish allies have also been impacted by antisemitism in the workplace – and the world of healing and mindfulness is ironically of the worst.

Lisa Li is a breath trauma specialist who has met Israelis through travelling, and visited the country several times. She has been shocked by the dehumanisation of Israelis within the well-being community.

“It has been pretty devastating to witness the naivety, the hatred and the blame,” says the 41-year-old. I’ve lost a few clients for writing pro-Israel posts, but it’s more acquaintances, friends and peers. There has been a slow drip, drip of attacks. There’s an inability to communicate. I’ve lost so many friends, and it has changed everything for me.

[Lisa Li](https://preview.redd.it/atxoj4b1d15g1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=09383c30c3fadb58faba05da7ad5390d71003e7d)

“People I’ve known for ever have turned on me aggressively, calling me stupid. There is one guy I know from this community who started by asking, ‘Why would you align yourself with Jews who hate you?’ and then he started ranting about how Ashkenazi Jews are not really Jews and then went on to how they killed Jesus. Antisemitism is so deep-rooted some people don’t even know they suffer from it. They literally think Jews are like demons on the planet. It’s wild.

“This particular row went on and on and the guy ended up saying, ‘Why should I listen to a childless woman who is uneducated and has nothing to show for her life?’ The whole episode was deeply shocking. And so I am left with my Jewish friends, my Israeli friends. For me, standing up for Israel is like shining a light – one that has triggered people’s shadows.”

It hardly needs stating that it takes a special kind of bravery to stand up against antisemitism on campus. Ciara, 21, is studying for a masters in terrorism and counterterrorism, but it was during her history degree that she first became interested in antisemitism. “I remember October 7 and seeing people celebrating it and I didn’t really understand what was going on, so I started researching it,” she says. “I did a module on antisemitism and I remember distinctly a moment in the library when a friend turned to me and said, ‘Do you remember when the war started and Netanyahu looked really sick? And now he’s killing all these Palestinian children and it’s like the blood of these children has rejuvenated him.’

“I said to him, ‘We have just come out of a lecture about the blood libel and you were in the lecture and now you are saying this?’ He replied: ‘I just don’t like Netanyahu.’ I started to write on social media how Hamas had consistently said no to a peace agreement. And people started unfollowing me. These were people that I had been friends with for years, who I had lived with even.

>

“Sometimes it’s the scale of the ignorance that shocks me. I have a job in a coffee shop and the staff were going on about how the ‘genocide’ was so bad. I asked them about October 7 and they said, ‘What happened on October 7?’ A lot of them are getting information from TikTok, especially clipped videos from Al Jazeera. They take it as gospel.

“They go on and on about ‘genocide’ but when I ask them to look at the numbers who died in Iraq and Afghanistan, they shrug. I am still trying to wrap my head around this and my only conclusion is that this is antisemitism. The funny – not funny – thing is that one girl I was friends with at university who decided not to be friends with me any more over this has a job as a diversity inclusivity apprentice.”

Ciara is brave but lonely. Most of the friends she has found are Jewish or non-Jews who feel like her. “I have another non-Jewish friend who is studying English, and there was a lecture about colonialism in which the lecturer launched into how Israel is a colonial state. She put her hand up and said this wasn’t true, as the Jewish people are indigenous to Israeli, and he called her out in front of her entire class: ‘Look! She’s a Zionist.’ She’s OK now but at the time it was really hard for her.”

And even people who don’t move in communities where the Israel-Palestine question is likely to come up have encountered antisemitism – from their friends and family.

“One person who had seen my Facebook posts on Israel said, or rather spat, ‘You know what, you sound like… one of them,’ says Oliver, 46, who works in textile manufacturing.

He shows me a long message from one former friend who said: “Denying Gaza’s starvation is no less vile than denying the Holocaust.” Another wrote to tell him, “Your eyes are blind and your soul is blackened.”

>

“My mother has forbidden politics chat on our family WhatsApp group after my brother-in-law and my brother’s angry reaction to an article I shared about antisemitism,” he says. “On a more positive note, a once-close school friend who I had connected with on Facebook suddenly started liking my pro-Israel posts. We started DM-ing and I discovered that he had kept his Jewish identity a secret throughout our schooling. We are meeting up next month.”

It has been a real touchpoint within families. One woman, Sara, even described how, “At one point I thought my marriage was over and I am not exaggerating.”

Her husband was furious at her for posting online about Israel in support of a half-Jewish friend.

“My husband just likes the quiet life. He deplored October 7 but was then definitely impacted by the BBC’s reporting of the war.”

Another, Emma, reveals that she cannot discuss Gaza with her children, who call her a genocide supporter. “Friends, you can drop. You can’t do that with your children,” she says.

Diane tells me: “I’ve argued with my husband’s family about this conflict and I am the only one supporting Israel. They are very well educated and I have always admired their insights. What I don’t understand is why they feel so strongly about this conflict when they are not emotionally involved. I am dreading Christmas this year.”

>

What is it about this conflict that generates such anger? It is something many of our non-Jewish allies are struggling to understand.

James, 50, who works in publishing, has one friend who has blocked him with “no explanation”. He thinks the binary thinking that was so evident during Brexit has been exacerbated by the pandemic and social media. 

“I think a lot of what we are seeing now was driven by isolation during the pandemic and the searching out of connections on social media, of people who will agree with and affirm you,” says James, who describes himself as being on the left and who has also disagreed with a Jewish friend who has “gone full Likudnik”. If you forge connections in real life, they’re not quite so self-selecting.

“People have become so used to having their opinions reinforced that they see them as indisputable moral absolutes,” he says. “Thus, anyone who disagrees with them is doing so in bad faith, and means you harm.

“And the pandemic encouraged conspiratorial thinking – the origin story of which is always antisemitism, a hatred that is so sunk so deep in Western culture, people just parrot it without realising what they are doing.

“How often do we hear people say ‘Israel kills babies’ but not say the same about Russia, or Sudan, or Syria? The truth is that if you cared about Palestinians, you wouldn’t laud political groups that literally celebrate their own civilian casualties.

“It’s analogous to the Carthaginians burning their children alive to satiate Moloch.

“When people explain what ‘Free Palestine’ actually means, you understand that the impulse is hating the Jewish state. Because the truth is that this is a conflict over which we in Britain actually have very little influence.”

Review:

My bags arrived during the Thanksgiving holiday week and I’m so happy with this haul. I picked up the Loewe Biker Puzzle in small (Jipin) and The Row Medium N/S Park Tote in cream (Kata) during Laomao’s 11/11 sale. The prices were amazing, especially for the Park Tote since I usually see it around $185 or higher. The leather on both bags is soft, smooth, and smells so good. I keep catching myself smelling them lol 

The Biker Puzzle is perfect. Jipin nailed the details and the quality is everything I hoped for. The Park Tote came with a crease mark across the front that I’m pretty sure happened from storage at the factory. I still GL’d it because once I start using the bag, it will get natural creasing anyway. (I already took it out for a coffee run and got a compliment in line, so she is definitely a keeper 😂)

This was my first time ordering from Laomao and he is so fun to work with. His responses were lightning fast and he stayed on top of everything. He is on the TS list and I can see why. I will definitely order from him again 👏🏼👏🏼

I’m a travel planner using an AI-based trip planner (SearchSpot.ai), and I recently put together a 7-day Bali honeymoon for an Indian couple traveling Dec 1–8. Thought I’d share the outline here to get feedback from people who know Bali well and to help anyone planning something similar.​

**Context (Dec Honeymoon, Indian couple):**

* Visa: Indian citizens can do Visa on Arrival; process is straightforward.
* Safety: General “use normal caution” type of situation, nothing unusual flagged.
* Weather: Early December = rainy season, so expecting humid days, afternoon downpours, but usually decent mornings and very green scenery.
* Crowds: December is peak season, but they’re going in the first week, so they’ll catch the festive vibe without the absolute Christmas–New Year crush.

**Overall Strategy:**  
Go for a “Classic Romance” split stay: 4 nights in Seminyak (beach, sunsets, food, spas) + 3 nights in Ubud (jungle, temples, rice terraces, slower pace). The idea is to plan core activities in the mornings, leave space for spa/relaxation in the afternoons in case of rain, and avoid too many long transfers.​

# Itinerary Outline (7 Days – Classic Romance)

**Day 1 – Arrival in Bali → Seminyak**

* Arrive, Visa on Arrival, hotel check-in at a romantic 5-star in Seminyak (shortlist: beachfront / pool-access / honeymoon-style resort).
* Easy evening: walk on Seminyak Beach, sunset cocktails at a beach club, relaxed dinner nearby​

**Day 2 – Seminyak: Beach, Spa, Romantic Dinner**

* Lazy morning by the pool or beach.
* Afternoon couple’s spa (massage + flower bath type setup).
* Romantic dinner by the beach in Seminyak (aiming for one of those “table for two under the stars” style places).​

**Day 3 – Day Trip (Tanah Lot / Uluwatu Option)**  
Option A:

* Morning trip to Tanah Lot Temple for views and photos.
* Back to Seminyak for shopping/cafes and another sunset on the beach.

Option B:

* Half-day down to Uluwatu: cliffside views, maybe a beach stop, then back to Seminyak for dinner.​

**Day 4 – Free Day in Seminyak**

* Keep it flexible: more spa time, brunch spots, sunset beach club, or just chilling at the resort.
* Backup plan: if earlier days get rained out, use this day to shift activities.

**Day 5 – Transfer to Ubud + First Ubud Evening**

* Morning checkout from Seminyak and drive to Ubud.
* Check into a jungle-view or rice-terrace-view villa (ideally private pool or at least very “honeymoon” focused).
* Evening in central Ubud: stroll the town, casual dinner, maybe a quiet drink.​

**Day 6 – Ubud Highlights (Nature & Culture)**

* Full-day Ubud area tour: a mix of waterfalls, rice terraces, and temples. Example combo:
   * Tegalalang Rice Terrace
   * A couple of nearby waterfalls (like Tibumana / Kanto Lampo)
   * One water/heritage temple stop
* Back to the villa in the late afternoon; evening to relax.​

**Day 7 – Slow Ubud Day + Departure Prep**

* Easy morning: yoga at the hotel or a nearby studio, coffee with a view, last-minute shopping.
* Depending on flight time: either head straight to the airport or fit in a short spa session or cafe stop.​",1,1764787994.0,balitrips,0,1.0,False

Walking out of the cathedral I asked her “Did you know the child that disappeared?”

Lucia laughed “yes, little Constantin Coman, such a cute little boy. I would at times watch him and his sister Adelina when their mother had to leave for a few days”. She smiled as she approached the horse scratching his soft nose “Constantin always had an innocent little love for me, as most boys do”.

I pulled the reins from the hook and wrapped it around the horse's head “Yeah I remember when I was a boy I had the biggest crush on my baby sitter”. Lucia looked at me confused “baby SITTER? Why would this woman sit on babies?”

A sharp involuntary laugh hit my chest, at times I forgot Lucia is not a native english speaker. “A baby sitter is a girl who watches children while their parents are away”. She looked at me as I hopped up. She scoffed, “Well this is a stupid name for a Bonă.” I replied “Bonă?”.

“Yes a Bonă, it's like a nanny. There is a German word for a nanny that is similar to baby sitter, though I suppose I never really thought about it too much” she leaped up behind me on the horse once again pressing her face into my shoulders. I replied “I suppose I didn’t really think about the meaning behind baby sitter too much either, some words just end up being a word for something rather than a description of it over time.”

The horse trotted off away from the church, it was about mid-day now, and Lucia assured me Mrs. Coman’s house was on the way back to St. Michaels. The horse seemingly listened to her directions better than I did. I decided to get back on the topic at hand, “You know what English word I like the most? Scoot. It's just a word that sounds like what you’re doing. I'm scootin’ along, rolls off the tongue” Lucia piped up from behind me “I think we found the horse's name, how does that sound?”

“Scoot? Why not scout, there's a good name and it's only one syllable off” I said. Lucia huffed “I wasn’t asking you, I was asking the horse, how does this sound Scoot?” Scoot lurched his head back and gnawed at his bit. “See Herr Morning, he likes it.” I still think it's a dumb name for a horse but as long as scoot responds to it I guess that's all that matters.

We arrived at Mrs. Coman’s house near the edge of town. It was a little bland villa with rounded rock walls that looked like they hadn't been maintained. I let Scoot graze for a little bit on the overgrown grass in the front yard while Lucia and I knocked at the door. A young girl answered, she was dreadfully thin with thick brown hair that stopped right at her shoulders and tattered bangs sweeping across her eyelashes. Lucia’s lungs emptied as the child slammed into her for a big hug. They began to speak a foreign language, im assuming Romanian as it did not have the harsh characteristics of the german dialect. One word I did recognize was “Scoot” as the child ran over to Scoot, picking grass and pressing it against the poor beast's face.

What I can only assume is Mrs. Coman came to the door. She seemed sweet but frantic, like a spot of rain during a sunny day. Her and Lucia exchanged some words, eventually she gestured over to me with the only word I can recognize as “Lieutenant Morning” I figured that was my queue so I placed one hand over the small of my back and one over my stomach giving a short polite bow. Not sure why I bowed. I guess I just didn't know how to introduce myself in any other way. Suddenly I felt a little silly for it, and had hoped maybe they'd just assume that's customary where I'm from.

Mrs. Coman invited us in and we sat in the front room. Her words started to get a little more intense, and Lucia’s responses were getting quicker. Finally Lucia turned to me “uh she says yesterday Constantin went to go play and he never came home, Mrs. Coman have been searching some of the spots she knows he likes to go”. I asked where he liked to go, Lucia began interpreting, and after getting the response from Mrs Coman Her fierce green eyes grew darker. “He played in the woods south east of St. Michaels” before I could respond Lucia began arguing with Mrs. Coman. Exasperated she said “Apologies Herr Morning, these woods are known to be dangerous, wolves and other unsavory creatures have been known to live there. I am upset that she lets her boy play there, she says he is 10 and nearly a man, and he goes where he likes.”

I ask Lucia where the father of the child is. The mother, clearly understanding the English word for father, spits on the floor and begins ranting in her own language. Lucia turned to me before she was finished and informed me “The father left them 8 years ago, never so much as told them where he was going”. I replied “I apologize I should not have pried at that sensitive subject” with the mother still cursing the father lucia gently reminded me “You are trying to find Constantin, it’s your job to ask these questions.”

Lucia had looked genuinely troubled as we left the cathedral, her worry for the missing boy written plainly across her face. These woods, I supposed, were the kind the Brothers Grimm might have whispered about. I felt my own concern rising with every step; from the way she spoke, I had half expected the boy to be waiting safely at the Comans’ doorstep when we arrived.

After a few more questions that got me no closer to finding the boy, we said our goodbyes and rode off back to St. Michaels. My mind raced, thinking of poor Adelina without her brother. If he had left only the day earlier it’s a real possibility he’s still alive. We only need to find some evidence of him going into the woods. Lucia and I began to worry since the cold night was quickly approaching, every night he spends out there the risk of him not coming home alive goes up, We don't have much time to waste.

As the Headquarters rounded into view I could see the new encampment the boys had set up while I had been gone. They moved uphill just outside of the courtyard of St. Michaels near my shack. A site I was happy to see after witnessing that creepy face in the corner of my room last night.

Their new camp had a sign post raised above the entrance “Aceldama”, a fitting name for the Outpost. Under it was Sergeant O'Toole talking with his two squad leaders. They could sense something was wrong. “Whatchya got boss?” uttered Corporal Bush. I began to catch them up on the meeting with Father Simon and Mrs. Coman, making sure to stress the importance of finding the kid and gaining the trust of Hermannstadt. They seemed to be in agreement, in fact I haven't seen these boys so intent on doing anything in the last three weeks of being their commander. I wondered if they were just happy to get an order that could actually help somebody for once.

O’Toole rubbed his calloused hands over his gritted face “We should go about this smart, Bush take your men on the southern end of the forest, Pike, you’ll go north. And sir, if you don't mind I think we should go straight up the middle. We’ll leave the horse here, he’ll be no use in that thicket. Oh, and for god’s sake someone make us a fucking pot of coffee, We’re not stopping until we find the boy.”

I said goodbye to Lucia, and packed my ruck with the essentials to stay overnight in the forest.

The camp erupted into motion and before we knew it we were ready to go. Pikes squad took a right at the church and followed the woodline north, Bush’s squad hugged the ridge heading south, before I knew it the silhouette of their bodies against the setting sun descended into the blackness of the deep valleys.

The sun slipped beneath the edge of the sky, and the warmth went with it drawn out of the air. The world turned brittle and still, the ground tinted in a blue, quiet cold. I felt suddenly misplaced, as if the day had forgotten to take me with it. Yet I charged on brushing past the tall grass into the pines that stretched before me.

The bitter dark swallowed us as we stepped deeper into the woods. O’Toole and I raised our flashlights, their warm bulbs hissing to life. Thin beams cut through the trees, stretching across the tall, narrow trunks like searching fingers. We swept the light left to right, then back again, hypnotic and methodical; hunting for footprints, a torn scrap of cloth, anything that might guide us.

From the distance we could hear the wolves howling. I looked back at O’Toole, “Would probably help if we called out for Constantin right?”. O’Toole spoke up from behind me “Apologies sir, I’m used to light and noise discipline on patrols”.

We called his name into the dark, only for the wolves to answer, their howls drowning our voices before we tried again. For hours we combed the rolling folds of those hidden woods. The forest felt alive, aware, guiding us down narrow game trails that drew us deeper into the unknown. All we could do was follow, because the only way forward was to let it lead.

Suddenly we heard a distant call of “Constantin!” just as we had been calling it. Knowing we were gonna intersect with CPL Pike soon we decided to head towards the distant calling like a wolf to the pack.

As we trekked, the pines thinned without warning, their evergreen rigidity giving way to a hollow where life seemed to hold its breath. In the center stood a cluster of deciduous trees, creeping lifeless things, their branches clawing faintly at the black above. The darkness here was a pitch. A thick tar that had learned to expand. It crept around us, clinging to our coats and skin, swallowing the sound of our own footsteps.

The trees had shed their leaves only a short time ago, their limbs drawn in tight, as if in some deep, dreamless sleep. Yet there was something familiar in their stillness, a patience that didn’t belong to sleep but to waiting. Waiting for spring. Waiting to wake. Waiting for life. As the wind slid between the pines, even the air seemed careful not to disturb them.

I heard the familiar “constantin” but this time it was a slight whisper echoing across the dead leaves. I turned my flashlight to the source of the frustration. Only to see a twisted and knotted oak with hollow dead vines winding its way up the trunk.

Suddenly one of the vines began to move across the trunk tucking itself away. In a brief flash I recognized it not as a vine, but as an arm. I lurch forward yelling “Constantin!” but O’Toole pulled my jacket “Sir, we gotta go.” I protested “It could be Constantin! We gotta look”, but O’Toole dragged me “You’re seeing things sir, Now hurry up or we’ll miss the rendezvous.” We continued east for a while. Occasionally I'd hear what sounded like “Constantin” from behind me, but it was cracked and compressed. I’d go to turn my flashlight around and O’Toole would pull it back forward. “It’s just a raven mocking us, keep walking” he said in a hushed and hurried voice.

Eventually we left the blackness of the hollow and into a clearing where the waning crescent of the moon lit our way forward. Ahead flashlights danced against the rigidly straight pine woodline across the clearing and we walked towards the voices of Corporals Pike and Bush.

“O’Toole why couldn't we just look? Why were you in such a rush to get out of there?”. O’Toole kept his course and pulled me in closer as if someone could hear us. “As soon as we heard Constantin the wolves stopped howling.”

“What?” I exclaimed in a dulled voice.

He continued, “If it’s one thing I learned, when the animals are silent you should follow their lead.” Frustrated that he was speaking in riddles, I decided to speak plainly, “I saw an arm…I thought it could be the boys.” he interjected, “I know, I saw it too. That was no boy's arm, it had too many veins to be from a kid, whoever that was, was no friend to us.”

We paced through the field, our weary hearts quickened by the events that just took place. The night air bit deep and made my chest feel banded in iron. We creaked through the woodline like a willow branch. On our approach one of the men shined their flashlights at us “Jesus sir, way to scare us” I could recognize Cpl Pike’s voice anywhere. His uniform was smeared with the earth. The boy looked frayed, like a wool coat beaten against stone. O’Toole whispered behind me “It wasn't hard to find you, you all sound like a bunch of elephants stampeding through the forest.” “An elephant would be a welcome sight in these woods,” Bush said, kicking frozen leaves from his boots.

I pulled us into a huddle so that our hushed words could not be heard by friend nor foe, “Sounds like someone was also giving you boys a fright out there.” CPL Bush responded “more like something, not someone.” We all looked down at the ground knowing that though it sounded crazy he was right, there was something wicked about these woods.

We all knew these woods weren’t safe, something was out there lurking in the night. To make it out while it's still dark we would have to patrol silently and without the aid of flashlights; a task that may have been doable under the cover of a full moon, but no such luck was with us tonight, these woods proved to be too dangerous to navigate at night. We all decided we should make a scout camp and ruck out at first light. Pike pointed out a defensible ridge near an abandoned hut a km north that felt “safe” to him. With the plan settled we went up and down the line tapping the shoulders of the men to move out. Soon enough we were in formation ready to ruck to the top of the ridge.

We were all scared, though none of us had the guts to say it. Naturally we all fell back on what we knew; be alert, move silent, and communicate. The foundation of being a good soldier and what’s kept them alive, for the most part. Being hunted was something I'm sure none of these men have gotten used to, but for me it was exhilarating. Some part of me smiled at the game we’d stumbled into.

We arrived at the location weary and ready to make camp. “No fires tonight” CPL Bush whispered around the line. We were going to do this the way the scouts did in the wild west, that meant no tents, no fires, no lamps, and half of the men would be asleep while half were awake watching for threats. With the rules understood we all hunkered down on the freezing ground. O’Toole asked me to take the first watch, I reckoned he wouldn't be able to sleep with the adrenaline. With that settled I placed my ruck on the ground, rested my head, and fell asleep.

I woke up to the Sgt shoving my shoulder. “Sir, it's time for your watch.” I cracked my eyes open only to see more darkness. The slight waning crescent of the moon only provided outlines across the night sky.

“Anything to Report?” I said tiredly.

“A couple noises here and there, the men are still pretty jumpy.” I cracked my bones to an upright position and told the SGT to get some rest. I pulled out my watch to check the time but I could scarcely read the dials under darkness. It looked like 2am, possibly 3am.

I sat there counting down the minutes to dawn for what felt like forever. Scanning the horizon for an unfamiliar figure. I could see some of the soldiers upright, we had all settled into a triangle formation around two pine trees. They were clutching their rifles and huddling near their watch partners for warmth. I began to shake and shiver; normally I liked the cold, it felt clean on my skin, but out here exposed every breeze felt like hot needles pressing against my body. My fingers began going numb from the chill, my lungs burned with every breath I drew and a cold clammy sweat began to fill my pits. This was agony.

What felt like days passed by as I sat on that ridge fighting off a fever the cold wrought against my body, scanning, listening for any creature to come in the night. I scanned to my left as I had done a hundred times before during this long watch that never ended, taking comfort in the fact my men were right there going through the same experience as me. I scanned to my right until my eye line passed the two trees at the center of the formation, but this time there was more than just trees. Between the two pines stood a third shape. Legs straight, arms at its sides, head positioned in perfect posture. It looked as if his silhouetted torso motionlessly rested upon stilted legs. A pit grew in my stomach. I suddenly found myself too weak to get up.

From the formation I heard a hushed voice call out to the man “ hey finish your piss and get back to your watch”. The man's head craned to the source of the noise, then he sulked back to the line and knelt down like a camel. Two hollow thunks rang out as he placed his knees onto the dirt, and sat back onto his feet. His silhouette sat straight and stared off in the distance. I turned back to my own sector knowing something wasn't right. We were all shivering, but he remained motionless, in the back of my mind I knew he wasn't one of us. I turned back to see him staring against the night sky. Who was this man?

The first rays of sunlight started to crest the hill. I knew now was the time to confront the shadow. I stared at my legs slowly coming into focus, grabbed my pistol, and careened my hollow neck to the figure. Except he wasn't there. Below where he sat, against the shadow of the ridge he was crouched over a body, it was a sinewy man dressed in nudity with furled black hair.

The sound reached me before the sight of it; a wet gnawing, steady and patient. When he raised his head I saw pallid eyes blown wide and lidless, jaws pulling at the flesh, teeth working the throat like a dog worrying a bone it means to splinter. It did not seem to even notice me, the entirety of his focus was on the consumption of a human.

I went to yell but only a yelp could find my voice. As I heard the other men rustling, noticing what’s happening, I pulled my pistol, aimed and took a shot. Striking the creature on top of the shoulder. I shot again, this time landing a blow straight to its eye. The creature rolled off its prey and began to run down the hill, arms flailing at its side.

By this time the rest of the platoon posted on a line and began cycling their shots into the foul beast. Except it kept running despite being hit more than a dozen times, a deep roar of pain filled the valley below us echoing across the ridges like a melody.

I ran over to the body and saw Private Halsin with a chunk of flesh missing from his throat. Pink blood bubbled from his wound with every gasp of air he took. One of the soldiers turned on his flashlight, I could see a mist escaping from his throat and whisking off into the frigid air. He looked over to me gasping and struggling just to meet my gaze. I’ll never forget the sound of his death rattle, that barbled from deep inside of him as if his soul was being parted from his body. I’ll never forget the look of fear in his eyes as the young boy, only 17, struggled to draw his final breaths.

SGT O’Toole whispered out “You stupid boy.” He was staring straight at private halsin’s watch partner. “You stupid boy” his voice grows louder now. “You stupid boy. You stupid boy. You stupid boy!” He stepped over Halsin and with the back of his hand struck the negligent private across his face. He crouched over him with his hands rung around his collars. “Private Breck” his voice spit venom at the utterance of his name “You lazy sack of shit. Up! Up damn you!” He effortlessly threw the boy to the side

O’toole hung his head low, and pushed his dusty hair back as he turned to him once more. “You will carry Halsin back, if you fall out of formation so help me god I will slit your fucking throat. This is your albatross to bear, do you understand me?”

Young Private Breck laid down splayed across Halsin on the ground. He tucked himself into the limbs of the lifeless corpse and attempted to get up. He struggled, with each try his breaths became heavier. One of the other men stepped in to help out of pity.

O’Toole pushed him aside, “Do not help him! He’s lost his right to be helped.” Private Breck continued to struggle moving the lifeless corpse of his friend. O’Toole barked at him again “I hope you remember this every night you fall asleep. You gotta carry this burden for the rest of your life because you couldn’t stay awake for one night on watch.”

Eventually by sheer will power Breck found the right angles to position Halsin on his shoulders. With no hesitation we set off back to St. Michael’s. I felt bad for the boy, in some ways, in a lot of ways, the punishment seemed cruel.

The war is over, yet still, not following orders leads to a harsh punishment. The war is over, yet still, young men die during their watch. The war is over, yet still, we’re so far from home. The war’s not over, so I’ll carry Halsin’s weapon next to mine.

We trapse gently through the forest north as it seemed like the easiest route to go. Past the abandoned hut eerily in the distance we trudged along. We moved silently across the hills and valleys apart from the gasping of air from private Breck in the back struggling to keep pace.

Though it seemed cruel I could understand the harsh method. Halsin’s last moments were a desperate grasping for breath and now Breck must suffer the same fate with the weight of the man he failed on his shoulders. It serves as a harsh reminder that mistakes cost lives. We simply have no room to give a man some slack.

As the forest grew thinner I could hear some of the men discuss the creature we saw. Their words snapped me back to a reality that my sanity hoped was a hallucination. The mechanical eyes of the beast gnawing at the throat of someone I knew was an image I think would stick with me for a lifetime.

O’Toole caught up with me, “I’m glad your colt seemed to scare him off sir.”

“Yeah I don’t really think it bothered him all that much to be honest, I just wanted that thing off my soldier” I said a bit plainly.

O’Toole, silent for a moment, spoke out “I don’t actually remember the first man I killed, coulda been a grenade, or a pot shot, not sure. To be honest it never bothered me none” I believed him. For the first time I can truly understand what would drive a man to wanna kill another man.

He continued “I remember the face of every man who died under my watch though. That’s what’ll stick I tell ya. Keeps me up sometimes. You get used to death but no man ever gets used to loss”

I’d been cold but I could tell this conversation was important to him so I humored him “do you hate them?”

O’Toole had an answer that surprised me “nah, I don’t think hate’s the right word for it, shit I don’t think there is a word for what I feel for them.” I belly out a saddened sigh “I’m sure the Germans weren’t like that thing though”

O’Toole placed his hand on my shoulder “I actually think we’re all like that thing. When I saw it chowin down Halsin, it didn’t have any hate in its eyes. It was just eating. Cus it’s gotta eat. The krauts killed us cus they gotta kill us, we killed them cus we gotta kill em. Eventually it just becomes instinct. The labels, good, evil, hate, purpose, I dunno. It’s just something else entirely I think.”

He fell back to his men, leaving me to play back the events in my head. My head was sickened with questions I felt there’d be no answer to. Peaking through the pine curtains I saw St. Michales proud against the hills of the black forest, I’d never been more relieved to see it.

Once we stopped at headquarters Breck fell to his knees and the lifeless body of Halsin fell to the dirt. O’Tool looked down on Breck “Quit being dramatic boy. Put Halsin in one of the crates, and we’ll find out what to do with him once the captain comes at the end of the week.”

Luckily the cold would keep his body from stinking too bad while we wait. I stuck around for a bit, letting the boys know I'm proud of them for how they composed themselves during the night. Their morale was understandably much lower than yesterday morning. They were scared, we were all scared, yet still we must press on. After a while I wandered back up to the shack to report on the incident.

I flicked the radio giving my report in little detail “25 assigned, 24 present, one killed on mission.” the radio reported back “cease all operations until Sunday."" An order I was happy to receive. Though I'm sure Mann was stirring to get on the next train to Hermannstadt to see what the hell could have killed Private Breck. Yet the next stage won't come until Sunday, so he’ll have to wait.

I lit the fire in my stove, huddled against it for warmth, then turned my eyes to the sweet relief of sleep. I don't remember sleeping that much in my life. Only occasionally waking up to stoke the flames before falling back into a deep restful sleep.

I woke up again right after dawn the next day and decided to force my body to stay awake. Walking out I noticed a thin sheet of snow across the ground, it looked like talcum powder dusted across the dead grass. The men were cooking up some breakfast again so I decided to make the short walk over to their camp.

Corporal Bush said his good mornings and added “Lucia was looking for ya yesterday sir, I let her know you were sleeping.” I poured myself a nice hot cup of coffee from the percolator and replied “You let her know what happened?” He replied “Told her wolves got one of us. I think she knew better though, smart that one.” I cleared my throat with a sip of dark roast before I said “I don't think it takes a genius to know 25 men armed to the teeth could’a fought off a couple of wolves. I’m not worried about convincing her what happened, I am worried about convincing Captain Mann though.” Bush Replied “Ah, well at any rate she’s coming by again today after 9.”

“Well she could help me write those memos to the new government for some extra supplies. But Captain Mann made it clear we’re not to move from the garrison until he arrives.” The men around the campfire seemed relieved to hear the news. The Previous mission had taken its toll on everyone.

The men went back to talking and I had resolutely taken a back seat in their conversation. Corporal Bush and Corporal Pike began arguing about whether or not they thought the thing we encountered was dead, Pike had obviously taken the position that he sent 5 rounds directly into its spin and he was sure it sat on the forest floor dead. Bush, in his superstition, believed the thing wasn’t human and it was still out there.

After a while I took my leave sending off another transmission for the day updating Captain Mann on our stagnant status. Then I went about the chores around the camp before I saw Lucia approaching the stone wall at the top of the hill. I wasn't as excited to see her today as I was the day before. I felt like she’d known what was in those woods but didn't warn us.

I walked over to her and before I could say good morning she embraced me. “I’m sorry I heard about the man you lost, where is he?” I ushered over to the crate at the front of the camp with a blanket of snow covering the soft plywood, “Over there, c'mon lets get out of the cold, we got some stuff to talk about.” As we walked further up the hill to the shack she kept looking back at the supply box.

I pulled up a chair for her near the radio and asked “coffee?” - “Just a little bit thank you” she rotated the cup in her hands, fidgeting with the question she wanted to ask, “your men say this was a wolf. Must’ve been pretty big.” The words hung in the air for a moment. “You know it wasn’t a wolf Lucia.” She continued to rotate the cup of coffee on the table. “Well if it wasn't a wolf what was it Herr Morning?” - “A man..but not a man, he was naked, cold, feral, and a funny way of escaping death” she had stopped rotating the cup. Softly but matter of factly she spoke “That is because he’s already dead.”

Those words two days ago would have made me laugh, but now it makes more sense than any other hair brained theories Corporal Pike had been spouting. “You must believe me, Herr Morning. Those woods have many dangers, but the strigoi is something else, it’s something meant to frighten you, drive you away.”

I asked her what the hell just killed my soldier. With a long sigh she began to tell the story. “Many years ago,” she said, “there lived a woman and her husband, happy as two birds sharing one branch. But one day the husband fell terribly ill. The woman grew desperate, she prayed over him night and day, and she tried every tincture, every root, every little plant she believed might trick death into walking past her home. But the sickness only grew stronger, and in the end, the man died.”

She paused, her eyes drifting as if she could still see the memory in the air.

“The woman was broken,” she continued softly. “Her heart was shattered. She began to pray not to God anymore, but to the devil himself, begging him to return her husband. And the devil… he answered. He told her exactly what to do.”

I felt the cold move through me as she kept speaking.

“One night, under no moon, the woman went to the cemetery. She dug up her beloved with her bare hands. His heart was rotten, black like wet soil. She tore it out. Then..” she tapped her own chest “she reached into herself and gave him a piece of her own heart. But when she put the heart back into her husband’s chest, it did not beat. She cried and cursed the devil for his lies.”

Her voice dropped to a whisper.

“And then… the man opened his eyes. But he was not her husband anymore. He rose and fed on her first. After that, he wandered the countryside like a beast set loose, killing pigs, sheep, people… leaving bodies pale and empty, like someone had drained them with a giant needle.”

She looked at me, her face pale in the fire's light.

“The city begged the devil again, this time to tell them how to stop the creature. And for a price, he did. ‘A stake through the heart,’ he said, ‘and fire to finish it.’ So the folk hunted the monster, and they killed it at last. But not before…” She hesitated. “Not before its evil had time to spread.”

The stove began to rattle, the hiss of heat came to a mear whimper. I rocked myself out of my chair tossing a couple more pieces of wood in the fire. I clutched the last piece of wood in my hands for a moment, turning it in my hands. “Wooden stakes huh? Guess the dime novels got that one correct.” I turn to Lucia, “do you believe these stories?” Lucia finally grasped her cup of coffee and pulled it close to her chest, “I do Herr Morning.”

I stormed out of the shack towards the crate “Pike! Bush! O’Toole! grab some men and meet me by Halsin! And bring some of those cedar tent spikes with ya!” I charged towards the box containing Halsin, as I peered on the other side of the crate I noticed a couple dead rats, some blood, and mud smeared across the sides. “Pike! I believe that Bush won the argument, that thing was a vampire.” They rushed to the corners of the box readying their stakes. “Stakes and fire that’s what Lucia said. But we’re not gonna burn it, not yet anyhow. We need to keep it alive-er dead?” – “undead?” Pike interrupted – “Right, we need to keep undead until Captain Mann gets here, that's when we’ll burn it. Until then we need to keep it sedated. On the count of three, lift the lid and I'll stake it. 1…2….3”

The lid broke open, and there lay Halsin inside the box, no frostbite, no rot, nothing to show he’d been dead at all. He looked as though he were only sleeping. I hesitated, just a heartbeat, before driving the splintered stove wood straight into his chest.

Suddenly Halsin began slamming his fists into the side of the crate rhythmically. The bones of his hand began to crunch from the impact. One of the men slammed his E-tool into the stake driving it further into halsin’s heart. He began gasping for air again as if he was reliving his last moments. His eyes began to open, staring straight at me. I quickly lunged the full weight of my body against the stake driven into his chest and began to corkscrew it until I could feel the wood behind his back dulling the wood like a pestle and mortar. Luckily his eyes began to shut once more.

“More stakes” I bellowed while still crouched over Halsin. The men began to spear his limbs to the crate. By the time they were finished he looked like an insect proudly pinned on a frame, each extremity splayed and pierced in the most spectacular fashion. Not a single drop of blood was visible from any of the wounds we’d left behind.

After the gruesome task I drolled out orders, “Alright boys now that we know what we’re dealing with, secure Halsin then fashion some instruments to defend yourselves.” Corporal Pike spoke up, “we found an empty sarcophagus in the church. We can probably lock him away under that stone”, I began to walk back towards the shack “do that, and put 2 on 24 hour watch. O’Toole! See to the preparations, that things gotta put on a show once Captain Mann comes.”",1,1764787674.0,u_Jorkin-My-Penits,0,1.0,False

                            I’m a 7th Year Public High School Teacher that is looking to transition into a career within the TriLi Systems in NYC. My preference would be NYPL Branches in Manhattan due to my commute, but I am willing to consider anywhere to get my foot in the door. The position I believe that I would be most qualified for is a NYPL Library Information Assistant. That is also the position that really excites me! 

While searching online & via Reddit, I researched extensively to help me prepare my resume, cover letter, for interviews, & generally what to expect with this position. But, I would really love to be able to connect with anyone currently working in the TriLi Systems, especially NYPL, for advice. I would be incredibly grateful to be able to do an Information Interview & buy you a coffee or beverage to hear about your jobs or any tips you could offer as I try to break into this career. 

This transition is something I have put a great deal of thought into already. I understand that the job market is very competitive & that I would be taking a pay cut. However, I have weighed all my options & discussed this with my partner. We have the ability to make this work. I am very determined to be successful & I want to be able to help my community with literacy in a meaningful way. 

Please reach out if you would be willing to do the Information Interview. If you aren’t, but still have any tips I would appreciate any comments on this post. Thank you for your consideration!

So this happened a couple weeks ago, and I’m still annoyed because I genuinely tried to be a good friend. My friend (let’s call her S) and I planned a short weekend trip out of town. Nothing crazy, just a break from work, some good food, a little sightseeing. She was super excited about it and even picked the Airbnb, restaurants, and activities. I figured we’d split everything like normal adults.

From the moment we arrived, red flags everywhere. She kept “forgetting her wallet” every time we had to pay for something. Parking? Forgot. Coffee? Forgot. Lunch? Oh, it must be in the car. Uber? Her phone died. The Airbnb check-in? She said she’d “Venmo later.”

I didn’t want to make the trip awkward, so I covered what I could and assumed she’d settle up afterward. She kept saying, “Don’t worry, I got you when we get home.”

Well… we got home.

And suddenly she “didn’t remember agreeing to split everything 50/50.” She said I was “ruining the vibe” by bringing up something “as small as money.” Mind you, the trip cost me a little over $420. Not pocket change for me. She then started guilt-tripping me, saying I made her feel “cheap” and “poor” for even asking.

I’m not wealthy. I budget carefully, and I’ve been trying to rebuild my credit this year and I plan everything to the dollar because I have to. Covering two people on a trip was not part of the plan.

What really blew my mind was when she told our mutual friends that I “ambushed her for money.” Like… girl, you planned half the trip. You knew the costs. You just didn’t want to pay.

At this point I’ve accepted the loss, but I’m honestly wondering if I’m crazy for thinking it’s normal to expect someone to pay their half?? I didn’t yell, didn’t fight, didn’t make it awkward on the trip. I literally waited until we got home.

Bealariq Coffee, kahvenin doğduğu topraktan fincana uzanan yolculuğuna sade ama güçlü bir bakış açısıyla yaklaşır. Her çekirdeğin kendi hikâyesi olduğuna inanırız; toprağın verdiği karakter, çiftçinin emeği ve modern kavurma tekniklerinin oluşturduğu denge, fincanda gerçek kimliğini bulur.

Bizim için kahve, sadece günlük bir alışkanlık değil; **özünü koruyan, karakterini yansıtan bir deneyimdir.**

Ancient excavated ponyfolk artifacts were held in display cases. Some which were obvious to the alicorn were labeled as ""unknown"".  Ancient books blood moon recognized lined the shelves... in a carefully mended state or seemingly copied by hoof. 

The room was strange, it had a kitchen and dining room combined, and it was within an open walk way to the living room.  Next to the couch Blood moon woke up on, was a low table, baby proofed with diapers and duct tape.  The whole place looked baby proofed as well. On the other side of the living room,  was a tele-orb set and some educational toys. 

There were low level magical safeguards all over the place it seemed.  It was probably for the alicorn foal with mechanically enhanced wings who easily tottled across the ceiling with a plush reminiscent of blood moon's long dead sister in her mouth. Casting eternal night apparently did nothing to satisfy her anger, resentment, or grief. The way Blood moon had been laying on the couch for a week since she woke up was evident of just how badly the ancient alicorn required therapy.

This would be blood moon's second week here. She wasn't even wearing her crimson armor any more. in fact the foal had scribbled all over Blood moon's royal armor while blood moon watched the orb set in self loathing. It would be about 30 minutes before the foal's mother figure would arrive in this apartment. Until then, Blood Moon set about using mage hand to grab the whole box of Lil Debbie and share them with the foal. Sailor Rat was on.

Former princess sandhoof arrived home, with a grocery bag in her mouth, and two more levitating to the kitchen counter. Outside, in the hall were two vermensk special forces guards...armed to the teeth. Upon noticing the mountain of zebra cake wrappers  on the coffee table next to blood moon, sandhoof grew irritable.

""SANGUINE LUNAE EPONA! Are you spoiling Sparklejet's dinner again?"" Groaned the unicorn in a cloak and wizard hat.

""Eyup"" Sighed the alicorn who lay on the couch for the second week in a row. 

As sandhoof went back to unpacking the groceries with a rather agitated mood, there would be a knock on the door that brought sandhoof some relief.

""Finally... Luna, please at least clean up those wrappers."" Sandhoof instructed as she opened the door to a vermensk therapist who was very hard to convince into doing a housecall.

1pdc93y,https://www.reddit.com/r/RantAndVentPH/comments/1pdc93y/boarding_a_plane_to_propose_but_my_mind_is_on_a/,"Boarding a plane to propose, but my mind is on a different woman I met two days ago","With an engagement ring I've saved up for, I am now boarding a plane to finally ask my girlfriend for her hand in marriage. While thinking of what's ahead, my mind is on a different woman... Someone I met days prior.

See, my previous relationship of 7-years ended because I cheated. I felt guilty. And I wanted to change, and listened to the stories of men who have broken the cycle, and they'd always say that change must come within myself, ""Kahit sino pa asawa mo, Kahit si anne Hathaway pa yan, if cheater ka, mag che-cheat ka talaga."" In the end, nasa sakin ang bola kung mag che-cheat pa ako, regardless of who I'm with and the flaws she has.

And so, determined to be faithful and never to cheat again, I went into another relationship with a beautiful woman who works abroad. I feel lucky that I've gotten this girl, she's caring, thoughtful, and mala-ilaw ng tahanan, plus a 10/10 looks wise, gets the stares everywhere we go, both filipinos and foreigners.

Despite these, our intellectual bond is weak. Our conversations tend to be shallow and boring. Most times, we'd call each other while doing something else on our phone. Her libido does not match mine. She likes it vanilla, I like mine chocolate. I’m more open to new ideas, while she prefers familiar approaches. She's the type to be closed off about her past (which I know about) and I'm open about mine. Don't get met wrong. There is nothing wrong with her, it just feels like she's oil and I'm water.

But, as promised to myself back then, the next relationship I will go into will be the last, and I will be faithful no matter what... Ika nga, nasa akin ang pagbabago regardless of the differences we have. And so, Kahit medyo boring ang conversations and sex, our relationship was working.

Fast forward, she was throwing subtle hints of proposal and marriage, which I initially thought I wanted to do with her too... And so,  months after her hints, I've finally saved up and bought a nice diamond ring, flight tickets to visit her, and expenses. 

As my flight approached nearer and nearer, anxiety began creeping in. Was I truly ready for this commitment? Could a marriage thrive on discipline and my values alone, without genuine compatibility? Were we aligned in the life we envisioned together? The excitement was there, but so was the weight of what this moment meant. Every mile closer felt like a mix of hope and uncertainty, a silent tug-of-war between love and fear.

And so, two months before my flight to propose, I’m not sure why—maybe anxiety, maybe a relapse—I went on r4r and met a few people for friendly, SFW dates. Yes, I know that counts as cheating in its own way. But I felt I needed to understand where I truly stood before taking such a huge step. The women I met shared a similar mindset and were on the same mental wavelength as me, but despite that, each date made me feel validated to continue my plans with my current girlfriend. 

Two days before my flight, I checked r4r again for the very last time I said. And I met with someone who was recently cheated on by her boyfriend, how ironic. I met a total of 4 women, including her, and while I had the same mental wavelength with most of them, this one was different - she had a warmth that felt like home, a smile that could turn a bad day into poetry, and a way of listening that made the world feel less heavy. With her, conversations didn’t just flow, they danced. We were like coffee and cream as opposed to oil and water. She was as open as a book, just like me—except for the footnote I never mentioned - that in two days, I’d be boarding a plane to propose to someone else.

Now, I am still boarding my flight, but not propose, but to break it off.. After seeing what it would be like to be someone who mixes with me naturally, I now know that this is the right thing to do for me and my current girlfriend. Not because I want to be with this new girl, but because I know that discipline and and willpower is not enough for a person like me to be faithful. It might be true for most, but not me, I think I can't be faithful to ""Kahit sino pa yan"", but rather only to people who can bond with me in a special way that touches my mind and soul.

Yes, I am a cheater. I feel ashamed and guilty. I am human. And I pray it's something I can conquer as a man. 

I can only wish that I met R in a different time. And just maybe.

1pdc7ps,https://www.sacbee.com/news/local/transportation/article313346864.html,Sacramento council OKs plan for better pedestrian safety — will it get funded?,"Sacramento’s City Council voted to approve the Streets for People plan, a policy document that builds on existing goals to create safer roadways, particularly for those outside cars. The plan proposed 567 miles of new or improved sidewalks throughout the city, as well as 417 miles of new or upgraded bike paths.

The document approved unanimously by the council notes that 11% of all trips in the Sacramento region currently rely on “active transportation” — human-powered modes of transportation such as biking or walking. People on bikes or on foot are more likely to die in vehicle collisions, and Streets for People aims to make cycling and walking safer. “This is the product of a lot of years of work, a lot of participation, a lot of commentary and real devotion by the staff,” said Councilmember Roger Dickinson, who represents North Sacramento. “It is an enormous step in the right direction in supporting active transportation.”

The council has declined to fund the recommendations of the Active Transportation Commission multiple times, and whether the City Council makes funding decisions to support the new plan remains to be seen. In 2017, the council made a Vision Zero pledge to eliminate all traffic fatalities and serious injuries by 2027. While pursuing that goal, the council did not make any significant changes to road safety funding until this year. In March, the council redirected $4.6 million of existing transportation funding toward a six-person “quick-build” team that will focus on rapid infrastructure improvements to dangerous roads. Over nearly nine years since the City Council set its Vision Zero goal, data from the Sacramento Police Department show that traffic collisions have killed more than 350 people. Since January 2024, at least 62 people have died in crashes on Sacramento streets. Of the 62 dead, 42 were pedestrians or cyclists, and two were riding scooters.

This year, Jonathon T. Slaugh, 62; Adrienne Keyana Johnson, 33; Cornelius Jesse, 59; Vuong Van Nguyen, 47; Natalia Regina Sanchez, 50; William Andrew Akens, 26; Ernesto Torres, 58; Zhen Cheng Kuang, 76; Thongthai Xanaxay, 55; Kaleb Josiah Green, 22; Kimberly Lynn Pickett, 60; Parris Shauntel Windham, 41; Michael Driskell, 78; Ricky Ray Reyes, 19; Jeremy M. Robinson, 46; James Lee Little, 64; Alicia Andrea Barnes, 65; Nedra Lee Franklin, 67; Gerald Hall, 60; Bee Lao, 46; Kyle Scott Silvers, 33; and Randy Allen Perez, 41, were fatally struck while walking or biking.

Could plan save lives? The Streets for People plan aims to create “low-stress” walking and biking networks, enabling people to travel to their destinations feeling safe and comfortable without having to take a car. The lowest-stress facility is often called a shared-use path, which is a bike and pedestrian path separated completely from car traffic, like the Sacramento River Trail and the county-run American River Parkway. The city of Sacramento has close to 80 miles of such paths but, the plan notes, “although (it is) expansive, the shared-use path network is disjointed, presenting difficulty for people connecting to various destinations.” In other words, the plan says the network doesn’t provide a realistic option for getting to most destinations: Paths end before people can arrive where they need to go.

The plan also found that the city has many “bikeways that do not provide the level of comfort to be usable for the general population.” According to the document, only 47% of communities “have access to essential needs by bike”: People may be forced onto high-speed, high-vehicle-traffic routes such as Florin or Fruitridge roads to get anywhere. The plan generally recommends creating more separation between drivers and people who are not in cars. It also recommends, among other things, increasing maintenance, widening certain sidewalks and planting more shade trees. As part of the Streets for People project, staffers and consultants — with significant input from residents — identified 612 specific intersections where safety improvements are needed. Lao, a Sacramento father, was fatally struck last month while walking at one of the intersections on the list: Marysville Boulevard and Del Paso Road. His widow, Stella Xiong, has been left to face the holidays without him while raising their five children. The Sacramento Bee identified seven other intersections in the plan where fatal crashes occurred in 2025.

At Tuesday’s council meeting, Dickinson also raised his own priority intersection and amended the plan to include it: Rio Linda Boulevard and South Avenue. Sitting on the dais, Dickinson did not say what happened at the Del Paso Heights crossroads that made him call it “acute in terms of needed attention.” The intersection was the site of fatal crashes in both February 2021 and in February 2023 which left three people dead. Amritpal Singh, 61, and Ryan Jacob Murphy, 38, were killed in 2021. No infrastructure improvements had been made by the time a crash killed Juan Ramon Flores, 78, two years later.

Flores was a grandfather and, his wife Iris previously told The Bee, “a jokester.” She remembered that before he was fatally struck while on his regular evening walk in 2023, he would always wait up for her to get home from the night shift. When she pulled up to the Del Paso Heights home after a long night of work, he would be sitting on the front porch with a hot cup of coffee for her.",34,1764786512.0,Sacramento,11,0.96,False

Preview:

Lily Adams was unusually short; she had long blonde hair that reached down her back, and she had a pair of sharp wooden glasses that were slightly too big to fit her face. Ralphie agreed to meet her at Trident, a coffee shop, bookstore hybrid that was open late. One of the very few bookstores that still existed.

Lily stood out because, despite being integrated, she forgoed a CelTec paycheck, which operated its own news network that was globally broadcast, isolated from the autonomous reporter. CelTec was infamous for not including information that demeaned them, and threatened that the autonomous reporter was an illegal operation. But despite attempts to take it down, it always cropped back up. It was common that smaller, outspoken reporters would disappear. Lily had a security team constantly surrounding her.

The New Times Report was nationally recognized as the biggest media company on The Autonomous Reporter. It was also the only company in the world that used newspapers, as it was the most secure way to reliably keep the flow of information.

Ralphie had gotten to the coffee shop a little earlier so he could get a croissant, one of his favorite snacks. He sat there tapping his fingers rapidly on the table. He was unusually nervous as he understood the stakes at hand.

When Lily arrived, she grabbed coffee before she walked over to Ralphie, giving him a brief hug with a huge smile.

1pdc172,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1pdc172/a_few_practical_tips_for_milk_handling_and_flat/,A few practical tips for milk handling and Flat Whites drinks after 5 months with the Creatista Pro,"I’ve been using the Creatista Pro daily for about five months now, and I figured I’d share a few things I wish I had known earlier, mostly about milk handling, cleaning, and getting better results for milk-based drinks.



**1. Keep milk residue out of the drip tray**

If you let the steam-wand auto-purge blow milk into the drip tray, it starts getting moldy and smells *really* fast.  
My routine:

* After steaming, wipe the wand with a thick, slightly damp paper towel.
* Then hold the paper towel just under the tip during the initial part of the self-clean so it absorbs the milk instead of letting it shoot into the tray.
* As soon as the purge switches to water, remove the towel, throw it away, and let the rest drain normally.

This has basically eliminated all sour smells.



**2. Wash the milk jug immediately**

If you let milk sit, it sticks to the walls of the milk jug, starts to smell, and becomes harder to clean. A quick wash with dish soap right after steaming avoids the whole ""old milk"" problem completely.



**3. Deep-clean the steam wand weekly**

The machine’s automatic purges aren’t enough long-term. Running the proper weekly wand-clean cycle really keeps the microfoam quality consistent.



**4. Fixing weak milk drinks: adjust espresso volume**

By default, an espresso on the Creatista Pro is about **50 ml**, which is far larger than the usual 25–30 ml.  
For plain espresso I don’t mind it, but for milk drinks it dilutes the flavor a lot.

What finally gave me coffee-shop strength flat whites:

* Pull **two ristretto shots with the Ristretto mode** set **3 ticks below default**, giving me \~25 ml each (so 50 ml total, while in Flat White mode, the machine won't let you set the shot volume below \~40 ml each).
* Steam the milk using Milk Only, and for a flat white I set the jug to the Min fill line.

The taste difference is massive, no more watery flat whites.



**5. Steaming consistency changes depending on machine temperature**

If the machine is ""cold"", the foam texture is different from the second or third milk session. This directly affects latte-art potential.

My baseline for a flat white:

* Machine cold → steam level 2
* Subsequent steamings → steam level 1

Matching the wand’s actual behavior matters more than just leaving it on a single setting.



**6. Latte art is absolutely doable on this machine**

Not the easiest, but doable! Some notes that helped me a lot:

* Use whole/full fat cow milk.
* Adjust foam level to get a paint-like consistency.
* Swirl+tap the jug well before pouring.
* Always ""prep"" the espresso base by breaking the crema first: pour a little milk from higher up to integrate the surface before you start drawing.
* Once the base is uniform, *then* go for your design.

This combo finally gave me shapes that look intentional instead of accidental.



**7. Sweetening without ruining the art**

I like keeping the latte art visible while drinking.  
What I do: add sugar/stevia to the empty cup first, then pull the espresso on top.  
Everything dissolves automatically, and you don’t have to stir afterward and destroy the pattern.

Ideas for either (or both) of them would be appreciated! Ideally between $30-60 for each of them, but willing to go up to $100-120.

**Mom**: late 50s, physician. Frugal, but when she does buy things, she buys things of very high quality (ex. her jewelry, clothing, coats are all WELL out of my budget, in the hundreds or thousands). **Likes/hobbies**: running (but has running gear), reading (but I'm terrible at judging what she likes), coffee, and tea. She's very healthy, but not alternative medicine/herbal remedies-type, if that makes sense. **Past gifts that she liked:** electric kettle, Click and Grow, Darn Tough socks, very nice gloves, sapphire earrings (joint gift with my brothers, def over budget for just me!).

**Dad**: late 50s, physician as well. LOVES to buy himself stuff. Buys himself things like tools, stainless steel pans, sports cars and car accessories, a smoker (to smoke meat), medieval swords, etc. He'll buy just about anything that intrigues him lol. He likes tech stuff, but has SO much already, and is always buying more. **Likes/hobbies**: running as well (but also already has most gear), playing video games on his computer, watching history videos on Youtube. **Past gifts that he liked**: beer of the month and sausage of the month subscriptions, Atlas Obscura book, crocs, dash cam, etc.

\[I've looked at general gift lists for men and women and nothing really stands out. For my mom it's because I don't think she'd want most of that stuff, and for my dad it's usually because he's already recently bought himself the things listed.\]",1,1764785991.0,GiftIdeas,9,1.0,False
